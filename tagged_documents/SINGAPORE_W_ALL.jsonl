{'text': 'Question: If Gulliver is an unreliable narrator, the narrator of\nRasselas is a dictator.\n\n\nAs such both are vehicles for distortion.\n\n\nWould you agree with this assessment?\n\n\nAnswer: The narrative technique of Gulliver\'s Travels and Rasselas\ndiffers vastly.\n\n\nIn the former, the narrator is a character of the story while in the\nlatter, the narrator is the detached and omniscient type.\n\n\nBoth stories, being very different in nature, would warrant very\ndifferent responses to the story as well as to the narrators of each book.\n\n\nIn Gulliver\'s Travels, we respond to Gulliver, the narrator,\ndifferently.\n\n\nFirstly, because of the fantastic nature of the tale and secondly,\nbecause Swift the author is not the same as Gulliver the narrator and that\nSwift is satirising Gulliver.\n\n\nTherefore our response to the narrator of Gulliver\'s Travels is often\nmore tainted with suspicion.\n\n\nAnd in Rasselas, the use of the all-knowing narrator also alters the\nways we see the story because such a narrator is at liberty to " impose" on\nthe readers anything he sees fit.\n\n\nIn Gulliver\'s Travels, because we are seeing the entire story through\nGulliver\'s eyes and from his perspective and he is a character actively\ninvolved in the storyline itself, it therefore becomes inevitable that an\nelement of unreliability would exist in the narration.\n\n\nBecause we are, after all, receiving a second-hand account that had\nbeen subjected to Gulliver\'s own questionable sense of assessment and\nvalue-judgement.\n\n\nIn fact, the opening letters of the novel already sets in us such a\nmood of uncertainty.\n\n\nThe publisher and Gulliver appears to be giving us different\naccounts, with Gulliver accusing the Publisher of altering his manuscript, he\nsaid,"You have either omitted some material circumstance, or minced or\nchanged them in such a manner, that I do hardly know mine own work."\nTherefore, right from the beginning, we are told that Gulliver\'s so called "\ntruthful" account has been tampered with and as such, it forces us to\nquestion the reliability of what we are reading.\n\n\nAlso, we, as readers, are several removes away - with Swift as the\nultimate controller of the story who controls the narrator, Gulliver, whose\nmanuscripts had been tampered with by the Publisher, and lastly, us.\n\n\nAs such, all these multiple layerings and manipulation makes us\nquestion the authenticity of the story, as much as Gulliver claims it to be\ntrue.\n\n\nThis opening atmosphere of unreliability is perpetuated throughout\nthe novel by Gulliver himself.\n\n\nGulliver is very prone to exaggeration.\n\n\nFor example, in Book I, he said this of the Lilliputians.\n\n\n" I confess I was often tempted, while they were passing backwards\nand forwards on my Body to seize Forty of Fifty of the first that came in my\nReach, and dash them against the Ground." This is an instance of exaggeration\nbecause at that point of time, Gulliver had only one hand free.\n\n\nPerhaps, seizing ten or twenty would be a more reasonable claim, than\nForty or Fifty.\n\n\nHence, Gulliver\'s tendency to exaggerate makes him a less reliable\nnarrator.\n\n\nGulliver\'s state of mind is also one of the factors that makes him an\nunreliable narrator.\n\n\nThe first example, is at the end of Book II after his escape from\nBrobdingnag.\n\n\nBy then, Gulliver had totally lost his sense of perspective.\n\n\nHe told the rescue crew, " let one of the crew put his finger into\nthe Ring, and take the Box out of the sea into the ship, and so into the\nCaptain\'s Cabin." And " I was equally confounded at the Sight of so many\nPignies; for such I took them to be, after having so long accustomed my eyes\nto the monstrous objects I had left."\n\n\nEveryone, including his family, though he had gone mad.\n\n\nIndeed, when the narrator loses his perspective or mind, we as\nreaders are also de-stabilised.\n\n\nHence, Gulliver\'s unreliability distorts our views too.\n\n\nAnother instance of Gulliver losing his mind, is at the end of the\nnovel.\n\n\nAfter spending some time in Houyhnhnmland he becomes absolutely\nirrational.\n\n\nHe said, " But I must freely confess, that the many virtues of those\nexcellent Quadrupeds placed in opposite view to human corruptions, had so far\nopened my Eyes, and enlarged my understanding, that I began to view the\nActions and Passion of man in a very different light;"\n\n\n" In a very different light" indeed!\n\n\nFor he acts and behaves in a most ridiculous manner.\n\n\ny " rational ideals and rejects the company of man.\n\n\nEven the sight of his beloved family makes him sick.\n\n\nBy this time, Gulliver is totally unreliable as a narrator because he\nis now irrational and we just cannot accept his views.\n\n\nBecause the narrator himself is disoriented, our views are inevitably\ndistorted by his madness.\n\n\nAlso, on the grounds that since Swift the author is different from\nGulliver, the narrator, one can already say that the narrator would\ninevitably be unreliable.\n\n\nThis especially so as Swift satirises Gulliver in the story.\n\n\nTherefore, Gulliver\'s account of his experiences and responses will\nalways be regarded by readers with a certain amount of disbelief and\nsuspicions.\n\n\nAs for Rasselas, the role of the narrator is sometimes played by the\ncharacters themselves but more often by an unseen narrator.\n\n\nBy the use of an unseen narrator, the way we see the story is\ninevitably dictated.\n\n\nThis is because this unseen narrator is an all-knowing type.\n\n\nAnd in this sense, we are at his " mercy" for he does not give us\nalternatives.\n\n\nFor example, in Chapter 1, after describing Happy Valley, he said, "\nSuch was the appearance of security and delight which this retirement\nafforded, that they to whom it was new always desired that it might be\nperpetual; and as those, on whom the iron gate had once closed, were never\nsuffered to return, the effect of longer experience could not be known."\nTherefore, we are forced to accept what he says because he is " all-knowing".\n\n\nWhether or not what he says is true is something that we cannot\nquestion, because there are no other options.\n\n\nUnlike in Gulliver\'s Travels, where the narrator is a character, we\ncan at least question the reliability of his account.\n\n\nBut here is Rasselas, this is denied of us and as such, we are\ndictated by the narrator.\n\n\nOne of this narrator\'s techniques is to cushion the harsh reality\nthat occurs.\n\n\nHe does not present the facts as it occurs but rather, he cushions\nit.\n\n\nThat is, serious issues would be turned by his narrative style, into "\nlight-hearted" comedy.\n\n\nFor example, the narrator transforms the seriousness of the\nastronomer\'s self-deception into comedy.\n\n\nHe allows the astronomer to say, " One day as I was looking on the\nfields withering with heat, I felt in my mind a sudden wish that I could send\nrain on the southern mountains,....In the hurry of my imagination I commanded\nrain to fall,....I found that the clouds had listened to my lips."\n\n\nBy doing so, he is inevitably controlling our responses to the story\nby emphasising on the morals to be learnt, rather than the harshness of the\nsituation.\n\n\nThis is also seen in the way the narrator chooses to hint and imply\nhis morals, rather than by overtly stating it.\n\n\nFor example, after Rasselas discovered the hypocrisy of the " wise\nand happy man", he said,\n\n\n" The prince, went away convinced of the emptiness of rhetorical\nsound, and the inefficacy of polished periods and studied sentences." By\nallowing Rasselas to say this himself after the experience he went through,\nit subtly reinforces the moral of this situation.\n\n\nBy using such a means, the narrator subtly controls and dictates our\nattitude towards the story.\n\n\nAt times, the narrator allows the characters to speak for themselves.\n\n\nBut even this is ultimately controlled by him for his " heavy"\npresence is still felt because he sometimes intrudes and makes comments.\n\n\nOr sometimes, he would already have set up the framework or\nbackground, in which the characters speak, whereby our views and attitudes\nare ultimately controlled.\n\n\nTherefore, Gulliver is an unreliable narrator, because his sanity is\nquestionable and because he is a character being satirised in the story, his\naccount is therefore even more subjective.\n\n\nAs such, it distorts our views.\n\n\nAs for Rasselas, the narrator is a dictator for he controls and\ndictates how we should see the characters and the incidents.\n\n\nBut it is not necessarily a means of distortion.\n\n\nFor this unseen narrator is at least closer to Johnson than Gulliver\nthe narrator is to Swift. \n\n\n\n\nQ: Would you agree that it is possible for each reader to interpret\nwho is the hero of Paradise Lost according to his or her predilections?\n\n\nA: Paradise Lost is an epic poem based on Christianity.\n\n\nAnd one does not need to know a lot about Christianity in order to\nknow that God represents goodness, while Satan, evil, and therefore,\neverything bad.\n\n\nIn fact this is a basic assumption that one has even before reading\nthe poem.\n\n\nHowever, in Paradise Lost this basic assumption is brought to\nquestion.\n\n\nThis is not to say that Paradise Lost depicts God as bad.\n\n\nOn the contrary, the goodness of God is never in question.\n\n\nIt is in the character Satan that all our prior assumptions are\nshaken.\n\n\nAs much as we know that Satan is evil, Milton\'s portrayal of him is\nsuch that he emerges as a hero in his own right.\n\n\nIn the beginning of Paradise Lost it is Satan that we see.\n\n\nMilton took pains to describe Satan and his fall.\n\n\nWe are never allowed to forget that what Satan had done was\nessentially wrong.\n\n\nBut yet, it is inevitable from the portrayal that we feel closer to\nSatan and Hell at this point.\n\n\nGod in Heaven seems so far away.\n\n\nWith the emphasis placed on Satan right from the beginning, Milton\ndescribes Satan\'s stature.\n\n\nHe wrote,  \n\n\n" he, above the rest In shape and gesture proudly eminent, Stood\nlike a tower; his form had yet not lost All her original brightness,"\n \n\n\nTherefore there is a quality of grandeur and heroism in Satan\'s\nstature, which cannot be denied.\n\n\nMilton also described Satan in terms of " dauntless courage".\n\n\nAnd justice is done to this description when we see Satan\nvolunteering himself for the difficult task of searching the truth of the\nprophecy.\n\n\nNone of the other devils would dare to undertake this task.\n\n\nMilton described them,  \n\n\n" but all sat mute, Pondering the danger with deep thoughts;"\n \n\n\nExcept Satan,  \n\n\n" Whom now transcendent glory raised Above his fellows, with\nmonarchal pride, conscious of highest worth,"  \n\n\nHe alone dared to undertake " the dreadful voyage" and deserves the\ndescription of " dauntless courage".\n\n\nHence there is indeed a heroic quality about him.\n\n\nAnd what makes Satan even more heroic is that he is the only figure\nin Paradise Lost in whom we see in full the struggle that he undergoes and\nthe strength that arises from this conflict.\n\n\nIn Book Four Satan talks about his own struggle - - what he had lost.\n\n\nHe said,  \n\n\n" O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams, That bring to my\nremembrance from what state I fell, How glorious once above thy sphere; Till\npride and worse ambition threw me down, warring in heav\'n against heav\'n\'s\nmatchless King."  \n\n\nBut after deliberating about what he had done and what he had lost,\nhe stoically said,  \n\n\n" So farewell hope, and with hope farewell fear, Farewell remorse:\nall good to me is lost; Evil, be thou my good;"  \n\n\nAs much as we know that Satan has sinned and is therefore in the\nwrong, he still emerges as a hero.\n\n\nFor the struggle that we see him undergoing is presented with a\nsense of realism.\n\n\nThat is, we identify with his struggle and we sympathise him.\n\n\nOn top of that, it is through this conflict that Satan\'s strength\nand power is shown.\n\n\nHe wins our sympathy and, more importantly, our admiration, when he\ncourageously faces his struggle, knowing well that the odds are against him.\n\n\nOn the other hand, God is portrayed as a tyrant.\n\n\nHe commands his angels to adore Him.\n\n\nHe said, " Adore the Son, and honor him as me." Thereafter, the\nangels worship Him.\n\n\nBut as for Satan, he earns the respect and praise from his cohorts.\n\n\nTherefore Milton\'s portrayal of Satan certainly makes him an\nimpressive figure.\n\n\nAnd it is not difficult for one to interpret him as the hero of\nParadise Lost even though we are constantly reminded of his wrongdoings.\n\n\nIt is precisely this that makes him all the more attractive.\n\n\nFor he is the only character in the poem, unlike God and the Son,\nwho earns his heroic stature.\n\n\nIt may seem ironical that Milton should choose to portray Satan\ninstead of Christ in a heroic light. \n\n\nBut in Milton\'s Paradise Lost everything begins with God, even\nSatan acknowledges God as " Heav\'n\'s matchless King".\n\n\nPerhaps in choosing to give Satan a heroic stature, Milton is using\nSatan\'s pride and rebellion to illuminate the enigmatic question of free\nwill.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd541eea0-82f3-4699-813b-c65f413aa4a6', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.621815+00:00', 'english_score': 0.98423171043396, 'non_english_score': 0.01576828956604004}
{'text': 'Question: What significant features did a) the can vuong movement b)\nturn of the century rural rebellions in North and Northeast Siam c) the Hsaya\nSan rebellion have in common?\n\n\nWhat major differences were there in the three cases?\n\n\nAnswer: Colonial or colonial-like policies in the 3 three states in\nquestion had good and bad consequences.\n\n\nDepending on how it is viewed, one manifestation of the above was the\npresence of resistance movements.\n\n\nThe ma can vuong movement, the rural rebellions in North and\nNorth-east Thailand and the Saya San Rebellion though occurring existing at\ndifferent times had more or less similar goals and in a way used similar\nmethods to appeal to the people.\n\n\nMoreover, their appeal was mainly towards those who were oppressed -\nthe peasants.\n\n\nThe three resistance movements aspired to replace the ruling body.\n\n\nThe can-vuong movement intended to get rid of the French colonialists.\n\n\nThey were also unhappy with the seemingly complacent royal rulers and\nthe Mandarin collaborators.\n\n\nThey saw these collaborators as betraying their own people.\n\n\nThey wrote scathing messages to these.\n\n\nFor example, Phan Dinh Phung wrote, " You must realise that wherever\nthe French go, there flock around them groups of petty men who offer plans\nand tricks to gain the enemy\'s confidence...\n\n\nThey use every expedient to squeeze the people out of their\npossessions." ( Marr, 1971, pg 67).\n\n\nThey also saw the emperor as a p puppet ruler, controlled by the\nFrench.\n\n\nThus, they wanted to get rid of the French, so that the emperor could\nrule once again.\n\n\nThe Thai rebellions regarded the ruling body as enemies.\n\n\nThey intended to " negate the state", and live independently of the\ngovernment.\n\n\nHowever, the Chiangmai rebellion ( 1899-1900) was more radical in\nthat it intended to set up a government ( Tanabe, 1984, pg 98) while the "\nHoly Men" Rebellion in 1901 were less so, intending to make the village the\ncentre of their new society.\n\n\n( Tanabe, pg 124).\n\n\nThis seemed natural as the latter of the two took place in the most\nbackward part of Thailand.\n\n\n( Tanabe, pg 129).\n\n\nThe Saya San Rebellion intended to " restore Burmese rule revive\nBuddhism, and re-establish the traditional order of things in Burma." ( Adas,\n1974, pg 200.) He planned to do this by getting rid of the British and\nrestoring the monarchy.\n\n\nAnother common feature was their appeal to the peasants, and their\nmethods used.\n\n\nThe can vuong movement involved mainly the peasants, who were led by\nthe scholar gentry leaders.\n\n\nThis was because the peasants\' lot was very bad.\n\n\nThey were badly exploited by the French.\n\n\nMoreover, the can vuong movement appealed to the people because it\nused symbols familiar to the people.\n\n\nThe movement captured the emperor and was used as a symbol of unity.\n\n\n( Marr, 1971, pg 51.) With Confucian influence, the people highly\nregarded the emperor and seeing the emperor fleeing to the mountains, were\nmoved to fight the French.\n\n\nThese sentiments were exacerbated by the Can Vuong Edict.\n\n\nThe movement also used reference to previous experiences against\nagainst foreign presence ( China and Mongolia) and also brought up popular\nfigures of the past like Ku Yuan and Chao Tsui who righteously stood up for\nwhat was right.\n\n\n( Marr, 1971 pg 50.) The millenarian movements of Thailand appealed\nto the peasants too.\n\n\nThe economic conditions were deteriorating especially with the\nincrease in central control by the government.\n\n\nThey resented this greater increase in control especially as their\nethnic background was Lao.\n\n\nTheir historical background of being " conquered people" made them\nregard the government reforms as interfering in their lives.\n\n\nPersonalities like Ong Man and Phaya Phap were familiar symbols,\ngarnering support among the people.\n\n\nThey were regarded as " phu mi bun" or " men of great merit.", who\nhad supernatural powers to fight against bullets and other weapons.\n\n\nThey were believed to usher in a period of peace and prosperity.\n\n\nTheir use of chants, amulets, holy water and other rituals appealed\nto the peasants, who were familiar with these.\n\n\nSimilarly, in Burma, the Saya San Rebellion appealed mainly to the\npeasant classes.\n\n\nThe economic condition in Burma was also quite depressing especially\nduring the late 1920s and the 1930s.\n\n\nThe rice economy was subject to much fluctuations of the\ninternational prices and when they dipped in 1930s, the peasants suffered\nconsiderably.\n\n\nThe tenant farmers could not pay the rent and those who borrowed\nmoney could not return it.\n\n\nMoreover, jobs were not readily available and with the presence of\nIndian immigrants.\n\n\nAmidst all this, Saya San and his Galon Association arose, with his\nroyal regalia and golden galon symbols.\n\n\nThese greatly stirred the people because they believed in the coming\nof a period of great peace & stability brought by a figure of royalty.\n\n\nAs a result, Saya San gained a large following.\n\n\nMoving on now to differences in the various movements, One areas was\nleadership.\n\n\nBoth the rural rebellions in Thailand and Burma were regarded as\nmillenarian movements of sorts, having strong links at least to the religious\nand historical traditions of the past.\n\n\nTheir leader-ship was concentrated in religious figures of great\npower and dynamism.\n\n\nHowever, even here, Saya San could be seen as a more politicised\nfigure than most historians credit him for.\n\n\nPatricia Herbert claims that due to his involvement with the Young\nMen\'s Buddhist Association ( YMBA) and the General Council of Buddhist\nAssociations ( GCBA), he was already exposed to political methods and goings\non.\n\n\n( Herbert, 1982, pg 11) He also realised that was not just another\ntraditional leader then.\n\n\nThe leadership of the can vuong movement was in the hands of the\nscholar-gentry class.\n\n\nIt seemed natural that they were the leaders of the movement as they\nwere more in touch with the agrarian lifestyle than any other segments of\nsociety.\n\n\nThey travelled much more than other classes of society and were "\nclosely rooted to the soil".\n\n\nThey thus could mix well with the peasants.\n\n\n( Marr, 1971, pg 52-3).\n\n\nUnlike the other two movements, the can vuong movement was seen to\nuse poetry as an influential mode to reach out to the people.\n\n\nThey did not use much tangible symbols or rituals.\n\n\nDue to their scholar gentry class background, they were used to\nwriting poetry and were adept at it.\n\n\nThis was of great influence in stirring the people\'s emotions against\nthe French.\n\n\n( Marr, 1971 pg 76) In fact, the movement is known as to have had\nconsiderable sway over nationalists like Ho Chi Minh.\n\n\nThe can vuong movement was marked by its belief in " If we fail, hope\nshifts to our sons." ( Marr, 1971, pg 44.) This is what gave the scholar\ngentries the added impetus to fight against the French.\n\n\nThey believed that ultimately their cause would be fulfilled.\n\n\nHence, they were able to courageously stand against French naval\nartillery, which was far more superior to theirs.\n\n\nThis was different from the others, as the participants in those\nbelieved in the power and invulnerability of the amulets used.\n\n\nOne final point to note about the Saya San Rebellions in Burma\nconcerns the outbreak of ethnic clashes between the Burmese and the Chinese\nand the Burma and the Indians.\n\n\nThough in Thailand, acrimonious relations existed between the Thais\nand the Chinese, they never reached as violent proportions as in Burma.\n\n\nAt the end of the rebellion, about 120 Indians were killed and 900\nwere wounded.\n\n\nThe clashes were thus very violent, stemming from already mentioned\ncauses.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that each movement had their own\nparticular significance to the community in question.\n\n\nWhere colonial powers were present, the nationalists of that time or\nlater looked upon these movements lessons to learn from or as sources of\ninspiration.\n\n\nThe monks involved in the Saya San Rebellion were later more and\ninvolved in politics too.\n\n\nAs for the Thai rebellion, it signalled a greater consciousness of\nthe peasant, who were brave enough to stand up for an alternative view to the\ngovernment. \n\n\n\n\n Introduction \n\n\nIt cannot be denied that the points brought out in the question are\ntrue.\n\n\nThat is, those points did occur in the mainland Southeast Asian\nterritories.\n\n\nRobequain mentioned that the justification of colonisation is not by\nlooking at financial achievements alone ( Robequain 1944: 348).\n\n\nNeither should one then look merely at these achievements as given,\nwithout examining the flip-side to it.\n\n\nOne should ask then at what expense have these benefits been reached.\n\n\nThis will then help us come to some clearer picture of the situation\nand whether the indigenous population did benefit from the economic changes\nof the colonial ( semi-colonial) orders.\n\n\n( a) Production of commodities, especially rice, increased\ndramatically.\n\n\nThe actual production of rice did greatly rise.\n\n\nHowever, the consumption of rice in Vietnam actually fell ( Scott,\n1976: 87).\n\n\nThis was the situation even during the Great Depression.\n\n\nWhat this meant was that though the production of rice was\nincreasing, much of it was being exported and did not actually reach the\nmouths of the indigenous population.\n\n\nIn Burma, Tate suggests that though material progress was\nexperienced, the local people received a disproportionate share in the\ncountry\'s new prosperity ( Tate, 1979: 144).\n\n\nThis was illustrated similarly in the poor distribution of the wages\nin Indo-China.\n\n\nIn the 1930\'s the average wage rate of the whole of Indo-China\nrepresented less than 1/12 of their French counterparts ( Tate, 1979: 345).\n\n\nWhere Siam is concerned, the distribution seemed fairer except what\nthey received was heavily taxed.\n\n\nThis shows clearly that at least in the colonially controlled areas,\nthough production increased, the indigenous people were not benefiting.\n\n\n( b) Land area under cultivation expanded greatly.\n\n\nMore land was being used.\n\n\nHowever the actual productivity of land is not mentioned.\n\n\nIn fact, Bastin and Benda assert that it did not ( 1968: 76-7).\n\n\nAs there is no limitless frontier, Burma experienced problems of land\nshortage.\n\n\nWhat this led to was a move to look for jobs, which in themselves\nbecame pronouncedly scarce in the Depression years.\n\n\nThough land was getting less and less available, the authorities did\nnot comprehend the situation enough to stop the problem.\n\n\nSo, although better farming methods and more high quality\nfertilizers were introduced, they were not effective as the cost was high.\n\n\nMoreover whatever credit facilities were provided benefited those\nwho were already well-to-do.\n\n\nMobility from tenants to landowners was kept to a minimal degree.\n\n\nSoon, there were large numbers of peasants and a small group of\nlandowners.\n\n\nNon-agriculturists who owned land increased from 18% in 1906-07 to\n31% in 1929-30.\n\n\nThough land area used increased, it did not actually benefit the\nindigenous population to a large extent as land was in the hands of a few.\n\n\nThis too was also the case in Vietnam, Cochin-China to be exact.\n\n\nHowever, in Burma, during the Great Depression, even the landowners\nlost their property to the chettiar moneylenders.\n\n\nSiam too suffered from the unequal distribution of land though it\ndoes not seem to be as bad as the above in Burma.\n\n\n( c) International trade, both exports and imports, boomed.\n\n\nThe situation here has to be viewed with a pinch of salt.\n\n\nOne should cast one\'s mind back to the signing of the unequal\ntreaties, beginning with the Bowning treaty in 1855.\n\n\nThese treaties gave protection over the colonial goods, which meant\nthat what profits they received would be at the expense of local profits (\nSteinberg: 215).\n\n\nMoreover Tate mentioned that trade in Vietnam carried on such that\nthe necessities of France were imported and sold to French people while the\nVietnamese were flooded with French luxury goods which they rarely needed or\ncould afford ( Tate, 1979: 345).\n\n\nAside from the above, international trade meant that the indigenous\npeople were in a more vulnerable position, as they were more open to the\nfluctuations in prices and demand.\n\n\nWhere there were slumps or any other international economic\ncatastrophes, the people were to suffer even more.\n\n\nBesides a greater burden being passed on to the colonially ruled\npeople ( Bastin and Benda, 1968: 79), the people of Thailand also suffered.\n\n\nIn the 1930s the people in the Angthong province depended on rice as\na staple income. \n\n\nDue to the world-wide Depression, farmers and speculators suffered\nsevere losses.\n\n\nJobs were difficult to get and there was a general fall in the\nstandard of living, as evidenced by the increasing number of middle and lower\nclass farmers ( Chatthip 1981: 199-206).\n\n\nThere was a drop in income for farmers from 400 baht to 125 baht.\n\n\nThe situation became so bad that families began to sell their gold\nornaments ( Chatthip 1981: 211-16).\n\n\nIn Burma and Vietnam, the agriculturists also suffered.\n\n\nThe real value of rice fell and with constantly increasing prices\nagainst an unstable income, the situation was bad.\n\n\nMichael Adas actually suggests that even before the Depression\nthings were bad ( Adas 1974: 147).\n\n\nMore importantly, the people of Burma were suffering from a loss of\nthe previously freely available resources of the forest.\n\n\nThe British recognised the potential in the timber industry and\nplaced restrictions on the indigenous use of forest products, such as\ntaxation ( Scott, 1976: 63-65).\n\n\nWhat all these show in fact is that though international trade\nboomed, the indigenous people did not seem to benefit in actuality.\n\n\n( d) Population grew rapidly, both through immigration and natural\nbirths Without a doubt, population did increase.\n\n\nAccording to Bastin and Benda, it increased from 26m in 1830 to\n123-odd m.\n\n\nin 1940.\n\n\nThis was brought about by the colonial and semi-colonial\nencouragement in immigration and also improved welfare of the people.\n\n\nWhere there were deadly diseases like cholera, they were eventually\nwiped out but anyhow reduced mortality rates.\n\n\nMoreover the population increase reflected the success somewhat of\neconomic change and the stability which the colonial governments brought to\nareas like Burma and Indochina.\n\n\nEven where hospitals and medical improvements were scarce, they\nwere a first.\n\n\nHowever, the increasing immigrant population created a lot of\ncompetition for jobs.\n\n\nIn Burma, this led to much communal violence, culminating in the\n1931 Saya San rebellion.\n\n\nIndians were seen as more efficient and the Burmese thus lost out\non jobs.\n\n\nWith the presence of Chettiar moneylenders, the resentment\nheightened.\n\n\nIn Cambodia the indigenous population felt threatened too by the\nVietnamese present, who were filling up clerical and administrative posts.\n\n\nIn Thailand the resentment was felt against the Chinese.\n\n\nThe indigenous people were slowly becoming more dependent on the\nChinese ( Bastin and Benda 1968:75).\n\n\nConclusion It appears that there are more negative effects than\npositive.\n\n\nHowever, two points must be taken note of.\n\n\nThe population increase in itself was a counter-effect to whatever\npositive effects of economic change.\n\n\nRather than continually pointing the finger at the colonial or\nsemi-colonial order, this local factor was also a reason for much hardship.\n\n\nMoreover, with the immigrant population tense situations were\ncreated.\n\n\nAnother point to note is the fact that whatever technological\nadvancement achieved must be attributed largely to the colonial presence.\n\n\nThat is, if one were to imagine an advanced mainland Southeast Asia\nwithout colonial initiation, it would be quite hard.\n\n\nHowever, David B.\n\n\nJohnston suggests that Thailand as an example of the absence of\nformal

{'text': 'Q: Write a critique on population planning in Singapore since 1959.\n\n\nA Population planning has played a significant role in Singapore.\n\n\nSince the 1960s to the present day, the government of Singapore has\nused population planning very effectively to control the trends of population\ngrowth in Singapore.\n\n\nBasically, the trend of population growth since 1959 has been a\ndownward one. \n\n\nTable 1: Rates of Natural Increase For 1958 to 1989.\n\n\nSources: Cheng 1989;p.163.\n\n\n& The Straits Times, 17 Dec 1990. \n\n\nAs seen from Table 1, the rate of natural increase has declined\nsteadily from 34.1 per thousand in 1958, to a low of 10.9 per thousand in\n1983.\n\n\nFrom 1985 to 1989, the rate fluctuated between 11.4 per thousand and\n14.8 per thousand.\n\n\nThough it has increased somewhat as compared to 1983, the present\nrates are still very low as compared to 1958.\n\n\nThus we see that in the short span of approximately 25 years ( from\n1958 to 1983), Singapore has managed to reduce its initially high growth\nrates drastically.\n\n\nThe population planning in Singapore can be divided into two fairly\ndistinct periods ( refer to Chart 1 below); firstly, there was the pre-1987\nperiod, where the main thrust of the programme was to encourage women to "\nstop at two" ( Cheng 1989;p.165).\n\n\nThe post-1987 period was a complete " turnabout" ( Cheng 1989;p.172)\nfrom the previous population policy.\n\n\nThis period " aimed at selective procreation" ( Cheng 1989;p.172)\nbased on affordability.\n\n\nI will now deal with each period separately. \n\n\nChart 1: The Population Planning Policies introduced in Singapore\nsince 1947.\n\n\nAdapted from Cheng 1989;p 165 \n\n\nAs was seen from Table 1, the rate of natural increase in 1958 was\nvery high at 34.1 per thousand.\n\n\nThe crude birth rate was 39.4 per thousand in 1959 ( Cheung\n1989;p.35, Tab.5.5).\n\n\nThe high growth rates then, meant that if population growth was not\nhalted, the numbers would have been too numerous for a small island like\nSingapore.\n\n\nIn fact, projections have indicated that with the " big family norm"\nin the 1960s, Singapore\'s population would have hit five million in the year\n2000 if the growth was not curbed ( The Straits Times 2 March, 1987).\n\n\nBeing a small island, Singapore could not risk having a large\npopulation which it would not be able to support.\n\n\nThe rationale was that if the population was too large, it would lead\nto problems like mass poverty, which could have left a young, and thus\nvulnerable country like Singapore the, impoverished.\n\n\nAs it was in the late 1950s and early 1960s, high unemployment, poor\nhealth care and educational facilities made things look quite dismal.\n\n\nThe earliest attempt at population planning was in 1947 when the\nFamily Planning Association was formed.\n\n\nBetween 1949 and 1968, there were " 87,921 new acceptors" ( Cheng\n1989;p.166) as a result of the Association\'s efforts.\n\n\nThough the number of acceptors was not very great, the Association\nhelped by " creating an awareness among the people towards accepting family\nplanning" ( Cheng 1989;p.166).\n\n\nFrom 1966 to 1985, under the Singapore Family Planning and Population\nBoard ( SFPPB), which was established in 1966, there were 387,702 new\nacceptors.\n\n\nAfter 1969, due to the " saturation effect" ( Cheng 1989;p.166) of\nnew acceptors, the Gross Reproduction Rate ( GRR), which fell from 2.187 to\n1.568 in the period 1966 to 1969, " showed signs of levelling off" ( Cheng\n1989;p.166).\n\n\nTherefore, in 1970, the government enforced the " legislation of\ninduced abortion and voluntary sterilisation" ( Cheng 1989;p.166).\n\n\nThe GRR was thus further reduced.\n\n\nThe " stop-at-two" policy with its many incentives and disincentives\nwas introduced in 1972.\n\n\nSome of the incentives and disincentives included " no-pay maternity\nleave after the second child, income tax relief up to the third child only,\nhigher accouchement fees for the fourth and subsequent child, lower priority\nfor admission to primary school, and no permission for families with more\nthan three children to sublet their flats." ( Cheng 1989;p.166), also helped\nbring down the GRR, as the number of abortions increased year after year.\n\n\nA combination of the above policies, resulted in the substantial\nslowing down of the rapid population growth.\n\n\nAn important question to consider however, is how great was the part\nthat population planning played?\n\n\nWere there other factors that caused the GRR to decline as well?\n\n\nThe answer to the questions above, is that though population planning\nwas one very important factor, there have been several other factors that\nhave also helped in curbing the rapid population growth.\n\n\nThe most important factor after population planning, was that of\nrapid socio-economic development.\n\n\nImprovement in education, especially that of females has led to "\nhigher female participation in the labour force" and " greater female\neconomic independence" ( Cheng 1989;p.167).\n\n\nThis has in turn resulted in late marriages, delayed child-bearing,\nthe desire for fewer children, and even resulted in some women remaining\nsingle.\n\n\nUrbanization, and improvement in the levels of income and standards\nof living as a result of it, have also caused expectations to rise.\n\n\nPeople thus prefer to have less children so that they can provide\ntheir children with more luxuries.\n\n\nInstead of quantity, quality became the important consideration.\n\n\nThe value of children hence had changed from the traditional ideas of\nchildren as assets, to that of children as liabilities.\n\n\nOne important implication of the anti-natalist policy in the 1960s to\nthe early 1980s, was the fact that coupled with the socio-economic\ndevelopment, it had caused the population growth rate to recede too rapidly.\n\n\nThere was therefore danger of a maturing work force, a higher\ndependency ratio, and eventually, ageing of the population.\n\n\nThe " Great Marriage Debate" ( see Chart 1 on page 2) was sparked off\nin 1983 by the former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew.\n\n\nHe brought it up as he had noticed that the graduates who marry\nanother graduate tend to have less children or no children at all.\n\n\nThe gist of it was that the better-educated should be encouraged to\nhave more children, in view of their having less babies ( see Table 2), as\nwhat Singapore needs is not only more babies, but also more intelligent\nbabies.\n\n\nTable 2: Married Females by Highest Qualification and number of\nchildren born alive, 1980.\n\n\nSource: Cheng 1989;p.169.\n\n\nThis was assuming that intelligent parents would produce intelligent\nbabies.\n\n\nA more important problem that was noticed was the trend of unmarried\nfemales with a tertiary or upper secondary education.\n\n\nAccording to Appendix I, it was estimated that only 5% of males with\na tertiary education are single, for the females, as many as 41% are single.\n\n\nIn contrast, the number of single males in the category " no\nqualifications", was 38%, whereas for females in this category, the\npercentage was only a mere 3%.\n\n\nThe problem could be attributed to the traditional practise for men\nto \'marry down\'.\n\n\nThe reasons for the introduction of the " selective pro-natalist\npolicy" are hence more complicated than for the previous policy.\n\n\nThe " Great Marriage Debate" resulted in much controversy and so, "\nbetter-educated" was changed to " those who can afford it".\n\n\nThis was on the rationale that usually, the better-educated would be\namong those who could afford having three or more children; and that even if\nthe parents were not very well-educated, as long as they were well-off, they\nwould likewise understand the importance of a tertiary education and be able\nto support their children through it.\n\n\nIn 1986, the slogan " At least two.\n\n\nBetter three.\n\n\nFour if you can afford it" ( Cheng 1989;p.171) was introduced.\n\n\nThe SFPPB was also done away with, and a Population Planning Unit was\nformed " to promote fertility" ( Cheng 1989;p.171) in the same year.\n\n\nPreviously strict immigration and citizenship laws, were also relaxed\nto allow selective immigration of professionals and entrepreneurs, so as to\nincrease the " talent pool" ( Cheng 1989;p.171).\n\n\nWith the " three-child family" ( Chart 1, p.2) policy, incentives and\ndisincentives were also introduced.\n\n\nSome of them, included a\n&dollar;10,000 sterilization incentive to discourage poorer people from having more\nthan one or two children; a\n&dollar;20,000 tax rebate; government subsidies " for the use of child-care\ncentres"; priority in school registration for three-child families, and also\nfor bigger HDB ( Housing Development Board) flats after the birth of the\nthird child.\n\n\nThere was also the formation of the Social Development Unit ( SDU) in\nan effort to create opportunities for graduates to interact.\n\n\nA similar unit, the Social Development Section ( SDS) was set up "\nfor secondary school leavers with certain qualifications" ( Cheng\n1989;p.170).\n\n\nOne result of the above policies, was that higher educated women\nbegan to have more children.\n\n\nAccording to the Business Times ( 17 March, 1989), in 1989, the group\nof women had 7% more babies than in 1988.\n\n\nMore graduate men also took brides of equal qualifications ( The\nStraits Times 28 July, 1991).\n\n\nAs seen in Table 1 above, the rate of natural growth had increased\nfrom a low of 10.9 per thousand in 1983 to 14.8 in 1988 and back to 12.5 in\n1989.\n\n\nFor the three main ethnic groups in Singapore, there are differences\ntoo. \n\n\nTable 3: Total Fertility Rates by ethnic groups, 1960 to 1986.\n\n\nSource: Cheung 1989;p.37 \n\n\nIn Table 3, we see that the Total Fertility Rate ( TFR) for the\nIndians have gone down from 7.37 in 1960 to 1.89 in 1986;\n\n\nfor the Malays, it was 6.42 in 1960 as compared to 2.05 in 1986; the\nChinese had the lowest rate of the three for 1960 when it was 5.62, and once\nagain in 1986 when it was 1.26.\n\n\nAs the Chinese make up the majority of Singapore\'s population,\nchanges in their trends would affect the rates for the nation as a whole.\n\n\nHence, the TFR for the total population was 5.77 in 1960 and 1.44 in\n1986 ( see Table 4).\n\n\nTherefore, in 1988, the increase in the rate of natural increase, may\nhave been a result of the fact that that was the dragon year on the Chinese\ncalendar.\n\n\nThe TFR for that year was 1.98.\n\n\nThis is contrasted with 1986 which was considered the inauspicious\nyear of the ferocious white tiger.\n\n\nThe TFR then was 1.44.\n\n\nHence, the increase for the years after the " three-child" policy may\nhave been attributed more to the result of this belief in the Chinese zodiac,\nthan a result of the success of the policy. \n\n\nTable 4: The Total fertility Rate, 1960 to 1990. Source: Cheung\n1989;p.37. \n\n\nAnother point that supports this , is that habits are hard to change,\nand the desire for social mobility is especially great in the competitive\natmosphere of Singapore.\n\n\nIt may thus take longer to increase growth rates as this is going\nagainst the natural desire of man.\n\n\nThe population policy has of course had some degree of success, but\nthe results do not seem as striking as in the period of the anti-natalist\npolicy.\n\n\nWe therefore see in the success of the pre-1986 period, that\npopulation planning was but one of two main factors that resulted in the\nreduction of the growth rates.\n\n\nIn contrast, the success of the post-1987 period ( which has yet to\nend), will have to depend more, on how fervently the government can promote\nthe " three-child" policy. \n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Explain the factors accounting for the differential ethnic\npopulation growth in Peninsular Malaysia since independence.\n\n\nThe population growth rates of the three principle races -- the\nMalays, Chinese and Indians -- in Peninsular Malaysia are very different as\na result of the numerous factors affecting each one of them.\n\n\nGenerally, the population growth since independence in 1957 has\ndeclined steadily.\n\n\nWhen we say population growth, we normally refer to the components of\nmortality, fertility and migration.\n\n\nHowever, since independence, the effect of migration on the\npopulation was almost negligible.\n\n\nThe population growth of Peninsular Malaysia after 1957 thus " began\nto depend largely on natural increase" ( Saw, 1988;p.55).\n\n\nThere are two things to consider when looking at natural increase;\nthe mortality and the fertility rates.\n\n\nThe factors which affect mortality and fertility are different for\nthe different ethnic groups and they are what we shall focus on when\nexplaining the factors which account for the differential ethnic population\ngrowth since 1957.\n\n\nIn this essay, we shall first look at the overall population growth\nfor each of the ethnic groups.\n\n\nThen, we will proceed to the factors affecting the differential\nethnic population growth.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the population growth after 1957 generally\ndeclined.\n\n\nThis is true of almost all three ethnic groups.\n\n\nThere are however some fluctuations. \n\n\nAs seen in Table 1, the Malay annual growth rate increased from\n2.6% in 1957 to 3.1% in 1970 but fell again in 1984 to 3.0%.\n\n\nThe Chinese experienced a slight increase from 2.2% in 1957 to 2.3%\nin 1970.\n\n\nIt fell again to 2.0% in 1984.\n\n\nThe Indians did not experience any increase at all and their annual\ngrowth rate fell steadily from 2.7% in 1957 to 2.2% in 1984.\n\n\nFor the two latter ethnic groups, their growth rates showed a drop\nfrom the 1957 rates to the 1984 rates.\n\n\nFor the Malays however, there is a slight increase, which according\nto Saw was due to the some new Malay immigrants from the neighbouring\ncountries ( 1988;p.56. Table 1 Annual Growth Rates for Three Main Races Year\n1957 1970 1980 1984 Percentage ( %) Malays 2.6 3.1 3.0 3.0 Chinese 2.2 2.3\n2.1 2.0 Indians 2.7 2.3 2.3 2.3 Source: Saw ( 1988), p.54. \n\n\nMortality in Peninsular Malaysia has declined quite rapidly since\npre-independence years, from a crude death rate ( CDR) of 22.0 in 1934-36 to\n11.7 in 1955-57 ( Saw, 1988;p.122).\n\n\nThe CDR continued to decline after independence from 15.8 in 1950 to\n5.6 in 1984 ( Tan, 1987;p.6).\n\n\nGenerally, the decline in the mortality of the population was due to\nthe improvement of health facilities, medical care and hygiene standards.\n\n\nThere was a shift of focus from the urban areas to rural areas and\nestates as well.\n\n\nOther factors such as increased literacy, etc.\n\n\nalso contributed greatly to bringing the mortality down.\n\n\nAmong the three races, there were interesting differences to note.\n\n\nWith reference to Table 2, the CDR for the Chinese declined from\n12.7 in 1950 steadily to 5.5 in 1984, the difference being 7.2.\n\n\nFor the Indians, there was a decline too, though for them, it was\nslightly less than for the Chinese.\n\n\nThe reason for this was that during this period, there were still\nIndians being employed on the estates.\n\n\nSince the medical care of the estates came under the companies to\nwhich the estates belonged, it was commonly neglected.\n\n\nAs such, it accounted for the slightly smaller difference ( it was a\ndifference of 6.3) in the CDR of the period 1950 to 1984.\n\n\nThe Malays experienced the greatest decline in their CDR, from 18.7\nin 1950 to 5.3 in 1984, with a difference of 13.4.\n\n\nThe reasons for this are twofold.\n\n\nFirstly, the Malays had a higher mortality at the beginning of the\nperiod, their decline was therefore substantially more.\n\n\nThis is contrasted to the Chinese whose mortality rates have always\nbeen relatively lower.\n\n\nSecondly, the Malays were also greatly affected by the "\nGovernment\'s effort to raise their living standard under the new Economic\nPolicy" ( Tan, 1987;p.9).\n\n\nWith the implementation of the policy, the government hoped to\nimprove the Malays\' standard of living and quality of life, so that they\nwould be better equipped to compete with the other two races.\n\n\nOne of the effects of the policy was thus the lowering of the CDR .\n\n\n\nTable 2 Crude Death Rates in Peninsular Malaysia Year Malays\nChinese Indians 1950 18.7 12.7 13.6 1960 11.2 7.8 9.0 1970 7.6 6.6 8.5 1980\n5.5 5.8 7.6 1984 5 3 5 5 7 3 Source: Tan ( 1987), p.6. \n\n\nThe same information is also gathered from the computation of the\nstandardised death rates which provide more accuracy as to the mortality\ntrends of the three ethnic groups.\n\n\nAccording to Saw, the reduction of mortality for the Malays was\n75.9% during 1916-81; as compared to 61.4% and 56.1% for the Chinese and\nIndians respectively, during the same period ( 1988;p.131).\n\n\nAnother index that is more accurate than the CDR is the infant\nmortality rate.\n\n\nThe reason for this lies in the fact that a great portion of the\ntotal mortality rates in the past was the result of infant mortality which\nwas high.\n\n\nAccording to Saw, the infant mortality rates of all the three races\ndeclined.\n\n\nIn 1946-48, the infant mortality rates of the Chinese was 44% lower\nthan the Malays ( Saw,1988;p.137).\n\n\nThe infant mortality rates of the Indians were also lower than that\nof the Malays, by 22% ( Saw,1988;p.137).\n\n\nHowever, in recent years, such as the period 1979-81, the infant\nmortality rates of all the three races are pretty low, with the lowest being\nthe Chinese at 16.9, followed by the Malays at 27.0 and finally the Indians\nat 27.7 ( Saw, 1988;p.136).\n\n\nThe infant mortality rates of the Chinese has always been relatively\nlower.\n\n\nThis is even true of the pre-independence years as many of the\nChinese population live in the urban or suburban areas and relatively more of\nthe them are educated as a result.\n\n\nThe Malays on the other hand reside predominantly in the rural\nareas, where medical care, sanitation, hygiene and other basic services were\nnot well developed at that time.\n\n\nThese, in addition to the poor nutrition and the lack of education\nresulted in a high infant immortality rate.\n\n\nThings have changed now and this is reflected in the low rate of\ninfant mortality among the Malays.\n\n\nGeneral fertility trends have declined as well since independence.\n\n\nAfter the second world war, the crude birth rates have declined with\nfew exceptions.\n\n\nIn fact, after independence from 1957 to 1987, the CBR declined by\n16.7, the overall decline being from 46.2 in 1957 to 29.5 in 1987 ( refer to\nlecture handout).\n\n\nThe birth rates of the different races have also experienced a\ndecline, even though there are great differences in the pattern for each of\nthe different races.\n\n\nThis will be further discussed when we refer to the Gross\nReproduction Rate ( GRR) of the different ethnic groups later on.\n\n\nThe GRR for the three races display slight though not great\nfluctuations.\n\n\nThe fluctuations experienced are mainly the result of the Malays.\n\n\nThe difference of the GRR for the Malays between 1957 and 1983 went\ndown by only 0.760 as seen in the table below.\n\n\nFor the other two races, the trend is generally declining as shown\nin Table 3.\n\n\nFor the period 1917-57, the percentage annual change increased for\nthe Indians and the Malays, while the Chinese experienced a 0.4% decline (\nSaw, 1988;p.191).\n\n\nIn 1958 however, there was a decline for all the ethnic groups.\n\n\nGenerally from 1957-83, the fertility of the Malays decreased only\nby 25.7%, while the Chinese and the Indians had far greater reductions\nresulting in the fertility being reduced by 62.3% and 61.1% respectively (\nSaw, 1988;p.192). \n\n\nTable 3 Gross Reproduction Rates for Three Main Races, 1957 & 1983\nYear 1957 1983 Diff. Malay 2.961 2.201 0.760 Chinese 3.486 1.313 2.173\nIndians 3 765 1 461 2 301 Source: Saw ( 1988), p.\n\n\n199. \n\n\nNow, we move on to the factors accounting for these differences\namong the races.\n\n\nFactors that explained the lower reduction of fertility for the\nMalays are firstly, that being basically rural, the postponement of\nchildbearing to the later years brought about by family planning, is not\ncoupled with having less children.\n\n\nThe tightening of rules regarding divorce for the Malays who are\nmostly Muslims is another factor.\n\n\nDivorce used to be very easy for the Muslims and this would mean\nthat the couple do not stay together long enough to have many children.\n\n\nStricter rules hence would mean that now, the couple stay together\nfor a longer time which may lead to an increase in birth rates.\n\n\nFinally, only 4.1% of Malay women aged 25-34 were using\ncontraceptives in 1966-67 ( Saw, 1988;p.192).\n\n\nThis would then, definitely lead to a higher fertility rate among\nMalays as a result of no proper practice of family planning.\n\n\nThe Chinese on the other hand experienced an earlier decline in\nfertility.\n\n\nThis, in itself made the decline from 1957 onwards more rapid.\n\n\nThe Chinese started practising contraception way before the family\nplanning programme was implemented in 1966-67.\n\n\nThe fact that the minimum age for marriage of Chinese women had\nrisen to 22.05 years in 1957 was another important consideration, as it was\nalmost four years higher than that of the Malay or Indian women ( Saw,\n1988;p.200).\n\n\nFour years, could mean another one to three babies.\n\n\nThe Indians\' almost equally rapidly declining fertility rate was\nattributed to the special family planning services provided in the estates.\n\n\nIt is also important to notice that though the Indians\' fertility\nrates are slightly higher than the Chinese, their decline in GRR from 1957 to\n1983 was the greatest among the three races, at 2.301 ( refer to Table 3,\np.5.\n\n\nabove).\n\n\nThis could be attributed to the fact that the GRR for the Indians,\nfor the year 1957, was very much greater than for the Chinese.\n\n\nThe decline is therefore more.\n\n\nBesides, the younger age at marriage for the females and the higher\nproportion of married women as compared to the Chinese, also explain the\nslightly higher fertility rates.\n\n\nThe above factors brought up for supporting and explaining the\ndifferential ethnic population growth are by no means exhaustive, the list\ngoes on.\n\n\nHowever, here, due to several constraints, I have just brought up a\nfew of the more major and interesting factors. \n\n\nBibliographies:- 1.

{'text': 'Q: Describe and evaluate the role(s) that Japan has played in the\npostwar international political economy.\n\n\nA: Japan\'s international role is commanding increasing attention among\nscholars and diplomats.\n\n\nThat Japan has to play a more comprehensive role is widely\nacknowledged in the international community and increasingly in Japan as\nwell.\n\n\nBut unlike the U.S., a country which uses military forces and economic\npower as tools to achieve her goals, Japan is only confined to the latter\ntool.\n\n\nLimitations imposed by its constitutions, a deep aversion in its body\npolitics to militarism, and a sensitivity to the concerns expressed by the\nAsians have prevented Japan from developing an international military role.\n\n\nThere are leaders like Mr Lee Kuan Yew who believed that in due course\nJapan will develop a military capability commensurate with its economic power\nand that it can play a positive security role in South-East Asian.\n\n\nBy and large, however, the perception is that Japan can best\ncontribute the region\'s peace and security by assisting in the economic\ndevelopment of its countries.\n\n\nAnd that is exactly how Japan uses her economic might to play a role\nin the postwar international political economy.\n\n\nThe reactive approach to international developments, which has been\nthe nature of Japanese foreign policy is no longer adequate.\n\n\nIt is also not befitting a country that has the potential to shape\nthe course of international developments.\n\n\nThe Japanese are also proud of their hard-earned success and there is\na growing desire to gain international recognition and respect which they\nconsider should accompany such success.\n\n\nThus, ensuring a smooth transition from the role of international\nbeneficiary to that of international benefactor is a major challenge to Japan\nand to the international community.\n\n\nJapan\'s economy has grown by leaps and bounds.\n\n\nHer economic miracle has transformed it into a powerful economic\njuggernaut in this new Asia-Pacific era.\n\n\nConcurrent with this impressive economic growth, Japan\'s economic\ninterests have become global in nature.\n\n\nHer direct investment has spread throughout the world.\n\n\nAs Japan is expected to continued to be a capital surplus country for\nthe foreseeable future, its global direct foreign investment is also likely\nto continue, with the pattern adjustment to the needs of the time.\n\n\nFor example, the flow of the foreign investment since 1984 has been\nguided by the need to secure markets previously acquired through exports and\nto avoid protectionism, in contrast to the earlier emphasis on investment in\ndeveloping countries to exploit cheap labour and to support export promotion.\n\n\nIn addition to the economic goal, the economic tools are also used to\nachieve international respect.\n\n\nIn 1984 the foreign minister, Shintaro Abe, advanced a proposal which\noutlined a role for Japan in a future Cambodia settlement.\n\n\nJapan would underwrite the peace keeping expenses in Cambodia,\nprovide personnel and facilities to help in the supervision of an election to\nbe held under international supervision, and provide economic assistance to\nthe Indochina countries following a settlement.\n\n\nNow that the Cambodia conflict actually appears to be heading towards\nsome kind of settlement, Japan may be better placed to regain an initiative\nand play a more active role in the promotion of peace and stability in the\nregion.\n\n\nThe relatively high profile adopted by Japan in the frenzy of\ndiplomatic authority over a settlement in Cambodia suggest that this may\nindeed be happening.\n\n\nAs Japan\'s interest lies in a stable and open international political\nand economic order, she has to make a significant contribution to the\npreservation and enhancement of stability and order in the international\nsystem if only to safeguard its medium- and long-term property and security.\n\n\nThe relocation of Japanese industries in other countries and\ninternationalization of the yen will further globalize Japan\'s economy, thus\nincreasing its stake in a stable and predictable international system.\n\n\nThese policies bear fruits when there is a marked changed in the\nattitude of the world towards Japan.\n\n\nThe ASEAN for example, previously viewed Japan as an economic animal,\nbut today the economic success of Japan is viewed with admiration and as\nemulation.\n\n\nThe Malaysia\'s \'look east\' policy, Singapore\'s \'learn from Japan\npolicy\' and the many plans formulated in nearly all the ASEAN capitals to\ntake advantage of Japan\'s \'expansionary\' phase reflect these changes.\n\n\nHowever the strong economic growth of Japan have caused the\ndislocation of many industries in other countries.\n\n\nFor example, between the 70\'sand 80\'s, Japanese automobiles like\nHonda, Toyota and Nissan captured the market share of every other American\nand German models.\n\n\nAnd the Japanese Casio and Seiko digital watches have taken a\nsignificant market share from the traditional Swiss Watch-makers.\n\n\nThe Japanese brands of consumer electronics and appliances have also\ngained increasing popularity worldwide.\n\n\nThis type of dislocation caused much unemployment in the affected\ncountries which could not compete as well as the Japanese.\n\n\nJapan was thus instrumental in creating disruption and instability in\nthese economies.\n\n\nAlthough Japan has acted to these many grievances, the general view\nin the world is that Japan responses are frequently \'too late and too\nlittle\'.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Japan\'s tremendous growth in her economy is achieved\nby the losses of other countries.\n\n\nThus, many countries are trying to emulate her economic success, and\nJapan is using her economic might to protect herself.\n\n\nThe strongest and most acceptable assets for Japan continue to be her\neconomic and technological resources.\n\n\nIn the world of today the political dimension of economic relations\nis assuming centre-stage.\n\n\nJapan with its huge surplus in capital, a large market and advanced\ntechnological capabilities is uniquely placed to play a major role in\npromoting a stable international system and to assist in the economic\ndevelopment of Third World countries.\n\n\nThese may be the most significant and invaluable international\npolitical roles for Japan in the decade to come. \n\n\n\n\nDiscuss Gulliver\'s Travels as a narrative of journey and\ndisillusionment.\n\n\nGulliver\'s Travels, comprising four voyages, employs the conventions\nof travel literature.\n\n\nThe title it was first published as - Travels Into Several Remote\nNations of the World - points to a narrative that involves a journey of some\nsort.\n\n\nGulliver himself declares that he had indeed recounted " a faithful\nHistory of [ his] Travels for sixteen years".\n\n\nThis statement is supported by a narrative that is peppered with\nmeticulous details of each voyage - including navigational jargon like\nlongitudes and latitudes as well as extensive nautical descriptions of\nprevailing wind conditions.\n\n\nBut of course, Gulliver\'s Travels is more than a few samples of a\ntraveller\'s tales randomly strung together.\n\n\nThe four voyages - though they can be read as discrete narratives -\nare carefully plotted as part of a larger journey.\n\n\nSwift also fuses the well-known conventions of utopian fiction,\nimaginary voyage and autobiography into his work.\n\n\nSwift uses a combination of these conventions, often subverting them,\nto facilitate his satiric attack and to convey the great sense of\ndisillusionment found in the tales.\n\n\nIn the first place the narrative of journey in Gulliver\'s Travels\ndoes not read like a pure travelogue where the reader actually becomes the\ntraveller.\n\n\nNowhere is the reader expected to be a mere tourist taking in the\nsights and sounds of an exotic land.\n\n\nRather, it is obvious that we, as informed readers, are to evaluate\nthis fantastical journey as well as to appreciate the parallels between the\nvisited lands and the world we know.\n\n\nWe could also read Gulliver\'s journey on a metaphorical level as a\nquest or search for meaning.\n\n\nThe going out and returning found in the narrative imply a centre\nthat is not only geographical but also personal.\n\n\nThis is in line with the autobiographical nature of the Gulliver\'s\nTales as seen by the first person narrative and the reader\'s distinct sense\nof this narrator\'s presence.\n\n\nBy using an autobiographical mode and by setting up Gulliver as a\nhonest and compassionate character we are more likely to identify with the\nnarrator and take what he reports as reliable.\n\n\nGulliver\'s observation become all the more necessary when the\nsituations that are recounted are often outside our own human experience.\n\n\nIt is through the voice of this apparently reliable traveller that\nSwift\'s disillusionment with society is articulated.\n\n\nSometimes Guiliver does this by comparing what is good and desirable\nin the " Remote Nations" with what is imperfect and corrupt in his own\ncivilisation.\n\n\nIndeed there are institutions and value systems in these other\nsocieties that warrant emulation.\n\n\nThe disillusionment then is effected by our awareness of what is\nlacking in Swift\'s society.\n\n\nFor example the government in Brobdingnag, led by the wise and\nprudent king, is one that does not separate morality from its policies.\n\n\nHere Swift puts his own English government on trial, suggesting that\nit is a non-moral entity interested only in its own survival and well-being.\n\n\nThe Brobdingnagian kingdom is also one with a practical ethos: unlike\nEngland, a productive farmer here is valued more than the " whole Race of\nPoliticians put together".\n\n\nLater, when the horrified king rejects Gulliver\'s offer of gunpowder,\nSwift is making a criticism on Man\'s obsession with firearms and the ability\nto destroy each other.\n\n\nHowever, Swift never allows us to see the kingdom of Brobdingnag or\nany other kingdom as an utopian model.\n\n\nWe are constantly reminded that the kingdoms of the first three\nvoyages still belong to the domain of the human - and tainted as we are by\nour imperfect nature, there is no remote possibility that these can be seen\nas ideals ( Thus our disillusionment becomes double fold).\n\n\nThe Lilliputians, for all their puny stature and apparently harmless\nantics turn out to be a politically manipulative people incapable of\ngratitude.\n\n\nThey are more concerned with annexing Blefuscu than showing\nappreciation to Gulliver for his " extraordinary stratagem" that prevents an\ninvasion; they are more concerned with propriety rather than with the fact\nthat the palace fire had been extinguished.\n\n\nThe government itself seems to be more preoccupied with internal\nconflicts ( for example, between the Trameckan and Slamecksan, or between the\nBig-Endians and Small-Endians) than with improving the lives of the people.\n\n\nIn fact, Lilliput does not seem to enjoy much political stability.\n\n\nReldresal, the Principal Secretary laments that they " labour under\ntwo mighty Evils; a violent faction at home and the Danger of Invasion by a\nmost potent Enemy from abroad" and even Gulliver notes that what was good in\ntheir nation has fallen of late into " scandalous Corruptions".\n\n\nEven in Brobdingnag, which Gulliver considers to be " the least\ncorrupted" there are such morally repulsive characters as Gulliver\'s first\nmaster.\n\n\nDriven by material gains he exploits Gulliver to the state of " a\nnear skeleton".\n\n\nAnd even though Gulliver acknowledges the Brobdingnagian king as an\nexcellent ruler, he is nonetheless perceived as lacking in the art of\ngovernment and the learning of his people is seen as " very defective".\n\n\nThe loss of this utopian possibility and our subsequent\ndisenchantment is compounded when we are forced to confront our human nature.\n\n\nThroughout Gulliver\'s Travels, we are constantly reminded of the\nimperfections and vices of Man, whether it is the petty meanness of the\nLilliputians, the physical grotesqueness of the Brobdinnagians or the obtuse\nself-delusion of the projectors in Lagado.\n\n\nIn a sense, the emergence of the savage Yahoos represents the\nculmination of a denaturing process that has been taking place through the\nvoyages.\n\n\nHowever episodic and disjointed Gulliver\'s Travels may seem, one can\nsee the Yahoo - stripped of the vestige of reason that he only abuses - as an\namalgam of all the undesirable human traits encountered in the earlier\nvoyages.\n\n\nBy the time we reach the final voyage, the previously visited ( and\nessentially human) kingdoms have been rejected as models for emulation.\n\n\nWhat is being put forth as an alternative now is the coldly rational\n- and non-human - world of the Houyhnhnms.\n\n\nIf we were indeed to see Gulliver\'s Travels as a journey of\nself-discovery and a search for self-knowledge, then this final voyage as\nwell as what utopia it proposes, must hold even greater significance.\n\n\nHow does Gulliver come to terms with his being?\n\n\nThe answer is that he chooses to " purge" himself of all the "\ncorruptions of [ his] Yahoo nature". \n\n\nYet despite his claims that the Houyhnhnms are the definitive model\nfor the " imitation of Mankind," we know that we cannot take Gulliver\'s final\nexhortations as the Gospel truth.\n\n\nFar from it.\n\n\nIndeed we are highly suspicious that Gulliver - by now a virulent\nmisanthrope who even rejects his wife - has any opinion that is trustworthy\nor of any " Publick Good".\n\n\nOur disillusionment then, extends beyond a dissatisfaction with\nsociety; it includes the loss of our hitherto reliable narrator.\n\n\nAs it already stands, Voyage IV has represented Man as " cunning,\nmalicious, treacherous and revengeful" Yahoos, as " the most unteachable of\nall animals" as well as avaricious creatures with insatiable appetites for "\nshining stones" that have no practical value.\n\n\nWhile this behaviour is deplorable, yet we cannot condone how\nGulliver embraces his non-human master\'s culture.\n\n\nHe distances himself from his own species and his desire to mimic\nthe Houyhnhnms only results in absurdity: his voice becomes like the "\nNeighing of a Horse" and he even takes pride when told that his gait is like\na horse\'s gallop!\n\n\nBy allowing Gulliver to degenerate into a proud man who aligns\nhimself with the non-human Houyhnhnms, Swift is making a harsh satiric attack\non human nature.\n\n\nThe narrator who tried to convey a moral message for the public good\nhas become blinkered and tainted with the vices he sought to expunge.\n\n\nIn this process, Swift subverts the journey at a metaphorical level\n- the search for self-knowledge is doomed to certain failure.\n\n\nIn the end, the message in Gulliver\'s Travels seems to be a fairly\npessimistic one - Swift\'s work is not only a scathing indictment of English\nsociety, it paints an ugly picture of humanity and suggests that remedy is\nimpossible.\n\n\nThus the Lilliputian\'s moral stature will remain small and the\nBrobdingnagian\'s defects magnified.\n\n\nEven human immortality embodied in the Struldbruggs, is no more than\na prolonged period of man\'s follies and vices.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the Houhnhnm model is at best suitable for its\nown species - a perfect example of animal rationale.\n\n\nAt worst it is a world where every activity is reduced to its\ninstrumental value; where even the sexual act is no more than " one of the\nnecessary acts of a reasonable being".\n\n\nThe Houyhnhnm may be the embodiment of Truth and Reason but\nultimately manifests itself in a form unacceptable to the reader.\n\n\nGulliver\'s Travels undoubtedly is a narrative about journey - it is\na physical journey that brings us to strange, exotic lands; it is also a\njourney of imagination that creates disillusionment and compels us to take a\nlong hard look at our human selves.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0a20cfd5-1352-4069-9bce-bd06f93e0750', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.625277+00:00',

{'text': "Statement of the Problem \n\n\nHow closely do editors' perceptions of readers' interest agree with\ntheir own news interest and is perceived news coverage related more to\neditors' own news intrest or more to their perceptions of readers' interest?\n\n\n Definitions of terms \n\n\nI thereby quote the definition of 'perceptions' from Petty and\nCacioppo in 'Attitudes and Persuasion' as 'something people beleive to be\ntrue, and which people often act on'.\n\n\nDegree of closeness is measured on the basis of congruency, i.e. the\nextent to which newspapers editors' interest agreed with what they thought\nwould interest their readers.\n\n\nEditors refer to those working in the daily newspapers in the United\nStates.\n\n\nNews coverage is viewed in terms of adequacy as in total story length\nin column inches.\n\n\nThe news under analysis is classified under the categories as\noutlined: government, business, sports, foreign affairs, crime,\nmilitary/defence, foreign news, human interest, law/justice, fashion/food,\narts/entertainment and politics.\n\n\nThus, to conclude, the problem is to find out 'The extent to which\nnewspapers editor' interest agreed with what they thought would interest\ntheir readers in the different news categories such as government, business,\nsports, foreign affairs, crime, military/defence, foreign news, human\ninterest, law/justice, fashion/food, arts/entertainment and politics and to\nsee how adequacy of the news covered is related the editors' own interest and\nthe readers' interest as predicted and believed to be true by the editors.\n\n\n Selecting the Topic \n\n\nThe initial research topic outline I proposed was relatively wide in\nscope - - - from newsgathering, agenda-setting of the press to the judgement\nof the importance of news by the news media, i.e. gatekeeping.\n\n\nThe reason why I chose this area of research is my deep interest in\nthe workings of the press.\n\n\nBesides, this might be of help in my future career as a journalist.\n\n\nAfter learning that chapter 13 in our Lowery and DeFleur text is\nentirely devoted to the agenda-setting function of the press, I soon thought\nit natural to narrow the focus of my proposal to this aspect of research.\n\n\nAlthough, the text provided the main source of material for my\nresearch, it was not easy, as I discovered later, to find the relevant\nliterature from the central library.\n\n\nFirstly, I did not know how to begin searching for the right\nmaterials from the wide collection of reference books available at the\nlibrary.\n\n\nI was particularly groping in the dark with no help from any of my\nfriends ( many of my friends do not take mass communication as their\nsubject).\n\n\nSecondly, I was afraid because I was left very much on my own and it\nwas horrible each time I thought that none of my tutorial mates had chosen\nthe same topic for research - - - as it meant that there would be no sharing\nof research findings and, of course, woes together.\n\n\nSomehow, the definition of 'agenda-setting' by McCombs as 'the focus\nset by the media by telling us what is important and what to think about (\nthough not necessarily what to think about)', struck me as a hint that I\nshould start searching for materials pertaining to the cognitive and\npsychological aspect of mass communication.\n\n\nAlthough, I managed to find some reference materials on this subject;\nfor example a book that I found called 'A Cognitive Psychology of Mass\nCommunication' by Richard Jackson Harris, I was still unable to relate them\nto the main topic of agenda-setting.\n\n\nI was thus forced to review chapter 13 in the text again.\n\n\nIt was then that I discovered that many of the studies done were\nfocused on both media presentation of the political issues and voter\nperceptions of the significance of those issues.\n\n\nThe Charlotte study is one fine example.\n\n\nOn top of that, there was some mention of another form of media\ncontent - - - political advertising by the candidates.\n\n\nI thought things would be running smoothly for me this time because\nthe coming general elections came in all too timely.\n\n\nBesides, this would tie in perfectly with my study of the\nagenda-setting function of the press.\n\n\nHowever, after the reports in the general election to my research, my\nefforts still did not yield any satisfactory results.\n\n\nThe final straw that led to a slight change in my research topic was\nwhen I stumbled upon a book called 'Mass Communication and Political\nInformation Processing' by Sidney Kraus.\n\n\nAn article from the book titled 'News for the Other Person: Editors'\nProcessing of Readers' Interest' by Tsan-Kuo Chang and Sidney Kraus hence\ncontributed largely to the formulation of my final research proposal.\n\n\nThe whole focus of the analysis is now shifted back to one of the\naspects of the research outline proposed earlier, i.e. gatekeeping.\n\n\nI do not regard this as a complete diversion from agenda-setting;\nrather, I would consider it as part of the process because agenda-setting is\nin itself a complex process of news selection, newsgathering and delivery.\n\n\nIn addition,it is afterall the gatekeeping function of the editors\nthat shape the content of the news and affect the levels of importance\nsuggested by the media.\n\n\nAll in all, it took me about 2 weeks to arrive at the final statement\nof the problem.\n\n\n Literature Review \n\n\nA Review of primary resources.\n\n\nThe main source of material for my research was from the book titled 'Mass\nCommunication and Political Processing' edited by Sidney Kraus.\n\n\nAn article written by Sidney Kraus et al titled 'News for the Other\nPerson: Editors' Processing of Readers' Interest' thus formed the basis of my\nresearch topic.\n\n\nThe article contains a comperhensive summary of many studies done in\nthe past, and gives an overview of these studies and their results.\n\n\nHowever, 'the purpose of this chapter is to determine how newspaper\neditors across the country perceive their readers' interest in the news1 and\nwhether the perceptions relate to perceived coverage of various news\ncategories.\n\n\nSpecifically, the following research questions were addressed: What\ndid newspapers editors think of their readers' interest in the news?\n\n\nHow closely did editors' perceptions of readers' interest agree with\ntheir own news interest?\n\n\nWhat factors affected editors' perceptions of readers news interest?\n\n\nWas perceived news coverage related more to editors' own news\ninterest or more to their perceptions of readers interest?'\n\n\n METHOD \n\n\nThe study was carried out in the form of a mail survey in which a\nnational sample of 550 daily newspapers was randomly selected from the 1987\nEditor And Publisher International Yearbook.\n\n\nHowever, the final sample was 540 newspapers after eleiminating 10\npapers which either merged or shared the same editorial staff with other\nlarger papers in the sample.\n\n\nA 6-page questionaire, composed mostly of multiple-choice questions\nwas mailed to the editor of each newspaper in mid-December 1987.\n\n\n'In the questionaire, editors were asked, among other things, to rate\ntheir readers' interest in each of the following news categories: government,\nbusiness/finance, politics, sports, U.S.\n\n\nforeign affairs, crime/violence, military/defence, foreign news,\nhuman interest, law/justice, fashion/food/living, and arts/entertainment.\n\n\nEditors indicated their readers' interests in each of the news\ncategories on a 5-point scale, with 1 representing 'not at all very\ninterested'.\n\n\nOn a similar 5-point scale, editors were asked how interested they\nwere personally in the same 12 news categories.\n\n\n'To measure coverage of the 12 news categories, editors were asked to\nrate their newspaper's overall coverage of those categories on a 5-point\nscale, with 1 representing 'not at all adequate' and 5 representing 'very\nadequate.'\n\n\nThe perceived adequacy of coverage by editors may serve as indicators\nof how the 12 news categories were covered in the editors' newspapers.'\n\n\nMeasures used in the study included newspaper circulation, region,\neditors' political leanings, party affiliation, education, presence of\ncompeting newspapers, and editor's years of working experience.\n\n\n RESULTS \n\n\nThere is incongruency between editors' own interest and the perceived\nreaders' interest.\n\n\nThis can be best seen in the overall rankings of the 12 categories in\nTable 7.2.\n\n\nOn the whole, editors considered themselves to be more interested in\nthe following news categories: government, politics, business, foreign\naffairs, military/defence, foreign news, and law/justice.\n\n\nOn the other hand, they perceived their readers to be interested than\nthey were in sports, crime, human interest, fashion/food/living, and\narts/entertainment.\n\n\nAs is evident, the differences between editors' own interest and the\nperceived readers' interest seem to follow a conventionalclassification of\nnews: hard news versus soft news.\n\n\nEditors rated their own interest to be high in hard news and\nperceived their readers to be mostly interested in soft news.\n\n\nResults of the coverage of the 12 news categories in the newspapers\nare reported in Table 7.3.\n\n\nThe results show that there appears to be no relationship between\neditors' interest in the news and the ratings of their newspapers' overall\ncoverage of news.\n\n\nInstead, it appears that perceived readers' news interest is related\nto the overall amount of coverage rated by the editors.\n\n\nThis finding implies that editors gave what their readers asked for\n2.\n\n\nTable 7.2.\n\n\nTable 7.3.\n\n\nThe next source of material is an article 'Opinion Agreement and\nAccuracy Between Editors and their Readers' from Journalism Quarterly, 49 by\nMartin et al.\n\n\n( 1972).\n\n\nThey Provided evidence suggesting that editors perceived readers'\ninterest fairly well and the perceptions influenced their news decision\nmaking.\n\n\nMoreover, individual opinions of editors were found to affect choice\nof stories.\n\n\nThe study, based on a co-orientation model, explored a number of\nquestions.\n\n\nThe questions posed were centred around a selected controversial news\nevent and were basically interested in finding out whether the positions held\nby the public as perceived by the daily newspaper editors are accurate with\nrespect to that news event.\n\n\nIn addition, they also wanted to find out 'whether the stated\npositions of daily newspaper editors concerning a controversial news event\nhave any pattern consistent with the emphasis in the treatment editors gave\nto news stories of the event.'\n\n\nThe news event selected was about a campus demonstration staged by\nblack students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1969.\n\n\nAn analysis of headline content was made to see the revealing\npatterns of editor attitude.\n\n\nControl measures included the selection of a panel of judges from\ndiverse backgrounds.\n\n\nThe data revealed the belief on the part of the judges that a strong\nmajority of the headlines about the event were neutral.\n\n\nThe results also showed that the pattern of responses regarding the\nopinion questions was quite similar between editors and readers.\n\n\nOn top of that, 'there is no consistent pattern regarding the\neditors' stated positions and the amount of attention given to news stories\nof the event.\n\n\nHowever, there appears to be a discernible association between the\nWisconsin editors' perception of their readers' beliefs and the direction of\nthe stories that appeared in their newspapers.'\n\n\nTherefore, we see from this study, that editors do perceive their\nreaders' interest and that perceived news coverage is related more to the\nperceived readers' interest.\n\n\nHence, this is in agreement with the results of the first work, that\nis, editors gave what their readers asked for.\n\n\nThe third work is an article titled 'Influence of Editors, Readers,\nand Personal Opinions on Reporters' taken from Journalism Quarterly, 48 by\nFlegel et al.\n\n\n( 1971).\n\n\nThe study focuses mainly on the gatekeeping functions of reporters\nand 'attempted to assess the influences that guide news selection by\nreporters.\n\n\nThe 3 external factors are: the reporters' own opinion, his\nperception of his editor's opinions, and his perception of his readers'\nopinions.\n\n\n2 daily newpapers of Madison, Wisconsin were selected for the study,\nnamely the more conservative Wisconsin State Journal ( WSJ) and the liberal\npaper, Capital Times ( CT).\n\n\nResults show that reporters tended to cover news according to their\nown opinions and the perceptions of readers' views were less influential in\ntheir reporting.\n\n\nMoreover, for both daily newspapers, it was found that for both news\nand feature stories, the order of influence described by the reporters was\nthe same:\n\n\n'they feel that their own opinions guide their reporting more than do\nthose of their editors; readers' opinions are even less important.'

A dissection of the Consonant Interface \n\n\nThe present interface is a highly simplified version of a prototype\ninterface.\n\n\nFor ease of comparison, the flow-charts of both interfaces are\nreproduced below.\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the flow-chart of a prototypic NL-interface, while\nFigure 2 shows the flow-chart of the Consonant Interface.\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nThe three main simplifications seen in the Consonant Interface are (\ni) the merging of the parser with the linguistic component, ( ii) the lack of\na domain component, and ( iii)the reduction of the generator to a simple\ndisplayer.\n\n\nWe will look at each of these parts in detail.\n\n\n 2.1 The linguistic component \n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the linguistic component is merged with the\nparser in the present system.\n\n\nWhile this is not exactly a fault, it might be cleaner to encode the\nlinguistic knowledge and the domain knowledge used be the parser in two\nseparate components apart for the parser.\n\n\nThis is because, strictly speaking, the parser is an intermediary\ncomponent which translates a NL input into a fomula in a formal language, and\nwhatever linguistic or domain knowledge it utilises is not part of itself.\n\n\nAlso, if we include a generator which utilises the same linguistic\nand domain knowledge, it would be very strange indeed to see the generator\nconsulting the parser for such knowledge!\n\n\nA more important concern is what is in the linguistic component.\n\n\nThe linguistic component consists of a grammar and a lexicon.\n\n\nThe choice of grammar used is crucial to the ability of the\ninterface.\n\n\nNote that the word \'interface\' has been used instead of \'parser\'.\n\n\nThis is because the generator ( which we would like to have in our\nnew, improved interface) also makes use of the linguistic component, and " in\na dialog system, it could be logical to select a reversible grammar for both\nanalysis and generation" ( Mitkov: 1991,308).\n\n\n 2.1.1 The present grammar used \n\n\nAt present, the grammar used is a phrase structure ( PS) one, and\nwhen the parser is activated, the input goes through " conventional syntactic\nparsing from surface sentences to hierarchical ( tree-like) constituents" (\nWilks:1983,219).\n\n\nThe parsing process is based purely on syntax and nothing else.\n\n\nWhile this may work perfectly in checking the syntactic\nwell-formedness of an input sentence, it reflects the fact that the\nlinguistic theory on which it is based relies on a non-semantic approach to\nlinguistic study ( Course notes, 119).\n\n\nThis is a problem discussed quite in detail in Wilks ( 1983), where\nhe examines the distinctions between superficial and deep parsing.\n\n\nIt is important to note that from the onset, Wilks considers that "\ndeep-surface opposition has nothing essentially to do with the opposition of\nsyntax to semantics" ( Wilks:1983,220).\n\n\nThis means that it would be too simplistic, and even wrong, to\nconsider a parser as superficial or deep just by looking at whether it is\nbased on syntax or semantics.\n\n\nIn fact, if our interface is to model natural languages and the way\nthe human mind analyses ( parses) and generates sentences, it would require\nboth semantics as well as syntax.\n\n\nThe point to note is that many linguists ( and the number is growing)\nbelieve that in analysing or generating sentences, the human brain looks\nfirst at what is being ( or is to be) communicated rather than how it is\nbeing ( or is to be) communicated.\n\n\nHence, " the purpose of grammars is not to give rules which associate\nPS-structures with sentences but, rather, rules which explain how to\nassociate a syntactic structure with a semantic structure" ( Course notes,\n119).\n\n\nBefore we look into the deep-superficial system opposition, Let us\nlook at an alternative \'superficial\' parsing method using a more\nsemantics-based grammar - dependency grammar.\n\n\n 2.1.2 Dependency grammars: an alternative to PS-approaches \n\n\nIn a dependency grammar ( DG), the syntactic structure of a\nlinguistic utterance is not based on rules as in PS-grammars.\n\n\nInstead, the syntactic structure is a system of Links between words.\n\n\nThese links, called syntactic dependencies, are very similar to the\ngrammatical functions in traditional grammar.\n\n\nWhat is important to note is that these dependencies are not based on\nrules of syntax but on the meaning of the words and the knowledge of how\ntheir relationship to each other.\n\n\nHence, " this type of approach does not only make it easier to\nConnect syntax with semantics, IT AIMS AT ESTABLISHING SUCH CONNECTIONS" (\nCourse notes,123).\n\n\n 2.1.3 The deep-superficial parsing opposition \n\n\nThe dependency grammar talked about in the previous section was\ndescribed as \'superficial\' because, according to Wilks\' criteria of\nsuperficiality, a parser using a DG would have in its output items that are\nthose of the surface language ( input) analysed.\n\n\nFor example, an input sentence like " The girl likes the blond-haired\nboy", when parsed, would become:\ns(LIKE:[v,sing],[\'Subject\',GIRL:[cn,sing],[\'Determiner\',\nTHE:[art],\'Qualifier\',...:[],[\'Direct Object\', Boy:[cn,sing], \'Determiner\',The:[art],\'Qualifier\',BLOND-HAIRED:[adj]),\nand the lexemes LIKE, GIRL, THE etc are essentially the same words/items\nfound in the input sentence, unlike, for example, the semantic representation\nof \'girl\' as [ Female, Young], or something like that.\n\n\nThe tendency for one to think that a deep system is superior to a\nsuperficial one is perhaps an unfortunate one perpetuated by the connotations\nof the words deep and superficial themselves.\n\n\nWhile there are systems that are completely superficial ( as the\nPS-parser in the Consonant Interface has proven), the existence of a\ncompletely deep system lies more in theory than in practice, if Wilks\'\ncriteria for superficiality are to be observed.\n\n\nIn his discussion of deep parsers, Wilks says of Riesbeck\'s 1975\nparser ( \'A paradigm deep system\') that " the system is highly\nsuperficial...it is verbs that seek prepositions...rather than basic actions\nseeking cases.\n\n\nThis surface method naturally makes it hard to state \'significant\nsemantic generalizations\', and is particularly odd in a parser that claims to\nbe based on Schank who abhorred all processing based on surface correlations"\n( Wilks:1983,228).\n\n\nOf his own deep system, Wilks comments that " the process of matching\nsuch structures onto input text begins with fragmentation, a purely\nsuperficial process..." ( Wilks:1983,232).\n\n\nHe then goes on to talk about the system PHRAN by Wilensky and Arens\n1908, and says " it is deep in that it aims to produce a meaning\nrepresentation direct from English text without passing through a syntax\nanalysis...However, Wilensky and Arens do make claims about how to get to the\nrepresentation, and these include considerations we have called superficial"\n( Wilks:1983,235).\n\n\nWilks has been quoted at length here not so much to lengthen this\nsection as to support the point made that a completely deep system is quite\nimpossible.\n\n\nIf we were to examine the three quotes, we will see that all three\nsystems are superficial on the basis of method, and it is almost always at\nthe onset of the parsing process.\n\n\nThis very likely means that no matter how deep a system may be ( or\nclaim to be), it cannot escape being superficial at least in the beginning\nphase.\n\n\n 2.1.4 A proposal for a better linguistic component \n\n\nThe quest for deep rather than superficial systems lies in the\nassumption that the human mind is a deep system.\n\n\nWe have argued above that no system can be completely deep.\n\n\nFrom these two premises, we may conclude that what we want is a\nsystem that may have superficial elements in the method of parsing, but is\nessentially deep in its philosophy.\n\n\nIts basis should be semantics, but syntax should not be discounted as\na possible starting point in the parsing process.\n\n\nIt can easily be proven that the human mind takes information in\nlittle chunks, and these chunks more often than not correspond to syntactic\nstructures that are complete in themselves ( constituents, eg NP, PP etc).\n\n\nFor example, the message " John gave Mary a rose for Valentine\'s Day"\nmay be decoded as:\n\n\nJohn - gave - Mary - a rose - for Valentine\'s Day NP V NP NP PP PersA\nAction PersB Thing Reason\n\n\nie Person A carries out Action which affects Person B using Thing\nbecause of Reason.\n\n\nThe message will very unlikely be decoded as:\n\n\nJohn gave - Mary a - rose for Valentine\'s - Day because this way of\nfragmenting the sentence does not correspond to the way the human brain takes\nin information, and it is interesting to note that the fragments also do not\ncorrespond to any grammatical constituents.\n\n\nSince we understand natural language by breaking up larger bits into\nsmaller ones, we could have a system that does the same thing.\n\n\nAt the deep level of understanding, Wilks\' system might serve as our\nmodel.\n\n\nHis idea, in a nutshell, is to fragment an input text according to\nkey words, match these fragments to all possible templates ( which are\nfundamental units of meaning representation that model the intuitive\nprocesses of the human mind), compare competing templates, and finally decide\non the most densely packed block of templates as the perfect representation\nof the input text.\n\n\nThis sounds very complicated, and in fact, its latter steps do not\nreally model how our brains work.\n\n\nA point of criticism is that we do not process all possible ways of\ninterpreting a sentence before deciding on one.\n\n\nWe normally hit on one and stick to that interpretation until we are\nproven wrong, and then we \'backtrack\' and try again.\n\n\nHence, our system might be as follows:\n\n\nStep 1: Fragment input text according to syntactic constituents (\nperhaps using the syntactic dependency system in dependency grammar)\n\n\nStep 2: Match fragments to best possible template.\n\n\nThe best possible part may be taken care of by the \'pragmatic\' domain\ncomponent ( how this is to be done, I haven\'t the faintest idea)\n\n\nStep 3:Output is representation of the input text ( ! )\n\n\nIf proven otherwise, backtrack to Step 2\n\n\n 2.2 The domain component \n\n\nThis component encodes domain knowledge, that is, knowledge on how an\ninput sentence should be interpreted or generated relative to non-linguistic\ninformation.\n\n\nThe main reason for having this component is " so that there is a\nclear distinction between its understanding/generative capabilities which\nrely strictly on linguistic knowledge and those which rely on domain\nknowledge" ( Course notes, 105).\n\n\nThe domain component would hence take care of the pragmatic aspects\nof language.\n\n\nHow exactly this component is to be built is way beyond the scope of\nthis report ( and I suspect, my abilities), but we might say that probably a\nseparate lexicon, similar to the one in the linguistic component, will be\nnecessary, and that each lexical entry will have all the essential pragmatic\ninterpretations relevant to the database encoded on it.\n\n\nWe see some sort of domain knowledge at work in the logical evaluator\nof the present interface.\n\n\nThe interpretation of a yes-no query for this particular database\ngives only yes or no answers.\n\n\nThis is because there are no grey areas in the queries that can be\nasked.\n\n\nSomething is either A or not-A.\n\n\nFor example, the query " Is p a stop?" necessarily gives yes as the\nanswer.\n\n\nIt could very well be no, but never anything else, like \'maybe\' or \'sometimes\'\netc.\n\n\nThe range of answers in this sense is determined pragmatically and\nnot linguistically.\n\n\n 2.3 The generator \n\n\nThere is NO generator in the present Consonant Interface.\n\n\nA simple displayer takes its place, and it serves the purpose of\ndisplaying the answer to the queries fed into the system. \n\n\nA real generator, however should be able to piece together bits of\nabstract data from the database and construct them into a logical, coherent\ntext.\n\n\nJust like in text analysis ( parsing), text generation also takes\nplace in steps.\n\n\nFirst we must consider what we want to say ( ie data retrieved from\nthe database), when to say it ( ie the order in which the data is to be\npresented), and finally, how to say it.\n\n\nMcKeown ( 1985) discusses this, and proposes that language\nproduction be divided into two phases.\n\n\n" In the first phase, the content and structure of the discourse is\ndetermined.\n\n\nThe component embodying this phase is termed the \'strategic\'\ncomponent...The second, the \'tactical\' component, uses a grammar to translate\nthe message into English" ( McKeown:1985,5).\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that in parsing one moves from syntax to\nsemantics, while in generation, one moves in the opposite direction, ie from\nsemantics to syntax.\n\n\nAs for the domain component, the building of the generator is beyond\nthe scope of this essay, and so nothing more will be said about it.\n\n\n 3. Concluding remarks  We have seen that the Consonant\nInterface in its present state is inadequate.\n\n\nWe have also seen that merely augmenting it will not solve the\nproblem; a complete overhaul of the linguistic component, along with the\ninclusion of a proper, separate domain component, and a generator that can\ngenerate texts based on data from the database rather than just displaying\nthe answer to queries are needed.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '03205d63-1935-49da-95b8-89b192dc7f39', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.628060+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9369520545005798, 'non_english_score': 0.06304794549942017}
{'text': 'THE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE,\nSINGAPORE \n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n\n Policy Problem \n\n\nThe social development policy is the outgrowth of the problems of\nSingapore\'s pro-creation patterns as outlined by the Prime Minister Lee Kuan\nYew in his 1983 National Day Rally Speech.\n\n\nThere are two prongs to this lop-sided procreation pattern.\n\n\nOne is that Singaporeans, especially Chinese, are not reproducing\nenough to replace themselves so as to stabilise the level of population in\nthe long run.\n\n\nAccording to demographic theory, the ideal replacement level for a\npopulation is two children per family.\n\n\nThis level has not been achieved by Singaporeans.\n\n\nThe targeted zero population growth was based on the assumption that\npeople do get married, and that the crude birth rate remained constant, which\nis not so in Singapore.\n\n\nThe second prong of the problem is Lee\'s concern with the quality of\nthe population: that more female graduates are remaining single and thus not\nrepresented in the next generation.\n\n\nThis problem is caused by the traditional preference by Asian men,\nespecially Chinese men, to marry women of lower or equal social and economic\nstatus and Asian women\'s preference to marry men of equal of(or) higher\nsocial and economic status.\n\n\nIt is the perception of the PAP government that if this trend is\nallowed to continue, the quality of the population would suffer in the long\nrun as:\n\n\n" Our economy will falter, the administration will suffer, and the\nsociety will decline.\n\n\nFor how can we avoid lowering our standards, when in 25 years\' time,\nfor every 2 graduates there will be one graduate, and for every 2 uneducated\nworkers there will be 3?"\n\n\nLee\'s concern about well-educated women was also highlighted in the\nability of educated women who were married to reproduce themselves above the\nreplacement level.\n\n\nIn 1983, the fertility rate was only 1.65 children for those women\nwith tertiary education, 2.0 children for those women with an upper secondary\neducation, 2.7 children for women with a primary education, and 3.5 for those\nwomen without any education.\n\n\nLee\'s assumption has been that nature determines 80% of a person\'s\nintelligence.\n\n\nHis arguments became a moot point and stirred the so-called great\nMarriage debate and the Population Debate.\n\n\nLee has, however, achieved the result of starting the nation to think\nabout the population trends of Singapore and their implications for\nSingaporeans.\n\n\nThe social development policy, which was on most occassions (\noccasions) associated with the policy to get educated singles married, can be\nsaid to have been implemented in January 1984 with the establishment of the\nSocial Development Unit ( SDU).\n\n\nThis paper is a case study of how this national policy is being\ntransplanted into the Ministry of Defence ( MINDEF).\n\n\nThe focus of the paper is narrow so as to allow an in-depth study of\nthe policy issue within MINDEF, and to avoid a general system-level analysis\nwhich have been attempted by former students of this course on at least two\noccassions.\n\n\nThe narrowed scope of focus will help to keep the project within\nmanageable length and effort.\n\n\nAnother government policy to tackle the population problem is to\nembark on an aggressive immigration policy to attract overseas talent to\nmigrate to Singapore.\n\n\nThis policy has been dealt with in another seminar earlier on and is\nnot within the scope of this paper.\n\n\nIt is contended, however, that the net benefits from the inflow of\noverseas talent may be small in the long term.\n\n\nThe solution to the population problem has to be supplied by\nindigenous efforts to the larger extent, by increasing the relative value of\nhaving children and to reduce the push factors that encourage people to\nmigrate from Singapore.\n\n\nThe immigration policy is more a stop-gap measure to Help balance the\nso-called \'brain-drain\'.\n\n\n Aim and Methodology \n\n\nThe aim of the paper is to throw light on how the singles problem and\nsocial development is being tackled in MINDEF.\n\n\nThe framework of analysis would be geared to look at the policy\ncontext of the singles problem within MINDEF, the formulative aspects of the\npolicy, how the policy was implemented, and finally to attempt to evaluate\nthe policy.\n\n\n Policy Context \n\n\nThe national context of the pro-creation problem was set out clearly\nin a publication by Ministry of Finance called Sharing a Lifetime.\n\n\nThey include cultural and structural factors.\n\n\nThe over-riding concern of the government, however, is that tiny\nSingapore is without any natural mineral resources, and the quality and\nquantity of its population is the only factor that is within the manipulation\ncapability of the state.\n\n\nIntelligent, skilled and sufficient manpower is also the only\nredeeming factor that Singapore can depend on for its future growth and\nsurvival.\n\n\n Cultural Factors \n\n\nOur Asian culture, where the man wants to be the dominant partner in\na marital relationship and thus would feel more comfortable with a less\neducated wife.\n\n\n Structural Factors \n\n\nThe meritocratic system which stresses on academic qualifications,\nand result and achievement oriented attitudes, which leads to few\nopportunities for young men and women to meet since they deem it as more\nimportant to concentrate on getting good results in their academic\nexaminations and work excellence.\n\n\nThe problem is especially acute during schooling days, which is the\nbest period for them to forge a lasting relationship.\n\n\nAlso, an average 63% of boys who did well enough at \'O\' levels chose\nto enter polytechnics instead of college/pre-university classes.\n\n\nThese boys are apprehensive of the second language and general paper\nrequirements for entry into the National University of Singapore, the only\nuniversity at the moment.\n\n\nThe girls tend to fair better in these subjects.\n\n\nThere is thus a drop in the number of men entering the university,\nespecially in those faculties where language is important.\n\n\nEconomic development has led to specialisation in professions\naccording to sex.\n\n\nHere in Singapore, gender differences tend to be well reflected in\nthe cross-industry segregation of the sexes.\n\n\nThe huge majority in the engineering and technical professions are\nmen, whereas the teaching, accounting and other service professions tend to\nbe dominated by women.\n\n\nThis industrial segregation tends to reduce the opportunities for men\nand women to meet.\n\n\nWhere the state has successfully achieved an economic development\nprogramme to provide for basic services.\n\n\nIn Singapore, it is argued that the PAP government\'s ability to\nprovide amenities and invest in labour quality to facilitate upward social\nmobility independent of kinship connections have greatly affected family\nlives.\n\n\nThis is because the state agencies fulfilled many personal needs that\nhave traditionally been satisfied via kinship and personal ties.\n\n\nAs early as 1969, there were observations that in line with\nmodernisation and economic development, traditional mechanisms for mate\nselection, especially among the Chinese, have broken down.\n\n\nThere has been a movement away from parental dominance in marital\nchoice and young people were beginning to spend more time in pre-marital\nrelationships with the opposite sex.\n\n\nThis increasing contact, independent of parental pressure cultivated\nthe ideology of personal and free choice as a pre-requisite to conjugal bliss\nand contributed to the breaking-down of the institutions of match-making.\n\n\nThe value of children appeared to have declined in the post\nindependence years, particularly after the government adopted rapid\nindustrialisation as the path to rapid economic growth and development.\n\n\nThe institution of the Central Provident Fund helped to guarantee a\nfinancially stable life for the retired even without the help of their\nchildren.\n\n\nIn addition, in view of the existence of a huge unemployment problem\nin the 1960s, a strongly anti-natalist population policy was adopted to\npronounce the benefits of having two or less children, one of which was the\nstrengthened ability and better hope of a family ascending socially if it had\nless children to divide the family pie.\n\n\nThe value of children in providing long term security and immediate\ncomfort became relatively less, with a resulting impact on fertility desires\nand behaviour.\n\n\nIn summation, structural and cultural, factors have shaped the\ncircumstances of the population problem of the 1980s, which is now one of the\nmain policy priorities of the government.\n\n\nAt the level of this case study, MINDEF and the SAF have their policy\ncontext which are unique to the defence organisation.\n\n\nThey are mainly structural, cultural and situational factors.\n\n\nCulturally, the business of defence is a demanding job.\n\n\nWithout any compromise or alternative, the nature of the business\nrequires that the majority of the SAF is male.\n\n\nWhat\'s more, there is an uneven distribution of men and women in SAF\nworkplaces, due to the nature of their respective functions which are\ndistributed according to gender differences.\n\n\nThe men are mostly concentrated in the combat and active units and\nthe women in civilian departments and support units.\n\n\nThis lessens the opportunities for the SAF men and women to meet\nprospective partners within or without the Force, especially when a tiring\nday at the office and units sapped their energies.\n\n\nAlso, the defence business requires that there is constant\npreparedness and regular training be conducted among men.\n\n\nTight training schedules, shift work and being put on course\nfrequently are often the direct contributing factors in reducing the amount\nof time for socialising, which soldiers, especially men, have to give up for\nthe sake of career and country.\n\n\nWhat\'s more, the far location of the units makes the process of\ndisseminating information about social activities difficult and cumbersome,\nand information often do not reach the servicemen in time for him to\nparticipate in those activities.\n\n\nSituationally, circumstances like long hours of work during military\nexercises, mobilisation exercises, the distance and location of the unit from\nthe centres of social interaction, and the perhaps unsupportive attitudes of\nsome superior officers in granting leave or time-off may hamper opportunities\nfor single servicemen to interact socially.\n\n\nAs at 31/12/1987, about 64% of the SAF regulars ( excluding a large\nnumber of single young men in Full-time National Service) remains single.\n\n\nThe majority of these singles are below 30 years old, and 65% of them\nare below 24.\n\n\nTherefore, although MINDEF is perceived by the SDU as having a large\npool of singles alongside other ministries like Education, National\nDevelopment, trade and Industry, Health and Home Affairs, it can be seen that\nthe age structure of MINDEF\'s singles render it a problem that is not as\nserious as in other cases.\n\n\nSpecifically, the SAF single male officers generally should not have\na problem in finding life partners due to the SAF\'s successful efforts in\nrecent years to raise the social esteem of the soldiering occupation and of\nits officers ranks especially.\n\n\nDue to their reasonable pay and job security, male Force officers are\nin fact among the most eligible bachelors.\n\n\nAmong the married in the Force, 81% of them have no children, and 51%\nof the childless are in the 25-34 age group.\n\n\nThis is the more serious aspect of the population problem existing\nwithin MINDEF and the SAF.\n\n\nHow then, have MINDEF and the SAF set out to tackle the problem?\n\n\n Policy Formulation \n\n\nHaving identified the policy problem, MINDEF set out to formulate a\npolicy to resolve the problem.\n\n\nPolicy formulation, as defined by Anderson, " involves the\ndevelopment of pertinent and acceptable proposed courses of action for\ndealing with public problems." If a necessary course of action in the process\nof policy formulation is to identify all alternatives possible within certain\ntime, space, resource and cultural constraints, then there is no such course\nof action taken in MINDEF.\n\n\nRather, current policies are the result of incremental developments.\n\n\nIn early 1987, a Social Development Section ( SDS) was set up as a\nbranch of the SAF Personnel Services Centre ( SAFPSC) as NINDEF\'s follow-up\nto the establishment of the SDU within the Ministry of Finance.\n\n\nPrior to this, the Officers\' Personnel Centre of MINDEF had within\nits structure a MINDEF Social Interaction Committee ( MSIC) with only a\npart-time staff.\n\n\nIn comparison, the SDS in SAFPSC had a full-time staff instead, which\nwas justified by an expansion of singles development activities to include \'A\'\nand \'O\' level singles in MINDEF.\n\n\nWhile the duties of the MSIC\n\n\nwas only to provide information about an nominate singles to\nparticipate in SDU activities - publicise SDU activities within MINDEF -\nparticipate in policy making at the SDU, the role of the SDS became a)To plan\nand assist in the interaction of singles through activities, with its own\nbudget and manpower support and data base. \n\n\nb.

{'text': 'INTRODUCTION \n\n\nIn his discussion on what constitutes worthwhile sociolinguistics, (\nWardhaugh 1986:11) says, " specific points of connection between language and\nsociety must be discovered, and these must be related within theories that\nthrow light on how linguistic and social structures interact".\n\n\nSo it seems appropriate that a discussion on the usefulness of the\nconcept of social class in a sociolinguistic survey in Singapore, should\nentail how well the concept systematically captures salient features in the\nSingapore society, to allow a meaningful explanation of the pattern and habit\nof language use here.\n\n\nTo set the context of discussion, this essay will outline some general\nfeatures of the society in Singapore.\n\n\nThe concept of social class as defined in Singapore will then be\nexamined.\n\n\nAn attempt will be made in assessing the effectiveness of the concept\nas a system in capturing social features which help explain language use.\n\n\n General Features of Singapore \n\n\nSingapore is a small nation state of nearly three million people, void\nof natural resources and heavily dependent on international trade and its\nhuman resources for economic survival.\n\n\nThe population is multi-ethnic, with official recognition of three\nmain ethnic groups: Chinese 77.7%, Malays 14.1%, Indians 7.1%, and 1.1% of\nvarious other ethnic origins ( Lau 1992:5).\n\n\nThere are four official languages, three of them official ethnic\nmother tongues related to each dominant ethnic group: Chinese Malay and\nTamil.\n\n\nEnglish, the fourth official language is part of the British colonial\nlegacy.\n\n\nIt is not identified with any ethnic group in Singapore, but plays a\npredominant role in government administration, commerce, international trade,\nand formal education.\n\n\nThe linguistic situation in Singapore is more complex than the\nofficial ethnic and language categorisations suggest.\n\n\nSubsumed under each official ethnic label are different sub-groups\nwhich speak different native dialects, often mutually unintelligible.\n\n\nSingapore life is characterised by the mentality of top-down planning\nsince the independence of the country in 1965.\n\n\nBecause of the primacy of human resources and external trade for\neconomic survival, and added to that the potentially volatile\nethnic-linguistic diversity of the population, policy-makers have been\nespecially interested in education and language planning.\n\n\nGiven its small physical size and effective means of communication,\npolicies are implemented swiftly, and their impact penetrating.\n\n\nIt is against such a background of ethnic-linguistic complexity and\ndynamic social planning, that the concept of social class and its relevance\nto a sociolinguistic survey in Singapore are discussed.\n\n\n Social Class in Singapore \n\n\nThere are generally two theoretical approaches to the concept of\nsocial class: the conflict approach and the functional approach ( Theodorson\n1990).\n\n\nIn the classical conflict theory of Marx, there are two groups with\nconflicting interests within a capitalist society: the ruling class which\ncontrols the means of production, and the proletariat whose labour is\nexploited by the ruling elite.\n\n\nIn Weber\'s theory, conflict within society is multi-dimensional, with\ndifferent groups controlling access to different resources.\n\n\nThe functional approach assumes that there is social consensus in the\nevaluation of the relative importance of different functional positions.\n\n\nIncome and occupational prestige are given according to the relative\nimportance of one\'s function in society.\n\n\nThey are therefore important indicators of one\'s social class status.\n\n\nEducational attainment, which is the mark of one\'s qualification to\nperform a function, is the third important indicator of one\'s social class\nstatus.\n\n\nA recent sociological study of social class in Singapore ( Quah et al\n1991), seems to have synthesized the conflict and functional approaches.\n\n\nAs the study is not only the latest, but also " the first published\nsociological study of social class in Singapore" ( Quah et al 1991:1), the\ndiscussion on the relevance of the concept of social class in a\nsociolinguistic survey in Singapore, has to involve examining the study to a\ncertain extent.\n\n\nIn theoretical conceptualisation, the study adopts the conflict\napproach.\n\n\nThe researchers set out to examine social class in Singapore, based\non the view of conflict theorist Dahrendorf, that social classes exist "\nwhenever authority is unequally distributed over social positions" (\nDahrendorf 1959:245 as quoted in Quah et al 1991:26).\n\n\nIn the objective method of study, Weber\'s multi-dimensional approach\nis adopted.\n\n\nSocial class status is measured in three different dimensions which\nare essentially the social class indicators of the functional approach:\nincome level, educational attainment and occupational status.\n\n\nThe three hierarchies are then combined into a socio-economic status\n( SES) scale.\n\n\nThe integration of the three hierarchies into one single scale\nappears well founded.\n\n\nAs in other modern countries where social status is achieved rather\nthan ascribed, the study found close correlation between the three social\nclass indicators of income, educational level and occupation prestige.\n\n\nOne important finding that the study reveals is that there is neither\na dominant monolithic social class bloc in Singapore, nor discrete social\nclasses.\n\n\nRather, the study discovers, Singaporeans are found along the entire\nSES scale, forming a social class continuum  SES Continuum and Lectal\nContinuum in Singapore English \n\n\nAs one unitary scale which aptly captures the educational attainment,\nincome and occupation prestige of Singaporeans, the social class continuum\nseems to be a plausible systematic framework that captures the essentials of\nthe Singapore society.\n\n\nIt ties monetary and job prestige rewards to educational attainment\nwhich includes knowledge of English.\n\n\nIndeed, the notion of a social class continuum has appeared to be an\nimportant concept in the sociolinguistic description of English use in\nSingapore.\n\n\nPlatt and Weber ( 1980) describe sub-varieties of English in\nSingapore as a lectal continuum which corresponds with socio-economic\nranking.\n\n\nThey see the relationship between the two continuums as follows:\n\n\n( Platt & Weber 1980:109)\n\n\nFoley ( 1988) demonstrates that the model of lectal continuum has\nbeen accepted by many linguists as an adequate description of Singapore\nEnglish for more than a decade since its introduction in 1975.\n\n\nAs much as the lectal continuum is a meaningful socio-linguistic\nconceptualisation of Singapore English, the underlying concept of a social\nclass continuum seems also to be a useful conceptual tool in sociolinguistic\nsurveys in Singapore.\n\n\n Shortcomings of Platt\'s lectal model / Inadequacies of Social\nClass Continuum \n\n\nHowever, Foley also points out the shortcoming of the model. \n\n\n\nPlatt\'s model does not seem to distinguish between uneducated and\nthe informality of an educated speaker.\n\n\nHe calls both basilectal.\n\n\nAlso the different lects are difficult to identify in actual\ndiscourse and lack sociolinguistic and psychological reality.\n\n\n( Foley 1988:13)  \n\n\nFoley\'s comments bring out the point that the variety of English used\nby a Singaporean at any particular time, is affected by his both his\neducational background and the context of use.\n\n\nAt first sight, it may seem that Platt\'s lectal continuum model\nneatly accounts for the correlation between a Singaporean\'s education\nbackground and the variety of English he uses.\n\n\nBut what the model accounts for is only the educational level he has\nattained, not the type of education he has had.\n\n\nIn Singapore, there were schools where English was the medium of\ninstruction, and others where it was one of the official ethnic languages.\n\n\nClearly those with an English stream education would be more\nproficient in their English.\n\n\nAs the education system with different streams was only phased out in\nthe late 1980s, and practically all adult Singaporeans are affected by the\ntype of education in their use of English.\n\n\nBut the concept of social class continuum, as much as Platt\'s lectal\ncontinuum, clearly omits the educational type of Singaporean.\n\n\nIt is therefore handicapped as a tool in sociolinguistic surveys in\nSingapore.\n\n\nReferring to Foley\'s criticism of Platt\'s lectal continuum, the\nformality of a situation has to be considered in a description of the use of\nlanguages.\n\n\nIn the case of Singapore English, the tendency is to move towards\nwhat Platt terms the basilectal variety with the informality of the\nsituation.\n\n\nIn addition, the background of the person one is speaking to also\nforms an integral part of the context of speech.\n\n\nAn English-educated Singaporean with a command of both the formal\neducated variety of English and the informal variety, would not speak the\neducated variety to someone who understands only the informal variety if he\nwishes to be understood.\n\n\nHis use of the informal variety at that point in time in no way\ncharacterises him as someone of low education.\n\n\nIn omitting the important contextual dimension of language use, the\nconcept of social class is yet again found wanting as a tool in\nsociolinguistic survey in Singapore.\n\n\nHowever, an assessment of the usefulness of the concept of social\nclass should not only constitute social class defined as a continuum.\n\n\nThe viability of the conflict interpretation in organising\nindividuals within a society into discrete social classes should also be\nconsidered.\n\n\n Conflict Approach to Social Class \n\n\nGuy ( 1988:46-47) in discussing the impact of colonialism on class\nand language, mentions that in the multilingual ex-colonies, the language of\nthe ex-colonial power often retains its functions and primacy.\n\n\nThis is because the language serves the exclusive purpose for the\nindigenous elite in administration, legal and educational functions as it did\nfor the foreign one.\n\n\nSuch a stark picture of power play may not be reflective of Singapore\nsince access to the language of primacy is provided as a crucial component of\nuniversal education.\n\n\nBut the dichotomy between the ruling elite and the ruled may be a\nuseful tool in discussing language issues in Singapore.\n\n\nThis is especially so, given the reality of top-down planning in\nSingapore life.\n\n\nFor instance, in the pronunciation of English, official practices\nhave insisted on using British Received Pronunciation ( RP) as a model.\n\n\nThis is so despite the impracticality of the idea, since there is no\nstrong RP-speaking community in Singapore to serve as a reference group ( Tay\nand Gupta:1983).\n\n\nConsidering that there is another native variety with greater\ncurrency, and that a remote foreign model is hardly the ideal medium to\nexpress national identity, the insistence on RP as a model seems an\nidiosyncratic preoccupation of the leading elite.\n\n\nExtending the argument to the micro level, the conflict model may be\nused to explain phonological or morphological variables in Singapore English\nas Milroy and Milroy ( 1992) suggest.\n\n\nWithin this framework, it is not surprising that Platt\'s acrolectal\nSingapore English should be exclusively associated with those in better-paid\nprofessional occupations, since in the Marxist notion of the linguistic\nmarket, language is a form of cultural and social capital that can be\ntransformed into economic capital.\n\n\nHowever, the conflict model seems limited in usefulness.\n\n\nIts function seems confined to providing a theoretical framework for\nexplaining what has already been uncovered in earlier sociolinguistic survey\nor sociolinguistic oddities initiated top-down.\n\n\nIt provides no measurable variable which could be systematically used\nin a sociolinguistic survey.\n\n\nAnd there is one important social factor affecting language use which\nis easily distinguished, but yet not accounted for in either definition of\nsocial class - ethnicity.\n\n\n Importance of Ethnicity \n\n\nThe ethnicity and to a lesser degree the ethnic sub-group affiliation\nof a Singaporean often determine the languages present in his verbal\nrepertoire.\n\n\nFor instance, a Singapore Chinese belonging to the Hainanese\ndialectal group, may have English, Mandarin and Hainanese in his verbal\nrepertoire, but his Malay friend may have English, Tamil and Malay in his.\n\n\nIf one considers the influence of native tongue in the phonological,\nsyntactic and lexical features of English spoken by a Singaporean, and if one\nconsiders in addition, the role native tongue plays in the phenomenon of\ncode-switching, ethnicity is certainly a factor that cannot be left out in a\nsociolinguistic survey regardless of whether the study is at a general or\nmicro level.\n\n\nYet there is hardly a way in which ethnic differences can be\nrepresented in the social class concept.\n\n\nEspecially when the recent study by Quah et al finds that " each\ninterval or category of social class scores, from the lowest to the highest,\npresents a multi-ethnic composition, and in each interval, the largest group\nis the Chinese ...\n\n\nthis is expected considering that Chinese form 76.1% of the\npopulation" ( Quah et al 1991:86).\n\n\n Sex \n\n\nTay ( 1979) lists sex as a factor affecting the use of English among\nSingaporeans.\n\n\nThis is a factor which the concept of social class also omits.\n\n\nDifferent socialisation of girls and boys may account for their\ndifference in language use.\n\n\nBut the difference in language habits between the sexes may not be as\nsignificant as the factor of ethnicity discussed above. \n\n\nIn Singapore, the difference in ethnicity often implies the\ninfluence of a different native language, but no such marked difference goes\nwith the difference in sex.\n\n\nProbably more important is that the women\'s personal achievements\naffecting their language habits are not faithfully reflected in a SES\nranking.\n\n\nFor instance, a woman graduate who is a full-time homemaker without\nan income would rank lower in the SES scale than her peer who is holding a\nprofessional job.\n\n\nThe two could logically be exhibiting similar speech habits, but\ntheir possible social class ranking would indicate that as an oddity.\n\n\nHowever, this may be more a problem with the method of social class\nranking, than with the concept of social class per se.\n\n\n Age \n\n\nMore important than sex, seems to be a person\'s age in the effect\nit has on language use in Singapore.\n\n\nTay ( 1979) points out that literacy in Singapore, especially in\nEnglish, varies inversely with age.\n\n\nThe younger the Singaporean, the greater the likelihood that he\nunderstands English.\n\n\nSimilarly while the older generations of Singapore Chinese tend to\nhave their native Chinese dialect in their verbal repertoire, young\nSingaporeans, especially those aged fifteen and below are likely not to.\n\n\nInstead they are more likely to speak Mandarin where the native\nChinese dialects are used in their parents\' generation.\n\n\nBoth cases are results of penetrating implementation of language\npolicies in post independence Singapore.\n\n\nIn the case of English, the policy concerned is the drive of the\npost-independent government in providing young Singaporeans with educational\nopportunities of which English learning is an integral part.\n\n\nIn the case of Mandarin, it is the government\'s policy of promoting\nthe use of Mandarin in the place of the other Chinese dialects within the\nChinese community launched just over a decade ago.\n\n\nPolicies do result in significant changes in Singapore in as soon\nas a generation, due to the small physical size of the country, which\nfacilitates swift penetrating influence of the policies.\n\n\nSingaporeans separated by just the age of a generation could\nexhibit quite different language habits.\n\n\nAge is certainly a factor which cannot be overlooked in a\nsociolinguistic survey.\n\n\n Conclusion \n\n\nFrom the above discussion, social class proves to be too limited as\na concept to adequately capture the complex relationship between society and\nlanguage use in the multi-lingual, multi-ethnic society of Singapore.\n\n\nFor unlike generally monolingual and mono-ethnic societies where\none language structure interacts with one social structure which is primarily\nsocio-economic in nature, in a multi-lingual and multi-ethnic society such as\nSingapore, different language structures interact with the different facets\nof society, from the ethnic to the socio-economic in the use of language.\n\n\nAnd, adding to the complexity in Singapore, is the pervasive\ninfluence of top-down planning.\n\n\nA shift in language policy essentially leads to a change in the\npattern of language use over just one generation, at least at the general\nlevel of the choice of languages or dialects.\n\n\nTo overcome the complex diversity in the Singapore sociolinguistic\nscene, it might be more useful looking at individuals rather than blocs of\nthe society.\n\n\nMilroy\'s concept of social network, with the individual as anchor,\nmight be a more useful concept in sociolinguistic surveys in Singapore.\n\n\nFollowing the suggestion of Milroy and Milroy ( 1992) perhaps the\nfindings at the micro level might then be explained within the macro\nframework of a conflict-based social class model.\n\n\nThe dichotomy of the society into the policy-making class and the\ngeneral population would quite neatly account for the tendency towards\ntop-down language habit changes in Singapore, where top-down planning seems\nto be a way of life.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'Question: Given the stable environment enjoyed by Singaporeans, the\nend of Cold War and good relations with neighbouring countries, it is\nincreasingly difficult to convince the population on the need to continue\nspending 6 per cent GDP and maintaining two and half years National Service.\n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n\nThe end of Cold War has created conditions that has given cause for\nsome optimism.\n\n\nThe United Nations has emerged as a strengthened organisation,\nexemplified by its actions during the Gulf War of 1991, in its relief efforts\nin Somalia and in finding a solution to the Cambodian conflict.\n\n\nIn Afghanistan, the Najibullahs and Mujahideens, who were aided by\nUnited States and the former Soviet Union respectively, are working towards a\nresolution to end civil wars.\n\n\nIn the Middle East, the Arabs and the Israelis are negotiating for a\npeaceful settlement.\n\n\nIn South East Asia ( SEA), significant progress has been made towards\na peaceful solution, after a lapse of 12 years, on the Cambodian issue.\n\n\nEven Vietnam, with the termination of aid from the former Soviet\nUnion, has decided to come to terms with China and the rest of the world.\n\n\nAs a result, tensions, anxieties, mistrust and general suspicion\nbetween blocs and among countries have been substantially reduced.\n\n\nIn Singapore, the threat of communism has subsided and external\nrelations with its two immediate neighbours, Indonesia and Malaysia, have\nstrengthened.\n\n\nThe construction of the second causeway between Singapore and\nMalaysia and joint economic developments with Indonesia under the " Growth\nTriangle" initiative has resulted in a greater interdependence among the\nthree nations.\n\n\nApart from this, Singapore has many layers of security should it be\nunder seige by an aggressor.\n\n\nThe bilateral treaties with its neighbours and the United States and\nthe Five Power Defence Arrangements ensure that the sovereignty of Singapore\nwill be guarded.\n\n\nIn the light of these developments, Singaporeans have questioned the\nneed to continue spending 6 per cent of the GDP on defence and the need to\nhave two and half years of national service.\n\n\nThey argue that more funds need to be channelled to education and\nhealth and that a one year national service system ( like the Swiss system)\nshould be adopted.\n\n\nThey also believed that this would help to relieve the current\nmanpower shortages in the private and public sector.\n\n\nWhile the international and domestic conditions may bring political\nstability and peace, the euphoria that the world is going to be a harmonious\nplace in every corner will not be realised.\n\n\nIn an article entitled " Secret Warriors" in the 17 June 91 issue of\nTime magazine predicted that with the end of Cold War, future wars are likely\nto be small wars in the Third World.\n\n\nIndeed, the bulk of the territorial disputes in Asia have yet to be\namicably resolved and the South China Sea remains an area of potential\nconflict.\n\n\nBesides this, the arms race among the Asian states has intensified\nbecause of doubts about the military commitment of the United States in the\nregion due its domestic problems and the proposed budget cuts in US defence.\n\n\nAlready, the great and medium military powers in Asia such as China,\nIndia and Japan have become nuclear powers.\n\n\nNorth Korea, South Korea and Indonesia may soon be joining the ranks.\n\n\nApart from this, the removal of ideological confrontation between\ndemocracy and communism after the Cold War, has unmasked other tensions.\n\n\nIn Europe, these tensions have been manifested in the break-up of the\nSoviet Union and civil wars in Yugoslavia.\n\n\nIn China, it led to the bloody Tiananmen massacre of students by the\nmilitary.\n\n\n AIM OF PAPER \n\n\nThe aim of this paper is two fold.\n\n\nThe first is to explore the reasons to why is there a need to\nmaintain an expenditure of 6 percent of GDP for defence and as to why\nSingapore cannot afford to lower the duration for national service.\n\n\nThe other aim is to identify arguments that could be used to justify\nthe continued emphasis on defence.\n\n\nIn exploring the above areas, the paper will briefly focus on the\nthreat perceptions and Singapore\'s defence policy, the security situation and\nthe arms race in SEA which necessitate a strong deterrent strategy, total\ndefence and the role of the military, military industries and the economy and\nthe need to maintain the current duration of National Service.\n\n\nThe other part of the paper focuses on the present and potential\nstrategies that MINDEF ( Ministry of Defence) could use to justify the\nemphasis on defence.\n\n\nThe paper uses the two issues of defence expenditure and national\nservice in its analysis.\n\n\n THREAT PERCEPTIONS AND DEFENCE POLICY  In order to understand\nthe defence policy of Singapore, one has to look into the strategic\nenvironment and threat perceptions of the island state.\n\n\nThe most obvious vulnerability is the smallness of Singapore which is\na mere 621 kilometres in size.\n\n\nAs such, it does not have the strategic depth which is required for\nour forces to withdraw to the rear to revitalize itself and stage a counter\nattack on the invaders.\n\n\nIn Singapore\'s case, the front will also be its rear.\n\n\nIn this sense, the loss of the city means loss of the nation.\n\n\nCompounding the problem is the fact of geography.\n\n\nSingapore is located in close proximity to its neighbours\'\nterritorial waters and at the crossroads of major sea lanes of communication\nbetween the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.\n\n\nThus, there is a need for her to protect her sovereignty and her\nmaritime interests.\n\n\nThe third factor confronting Singapore is that of its limited\npopulation.\n\n\nThis is a serious constraint to the build-up of the defence forces\nand precludes the establishment of a large standing army.\n\n\nThe fourth factor is the ethnic mix of Singapore.\n\n\nThe issue of " Malay loyalty" in the event of an external conflict\nand overwhelming Chinese population in Singapore, which may add to the image\nof " Third China" to the perception of its immediate neighbours, have been an\nimpediment to closer relations between Singapore and its immediate\nneighbours.\n\n\nPolitical subversion is yet another threat which continues to reflect\nin the internal perception of the government.\n\n\nBut the absence of any serious challenge to internal security has\ndiminished this threat to a certain extent.\n\n\nThe defence policy of Singapore is moulded by its perceived threats.\n\n\nFirst, it relies on adroit diplomacy to encourage a favourable\nbalance of friendly external forces in the region.\n\n\nIn this regard, it encourages the military presence of the US in SEA\nas a counterweight to the medium powers in the region.\n\n\nSecondly, it emphasises development, economic growth and\nnation-building to reinforce domestic resilience and national identity.\n\n\nThirdly, it upgrades conventional military capability to provide\ncredible defence and deterrence against would-be aggressors.\n\n\nIf deterrence and diplomacy fails, the Singapore Armed Forces ( SAF)\nare expected to secure a swift and decisive victory over the aggressor.\n\n\nFourthly, it places the highest premium on cultivating close and\nspecial ties with its immediate neighbours to strengthen mutual confidence.\n\n\nSingapore\'s threat perceptions are well exemplified by its relatively\nhigh expenditure on defence.\n\n\nIn comparison with its ASEAN neighbours in 1990, it was found that\nSingapore had allocated the highest proportion of its GDP for defence.\n\n\nIn 1990, Singapore allocated 5.1 per cent of its GDP on defence while\nits immediate neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, allocated 3.8 per cent and\n1.5 per cent of their GDPs respectively for defence.\n\n\nIn monetary terms, the expenditure of Singapore and its immediate\nneighbours were about the same.\n\n\nSingapore spent US&dollar;1.7b on defence while Malaysia and Indonesia spent\nUS&dollar;1.56b and US&dollar;1.45b respectively.\n\n\nThailand had the largest military expenditure of US&dollar;2.06b ( see table\n1). \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\nASEAN States: Defence Spending for 1990\n\n\nCountry GDP Defence

EXPENDITURE OF SINGAPORE \n\n\nSingapore defence expenditure has remained at 6 percent of its GDP\nsince the 1970s.\n\n\nIt is likely that Singapore will have to maintain this expenditure as\nthe security situation is still volatile and external ties are fragile.\n\n\nIt appears foolhardy to cut defence expenditure or the duration of\nnational service especially when other ASEAN members are spending more on\ndefence.\n\n\nIn fact, with the withdrawal of the United States from SEA, the "\narms race" among our immediate neighbours has increased.\n\n\nMINDEF believes that 6 percent is the level that is needed yearly in\norder to secure the peace we have enjoyed for so long.\n\n\nIt is needed for investments in the essential aspects of Singapore\'s\ndefence.\n\n\nIn the context of Singapore, defence spending is seen as an\ninvestment rather than an expenditure.\n\n\nAccording to Dr Yeo Ning Hong, the Defence Minister, it is an\ninvestment in the country\'s security.\n\n\nDividends for this investment are paid and enjoyed on a daily basis\nin terms of peace and security, the foundation for our continued freedom,\neconomic growth and prosperity.\n\n\nThis is manifested by the vast progress Singapore has achieved since\nher independence\'.\n\n\nHe added that the defence expenditure is pegged to 6 per cent so that\nit acts as a ceiling for government spending on defence.\n\n\nAny expenditure above 6 per cent would come under close scrutiny by\nthe Cabinet and the Parliament.\n\n\nBesides, it does not necessarily mean that Singapore would spend the\ndefence budget allocated.\n\n\nIn most years, MINDEF has managed to keep its defence expenditure\nbelow the budget allocated to it.\n\n\nThe defence budget of Singapore for the financial year 1992 totalled\n&dollar;4 billion.\n\n\nThis constitutes about 6.2 per cent of the GDP and is 3.3 times\nhigher than the defence expenditure of 1974 which was 4.7 per cent of its\nGDP.\n\n\nBetween 1976 and 1977, the defence expenditure increased because the\nSAF embarked on the procurement of expensive hardware for the Army (\nvehicles, weapons and signals equipment), Air Force and Navy.\n\n\nFor the period of 1984 to 1986, Singapore further embarked on\nupgrading its air defence capabilities through the purchase of four E2\nHawkeye reconnaissance aircraft ( costing\n&dollar;945 million), the planned acquisition of eight Hawk Fighters (\n&dollar;624.4 million) and thirty SIAI-Marchetti trainer and light attack aircraft (\n&dollar;130 million).\n\n\nBetween 1988 and 1991 defence expenditure hovered at 5 to 6 per cent.\n\n\nThe details concerning Singapore\'s military expenditure for selected\nyears between 1974 and 1991 are shown in table 2.\n\n\nThe three basic components of the 1992 defence expenditure are\ncapital expenditure which includes purchases of aircraft, ships, tanks,\nhowitzer guns and small arms, salaries of regulars, national servicemen and\nmake up pay for reservists and finally operating costs.\n\n\nSingapore has to acquire high technology equipment so that it can be\ngeared to fight and win future wars.\n\n\nSince the SAF is small and only requires a small number of equipment,\nit cannot receive bulk discounts on its purchases.\n\n\nTherefore, it has to spend more relative to other larger armed\nforces.\n\n\nThe SAF also invest in simulators due to the lack of training grounds\nin order to provide realistic training for our servicemen.\n\n\nThe second component is that of salaries.\n\n\nWith a severe shortage of labour in Singapore, MINDEF has to pay well\nto attract the better Singaporeans to join the SAF.\n\n\nThe SAF cannot employ mediocre and incompetent people as the risks\ninvolved are high.\n\n\nThe final category is that of operating costs.\n\n\nThe SAF has to compensate for the constraints of land by training\noverseas so that the soldiers have realistic training.\n\n\nThis means that it has to incur greater costs in transporting its\ntroops, equipment and for lease of foreign training areas.\n\n\nFor the SAF to be an effective deterrent force against aggression,\nmanpower and weapons of the SAF should be at their best so that it would be\nan effective and modern fighting force despite falling national manpower\nresources.\n\n\n SECURITY SITUATION IN SEA \n\n\nAlthough Cold War has ended, the security situation in the Asia\nPacific region remains volatile and unpredictable.\n\n\nIn Myanmar, ethnic turmoil, a repressive regime and a disturbingly\nlarge standing army make the country a source of potential regional\ninstability.\n\n\nThe rise of political opposition to the Junta following the 1988\nmassacre of pro-democracy demonstrators has added fuel to the long running\nwar between the government and ethnic minorities along the borders with\nBangladesh, Thailand and China. \n\n\nIn Vietnam, economic reforms have raised expectations that probably\ncannot be met so long as the Communist Party retains its political\nstronghold.\n\n\nHanoi is also haunted by the spectre of unrest among disaffected\nmilitary leaders, particularly the South Vietnamese who are disillusioned by\nthe rule of the North.\n\n\nIn Cambodia, a UN brokered peace accord has broken down and there\nis potential for clashes between the Vietnam-backed regime in Phnom Penh and\nits main adversary, the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge.\n\n\nIn the Philippines, political instability persists as result of\ncommunist insurrection and military rivalry.\n\n\nThe economy is also not in a healthy state and this has been\nexacerbated by the closing of the US bases.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'fc3cdc65-a506-40f5-9109-95b5c0da6a9d', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.632171+00:00',

was the symbol of authority in the family and my father\nand his siblings were strictly disciplined as youths.\n\n\nWhat struck me was the great deal of respect the children had for\ntheir father, enduring his scolding and caning in silence.\n\n\nUnlike Lim Hue-Liang in the House of Lim who openly rebelled against\nhis father\'s discipline, my father and his two older brothers not only\naccepted their father\'s rebuke but even sacrificed chances for further\nstudies in the University then to support the family when Lee Pit Khiam\nsuffered from gastric cancer in later life.\n\n\nIn this way, their younger siblings were given the chance for higher\neducation.\n\n\nSuch a sacrifice spoke to me about the optimistic side of discipline.\n\n\nVirtues like filial piety and \'family before self\' were internalised\nin the children.\n\n\nThe bonds that hold brothers and sisters in the family are strong to\nthis day.\n\n\nMy mother\'s mother\'s mother, Tan Gek Khim, was born in Swatow in\n1900.\n\n\nShe came to Singapore with her parents as living conditions in China\nworsened.\n\n\nShe was match-made with a Straits-born widower, Tay Soo Chiang, who\nwas many years her senior.\n\n\nThe assimilation of Peranakan culture into Tan Gek Khim\'s lifestyle\nis interesting considering her very Chinese background.\n\n\nBesides having to learn to cook Peranakan dishes and wear a sarong\nkebaya, she also had to learn to speak the Malay language.\n\n\nHowever, in spite of all these changes, Chinese customs and\ntraditions were still kept intact in the family.\n\n\nTan Gek Khim explained that though her husband had been brought up in\nMalacca, his sense of belonging to the Chinese remained strong.\n\n\nBeing well-educated, Tay Soo Chiang held a considerably high post\nunder the British government.\n\n\nHe was able to foresee the importance of education at that time for\nhis four daughters, one of whom was my mother\'s mother, Tay Leong Chye, who\nwas born in 1923.\n\n\nTay Leong Chye and her sisters were educated at Geylang Methodist\nGirls\' School.\n\n\nI consider this unusual since girls at that time were hardly given\nthe opportunity to study as the boys were.\n\n\nI attribute this to the comfortable financial position of the family\nthen as well as the foresight of Tay Soo Chiang.\n\n\nHence economic factors and Tay Soo Chiang\'s educational attainment\ncontributed to the education of all his daughters.\n\n\nTay Leong Chye met Lim Bock Guan, also a Peranakan, and were married\nin 1943.\n\n\nMy mother, Lim Poh Choo, was born in 1947.\n\n\nMy parents met and were married in 1971.\n\n\nThe following year, I was presented to this world.\n\n\n The Family Today \n\n\nLike most families in Singapore, mine belongs to the nuclear\ncategory, consisting of my parents, my younger sister and myself.\n\n\nThe nuclear family in Singapore is one of the consequences of housing\npolicies laid down by the HDB ( Housing and Development Board) in 1960.\n\n\nAccording to recent statistics about 87% of Singapore\'s population\nlive in HDB flats.\n\n\nThe basically small size of the flats meant that most extended\nfamilies had to be broken up.\n\n\nThe traditional Chinese family consisting of three to four\ngenerations living under the same roof was no longer plausible.\n\n\nThe small size of my family is a result of the 2-child policy\nimplemented by the government in the 1970s.\n\n\nMost of my peers have only one other sibling in their families.\n\n\nThis was because " From the start the Singapore government is\ndetermined to limit population growth so that the hard-won fruits of economic\nprogress may not be depleted by a population explosion" ( Wong:218).\n\n\nAt the same time people realised that fewer children meant that they\nwere better able to provide the best for each child.\n\n\n" Nowadays, couples want children for reasons which are mainly\nconnected with personal fulfilment or for emotional satisfaction, as distinct\nfrom the \'traditional\' reasons such as for the continuity of the family name\nor for support in old age" ( Wong:217).\n\n\nI was initially surprised, from what I read here, that Chinese were\nno longer eager to have sons to perpetuate the family name.\n\n\nOn further checking on the 1973 FPPB ( Family Planning and\nProductivity Board) Survey, I realised that by and large, the general\npopulation of that time still preferred boys despite the FPPB slogan of \'Girl\nor Boy, two is enough\'.\n\n\nHowever, 18 years after that survey was conducted, most of my friends\ntell me that they really have no preference over the sex of their children.\n\n\nObviously, living in comfort and the enjoyment of a fulfilling family\nlife are the main concerns of most couples now.\n\n\nIndeed, times have changed.  Decision-making and the Elderly \n\n\nThe issue of decision-making cannot be alienated from economic\nfactors.\n\n\nFinancial contribution gives an individual a say in the running of\nthe family.\n\n\nIn my family it is not my father\'s mother or my mother\'s mother, but\nthe youngest members having earning abilities who have major dictatorship on\nhow the family is run.\n\n\nFor example, my grandmothers had little say over where my family was\ngoing to stay or the type of house we would live in.\n\n\nThis phenomena is well perceived in The House of Lim.  \n\n\nNowadays jobs outside the village give young men bargaining power\nwith their parents ( Wolf:65).  \n\n\nA recent report in the Straits Times, " Dead Men Shed No Tears" ( The\nStraits Times, November 10) spoke of the increasing number of suicide\nattempts by the elderly who feel abandoned by their children.\n\n\nI believe the average Singaporean\'s idea of filial piety has been\nreduced to a mere financial support.\n\n\nMuch of the traditional respect due to the elderly has been left\nbehind somewhere on our road to affluence.\n\n\nIt is indeed ironic that a country so close to \'excellence\' should be\nso lacking in its respect for the people who gave them life itself.\n\n\nMy grandmothers are well-cared for, but many of my peers agree with\nme that their advice and opinions are seldom appreciated.\n\n\n Women in the Family \n\n\nIn China where the one-child policy is being practised, thousands of\nfemale babies are killed each year because parents hope to have a son to\ncontinue the family line.\n\n\nAlthough sons were considered important to carry on the family name,\nmy mother was treated just as well as her brother.\n\n\nI am also fortunate to live in a family where girls are treasured as\nmuch as boys.\n\n\nWomen of today have a much greater say in affairs of the household.\n\n\nIndustrialisation gave good reason for women to find jobs outside\ntheir homes to supplement the family income.\n\n\nThis financial independence allows them a say in running the home as\nwell as enjoying a more egalitarian relationship with their husbands.\n\n\nCompulsory education has also helped the woman in her struggle for\nequal rights.\n\n\n" The most important reason women with young children take up\nemployment is economic, whilst the most important factor preventing them from\nseeking employment is the burden of childcare" ( Wong:57).\n\n\nThe modern woman in today\'s society finds herself constantly\nstraddling between her children and her career.\n\n\nMy mother and her mother both stopped working for the first few years\nafter childbirth to look after the children.\n\n\nConservative as I may sound, I still believe that a married woman\'s\nfirst and foremost priority is still her children and then her career.\n\n\n Expectations of Marriage \n\n\nMy mother\'s mother\'s mother\'s marriage was match-made.\n\n\nSince she hardly even met the guy before marriage, all she hoped for\nwas that he was well-off financially and kind towards her.\n\n\nCompared to the past, today\'s expectations of marriage partners seem\nmuch more complicated.\n\n\nFactors like race, religion, educational qualifications, financial\ndisposition and physical appearance come into play in the choice of a spouse\ntoday.\n\n\nMy father has told me that he " would rather die" than see me\nmarrying a Malay or an Indian.\n\n\nI have realised that though Singapore\'s religious harmony appears\ncommendable on the surface, prejudice against races other than our own still\nremain.\n\n\nMany conflicts have arisen since my sister\'s and my conversion to\nChristianity.\n\n\nDifferences in viewpoints and attitudes due to our different\nreligious beliefs ( my father\'s an atheist) have often resulted in quarrels\nand disharmony.\n\n\nI am hence more determined than before to marry a Christian man for\nmy sake as well as for my children\'s sake.\n\n\nI have always found it strange that in the face of differing religion\nand educational attainments ( my father\'s a senior middle 3 leaver while my\nmother\'s a graduate), my parents got together.\n\n\nObviously, these were not crucial factors to my parents then.\n\n\nRecent years have seen many graduate women left on the shelf.\n\n\nOn the one hand, they are not willing to settle for guys who were\nperhaps " less qualified" than they while on the other, neither were men\nwilling to shatter their male egos by marrying someone seemingly more capable\nthan them.\n\n\nClearly, modernisation of society has created a set of social\npressures by which we have been taught to conform to, even in the choice of a\nlife-long partner.\n\n\n Religion and the Family \n\n\nMy father\'s family members are predominantly Buddhists.\n\n\nThough my father himself is not a practising Buddhist in the sense\nthat he does not pray to any gods, he does do things like burn joss-sticks\non certain occasions to please his devout mother.\n\n\nWhether it be parental influence or anything else, the whole family\nseems quite happy settling with Buddhism as a religion.\n\n\nOn the other hand, my mother\'s family members are all either\nChristians or Catholics.\n\n\nMy mother is the only daughter-in-law in my father\'s family who is\nEnglish-educated as well as Christian.\n\n\nIt is evident that differences in religion as well as that of the\nlanguage of communication can sow seeds of division within the family.\n\n\nBut why Buddhism or Christianity?\n\n\nI believe that my father is an atheist by nature and is only a\nso-called Buddhist for the sake of his mother.\n\n\nMaybe that is too harsh a judgment.\n\n\nAfter all, Buddhism was a religion embraced particularly by the\nChinese in China as it speaks of the release from poverty in the process of\ndoing good to attain Nirvana.\n\n\nAs a result, it would be fair to conclude that Buddhism can be\nassociated with the Chinese-educated.\n\n\nMy mother\'s side of the family were all educated in English Mission\nschools.\n\n\nI hence deduce that the English-educated are more receptive and open\nto Christianity.\n\n\nIn a recent religious survey, it was shown that the majority of\nChristians in Singapore were the English-educated and the financially better\noff individuals.\n\n\nAs such, many of us have been led into thinking that Christianity is\na religion only for the " westernised" people in our society.\n\n\nI believe Christianity is not bound by educational standards or\nwealth.\n\n\nChina has one of the highest rates of conversion and many of these\nconverts are neither well-educated nor rich.\n\n\nProbably it is due to a lack of translation of the Christian message\ninto Mandarin or the other dialects that have hindered the Chinese-educated\nfrom embracing the religion here.\n\n\nAs the children of parents of different religions, my sister and I\nwere left with the decision of " which side to follow".\n\n\nThe reasons for our conversion to Christianity were hardly concrete\nones except probably that we were also educated in an English Mission school\nand we were, generally, closer to my mother\'s side of the family.\n\n\nHowever I believe that I would still be a Christian today even if\nthese factors were absent.\n\n\nI feel that the real reason for my conversion goes beyond a simple\nrationale for believing in God.\n\n\nI feel that conversion in itself is a supernatural occurrence and\nnot a philosophical reasoning.\n\n\n Conclusion \n\n\nMy sister and I are generally much closer to my mother\'s side of the\nfamily. \n\n\nThis could be because we had been looked after by my mother\'s\nmother from young.\n\n\nWe also share a common religion and a familiar language of\ncommunication.\n\n\nSometimes I feel a sense of loss when I sense barriers between\nmyself and my father\'s side of the family.\n\n\nIn fact I hardly knew the names of any of my cousins, father\'s\nbrothers or sisters before I had to come up with the genealogy.\n\n\nIt is so easy to just greet them respectfully during festive\noccasions when beneath all this superficiality lie seemingly irreconcilable\ndifferences.\n\n\nI am indeed grateful to my parents and my sister for all the\nsupport they have given me.\n\n\nTruly, I can proudly say that my family is not only a refuge from\nlife\'s storms but also one from which I can experience the joy of unfailing\nfamily bonds.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'Q5 \n\n\nThe structural approach to language learning sees language only as a means of \nstructuring information.\n\n\nThus, to learn language, one needs to learn the structure of language, that is, \nthe grammar of one\'s target language.\n\n\nThis was seen as the ultimate goal in language learning. \n\n\nThe functional/interactional approach however, sees language as the main mode of \ncommunication which humans use.\n\n\nTherefore, acquiring language means more than being able to use the language in \ngrammatically correct ways. \n\n\nIt means being able to use language appropriately depending on the contexts\nin which they are to be used. \n\n\nFor the structural approach, it sees the development of language as a \ndevelopment of linguistic competence, thus, it looks at how children acquire the \ngrammar/structure of language. \n\n\nAccording to Skinner\'s theory, language is learnt by children when they receive \na stimulus from their environment.\n\n\nThis stimulus, in turn, creates a response in the child. \n\n\nThus, the child learns language through imitation and practice of adults\' \nutterances. \n\n\nAdults also give them feedback ( concerning their utterances) in the form of \nreinforcement, as to whether their utterances are correct or incorrect.\n\n\nThus, children will learn whatever structures of language that are presented to \nthem. \n\n\nThe reason for the structuralist approach ( above) to language learning is \nbecause they believe that language is like a set of habits to be learnt one by \none.\n\n\nThus, language learning is a cumulative process, which enables structures to be \nlearnt one by one, finally resulting in the linguistic competence of the \nlearner. \n\n\nIn the functional/interactional approach however, children do not learn language \nthrough imitation and reinforcement. \n\n\nInstead, they learn language primarily through interacting with the people in \ntheir immediate environment. \n\n\nThrough this interaction, children become effective communicators of their \nlanguage.\n\n\nThus, in order to be able to communicate effectively, they must know the \nconventions of taking part in a conversation as well as know how to use language \ncorrectly ( linguistically). \n\n\nTherefore, the learning environment to be investigated here is the conversation, \nwhere language learning takes place. \n\n\nFrom the above, it can be seen that the structural approach to language \ndevelopment only explains language to a small extent. \n\n\nThis is because the approach believes that all a learner acquires about language \ncomes from his environment, and that knowledge of the environment is acquired \nthrough imitation, practice and reinforcement of language.\n\n\nHowever, experiments have shown that children only acquire a very small amount \nof their language through imitation.\n\n\nOn top of this, the structural approach implies that the learner is entirely \ndependent on the environment to supply him with his knowledge on language. \n\n\nThus, it sees the learner as a passive learner ( entirely dependent on the \nenvironment) and not an active one ( actively contributing to the language \nlearning process).\n\n\nAs a result of this, it must explain why, in language development, children \nproduce idiosyncratic forms not found in the adults\' grammar. \n\n\nFor example, a child was observed to continue saying the word " holded", even \nafter he was continuously told that the correct form was " held". \n\n\nThe child was impervious to correction, thus disproving the structural approach \nwhich claims that children will only produce structures found in the adults\' \ngrammar.\n\n\nAlso, it also proves that children do not correct their forms when they are \ngiven feedback from adults. \n\n\nThey only correct the forms which do not go against their own notions of the \ncorrectness of grammar. \n\n\nThe structural approach also claims that children only produce a response in the \npresence of a stimulus.\n\n\nHowever, this results in the approach not being able to explain why children \nvocalise even in the absence of a stimulus.\n\n\nFor example, Reich ( 1986) gives us an example about a child who continued his \nvocalizations even after his mother had put to bed.\n\n\nThus, the structural approach fails to explain this aspect of language \ndevelopment. \n\n\nThe structural approach also says that when children imitate adults\' utterances, \nit shows that they have grasped both the structure and the meaning behind the \nutterances. \n\n\nHowever, the approach fails to take into account that comprehension in children \nnormally precedes their production of the same semantic notion. \n\n\nThus, even a lack of imitation of the adults utterance on the part of the child \ndoes not mean that he ( the child) does not understand the concept. \n\n\nThus, the structural approach is wrong in equating imitation with understanding, \nas this clearly is not the case in language development in pre-school children.\n\n\nThe structural approach also fails to explain the speed at which children \nacquire language. \n\n\nIf children learn through imitation only, they would acquire language very \nslowly, as they would always have to wait for an adult to " teach" them the \nlanguage and provide them with data for imitation. \n\n\nTherefore, for the above, it can be seen that the structural approach to \nlanguage development in pre-school children hardly explains language \ndevelopment.\n\n\nThis is because the approach is too presumptuous in assuming that children only \nacquire language through imitation.\n\n\nIt fails to take into account the fact that the learner has to act on his \nenvironment in order to enable language learning to take place. \n\n\nThe functional/interactional approach, on the other hand, can explain a large \nportion of the development of language in pre-school children. \n\n\nFirstly, the approach is able to see the children as active, and not passive, \nlearners of language.\n\n\nThus, children will learn language in the way they think is right, using the \ndata they obtain from the environment to acquire their own knowledge of \nlanguage. \n\n\nBy seeing children as active learner of language, this theory is able to explain \n" errors" which children make in acquiring language. \n\n\nThese errors are seen as part of the natural learning process ( as children work \nout the grammar of language for themselves) and will cease to exist once the \nchildren have worked out the adult\'s grammar for themselves. \n\n\nAlso, the theory is able to explain how and why children acquire prosodic \nfeatures likes intonational patterns, stress patterns and pauses.\n\n\nChildren acquire these because they need to use them in communicating with their \nenvironment. \n\n\nThey acquire these features in the pre-linguistic stage. \n\n\nhere, children are already able to realise that there is a need for them to \ncommunicate even if they are not cognitively developed to use language to \ncommunicate as yet. \n\n\nThus, the functional approach explains children as first acquiring these \nintonational patterns to express their pragmatic intensions before using grammar \nto express the same intentions. \n\n\nThus, the approach is even able to explain the development of children in the \npre-linguistic stage.\n\n\nThis is important as communication does not begin at the linguistic stage. \n\n\nInstead, it begins from the moment the child is born. \n\n\nThus, because the functional/interactional approach explains that language is \nlearnt through communication, it has to look first at how communication takes \nplace prior to the time when language is used for communication ( in order to \nsee any connections between the pre-linguistic and linguistic stage).\n\n\nAlso, because the functional/interactional approach shows that children acquire \nlanguage through communication, it is able to explain how children not only \nacquire linguistic competence but are able to acquire the functional aspect of \nlanguage too ( leading to communication competence). \n\n\nThus, the theory is able to explain how children combine their knowledge of \nprosodic features with their linguistic knowledge to be able to produce language \nappropriately, according to the situations in which they occur. \n\n\nThus, in effect the theory is successful in explaining how language development \ndoes not start at the one-word stage, but actually starts in the pre-linguistic \nstage.\n\n\nThe functional/interactional approach by postulating that language learning \ncannot take place outside of the situations that give them meaning, are this \nalso able to explain that because children learn language in the context of \nsituation, they are thus able to use language according to the appropriate \nsituation, too. \n\n\nTherefore, from the above, it can be seen that the functional/interactional \napproach is able to explain language development to a large extent than the \nstructural approach can. \n\n\nThe functional/interactional approach is able to explain how children acquire \ncommunicative competence, as well as is able to ? \n\n\nup development in the pre-linguistic and linguistic stages. \n\n\nThe structural approach, on the other hand, is only able to explain a small \nexpect of the way in which children acquire linguistic structures. \n\n\nEven this small aspect of linguistic learning which it tries to explain is \nfaulted in many ways, as shown in the essay above. \n \n\n\nQ1 \n\n\nChildren, by the age of five, are believed to be fairly competent in their first \nlanguage.\n\n\nBy this time, children are believed to have already acquired the basic grammar \nof their first language. \n\n\nThis means that children have acquired linguistic competence in their first \nlanguage. \n\n\nThe aspects of this linguistic competence include phonological, morphological, \nsyntactic and semantic features.\n\n\nOne example of this linguistic development in children is the acquisition of the \nplural marker in English. \n\n\nAt first, children produce both the regular and irregular forms of the plural \nmarker ( because their speech is based mainly on imitation without comprehension \nat this stage). \n\n\nThis is followed by the next period where children learning English as a first \nlanguage realise that there is a regular plural marker rule governing words. \n\n\nThey thus overgeneralise the use of the regular marker to include even words \nwhich have irregular plural markings. \n\n\nOnly in the third stage do they finally learn the correct plural markings for \nwords.\n\n\nOn top of the acquisition of linguistic structures, children also acquire the \nability to use language as a means of communication with others. \n\n\nThey learn to use language to express their pragmatic intensions using \nintonational patterns, stress patterns and pauses. \n\n\nThey also make use of non-verbal gestures to communicate with others, too. \n\n\nAll these, in fact, already develop in the pre-linguistic stage ( prior to \nlanguage use).\n\n\nFor example, Gupta, in her data, shared that Ah Seng, while in the\npre-linguistic stage, screamed in order to show his insistence on going out with his \nbrother. \n\n\nThus, he was in fact using a primitive speech act ( in the form of the scream) \nto show his demand.\n\n\nThese pragmatic intensions, expressed through intonational patterns, later \nbecome lexicalised and then grammaticalised when children enter the linguistic \nstage. \n\n\nIn the linguistic stage, children do not merely utter a sentence out of context.\n\n\nInstead, it is uttered according to the context and each utterance indicates the \nintension of the speaker. \n\n\nTherefore, from the above, it can be seen that by the age of five, children have \nacquired communicative competence in their first language.\n\n\nThey are able to use language appropriately in appropriate contexts. \n\n\nOn top of this use of linguistic structure, they are able to use prosodic \nfeatures to help them in their communication with others. \n \n\n\nQ2 \n\n\nIn order to be able to compare the similarities and differences between \nmonolingual and bilingual development of preschool children, a distinction must \nfirst be made as to the different ways of acquisition of bilingualism. \n\n\nA\ndifference must be made between simultaneous and successive bilingualism. \n\n\nSimultaneous bilingualism is when children are exposed to two or more languages \nfrom birth whereas in successive bilingualism, a child is exposed to one \nlanguage first and then exposed to another when the first language is already \nestablished. \n\n\nThe similarities between monolingual and bilingual development in children is \nthat both sets of children will first acquire intonational and stress patterns \nprior to any acquisition of language. \n\n\nAlso, in the acquisition of the languages, both sets of children will also be \naided by a genetic program within them which makes them predisposed to acquiring\nlanguage. \n\n\nThey will also both have to make hypotheses as to the rules of the language(s) \nthey are learning. \n\n\nTo do this, they will both make use of an innately endored system which aids \nthem in acquiring language. \n\n\nMonolingual and bilingual children, if they are of the same age, will also be at \nthe same stage of cognitive development, which will determine their use of the \ninput they obtain. \n\n\nThe children will also both be dependent on caretakers\' speech to aid them in \nacquiring the \n\n\nrespective language(s) being learnt.  \n\n\nFrom studies done, it has also been found that children acquiring two languages \nsimultaneously learn both the languages at approximately the same pace as \nmonolingual children learning the same languages. \n\n\nThis finding was based on the syntactic structures, lexical growth and mean\nlength of utterances being acquired. \n\n\nOn top of this, children acquiring language simultaneously are believed to go \nthrough an initial mixed stage ( comprising both the languages being learnt).\n\n\nIn this stage, the child has only one lexicon but with words from both \nlanguages. \n\n\nThere are also no equivalents of words for words from both languages. \n\n\nIt is only after this stage that the child begins separating out the two\nlanguage systems. \n\n\nThis stage, of course is absent in monolingual children, because they are not \nfaced with two language systems.\n\n\nThere is also the possibility of children learning languages successively to \nface " interference" from the first language, especially if the first language \nis already well-entrenched.\n\n\nThis also is absent in the monolingual development in children. \n\n\nHowever, the basic difference between monolingual and bilingual development of \npre-school children is that the latter is faced with two, instead of one, \nlanguage system to sort out.\n\n\nThe ability of pre-school children to acquire more than one language ( as \nefficiently as monolingual children) clearly shows that the cognitive \ndevelopment in children at this early stage is already well-developed enough to \nsort out more than one language system.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ab493bb8-9a92-4d2d-9a74-27972a3c040f', 'added':

{'text': 'Q1 \n\n\nModern day psychology has\nbeen dominated by empirical research at the expense of conceptual\ninvestigation. \n\n\nPsychology, especially clinical\npsychology, is characterised by research for empirical data.\n\n\nIt will be argued that empirical concerns and\nconceptual issues play equally important roles in the psychological\nexplanation of human behaviour. \n\n\nA psychological\ninvestigation using empirical research is concerned with studying actual\ncases of phenomenon. \n\n\nIt is in this yield that\npsychologists observed real cases of human behaviour or mental states and\nthen, proceed by making generalizations about the regularities observed.\n\n\nHowever, Ryau claims that when researchers fail to\nobtain results in their studies, they tend to examine the conceptual issues\ninvolved. \n\n\nIn a qualified sense, all empirical research\nis dependent upon conceptual clarification. \n\n\nBefore\nempirical research can be conducted, the researchers have to conceptualize\nthe problem they intend to study. \n\n\nWithout meticulous\nconceptualization, one may not even know what one is looking for in the\nempirical study. \n\n\nHence, conceptualization takes place\nfirst. \n\n\nThis is where the researchers define the\nproblem, state what exactly they are looking for and determine the criteria\nby which they use words. \n\n\nHaving done\nconceptualization, the researchers can then go on to operationalize these\nconcepts and use them for the empirical study. \n\n\n\nConceptual issues in psychology serve to set the logical limits of\npossibility or impossibility. \n\n\nEmpirical concerns look\nwithin these limits to observe regularities which may then be generalized.\n\n\nConceptual questions are not factual questions; they\nare second-order questions about a discipline. \n\n\n\nConceptual questions ask " How is this possible?" \n\n\n\nEmpirical questions ask " How does this happen?" \n\n\n\nConceptual clarification may lead to conceptual illumination.\n\n\nExamining concepts within psychology and the criteria\nby which we use terms and concepts may result in a radical new way we look at\nold problems. \n\n\nit has been claimed that scientific\nprogress was possible only because of the solving of many conceptual puzzles.\n\n\nPhysics and other natural sciences have advanced\ngreatly because of the concomitant advances made in the conceptual\nclarification of their respective fields. \n\n\nHowever, the\nconcepts of psychology have not advanced as much as those in the natural\nsciences. \n\n\nHence, philosophers, who are trained to\nthink at a level of abstractness not required in empirical psychology, feel\nthat they can make an important contribution to the field of psychology.\n\n\nThe result of philosophical investigation and inquiry\ninto the conceptual issues of psychology may be extremely fruitful.\n\n\nGilbert Ryle has claimed that there is no need for\nempirical research in studying human behaviour. \n\n\nAll we\nneed to do is to do philosophical investigation. \n\n\nThis\nhowever, is quite a radical view. \n\n\nI would like to\nargue that just as psychology would be impoverished by lack of concern for\nconceptual issues, it would be equally impoverished by lack of empirical\ndata. \n\n\nWhat then, is the role of empirical data?\n\n\nSome researchers start their research by empirical\nobservation. \n\n\nHaving observed regularities in the\nphenomena, they generalise the regularities and then, generate theories.\n\n\nThis form of research can be fruitful because it may\nbring to light previously unknown regularities. \n\n\nThe\ngeneration of theory is based on empirical concerns. \n\n\n\nHowever, even if research is based on priori conceptualization, empirical\nconcerns do play a major role. \n\n\nHaving clarified\nconcepts and set logical possibilities and impossibilities, researchers can\nuse empirical data to verify their theories or hypotheses.\n\n\nEmpirical data can prove or disprove hypotheses.\n\n\nA philosopher acquainted with empirical data from\npsychology would be able to develop a richer and more substantive\nunderstanding of the issues involved. \n\n\nOne could say\nthat empirical concerns and conceptual issues can have mutual interaction.\n\n\nA combination of both empirical concerns of conceptual\nissues would result in a more substantive and comprehensive psychology.\n\n\nConceptual issues or empirical concerns alone may be\nable to explain only limited domains. \n\n\nHowever, a\ncombination and interaction of both results in greater progress.\n\n\nConceptual issues may tell us what to look for and\nwhat is possible or not. \n\n\nEmpirical concerns would then\nverify or disprove conceptual hypotheses. \n\n\nThis would\nforce one to reexamine the conceptual issues and so on.\n\n\nIn this manner, the interaction between empirical\nconcerns and conceptual issues is a dynamic one which may result in a richer\npsychology. \n\n\nThe explanatory powers of conceptual\nissues and empirical concerns on their own is limited. \n\n\n\nA synthesis of both would be more enriched. \n\n\nIn the\nfield of psychology, it is not the case of " old wine in new bottles", as has\nbeen claimed by Ned Block. \n\n\nPerhaps this is most\nevident in the study of emotions. \n\n\nIn the study of\nemotions, conceptual issues and empirical concerns can be used to develop\ngreater understanding. \n\n\nBY its own nature, the study of\nemotions lends itself to the mutual interaction between the conceptual and\nthe empirical. \n\n\nThis is because physiology and\ncognition etc. \n\n\ncan be studied either conceptually or\nempirically; even both. \n\n\nPerhaps with greater\ninteraction between conceptual issues and empirical concerns, we may be able\nto see the discipline of psychology making greater progress.\n\n\nPsychological studies are such that they are so\nclosely related to the " heartland" of folk psychology and issues of the mind\nstudied by philosophers. \n\n\nPsychology and philosophy are\nintimately related; the issues examined are relatively similar.\n\n\nHence, there should not be a bias towards either\nconceptual or empirical research, a combination of both would be more\nenriching. \n\n \n\n\nQ2 \n\n\nLyons\' cognitive theory\nof emotions comprise the cognitive, evaluative and appetitive aspects.\n\n\nGenerally, a cognitive theory is one which makes some\naspect of thought, usually a belief, central to emotions.\n\n\nAccording to Lyons, cognitions or judgement are first\nmade before we undergo an emotion. \n\n\nCognition is\ntherefore, a judgement or belief about something or some property of the\nobject of thought. \n\n\nLyons points out that even a false\nbelief or judgement may give rise to an emotion. \n\n\nFor\nexample, I may have stepped into a room and felt fear when I saw a coil of\nrope because I had mistakenly believed that the coil of rope was a huge\nsnake. \n\n\nBesides, cognition may not even be beliefs or\njudgements about unique properties of the object of thought.\n\n\nHowever, Lyons claims that cognition alone does not\ngive rise to emotions, we need the evaluative aspect. \n\n\n\nSeeing a bomb in the room does not make me afraid. \n\n\n\nWhat makes me afraid is my evaluation that the bomb is harmful and could\npossibly kill me. \n\n\nLyons asserted that physiological\nchanges cannot differentiate between emotions. \n\n\nBy a\nprocess of elimination, he endorses the view that it is the evaluative aspect\nthat distinguishes one emotion from another. \n\n\nHaving\neliminated physiology, Lyons claims that cognition does not fit the bill\neither. \n\n\nThe reason being that different cognitions may\ngive rise to the same emotion and different emotions can be generated by the\nsame cognition. \n\n\nFurthermore, the appetitive apect of\nemotions is derivative from the evaluative aspect. \n\n\n\nHence, I desire or want something because I evaluate the situation og having\nthat something as good. \n\n\nLyons concludes then, that we\nare left with the evaluative aspect to distinguish between emotions.\n\n\nAccording to Lyons, the evaluative aspect may take the\nform of either an objective evaluation or a subjective appraisal.\n\n\nLyons also claimed that although some emotions may\nhave no appetitive aspect, in some cases we may have to appeal to the\nappetitive aspect to distinguish between emotions. \n\n\n\nHence, Lyons\' main thesis is that the cognitive theory of emotions, which\ninclude the cognitive, evaluative and appetitive aspects, provides a coherent\naccount of emotions in general. \n\n\nLyons\' theory of\nemotions can be criticised on several counts. \n\n\nOne of\nthe main criticisms is that the cognitive theory cannot explain " objectless"\nemotions. \n\n\nFor example, when I step into a dark room, I\nfeel fear, but there is no object of fear. \n\n\nI believe\nthat Lyons can explain this type of emotion. \n\n\nLyons\nasserts that in this case, the object may not be properly formulated or\nexpressed. \n\n\nI feel fear simply because I have a vague\nsense of foreboding. \n\n\nHence, the object of my fear may\nbe the lack of knowledge that I possess about the situation or even the\nsituation itself. \n\n\nHence, in a certain sense, my fear\nis directed towards an " object", however vague, unformulated or unexpressed.\n\n\nThe second criticism against Lyons is that he cannot\nexpalin pre-reflexive, instantaneous or Pavlovian emotions.\n\n\nThese emotions seem to occur without the evaluation\ntaking place. \n\n\nLyons\' reply to this criticism would be\nthat occurent emotions do not stand in need of occurent evaluations.\n\n\nIn the context of emotions, evaluations can be given a\ndispositional analysis. \n\n\nThe first time I undergo an\nemotion, I make the evaluation that is required. \n\n\nAs I\ncontinue to undergo the same emotion, the same evaluation becomes reinforced.\n\n\nEventually, the evaluations once made, become\nreinforced and then embedded. \n\n\nThis would result in my\nhaving a tendency or disposition to act in a certain manner and undergo a\ncertain emotion when similar circumstances arise. \n\n\nIn\nthis sense, occurent emotions need not involve occurent evaluations.\n\n\nThe third criticism against Lyons\' theory is that it\ncannot explain emotions that are based on wishes and desires.\n\n\nLyons may be able to explain this.\n\n\nHe asserted that desires and wishes are derivative of\nevaluations. \n\n\nHence, whatever I desire seems to be\ndependent on how I evaluate it. \n\n\nA critic may claim\nthat grief over the loss of a loved one occurs even though we know that the\ndead cannot be brought back to life. \n\n\nThis is a case\nof an emotion that arose of out conflicting beliefs; or rather, out of a\nbelief even though we know that the situation can not be attained.\n\n\nIn reply, Lyons can claim that the evaluation that I\nwish the dead person was alive does not fully capture everything.\n\n\nThe reason why I desire or want/wish that the dead\nperson was not dead is because I evaluate the situation of the person\' death\nas a bad situation. \n\n\nThere is nothing irrational or\nillogical about this. \n\n\nBesides, wishing that the dead\nperson was alive does not entail doing anything to bring it about that the\nperson is alive. \n\n\nThe final criticism I would like to\nexamine is irrational emotions. \n\n\nFor example, someone\nmay fear lizards even though she believes that lizards are not harmful.\n\n\nAccording to Picher, we cannot criticise this sort of\nemotion as irrational. \n\n\nLyons\' theory allow not only\nfor objective evaluation but for subjective apparaisals as well.\n\n\nPitcher claims that subjective emotions such as fear\nor hate are basically a matter of taste. \n\n\nWe cannot\ncriticise this as being irrational because a subjective appraisal, being\nsubjective, is not subjected to norms and is traws or a-rational.\n\n\nHence, there is no question of irrationality here.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Lyons\' cognitive theory of occurent\nemotions seems quite comprehensive. \n\n\nIt is able to\nanswer the criticisms mentioned. \n\n\nHowever, if the\ntheory were to be combined with a physiological theory, it would be more\npowerful. \n\n\nThe cognitive-evaluative-appetitive\naspects of this theory captures the essence of the theory.\n\n\nIt is mainly the evaluative aspect and sometimes the\nappetitive aspect that distinguishes one emotion from another. \n\n \n\n\nQ6 \n\n\n( i)In his work A\nProject for a Scientific Psychology, Freud endorses a view of type-type\nidentity between mental a physical states. \n\n\nLater on,\nFreud asserted that mental entities cannot be reduced to mere physical\nentities. \n\n\nPerhaps he was influenced by Brentano who\nclaimed that all mental entities were intentional entities.\n\n\nHence, Freud recognized that mental states cannot be\nreduced to physical ones. \n\n\nAn eliminative\nreductionist\'s stand is an incoherent one. \n\n\nIf we ask\nan eliminationist whether he believed in reductionism, he cannot give an\nanswer. \n\n\nIf he says " Yes", then we can point out that\nhe still has to appeal to the notion of a belief. \n\n\nIf\nhe says " No", then we do not have to take him seriously.\n\n\nIt has been claimed that Freud held a neutral\nposition with regard to psycho-physical parralellism. \n\n\n\nI believe that Freud had to be some sort of dualist; and believe in the\ninteraction between the mental and the physical. \n\n\nIf\nFreud was not a dualist in some sense, how is it possible that mental states\ncan affect physical behaviour?', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd8920bd1-f3a0-4524-9e1c-b4ffef1c9721', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.636016+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9607467651367188, 'non_english_score': 0.03925323486328125}
{'text': 'Q1 \n\n\nTo understand what King\nZi\'s view on what it is to be human, it is imperative to first understand his\nview concerning " what is more in human life than meets the eye".\n\n\nAlthough it is undeniable that King Zi does not discuss\nabout " strange phenomena, violence, chaos and gods", King Zi does have a\nreligious conviction about " what is more". \n\n\nHe\nuncritically accept the traditional idea that Tian, or heaven, is the source\nof all things, including human culture. \n\n\nTian is\nintrinsically benevolent; Tian cares for the people. \n\n\n\nKing Zi declares that \'Tian produced the te ( virtue) in me\'.\n\n\nIn other words, te is the personal presence of Tian\nwithin. \n\n\nOriginally te was regarded as a inborn capacity\npossessed by the rulers and shamans through which the behaviours of others\ncould be influenced. \n\n\nBut King Zi innovatively proclaims\nthat everybody, both rulers and commoners, has this te endowed by Tian and\nhence, everyone has the both the capacity and responsibility to cultivate\nbenevolence as Tian is benevolent. \n\n\nAs such, King Zi\nthinks that to be human is to be a man of benevolence or as he calls it, a\nnoble man ( in Mandarin). \n\n\nAnother metaphysical or\nreligious conviction integral to King Xi\'s worldview is the metaphor of\nfamily. \n\n\nKing Xi, as a transmitter of ancient heritage,\nbelieves that the whole world and all there is within, consist of a big\nfamily. \n\n\nTian is reminiscent to the more ancient notion\nof Shan Ti ( collective presence of ancestral spirits) and Tian cares for the\npeople. \n\n\nThe emperor as the son of Tian is charged with\nthe parenting role to take care of the people. \n\n\nSo,\nanother way fo conceiving of being human is, for King Xi, to be a responsible\nfamily member. \n\n\nTo be a man of benevolence and to be a\nfamily member are two sides of the same coin. \n\n\n\nBenevolence is an existential goal and it refers to the perfection of human\nexcellence. \n\n\nEveryone is endowed by Tian the capacity\nto engage in ethical cultivation but everyone is not therefore automatically\nman of benevolence. \n\n\nEfforts, will, decision are all\nneeded to be invoked to make the inborn capacity or moral sensibility to\nflourish and attain human perfection or benevolence. \n\n\n\nThe root of benevolence is Xiao ( filial piety). \n\n\nThis\nordered family affection is a natural impulse. \n\n\nWhen\nthis impulse is consciously developed and cultivated, it has the potential to\ndevelop into Jen ( benevolence). \n\n\nHowever, beside this\nnatural impulse. \n\n\nthere are other selfish impluse, if\nunchecked, might impede the extension and development of the natural\naffection of Xiao. \n\n\nSo, discipline, effort and constant\nchoice are all indispensable ingredients in the process of ethical\ncultivation. \n\n\nIt is interesting to note that King Xi\nbelieve that the records of the way of the ancient sage king provides the\nblueprint of how heaven ( Tian) live and more in this world.\n\n\nThrough the ancient record, we can see that the\nchou-li ( Rites) are the crystalisations of Tian\'s way which means that the\nformer sage king had somehow comprehended Tian\'s way and codified it.\n\n\nSince Li is the blue-print of how Tian moves and lives\nin this world, to revive the former way of the ancient sage king or rather,\nto order the kingdom according to Tian\'s way, all that is needed is to\nperform the rites according to the proper inner ethical attitudes or spirit.\n\n\nHowever the ancient rites are not comprehensive\nenough, and I wonder it would ever be, to provide definitive guidance to\nevery daily mundane decision. \n\n\nThis is where conscious\nrational thought come in. \n\n\nKing Xi thinks that it is\nimperative for every human to put the interest of the whole above the self\nand do what is appropriate ( Mandarin word). \n\n\nAccording\nto King Xi, an individual\'s greatest responsibility, as Lao Szu King rightly\nperceives, is not on one\'s success and failures which are determined by Ming\n( Heaven\'s decree) but on ethical cultivation. \n\n\nKing Zi\nunapologetically assumes that what distinguishes man from all other things is\nman\'s inborn capacity to engage in ethical cultivation and it is only\nappropriate ( or human) to devote one\'s whole life\'s energies in ethical\ncultivation. \n\n\nLao Zi would not dispute that the natural\norder, which he calls Tao, while King Xi calls Tian, is inherently good.\n\n\nHe also would concur that we should respect the way of\nthe former sage king. \n\n\nBut he disagree that man\'s\ngreatest responsibility is to engage in ethical cultivation.\n\n\nHe thinks that man\'s greatest responsibility is to\nreturn to the Tao and the way to do it is to employ " non action" - actions\nwithout effort. \n\n\nI hasten to add that although Tao\nTzu\'s conception of " how" to cultivate or perfect our being human is\ndifferent from King Xi, both converge on the point that human should live and\nmove in the way of the natural order. \n\n\nTao Tzu also\ndiffers in his view concerning Li ( rites). \n\n\nHe accepts\nthe way of the former sage king but he is sceptical about the claim that it\ncan be codified. \n\n\nHe regards the performance of Li not\nas irrelevant but even as contrary to the interests of being human.\n\n\nFurthermore, while King Xi encourages conscious\nrational thought in discriminating the good from the bad, he asserts that one\nshould make no distinction and cease the wavering mind from having cognitive\nfunctions. \n\n\nAs for a Chan buddhist, he would think that\nethical cultivation is a mere tool to prepare one to " see into one\'s buddha\ndirectly" and obviously, he would say that this is just a secondary\nresponsibility. \n\n\nFor a Chan, the greatest\nresponsibility of man is to attain enlightenment which is also the\nextinguishing of selfish desires. \n\n\nThe second part of\nthe above discussion focuses mainly on the differences of the conceptions of\nhow to perfect our being human according to the 3 perspectives.\n\n\nIt does not mean that they have no similarity at all.\n\n\nOne salient similarity is the common believe that one\nneeds to put the interests of the whole, whether conceived of as Tian, Tao or\nSELF ( the ultimate reality), above self and not to give free reign to\nselfish and debased desires. \n\n \n\n\nQ2 ( Section B) \n\n\nKing Zi\nregards himself as a transmitter of ancient heritage and not an innovator.\n\n\nIn this essay, I will elucidate the content of the\nancient heritage, he transmits and the way in which he has contributed his\ninnovative insights in this interpretations of the ancient heritage.\n\n\nKing Zi is a Ru scholar. \n\n\nAs a\nru, he is well versed in the records of ancient heritage which consist\nmainly, though not solely, of ancient rites and historical facts.\n\n\nHe is convinced that the reason why the former sage\nkings like Yao ( Mandarin) and Shun ( Mandarin) had brought peace and harmony\nto the kingdoms was because they had somehow grasped the way of Tian; they\nhad codified the way of Tian and came out with a comprehensive set of rites\nwhich mirror how Tian moves and lives in this world. \n\n\n\nSince this rites have a metaphysical origin, they are natural in the sense it\nhas the power to humanize and shape those who participate in it, and not\nartificial. \n\n\nThis is perhaps why Figarate calls these\nholy rites or sacred ceremonies. \n\n\nit is possible to\nargue that what is innovative about King Zi\'s view is that he asserts that it\nis only through the cultivation of Jen that would infuse the performance of\nLi with the required spirit and through which, the Li would be enlivened and\nas a result, could radiate its spiritual power and bring peace and harmony to\nthe land. \n\n\nHowever, as Benjamin Schwartz succinctly\npoints out that even in some of the preconfucian texts, the idea of " te"\nwith an ethical connotation was already present. \n\n\n" Te"\noriginally was believed to be a inborn capacity of the ruler.\n\n\nIf a ruler through ethical choice and effort makes his\n" te" illustrious, then he would be able to receive the mandate to rule from\nheaven. \n\n\nSo, it is evident that even before confucian,\nthere was already the belief that the performance of Li, especially by the\nruler, needs to be accompanied with the proper inner ethical attitude and\nspirit. \n\n\nWhat is new about King Zi\'s idea, is that he\nextends the privilege of ethical cultivation and the potential of achieving\nethical perfection to the commoners. \n\n\nBefore him, it\nwas thought that " te" is the exclusive privilege of the members of the\nruling clan. \n\n\nBut King Zi audaciously assert that\neveryone can be a man of benevolence and everyone has the inborn capacity and\nresponsibility to engage in ethical cultivation. \n\n\nIn\nfact, the notion of " noble man" ( in Mandarin) denotes only the sons of\nrulers, but King Xi converts it into an ethical notion, that represent an\nethical ideal of human excellence of which all man should strive for.\n\n\nAnother credit that King Xi deserves is that he gives\nthe most detail teachings of how to cultivate Jen, even until today.\n\n\nDespite the fact that he gives no single exhaustive\ndefinition to explicate Jen, he produces different numerations of how Jen\nshould be practiced in different specific contexts. \n\n\nIn\nmy opinion, King Xi greatest contribution lies with his careful and in-depth\nteaching of how to practice Jen. \n\n\nIt is noteworthy that\nKing Xi\'s notion of Jen is also new and yet continuous with what came before.\n\n\nProfessor Lin Yu Sheng notes that the word " Jen"\nalready appears in " The book of poetry" which, perhaps means " true\nmanhood". \n\n\nWhat is unmistakable is that " Jen"\noriginally refers only a particular virtue. \n\n\nBut in\nKing Xi\'s hands, he extends its meanings to encompass all particular virtues.\n\n\nAs a result, for King Xi, Jen is a notion denoting the\nultimate perfection of human excellence. \n\n\nAs Schwartz\nobserves, Jen became an existential goal that one should constanyl strive for\nthough it seems that one never reaches. \n\n\nI am aware\nthat there are those who thinks that King Xi\'s greatest innovation is his\nconception of Xi and Fingarette is a case in point. \n\n\nIn\nmy view, this is factually erroneous. \n\n\nIn the first\nplace, in King Xi\'s time, though there were neglect and misapplication of Li,\nyet it is undeniable that on the whole, Li was still widely practiced since\nit is part of the ancient Chinese culture. \n\n\nAs Schwartz\nargues, King Xi expresses concern only when there is " a discrepancy" between\nthe form and the spirit of Li. \n\n\nMoreover, as Waley\nrightly discerns the Analects do not focus on the details of Li but if is a\nbook which primarily focused on " the general principles of moralities".\n\n\nIn conclusion, what is new and yet continuous with\nwhat came before is King Xi\'s ideas that everybody has the capacity to\ncultivate Jen and it is through the cultivation of Jen that Li could be\nenliven. \n\n\nWhen Li is enliven, the former way of the\nancient sage king would be revived and its spiritual force would be unleased.\n\n\nWithout the accompaniment of Jen, Li would degenerate\ninto empty forms and this is what King Xi adhors. \n\n \n\n\nQ6 \n\n\nA perfect man has no\nname, no achievement and no use. \n\n\nA perfect man has no\nname because the Tao, the ultimate reality that the perfect man gain mystical\nunion with, has no name. \n\n\nNames are used to refer to a\nparticular thing or characteristic but the Tao is all-embracing.\n\n\nIt is in everything and everything is in the Tao.\n\n\nA perfect man has no achievement because like the Tao,\nhe claims no credit for himself. \n\n\nHe has no use or to\nbe specific, he is useless because he does not confine and subject himself to\nthe artificial norms and man made standards. \n\n\nA perfect\nman is also one who is not found by human limitations. \n\n\n\nHe could roam about in the universe and ride on the " normalities of the six\nelements". \n\n\nHe is free and eternally happy.\n\n\nUnplagued by negative human emotions, he has no wordly\nworries and cares. \n\n\nBut what must one do to become a\nperfect man?  \n\n\nZhuang Zi tells us: fast the mind.\n\n\nHow? \n\n\nTranscend all finite\npoints of view. \n\n\nMake no distinction.\n\n\nDon\'t affirm this or negate that for all is relative.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source':

{'text': 'Q7 \n\n\n Introduction \n\n\nWith Kuhn, the denise of Foundationalism became\nevident. \n\n\nKuhn\'s distinction between normal science &\nrevolutionary science has brought the problem of incommensurability to the\nsurface. \n\n\nNormal science is a paradigm-directed\nactivity. \n\n\nAnd so, there is kind of foundation within\nthe normal science constituted by the adherence to shared data, standards,\nmeanings and even worlds. \n\n\nHence, there is little\nambiguity and problem in comparing different theories that attempt to\narticulate the paradigm in different directions. \n\n\nSo, if all science were normal science, then the problem of\nincommensurability would not arise. \n\n\nHowever Kuhn also discovered another period\nof science which he calls revolutionary science. \n\n\nThis period is characterised by proliferation of theories. \n\n\nAnd since theories bring their own data, standards, & facts, so there is no\nlonger any common foundation. \n\n\nThe foundation which we\nhad during normal science is only a paradigm - relative one.\n\n\nBesides, meaning holism also entails that theories\ncannot communicate. \n\n\nSo confronted with this problem of\nincommensurability, Churchland proposes his semantic theory as a means of\nbridging the gap between theories so that they need not be regarded as\nabsolutely incommensurable. \n\n\n Churchland\'s semantic & systemic sentences  \n\n\nChurchland distinguishes\nbetween 2 kinds of sentences namely systemically and semantically important\nsentences in an individual\'s T-set. \n\n\nAn individual\'s T-set is the set of all sentences containing the term, say T,\nthat he accepts. \n\n\nOut of this T-set, there is likely to be a\nsubset of sentences which are more theoretically important sentences.\n\n\nThese define the individual\'s understanding of the\nterm, T. \n\n\nAs such, any changes in the set of\nsystemically important sentences would have tremendous impact on the belief\nsystem of the individual. \n\n\nAny variation in\nunderstanding would necessitate an extensive readjustment and revision of the\nbelief system that he holds. \n\n\nThe semantically\nimportant sentences are those which define the meaning of a term.\n\n\nThey are those on whose acceptance, the smoothness and\nefficiency of one\'s verbal commerce in a linguistic community is maximally\ndependent. \n\n\nThis is because shared meaning depends on\nthe sharing of these sentences more than it depends on others.\n\n\nThese sentences form the baseline of a linguistic\ncommunity. \n\n\nThey are the common framework that one\nspeaker expects to find in another. \n\n\nDoes Churchland\'s\ntheory enable us to circumvent the problem of incommensurability?\n\n\nChurchland accepts the thesis of holism.\n\n\nHowever, his theory is able to overcome the problem of\nincommensurability because his theory allows for a kind of non-foundational\nepistemology. \n\n\nSince menaing is social and\nunderstanding is private, the commensurability between paradigms depend on\nthe sharing of the semantically more important sentences.\n\n\nAccording to Churchland, 2 paradigms, say the\nNewtonians and the Einsteinians can communicate with each other because the\nhave the same meaning. \n\n\nA term has the same meaning for\n2 speakers if the set of their semantically important sentences containing\nthis term has the same membership. \n\n\nHowever, there may\nbe cases where there is no perfect match between their set of semantically\nimportant sentences. \n\n\nThey may disagree about the\nsemantic status of some sentences. \n\n\nIn this case,\nChurchland would attest that communication need not be terminated.\n\n\nThe speakers can fall on the extensive substructure of\nmeaning that remains shared between them and approach the problematic topic\nanew. \n\n\nIf this discussion is successful, then the\ndisputed sentences may get thrown out either by one speaker being is on over\nto the semantic status of the other or by the agreement on both parties to\ncome to a compromise structure in the course of the debate.\n\n\nHence, this shows that perfect correspondence of set\nof semantically important sentences is not a necessary condition for\ncommensurability. \n\n\nAnd its absence is of no practical\nsifnificance. \n\n\nThe conflicting paradigms can still\ncommunicate with each other with untroubled fluency. \n\n\nThis shows that on Churchland\'s theory, commensurability and meaning\nsolipsism ( whereby terms lose its meaning once taken out of the context of\nthe paradigm) is less dramatic. \n\n\nIt becomes merely a\nmatter of degree, ranging from negligible ( where their set of semantically\nimpt sentences almost perfectly coincide) to unbridgeable ( where there is no\nshared semantically important sentences at all as in the case of violently\nconflicting paradigms.) \n\n\nHence, this shows that\nalthough Churchland accepts the thesis of theory ladenness, his theory is\nable to avoid radical holism. \n\n\nMeaning depends on the\nsharing of the subset of semantically important sentences and not by the set\nof all accepted sentences. \n\n\nHence, his theory is, so to\nspeak, quasi holistic. \n\n\nHowever, Churchland\'s theory is\nunique because there could still be epistemology even in the absence of an\nabsolute found. \n\n\nThe semantically important sentences\ncommon in both paradigm\'s T-set could act as a " foundation", on the basis of\nwhich their differences can be approached and arbitrated.\n\n\nHowever, it is not a permanent, natural foundation\nwhich is independent of both paradigms. \n\n\nInstead, it is\nonly an artificially forged foundation from the 2 frameworks in conflict.\n\n\nHence, the above account of Churchland\'s theory shows\nthat the problem of incommensurability is not so severe as to cut off any\ncommunication link between paradigms. \n\n\nParadigms can\nstill communicate and be compared. \n\n\nSo the nature of\nscientific progress need not be rejected as irrational.\n\n\n Conclusion  \n\n\nHowever,\ndespite its ability to circumvent the problem of incommensurability,\nChurchland\'s theory does not seem to give a realistic portrayal of the way we\ndo science. \n\n\nThe process of listing all relevant\nsentences and thereafter sorting them into semantically and systemically\nimportant ones seem like a tedious chore and is not very practical.\n\n\nBesides, Chruchland\'s account is too simplistic.\n\n\nReal life situations may be more complicated & hence\nmore problematic. \n\n\nThere may be cases where there is\njust simply no insolvable substructure genuinely shared between the paradigms\nthat can act as a basis which allows for their commensurability.\n\n\nHence, although Churchland\'s theory can avoid the\nproblem of incommensurability between similar paradigms, his theory becomes\nquestionable in the face of violently conflicting paradigms. \n \n\n\nQ2 \n\n\n Introduction \n\n\nAccording to Kemery, there is one method through which\nall scientific theories go through in their development.\n\n\nAnd He calls this method the methodological cycle.\n\n\nThe peculiarity of this cycle is that " science must\nstart from facts and end with facts". \n\n\nWithin this\ncycle, two processes can be distinguished. \n\n\nThey are:-\n\n\n( i)the formation of possible theories which comes\nunder the context of discovery and \n\n\n( ii) the selection\nof one of these, falling under the context of justification.\n\n\nIn this essay, I shall deal with each of these in\nturn. \n\n\nContext of Discovery Kemery places a high degree\nof importance to the role of observation or induction the formation of\ntheories. \n\n\nInduction is the process of forming theories\non the basis of a set of facts. \n\n\nIt involves going from\nparticular statements to a general conclusion . \n\n\nFor\nexample, after watching the sun for several days, the scientist concludes:-\n\n\n( i)The sun rises in the east for the past hundred\ndays. \n\n\n( a collection of facts) \n\n\n( ii) ( therefore in mathematical symbol) the sun rises in the east everyday\n( a theory). \n\n\nSo this is the process of induction which\nKemery states that all scientific theories go through. \n\n\nThis is the job of an empirical scientist. \n\n\nThe\nempirical scientist performs experiments which allows him to make controlled\nand meticulous observation of nature. \n\n\nHe then collects\nfacts from his experiments and these facts constitute his observation\nreports. \n\n\nAs more and more facts are collected, general\nfeatures become discernible. \n\n\nHowever, a collection of\nfacts does not constitute a science. \n\n\nFrom collection\nof facts, the scientist must make a conception of the world.\n\n\nHe then ( the theoretical scientist) formulate a\ntheory and atttempt to fit the theory into the discernible features ( the\nknown facts). \n\n\nHence, the above describes the process\nof formation of theories. \n\n\nKemery\'s account of the\ndiscovery of theories is a neat, safe and cautious account ( ie through the\ninductive method) unlike that proposed by Pepper ( ie through the method of\nputting forth bold hypothesis and daring conjectures unconstrained by data).\n\n\n Context of Justification \n\n\nHowever, after the forming of theories, the scientist\nmust test his theory to see if they accord with facts. \n\n\nThis step is necessary because given a set of facts, there are many theories\nwhich could equally well explain the same collection of data.\n\n\nSo how do we know which of these theories to accept?\n\n\nHence, the need to justify them.\n\n\nKemery proposes the criterion of credibility to test\ntheories. \n\n\nBut one cannot just test a theory against\nfacts. \n\n\nTheoretical statements are general statements\nwhile factual statements are particular. \n\n\nOne cannot\ntest that the sun rises everyday. \n\n\nWhat one does test\nis that it rose yesterday, it rises today and will rise tomorrow.\n\n\nHence, the scientist must reduce his theory to\nparticular statements and he does this through the process of deduction which\nis a purely logical process. \n\n\nFor example, the\nscientist deduces:- \n\n\n( i)the sun rises in the east\neveryday " ( a theory) \n\n\n( ii) ( therefore in\nmathematical symbol) the sun will rise in the east tomorrow ( a prediction).\n\n\nHence, it is the logical consequence of the theory or\nits prediction that the scientist later goes on to test.\n\n\nAccording to Kemery, one test a theory by again\nlooking at facts. \n\n\nBut now, one looks for more\nsupportive evidence to confirm the theory. \n\n\nThe more\nfacts or evidence one can gather from nature to support the theory, the more\nverified the theory becomes and hence, the more credible it is.\n\n\nThis is the case if the prediction that the theory\ngenerates accord with facts. \n\n\nBut what happens when\nthe predictions do not agree with subsequent observations?\n\n\nKemery says that theories need not be rejected\nimmediately if their predictions do not get verifies. \n\n\nThis is because when one makes a prediction, one does not do it on the basis\nof this theory alone but together with other auxiliary theories.\n\n\nhence, it is not clear which of these 2 theories (\nthe theory under test or the auxiliary theories) are at fault.\n\n\nHence, what one should do is to try to modify one\'s\nauxiliary theories and not reject one\'s theory immediately.\n\n\nHowever, even if one\'s theory gets verified all the\ntime, this does not mean that the theory is proven certain.\n\n\nThis is because given a theory there are numerous\npredictions that can be made. \n\n\nSo however many\npredictions one test, one has not tested all of them. \n\n\nSo the implication is that one\'s theory only becomes more probable the more\nverifications it gets but never proven true. \n\n\nAnd, the\nmore verifications it gets, the more probable it becomes and one has then\ndiscovered a new law. \n\n\nSome criticisms against\nKemery\'s method. \n\n\nLike other theories, Kemery\'s\nmethodological cycle is also not free from criticisms.\n\n\nThe most severe criticism of his methodology comes\nfrom Popper. \n\n\nPopper criticises both of Kemery\'s\naccount of the formation and justification of theories.\n\n\nWith regards to the formation of theories, Popper\nasserts that if science should follow such an inductive method, it will\nbecome merely an irrational enterprise. \n\n\nPopper\naccepts Hume\'s criticism of the inductive method. \n\n\nHume claims that one can never justify the inductive method.\n\n\nInduction is an invalid process because it is based\non an unjustified belief that nature is ordered and uniform.\n\n\nHowever, according to Hume, there is no guarantee\nthat just because nature has been uniformly functioning in the past, it will\ncontinue to do so always. \n\n\nSuch a claim cannot be\nempirically justified. \n\n\nSo Popper regards this method\nas a pseudo-empirical one. \n\n\nPopper even rejects Hume\'s\nargument that although we cannot give a logical account of induction, we can\njustify our employment of this method on the basis of habit and custom.\n\n\nBut Popper disagrees with this argument because of\nscience is undercut, leading to a scepticism about scientific knowledge.\n\n\nHence Kemery\'s methodological cycle has a weak and\nillegitimate link ( ie induction). \n\n\nBesides, Popper\nalso disagrees with Kemery\'s method of starting with the collection of facts.\n\n\nThis is because he asserts that there are infinity of\nfacts that can be collected but surely not all of these are relevant in the\nformation of a particular theory.  \n\n\nPopper thinks\nthat there is no such thing as " pure" observation. \n\n\nObservation is always theory-directed. \n\n\nIt is like a\nbeam of light which searches. \n\n\nIt searches for\nrelevant facts. \n\n\nBut to search for relevant facts we\nneed the guidance of a theory itself. \n\n\nhence Popper\nthinks that there is an inevitable vicious circle in Kemery\'s methodological\ncycle. \n\n\nAnd if science were to go through this cycle,\nthen science will never get off the ground at all. \n\n\n\nAs for Kemery\'s account of the method of justifying theories, Popper thinks\nthat the verification criterion is not a good criterion.\n\n\nThis is because he claims that if we use\nverification as the criterion of demarcating scientific from\npseudo-scientific theories, then there would be no ground for denying\nFreudian psychoanalysis, Marxist theory and astrology from the status of a\nscience. \n\n\nThese theories do get verifications all the\ntime. \n\n\nHowever, Popper argues that it is easy to find\nverifications if one looks for them. \n\n\nThe world is\nfull of verifications for nearly every theory. \n\n\nHence, verification cannot be the criterion of science.\n\n\nThe confirming instances that we find to support the\ntheory proves nothing except that the observation report can be interpreted\nin the light of the theory. \n\n\nKemery\'s verification\nmethod does not give any condition under which the scientist is willing to\ngive up the theory. \n\n\nAnd this is characteristic of\nthe other non-scientific theories. \n\n\nA good scientific\ntheory, according to Popper, must be a " prohibition." It must give a\ncondition under which the theory must be refuted. \n\n\nHence, Popper rejects verificationism in favour of falsificationism.\n\n\nThus, the above account shows that although Kemery\'s\nmethodological account of science is a neat account and simple to follow, yet\nits credibility is doubtful.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7a1659ca-c709-48c0-9ad3-ccc244413725', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.638177+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9622369408607483, 'non_english_score': 0.03776305913925171}
{'text': 'Q3 \n\n\n Section II \n\n\nBetween late 14th century and mid 18th century, China\'s\npopulation increased five to six fold from 45-60 million to about 400\nmillion. \n\n\nYet, agricultural production increased six\nfold within the period. \n\n\nWhile there were significant\nchanges in the population, the organization of agriculture and the level of\ntechnology remained unchanged. \n\n\nHow was it then, one\nmight ask, that the rural households were able to maintain their living\nstandards up to the mid 18th century despite the rising population pressure\nand the severe competition for limited resources resulting from it.\n\n\nOne of the adjustment the rural households undertook\nwas to increase their agricultural productivity per unit lf land which help\nto increase total production. \n\n\nThere were " rising\nyields within a stagnant technology". \n\n\nAgricultural\nproductivity was increased within the threshold of traditional technology.\n\n\nThere were two types of innovations one can divide\nunder the traditional technology. \n\n\nOne is organic\ninnovation and the other inorganic innovation. \n\n\nThe\nformer involves labour-intensive techniques like double0cropping, improved\nseeds, new crops, irrigation and drainage which help to increase yields per\nacre and also help to absorb the growing population. \n\n\nInorganic innovation involves capital investment in farm implements.\n\n\nNew improved seeds were used by the peasants as a\nmeans to increase their agricultural production. \n\n\nThe\nnew improved seeds were often of a high yielding kind, drought resistant,\nfertilizer responsive and disease resistant. \n\n\nBeing\ndrought resistant, the farmers are ensured that at least there would be some\nyields available during droughts. \n\n\nNew crops like corn\nand sweet potatoes were also introduced to the rural households.\n\n\nCorn can be grown on mountainous regions while sweet\npotatoes are able to grow on dry lands. \n\n\nHence by using\nthese two new crops the farmers were able to extend the arable land for\ncultivation. \n\n\nBesides the two new crops were often of\nhigher yields than the rest of the crops. \n\n\nFor example,\ncorn had 5-15% higher yields than kaoliang and millet.\n\n\nFertilizers either \'natural\' or compound were also\nused to add to the fertility of the soil which helps to increase yields per\nacre. \n\n\nThe collection of fertilizers was also labour\nintensive and hence helped to absorb the rural population.\n\n\nThere was also an increase use of irrigation, drainage\nand water control system in the peasants effort to increase agricultural\nproductivity. \n\n\nIrrigation and drainage to previously\nuncultivable dry lands was able to increase the total acreage of land brought\nunder cultivation. \n\n\nBesides irrigation, drainage and\nwater control also enabled the farmers to switch to cultivation of wet rice\nwhich constitutes the staple food of the population and often yielded higher\nvalues. \n\n\nThe Chinese peasants also migrated to\npreviously uncultivated land in North China, North West China instead of just\nmainly concentrating at the lower Yangtze plain. \n\n\nThis\nmove enabled the increase in the total area of land brought under\ncultivation. \n\n\nHowever by the mid 18th century, the\nrural households could not just rely on increasing agricultural productivity\nto cope with the rising population pressure and severe competition for\nlimited resources. \n\n\nThere was already a maximum labour-land input by the mid 18th century\nwhere the number of cultivable land was running out. \n\n\nThe peasants in their rational economic\nbehaviour in optimizing their chances for survival were increasing resorting\nto sidelines like raising pigs, peddler to supplement their farm income.\n\n\nAn increasing number of peasants also migrated to the\ncities to work as transport coolie or part-time labourers to supplement their\nfarm income. \n\n\nBy the end of 18th century, there was\nalso all increase cases of overseas migration by the peasants to Australia,\nSoutheast Asia and America to work as coolies. \n\n\nIt was\nestimated that by late 18th century, 2m people had migrated overseas to seek\njobs which not only helped to relieve the population pressure at home but\nalso contributed money in the form of remittance sent back home.\n\n\nThe rural households also increasingly turned to their\nlineage and clans who helped in the organization of farm work and gave\nprotection to the rural households from intruders during the difficult time.\n\n\nThe rural households also brought their handicraft\nindustry to the rural areas to supplement their farm income where 25-30% of\nthe farm income was meant for the market. \n\n\nHence by\nincreasing agricultural productivity within the limits of traditional\ntechnology using the labour intensive methods, ruralising the handicraft\nindustry, migration and increasing dependence on the lineage and clans, the\nrural households were able to cope with the rising population pressure and\nsevere competition for limited resources. \n\n\nThis was\nreflected by their living standards which was maintained without a drastic\nfall. \n\n\nHowever the institutional flexibility of the\npeasants had severe implications. \n\n\nAs the technological\nschool of interpretation pointed out while China was able to increase\nagricultural productivity with the limits of traditional technology, she had\nfallen into a vicious trap of overpopulation set by herself.\n\n\nThis trap meant that China had shifted away from\nlabour saving industrializing efforts to labour intensive methods in order to\nabsorb her growing population growth. \n\n\nSuch\ninstitutional flexibility only sought to aggravate the situation as the\neconomic institutions would use labour-intensive methods in order to absorb\nthe population which in turn tend to encourage further population growth as\nsuch techniques require manpower. \n\n\nHence, in the\nshort-run while the institutional flexibility was able to alleviate short-\nterm sufferings of rising population pressure in the long run it would result\nin the prolonging of economic stagnation. \n\n\nBesides, by\nusing the traditional methods of technology, while agricultural production\nwould increase, it would reach a maximum point and then China would lapse\ninto a high-level equilibrium trap beyond which diminishing returns would set\nin. \n\n\nAccording to Mark Elvin the high level equilibrium\nwas already reached by 1800. \n\n\nhence unless there was a\ntechnological breakthrough, diminishing returns would set in.\n\n\nWhile the traditional technology was able to effect\nquantitative changes, there was no qualitative changes in the form of\nincrease per capita income for the rural peasants. \n\n\nAccording to the technological school of thought, the rural households were\nnot unimaginative or conservative as they were receptive to new changes like\nthe new crops of corn and sweet potatoes and had actually invented water-\ndriven machines during Sung China which was found only in 18th century\nEngland but rather because of their technological preference.\n\n\nTheir technological preference for labour intensive\ntechniques was in view of the rising population pressure, they were pragmatic\nin that they were suppose to absorb the growing labour force rather than to\ncreate redundant labour. \n\n\nHence this explained their\nstrong disincentive for labour saving machines. \n\n\nHence\nwhile the rural households were able to cope with rising population pressure\nusing the traditional methods of technology, their institutional flexibility\nhad only prolong the economic stagnation of the country and hamper\nindustrializing efforts. \n\n\nBut on the other hand, it had\nprovided a stable model for China. \n\n \n\n\nQ8  Section III  \n\n\nThe\nChinese proletariat of the Republican period could be viewed as the product\nof modern industrialization efforts in China. \n\n\nThe\nChinese working class while rising rapidly from 1 1/2m in 1919 ro 3m in the\n1920s constituted to less than 1% of Chinese total population.\n\n\nThe working class were often made up of young female\nand male workers who had migrated from the rural areas to the cities to look\nfor jobs. \n\n\nMost of the workers viewed their jobs as\ntransitory and had no identification with their jobs or class as traditional\nties with the family remained significantly strong. \n\n\nThe Chinese workers however were often exploited especially under the\ncontract system. \n\n\nThe Chinese workers had to work very\nlong hours of about 14-16 hours with very low wages, which was only half\ncompared to their Japanese counterparts under very poorly ventilated\nconditions. \n\n\nHealth and medical care was almost nil and\nthe workers were often suffering from tuberculosis or other work hazards.\n\n\nThis to a certain extent led to the development of\nconscious awareness of the exploitation and oppressed giveing rise to a\ndistinctive working class consciousness. \n\n\nHowever most\nof the peasants were illiterate and found it difficult to conceive their\nmisery in terms of class. \n\n\nIn most cases, their hatred\nwas directed towards their most immediate exploitators like the contract\nforeman. \n\n\nBesides as Emily Honig pointed out in her\nstudy of Shanghai Cotton Mills, the female workers often join Sisterhood\nAssociations which was native based rather than Labour Unions.\n\n\nThe female workers had very weak class consciousness\nand had strong ties with their native places. \n\n\nThe\nguilds which dominated the working scene were often occupational based rather\nthan class. \n\n\nAll these prevented greater class\nsolidarity among the worker class. \n\n\nThis was made worse\nperhaps by the increasing number of female workers in the factories which was\ndifficult to be mobilized and often did not interact with others except those\nfrom their native places. \n\n\nThe female workers accounted\nfor 76% of the total workers in the Shanghai Cotton Mill.\n\n\nThe militant labour movement in the 1920s was not an\nisolated movement but had merged with the multi-class nationalistic upsurge\nof anti-warlordism and anti-imperialism which aimed to change the\ninternational and domestic status quo. \n\n\nThe\nrevolutionary nationalism was embodied in the first United Front since 1924.\n\n\nThe rise of the working class could be attributed to\nthe guidance and organization provided by the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP)\nand the protection given by the Kuomingtan ( KMT) \n\n\nSince the main arena of the multi-nationalistic upsurge was located mainly in\nthe industrial cities, the working class due to its concentration in the main\nindustrial centres and their potential for mobilization hence played a\npivotal role. \n\n\nBesides their strategic location in the\nmain theatre of political struggle, the working class was also concentrated\nin 6 enclaves mainly found in big cities like Hong Kong, Canton, Shanghai.\n\n\nTheir geographical location allow easy mobilization to\nserve as a striking political force. \n\n\nThe working class\nwith their economic grievances especially with the re-entry of foreign\ncompetitors and growing inflation could be stated in nationalistic terms and\nevoke widespread sympathy from the various circles in the era where\nnationalistic sentiments were widespread. \n\n\nHence given\nthe favourable external circumstances of anti-imperialism and\nanti-warlordism and the protection and guidance by the KMT and CCP, the\nworking class was able to play a significant role in China\'s politics.\n\n\nThis was despite its weakness as a semi-proletariat\nworking class, weak class consciousness, small in number and young.\n\n\nHowever besides being involved in the nationalistic\nupsurge movement the militant working class was also deeply entangled in the\npolitical struggle within the United Front. \n\n\nThere was\nthis fear by the intellectuals, moderates, capitalists and conservatives\nwithin the UF that the working class which was instigated and dominated by\nthe CCP would escalate from a National labour movement to a social\nRevolution. \n\n\nChiang Kai-Shek shared the aspirations of\nthe fear and was determined to purge the CCP from the UF and suppressed the\nlabour movement which was the base for CCP to capture power from within the\nUF. \n\n\nHence the militant working class was suppressed in\nthe white Terror of 1927 because it was the chief instrument from which the\nCCP sought to capture power. \n\n\nWith the establishment of\nthe Nanking government, Chiang Kai-Shek took strenuous efforts to\ndepoliticize the labour movement. \n\n\nThe labour unions\nwere disbanded or the leaders replaced by government-appointed officials.\n\n\nBy the time, Chiang Kai-Shek tightened his control\nover the country, the labour Unions that existed was what was known as "\nYellow Union" in which the labour unions was not to represent the workers\'\nrights but served to supervise and organize workers in their production.\n\n\nThe 1929 labour union law also prohibited the\nformation of any labour union or other associated activities without\ngovernment\'s approval. \n\n\nHence under the tight control\nof Chiang Kai-Shek the unions that remained were either reorganized KMT\nbodies or bodies that were formed under the shadow of the employers.\n\n\nBesides by the 1930s, the favourable external\nconditions of anti-warlordism and anti-imperialism movement that had pushed\nthe working class into the forefront of history as a significant political\nforce had subsided with Chiang Kai-Shek unifying the whole of China under his\nauthoritative rule.  \n\n\nBesides Chiang also looked\ninto the material well-being of the working class and sought to improve it\nbit by bit like better wages and working hours and hence depriving and\neliminating the economic grievances of the working class.\n\n\nBy 1930s, the communists were completely pushed out\nof the cities and hence the working class were deprived of an external\nsupporter to guide and organize. \n\n\nThe working class\nwas able to become a significant political force in the 1920s was mainly due\nto the favourable external forces The working class remained young, too\ndifferentiated from their agrarian heritage to be able to play an articulate,\nself-conscious class alone without the support of the outside forces.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'cc4d50a6-ff02-4c9e-a40b-a8fec5e06f4e', 'added':

{'text': 'Q1 \n\n\nClausewitz is considered\nby many as one of the foremost European military strategist.\n\n\nHis contributions to warfare, though criticized by some\nwriters, in my opinion has given a profound impact to modern strategic\nthinking. \n\n\nThis essay will closely examine the major\ncontributions made by Clausewitz in the study of warfare and at the same time\nshowing why his reputation is based on firm foundation. \n\n\nClausewitz considered war more of an art than science. \n\n\nIt was creative and not imitative. \n\n\nHence, warfare which\nwas constantly undergoing changes had to accommodate to the changing\nsituations and adapt according to the circumstances. \n\n\nFlexibility in warfare was advocated, and relevantly so by Clausewitz.\n\n\nClausewitz said that war should serve the political\npurpose for which it is being waged. \n\n\nhence drew a\nsymbiotic relationship between strategy and statecraft.\n\n\nThe political purpose for which the war is the means,\nand there cannot be an end by itself. \n\n\nHence, war\nshould serve the political purpose for which it is being waged.\n\n\nClausewitz put this very clearly when he said " War\nhas got its own language ( grammar) but not its own logic." I tend to agree\nwith Clausewitz view as it is true that wars ( generally) are being waged\nwith a political purpose. \n\n\nAlthough in the third world\ncountries we see the military ( war) at times replacing the political\npurpose, it cannot be said that Clausewitz theory falls short of what he\nclaims. \n\n\nLooking at the recent Gulf crisis gives a very\ngood example of the military serving the government ( political purpose.) The\npolitical purpose was to see the Iraqi troops being forced out of Kuwait, and\nonce that purpose was met a ceasefire was called and negotiations for a\npeaceful settlement has started. \n\n\nCluasewitz clearly\ndefines the role of the political leaders. \n\n\nHere\nClausewitz draws the hallmark of his thought - the trinity of the government,\nthe military and the people. \n\n\nWhile the government\nprovides the political purpose, the military provides the means for achieving\nthe political purpose and the people the will - the enigma of determination.\n\n\nThis for Clausewitz is his indispensable foundation of\nhis theory. \n\n\nClausewitz clearly spells out the role of\nthe political leaders. \n\n\nThey are supposed to provide\nthe leadership and draw the political purpose for which a war is to be waged.\n\n\nThe military on its part, since the political leaders\nprovide the purpose, has to subordinate itself to the political will.\n\n\nHence, the military carrys out the purpose of the\npolitical leaders. \n\n\nFor Clausewitz, war is a \'bloody\nviolence,\' to its outmost. \n\n\nIt is an act of violence\naimed at compelling our opponents to do our will. \n\n\nBecause Clausewitz claimed that war should be waged to its outmost ( absolute\nwar) he came under severe criticism, especially from J.FC Fuller for the\nviolence in the 2nd world war. \n\n\nHowever, one has to\nunderstand what Clausewitz really meant. \n\n\nWhat\nClausewitz meant was war in the \'abstract.\' In reality, there were several\nfrictions in war ( fogs of war) such as terrain, weather morale and so forth\nthat constraint war being waged to its maximum. \n\n\nIf we\nlooked at the recent Gulf crisis, we can see Clausewitz\'s relevance where the\nwar being waged at it outmost with the allied bombing was constantly hindered\nby \'frictions\' especially the weather, hence resulting in the allied forces\ncutting down their sorties. \n\n\nFor Clausewitz there are\nnot given \'set of rules\' in war that qualifies as a strategy.\n\n\nThis is because firstly Clausewitz feels that war is\nimperative. \n\n\nNobody would exactly know what the enemy\nreally is up to. \n\n\nAlso given the problems in gathering\ncorrect information hinders forces from planning out a exact strategy.\n\n\nClausewitz instead advocates that one should rather\nlocate the enemy\'s \'centre of gravity\' and concentrate in attacking the\ncentre of gravity which is the pivotal of the enemy\'s strength.\n\n\nIt could be its airbases, communication lines or given\nits food granary. \n\n\nIt is true that each country has its\ncentre of gravity and a destruction of the centre of gravity could bring a\nquick end to the war. \n\n\nFor example, India\'s centre of\ngravity is its navy and the destruction of its navy would make its security\nredundant. \n\n\nClausewitz advocates the defense strategy\nto that of the offense. \n\n\nThis is because he feels that\nit is easier to hold \'ground than to take new one.\' However one should not\nbrush this as just a \'passive act.\' Clausewitz defense is broken down into 2\nstages. \n\n\nFirstly, one waits for the attack, being well\nprepared and then deal it with a swift counter offensive.\n\n\nHaving achieved this, it would a set the satge for the\nforces to then proceed to the offense which would allow the forces to be in a\nbetter position. \n\n\nHowever, given the rapid advancement\nin modern technology today, the would be some doubt our Clausewitz advocation\nof the theory, as one country as got a effective defense system against\nnuclear technology. \n\n\nBut if we adhere to Clausewitz\nbeleif that it si easier to \'hold ground\' than acquire new one it does proven\nrelevant as one is more familiar with the terrain, condition and so on.\n\n\nClausewitz feels that numerical superiority in war\nplays a important factor. \n\n\nOne should first be\nnumerically superior generally and then at decisive points.\n\n\nFor Clausewitz suprise is more of a tactic than a\nstrategy. \n\n\nClausewitz pays close attention to the human\nfactor - moral and will. \n\n\nTo him it is a inseparable\nmarriage with war. \n\n\nGenerally, all strategist have\ngiven priority to the human factor where moral factors and human will plays a\ncrucial role in the outcome of battles. \n\n\nIn a final\nanalysis, I do not think that Clausewitz role has been blown out of\nproportion. \n\n\nWhat Clausewitz advocated in the\nrelationship between war and politics is generally what all states at present\nadhere to. \n\n\nFor example, in the Korean war had\nMacArthur ( the military) defied Truman ( the political purpose) which he\nbadly wanted to and staged a attack beyond the political purpose of \'containment\'\none may be be able to imagine the devastating consequences, as it could have\ntriggered off a third world war, with the Soviet Union and CHina intervening.\n\n\nHence, the central tenet of Clausewitz theory of the\nmilitary being subordinate to the government can in a way be considered as a \'safeguard.\'\n\n\nClausewitz role in my opinion has not been blown out\nof proportion. \n\n\nA clear understanding of his war in the \'abstract\'\nand war in reality, as explained in the essay, is needed. \n\n \n\n\nQ2 \n\n\nB H Liddell Hart has\nindeed correctly put the Sun Tzu has clearer vision, more profound insight\nand eternal freshness. \n\n\nNo other testimony is a better\nsupport to this statement than to say that what Sun Tzu had advocated\ncenturies ago, is till this present day still relevant and was closely\nadhered by a present contemporary - Mao Tse Tung who following Sun Tzu\'s\nmaxims established a new regime in China in 1949. \n\n\nAs\nthe quotation suggest Sun Tzu\'s \'Art of War\' is indeed comprehensive,\ncovering generally all aspects in staging a warfare and also is very simple\nto understand. \n\n\nIt is indeed as Liddell Hart comments,\nthe \'essence on the conduct of war.\' Sun Tzu is considered as the \'saint\' in\nancient Chinese strategic thinking because of the \'profound insight\' he was\nable to show in the conduct of warfare, not only in ancient time but\ncorrectly anticipating the changing evolution of warfare in time to come.\n\n\nIt is important to note that Sun Tzu never thought of\nhow to avoid war but rather how to conduct war. \n\n\nWar to\nSun Tzu is a recurring act which cannot be avoided, hence it was only useful\nthat one should study the conduct of warfare. \n\n\nTo Sun\nTzu the study of war was associated with victory and victory can be achieved\nby using the correct strategy. \n\n\nSun Tzu was against\nviolence or brute force and to him it should only be used as a last resort.\n\n\nHere, one must note that Sun Tzu was not advocating \'zero\'\nviolence rather he talked of how violence could be kept to the minimum.\n\n\nSun Tzu\'s belief in minimum violence dates back to the\nConfucian maxim which advocated the triumph of the wen ( literate culture)\nover the wu ( warfare). \n\n\nA righteous leader should\nnever resort to violence to achieve his aims. \n\n\nFurthermore Sun Tzu believed in a \'harmonious\' society which would not be\ncondoned by violence. \n\n\nAt the strategic level Sun Tzu\nalso saw that if a city can be taken intact, its resources can be put to good\nuse by the victor. \n\n\nNo one can deny what Sun Tzu\nadvocated was relevant. \n\n\nIn our present society, no one\nlikes to see violence or cities being destroyed, and like Sun Tzu said\nviolence should be used as a last resort. \n\n\nIt is indeed\ntrue that even people in our present day believe living in a \'harmonious\'\nsoceity. \n\n\nSun Tzu advocated 4 levels of strategy in\nachieving victory. \n\n\nThe best level was to attack the\nenemy\'s plan and put him off balance. \n\n\nIn Confusion and\nfear he will be forced to flee. \n\n\nThis was what Liddell\nHart was later to term as \'psychological dislocation.\' The second best level\nis to break the enemy\'s alliance. \n\n\nThis was then make\nthe enemy weak and easily susceptible, I tend to agree with the relevance of\nthis strategy by Sun Tzu. \n\n\nIn the latest warfare - the\nGulf crisis, Saddam Hussein knowing very well how formidable the alliance\nwas, attempted to break up the alliance by trying to drag Israel into the\nwar. \n\n\nIf this had happened quite surely the alliance\nmight have been broken. \n\n\nSun Tzu\'s third level of\nstrategy called for a direct attack on the enemy\'s forces which was to be\ntaken only if there was no other choice. \n\n\nThe worst\nlevel of strategy was to attack cities. \n\n\nGenerally, we\nnotice that all contemporary warfare are waged on this \'levels of strategy.\'\nstates do try to negotiate to keep violence to the minimum.\n\n\nEven when war does break up a direct confrontation ro\nattack on cities, is used as a last resort. \n\n\nTo achieve\nthe success of the strategy Sun Tzu gives a clear understanding on the\nconcept of deception. \n\n\nTo him all warfare is based on\ndeception.\' Rightly so in warfare the \'art of deception\' does stand out as\nthe \'lethal weapon.\' In deception, Sun tells how one is to pretend and\nconceal one own\'s strength and deceive the enemy into falling for your\ndeception. \n\n\nHe also cautions not in the event, be\ndeceived by the enemy. \n\n\nDeception to him is the key to\nachieving victory. \n\n\nTo achieve deception Sun Tzu talks\nof \'foreknowledge\' and the employment of secret agents who will carry out\nthis job of gathering information. \n\n\nThis indeed is true\neven till this day. \n\n\nFor example in the Arab Israel;\nwar of 1967, the Israeli secret agent successfully got hold of the Arab War\nPlans, thus were able to destroy the Arab Forces. \n\n\nEven\nin the second world war the allied forces deceived the Germans into believing\nthe amphibious attack would take place at Pas-De-Calais but instead\nsuccessfully landed at Normandy. \n\n\nSun Tzu believe that\nwhoever has the initiative in the battleground would be able to put the enemy \'like\na puppet in a string\' does instead prove relevant. \n\n\nThe\nGulf crisis showed that right from the beginning, the allied forces were able\nto take the initiative and dictate the pace in the war.\n\n\nAs correctly said by Sun Tzu, the Allied forces were\nable to delve when and where the ground offensive was to take place, since\nthey had the initiative in the war. \n\n\nSun Tzu also\nstressed deeply on the Human factor in war. \n\n\nThis\naspect by Sun Tzu was something that run through the writings of all\nfollowing strategic writers such as Clausewitz, Machiavelli, Moltke and\nLiddell Hart. \n\n\nThe relevance of the human factor in its\ncrucial role in war, cannot be denied. \n\n\nSun Tzu had\nindeed shown profound insight when he stressed the important relationship\nbetween the government and the people, and the commanders and the soldiers.\n \n\n\nLike Clausewitz he felt that the military should\nsubordinate itself to the government in power, which in turn had to fulfill\nits duty of governing righteously. \n\n\nIn a final\nanalysis, I strongly believe that what Liddell Hart commented about Sun Tzu\nis indeed true. \n\n\nSun Tzu\'s Art of War showing simple\nprinciples of war has indeed proved its relevance. \n\n\nMao Tse Tung has proved that to be a living testimony for the proving the \'concentrated\nessence\' of Sun Tzu\'s Art of War. \n\n\nBy adopting to Sun\nTzu\'s principles he sucessfully gained power in China.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '37f6e4a0-6ba1-49b9-b399-1ab36f02ca5a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.640926+00:00', 'english_score': 0.969772458076477, 'non_english_score': 0.03022754192352295}
{'text': 'Q1 \n\n\nIndeed, to explain for the\nslow progress in late-Ching\'s industrialization, two approaches were being\nput forward, namely the domestic-limitation approach and the\nforeign-intervention approach. \n\n\nThe domestic elements in\nparticular the traditional institution and ideologies had inhibited the\nprogress of modern enterprises but it was the foreign intrusion that was the\ngreatest evil of the two. \n\n\nThe failure in China\'s\nindustrial development can be directly attributed to the negative effects of\nforeign intrusion and dominance in the Chinese economic sphere.\n\n\nAccording to the domestic-limitation approach,\nConfucianism and its traditional institution had prohibited China\'s path to\nindustrialisation and that China\'s institutions must be replaced by western\nones before it can industrialise. \n\n\nThe theorists had\nargued that every movement of westernization had been obstructed at every\nturn by the ignorant and prejudiced Confucian literati. \n\n\nThe Confucian spirit against scientific research was strong, and they also\ndiscourage general economic growth through a capitalist economy and the\nsuppression of merchants class. \n\n\nmerchants were not\nallow to challenge government monopolies as well as the prerogatives of the\ngovernment officials. \n\n\nThere was an element of truth in\nthe domestic limitation approach in the account of inhibiting late Ching\'s\nindustrialization, I would not fault the Confucian culture.\n\n\nIn fact, the Ching government had began to encourage\nprivate enterprises and in 1908, it had also established the new western\nstyle commercial code to give protection to Chinese joint stock company.\n\n\nMore importantly, in 1905, the civil service\nexaminations were abolished. \n\n\nYet, China had still\nfailed in its industrialization despite the great effort that government had\nput in. \n\n\nAs to the point that the elite was ignorant or\nprejudice against modern technology, this argument could not hold because the\nattitude of this class had changed by the turn of 19th century.\n\n\nThis was evident in foremost leaders like Li Hung\nchange, Chang Chih Tung and Chang Chien who was aware of the need for China\nto industrialise and modernise. \n\n\nThis was illustrated\nin official sponsored modern enterprises such as kuan tu shan pan and kuan tu\nho pan which clearly showed that the elite like the other government\nofficials and gentry had realized the feasibilities of merchant cooperation.\n\n\nThis was further illustrated in Chang Chien\'s act, who\nresigned from government as a scholar-official. \n\n\nIn his\nattempt to look for financial and managerial backing, he did not turn to\nmerchants unlike others such as Chou Hsueh Hsu. \n\n\nhence,\nfrom Li Hung Chang, Chang Chien and Chang Chih Tung, it showed that the elite\nclass do have a positive attitude towards industrialization.\n\n\nThus, the domestic-limitation approach\'s argument\nthat the elite class as a obstacle to industrialization could not really hold\nin that sense. \n\n\nIn addition, internal succession\nproblem and court disputes were responsible for inhibiting China\'s\nindustrialization. \n\n\nWith constant court intrigues and\nsuccession problems, the Chinese Empire fell into the hands of empress Tsu\nXi. \n\n\nThe empress using all her energy, intelligence and\ncunning scheme had tried to keep all power in her hands.\n\n\nHence, China in the first half of 20th century was\nruled by central authority who was not able to understand the necessity or\nthe urgency for China to industrialise. \n\n\nWorst still,\nit was not only passive, but was always in opposition to innovation\n\n\nThus, from the above, one can see that the domestic\nenvironment had indeed served as a hindrance to late Ching\'s\nindustrialization progress. \n\n\nHowever, besides this\napproach, one also had to take into consideration of the foreign intervention\napproach which I think have generated greater negative effects\n\n\nAnd constrains in China\'s slowness in\nindustrialization. \n\n\nThe modernisation approach had\nargued that foreign trade and investments were beneficial to China\'s\ndevelopment. \n\n\nThe theorist of this approach such as Chu\nMing Hsi had argued that the foreign trade and investments were innovative\nforces that provided China with whatever modernisation or preconditions she\nhad before 1937. \n\n\nBut, other authors like Murphy,\nStephen Thomas and Gemet had different views. \n\n\nMurphy\nhad put forward the argument that the Chinese treaty ports had failed to\nbuilt up a respectable volume of new trade. \n\n\nThe treaty\nports had failed to induce a lasting or self perpetuating variety of\nmodernisation. \n\n\nit was true that foreign innovations in\nthe treaty ports, foreign technology and institutional effectiveness had left\nan impact on the Chinese intellectuals, but this impact was neither deep nor\nwidespread. \n\n\nMoreover, the treaty ports main concern\nwas only with a few commodities with opium and cotton among the imports and\ntea and silk among the exports. \n\n\nThe overall\ncontribution of the treaty port was too marginal to have been seen as aspect\nof modernisation. \n\n\nIn view of this, Murphy had likened\nthe treaty ports as " a fly on an elephant" with very modest growth and its\neffects on other sectors were very low. \n\n\nBoth Stephen\nThomas and Gemet subscribed to the imperialist approach.\n\n\nThey had the same opinion that it was foreign\nintrusion and dominance that prohibited the growth of native industries and\nenterprises. \n\n\nTogether with this was the unequal\ntreaties and indemnities imposed upon China that further weakened her ability\nin industrialisation. \n\n\nStephen Thomas had argued that\nthe failure or slowness of China\'s attempts in industrialization was due to\nthe constraints imposed upon it by foreign intrusions and unfair trade\nsystem. \n\n\nForeign interventionists, in particular, the\nBritish had used its military superiority might to intervene in free market\nmechanisms, created artificial advantages for foreign enterprises, and also\nprevent the government from assuming even a minimum responsibilities which\nwere necessary to support successful economic growth and industrialisation.\n\n\nThe foreigners also prevented China from enjoying the\nbenefits of its export of tea and silk by preventing the Chinese government\nfrom banning the hugh import of opium. \n\n\nStephen Thomas\nhad felt that if there was no opium import, China would have a considerable\namount of foreign exchange surpluses and could use these surpluses to import\nforeign technology as Japan did. \n\n\nUnfortunately, by\nforcing China to import opium, the British was able to neutralise China\'s\ntrade and kept it almost constantly in the negative balance of trade.\n\n\nBesides the opium trade which was imposed on China\nthrough military coercion, there was also the unequal treaties that deprived\nChina of her tariff control which was fixed at only 5%.\n\n\nThus, foreign intrusion had led to limitation of\nsovereignty and this limited sovereignty had resulted in diminishing control\nof crucial areas of economic planning and support. \n\n\nThis will in turn prevent the implementation of important economic policies\nnecessary for China\'s industrialisation process. \n\n\nGemet\nhad argued that constant acts of aggression by the foreigners in China had\ncaused China to concentrate its industrialization on military aspects and\nthus deprived China from providing herself with infrastructures that was\nessential for industrial growth. \n\n\nGemet had argued that\nforeign modest of life, behaviour, their pretensions and wealth and the\nhumiliation they had inflicted upon China had created in the Chinese a sense\nof inferiority complex. \n\n\nThis was to harm gravely the\nprocess of adaptation to the great changes occurring in contemporary period.\n\n\nIn the matter of modernisation, Gemet augured that\nChina had rejected it through a xenophobic reflex what she would have\naccepted had she been more independent. \n\n\nIn addition to\nthe above, the series of defeats experience by China was worth mentioning.\n\n\nAfter the defeat of the opium war 1840, a string of\ndefeats followed such as the Franco-Chinese incident of 1884 and\nSino-Japanese war of 1894 with the harsh conditions imposed by the foreigners\nafter their victories had greatly weakened China\'s independence and her\nability to resist. \n\n\nAfter the signing of Shimonoseki\nTreaty and the extraction of hugh indemnities from China after the Boxer\nRebellion, the foreign pressure not only act as incitement in China but also\neconomically, politically, socially and even a psychological one which had\ncause the birth and development of hostility among Chinese which was often\nextended to the innovations the foreigners introduced. \n\n\nCompared to Japan, who had succeeded in industrialisation because of an\nefficient control government and resources, China had none.\n\n\nThe Japanese government was able to extract revenues\nfrom peasants through the taxes levied on them. \n\n\nChina\'s because it had always preferred a low-cost government was thus unable\nto extract much revenues from the provinces and hence suffered the lack of\ncapital that was essential for industrialisation purposes.\n\n\nIn conclusion, though the country\'s domestic\nenvironment had played a part in prohibiting late Ching\'s industrialisation,\nthe foreign intrusion had a part to play too. \n\n\nit was,\nin my opinion, that foreign intrusion and dominance more responsible for the\nslow progress in China industrialisation. \n\n\nThis was\nbecause with the defeats in war, the foreigners demanded unequal treaties and\nhuge indemnities which China as a defeater could not bargain but to submit\nquietly, such treaties had given foreigners more privileges in China and was\nhence able to control China\'s economic sphere and manipulate it to their\nadvantage. \n\n \n\n\nQ3 \n\n\nPrior to the 20th\ncentury, the Chinese economy was largely agrarian. \n\n\nAgriculture was the main occupation of a large part of the population.\n\n\nBetween mid 18th century and mid 19th century, China\'s\npopulation had surpassed the 400 million mark and thus created population\npressures. \n\n\nHowever, the traditional agriculture was\nable to expand and adjust itself to meet the overpopulation challenge and\nprevented massive unemployment, and at the same time maintaining the living\nstandards of the populace. \n\n\nChina\'s cultivated land was\nsmall in comparison to the population. \n\n\nHence, it\ncreated a very competitive environment which influenced and was reflect in\nvarious Chinese way of life. \n\n\nSocially, it had led to\nthe establishment of class and lineage groupings. \n\n\nEconomically, it had its impacts on farming institutions and the choice of\nfarming technology. \n\n\nOverpopulation had laid its impact\non technological preference of the producers which was to delay China in the\nadoption of modern technology. \n\n\nBy technological\npreference, Chao Kang meant that traditional labour-intensive method was\npreferred, rather than labour-saving methods. \n\n\nThis\nbackward trend in technological preference was manifested in various ways.\n\n\nThe fact that Chinese after 12th century had stopped\ninventing new labour-saving implements and the abandonment of those that were\ninvented before 12th century was one such example. \n\n\nAfter, the ability of Chinese to invent new labour-saving implements before\n12th century had proved that the Chinese was not conservative to change\nneither were they backward to invent. \n\n\nRather, the\nchange was due to a change in technological preference as labour-intensive\ntechnology will help to absorb the large population and prevent large-scale\nunemployment. \n\n\nAlthough traditional technology was\npreferred, it does not mean that traditional technology was static.\n\n\nThe combination of a rising population with an\ninstitution framework that did not discourage improvements had resulted in an\nincrease in grain output. \n\n\nThis meant that there was an\ndefinite quantitative increase in total grain production.\n\n\nThis was made possible because of the opening up of\nlands previously deem suitable for uncultivation. \n\n\nSince the beginning of Sung, many Chinese had migrated to Kwantung, Kweichou,\nYunnan and Szechuan. \n\n\nThis was continued into the Ming-\nChing period. \n\n\nThe Chinese also moved to Manchuria\nhomeland in the north east and north west. \n\n\nThey opened\nhilly and low-lying lands and terraced the fields in the mountains.\n\n\nThis was made possible by the technological\nadvancement. \n\n\nThis was especially true in terracing the\nfields because only with new technological advance could water be carried up\nto the mountain slopes. \n\n\nBy the 20th century, the\ncultivated lands were four times of that in the 14-century.\n\n\nThis had led to the in increase in half of acreage\noutput and other half was from grain yields per unit. \n\n\nThe Rural households was able to cope with rising population pressure was due\nto several factors. \n\n\nThis factors also helped to\nexplain why the traditional technology was able to expand and adjust itself\nto meet the population pressure while at the same time maintain the living\nstandard of the populace. \n\n\nOne of the factor was the\nexpansion of double-cropped areas or the transformation of the\ndouble-cropping system. \n\n\nPopulation growth and water\ncontrol ? \n\n\nplayed a great role in this expansion and\nchange. \n\n\nThe double-cropping of rice and wheat, wheat\nand barley or even two rice crops in a year was practised. \n\n\nThus, in these activities, large amount of labour was\nrequired. \n\n\nEspecially in rice cultivation, water\nsupply was of major importance. \n\n\nThus, the operation\nof this system was able to absorb the large population especially during the\ntime when the first crop was harvested and land prepared and the planting of\nsecond crop. \n\n\nAll these had to be done in a very short\nperiod, hence heavy labour consumption was a requirement.\n\n\nThus, the expansion and change of this system had\nmade overpopulation unobservable rather it had instead created a misleading\nsense of labour shortages among the cultivation. \n\n\nThus, the traditional technology was able to absorb the overpopulation\npressure through its labour intensive technology, which in turn had also lead\nto further population growth. \n\n\nIn other words, the\nlabour-intensive technology was paradoxically the solution to overpopulation\nwhile it also the cause of further population growth.\n\n\nAnother factor was the importation of new improved\nseeds and new crops from America. \n\n\nThis had the\neffect of increasing yields, reduction in crop failures and enhanced double\ncropping. \n\n\nNew crops such as corns and potatoes were\ntwo major ones. \n\n\nWith new improved seeds and new\ncorps, it was able to lead to expansion of the cultivated land, increased the\nyields and hence able to support the population. \n\n\nContribution also cane from the capital imputs of water works construction.\n\n\nSuch construction had made possible the cultivation\nof rice in land where otherwise dry-land crops had to be cultivated.\n\n\nBesides, enhancing the process of doublecropping,\nwater works had also made way rice cultivation possible and it had left a\ngreat impact on the productivity of land in any given area.\n\n\nMoreover, the construction of water works was able\nto absorb a great deal of labour hence absorbing the overpopulation pressure,\nwhile enhancing the output of grain. \n\n\nIncreased in\nfertilizer was important too. \n\n\nThe most common form\nof fertilizer was nightsoil and with the increased in the population, more\nfertilizer was made available for agriculture. \n\n\nThus,\nfrom the above, one can see that the traditional agriculture sector was able\nto expand and adjust itself to meet the challenge of the overpopulation\npressure. \n\n\nBy the 19th and 20th century, the changes\nin the cropping system and the increased in traditional capital imputs per\nunit had succeeded in increasing the national grain yields per month with all\nthe grains taken together. \n\n\nThis was closely tied up\nwith population growth and the further expansion of labour.\n\n\nThus, a vicious cycle was created, whereby the\nchanges were meant to absorb the overpopulation pressure had simultaneously\nled to further expansion of the population. \n\n\nHowever,\nthe preference for traditional techniques or technology had resulted in the\ndelayed of adoption of modern technology in imperial China.\n\n\nLabour-intensive method was preferred because it was\nthe only way that the rural households can cope with rising population\npressure. \n\n\nHence, labour-saving method was not much\nuseful. \n\n\nRather if adopted would lead to an abundant\nof labour and unemployment of large-scale with the consequence of social and\npolitical instability. \n\n\nThus, the labour-intensive\nmethod was adopted because of practical reasons with regard to socio-economic\nenvironment. \n\n\nIn conclusion, China had reached a\npopulation trap with institutional flexibility had worsened the situation.\n\n\nThe institutional flexibility was able to absorb the\noverpopulation pressure by it had also caused further population growth.\n\n\nIf this was to continue on, China will reach the\nhigh level equilibrium trap whereby more outputs can only be attained with\nthe aid of modern technology.',

{'text': 'Q5 \n\n\nThe structural approach to\nlanguage development empahsises on the analysis of the produced forms or\nlinguistic items as opposed to the functional/interactional approach which\nsees language as a means of communication, the interact, that is, a more\nsocial perspective as opposed to the former which more linguistic in\nperspective. \n\n\nOne of the structural approaches to\nlanguage development is the Behaviourist Model which believes that language\nis a result of habit-forming. \n\n\nThe most famous model was\nthat proposed by Skinner with Stimulus-Response Hypothesis which he likened\nlanguage acquisition to that of reacting to the environment.\n\n\nThe stimulus, like the classic example of Pavlov\'s\ndog-experiment, who salivated at the sound of a bell. \n\n\nSkinner thought that this was the best example of what conditioning does to\nlanguage. \n\n\nIn terms of the child, his arms are\noutstretched when the mother or caregiver carries. \n\n\nTherefore, this is a form of stimulus where he will stretch his arms whenever\nhe wants to be carried, therefore language operates it in the same way.\n\n\nHowever, the biggest weakness of this approach is that\nit does not take into consideration utterances that are not a direct or\nindirect result of stimulus. \n\n\nFor Skinner, only the\npresence of a stimulus will bring about a response. \n\n\nAlthough children talk to gain attention or convey their needs, they also\nengage in egocentric talk where it has no apparent purpose or is a direct\nresult of any stimulus from his environment. \n\n\nFor\nChomsky, although his Innateness Hypothesis can to a great extent explain the\nrule-forming and rule-testing, his denial of the influence or necessity of\ncaregivers for language development does not help to account for children who\ndo not learn to speak when they were cut off from human contact.\n\n\nExamples of wolf-boys or children shut up in attics\nthat do not learn language seem to indicate that interaction is important for\nthe child to acquire language. \n\n\nChomsky sees linguistic\ninput as degenerated and they enter a " black box" known as : Language\nAcquisition Device" ( LAD where the child is able to internalise those forms\nand produces them in his linguistic output. \n\n\nThe child\nforms his theory or rules about the language in the LAD and tests them.\n\n\nThis is true about children who are impervious to\ncorrection and do not imitate forms as the behaviourists suggest but rather\nform their own theories and rules about the language and stick on to them\nuntil they have found others to replace them. \n\n\nThe\nbehaviourists believe that children learn through imitation and therefore\ndismiss the replacement rule. \n\n\nThis is erroneous as can\nbe seen from children\'s acquisition of limited forms of the past tense but\ndiscarding them when he overgeneralises or overapplies the rule and refuses\nto be corrected regardless of correction, explicit or implicit.\n\n\nFunctionalists and interactionsists on the other hand\nview interaction and socialisation as a more important aspect of language.\n\n\nFor Wells, he sees language acquisition as a\ncollaborative affair which requires the co-operation between the child and\nthe care giver. \n\n\nThe child is able to learn language\nonly through interaction with others, it is able then to test his hypothesis\nor rules about the language with his caregiver. \n\n\nFor MC\nTear, he used the " conversation structure" to account for the rule\nconfirmation or whether the utterance is acceptable to the hearer.\n\n\nIn fact, for interactionsts, it seems to be that\nexperience is an important factor in shaping language for the child acquires\nlanguage as a direct result of interacting with adults.\n\n\nThis seems to be plausible as exemplified by the\ntendency of children to talk incessantly once they have acquired speech and\nindicate their solidarity and camaraderie with people whom they are most\nwilling to talk to or talk the most to. \n\n\nSpeech acts is\na more important consideration to interactionists where the child learns\nacceptable rules of the appropriate time and place to say certain things\nrather than producing the correct forms. \n\n\nThis is\nindicated by a response to the former expression or initiation of a new topic\nof the other party. \n\n \n\n\nQ8 \n\n\nKrashen\'s Comprehensible\nInput Hypothesis assumes that all data has to be comprehensible to the child\nbefore he is able to Acura it. \n\n\nOtherwise, the child\nwould be unable to internalise it and will not become part of his system.\n\n\nIn fact, Krashen is against the pure linguistic\nclasses as he sees it as utterly useless to the child\'s understanding and\nacquisition of language. \n\n\nKrashen prefers a lesson\nwhose content and main objective is not aimed at target linguistic items but\nrather that of a science or geography class which does not highlight a\nparticular characteristic of the language. \n\n\nThis is\nbecause Krashen believes that in order for a child to pick up a certain item,\nthe teacher must provide a wider " net" that consists of rough-tuned items\nsuch that the child will be able to pick up the intended.\n\n\nKrashen used I+i to stand for " coveted" item and\nI+ii, I+iii and etc to stand for other available items which are not the "\ntargeted" item or what Singaporeans would in Singapore\'s terms call " beyond\nthe syllabus" or " not in the syllabus". \n\n\nBy spreading\nsuch a net, the child is then able to pick up the item concerned.\n\n\nThis can be seen as a form of challenge to the child\nwho is exposed to more difficult forms than he has thought to be capable of\nproducing. \n\n\nIn certain cases, the child might even be\nable to pick up the forms that were not meant for him. \n\n\nThe Comprehensible Input Hypothesis seems to promote a more functional\napproach to language in that language is use in the transmission of\ninformation other than linguistic knowledge. \n\n\nIt seems\nto endorse Macnamara\'s suggestion for a more authentic classroom situation\nwhere children learn language while engaged in play such as baking or cooking\nlessons. \n\n\nIf a child is able to learn more effectively\nwhen engaged in interaction and in a stress-free environment, then the\ncomprehensible input Hypothesis does seem to be more helpful in the planning\nof the syllabus for children in Singapore schools. \n\n\nIn\nSingapore schools, the main objective of education seems to be in preparing\nthe children for examinations. \n\n\nTherefore, the teacher\nhas to cover the whole syllabus regardless whether the students are able to\nunderstand or absorb the data. \n\n\nThis is in opposition\nto Krashen\'s hypothesis in that the language has to be comprehensible before\nthe child is able to acquire or learn it. \n\n\nThe system\nin Singapore does not take into consideration the differences in the\nabilities of the children as the data may be comprehensible to some but not\nothers. \n\n\nSuch a situation is worst for children in\nlower primary who are not yet streamed according to their abilities.\n\n\nThe difference in understanding between the best pupil\nand the poorest is so great that the teacher cannot do enough to challenge\nthe bright and yet take care of the weak. \n\n\nTherefore,\nthe " net" that the teacher has to spread is constrained by such conditions.\n\n\nThe size of the classes also prevents the teachers\nfrom catering to the individual need of the children. \n\n\nIn any form of play, the children have to take turns and the lesson or time\nallotted is too short for them to actually engage in what is other than the\nhighlighting of characteristic features of the language and learning by rote\nand drilling which is the most orderly and viable means to the teacher.\n\n\nUnless the classes can be reduced to half or a third\nof its present size, very little can be adapted from our understanding of\nKrashen\'s hypothesis to help or improve the language development in Singapore\nschools. \n\n\nHowever, Krashen\'s hypothesis also presents\ncertain problems in that we do not know how the teacher is supposed to grade\nI+i, I+ii in terms of its difficulty. \n\n\nDifficulty is\nsubjective to different learners. \n\n\nIn Singapore, as the\nmain objective of education seems to be passing examinations, topics or items\nthat are not acquired by the child will result in his failure in the\nexaminations. \n\n\nTherefore, Krashen\'s hypothesis does not\nappear to be too valid in Singapore\'s context. \n\n\nUnless\nSingapore is able to move away from its stress on examination to the quality\nof learning or language development in this case, Krashen\'s Hypothesis can\nonly be applied with very limited results as can be seen from the lower\nprimary education which have activities-based lessons like REAP but the\nmainstream education would still be highly dependent upon drills and learning\nby rote. \n\n \n\n\nQ4 \n\n\nThe difficulty in\nlearning the second school language could be the effect of lack of authentic\nsituations or the need in using the language. \n\n\nIn the\ncase of Macnamara\'s study, where children were able to communicate\neffectively or acquire the language more efficiently from peers and friends\nbecause of the need to identify with them. \n\n\nIn the case\nof difficulty in the second school language, the child may not be able to see\nthe actual use or necessity of learning it. \n\n\nAnother\ndifficulty may be presented in the lack of understanding the distance between\nthe two languages as proposed by the Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis ( CA).\n\n\nCertain linguistic rules may be more difficult to\nacquire because they are not present in the first language.\n\n\nThe case given was the use of relative clauses in\nArabic and Chinese. \n\n\nHowever, for children whose home\nor first language is English, the difficulty may arise in the use of\nquantifiers where different quantifiers are used for countable nouns and\nuncountable nouns in Chinese. \n\n\nEnglish only has a class\nof quantifiers for countable and another for uncountable nouns.\n\n\nChinese has different quantifiers within countable\nnouns and uncountable nouns. \n\n\nTherefore, one such\ndifficulty may be present. \n\n\nAccording to the CA, by\nknowing the difficulties, the teacher may then emphasize or have more time\nallotted for the teaching for these items. \n\n\nHowever,\nthere has been no mention of such a consideration in the compilation of\nsyllabuses for the second languages. \n\n\nThe child\'s\nattitude towards the language may be another barrier to the child\'s learning\nas according to Krashen\'s Affective Filter Hypothesis, it may form as a block\nto the child\'s learning. \n\n\nThe child may also lack a\nhypothesis testing ground as his family members may only communicate in\nEnglish and not the second language. \n\n\nIf the\ninteractionist approach to language is correct, then the child may be\ndeprived of an environment of people to interact with apart from his language\nteachers. \n\n\nThis second language is also learnt rather\nthan acquired naturally because it is done in a classroom environment and may\nthus put off the child. \n\n \n\n\nQ3 \n\n\nIn the home environment,\nthe linguistic input for the child comes from the caregiver.\n\n\nIt also makes use of authentic situations and language\nis used as a means of communication rather than to develop the child\ncognitively or linguistically. \n\n\nThe caregiver is\nusually less concerned with the form that is produced but with the truth\nvalue. \n\n\nrather, the child is able to acquire the forms\nat his own pace and is not punished for the " incorrect" or deviant forms\nthat he produces. \n\n\nThe context of the home is also\ninformal. \n\n\nIn comparison, the setting of the school or\nclassroom is formal. \n\n\nThe teacher also has a planned\nsyllabus as to what linguistic items are to be taught for the week.\n\n\nIn Singapore, teachers enter all the linguistic items,\nsuch as spelling lists, use of past tense or the Perfect tense into their\nrecord books. \n\n\nThe lessons are then structured in a way\nwhereby all the linguistic input for the child comes in the form of the use\nof past tense, be it in story-telling, by rote or drills.\n\n\nThis is in opposition to the learner\'s syllabus that\nevery child has. \n\n\nAll the activities conducted in the\nclass will be towards the teacher\'s syllabus. \n\n\nInstead\nof an environment of love and acceptance, the child is subject to overt\ncorrection of his " mistakes", deviations from the norm.\n\n\nIn certain cases, the child may even be punished for\nsuch forms, such as not getting a " star" on his book. \n\n\nThe child is rarely praised if he produces the\ncorrect form yet punished if he does the opposite. \n\n\nThe learning that takes place is also not authentic as the child is required\nto give the correct form rather than the correct communicative act which is\nwhat the child is exposed to in the home environment. \n\n\nSchool also places a heavier emphasis on the written form than the spoken\nform. \n\n\nAt the age of 5 to 6, the child is merely at\nthe stage of concrete operations, according to Piaget, therefore, it may be\ndifficult for him to visualise any connection between the spoken and written\nas the latter is more abstract.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7b5fa5f4-847d-4dec-98ac-918ad68bc8e8', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.643223+00:00',

{'text': "Q2 \n\n\nCode switching refers to\nthe use of one or more languages within a speech event but across sentence\nboundary, that is codeswitching is an inter-sentential phenomenon.\n\n\nCode switching is frequently evident in informal speech\nsituations whereby one speaker wishes to acknowledge an element of solidarity\nand intimacy with another speaker or when the speaker belongs to a particular\ngroup whose members are adapt at and frequently codeswitch.\n\n\nIt may also be the case whereby a speaker wishes to be\nidentified as a member of a group or be accepted as a member of a particular\ngroup. \n\n\nHence code-switching is felt by many linguists\nto be motivated primarily by sociolinguistsic concerns whereby the topic,\nlocale, domain and role-relationship between participants play an extremely\nintricate role in the code-switching phenomenon. \n\n\nHence, some linguists may ask then what are the linguistic constraints of\ncode-switching if any and how, when, why and with whom does the\ncode-switching phenomenon occurs. \n\n\nThe broadest aspect\nby which one can formulate in sociolinguistic terms with regards to what\nhappens when speakers code-switch hence deals with the notion of when, why\nand with whom code-switching occurs. \n\n\nCode-switching\nunlike diglossia occurs frequently without the conscious knowledge of its\ninteractors so that if one were to ask a code-switcher after a speech event\nwhat particular variety of language he uses for the entire course of the\nspeech event, he frequently cannot tell which particular code he has used for\na particular topic of discussion during the speech event.\n\n\nAs has been mentioned, code-switching frequently occurs\nin informal situation whereby the aim of code-switching is primarily to\nindicate solidarity and intimacy between speakers. \n\n\nIt\nmay also be used to indicate depersonalization and objectiveness.\n\n\nIt may also be used to reaffirm a particular point\nmade. \n\n\nBesides, code-switching between speakers may\nalso be seen as a subtle attempt to exclude others in the speech event.\n\n\nAll these aspects refer to the sociolinguistic motive\nof code-switching. \n\n\nCode-switching, hence, is a\ncommunicative device used by speakers which in turn reflects upon their\nindividual creativity. \n\n\nIn Singapore especially,\ncode-switching is a common phenomenon be it for establishing distance or\nsolidarity and intimacy. \n\n\nBesides, in the Singapore\ncontext, the use of particles such as 'la', 'loh', 'hah' and a host of other\nparticles enhances the essence of code-switching in Singapore.\n\n\nSuch use of particles adds a unique flavour and colour\nto informal Singapore English. \n\n\nThese particles carry\nsemantic content and non-Chinese Singaporeans are also ( also) of its\nexistence, use and meaning conveyed. \n\n\nThese particles\nespecially, when used by code-switchers also establishes the intonation\npattern of the discourse and often lead to be a source of perplexity for non-\nSingaporean speakers of English especially with regards to the attitudes\nconveyed by code-switchers who use such particles. \n\n\nBesides, there is a host of non-verbal gestures that is used by\ncode-switchers too and these ) non-verbal gestures) often provide(s) an\nindication as to why they ( code-switchers) laugh at a particular point in\ntime of interaction while non-Singaporean users stand looking at them with\ndoubt. \n\n\nAgain, a sense of exclusion is established with\nregards to outsiders by code-switchers. \n\n\nHence, from\nthe above phenomenon mentioned with regards to the sociolinguistic aspects of\ncode-switching, it is evident that code-switching certainly plays an\nimportant role in present Singapore, especially among the younger generation\nof Singaporeans primarily to establish solidarity and intimacy or distance\ndepending on the context of situation. \n\n\nBesides,\nsometimes code-switching occurs because a particular topic is discussible??\n\n\nonly in a particular code X rather than code Y\nprimarily because code Y may lack the vocabulary core to handle it or the\ntopic is felt to be best if discussed in code X or may even because the\nspeakers are adapt(adept??) at handling that particular topic in code X.\n\n\nDomain also play an important role in the context of\ncode-switching. \n\n\nFrequently in formal situations and\nspeech situations, code-switching do not occur unless of course when the\nspeaker wishes to create humour or to put his intentions across to others\nmore succinctly(succinctly??). \n\n\nRole-relationship\nbetween speakers also determine whether code-switching occurs at all.\n\n\nFrequently, when interacting with persons of superior\nstatus with whom one is subordinate to, codeswitching is least evident.\n\n\nBesides, the other speaker's capability at\ncode-switching is taken into consideration too before any evident\ncode-switching phenomenon may occur. \n\n\nHence,\ncode-switching certainly does not mean following a fixed prescribed set of\nrules, it depends on situational norms to communicate metaphoric information\nabout how words are to be understood by others. \n\n\nhence,\nspeakers background knowledge, social presuppositions and context\nconstraints(constraints) all come into play as sociolinguistic considerations\nfor speakers when code-switching. \n\n\nCode-switching is\nnot simply a haphazard communicative phenomenon; it involves an acute grasp\nof the communicative norms existing in a particular society. \n\n \n\n\nQ4 \n\n\nCommunicative or\ndiscourse particles such as 'la', 'loh', 'meh' and a host of others play an\nintricate role in English spoken in Singapore. \n\n\nIn\nSingapore, there exist a speech continuum ranging from the highest that is,\nthe acrolect sub variety, followed by the upper and lower mesolect and\nfinally the lowest the sub-variety, that ism the basilect.\n\n\nThese communicative and discourse particles are most\nevident in the informal, communicative norm situation of Singapore.\n\n\nHence, in terms of the sub-varieties evident in\nSingapore's speech continuum, communicative and discourse particles are\nfrequently evident at the mesolectal and basilectal level of the speech\ncontinuum. \n\n\nThese communicative or discourse particles\nhave been claimed by some local linguists such as Mary Tay that they are\nderived from the Hokkien dialect of Singapore. \n\n\nHowever, due to Singapore's multi-lingual phenomenon, these communicative or\ndiscourse particles have been slowly assimilated by the various speech\ncommunities existing in Singapore such as the Malays, Tamils and other\ndialects of the Chinese community. \n\n\nIn fact, its use\nhave(has) expanded from intra-ethnic communication to inter-ethinic\ncommunication. \n\n\nIn Singapore, there is the L(Low) and\nH(High) variety of English and Mandarin. \n\n\nThe H(High)\nvariety of English or the acrolectal variety is used primarily for formal,\npublic and even formal writing(writing) situations. \n\n\nThe Low Variety of English is used also with its vernacular variety for\nintra-ethnic communication. \n\n\nThe Low variety (\nmesolectal and basilectal variety) is used for inter-ethnic communication as\nwell. \n\n\nIn Singapore, the H variety of Mandarin is used\nto link Singapore to China. \n\n\nThe L variety of spoken\nEnglish is used primarily to establish solidarity and intimacy hence\nminimising the social distance between interactors in a communicative norm\nsituation. \n\n\nThese use of communicative norm establishes\nthe situational and communicative needs of the speaker.\n\n\nThe use of communicative or discourse particles is\nattached to the low ( L) variety of spoken Singapore English to become L + la\nto enhance the solidarity and intimate feeling existing among or between\nparticipants in s speech situation. \n\n\nIt adds a distinct\nflavour of creativity, uniqueness, ingenuity and most important a\nself-identifying local variety of spoken Singapore English.\n\n\nThese communicative and discourse particles carry\nsemantic meanings and are known and used by members of other dialect groups\nas well. \n\n\nThe use of these communicative or discourse\ndevices depends on several socio-cultural factors and situations as well.\n\n\nit depends on situation, the role-relationship\nexisting between participants and the topic of discussion.\n\n\nHowever, it is most evident in situations of\ninformality and also between people of similar social ranks.\n\n\nIn a situation where one is subordinate to another,\nthe L + la variety is least likely to occur. \n\n\nThe la\nparticle usually occurs at the end of a phrase or sentence and its primary\nmotive is to establish solidarity, rapport, informality and familiarity.\n\n\nThese communicative or discourse devices have\nfrequently been labelled as code makers or code labels because they carry\npart of the meaning of the message and also identify the style of the\ninteraction. \n\n\nTheir effective use involves knowledge of\na set of socio-linguistic norms. \n\n\nFor example, persons\nwho are not knowledgeable with regards to the use of these communicative\ndevices may employ them in formal situations or may even adopt an incorrect\nchoice of these communicative devices for a particular situation.\n\n\nHence, owing to the existence of a continuum of speech\nvarieties in Singapore beside the fact that for most period of social\ninteraction among intra and inter-ethnic communities, the L + la variety is\nadopted to establish familiarity, solidarity, informality and rapport.\n\n\nThe use of these communicative or discourse particles\nhave thus become part and parcel of our communicative norm.\n\n\nThe creative aspect of the individuals derived through\nthe use of these communicative or discourse devices has indeed enabled\nSingapore to achieve the status of a distinct social entity in the eyes of\nforeign as well as local linguists. \n\n\nIn fact, there has\neven been local books written by local writers who use the communicative or\ndiscourse particles in their narratives. \n\n\nThis\ntechnique helps to enhance the flavour of Singapore writing.\n\n\nHowever, there are worries attached to this use of\ncommunicative or discourse devices especially with regards as to whether it\nwill lower Singapore standard of spoken English. \n\n\nNonetheless, I firmly feel that sociolinguists should study the communicative\nor discourse particles in the English spoken in Singapore because these\nparticles have become part and parcel and also an intricate part of our lives\nespecially in the area of communicative norm. \n\n\nit gives\nSingapore a sense of self identity and uniqueness not found in any other\nspeech communities outside of Singapore. \n\n\nTherefore,\nwhat better ways there are for sociolinguists to understand the inhabitants\nof Singapore and thus their use of language than through a study of the\ncommunicative norms of its people and this certainly involves a study of\nSingapore's communicative particles as well. \n\n \n\n\nQ6 \n\n\nBefore achieving\nindependence in 1965, Singapore has five major languages, namely, English,\nHokkien, Mandarin, Tamil and Malay. \n\n\nAfter attaining\nindependence, five out of the four major languages was given official status,\nnamely, English, Mandarin, Tamil and Malay. \n\n\nEnglish is\nchosen because of its important role in international trade while the other\nthree represent the major language of its inhabitants. \n\n\nMalay as the additional status of national language not because of majority\nof its people are conversant in Malay but because of its relations with the\nMalay world. \n\n\nHowever, what is interesting about the\nSingapore context is that English has begun to play a role of increasing\nimportance among its people. \n\n\nEnglish is taught\nprimarily in school and plays a role of utmost importance for interaction\nwith the outside world. \n\n\nIt also provides one with good\nopportunities in employment and in the commercial and business sectors.\n\n\nIn fact, English has acquired an extremely important\nstatus in Singapore through constant promotions and campaigns by its\ngovernment. \n\n\nThe government of Singapore hopes to\nattain a level of English in Singapore that is on par with that of the\nStandard British English. \n\n\nSingapore English differs in\nphonology and vocabulary with Standard British English but has ( Singapore\nEnglish) a close affinity in the area of grammar with Standard British\nEnglish. \n\n\nHence, it is in the area of phonology and\nvocabulary that Singapore's English establishes a clear mark from that of\nBritish English. \n\n\nIt is this area of phonology and\nvocabulary that Singapore culture comes into play. \n\n\nSingapore culture shapes and moulds its vocabulary and phonology.\n\n\nHence, due to Singapore's multilingual society, the\nculture of each major dialect group comes into play in shaping its vocabulary\nand phonology. \n\n\nSingapore English has in its vocabulary\ncore terms taken from background language. \n\n\nterms such\nas 'amah', 'towkay', 'kampung' and a host of others are derived from its\nmajor ethnic groups. \n\n\nBesides, the linguistic\nenvironment in which one is taught how to speak English also affects the\naccent of the learner. \n\n\nfor example, in the area of\nphonology, Standard British English has only 1 nucleus in a sentence but in\nSingapore English there are usually more than one. \n\n\nBesides, Singapore English tends to have no distinction between stress on\ndifferent categories of words ( 'increase' as verb and 'increase' as noun).\n\n\nSingapore English tends to be syllable timed.\n\n\nThese difference and a host of others are due\nprimarily from interference from one's own culture or even from other\ncultures with the community.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'Q1 \n\n\nClausewitz has been\nconsidered by many as a master strategist and foremost writer on war because\nof his wide understanding of the overall perspective of war.\n\n\nHe had been known as the philosopher of war.\n\n\nNot only did he view war in terms of operational\ntactics on the battleground, Clausewitz also encompassed the relevance of\nnational policy and the state in his writings. \n\n\nTherefore, he was able to link the relevance of politics and war together.\n\n\nIndeed, Clausewitz could be considered the master\nstrategist because some of his insights can be applied to modern war context.\n\n\nTo assess if Clausewitz\'s reputation is justified, I\nwill look at the major contributions of Clausewitz, the relevance of his\ntheories in today\'s context, and also compare him with other military\nstrategic thinkers. \n\n\nThe most striking feature of\nClausewitz\'s contribution, I feel, is his emphasis on total or absolute war.\n\n\nIn this, he mentioned that war can be viewed in 2\ndifferent ways. \n\n\nThe nature of war could be seen in\nterms of a total absolute war or a limited war. \n\n\nA\ntotal war would require devotion of massive resources by the state.\n\n\nThis would require the commitment of mass population,\nindustrial strength and resources. \n\n\nHe advocated the\nuse of total war because this would give a decisive impact on the procedures\nof war-making. \n\n\nA limited war would, on the other hand,\nrequire the commitment of resources sufficient just to achieve the main\nmilitary-political objective. \n\n\nAs such, this would not\nexhaust the total economy of the state. \n\n\nIn viewing\nClausewitz\'s idea, the use of absolute total war could be linked to the\npolitics-war relationship. \n\n\nThis means that Clausewitz\nrealized the importance of having full state control in deciding on a war.\n\n\nThe military, as expounded by Clausewitz, is\nsubordinated to the civilian state command. \n\n\nBecause\nthe military objective is part of the entire national objective, the military\nwill have to be subjected to state control. \n\n\nAs\nClausewitz understood, war is merely an extension of the state.\n\n\nTherefore, respect should be given to Clausewitz for\ncatalysing this understanding. \n\n\nAlthough Niccolo\nMachiavelli also propounded that war and state are inseparable, one must give\ndue recognition to Clausewitz for having related the close connection between\nstate national objective and military objective. \n\n\nAnother of Clausewitz\'s contributions would be his understanding of a certain\ndegree of friction when conducting a total war. \n\n\nHe\nmentioned that war is usually faced with a few inevitable frictional forces.\n\n\nFor instance, the physical exhaustion of the army\nforces would be a big hindrance to smooth war actions. \n\n\nBesides, there is the uncertainty and chance that one has to face in war-\nmaking. \n\n\nThis is kept very much to an unexpected turn\nof events because no one can ensure a smooth implementation of war actions.\n\n\nIn war, there is also a certain degree of the fear of\ndanger in troops. \n\n\nThis is a human factor not to be\ndiscounted with. \n\n\nAlso, the morale of the troops is a\nsignificant factor which can either make or break a successful war.\n\n\nIn pointing these factors of friction, Clausewitz had\nbeen effective in revealing the uncertainty of war. \n\n\nHe\nwas indeed a foremost writer on the actual apprehension of war.\n\n\nIn a way, he prepared the future generations in\nexpecting the worst that could emanate from a war. \n\n\nThe\nnext important idea of Clausewitz was the centre of gravity.\n\n\nIn this, Clausewitz mentioned that the most decisive\nand devastating act of a military force should be directed at the core of the\nenemy. \n\n\nThis nerve centre was considered by Clausewitz\nas the centre of gravity. \n\n\nTo him, this core was the\nmost important of the enemy\'s survival. \n\n\nIt could\nconstitute any form, for instance, the enemy\' industrial center, the enemy\'s\nmilitary forces, or the enemy\'s communication lines. \n\n\nAs such, the centre of gravity would differ from state to state.\n\n\nBut, ultimately, this was the most vital enemy point\nfor attack. \n\n\nIf a successful blow was rendered on this\ncore, the enemy would sustain much casualties, and hence would crumble in a\nshort period of time. \n\n\nThis theory, I feel, is one of\nClausewitz\'s strongest contributions. \n\n\nHe was right in\nidentifying such an important point for attack. \n\n\nThis\nfactor can be seen as relevant and practical in modern context.\n\n\nFor instance, the Gulf War, 1991 had demonstrated that\nthe U.S.-led allied forces had been attacking Iraq\'s nerve centre - the oil\nplants, the installation and ammunition centres. \n\n\nThe\nmain strategy of the Allied forces was to attack Iraq\'s vital survival\npoints. \n\n\nTrue enough, the devastation created by such\nan attack was decisive and overpowering, bringing Iraq to the negotiation\ntable. \n\n\nHence, Clausewitz\'s contribution of this \'centre\nof gravity\' idea can still be practised today. \n\n\nAnother\nof his ideas relevant today is the relationship between war and politics.\n\n\nInstead of resolving to war straightaway, the United\nStates decided to use diplomacy first. \n\n\nAs such,\nvarious rounds of diplomatic negotiations were held between Iraq and the\nmajor Western powers like the United States, and even the United Nations as a\nrepresentative body of the international realm. \n\n\nAs\nsuch, one can say that Clausewitz\'s ideas had been practical for his days,\nand even relevant for today. \n\n\nIndeed, he was a profound\nmaster strategist that propounded very realistic and practical theories.\n\n\nHowever, one misgiving about Clausewitz\'s theory is\nthe use of absolute war. \n\n\nIn today\'s world, not all\ncountries practise this theory. \n\n\nInstead of using the\nmilitary force as the backbone of supremacy and power, countries like Japan\nand Germany are using the economic tool to attain world status.\n\n\nTherefore, Clausewitz\'s idea of having a total war to\ngain superiority would be considered obsolete today. \n\n\nRegardless of this impractical theory found in the use of absolute war today,\nClausewitz\'s contributions are still considered impressive and significant.\n\n\nThe fact that the idea of the centre of gravity exists\ntill today, shows that Clausewitz was able to view war-making in an overall\nperspective. \n\n\nHis ideas showed his capacity in linking\nthe military/war effort with the wider scope of national state objective.\n\n\nIn this way, Clausewitz\'s perception was not confined\nto mainly a limited war zone or the tactical operations on the battleground.\n\n\nHence, I would consider Clausewitz\'s reputation as\nbased on firm foundation, and not that of being blown out of proportion.\n\n\nIn comparing with Jomini\'s narrow perspective,\nClausewitz appeared more efficient in encompassing the state into the arena\nof war-making decision. \n\n\nJomini mainly elaborated and\nemphasised on the lines of operation in the actual theatre of war.\n\n\nHis idea was concentrated on just the battlefield.\n\n\nThe zones of operations were seen as the most vital\nmaneuvering platform. \n\n\nIn a way, Jomini had viewed war\nin a limited and narrow scope. \n\n\nClausewitz, however,\ntranscended Jomini\'s perspective to include a wider scenario.\n\n\nIn comparing with Sun Tzu, the age-old Chinese\nstrategic thinker, Clausewitz was similar in raising the issue of war being\nclosely connected with politics. \n\n\nIndeed, there was a\nprofound importance in this because both of them had shown that war is not\nonly a military concern, but also a political commitment.\n\n\nThis political/military perspective was to later\ninfluence Mao Tsetung\'s revolutionary course in China. \n\n\nHence, Clausewitz\'s idea of politics and war could be said to have a\nrevolutionary character. \n\n\nAs such, his contributions\ncould be considered as a vital and significant one for the study of military\nhistory and strategic thought. \n\n\nIn conclusion, I feel\nthat Clausewitz deserves to be called a master strategist and foremost writer\non war. \n\n\nHe made unique contribution which were an\neye-opener to most military historians. \n\n\nIndeed, his\nreputation as a philosopher of war and a strategist is seen to be qualified.\n\n\nThe relevance of his theories also enhanced his\nreputation since it is based on firm conclusion that his theories are still\nbeing practised today by many military strategists. \n\n \n\n\nQ2 \n\n\nSun Tzu\'s writings are\nmost impressive in " The Art of War" which was written during the 4th century\nB.C. \n\n\nHis theories have been practised by contemporary\nrevolutionaries like Mao Tse-tung. \n\n\nHence, Sun Tzu\'s\nwritings are considered to be relevant even in today\'s context.\n\n\nHis understanding of the requirements of making a\nnon-violent war must be said to be the most impressive and significant.\n\n\nAs such, the merits of Sun Tzu\'s writings must be\nelaborated. \n\n\nFirst, although Sun Tzu\'s " The Art of\nWar" was written long time ago, he displayed profound understanding of the\nclose relationship between war and politics. \n\n\nFor\ninstance, Sun Tzu advocated that the art of war is actually to have no war.\n\n\nIf there is to be war ultimately, it should be\nconducted with little or no violence. \n\n\nTherefore, this\npreference for minimum violence can be said to have a lasting impact even up\ntill today. \n\n\nIn Mao Tse-tung\'s fight against the\nNationalists in China, he employed the strategy of relating political\nstruggle with military operations. \n\n\nTherefore, his\nrevolutionary war succeeded in gaining widespread popular support from the\npeasants with little or no violence at all. \n\n\nIt was\ntruly a practise of Sun Tzu\'s theory of conducting a war with not much\nviolence. \n\n\nAnother illustration of contemporary\npractise of Sun Tzu\'s teachings is the diplomatic and economic measures\nadopted by the Western powers against Iraq when it invaded Kuwait on August\n2, 1990. \n\n\nInstead of resorting to immediate war action\nto drive out the Iraqis, the Western Allied Powers decided to employ\nnon-violent means to oust the Iraqis. \n\n\nThus, economic\nblockades, economic sanctions and diplomatic negotiations were practised\nfirst. \n\n\nThis again paralleled Sun Tzu\'s idea of having\na war conducted with no war. \n\n\nThe relevance of Sun\nTzu\'s writings is therefore, certainly a great boost to Sun Tzu\'s reputation\nas having " eternal freshness". \n\n\nAnother of Sun Tzu\'s\ntheories explains the element of flexibility. \n\n\nSun\nTzu\'s understands that war is full of uncertainties. \n\n\nTherefore, the military operations and strategy adopted by any commander\nshould be flexible and adaptable to the changing conditions.\n\n\nTo elaborate further, Sun Tzu says that war is like\nwater. \n\n\nIt takes no fixed form, and therefore, has no\nconstant feature. \n\n\nThis is indeed a practical\napproach, especially if we scrutinize Mao Tse-tung\'s revolutionary war.\n\n\nInstead of adopting a fixed stand, or a fixed\nstrategy, Mao was flexible with his tactical operations against Chiang\nKai-shek\'s Nationalist Army. \n\n\nWhen losses seemed\nimminent, Mao would withdraw. \n\n\nThis enabled him to\nrecuperate at his base areas and to rebuild his army\'s strength again.\n\n\nHence, Sun Tzu\'s theory of flexibility and\nadaptability had inspired Mao to propound this exercise: \n\n\n " When the enemy advances, we retreat When\nthe enemy camps, we harass When the enemy tires, we advance When the enemy\nretreat, we pursue."   \n\n\nThis definitely,\nhad been influenced by Sun Tzu\'s ideas. \n\n\nBeing\nadaptable and flexible is still a relevant practise in today\'s war.\n\n\nSun Tzu also explained the importance of using\nintelligence, deception and secret agents. \n\n\nTo qualify\nthis, he mentioned that to win a war with minimal or no violence, one should\nunderstand the enemy\'s strengths and weaknesses. \n\n\nTo\ndo this, one must employ intelligence and secret agents.\n\n\nThis had been relevant in Mao\'s revolutionary course\nin China, when he utilised the peasant masses as part-time soldiers in the\nRed Guards. \n\n\nThese armed citizens would report to Mao\nand the Red Army ( full-time communist revolutionary fighters) about the\ntactics and operations of the Nationalist Army. \n\n\nSometimes, these Red Guards would also make minor ambushes and small-scale\nbattles on the Nationalists. \n\n\nHence, Mao enjoyed the\nsupply of information and knowledge by these easily accessible intelligence\nsources. \n\n\nIn a way, Mao\'s operations and strategy were\ngreatly influenced by Sun Tzu who believed that " All warfare is based on\ndeception". \n\n\nHe also would use decoy plans to " offer\nthe enemy a bait to lure him". \n\n\nIn Mao\'s writings, he\nshowed similar attitude when he said that " War demands deception".\n\n\nTherefore, Sun Tzu\'s writings showed a depth of\nunderstanding for the actual conduct of war, but deception can be a useful\nand effective tool to attain success. \n\n\nIndeed, Sun\nTzu\'s writings had shown great profundity and relevance in today\'s war. \n\n\nSun Tzu also advocated the emphasis on human factor.\n\n\nHe realized that the government should be a\npeople-oriented one; committed to the welfare of the masses.\n\n\nThis was clearly adopted by Mao who understood that\nto gain the people\'s sympathy and support, the main tool or plan would be to\nredistribute land to the people and reduce land rent.\n\n\nAfter gaining the people\'s support, Mao would then\nbe able to fight a " People\'s war" since China\'s population consisted of\nmainly agrarian peasants. \n\n\nTrue enough, this strategy\nworked for Mao, and he ultimately defeated the Nationalists in 1949.\n\n\nSun Tzu\'s writings therefore, revealed deep\ncomprehensiveness and understanding. \n\n\nHe seemed to be\nable to weave socio-political means into the conduct of war.\n\n\nThis capability of Sun Tzu therefore rendered him a\nthinker with profound insight and clearer vision. \n\n\nBesides these theories, Sun Tzu also denounced prolonged or protracted war.\n\n\nHe felt that to conduct a prolonged war would\nindicate that the strategy was not properly executed.\n\n\nThis would mean a failed mission.\n\n\nAlso, a prolonged war would cause one\'s own\nfinancial and resource base to be exhausted. \n\n\nThis\nwould ultimately affect one\'s own supply of resource and material.\n\n\nIt would also make better sense to adopt, imbibe a\nstill intact enemy territory than to take in a devastated one.\n\n\nTherefore, Sun Tzu\'s theory was clear in explaining\nthe relationship between the duration of a war and the economy of a state.\n\n\nThis idea can be seen as relevant in today\'s context\nbecause the American war in Vietnam demonstrated that a prolonged war would\nkill American public interest and finally affect public opinion about the\nwar. \n\n\nAlso, the financial drain suffered by the\nAmericans during and after the Vietnam War showed that Sun Tzu\'s theory is\nstill very much relevant today. \n\n\n" The Art of War" by\nSun Tzu, therefore, has very practical implications for today\'s context.\n\n\nSun Tzu\'s writings demonstrated deep understanding\nof the human mind, and clear comprehension of the relationship between\npolitics and war. \n\n\nIndeed, much of Sun Tzu\'s writings\nare relevant today. \n\n\nHis writings can be valued as\nthe most profound strategic thoughts, widely-read and practised today.\n\n\nAlthough written four thousand years ago, Sun Tzu\'s "\nThe Art of War" should not be dismissed as obsolete. \n\n\nOn the contrary, it showed great understanding for the very essence of the\nconduct of war.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source':

line.\n\n\nHope you caught enough sleep after the call and woke up in time for\nworship service.\n\n\nWas also surprised to learn that Philip told you I was not well.\n\n\nIt was thoughtful of him to keep you informed.\n\n\nIt was nothing serious, really.\n\n\nYou shouldn\'t be worrying about it at all.\n\n\nIn fact, don\'t worry too much about us in S\'pore.\n\n\nWe\'re amongst friends and relatives...\n\n\nyou\'re the one we should be worried about as you\'re away from home.\n\n\nGood thing your sis is loving and accommodating.\n\n\nYou\'ve not mentioned much about the other members in your sis\' house.\n\n\nHow are you getting along with them?\n\n\nYou mentioned that you were pretty shaken-up in the past weeks.\n\n\nWas it because of your mom\'s condition?\n\n\nWere there some other factors?\n\n\nIt\'s good that your buddies are still in touch with you.\n\n\nWe\'ve not met or heard from each other after your departure.\n\n\nHow are they?\n\n\nGary mentioned to you at the airport that he might visit you next\nyear: Has he decided?\n\n\nWell, as for the jogging, don\'t overdo it.\n\n\nYou know how bad your knee cap can become.\n\n\nThere are always other forms of exercises in order to keep fit.\n\n\nDon\'t hurt your knee just because both you and Thomas want to\ncompete.\n\n\nLeave it to your own discretion...you should know your own body\nbetter than anyone else.\n\n\nYou needn\'t be anxious about Soh Mui and I.\n\n\nMisunderstandings are bound to happen in any relationship, or\nfriendship for that matter.\n\n\nEven arguments and sometimes quarrels ( not that we have any yet) may\nbe healthy in the development of friendship.\n\n\nIt\'s all part and parcel of life.\n\n\nNo need to so quickly blame yourself for anything that happens\nbetween Soh Mui and I.\n\n\nWe are responsible to each other for our friendship; you are not\nresponsible to us.\n\n\nBut, please do not be mistaken, it\'s not that I do not appreciate\nyour good intentions, it\'s a matter of principle.\n\n\nIt\'s not just about forgiving and forgetting.\n\n\nThere is nothing to forgive or forget about, really.\n\n\nI\'ve been thru\' many friendships, well, most of us have.\n\n\nI\'ve seen the best and the worst and I\'m prepared for both.\n\n\nFriends disappoint and we disappoint our friends too.\n\n\nWe all have different expectations.\n\n\nIt has to be mutual for a healthy friendship to develop and grow.\n\n\nAnd, no one can tell any one else to comply with his/her\nexpectations.\n\n\nBy the way, what were you apologizing about ?\n\n\nBecause I was not informed about your mom\'s illness and\nhospitalization ?\n\n\nI really hope I\'ve not conveyed the wrong message.\n\n\nI\'m not a good communicator, and might have written something not\nmeant to mean what it looks like, or something which is open to\nmisinterpretation.\n\n\nWhatever it is, please be assured that I\'ve not taken offence for not\nbeing informed about your mom.\n\n\nIn one of your letters, you sounded very upset about not being\ninformed of your mom\'s operation and hospitalization and that you have to\nfind out about it from your eldest brother, Stephen.\n\n\nI felt obliged then, to explain that I was also unaware of the\nmatter.\n\n\nPerhaps, in my haste to explain myself, I\'ve caused some\nmisunderstandings.\n\n\nI really did not mind whether I was informed or not.\n\n\nThinking back, there was no reason why I should be so anxious in\nexplaining myself.\n\n\nMay be due to self-centredness; didn\'t want to be blamed for not\ninforming you.\n\n\nWell, if I\'ve caused any confusion, please accept my apologies.\n\n\nWhat have you planned for Christmas and New Year ?\n\n\nAnything exciting coming up ?\n\n\nHope you\'re not just burying your head in the books and not mingling\naround, getting to know more friends.\n\n\nIs PBC putting up anything special, like an evangelistic musical?\n\n\nWell, True Way will be putting up one on 20 and 21 December.\n\n\nThe theme is " The Reason for the Season".\n\n\nHopefully, I\'ll be able to bring one or two friends along.\n\n\nHave also bought some coupons for a Christmas fun fair which will be\nheld in Clementi from 21 24 Dec.\n\n\nThe fair is organised jointly by a church and the Community Chest.\n\n\nThe church ( St John\'s and St Margaret\'s) has planned various\noutreach programmes for the fun fair.\n\n\nI feel that it is a good effort.\n\n\nHearts are generally more open and receptive during the Christmas\nSeason.\n\n\nHopefully through this event, the seed of the Gospel may be planted\nin the hearts of many.\n\n\nI\'m planning to bring my mom to the fair.\n\n\nShouldn\'t be too difficult since it is not held in the premises of a\nchurch.\n\n\nShe\'s not likely to be converted in such an event, but at least,\nhopefully, she\'s going to have an enjoyable time and be more exposed to\nChristianity.\n\n\nI\'ve always had mixed feelings during this time of the year, with\nChristmas coming and the end of the year round the corner.\n\n\nAs people start to decorate and celebrate Christmas, I always feel a\ntinge of sadness amidst the festivities.\n\n\nDo they know what they are celebrating?\n\n\nDo they know where they are heading?\n\n\nMore personally, do I know where I\'m heading?\n\n\nSometimes I feel this sense of loss of direction, even loss of\nmeaning.\n\n\nBut, must man always find a meaning in what he does.\n\n\nIf not, he is merely existing for existing\'s sake.\n\n\nThere must be more to life.\n\n\nHope you do not find it shocking that I, a Christian, should be\nwriting this.\n\n\nMore importantly, hope I do not become your stumbling block.\n\n\nDoes it sound like I\'m giving up my faith?\n\n\nTo assure you, no.\n\n\nI believe in God from flowers and bees and birds, I know God exists.\n\n\nWhat is His purpose for me on earth?\n\n\nI do not want to blindly follow the currents of the world.\n\n\nBut, very often, I feel so helpless.\n\n\nIs it because I\'m not strong enough?\n\n\nInside me I know I\'ll never be satisfied until I find an answer.\n\n\nBut will I?\n\n\nMay be I\'m just too anxious, lacking in faith.\n\n\nMay be I should just live life as it comes, day by day.\n\n\nDo you know what you\'re living for?\n\n\nHope you don\'t find this question too personal.\n\n\nI\'m just throwing questions in the air...you need not answer the\nquestion.\n\n\nThis " year-end phenomena" has never bothered me this much in past\nyears.\n\n\nStrange.\n\n\nGuess it could be due to age.\n\n\nIt could be the cause of the pressing need to know where I\'m heading\nbefore I run out of time, before it is too late.\n\n\nI do not want to come to a stage when I look back and discover to my\nhorror that I\'ve wasted half my life doing what I should not or not supposed\nto do.\n\n\nLike the Book of Ecclesiastes says " for all is vanity and a\nstriving after wind".\n\n\nHm...\n\n\nMaybe, I\'ll be able to find some answers in the Book of\nEcclesiastes.\n\n\nMaybe I should not be too disheartened, for even the most wise of\nkings, Solomon, had similar feelings!\n\n\nIt\'s very likely that I may quit from my present job in NUS early\nnext year.\n\n\nI\'ve not decided what to do next.\n\n\nI may contemplate a drastic career change.\n\n\nI may also take a month or two\'s break, go on a tour before I start\nhunting for another job.\n\n\nHopefully I\'ll be able to strike a balance between economic survival\nand job satisfaction in the next job.\n\n\nChildcare may be one line that I may go into.\n\n\nI\'m fully aware of the drastic salary cut, so, before plunging into\nit, I may help out in a friend\'s childcare centre for a few weeks just to get\nsome first hand experience and find out if that\'s what I really want to do.\n\n\nYet another option is to go back to some fulltime studies.\n\n\nThis last option is more just a dream.\n\n\nWell, no harm dreaming at times.\n\n\nThis brings to mind the film " are to Dream".\n\n\nIn times like this, it takes a lot of courage to dream and realize\nthat dream.\n\n\nIt is 7:30 am, 20 Nov \' 91 today.\n\n\nI started writing this letter on the day you called, ie 10 Nov \' 91.\n\n\nLooks like I\'m writing a diary.\n\n\nWell better end here before it becomes an autobiography!\n\n\nHope you enjoy reading my nonsense.\n\n\nTake care.\n\n\nPal-in-Christ.\n\n\nMary \n\n\n\n\nDear Shanrui,\n\n\nIt was really sweet of you to write to me.\n\n\nI didn\'t expect you to keep in touch with me, but you did and you\'ve\nwritten two letters already and this is only my first.\n\n\nPlease pardon me for procrastinating.\n\n\nBelieve me, I had wanted to reply to your letters much earlier than\nnow but I just didn\'t get down to it.\n\n\nI know how lonely and homesick one can be when one is away from home\nbut still I\'ve shelved writing until now.\n\n\nI\'m mortified by this.\n\n\nI\'ll try to be more disciplined and faithful to write to you.\n\n\nWhat you wrote about Canada came as a surprise to me.\n\n\nMy impression ( not first-hand) is, I think, somewhat similar to\nyours before you flew there and saw with your own eyes, for the first time,\nwhat it\'s like.\n\n\nI guess it\'s time for me to see the place too.\n\n\nMy husband has a sister in the States and she\'s been asking us to\nvisit her.\n\n\nWe hope to be able to do so in not too distant a future.\n\n\nMaybe then we can also pay you a visit at Toronto, if the trip falls\nwithin the period you\'re there!\n\n\nTalking about trips, I\'ve been offered to attend the first workshop\non ICE stands for International Corpus of English and it\'s the project for\nwhich I\'m employed.\n\n\nAbout 22 countries are involved in this project which aims to create\na vast database of each of the national corpora of the English Language\nspoken and written in the member countries.\n\n\nBut I don\'t know how many of these countries will be represented at\nthe work shop.\n\n\nWe have to obtain our own funds, you see.\n\n\nAnd it is beginning to be quite apparent that the funds needed to\nsponsor me for this trip will not be coming in.\n\n\nI\'ve been told by one of the professors in this project team to be\nprepared to be disappointed.\n\n\nAnd I think I probably will.\n\n\nHe has done what he could but if the university does not want to\nsupport if by way of funds, then there\'s no way I can be on the plane to the\nNetherlands.\n\n\nThe team is still waiting for a final reply from the administration\nof this university but I\'m not optimistic.\n\n\nI was initially very excited about the trip but frankly, the\nexcitement has worn out now.\n\n\nI will be disappointed in that all probability be negative, but I\nwill not feel disappointed as my initial eagerness to go has diminished to a\nzilch.\n\n\nIt may not be worthwhile to go if the trip is offered with\nobligation, ie, you have to be bonded and work for them for a few years after\nthe trip because they sponsor you.\n\n\nAnd this thing about bond must not be taken lightly but be\napproached with caution and careful consideration.\n\n\nAnyway, nothing is finalised yet.\n\n\nI\'ll have to wait and see will keep you updated.\n\n\nI have something else to tell you but I\'ll reserve it for the next\nletter.\n\n\nNot that I fear a dearth of materials to write to you the next time\nbut I\'m afraid if I don\'t despatch this letter soon enough, you\'re going to\nreceive it probably a few weeks, if not months, later than originally\nintended.\n\n\nSo bye dor now ....\n\n\ner, I suppose I have to at least answer your 1 million dollar\nquestion you posed twice, in this letter, eh? \n\n\nWell, baby Lee is not in sight yet.\n\n\n\'Will let you know

{'text': "10.2.91\n\n\nHi Yeoh,\n\n\nIt's end of the year again.\n\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\n\nBeen busy lately ?\n\n\nMust be trying to finish up your thesis, isn't it ?\n\n\nI sent a birthday card to you and Christine, plus note to Samuel\nwondered whether you've received it ( it seemed that I must ask you every\ntime or else the same thing would happen).\n\n\nI've just attended my church camp in Port Dickson ( 4-8 Dec 91).\n\n\nIt was a good camp.\n\n\nI felt that our church are more united and there's a desire to be\nmore involved.\n\n\nI think it does help to have a full-time pastor.\n\n\nHe and his family came to join our church since Aug 91.\n\n\nThe camp was also an good opportunity for us to know them better and\nvice versa.\n\n\nMost of the time we had programmes, so I didn't had the opportunity\nto venture anywhere else.\n\n\nThe only available time to go to the 'Pasar Malam' was on Saturday\nafternoon.\n\n\nOn Saturday evening, we had an special night and all the groups had\nto come up with an advertisement for the products ( which was previously\nassigned to each group).\n\n\nOur group came in second.\n\n\nGuess what, our group name was called B3 Sheep ( Ba Ba Black Sheep) 'coz\nour theme for the camp was 'Shepherd, Sheep and Society'.\n\n\nWe even came up with a song sung to the tune of Christmas song about\nthe 3 Orient king ( can't remember the title of the song).\n\n\nI'm still quite busy at work.\n\n\nGuess there will always be things to do and deadlines to meet.\n\n\nToday, my boss just asked me to work on producing a booklet to teach\nusers how to use our online catalogue.\n\n\nIt may sound simple but there's going to quite a lot of things to do\ncoz I myself have to get myself to be familiar with the system first before I\ncan try to write anything.\n\n\nThen I got to get inputs from other people and collate everything\ntogether.\n\n\nAnd this is on top of what I have to do in my daily work.\n\n\nI still got to work on another of a publication on 'Effective\nTeaching Methods'.\n\n\nActually the bulk of the work for this project was done by my\nex-colleague and I only have to check on the citations and proof-read\neverything.\n\n\nBetter stop myself from 'Fa Lao Sao' ( can guess what is this ? ) -\nie letting off my frustrations.\n\n\nActually it's not too bad as I still enjoy my work very much.\n\n\nDid I tell you that I met Chin Hoong in Singapore ?\n\n\n( I think it was last month).\n\n\nWe had lunch at Wisma Atria.\n\n\nI was on night duty so I could meet her in the afternoon.\n\n\nShe was quite surprised that I cut my hair and it's now quite short\ncompared to when I was in Australia.\n\n\nActually I had this hairstyle since April.\n\n\nBet you haven't seen me in my short kinky hairdo.\n\n\nI had to change hair-dresser because my one could wouldn't want to\ncut my hair too short for me.\n\n\nSomehow he had this impression that I would look better if my hair is\nlonger.\n\n\nDo you think that guys generally prefer women to have longer\nhairstyles ?\n\n\nThen, they would look more feminine.\n\n\nI haven't got any photographs with my 'new' hairdo, so I can't let\nyou comment.\n\n\nSo much about myself.\n\n\nHow are you going to spend your Christmas ?\n\n\nIf you haven't finished your thesis, maybe this should be your target\nto finish before Christmas.\n\n\nPerhaps you would be in a mood to celebrate and enjoy yourself.\n\n\nAre you plans for next year fixed ?\n\n\nI suppose you would be going to Hawaii to present your conference\npaper and then, what else ?\n\n\nKeep me updated, will you ?\n\n\nThe last time that I wrote, I was so sleepy and could barely keep\nmyself awake.\n\n\nWell, at least today I could manage to write quite a long letter.\n\n\nIt's already 11.30 pm.\n\n\nBetter get to bad fast.\n\n\nHave really got to stop here.\n\n\nBye.\n\n\nTake care.\n\n\nSend my regards to Stephanie.\n\n\nWill you be going to see her in Melbourne ?\n\n\nOK, OK Bye ( this time for real!).\n\n\nMee Lan \n\n\n\n\nDear Suet,\n\n\n11/12/91\n\n\nHi, long time no see, no hear.\n\n\nAs I write this note to you, I'm wondering whether we would 'cross'\nagain just as the last 2 times.\n\n\nIt seemed that we just would write to each other and ended up\ncrossing each other.\n\n\nI remembered that I just sent my last letter and one or 2 days later,\nI received your letter.\n\n\n( Now, I don't know where I placed your last letter, hmm, let me see,\ngot to dig it up among my files of things).\n\n\nYou can guess how late am I in writing and replying letters to\npeople.\n\n\nOn the 4th - 8th Dec, we had our church camp.\n\n\nI guess on the whole, many of us felt ministered to and I personally\nfelt motivated to pray more for my parents/friends salvation and do something\nabout it.\n\n\nYou asked in your last letter about whether how I felt about being in\nchurch.\n\n\nThis year.\n\n\nWell, at first I felt lonely at times as many of my close friends\nhave left or not in church.\n\n\nPeople like Siew Hong ( who got married) and you ( being away), Wei\nTse ( she hasn't been attending any church since early this year.\n\n\nAt first her grandma got a stroke and was hospitalised and then her\naunt got cancer.\n\n\nHave been trying to encourage her to get back to church, so far not\nsuccessful yet.\n\n\nDo pray for her).\n\n\nOthers were either too busy or have no time for me.\n\n\nI was not working until April.\n\n\nHad a lot of time to laze around but no money to spend.\n\n\nCan't go out too often.\n\n\nLater when I started work, was and still is quite busy at work.\n\n\nMaybe I have been too busy and haven't been making much effort to try\nto foster and deepen relationships with other people in church.\n\n\nShould try hard next year.\n\n\n15.12.91\n\n\nGot started writing this letter again.\n\n\nIt seemed that what I wrote ( above) was quite pathetic, isn't it?\n\n\nWell, it isn't so bad.\n\n\nOf course, there are times when I hot to know some other people\nbetter, like Sharon, Kim Lian, Wendy.\n\n\nI'm also quite excited about what's happening in church.\n\n\nI can 'feel' that more are ready to serve and be involved.\n\n\nThere is a sense of unity and concern among the members.\n\n\nOne applications that I would like to do is to make an effort to keep\nyou both updated about what's happening in church and perhaps try to send you\nthe church bulletins.\n\n\nPerhaps, this would better prepare you both for your return to\nSingapore.\n\n\nYou're planning to come back in June next year, isn't it?\n\n\nMy work in the library is getting to be more busy as I take on more\nresponsibilities but I'm still enjoying what I'm doing.\n\n\nRight now I'm also trying to learn about a new database management\nsystem call 'Paradox 3' and also trying to compare with 'Quattro Pro' (\nspreadsheet system) as I wanted to work on putting some data that I have into\na system which I can retrieve easily.\n\n\nSo I'm staying back after office hours to work on it.\n\n\nActually, I'm learning these computer programs out of my own benefit\nand is not required by my job.\n\n\nBut I like it.\n\n\nMaybe I should try to work towards this area of work.\n\n\nThis Christmas, our church is going to have a service during\nChristmas day itself as well as carolling ( to visit the shepherd groups).\n\n\nThere is going to be a Thanksgiving service on New Year's Eve.\n\n\nNext year, we are also have a prayer meeting ( once every month\nwhere everyone is supposed to attend and is chaired by the pastor).\n\n\nSo far for the 2 prayer meetings, there are about over 30 people\nattending.\n\n\nIt had been very encouraging indeed because in the past two years or\nso, it had been very difficult to get people to come for the prayer meetings.\n\n\nOK time to stop.\n\n\nWish you all the best for the coming year and have a blessed\nChristmas.\n\n\nBye.\n\n\nLove\n\n\nMee Lan\n\n\nP/S I'm sending you the Christmas cantata brochure ( which some of\nour church people were involved in) and today's bulletin to you). \n\n\n\n\nHi May Lee\n\n\n15.12.91\n\n\n'Blessed Christmas and New Year'.\n\n\nHope I'm not too late.\n\n\nBeen busy trying to rush out Christmas cards and letters which are\nlong overdue.\n\n\nHow's the weather in Melbourne now?\n\n\nHot and cold and hot again?\n\n\nI would think so, that's why I still prefer Sydney!\n\n\nYes, I think I'm still bias and have fond memories of my stay there.\n\n\nThough I'm now not as keen on migrating there as before.\n\n\nI think it's because I'm more settled now and the situation in\nAustralia isn't that good at the moment.\n\n\nPoor Bob Hawke, this Christmas wouldn't be fun as he faces much\npressure to resign.\n\n\nMaybe he really should rather than stay on clinging on to his power.\n\n\nPaul Keating, I bet, would be waiting anxiously to take over the\nprime ministership.\n\n\nThe unemployment rate is at its worst in 60 years.\n\n\nEveryone over there must be quite anxious about the economy and the\npolitical situation.\n\n\nBy the way, I don't think you've told me which university that\nyou're going to for your Masters course.\n\n\nWould it be RMIT?\n\n\nThen you would have lots of opportunity to meet Bee Ang.\n\n\nWe started to put up the Christmas tree and decorations in office.\n\n\nBoth Dahlia and myself put up the Christmas display and we both\nquite like it.\n\n\nThe theme is also related to 'environment-friendliness'.\n\n\nSo we put up a tree with birds flying everywhere ( Dahlia made them\nall and they are very nice).\n\n\nThere's 3-D effect as we put newspapers to make the tree think and\nbranches have more body and we also cut out different shapes and shades of\nleaves to make up the rest of the tree.\n\n\nrest of the panel were mostly recycled Christmas cards.\n\n\n( from previous years).\n\n\nQuite surprisingly, many people were staring more at the cards than\nthe tree.\n\n\nThe Christmas decoration along Orchard Road is O.K.\n\n\nNot very outstanding.\n\n\nYesterday I was in Orc.\n\n\nRd at about 9:30 pm, it was still very crowded.\n\n\nI' haven't really done very much of Christmas shopping.\n\n\nWaiting for the bonus to come.\n\n\nOh yes, only 3 more days to go.\n\n\nBet everyone in office is waiting for this day.\n\n\nOK got to stop here.\n\n\nBye for now.\n\n\nEnjoy your first Christmas in Australia and tell us what you did,\nwon't you?\n\n\nBye.\n\n\nLove\n\n\nMee Lan \n\n\n\n\nDear Melissa\n\n\n16.12.91\n\n\nHi again, Christmas is just around the corner.\n\n\nWhat will you be doing.\n\n\nIn fact by the time you received this letter, it might even be over.\n\n\nI guess you will spend your holidays with your parents.\n\n\nI don't have much plans for the Christmas period.\n\n\nOur church will be having a Christmas service on the day itself.\n\n\nAs usual, the youth group in my church is organising carolling but I\ndon't think I will join them.\n\n\nI actually had my holidays.\n\n\nI was in Malaysia in a place called Port Dickson for our annual\nchurch camp ( like the MYC but on a much smaller scale).\n\n\nThere were about 80 people including over 15 kids of all ages.\n\n\nWe were there from 4th-8th Dec.\n\n\nRight now, it's my colleagues' turn to have their holidays while I\nhave to stay in office to manage the ? ? .\n\n\nOn the 18th ( 2 more days to go), I'll be getting my salary\nincluding my long-awaited bonus.\n\n\nI had already started planning on what sort of things I would like\nto buy or how much to save.\n\n\nEven though the amount that I received seemed a lot but after\ndeducting everything, there's nothing much left. \n\n\nAt least one thing I can XX myself is that I will be getting my\nannual increment on Jan next year.\n\n\nAs for things in office, most of the work are getting more routine.\n\n\nI've also been given special projects to do.\n\n\nOne of which is to come out with a special publication on how to\nuse our OPAC system ( called LINC - Library Integrated Network Catalogue).\n\n\nSupposed to be out by June next year.\n\n\nBut I haven't got very much knowledge in this area.\n\n\nIn fact I've just borrowed 2 books on OPAC and hope to get myself\nmore familiar with the systems and the general capabilities of OPAC.\n\n\nI've been trying to learn a database management system called\nParadox in office as I wanted to create a database for some information that\nI wanted to retrieve easily rather than browsing through many pages.\n\n\nHowever a number of the fields are repeated and I'm wondering\nshould I be using a spreadsheet instead so that I can copy some of the data\nfrom cell to cell rather than tying them over and over again.\n\n\nActually I've not actually looked into the possibility of whether\nParadox has the ability to copy information from one field to another field\nin another record.\n\n\nMaybe I should do it before trying out the spreadsheet.\n\n\nI was quite excited about learning this new database that I had\nbeen staying back late in office for the last 4 days ( last week).\n\n\nI ended up going home at about 8 pm almost every night.\n\n\nIn the end I was quite tired considering we always had quite hectic\nschedules and having to be at the information counter for half the day.\n\n\nBetter take care of myself before I fall sick.\n\n\nGot to stop here.\n\n\nHey, better drive more carefully now.\n\n\nIt must be quite scary to be involved in any accident.\n\n\nMust be really thankful that no one was hurt.\n\n\nBye.\n\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\n\nMeeLan", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1319da31-c669-4d11-a33e-d1687ca79267', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.648012+00:00', 'english_score':

difficult moments, but on the\nwhole, a year I\'ve enjoyed, learned new things and grown ( for the better, of\ncourse).\n\n\nOnly bumped into Hwee Choo and boyfriend once.\n\n\nThink they attend 1st service.\n\n\nI attend 3rd mostly.\n\n\n" Pals" of my age - I meet them and catchup at people\'s wedding.\n\n\nBut still talk like old friends once we hit off.\n\n\nFrom your sharing - you sound purposeful with what you want to do\nwith yourself.\n\n\nGd!\n\n\nAlways be teachable and always concern yourself with the right thing\nat the right time.\n\n\nGuess studies, at the time of your writing, is such an oppressive\nburden.\n\n\nSounded unhealthily worried and nervous I hope it\'s just that moment.\n\n\nIf it is preoccupying more and more, like as if heading for nervous\nbreakdown, then seek help from people who can help.\n\n\nSometimes, difficulties with studies may due to ineffective and\ninefficient study skills and methods.\n\n\nIt\'ll be good to do some research, I mean read up, about study skills\nand methods, and see if yours can be improved on.\n\n\nBooks can be found in National Library - ask info.\n\n\nCounter for help if necessary.\n\n\nAbove all, enjoy and unwind this vacation.\n\n\nLearn to relax healthily.\n\n\nYou seemed stressed.\n\n\nIf you\'ve friends who want to have a meaningful Christmas, \'cos they\nnever know one before, make a date and come down to FCBC\'s " Come Celebrate\nChristmas".\n\n\nThis season is always full of opportunity to tell people of God\'s\nLove and Christ.\n\n\nFCBC is excitedly preparing for it this period.\n\n\nAm personally excited too.\n\n\nHappy hols and blessed Christmas!\n\n\n\n\npohlian\n\n\nP/S: Rec\'d your " Thank you" card.\n\n\nLike I\'ve always tell myself, as long as I\'ve done my best, I won\'t\nrebuke myself and know that I\'ve pleased God, myself and my parents since\nit\'s the best that I\'ve given.\n\n\nSo if you\'ve given what you can, go and have this holiday with a free\nspirit. \n\n\n\n\nDear Indra,\n\n\nThanks ever so much for your letter, you were right I was getting a\nlittle worried that you had forgotten all about me.\n\n\nActually, I wrote you another letter but I brought these aerogrammes\ntoday and decided to use these instead, from now on.\n\n\nMy budget is getting too tight, Mary still haven\'t sent me the money\nshe owes me.\n\n\nI\'m beginning to hate her more and more.\n\n\nI hope I get it before the end of this month or else I\'m going to\nsend her a nasty postcard, maybe her dad might see it.\n\n\nCollege is fine, making more friends.\n\n\nGetting pretty fed up and bored hanging out with the fat Spanish girl\nJudith and the dim black girl, Hazel from Slough.\n\n\nJudith likes this Spanish guy Freddy in our econs and stats class.\n\n\nShe takes French with him too and whenever he joins us at the table\nshe cuts me out totally by rattling away in Spanish.\n\n\nHe is nice and always chats with me and sits next to me in the stats\nclass, which she doesn\'t take.\n\n\nAs for Miss Slough, she is really weird and quite dumb.\n\n\nYou can look at her and ask her a question and she just gives you a\nblank stare.\n\n\nWell I\'m getting more friendly with these 3 girls who are in most of\nmy classes, Miki ( Japanese) Kana ( ? ) and a Malaysian girl who hangs out\nwith them, smiles a lot too.\n\n\nProbably better to start hanging out with them.\n\n\nMuch nicer not jealous or dim ( respectively for Judith and Hazel).\n\n\nIt\'s only a month and I can\'t stand same people but you would react\nthe same way if you were me.\n\n\nAnyway all else aside I love going to college hitting the books.\n\n\nI\'m quite into it right now.\n\n\nI\'m even taking a side course in Western Civilization in Medieval and\nRenaissance history.\n\n\nIt\'s a real change from the other tasteless business subjects.\n\n\nAnita is alright.\n\n\nI was down with the flu for 2 weeks and she was sweet to see to me\nbut ended up getting the flu herself, so I had to look after her in return.\n\n\nI\'m also pleased to inform you that she lives on the 7th floor and me\non the 2nd, in a way it\'s good because we don\'t see so much of each other so\nwe avoid a lot of conflicts.\n\n\nBut I go up to her room every evening to watch a little TV or she\ncomes down for short visits, usually to have a cigarette.\n\n\nSo Prof.\n\n\nThumboo wants you to work for NUS Theatre.\n\n\nHow very interesting, make sure they pay you a good salary because I\ncan foresee a lot of work dumped your way.\n\n\nBeware!\n\n\nShould they require a temporary clerical assistant or whatever from\nMay to August be sure to keep me in mind.\n\n\nYes, I\'m coming home for the summer.\n\n\nYah!\n\n\nI\'m dying to see you again to resume the Sunday nights at Emerald\nHill, our own secret corner, just like when we were children, though we never\nplayed together but you knew what I mean.\n\n\nI heard that Allysan\'s engagement party was very traditional.\n\n\nSam wrote to me about and she said she was somewhat surprised that\nthere were Indian women with trays of gifts lining up outside my house.\n\n\nSo weird!\n\n\nAs for my father\'s behaviour, I\'m not the least surprised.\n\n\nHe always puts his pride above all else even at the expense of\nAllysan\'s happiness.\n\n\nI hope that Allysan and Sinder will get married and be happy.\n\n\nIt\'s amazing that they\'ve lasted this long.\n\n\nHow is Shareen and Alvin these days, my eldest sister never writes.\n\n\nI\'ll have to deal with her when I come home.\n\n\nGetting a fucking job here is impossible, anyway it\'s much better to\ncome home for the hols.\n\n\nPlease don\'t tell anyone that I\'ll be home in mid may cause the fewer\npeople who know it, the better.\n\n\nSlowly I\'m cutting off ties with a lot of friends at home.\n\n\nAs for Mary, it\'s definitely the end, maybe not altogether but it\'s\ndefinitely going to be at that superficial stage once I come home.\n\n\nMuch like how is it with Jacqueline, Susanna and Grace.\n\n\nSad isn\'t it?\n\n\nBut frankly I don\'t care.\n\n\nI\'ll always have good friends like Monica, Martini, Lynn etc not\nforgetting my family, Sam you and my other cousins.\n\n\nWah!\n\n\nSo drama.\n\n\nI\'m happy to hear that your GRE went all.\n\n\nSo I guess it\'ll be Hello!\n\n\nAmerica in 1994.\n\n\nI may be able to get that exchange programme I applied for in Chicago\nas I\'m not at EBS doing languages so Regent\'s College say I can apply.\n\n\nIn case you\'ve confused RC houses e EBS, School of Counselling\nPsychotherapy, College of Radiology, Bell lust of languages.\n\n\nVery diversified and you have a wide choice of schools of learning.\n\n\nRC is opening a new faculty next term, they only have arts and\nsciences and they are introducing LLB ( law) into the curriculum.\n\n\nNot that I\'m any interested but you\'ll be sure that we\'ll be getting\na fair share of \'big mouths\'.\n\n\nWent to the library yesterday and had to change my Student\npass/library card whatever and the guy at the desk teased me.\n\n\nHe said you want to change your EBS card to RC generated then what\nabout next month, Bell lust etc.\n\n\nCheeky Bastard.\n\n\nBeen eating hellava lot lately, too much if you ask me.\n\n\nBe prepared to see me come home a fat bitch and leave home again a\nscarecrow.\n\n\nI put on and lose weight like a pendulum.\n\n\nBut I get so bored and too expensive to go out so I borrow a library\nbook and pig out all the time.\n\n\nSad huh!\n\n\nI\'m pleased to say I got an \'A\' on my first Business English paper,\nbelieve it on the environment and a \'B\' in my Statistics.\n\n\nI hope I can do as well for my economics, history and computing.\n\n\nI enjoy computer lessons the most, even if it\'s the most tedious,\nthe lecturer is a real nice lady.\n\n\nShe\'s also my tutor.\n\n\nShe\'s a block lady in her mid thirties.\n\n\nVery, very patient and understanding.\n\n\nHad brunch with Marcella last Saturday.\n\n\nShe called me over to her place down the street.\n\n\nThen we went to see a photography exhibition on pre and postwar\nFrance.\n\n\nIt was really interesting.\n\n\nShe\'s not quite as ambiguous now, thank goodness!\n\n\nShe off to Venice this week to meet some French/Persian guy.\n\n\nWah!\n\n\nsome people have all the luck.\n\n\nAnna was ill last week so I didn\'t see her.\n\n\nDidn\'t see Sharon last week either as she\'s works all the time, the\npoor thing.\n\n\nWell, hope I didn\'t bore you.\n\n\nDo write as often as you can.\n\n\nI miss you very, very, very much.\n\n\nTake care.\n\n\nLove, Stacy \n\n\n\n\n20 June 93\n\n\nDear Chris,\n\n\nIt was good to speak with you and to have the chance to be your\nguest at lunch.\n\n\nDo keep in touch.\n\n\nSo far the Planned Parenthood Association has not decided on the\ndate for the volunteer training programme for resident speakers.\n\n\nI will be happy to take care of your

me tell you about my new place.\n\n\nIt\'s a 2 bedroom unit with a tiny little backyard and located very\nclose to downtown.\n\n\nIn fact I take the cable car to the train station everyday.\n\n\nI\'m

quite shock to learn that Pastor Mark is still in Perth.\n\n\nI thought he was supposed to go to Adelaide to assist Reverend\nPowell?\n\n\nI heard about his plans to study in the States too, perhaps

{'text': "Dear Woon Boon,\n\n\n25-7-92\n\n\nWas really thrilled to receive your 3-page letter.\n\n\nLectures for my MA programme has already begun.\n\n\nPhonetics + Socioling are the 2 killers.\n\n\nFor Phonetics, the lecturer gives us a test each session, will choose\n7 out of 10 for the 20% CA.\n\n\nTerror isn't it, sounds like Aristar Tony doesn't it?\n\n\nFor Socioling, we've got this British lady lecturer, renown for\nfailing students.\n\n\nShe's such an awful lady, during the 1st session, she started by\ntelling us that we could fail our CA if we get our referencing wrong!\n\n\nMy course mates are all mature students in their 30's or 40's + she\nis treating us like a bunch of naive students.\n\n\nYet to meet the lecturer for Psycholing.\n\n\nHeard he is from US - a visiting lecturer.\n\n\nAs for Grammar, he is very clear in his explanation and is willing to\nnegotiate with us as to what we want in our course.\n\n\nSo far, the best.\n\n\nThe saucy news about Alan - is it just a rumour?\n\n\nHe's got 2 very adorable children.\n\n\nWon't understand why he is doing that cause that would ultimately\nruin his family.\n\n\nAs for Shelly, his lectures are always profound and difficult to\nfollow, especially when he goes into logic + Maths.\n\n\nJust hang in there, at least, you could negotiate with him, just put\non a pathetic look and he'll reward you according to your effort.\n\n\nTrust me, I've done that b4.\n\n\nJust show him that you are putting in a lot of effort and going\nthrough a lot of pain to understand his lectures.\n\n\nSad to hear that the Eng Service of BPC WA isn't doing too well.\n\n\nI heard that the congregation holds differing views in some doctrinal\nissues.\n\n\nWell, can only commit the church to the Lord.\n\n\nI am now preparing + busily rehearsing for a Musical 'Elijah' which\nwould be held at the SLF auditorium from 1-3 Aug.\n\n\nSamuel is in it too.\n\n\nClasses for 1st year NUS students will start on Wed 29/7.\n\n\nTherefore will be meeting them.\n\n\nLooking forward too.\n\n\nI'll be taking 2 groups, one on Weds and another on Fris.\n\n\nI'll be teaching 6 hrs per wk at NUS.\n\n\nAs for S'pore Poly, I am also taking 2 groups, a total of 4 hrs per\nwk.\n\n\nThis is just nice as a lot of intensive reading has to be done for my\nMA course.\n\n\nPlease send my warmest wishes to Kevin + Jenny on their wedding.\n\n\nIncidentally, Ang Shiuh + Chui Hwah are getting married today.\n\n\nWill be attending their wedding later at Calvary Pandan.\n\n\nAs for your dissertation, I feel you should work on something where\nyou could get adequate materials from.\n\n\nPerhaps you should fly back to S'pore because quite a fair bit has\nbeen written on Singlish and dialects.\n\n\nNo my reservist was not OK.\n\n\nI hate it.\n\n\nI am trying desperately to get downgraded.\n\n\nThank God for seeing me through those 2 wks which seemed like 2\nyears.\n\n\nGotta go.\n\n\nTake care.\n\n\nPaul \n\n\n\n\nDear Woon Boon,\n\n\nThanks for your prompt reply and for filling me as to what's\nhappening at UWA.\n\n\nGuess I am quite settled at NUS.\n\n\nI am beginning to enjoy the courses here.\n\n\nI've learnt a lot in terms of Phonetics, not through the lectures but\nreading.\n\n\nThe lecturer is quite unsystematic, makes you even more confused when\nhe answers your question and he is also quite obstinate.\n\n\nHe doesn't even give lecture handouts.\n\n\nSometimes I wonder whether his lectures are worth going.\n\n\nSad to hear that something 'extra' has crept into Alan's life.\n\n\nI really wonder how anyone could ruin his own happiness - if you've\nseen his son's picture, you'll realise how adorable he is - big bright eyes\nand a cute smile.\n\n\nSomehow I get the feeling that the Linguistics Dept is getting less 'personal'\never since it expanded.\n\n\nWhere has Shelley gone to?\n\n\nAlthough I get quite confused during his lectures I feel that he is\nquite lenient when it comes to grading.\n\n\nTrust him to be the mass media.\n\n\nI could tell that Shelley can never keep a piece of juicy news to\nhimself.\n\n\nHow's Jenny + Kevin's wedding?\n\n\nWhen's yours coming?\n\n\nAre you coming back to S'pore at the end of the year or only after\nconvocation?\n\n\nCelia should have completed her studies.\n\n\nI heard from her bro, she went to the East.\n\n\nHow's good old Perth, any changes?\n\n\nPraise God, the Elijah musical went on quite well despite some set\nback, like the sound system wasn't working well on the 1st night, some\ndifficulties with the Ministry of Infor and the Arts in terms of licence etc.\n\n\nA BBQ will be held this Sat and a thanks giving dinner next Fri.\n\n\nLooks like quite a lot of fun.\n\n\nLooking forward to meeting up with you again.\n\n\nTake care.\n\n\nPaul \n\n\n\n\nDear Woon Boon,\n\n\nThanks for your card.\n\n\nIt was really a pleasant surprise.\n\n\nHow did the first semester go?\n\n\nAny new lecturer?\n\n\nRight now ( for the month of June) I am conducting GCE 'O' LEVEL\nIntensive Englsih course for RELC.\n\n\nI am taking 3 classes therefore my working hrs are Mon, Wed, Fri (\n9-12, 2-5) Tue, Thur, Sat ( 2-5).\n\n\nI can't breathe!\n\n\nThank God that the course ends this Sat ( 27/6).\n\n\nCome July, I will be tutoring at NUS, at the Eng Lang Proficiency\nCentre.\n\n\nNgee Ann Poly and S'pore Poly are offering me some hrs too.\n\n\nTherefore I am likely to reject one of the 2 Polys.\n\n\nI think I won't be able to cope.\n\n\nMy time-table for MA ( Eng Lg) is as follows: Mon, Tues, Wed from\n6pm-8pm.\n\n\nLooking forward to meet my students undergrads 1st yr.\n\n\nIn fact, I am rather apprehensive, will I be able to cope?\n\n\nPardon my ignorance, how far North is Derby from Perth?\n\n\nGlad to know that Keith's got a job there.\n\n\nPraise the Lord cause the recession in Australia is really bad.\n\n\nHas Matthew Sim got a job yet?\n\n\nHow are the YFers?\n\n\nWas there a church camp recently in June?\n\n\nHow's Pastor Mark & Grace?\n\n\nSend my regards to them.\n\n\nPlease send my regards to the YFers.\n\n\nHave Kevin & Jenny got married yet?\n\n\nSend my blessings to them too.\n\n\nHow's Alan and Shelley?\n\n\nHow's the Honours programme UWA.\n\n\nDo you have a lot of seminars and presentations?\n\n\nHow's your brother coping at Murdoch?\n\n\nIs he enjoying himself?\n\n\nDo write to me and let me know your dissertation topic.\n\n\nFor me it will either be a comparison btw Malay + Chinese students\nin the learning of EL or a comparison btw Technical + Arts students in the\nlearning of EL.\n\n\nWell, Woon Boon, send my regards to Keith and I hope that the Lord's\nblessings will be upon both of you.\n\n\nTake care.\n\n\nPlease write.\n\n\nRegards.\n\n\nPaul \n\n\n\n\nDear YFers,\n\n\nTime flies and I have been back in Singapore for more than a year.\n\n\nAlthough 1991 has not been plain sailing, I would like to thank the\nLord for seeing me through, providing His strength, grace and mercy in\ndifficult times.\n\n\nThe job market at the beginning of 1991 was quite bad, due to the\nGulf crisis.\n\n\nNevertheless, the Lord provided me with many tutoring jobs and I was\nrelief teaching at Jurong Institute, a Pre-U Centre.\n\n\nI really enjoyed teaching and interacting with young adults, for my\npupils are at least seventeen years old.\n\n\nIn June, despite my tight budget, I was able to visit Hong Kong for\nsix days.\n\n\nThank God for providing financially.\n\n\nOn 1 July 1991, I started lecturing at the Language and\nCommunications Department of Singapore Polytechnic.\n\n\nI have students from various departments, such as, Building, Civil,\nElectrical and Mechanical Engineering.\n\n\nI enjoy teaching here ( though some of the students are a pain) and\nderive much satisfaction.\n\n\nCome July this year, I will begin my Master of Arts programme in\nEnglish Language at the National University of Singapore.\n\n\nThis is a one year fulltime course with nine units to be completed\nand a twentythousand word dissertation to be submitted.\n\n\nI am now having second thoughts as I feel that this crash course may\nkill my interest in the subject.\n\n\nTherefore, I am seeking the Lord's will as to whether I should\npursue a twoyear Master of Applied Linguistics course at Monash University.\n\n\nDo keep this item in your prayer list too, as I make this important\ndecision.\n\n\nI am now attending Mount Carmel BP Church.\n\n\nI must say that spiritually I am quite dry, though I do my quiet\ntime and pray regularly.\n\n\nMy greatest challenge this year is to complete reading the Bible\nonce.\n\n\nAs the academic year is about to begin, I pray that God will provide\nyou with intelligence, diligence and wisdom in your study.\n\n\nMay you attain good results so that the name of our Lord may be\nglorified.\n\n\nLove-In-Christ,\n\n\nPaul Huang \n\n\n\n\nDear Daniel,\n\n\nA thousand apologies to you.\n\n\nI know I ought to be shot for taking such a long time to write.\n\n\nBut I guess better late than never.\n\n\nSo how are things with you?\n\n\nYou should be finishing your last lap and I am expecting to see you\nin early September.\n\n\nPlease don't disappoint us.\n\n\nThis letter therefore serves as a reminder to you that you ought to\nbe coming back to Singapore SOON.\n\n\nAs for me I have been terribly busy trying to juggle my time between\nwork and study.\n\n\nI am beginning to like what I am doing especially I get to meet new\npeople.\n\n\nI met up with Robert and Priscilla of Business Administration\nthrough Bun and managed to get them do a recording for me.\n\n\nI'll be meeting this PhD student from the Geography Department\ntogether with her cousin tomorrow.\n\n\nLooking forward to that.\n\n\nLife in Singapore is pretty much the same.\n\n\nI have already booked tickets to watch Les Miserables next March and\nthat cost me a bomb\n&dollar;124! \n\n\nWell I told myself if I want to watch it I might as well go\nfor the best seats, if not forget it.\n\n\nMet up with Bunny and Sun Leng a couple of weeks ago for lunch.\n\n\nBunny wasn't feeling too well last week as he was down with a flu.\n\n\nAs for Sun Leng she commenced work at the Institute of Molecular and\nCell Biology sometime middle of this month.\n\n\nShould be meeting Bunny and Sun Leng this week or next week for\nlunch.\n\n\nIncidentally, it seems that Dr Peter Wong is performing this\nWednesday on Campus Concert's Discovery Show.\n\n\nPerhaps Bunny and I should make plans to watch the performance and\nthen see how 'the man' actually fares.\n\n\nTakashimaya is opened and the shopping complex is just breathtaking.\n\n\nThings tend to be very expensive though.\n\n\nTherefore I have not bought anything from the store yet.\n\n\nEarly next month, Tangs Studio will be opening there.\n\n\nThere is a very exclusive gym within the complex and it costs a bomb\nto be a member.\n\n\nThe membership costs a thousand five hundred and monthly\nsubscription, one hundred dollars.\n\n\nWow!!\n\n\nBun has actually signed up for the trial membership which costs him\ntwo hundred for a month.\n\n\nI guess I would too if I am not working.\n\n\nHe is making full use of the facilities there.\n\n\nThe Presidential election takes place this Saturday therefore it is\na public holiday.\n\n\nFormer Deputy Prime Minister Mr Ong Teng Cheong is one of the two\ncandidates and I predict that he will actually win.\n\n\nWe'll see.\n\n\nWell, it seems that I have managed to fill you in about what's\nhappening in Singapore during your absence.\n\n\nDo take care and remember your friends in Singapore are all waiting\nfor your return.\n\n\nSayonara.\n\n\nPaul Huang \n\n\n\n\n24 August 1993\n\n\nDearest Edward,\n\n\nWas really surprised and thrilled to receive your letter especially\nI am not sure whether you have actually forgotten about me.\n\n\nWell, I am extremely busy especially now that I am working for NUS\nand on my Masters as well. \n\n\nTime really flies.\n\n\nBy the end of this year you'll graduate.\n\n\nGlad to know that you're coming to Singapore.\n\n\nWill certainly try to meet up with you despite my hectic schedule.\n\n\nAre you also here to look for a job?\n\n\nWill you have

{'text': 'Dear Krishnan,\n\n\nNews about Manoor has been disturbing.\n\n\nWhat does the swine hope to do?\n\n\nAnd about Bantu - - what happened to her handsome Canadian man?\n\n\nIs Mummy back?\n\n\nI called on three occasions but no onewas in.\n\n\nWhat the hell are you and Muslima up to?\n\n\nI am doing my third and final essay on Restitution - - a real tough\none.\n\n\nGot a " 2-1" and a " good 2-1" for the earlier 2 essays.\n\n\nDon\'t know if I can get a 2-1 for the exam.\n\n\nReally hope so.\n\n\nYou must have got your results by now.\n\n\nWhy the silence?\n\n\nDoes Kats or Kehar know that I am here It is about 1 am now.\n\n\nToo tired to think of anything else to write.\n\n\nGero\n\n\nP/S It gets dark at about 8.30 pm now.\n\n\nSpring is beautiful - - really love it - - especially the pretty\nflowers and trees they have here. \n\n\n\n\nLeeds,\n\n\nOct 4, 92\n\n\nMy Dear Vimala,\n\n\nLike basic Hi!\n\n\nHow are you, hot babe?\n\n\nMissing me lots I hope!\n\n\nWhat\'s happening in Singapore?\n\n\nIs it like sizzling?\n\n\nSeriously though, how are things with you?\n\n\nHow\'s work coming along?\n\n\nDid you decide once and for all on your options ( going by the cutest\nlecturers of course!).\n\n\nThings with me are OK.\n\n\nMy month in London was a good experience and I really enjoyed it but\nby the end I was quite glad it was over.\n\n\nIt\'s really tiring putting in a full day\'s work.\n\n\nIn fact, it\'s quite a lot harder than school/ university.\n\n\nMy hours were 9.30 am to 5.30 in the evening plus an hour either way\nfor commuting ( which I absolutely loathed past Day 3!) But the work itself\nwas an excellent experience which I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\n\nIt\'s interesting and high profile work.\n\n\nWell, let\'s see how things go, where I end up, what I end up doing!\n\n\nAny news of Ram?\n\n\nHave you seen, spoken to or heard of him?\n\n\nWhen exactly is his birthday?\n\n\n( a day after yours?)

Really Shiela, he\'s so very nice & he is\nvery understanding.\n\n\nI do miss him now,.\n\n\nBut there you go...\n\n\nthat\'s life!\n\n\nJust went out to dinner with this guy from Boston who\'s now\npart-timing at the youth Hostel!\n\n\nNice guy -- his name\'s Sam & he\'s cute!\n\n\nSmokes though!\n\n\nWell frankly, this has been the best summer of my life & I wished\nyou could have been there to share it.\n\n\ni miss you a lot - - meet lots of new people but it\'s never the\nsame.\n\n\nHow\'s Angel.\n\n\nI\'ve not heard from her in ages.\n\n\nPlease send her my sincerest regards.\n\n\nWell, shiela, got to go!\n\n\nPlease take care and write to me soon.\n\n\nMissing you,\n\n\nLetchmi \n\n\n\n\nHi Shiela,\n\n\nIt\'s nearly 1 am now & I just got off work.\n\n\nEveryone else has gone to a bar but I have to stay in.\n\n\nYou see my heart says " go" but my head says " no".\n\n\nI\'m not feeling well at all.\n\n\nI got a sore throat about a week ago & I thought I\'d recovered but\nobviously I\'m falling ill again.\n\n\nI\'ve got fever now, so I\'ve got to stay in and see the doctor\ntomorrow morning.\n\n\nWell enough of the boring stuff about my illness.\n\n\nHow are you?\n\n\nI do hope everything is going fine.\n\n\nWell, Lorraine seems to have got herself a real looker!\n\n\nWell, he\'s definitely not perfect.\n\n\nThe fact that he\'s going out with her is one major flaw!\n\n\nHee!\n\n\nHee!\n\n\nWhat about you?\n\n\nHow\'s the man front coming along?\n\n\nAs for me, I\'m really having a ball of a time.\n\n\nReally, I\'m flirting like nobody\'s business.\n\n\nYou know how I\'ve always been so cautious, well, now I don\'t give a\ndamn! \n\n\nBefore you let your jaw drop, don\'t get me wrong, I\'ve still not\nslept with anyone and I don\'t intend to, but I\'ve done lots of naughty\nthings...\n\n\nthis letter is strictly confidential so tear it up and throw it\naway...\n\n\nit\'s not meant to be a Harold Robbins novel!\n\n\nAt present I\'m seeing this guy who\'s English and also on the BUNNAC\nprogramme.\n\n\nI really do like him & it seems that he\'s head over heels about me\n` cos it\'s that situation where he wants to see me but I told him I\'m not\nsure.\n\n\nHe is 6 foot 4 & was a rugby player in his University.\n\n\nHe\'s graduated in Marketing and he\'s got a job in Australia where\nhe\'ll start later this year.\n\n\nHe\'s from Devon ( south of London).\n\n\nBy the way, his name\'s John...\n\n\nboring or what?\n\n\nBut he is Sooo SEXY!\n\n\nyou can just imagine, you know, rugby player, hard muscles and all!\n\n\nAnyway I\'ve decided to stay off him for awhile cos we\'re going a\nbit too fast.\n\n\nWell, Shiela, got to go.\n\n\ndo write soon cos woman, I really really miss you lots!\n\n\nHey, write back soon OK?\n\n\nLove, Hugs & Kisses,\n\n\nLetchmi', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1211ca12-d764-4645-a945-4b890086aad2', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.653780+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9821644425392151, 'non_english_score': 0.017835557460784912}
{'text': 'Wednesday\n\n\n28/10/92\n\n\nDearest Dylan,\n\n\nYour mum just got your letter yesterday and excitedly called me and\nPaul.\n\n\nOh boy!\n\n\nAre we ( your mum, Paul & I) glad that what I named as " The Hunt for\nDylan" can be aborted.\n\n\nWhat a relief!\n\n\nI\'ve actually called the Indian High Commission in S\'pore ( says can\'t\nhelp), the Govt.\n\n\nof India Tourist Office here ( not fully functioning and no one\nanswered my call) and the S\'pore High Com in Delhi ( called on Mon 26th\nunrealistically hoping Deepavali would not be celebrated for so long there,\notherwise there\'s no prospect of my calling & your mum doesn\'t feel confident\nin " weaving her way around/through" to get help).\n\n\nNow both Paul & I\'ve got to keep calling to inform those whom we\'ve\ncontacted in the unlikely hope that you might have dropped a note somewhere.\n\n\nPaul says he sure hopes you\'ll come back soon and in one piece....\n\n\nso that he can kick you in the ass!\n\n\nHow could you let your mum worry like that?\n\n\nHonestly if not for Paul\'s ominous dreams of you in trouble and my\nparanoia aroused by that travelogue, we would have thought it absolutely\nnatural for you who have always been fickle to change your plans a little or\neven a lot ( even over a cup of chai, I believe).\n\n\nAnyway the 3 of us were bonded by 2 to 3 calls on average per day to\none another.\n\n\nI was really getting jumpy and even quietly got myself prepared\npsychologically to go over there to search for you!!\n\n\nI guess I was really being overly imaginative & romantic.\n\n\nWhatever the case, I\'m really thankful you\'re alive and kicking even\nthough you\'re disgustingly incorrigible ( to have written but 1 " wise" line\nabout the mountains ( is that supposed to refer to yourself, wise guy?) after\nknowing the big hoohah you\'ve inadvertently created).\n\n\nEven though it\'s no longer material, just to satisfy our curiosity.\n\n\n( whether our speculations and part-findings were right).\n\n\n1) What was the US&dollar;65 for ( one way flight from Srinagar to Ladakh?).\n\n\n2) How did you get from Ladakh to Manali?\n\n\n( I didn\'t know of a direct route)\n\n\n3) Did you get the chance to experience the all notorious world\'s\nsecond highest motor road that\'s so prone to avalanches?\n\n\nHeard it takes 1 1/2 days by road from Srinagar to Ladakh?\n\n\n4) How was Ladakh or in fact India so far?\n\n\n5) Before going to Tamil Nadu to spend Christmas, where might you be\nbound?\n\n\nAfter Dharamsala, would there be another address to send you letters\nto?\n\n\nLooking in retrospect, the " hunt" sure added a lot of spice into\nlife but while at it, I\'d rather there\'s nothing as dramatic & nerve-wrecking\nlike it at all.\n\n\nIt\'s like reading a thriller where you\'re totally absorbed & gripped\nmore & more & when it\'s over it leaves you with cold sweat but otherwise a\nperfectly revived spirit.\n\n\nSince coming back, I\'ve often found myself in the " wrong" mood when\nsomeone comes along & genuinely or not so genuinely says " Tell me about\nIndia/ your experiences."\n\n\nI know one main reason I dread the question is I don\'t wish to dwell\non it as if it\'s still not over.\n\n\nBut just 2 days ago, on a dreamy off-day ( Deepavali) I found myself\nravished with delightful/awesome thoughts & memories of India, the heat, the\nstrange people I met, the special totally " natural" sewage system ( with\ncows eating banana skins & producing dung which is picked by little girls to\nbe slapped on mud walls, dried and used as fuel.) I was going on without end\nto Meng Kong & a secondary school classmate.\n\n\nThat girl used to be so meek and fearsome of her " omnipotent" mum\nbut now having met an Arab girl when bringing her students to a tennis court,\ndecided to backpack in Pakistan, Punjab & Goa for a month.\n\n\nI was so thrilled and was so encouraging that I thought I was\nbecoming you!\n\n\nI\'m so tempted myself...\n\n\nmust return before 30!\n\n\nYours,\n\n\nMary \n\n\n\n\nValentine\'s Day\n\n\nDearest Dylan,\n\n\nIt feels like ages since I last wrote to you.\n\n\nSorry I didn\'t write to your last destination, the ashram in Tamil\nNadu.\n\n\nOne day I was so thrilled at getting an aerogram from India, only to\nbe utterly disappointed it was actually my letter returned from Dharamsala.\n\n\nGuess I\'ll enclose it anyway though judging from your last letter\nit\'ll be totally irrelevant & meaningless, I don\'t recall what else I said\napart from the ominous feeling I had earlier over your disappearing act in\nLadakh and the immense relief when you reappeared.\n\n\nHeard from your mum that you\'re now helping some doctor in Calcutta.\n\n\nJust like you to be doing that but what\'s next, pal?\n\n\nI\'ve been pretty down though practice under an inspirational &\nconscientious old gentleman proves to be quite uplifting.\n\n\nI\'ve won some Chambers hearings & lost some, & my first open court\nwas adjourned, so I\'m still dying to do it.\n\n\nSome guy from a pretty well-established litigation-powered firm I\nknow socially from the Sub courts bar room actually tried to get me over,\neven though he hasn\'t seen me at trial & even though I warned him I\'m only\nhalf a year in practice - says I\'ve got the trustworthy look - - hmm, quite\nflattering I must say but I still prefer a more friendly, no politics\nsmall-time firm.\n\n\nExperience gained this way feels more, well, moral ( ? ) and guess\nthis will prove a much slower disillusioning process of law and justice.\n\n\nKnow what?\n\n\nThe profiteering ( more and more so under Yong Pung How) court\nprocess really irks me.\n\n\nSoon the courts will probably be called the Supreme Court of\nSingapore Pte. Ltd.!!\n\n\nWonder if Jocelyn has told you of her new boyfriend?\n\n\nI went out with her quite a few times - - their relationship seems\nstable but just a big practical hurdle for them to overcome - - trying to\nannul his marriage.\n\n\nWell, in present practice it\'s a virtual impossibility.\n\n\nSticky as it might be, she\'s sensible enough to want to concentrate\non her finals & keep that on hold - - though God knows how effective that\'ll\nbe.\n\n\nJust went windsurfing yesterday - - the masochistic joy of the bodily\naches just reminds me so vividly of our round-Maninjau biking trip.\n\n\nI miss you still - - miss the spontaneous moments we share.\n\n\nThough I thought I found a pal in Peter, he\'s just beyond grasp - -\nwe & Paul & Rajiv\'s brother Sanjay had another camp at Ubin on the second day\nof CNY but boy - - it poured and there was a gushing river right under one of\nthe tents.\n\n\nThankfully it stopped & we still had a good stuffing dinner with so\nmuch soup much was wasted the next morning after noodles breakfast.\n\n\nAfter breakfast the whole campsite was submerged.\n\n\nHave you found someone there - - that\'s the first reaction Pete had\nwhen I told him you wouldn\'t write for awhile.\n\n\nSorry I couldn\'t find the negatives of your " Spot the Differences"\nphoto & not having shared your 6 albums with anyone yet - - but I gather it\nmust have been an enthralling experience in Africa.\n\n\nWith respect to Govind I gather it won\'t work out - - there\'s just\nnot enough common ground to begin with but being physically together showed\nup the virtual impossibility of our ever being one, or as Kahlil Gibran puts\nit - - being 2 pillars supporting the roof of a temple.\n\n\nNow that I\'m back to this life...\n\n\nI wasn\'t sure but now having confided in a girlfriend, I\'m becoming\nmore sure - - it probably won\'t affect the course of my life - - apart from\noccasional blues and reminiscence - - as much as it would his.\n\n\nI don\'t know how to break it to him - - I had thought it was sensible\nfor him to come over to the testing ground - - but as my friend rightly put\nit - - it\'ll probably be much more devastating for him to find out here,\nhaving no cushions to fall back on.\n\n\nMy, I\'m so vexed!\n\n\nHe doesn\'t write for 2 months or 4(?) then sends a card to say he\'s\nsaving up for the trip & he\'s a third of the way through.\n\n\nDoesn\'t say much about his life apart from this.\n\n\nGosh!\n\n\nI\'m jumpy & still don\'t know what to do.\n\n\nI had set out a deadline since last December to reveal to him my\ndecision but it\'s already way beyond that - - really don\'t know if it\'s\npassion holding me back or pure procrastination.\n\n\nWith respect to my other crisis - - it\'s not over & it\'s getting\nworse but that I have to come to terms with - - it\'s probably going to be\nperpetual - - I know no matter what, I can live with it.\n\n\nAnyway I have to.\n\n\nGuess I\'ll tell you - - if you\'re all ears - - when you\'re back.\n\n\nSocially I\'ve been really active - - took up tennis beginners\'\ncourse.\n\n\nThat\'s ended but our group of 7 is still quite cohesive.\n\n\nWe went out for a real good movie " Accidental Hero" starring Dustin\nHoffman, Geena Davis & Andy Garcia & had another session which turned out to\nbe much longer than planned - - guess there\'ll be more sessions to come.\n\n\nI\'ve been quite a spender - - on clothes & books - - I\'m now at\nRobert Pirsig\'s second book, " Lila: An Inquiry into Morals".\n\n\nThough not as gripping as " Zen", it still spins a good web - -\nreally unusual.\n\n\nThere\'s also this Indian men period - - dunno if I\'ve bragged about\nit already - - when 4 or so were unusually interested in me.\n\n\nNo doubt they\'re fun to talk to - - being such naturals at the art of\nthe tongue but always feel they\'re dangerous to meddle with.\n\n\nAnd this most recent guy with whom there\'s mutual interest - - but it\nturns out he only talks passionately about work & is married - - am I glad I\ngot a girlfriend along to our drinking session.\n\n\nThen there\'s the over-cautious guy who at one time called me everyday\n& some days more than once who would come up with surprise invitations or a\ndrink but sends a Valentine card signing off " Just friends".\n\n\nWonder what there is to qualify?\n\n\nGuess I\'ll take up dancing, probably jazz, again.\n\n\nGonna get the adrenaline pumping.\n\n\nJust hope it won\'t be long before I know where to send this letter\nto.\n\n\nHAPPY VALENTINE\'S!\n\n\n( Backdate it OK?)\n\n\nLove & Hugs,\n\n\nMary \n\n\n\n\nMon\n\n\n8/3/93\n\n\n2.30 am\n\n\nDear Dylan\n\n\nWell, after receiving your letter on 19th Feb 93 after a wild nite\nout, I have been thinking hard where to send my letter to you & also trying\nhard to get Peter but he\'s always having his nap or out or not back yet or at\ncamp.\n\n\nCan you fathom a more unreachable friend?\n\n\nLian Huay has been missing from my life for a long, long time too.\n\n\nIn fact I\'m feeling really depressed lately - - I\'ve been\noverspending shortly before & after I wrote a letter to Govind on Valentine\'s\nDay after writing yours, & making myself more blue by trying to alleviate my\nmoodiness hanging around " fun" people & places but just ended up feeling\nmeaningless!\n\n\nRecently - - just 2 nights ago at a Teo clan dinner - - I got to\nknow this chief editor of a Chinese paper whom I\'ve always admired & realised\nthat the decision to end the relationship with Govind is the right choice.\n\n\nNot that I\'ve fallen for that man ( I\'m not interested in married\nmen), but I\'ve realised it\'ll need to be someone of that kind of intellect,\nwide-ranging interests & thought.\n\n\nI just can\'t help noticing the stark lack of depth in what I can\nshare with Govind - - no doubt he\'s kind but like you and Lian Huay knew from\nthe outset - - we just lack that common ground for it to work out. \n\n\nMaybe it was only me that couldn\'t see them.\n\n\nI don\'t think it\'s good enough if I can share much more with you,\nLian Huay etc. than with him.\n\n\nWell, that aside, just to clarify some matters, I certainly never\nknew about the Modern Lodge address - - could that letter be held up in the 1\nmonth strike you mentioned to your mum as well?\n\n\nWell if you do receive this letter & if everything else - - time,\nmoney, mood - - permits, do give me a ring OK?\n\n\nHaven\'t heard your voice for such a long time.\n\n\nHow\'s your visit to Benares?\n\n\nI certainly enjoyed that very-rich-with-culture-&-myth place\ntremendously & that inspirational singing by a devout Hindu taking his daily\nbath in the Ganges at dawn & too many other things.\n\n\nDid you stay at your old lodge - - Trimurti - - again?\n\n\nWell, about your name Aniccananda - - I just wonder how\nImpermanence can be bliss?\n\n\nI\'ve just been lamenting to Peter in a letter ( as I\'ve given up\nlooking for him & decided to send your letter to him) that I seem to have\nlost passion for life & that joys & pain are so transient but meaningless\nprevails.\n\n\nPerhaps in your present state you could enlighten me?\n\n\nWhy do I not feel the lingering joy & satissfaction that I used to\nafter cycling, windsurfing or even after some hard work but only while at it?\n\n\nI\'m getting purely existential now & I hate it!\n\n\nGuru pray tell me how to be revitalised?\n\n\nIf it\'s all in the mind then how to even begin?\n\n\nMy tennis class is over & I\'ve just begun on French again - - even\nthen I\'m not really any happier.\n\n\nWell but whatever it is, I have faith I\'ll come round.\n\n\nAnyway I\'m now at Richard Bach\'s " Bridge Across Forever".\n\n\nIt sure gives great consolation.\n\n\nMary', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'fe62c95a-c2ad-4c5d-938b-b212fef8b3c3', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.655043+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9752650260925293, 'non_english_score': 0.024734973907470703}
{'text': '23 Mar 93\n\n\nDear Dylan,\n\n\nHave not heard from you almost for ages, aeons, centuries - - seems\nlike ETERNITY actually.\n\n\nAnyway, as is the case, there are so many things to say and tell and\nparadoxically ( sometimes; maybe all the time for you) there is nothing to\nsay.\n\n\nNonetheless I think we somehow lost connection along the way ( due, I\nthink, to both the workload for the year that has just ended and your\nnon-sedentary, shifting, ever-restless movement over God-knows-where).\n\n\nSo, to begin with, the reason for this note/letter/memo is because\nPaul came over to the hostel at Eusoff College and told me you called and\nwould be leaving the ashram where you are now by the end of March and that I\nhad better write you something before you\'re again " SOMEWHERE OUT THERE" and\nwhere nobody can reach you by mail/air/phone or whatever the latest\ntechnology has invented.\n\n\nYes!, the exams just ended on the 20th March 93 and thanks to the "\nPOWERS THAT BE", it has been a rough ( to say the least) year.\n\n\n" Things got bad and things got worse" ( to borrow the line from CCR)\nbut the important ( oh really?) thing is that I survived and got through ( at\nleast completed) the most absurd/crazy/face-contorting thing they call EXAMS.\n\n\nI really am not expecting much from the exams or the quality of the\nresults because of the many knocks/distractions along the way and of course,\nmy still so-reluctant-to-accept-the-system kind of attitude.\n\n\nNonetheless, I have to say that I endured and did at times ( really!)\ntranscend the madness - - even though these were few and far between.\n\n\nHave been staying at Eusoff College for about 15 months now ( great,\nwonderful, splendid place - - no doubt) and sadly will be leaving to go back\nto Yishun by the 31st March, which means I\'ll have about a week to sort\nthings out and get started on life at home again.\n\n\nGood thing is, I\'ll be going to either Thailand or Indonesia for\nabout 6 weeks from 10 April and shall try to recover from what I call A YEAR\nOF MADNESS.\n\n\nWill spend some time living it up and recovering from the loss before\nthe term in IE begins in July.\n\n\nPaul will be staying in Eusoff College for a month or two ( yes, he\nwill be taking over my room!) and trying to complete his thesis - - something\nI think he shouldn\'t have much problem with.\n\n\nHe has been visiting me quite regularly for runs and dinners ( if not\nat the Adam Road Food Centre than its somewhere in town).\n\n\nWe talk about you often in these session and wonder what in the world\nyou are doing out there sometimes.\n\n\nAnd yes, when it\'s a full moon the karmic particles that form an\ninvisible bridge does help us to remember you better ( whatever this may mean\nto you - - but it really does, OK?).\n\n\nSo to sign off, I think if you should ever receive this letter, you\nshould write me sometime ( whenever you feel up to it) and you should address\nit to:\n\n\nBlock 123, Yishun Ave 99,\n\n\nICE-SIN:#32-987, S(2776)\n\n\nThis is the address I\'ll be staying ( actually it\'s my sister\'s\nplace) for sometime - - I think for a very long time in fact.\n\n\nSo, before I go, there are actually many, many, many other things\nthat have taken place/ changed my life ( positively or negatively I can never\ntell) that I had thought I wanted to write down but am unable.\n\n\nNonetheless to cut the long ( and sometimes sad) story short, Nothing\nHas Happened - - it depends on the perceiver as well as the perceived, as I\nthink you would agree.\n\n\nBut here\'s a word that may hint at my present state of mind: " THERE\nIS DIGNITY IN WORK ONLY IF IT IS FREELY CHOSEN" - - Camus.\n\n\nSo is Sisyphus on to new heights?\n\n\nWill see you soon then, hopefully.\n\n\nTake care, take it easy ( as we always say) and am hoping to hear\nfrom you.\n\n\nBon Voyage\n\n\nMatthew \n\n\n\n\nDear Guru,\n\n\nI thought the Enlightened One had forgotten his brothers in Samsara.\n\n\nWe\'re wondering if you\'ve taken on a vow of silence and become a monk\nsomewhere.\n\n\nBut then we remembered your horny ways and came to the conclusion\nthat you must\'ve found ecstasy and oblivion in some more earthly quarters.\n\n\nThe last word we got from you was a crumpled postcard from Ladakh\nthat didn\'t say very much.\n\n\nYour mum was so worried at one stage.\n\n\nSo was Mary and myself.\n\n\nIt was good that we waited a little longer before doing something\ndrastic.\n\n\nI thought and tried to tell your mum that you probably needed some\nquiet time.\n\n\nSo, are you home again?\n\n\nHave you found a maid?\n\n\nI had a strange dream some time ago.\n\n\nI saw you with a Nepali wife and a trail of kids back here, walking\nthe streets, looking for a place.\n\n\nIt was snowing in Singapore and the scene was quite different from\nthe hell we know.\n\n\nYou looked quite a family man, buying hot steaming noodles for your\nkids.\n\n\nCan\'t remember how it ended.\n\n\nYour mum must have told you about Thomas.\n\n\nIt was a good thing they found him early.\n\n\nHe\'s recovered but seems quite ready to go any moment.\n\n\nI mean he spoke of little else except " letting Nature run its\ncourse".\n\n\nThe important thing is he is at peace.\n\n\nStrange, it happened about the same time as Bede\'s stroke.\n\n\nMatthew has just finished his exams and will be leaving for a short\ntrip, either Thailand or Indonesia.\n\n\nHe\'s had one or two romantic disappointments during the last year\nwhich he is quite used to by now.\n\n\nIt\'s going to be a lonely old town when he\'s gone.\n\n\nIt\'s almost a year now since your departure.\n\n\nI hope you\'ve done some thinking along the way and come to a decision\nas to which road to take.\n\n\nWe aren\'t getting no younger.\n\n\nI\'m sure whatever path you choose it will be the right one.\n\n\nWe have to make things work.\n\n\nForgive me if I sound incoherent.\n\n\nYour mum just called to say that you would be leaving the ashram soon\nand with a raging fever I write so that I might catch you.\n\n\nI\'ve not been feeling well for a while.\n\n\nThe body is falling apart and the soul is quite undernourished.\n\n\nI\'ll be finishing in a few months\' time.\n\n\nAnd after that, I know not what awaits me.\n\n\nAnyway, I\'m quite resigned by now to the rotten state the world is in\nand quite prepared for things to get worse.\n\n\nDo send some good news if you can.\n\n\nAbout the wife and the kids.\n\n\nHope you find the strength to leave India sometime.\n\n\nOtherwise, you might not be able to get out, for we know that India\nis a more dangerous addiction than either a Welsh Rose or the snow leopard.\n\n\nI guess I\'ll stop here.\n\n\nThis fever is making my head spin.\n\n\nDo take care and write about the journey.\n\n\nYours,\n\n\nPaul\n\n\nP/S Your last letter did not get through.\n\n\nPerhaps you got the address wrong.\n\n\nSo here it is: Blk 747,\n#00-9000 Ave 4, Punggol Point, S\'pore 4676. \n\n\n\n\nSat 27/3/93\n\n\nDear Dylan,\n\n\nI\'m sure glad you finally wrote again.\n\n\nHope this time the letter will reach you.\n\n\nGuess your mum told you that I wrote you in Kathmandu but I had\noverestimated the length of your stay at Benares & so posted my letter too\nlate.\n\n\nIn fact that letter encloses an aerogram that was returned to sender\nfrom Dharamsala.\n\n\nI\'ve only just received your postcard which was written on 11th March\nonly yesterday.\n\n\nSo guess it\'s more likely I\'ll get another returned mail.\n\n\nBut anyway no harm trying.\n\n\nMy life\'s still the pits, though at least I\'ve been able to abstain\nfrom smoking for a little over a month.\n\n\nI was rather hooked at one point to the extent of needing 1 or 2 fags\neveryday.\n\n\nIt\'s not so much the health factor I had in mind but the\nuncomfortable truth that it is an addiction that I may not be able to shake\noff in future.\n\n\nAnd anyway, I\'ve also come to terms with the fact that the reason for\nmy depression will be here to stay & if I were to need that thing so badly\nI\'m just ruining my life & losing control.\n\n\nBy the way, what a coincidence that I also chose to write to you on\nValentine\'s Day.\n\n\nIt\'s probably depressing you had to spend yours in such an "\nunglamorous" fashion.\n\n\nBut a few years/ many years down the road you\'ll probably look back &\nremember it as such an unforgettable experience.\n\n\nMine was totally bland.\n\n\nJocelyn\'s exams should be over by now.\n\n\nWe\'ve been meeting up quite a few times even up till less than a\nmonth before her papers.\n\n\nGuess I can look her up again.\n\n\nNowadays with Lian Huay totally engulfed in her job prospecting for\nforeign exchange market clients I seem to have lost that everyday\ncompanionship in watching movies.\n\n\nPeter\'s always taking naps or out & sometimes I call to find out\nhe\'s out at camp & never asked me along.\n\n\nI wonder if his suspicion of you having a woman when you declared\nyou won\'t write for awhile applies to him as well.\n\n\nWell, of course life\'s not totally dreary.\n\n\nAt least there\'re little perks in life such as my tennis is\nimproving - - well not so tremendously but at least enough to allow me and\nanother girl to beat 2 guys, one of whom is really powerful & plays\nstrategically 3-0, though eventually we still lost the game 4-6.\n\n\nHey, gotta get off.\n\n\nI\'ll just pen off here!\n\n\nHope you have another wonderful 6 months immersing in the Indian\nair.\n\n\nHey, do write longer letters so I can know what\'s up in your mind -\n- logic - - rather than being an unfathomable pilgrim - - moving on & on - -\nlike the rolling stone you fear most to be.\n\n\nTake care!\n\n\nLove,\n\n\nMary \n\n\n\n\nShantivanam,\n\n\n3/4/93\n\n\nDear Mary,\n\n\nGood to hear from you finally.\n\n\nThe last letter I got from you was in Dharamsala last Oct!\n\n\nYou sound pretty low.\n\n\nWhen you mentioned that " the reason for my depression will be here\nto stay", I\'m wondering if you\'re feeling down on life in general, or your\njob, or something more specific.\n\n\nSounds like you need a holiday - - a long one.\n\n\nDo you really like your job?\n\n\nDo you really like your life?\n\n\nIs that what you really want to do?\n\n\nOr are you feeling stuck?\n\n\nThe letters I got from you and especially from Paul and Matthew all\nseem to convey an utter sense of despair and hopelessness, a sense of\nstuckness with no way out.\n\n\nAnd you guys are wondering why I\'m staying in India so long!!\n\n\nI\'m happy here in India.\n\n\nI\'ve been basically on the spiritual path - - doing meditation\nretreats, staying at ashrams and Buddhist centres.\n\n\nIt\'s been a beautiful journey of learning and communion with kindred\nsouls.\n\n\nA profound lesson I\'ve learnt is that one\'s happiness ultimately\ndoes not depend on externals.\n\n\nBut having said that, I would be very cautious about preaching this\nmessage to you guys drowning in your own dukkha because I\'m well aware of how\nhard it would be to practice it myself once I\'m back in S\'pore.\n\n\nI\'m leaving the ashram today and slowly heading back up north to\nDharamsala and that general area to sit out the hot season for 2-3 months.\n\n\nI\'m stopping off at Goa for maybe 2 weeks on the way up.\n\n\nIt\'s funny but in all these 7 months in India I haven\'t really spent\nmuch time relaxing on a beach, despite being the beachbum that I am.\n\n\nI did have a few days to kill in Goa in Nov just before heading off\nfor a Vipassana retreat, and in early Jan I was in Kerala but I was having\nquite a stressful time in my relationship with the girl I was with ( we split\nup in Kerala), so I\'m now very much looking forward to hanging out on a beach\nfor awhile, listening to the breathing of the ocean and letting everything\ndissolve into the Great Mother. \n\n\nI can say with 99% certainty that I should be back in S\'pore by the\nend of the year at the very latest.\n\n\nIf you think you can get some time off in Dec maybe we could do a\nsmall trip somewhere, and Peter too, it would be his school holidays.\n\n\nWhat is that pathetic guy doing, I haven\'t heard from him at all.\n\n\nDon\'t feel offended if he doesn\'t ask you along on his weekend\ncamps, I think he needs time to himself.\n\n\nPersonally, I doubt if he\'s " having a woman", as you suspect.\n\n\nI wonder if time seems to be going really quickly for you or\nwhether it\'s dragging its heels.\n\n\nFor me it\'s really flying - - even though I have a new visa that\nwill see me through till Sept, it seems to me more like 6 weeks than 6\nmonths.\n\n\nI congratulate you on your efforts to stop smoking.\n\n\nKeep it up, you really don\'t need it.\n\n\nAnd I appreciate your efforts at trying to get in touch with me at\nKathmandu.\n\n\nThe letters that I send to you to share with the rest of the gang I\nhope you\'ve done that ( Paul\'s phone no.\n\n\nis 1234567 in case you think it\'s easier to contact him directly\nrather than go through Peter).\n\n\nIf you\'re still feeling depressed my temporary advice to you is to\nmeditate, and if you find that inapplicable for some reason then my advice is\nto hang out at ABC - - I think it\'s a good centre, you might meet some\ninteresting people there.\n\n\nFor Peter I have no advice.\n\n\nMaybe a cold shower might help.\n\n\nHope to hear from you soon.\n\n\nI wish you peace and joy.\n\n\nLove,\n\n\nDylan',

{'text': 'Dharamsala,\n\n\n21/2/94\n\n\nDearest Mary,\n\n\nHow\'s it going?\n\n\nHope this finds you and Helmut well and happy and nice and warm.\n\n\nWarm?\n\n\nYes, I\'m sitting by my window right now, witnessing a spectacular\nsnowstorm outside.\n\n\nIt\'s nice and warm in my room - - well, what\'s warm and what\'s cold?\n\n\nIt\'s all relative.\n\n\nIt must be about 10* C now in my lovely heaterless room, which is\nnice and warm compared to outside.\n\n\nI can\'t guess what the temperature is outside.\n\n\nYes, it\'s wonderful to be back in Dharamsala, back where I really\nfeel most at home.\n\n\nIt\'s exactly 2 weeks now since I got back here, re-connecting with\nold friends from my l-o-ng India road, and making new friends too.\n\n\nMy first week here the weather was cold and it snowed a bit on about\n4 or 5 days, though nothing like today\'s incredible snowstorm.\n\n\nThen the last one week the weather really turned warm and sunny &\nvery pleasant and people were saying it was the end of winter, that it would\nbe warming up from now on - ha, ha!\n\n\nYesterday there was a sudden change in the weather and last night was\nso-o-o-o cold!\n\n\nThis morning I was supposed to go up the hill to Tushita for a\nspecial teaching by a high lama at 9:30 but the weather was so bad and it was\nso cold I couldn\'t even bear to crawl out of my sleeping bag and blankets.\n\n\nIt\'s 12 noon now and I\'ve just finished breakfast in bed.\n\n\nIf this weather keeps up looks like I\'ll be marooned here in the\nmonastery for the rest of the day.\n\n\nGreat, just when I\'ve run out of food too!\n\n\nActually this sudden change in the weather could be attributed to\nnone other than the Dalai Lama himself.\n\n\nPeople say that whenever His Holiness gives a high-powered tantric\ninitiation the weather changes from warm to cold or vice versa.\n\n\nWell, yesterday morning there was a big initiation which I attended\nand then a couple of hours after it ended, huge dark clouds and a truly\nhorrific wind appeared out of nowhere.\n\n\nI remember towards the end of the ceremony H.H.\n\n\nsaid, " May the blessings of all the Boddhisattvas rain down upon you\nlike showers of falling snow." No kidding!\n\n\nI didn\'t think he meant that literally!\n\n\nI really hope this snow stops soon ( this is really getting serious\nnow!) I\'ve got a few friends up at Tushita who are supposed to come back down\ntoday, one of whom is this girl that, out of my boundless compassion, I lent\nmy very warm winter sleeping bag to, and she lent me her summer bag in\nexchange ( since it\'s colder up there than here at the Nyingma Monastery).\n\n\nWhat selflessness!\n\n\nAlso tomorrow I\'ve got a specially arranged one-on-one with a\nhigh-powered Geshe who people say is enlightened or almost enlightened.\n\n\nThe appointment is at the Centre for Tibetan Studies which is\nnormally half an hour\'s walk away.\n\n\nIt\'s an appointment I intend to keep even if I have to tunnel my way\nthrough the snow.\n\n\nMaybe this is a test of my courage and determination!\n\n\nWell anyway I hope you\'re doing alright and behaving yourself ( I\ngave up smoking on Losar 10 days ago - - a good idea with all these hills I\nhave to climb).\n\n\nSay hi to Peter, Matthew, Peck Hoon, etc.\n\n\netc.\n\n\nTake care.\n\n\nHope to hear from you sometime ( if I\'m not buried under 6 feet of\nsnow!)\n\n\nLove,\n\n\nDylan \n\n\n\n\n3/3/94\n\n\nDearest Dylan,\n\n\nYes, your letter certainly found me and Helmut very well, happy and\nwarm ( mm...!) ( even without the stark contrast with you).\n\n\nWell, but what prompted me to write immediately after receiving your\nletter is not to gloat but that I realised I\'m not going to be in time to\nwish you a very fulfilling 30th birthday - - esp.\n\n\nin your spiritual path or whatever priority you may now have.\n\n\nWell, quite a bit seems to have happened even though you haven\'t been\ngone all that long.\n\n\nFirst of all, Helmut and I progressed tremendously.\n\n\nWell, the awakening process sure ain\'t a sudden leap.\n\n\nThere\'s always so mush to learn about oneself and about each other -\n- endless possibilities to explore really.\n\n\nMm, I\'ve sent Isabella a postcard to let her know that she can always\nreach me even when you\'re not around.\n\n\nMeanwhile, just 2 days after you left Singapore ( which was the same\nday Peck Hoon took off to Bangkok), my dad had a heart attack.\n\n\nIt was an unprecedented attack and neither my mum nor I recognised\nthe symptoms - - my dad having breathing difficulties and in excruciating\npain, contorted facial muscles, etc.\n\n\nWell maybe it\'s good that he\'s a man with such a high threshold for\npain normally, so that when he behaves so abnormally, we take notice.\n\n\nThankfully, he was sent to the Singapore General Hospital early\nenough and the Coronary Care Unit is really surprisingly advanced and\nefficient.\n\n\nAfter the initial rather difficult spur of the moment decision about\nletting him take a very powerful new drug called the Streptocanis ( ? ) , he\nrecovered miraculously fast and was discharged on the eve of Chinese New Year\nand was only back for an angiogram. \n\n\n\n\n17/3/94\n\n\nWell, I paid your mum a visit on the last days of Chinese New Year\nand helped myself to your " 1984" - - I\'ve always thought I had read it but\nrealised I hadn\'t.\n\n\nNow it\'s finished and I must say that it is truly an amazingly\npowerful book - - so gripping and terrifying - - especially after the twist\nin the story of the old shopkeeper turning out to be a Thought Police and the\nendless grilling.\n\n\nGod!\n\n\nwhen the story started it was bleak enough, yet there was that hope\nor at least a glimmer of hope - - but then it turned out to be just so\ndevastating.\n\n\nI\'m so disturbed - immersing myself in the book is just such an\nexperience!\n\n\nSorry I assumed you wouldn\'t mind my improper mode of " borrowing"\nyour book - - I\'m still sure you don\'t.\n\n\nThanks for the good book - it\'ll be returned to you either upon your\nreturn or request, along with " Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance".\n\n\nIt was quite a funny situation, while I was at your mum\'s place I\npaged Helmut, who was meeting his mum ( I\'ve met her once - - she\'s the kind\nthat easily takes to niceties and falsities and can\'t take the reality as\nperceived by Helmut but lives in an illusory world), but as his mum was tired\nand needed to retire to her place, which is an illegal residential church, he\nwas free to meet me at your mum\'s place.\n\n\nHowever when he turned up, your cousin, a Kelvin and his girlfriend\nhad arrived too and I was introduced as your friend - - I just thought it was\na rather funny situation.\n\n\nTold your mum about my dad\'s situation and found that not Too long\nago, an uncle of yours died from his 2nd attack which was very shortly after\nthe first.\n\n\nIt\'s really no joke.\n\n\nThough my dad doesn\'t seem at all affected by that critical condition\nwhich was only such a short while ago, it\'s worrying that he will go back to\nhis heavy smoking days as per normal, thus creating the conditions for the\n2nd attack to erupt.\n\n\nSo far, I\'ve been occasionally a nag to ask him to cut down on his 40\nsticks a day to about 10 but not with very great success.\n\n\nI never realised/ really understood why I wasn\'t keen on joining Peck\nHoon to Thailand especially when I\'m forever so hard-up about trips.\n\n\nWell, I would say now it\'s really karmic - - the link between my dad\nand me, his only kid who can talk back at him but still loves him\naffectionately despite his ultra strict and conservative personality.\n\n\nWell, naturally, the trip with Pete to Mount Ophir was cancelled.\n\n\nMeanwhile, just thought each trip always seems to bring about change\nand usually very constructive ones.\n\n\nRight after the trip to Malaysia with my parents, I started seeing\nHelmut and right after my solo trip to Trikora Beach things really started\ngoing between us - - it made me sure of how I felt for him.\n\n\nWell, come end of March, I\'m going up to Awana Chalet ( halfway up\nGenting) with tennis friends ( including Stan) and come end of April, that\'s\nthe real treat - - Trikora with Helmut for a long weekend.\n\n\nMm, can\'t wait.\n\n\nLove,\n\n\nMary \n\n\n\n\nDear Dylan,\n\n\nSorry that this card will arrive late and the somewhat " naughty"\nreminder of time passing.\n\n\nAnyway, have been extra, hyper busy with work \'cos projects for IE (\ntwo of them) due around this crazy season.\n\n\nHave to complete them by 12 March and IE exams happen on 15 March.\n\n\nMad, is it not?\n\n\nWill know my posting to a more " permanent" school later this month.\n\n\nSo here\'s to another year of whatever you think/ conceive of/imagine\nto be best/ most suitable for yourself and in whichever ashram, guesthouse,\nhotel, motel that you may find yourself, have a great time!!\n\n\n*Notice the picture shows only a half-moon.\n\n\nMatthew\n\n\nMarch 94\n\n\nP/S Please write me sometime!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20 Apr 94\n\n\nDear Dylan,\n\n\nYou are probably surprised that I\'ve finally lifted up my pen.\n\n\nI\'m surprised too.\n\n\nI just hope I have enough things to write about.\n\n\nAfter all, my life ( if it can be called one) in boring old Singapore\nscarcely seems worth the effort of pushing a pen to describe.\n\n\nEspecially compared to yours.\n\n\nWhat with the near celebrity status, the synthesis of spiritual and\nfleshly bliss, surely the mark of a high level of enlightenment, and romance\nagainst the backdrop of legendary natural beauty.\n\n\nAs I said to Paul last night, SBC ought to buy your story.\n\n\nIf they have the budget to make use of it.\n\n\nMe, well, I\'m back at home, locked up in my little bedroom like a\nvoluntary prisoner, a victim of the merciless onslaught of the mass media,\ndrowning in the radio waves of stupefying inanity.\n\n\nNo, of course I\'m not depressed.\n\n\nIf you think I sound so, you should have seen me as I was several\ndays ago.\n\n\nOr last week, that night when I drank myself to sleep.\n\n\nI had been living at the ISS for several weeks, busy first with a\nproject, and then with the last exams which finished a week and half ago.\n\n\nAfter that was internship, so I came home.\n\n\nI started work in what I call " soulless Shenton Way", where\nsometimes the veneer of smartness and material affluence through which, to\nme, spiritual hollowness so plainly shows, sinks me into despair.\n\n\nI bury my head in my analysis work.\n\n\nI read a quote from 2001, by HAL: " I\'m using my capacity to the\nfullest, what more could a rational being want?" Not very convincing, is it?\n\n\nAt home I had no work to distract me, and no money to go out.\n\n\nBut I had a bottle of whiskey.\n\n\nNow even that is nearly gone.\n\n\n( Come to think of it, that was from you wasn\'t it?) But I\'m\nrecovering a little now.\n\n\nEven picked up enough energy to keep calling a female classmate up.\n\n\nAnd no, this time it\'s not married woman.\n\n\nAh, women indeed!\n\n\nPerhaps I could do with a little advice too, O benign sage.\n\n\nI hardly know what I am doing, except I know I crave female\ncompanionship.\n\n\nThis woman, you\'d probably think she\'s not my type.\n\n\nBut we get along OK.\n\n\nShe has the fascination in my eyes as an incomprehensible alien\nspecies.\n\n\nNot really materialistic, she lives entirely in the material world.\n\n\nShe embraces the common as perhaps a saint would embrace humanity.\n\n\nShe sometimes makes me feel a pedantic snob.\n\n\nShe has a lightness of spirit that carries her skipping all day\nthrough the very hells that oppress my soul.\n\n\nI mean the shopping centres. \n\n\nHer slim body can ingest unbelievable amounts food, which she bids\nme eat, though a fraction of what she takes is enough to make me grow even\nfatter.\n\n\nStrange creature, huh, guru?\n\n\nWhat do you think, O Master, is this an angel or a demon?\n\n\nBenightedly yours,\n\n\nPeter\n\n\nP/S Whatever you do - - DON\'T COME BACK; YOU\'LL REGRET IT!', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '92460a03-cca0-4516-99d2-f56b5ec1b139', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.657586+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9805083870887756, 'non_english_score': 0.019491612911224365}
{'text': '18th October 1994\n\n\nDearest Regina,\n\n\n Examinations \n\n\nI have just finished my business computing ( 74.100) exam and my\ncommercial law ( 02.100) exam.\n\n\nIt has been tough but I feel that I have done pretty okay for those 2\npapers.\n\n\nI will not get distinctions but will probably get Bs.\n\n\nMy next paper is on Thursday and it is Micro Economics ( 13.100).\n\n\nI am frightened half to death!\n\n\nIts one of my worst subjects, the other being Macro Economics.\n\n\nI am just praying for a pass for these 2 papers.\n\n\nI will be busy studying so my next letter to you would probably be\nafter the whole exam.\n\n\nBut do keep your letter coming please!!\n\n\n Meetings \n\n\nI have not been to the meetings two weeks prior to exams and have not\ngone during exam period.\n\n\nI eat, sleep and dream facts I have to remember.\n\n\nIf I go to the meeting, I probably end up reciting the facts to\nmyself and not pay attention.\n\n\nAnyway, I didn\'t want to trouble Stuart to take me to the meetings as\nhe is studying too.\n\n\nSo I end up not going.\n\n\nI will go regularly once the horrifying exams finish and I still\nretain my sanity.\n\n\nThe stress is pretty high as everyone seems to be studying and\nstudying all the time.\n\n\nI feel the strain.\n\n\nBut don\'t worry, I am fine.\n\n\n Job \n\n\nMy job has 2 training sessions and I just went for one of them.\n\n\nThe theoretical session was interesting and I had a lot of questions,\nmore so than the others as I am a foreigner.\n\n\nThe 2 managers talked about the purposes of Student Job Search and\nhow they are there to protect students\' interest and find them jobs worthy of\ndoing.\n\n\nThe lowest wage rate is\n&dollar;6.12 gross an hour of\n&dollar;5.22 nett an hour.\n\n\nAny lower and we are not to accept the jobs offered by employers.\n\n\nWe were also to watch out for discrimination against women, the\nMaoris, ethnic groups ( like myself!) and any other forms of discriminations.\n\n\nIncidentally, I am the only Chinese and the only overseas student\nemployed to work at Student Job Search as an employment officer.\n\n\nIt is a coveted job, I heard from various students!\n\n\nIt seems I am the cat who got the cream!!!\n\n\nI also found out that most of the employment contractual period is up\nto 31st 1994 or 31st Jan 1995.\n\n\nI have my employment period to 10th Feb.\n\n\n1995.\n\n\nNot bad, eh?\n\n\nThe people I am going to work with seems to be friendly and very nice\npeople.\n\n\nThe managers are very helpful too.\n\n\nSo I can see that I am going to enjoy working here ( I hope!).\n\n\nStuart is still having his bible study with Brother Fook regularly,\neven during exam period.\n\n\nHe didn\'t even think of stopping during this time.\n\n\nQuite impressed, I was indeed.\n\n\nHe may get a part-time job after the exams but even if he doesn\'t, he\ngets unemployment benefits,\n&dollar;134.69 a week.\n\n\n( I know the figures because I as an employment officer, am supposed\nto advise these university students as to how much they are getting and where\nto apply for these benefits.)\n\n\nSo he will be surviving all right!\n\n\n Movies \n\n\nI went to see two movies, one called " Threesome\' and the other one\nis Heavenly Creatures.\n\n\nBoth are pretty arty-farty, if you know what I mean.\n\n\nThreesome is about 2 guys and 1 girl who shared a dorm flat together\nby accident.\n\n\nOne of the guys like the girl, and the girl likes the other guy and\nthe other guy likes his male room mate.\n\n\nThus a real love triangle is formed.\n\n\nIt\'s about the three of them discovering who they really are.\n\n\nA pretty well-filmed picture.\n\n\nThere were two scenes where there was an orgy - the three of them\nhaving sex together.\n\n\nIt would have been sordid if not for the artistic filming and\nediting.\n\n\nThe other movie is a movie based on a real life murder that happened\nin 1956 in New Zealand, Christchurch.\n\n\nTwo teenage girls conspired to kill one of the girl\'s mother.\n\n\nThey were only 15 years old.\n\n\nThey formed a close friendship and lived half in the real world and\nhalf in fantasy.\n\n\nThere was a hot scene where they realised they loved one another (\nlesbianism creeping in).\n\n\nThen one of the girls had to go away to South Africa and the other\ngirl\'s mother did not allowed her to go with her.\n\n\n( Of course not!\n\n\nNo sane mother would!) Anyway, they then conspired to kill her, as\nthey see her as an obstacle to their being together.\n\n\nBoth were arrested and convicted of first degree murder as the murder\nwas well planned in one of the girl\'s diary.\n\n\nWith mensrea ( intention to kill) proven, it was murder.\n\n\nBoth were too young for death penalty, so were incarcerated in\ndifferent prisons.\n\n\nOne was released in 1959 ( 3 years later) and joined her mother\noverseas.\n\n\nThe other was released in 1965.\n\n\nBoth were released on the condition they must never meet each other\nagain.\n\n\nIt was a very good movie.\n\n\nI liked it more than threesome as it had more depth.\n\n\nMoreover,it was based on a true story.\n\n\nSo, What do you think?\n\n\nI don\'t think these two movies will be shown in Singapore.\n\n\nEven if they are, it be rated R(A).\n\n\nThat\'s all that is happening over here, to me, that is.\n\n\nOh yes, I have received my money from dad.\n\n\nMeanwhile, take care and keep writing.\n\n\nAll my love,\n\n\nSusanna\n\n\nPS: Reg, could you check my Chalet School series and HIGHLIGHT those\nthat I don\'t have.\n\n\nPlease send the List back to me ASAP.\n\n\nI have enclosed the list for you to highlight & send back to me.\n\n\nTHANKS! \n\n\n\n\nDearest Regina,\n\n\n27th October 1994\n\n\nMy major exams are finally over!!!\n\n\nJust one more paper to go, which is maths.\n\n\nI have 9 days to study for that so no problem, could even aim for am\nA.\n\n\nBut you know, my maths have never been strong, so I will be happy\nwith a B.\n\n\nIn fact, I am hoping to get all Bs at least.\n\n\nMy training session is on tomorrow.\n\n\nAnd them I start work on Monday.\n\n\nI work daytime and study maths night time.\n\n\nNot bad, eh?\n\n\nDon\'t worry, I am taking care of myself.\n\n\nI will be attending the meeting this Sunday.\n\n\nFirst one since my exams started.\n\n\nI have never realised that exams could be so stressful!!\n\n\nBut, believe it or not, I enjoy the stress!!!\n\n\nRegina, could you be a kind soul and buy me 2 boxes of the oil of\nUlan light cream that you use?\n\n\nI have run out of it.\n\n\nI know it\'s expensive so put it on my tab.\n\n\nI will pay you back as soon as I finished my degree and have a job.\n\n\nThank you so...oooooo much!!!\n\n\nYou don\'t have to post it to me.\n\n\nI can make do with my remaining clinique moisturizer.\n\n\nThe cream is so much better for my skin though.\n\n\nJust pass the 2 boxes to Kalthom.\n\n\nShe will be back in Singapore from the 6th November.\n\n\nShe will bring them to NZ for me in February.\n\n\nI am telling you early so that if you don\'t have the money, you can\nsave for it ! ! !\n\n\nIsn\'t that good of me?\n\n\nBy the way, WHERE ARE YOUR LETTERS?\n\n\nWHY HAVE THEY STOPPED COMING?\n\n\nARE YOU ALRIGHT?\n\n\nIS LEANNA ALRIGHT?\n\n\nARE YOU SURVIVING WITHOUT ANY ADMIRERS?\n\n\nOR HAVE YOU GOT A NEW BEAU?\n\n\nIS EVERYONE AT HOME HAPPY?\n\n\nHOW\'S MUM?\n\n\nHOW\'S EVERYBODY????\n\n\nARE YOU HAPPY?\n\n\nSo there!!\n\n\nEnough questions for you to answer in your next letter.\n\n\nWrite ASAP!!!\n\n\nAll my love,\n\n\nSusanna\n\n\nPS: Stuart says \'Hi\' to everyone. \n\n\n\n\nDear Reg,\n\n\n28/4/95\n\n\nHeard from Jo that your relationship is on-&-off.\n\n\nHeard from mum that your relationship is off and you are now trying\nto recover from a broken heart.\n\n\nEr...\n\n\nhow bad is it?\n\n\nHave you really fallen really hard for Teng Hong?\n\n\nNevermind, no matter how painful it is, you\'ll recover in time,(I\nbelieve?!)\n\n\nMum\'s letter implied that he broke it off.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nDid you quarrel?\n\n\nOr is it Aunty Loke?\n\n\nI know she does not approve of your relationship.\n\n\nBut she\'s an interfering old sop so ignore her.\n\n\nDo write and let me know if you are on or off.\n\n\nJo\'s been sending me paper articles on the arrests.\n\n\nHow is everyone?\n\n\nHope everyone is okay.\n\n\nMum says you have been a good girl.\n\n\nThanks for that.\n\n\nBut then I have always know you would \'rise to the occasion\', when\nneeded.\n\n\nI have been studying hard.\n\n\nLaw test this Thursday and I have a lot to memorise.\n\n\nSometimes I wonder how Victor survived law school.\n\n\nLaw SUCKS!!\n\n\nTime is passing pretty fast for me.\n\n\nI feel as if it is zooming!\n\n\nBefore I know it, it\'s almost May.\n\n\nMy days are full of lectures, tutorials, work and study.\n\n\nHave not been regular at meets.\n\n\nNo excuses, just being lazy and it\'s too cold to go anywhere!\n\n\nIt\'s bet.\n\n\n11oc to 18oc ( very seldom) and my feet gets frozen!\n\n\nHands too!\n\n\nAnyway, as I promised mum, I\'ll try to be really regular.\n\n\nJo told me to appreciate the freedom of worship here and I guess I\nhave started to take it for granted.\n\n\nStuart is very ( extremely) regular for his bible study.\n\n\nBut, he doesn\'t quite like meeting.\n\n\nSo I\'m trying to encourage him so that I get a ride to the kingdom\nhall and back.\n\n\nMeanwhile, take care and all my love,\n\n\nSusanna \n\n\n\n\nDearest Regina\n\n\n3/3/96\n\n\nso...\n\n\nwho\'s your new love now, or is it still Matthew?\n\n\nHow\'s life and how are you?\n\n\nWe have settled in quite nicely & we have just finally finished\nunpacking.\n\n\nWe only managed to move into 5/14 Whitaker Place only on the 22nd\nFeb.\n\n\nSchool started on the 26th Feb so we didn\'t have time to unpack.\n\n\nWe spent 4 days unloading our boxes & suitcases ( we got some from\nthe space station - about 30 boxes of all sized.\n\n\nThen during the week I unpack, attended lectures and started\nassignments.\n\n\nBecause of the semester system, exams are only 12 weeks away.\n\n\nImagine cramming 1 year\'s work into 12 weeks!\n\n\nWe have to start studying immediately.\n\n\nNo loafing at all.\n\n\n2nd week of school & I have 4 assignments to hand in.\n\n\nI feel as if I am sinking.\n\n\nThis is worse than 2nd year.\n\n\nHope I can cope this year.\n\n\nAnyway, we will write you some more later.\n\n\nMeanwhile, do write soon.\n\n\nHere\'s and old 1¢ NZ coin, not in Production anymore.\n\n\nI found this on the ground.\n\n\n( You know - see a penny, pick it up, all day long you have good\nluck!)

{'text': 'To understand what King Zi\'s view on what it is to be human, it is\nimperative to first understand his view concerning " what is more in human\nlife than meets the eye".\n\n\nAlthough it is undeniable that King Zi does not discuss about "\nstrange phenomena, violence, chaos and gods", King Zi does have a religious\nconviction about " what is more".\n\n\nHe uncritically accept the traditional idea that Tian, or heaven, is\nthe source of all things, including human culture.\n\n\nTian is intrinsically benevolent; Tian cares for the people.\n\n\nKing Zi declares that \'Tian produced the te ( virtue) in me\'.\n\n\nIn other words, te is the personal presence of Tian within.\n\n\nOriginally te was regarded as an inborn capacity possessed by the\nrulers and shamans through which the behaviours of others could be\ninfluenced.\n\n\nBut King Zi innovatively proclaims that everybody, both rulers and\ncommoners, has this te endowed by Tian and hence, everyone has the both the\ncapacity and responsibility to cultivate benevolence as Tian is benevolent.\n\n\nAs such, King Zi thinks that to be human is to be a man of benevolence\nor as he calls it, a noble man ( in Mandarin).\n\n\nAnother metaphysical or religious conviction integral to King Xi\'s\nworld view is the metaphor of family.\n\n\nKing Xi, as a transmitter of ancient heritage, believes that the\nwhole world and all there is within, consist of a big family.\n\n\nTian is reminiscent to the more ancient notion of Shan Ti (\ncollective presence of ancestral spirits) and Tian cares for the people.\n\n\nThe emperor as the son of Tian is charged with the parenting role to\ntake care of the people.\n\n\nSo, another way of conceiving of being human is, for King Xi, to be a\nresponsible family member.\n\n\nTo be a man of benevolence and to be a family member are two sides of\nthe same coin.\n\n\nBenevolence is an existential goal and it refers to the perfection of\nhuman excellence.\n\n\nEveryone is endowed by Tian the capacity to engage in ethical\ncultivation but everyone is not therefore automatically man of benevolence.\n\n\nEfforts, will, decision are all needed to be invoked to make the\ninborn capacity or moral sensibility to flourish and attain human perfection\nor benevolence.\n\n\nThe root of benevolence is Xiao ( filial piety).\n\n\nThis ordered family affection is a natural impulse.\n\n\nWhen this impulse is consciously developed and cultivated, it has the\npotential to develop into Jen ( benevolence).\n\n\nHowever, beside this natural impulse.\n\n\nThere are other selfish impulse, if unchecked, might impede the\nextension and development of the natural affection of Xiao.\n\n\nSo, discipline, effort and constant choice are all indispensable\ningredients in the process of ethical cultivation.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that King Xi believe that the records of\nthe way of the ancient sage king provides the blueprint of how heaven ( Tian)\nlive and more in this world.\n\n\nThrough the ancient record, we can see that the chou-li ( Rites) are\nthe crystalisations of Tian\'s way which means that the former sage king had\nsomehow comprehended Tian\'s way and codified it.\n\n\nSince Li is the blue-print of how Tian moves and lives in this world,\nto revive the former way of the ancient sage king or rather, to order the\nkingdom according to Tian\'s way, all that is needed is to perform the rites\naccording to the proper inner ethical attitudes or spirit.\n\n\nHowever the ancient rites are not comprehensive enough, and I wonder\nit would ever be, to provide definitive guidance to every daily mundane\ndecision.\n\n\nThis is where conscious rational thought come in.\n\n\nKing Xi thinks that it is imperative for every human to put the\ninterest of the whole above the self and do what is appropriate ( Mandarin\nword).\n\n\nAccording to King Xi, an individual\'s greatest responsibility, as Lao\nSzu King rightly perceives, is not on one\'s success and failures which are\ndetermined by Ming ( Heaven\'s decree) but on ethical cutivation.\n\n\nKing Zi unapologetically assumes that what distinguishes man from all\nother things is man\'s inborn capacity to engage in ethical cultivation and it\nis only appropriate ( or human) to devote one\'s whole life\'s energies in\nethical cultivation.\n\n\nLao Zi would not dispute that the natural order, which he calls Tao,\nwhile King Xi calls Tian, is inherently good.\n\n\nHe also would concur that we should respect the way of the former\nsage king.\n\n\nBut he disagree that man\'s greatest responsibility is to engage in\nethical cultivation.\n\n\nHe thinks that man\'s greatest responsibility is to return to the Tao\nand the way to do it is to employ " non action" - actions without effort.\n\n\nI hasten to add that although Tao Tzu\'s conception of " how" to\ncultivate or perfect our being human is different from King Xi, both converge\non the point that human should live and move in the way of the natural order.\n\n\nTao Tzu also differs in his view concerning Li ( rites).\n\n\nHe accepts the way of the former sage king but he is skeptical about\nthe claim that it can be codified.\n\n\nHe regards the performance of Li not as irrelevant but even as\ncontrary to the interests of being human.\n\n\nFurthermore, while King Xi encourages conscious rational thought in\ndiscriminating the good from the bad, he asserts that one should make no\ndistinction and cease the wavering mind from having cognitive functions.\n\n\nAs for Chan, a buddhist, he would think that ethical cultivation is a\nmere tool to prepare one to " see into one\'s buddha directly" and obviously,\nhe would say that this is just a secondary responsibility.\n\n\nFor Chan, the greatest responsibility of man is to attain\nenlightenment which is also the extinguishing of selfish desires.\n\n\nThe second part of the above discussion focuses mainly on the\ndifferences of the conceptions of how to perfect our being human according to\nthe 3 perspectives.\n\n\nIt does not mean that they have no similarity at all.\n\n\nOne salient similarity is the common believe that one needs to put\nthe interests of the whole, whether conceived of as Tian, Tao or SELF ( the\nultimate reality), above self and not to give free reign to selfish and\ndebased desires.\n\n\nKing Zi regards himself as a transmitter of ancient heritage and not\nan innovator.\n\n\nIn this essay, I will elucidate the content of the ancient heritage,\nhe transmits and the way in which he has contributed his innovative insights\nin this interpretations of the ancient heritage.\n\n\nKing Zi is a Ru scholar.\n\n\nAs a ru, he is well versed in the records of ancient heritage which\nconsist mainly, though not solely, of ancient rites and historical facts.\n\n\nHe is convinced that the reason why the former sage kings like Yao (\nMandarin) and Shun ( Mandarin) had brought peace and harmony to the kingdoms\nwas because they had somehow grasped the way of Tian; they had codified the\nway of Tian and came out with a comprehensive set of rites which mirror how\nTian moves and lives in this world.\n\n\nSince this rites have a metaphysical origin, they are natural in the\nsense it has the power to humanize and shape those who participate in it, and\nnot artificial.\n\n\nThis is perhaps why Figarate calls these holy rites or sacred\nceremonies.\n\n\nit is possible to argue that what is innovative about King Zi\'s view\nis that he asserts that it is only through the cultivation of Jen that would\ninfuse the performance of Li with the required spirit and through which, the\nLi would be enlivened and as a result, could radiate its spiritual power and\nbring peace and harmony to the land.\n\n\nHowever, as Benjamin Schwartz succinctly points out that even in some\nof the preconfucian texts, the idea of " te" with an ethical connotation was\nalready present.\n\n\n" Te" originally was believed to be a inborn capacity of the ruler.\n\n\nIf a ruler through ethical choice and effort makes his " te"\nillustrious, then he would be able to receive the mandate to rule from\nheaven.\n\n\nSo, it is evident that even before confucius, there was already the\nbelief that the performance of Li, especially by the ruler, needs to be\naccompanied with the proper inner ethical attitude and spirit.\n\n\nWhat is new about King Zi\'s idea, is that he extends the privilege of\nethical cultivation and the potential of achieving ethical perfection to the\ncommoners.\n\n\nBefore him, it was thought that " te" is the exclusive privilege of\nthe members of the ruling clan.\n\n\nBut King Zi audaciously assert that everyone can be a man of\nbenevolence and everyone has the inborn capacity and responsibility to engage\nin ethical cultivation.\n\n\nIn fact, the notion of " noble man" ( in Mandarin) denotes only the\nsons of rulers, but King Xi converts it into an ethical notion, that\nrepresent an ethical ideal of human excellence of which all man should strive\nfor.\n\n\nAnother credit that King Xi deserves is that he gives the most detail\nteachings of how to cultivate Jen, even until today.\n\n\nDespite the fact that he gives no single exhaustive definition to\nexplicate Jen, he produces different numerations of how Jen should be\npractised in different specific contexts.\n\n\nIn my opinion, King Xi greatest contribution lies with his careful\nand in-depth teaching of how to practice Jen.\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that King Xi\'s notion of Jen is also new and yet\ncontinuous with what came before.\n\n\nProfessor Lin Yu Sheng notes that the word " Jen" already appears in\n" The book of poetry" which, perhaps means " true manhood".\n\n\nWhat is unmistakable is that " Jen" originally refers only a\nparticular virtue.\n\n\nBut in King Xi\'s hands, he extends its meanings to encompass all\nparticular virtues.\n\n\nAs a result, for King Xi, Jen is a notion denoting the ultimate\nperfection of human excellence.\n\n\nAs Schwartz observes, Jen became an existential goal that one should\nconstantly strive for though it seems that one never reaches.\n\n\nI am aware that there are those who thinks that King Xi\'s greatest\ninnovation is his conception of Xi and Fingarette is a case in point.\n\n\nIn my view, this is factually erroneous.\n\n\nIn the first place, in King Xi\'s time, though there were neglect and\nmisapplication of Li, yet it is undeniable that on the whole, Li was still\nwidely practised since it is part of the ancient Chinese culture.\n\n\nAs Schwartz argues, King Xi expresses concern only when there is " a\ndiscrepancy" between the form and the spirit of Li.\n\n\nMoreover, as Waley rightly discerns the Analects do not focus on the\ndetails of Li but if is a book which primarily focused on " the general\nprinciples of moralities".\n\n\nIn conclusion, what is new and yet continuous with what came before\nis King Xi\'s ideas that everybody has the capacity to cultivate Jen and it is\nthrough the cultivation of Jen that Li could be enliven.\n\n\nWhen Li is enliven, the former way of the ancient sage king would be\nrevived and its spiritual force would be unleased.\n\n\nWithout the accompaniment of Jen, Li would degenerate into empty\nforms and this is what King Xi abhors.\n\n\nA perfect man has no name, no achievement and no use.\n\n\nA perfect man has no name because the Tao, the ultimate reality that\nthe perfect man gain mystical union with, has no name.\n\n\nNames are used to refer to a particular thing or characteristic but\nthe Tao is all-embracing.\n\n\nIt is in everything and everything is in the Tao.\n\n\nA perfect man has no achievement because like the Tao, he claims no\ncredit for himself.\n\n\nHe has no use or to be specific, he is useless because he does not\nconfine and subject himself to the artificial norms and man made standards.\n\n\nA perfect man is also one who is not found by human limitations.\n\n\nHe could roam about in the universe and ride on the " normalities of\nthe six elements".\n\n\nHe is free and eternally happy.\n\n\nUnplagued by negative human emotions, he has no worldly worries and\ncares.\n\n\nBut what must one do to become a perfect man? \n\n\nZhuang Zi tells us: fast the mind.\n\n\nHow?\n\n\nTranscend all finite points of view.\n\n\nMake no distinction.\n\n\nDon\'t affirm this or negate that for all is relative.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '46ff9478-20fb-4a6a-aaf9-d8ea4f975d84',

{'text': 'Dearest Regina,\n\n\n27th November 1994.\n\n\nA tab is a bill, you dope.\n\n\nIt means I will owe you til I can pay you back.\n\n\nThank you for the cream.\n\n\nI really appreciate it.\n\n\nYou are such a nice sister.\n\n\nCall Kalthom at 4534106 and pass it to her.\n\n\nAsk Jo not to send the hair oil, if she hasn\'t sent it yet, I\'ll make\ndo with VO5 hair oil, which isn\'t very good but it\'ll do for 3 months.\n\n\nAsk her to pass it to Kalthom to bring it back next year.\n\n\nMerci Beaucoup!\n\n\nLife on this floor is now very different, as you can see I now have a\ncomputer.\n\n\nIt\'s not mine actually, it belongs to Stuart.\n\n\nBut I get to use it anytime I like.\n\n\nI play games on it everyday.\n\n\nI am hooked on tetris and taipei and minesweeper.\n\n\nI also have got a TV in my room as well as a shelf for it thanks top\nMatt.\n\n\nMatt is my neighbour and he has gone back to Wellington.\n\n\nHe is Andrea\'s boyfriend and Andrea has gone back to Singapore.\n\n\nIn fact, most of my friends have gone back to their homelands.\n\n\nOn this floor, I still have Stuart, room 356, Ronald, room 349,\nScott, room 317.\n\n\nThe rest of the floor is taken up by new people, some of them kiddies\nthat I can\'t stand.\n\n\nThe lady who took over Matt\'s room is Ana, a Portuguese lady.\n\n\nShe reminds me of Aunty Connie.\n\n\nThomas ( my German friend) & his girlfriend Barbel ( last name\nOswald) have gone on their 4 week trip to South Island, so almost all the old\ngang have left.\n\n\nIt like living on a kid\'s floor, thanks to Geshan our warden, who has\nstacked this floor with people he likes, and there not many of those people\naround.\n\n\nRonald was telling us that a lot of people are going to send in some\nletters of complaint to the accommodation office.\n\n\nI am suppose to send in my letter of complaint as well.\n\n\nI want to add my two bits about how he threatened my accommodation\nreference letter when he alleged that I said something bad about him.\n\n\nHe got so personal and as warden he should not.\n\n\nI got mad because I didn\'t say anything about him and got blamed for\nit.\n\n\nHe refused to listen to me at all as he had already made up his\nstubborn mind.\n\n\nWhen Stuart, his good friend, talked to him about the whole matter,\nhe realised his mistake but was too pig-headed to apologies.\n\n\nAfter the matter blew over, he was very nice to me.\n\n\nI think it is because of Stuart hate people who abuse their power, as\nGeshan has done.\n\n\nStuart took me to Dennys for dinner on Monday, that was the day his\nlittle brother ( by the way, he is over 6 feet and 3 feet wide) flew to\nEngland.\n\n\nHis friends bought him 10 beers before he flew on United Airline (\nplane was delayed due to mechanical failure), so we wished him luck.\n\n\nI know Craig personally as Stuart introduced my to him earlier in the\nyear.\n\n\nWork is getting mundane although my colleagues are very nice.\n\n\nI get to meet a lot of student, some of whom I met again when I went\nto see \'The Specialist\'.\n\n\nStu and I had steamboat with Ferdy from the 2nd floor and this girl,\nAngeline, whom he has the hots for.\n\n\nAngeline said I look familiar and I told her I work at Student Job\nSearch.\n\n\nShe then said, " oh, yah, that\'s right, you registered me!" It was\nquite funny.\n\n\nI also met Angeline\'s flatmate.\n\n\nSusanna at the cinema.\n\n\nNo, not me, another girl who\'s name is spelled exactly the same as\nmine.\n\n\nI know because I also registered her at SJS.\n\n\nShe saw me and greeted me rather warmly.\n\n\nNo hugs though.\n\n\nI rather like the weather here at the moment.\n\n\nIt is glorious, with the sun shining brightly and warmly, with a cool\nbreeze to take away the sting of the sun\'s rays on the skin.\n\n\nI take quite a lot of walks.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I also eat quite alot so I have not lost the\nadditional weight I gained.\n\n\nCome to think of it, I am quite plump.\n\n\nI got Singapore Airlines postcard from JuEe & Jennie the other day,\nand one from Kalthom who wrote from Melaka.\n\n\nI also received a postcard from Thomas, it was Mitre Peak.\n\n\nHe said that he loved Stewart Island but hated Invercargill.\n\n\nWee Ching sent a letter also, strange letter.\n\n\nHe wrote " I have arrived in one peace in New Zealand"(where does he\nthink he is?)" I had quite a peaceful journey and thankfully did not suffer\nand sexual harassment by Andrea who strangely went to the toilet many many\ntimes" He said that the Christmas lights are up in Singapore.\n\n\nI am missing home alot now, as I would have loved Orchard Rd with my\nsisters and enjoy the lights.\n\n\nI got Ronald a job selling xmas cards.\n\n\nI also got Simon a job at a factory, Anthony selling xmas cards as\nwell and this Fijian guy a factory job.\n\n\nI can\'t remember his name but he saw me at the lobby of Huia and\nthanked me for the introduction.\n\n\nStu just got a part time job at the motel opposite Huia.\n\n\nIts Grafton Oaks Motel.\n\n\nDoing the laundry.\n\n\nHa!\n\n\nHa!\n\n\nHa!\n\n\nWatch out for dirty towels.\n\n\nHe is quite happy with it though.\n\n\nIts better than loafing around and waiting for the dole to roll in.\n\n\nStuart also did a 4 hour job for\n&dollar;35 cash yesterday.\n\n\nI rang him and asked if he wanted the job of packing T-shirts.\n\n\nIt sounded east enough.\n\n\nBut when he got there, he packed T-shirts, shifted bricks,\nphotocopied files and painted round the office.\n\n\nHe told me he did so much work, its not worth\n&dollar;35!!! \n\n\nAnyway, that\'s\n&dollar;35 more to spend.\n\n\nThere was also another 4 hour job helping some researchers at the med\nschool move furniture.\n\n\nIt was on a Sat.\n\n\nmorning so I did it along with Stuart and Charles ( my colleague) and\nJosh ( and Australian guy doing a tourism diploma here).\n\n\nI got\n&dollar;40 cash.\n\n\nNot bad, eh?\n\n\nIt was hard work though, I woke up on Sunday with aches and pains all\nover and could hardly move.\n\n\nStayed in bed most of the day.\n\n\nI did go for meet though.\n\n\nThe uni results are coming in so..oo slowly, its unbelievable.\n\n\nSo far, I have got 2 of my results.\n\n\nB for management and C for calculus.\n\n\nI am quite satisfied with mgt.\n\n\naccounting but not calculus.\n\n\nI don\'t seem to have a knack for maths.\n\n\nI study like mad and get only a C.\n\n\nThankfully, I do 3 accounting papers next year, so I should get alot\nmore better results next year.\n\n\nI also have devised new study methods suitable for me, which I can\'t\nwait to implement next year.\n\n\nWill write and let you know the rest of my results.\n\n\nBy the way, be a kind soul and do look for my chalet school series\nand do a stock take for me.\n\n\nThey have the latest ones here in the bookshop and I want to complete\nmy set.\n\n\nPlease!?\n\n\nMeanwhile take care and write soon.\n\n\nYour sister,\n\n\nSusanna. \n\n\n\n\nDearest Regina,\n\n\n1st January 1995\n\n\nThanks for buying the cream for me.\n\n\nI am unable to contact Kalthom at all.\n\n\nCall Jin instead.\n\n\nShe is Kalthom\'s best friend.\n\n\nHer Phone no. is 4596870.\n\n\nTell her you have got something for me and you want to pass it to\nKalthom to bring over to NZ.\n\n\nMaybe you could make arrangements with her to meet Kalthom.\n\n\nEverything is routine and as usual around here.\n\n\nI am still working at Student Job Search and had 4 statutory\nholidays, 2 at xmas and 2 for new year, which is on Mon and Tue.\n\n\nI intend to relax and clean up my room which is due for a thorough\ncleaning.\n\n\nDon\'t worry, I am still looking after my spiritually.\n\n\nHong Mei Mei just wrote to me.\n\n\nHer letter is so spiritual, I am not sure what to write to her.\n\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n\nI have gotten No.\n\n\n14 Whitaker Place for the new academic year and am slowly packing to\nmove.\n\n\nMatt, my ex-neighbour, is in Singapore at the moment with Andrea.\n\n\nAndrea rang me to ask what papers I am doing in my 2nd year and we\nhad a chat.\n\n\nShe said she is glad Matt is there with her.\n\n\nMatt is feeling extremely hot but is surviving alright.\n\n\nAuckland is hot at the moment too, Glorious weather, with the sun\nshining, clear blue sky and cool winds.\n\n\nThe perfect weather.\n\n\nHot!\n\n\nHot!\n\n\nHot!\n\n\nDuring the xmas hols, I went down to Gisborne with Stuart and had a\nfabulous holiday.\n\n\nIt was an 8 hour drive down.\n\n\nIt is hot at Gisborne, as hot as Singapore.\n\n\nLuckily, Gisborne is situated at the East Coast, so we had cool\nwinds to keep us cool.\n\n\nI met Stuart\'s parents, Rena and Dexter, and they are very nice.\n\n\nI got the guest bedroom, which Stuart said he had always wanted to\nstay in.\n\n\nHa!\n\n\nHa!\n\n\nHe stayed in his own room.\n\n\nHe told his parents that I don\'t celebrate xmas but I got presents\nanyway.\n\n\nThey say it\'s a \'welcome to our home\' gift.\n\n\nThey are very hospitable people.\n\n\nStuart told them I am a typical tourist and they took me round to\nsee the sights of Gisborne, such as Kaiti Hill, Capt.\n\n\nCook\'s landing site, Wylie Cottage ( the oldest cottage in\nGisborne), the museum etc.\n\n\nI think they enjoyed it as much as I did.\n\n\nI really enjoyed myself as I had free accommodation, free food and\ncontributed only\n&dollar;40 to Stuart for the petrol.\n\n\nCheap holiday!!!\n\n\nWe spent Sat, Sun.\n\n\nand Mon.\n\n\nthere and drove back on Tuesday.\n\n\nThen it was back to work on Wed, Thu and Fri.\n\n\nOn Fri night, Ronald organised a group to see " Timecop" starring\nClaude Vam Damme, and invited me.\n\n\nSo I went.\n\n\nThere were about 7 of us.\n\n\nThe show was quite good.\n\n\nOne of Claude Van Damme\'s better movies.\n\n\nThen I spent New Years Eve with my colleague, Kill, and her\nboyfriend Ray.\n\n\nStuart was invited too, so the four of us had a cozy chatting and\nplaying board games, Cluedo and a game invented by Ray.\n\n\nWe were so involved in the boardgame, we didn\'t realise that the new\nyear had arrived.\n\n\nStuart and I went home at about 2am.\n\n\nWe had lunch and dinner there with Ray and Jill.\n\n\nVery nice people.\n\n\nThat\'s about it.\n\n\nHope you are having a good time.\n\n\nDo write soon.\n\n\nEven a short letter would be appreciated.\n\n\nHope to hear from you soon.\n\n\nLove,\n\n\nSusanna. \n\n\n\n\nDearest Regina,\n\n\n7th February 1995.\n\n\nSorry for not writing earlier as I have been busy.\n\n\nI have been working at Auckland Domain ( a big park) at 23 major\nevents on 2 Saturdays consecutively.\n\n\nYou would have loved to be there!\n\n\nOn 28th Jan., there was the Opera-in-the-park.\n\n\nNot so famous opera singers sang pieces from different opera like\nRigoletto and Faust ( I think).\n\n\nI worked at fast food stand, selling hotdogs and hot chips.\n\n\nI enjoyed the finale more than anything else.\n\n\nThey had everyone singing from Rigoletto, I am not sure which piece,\nfireworks and laser al at one time.\n\n\nIt was fabulous!!!\n\n\nSo beautiful and romantic.\n\n\nMany people ( about 200,000) slowly streamed in.\n\n\nThe kiasu ones came as early as 10 am to \'chop\' the front area.\n\n\nForget to tell you that its all FREE.\n\n\nSome brought wine glasses and snacks.\n\n\nI really wished you were here as I know you would have really\nenjoyed and appreciated it.\n\n\nOn the following Saturday, 4th Feb, they had

today though I didn\'t go on Sunday\nas I was really sick.\n\n\nI spend Sunday and Monday in bed.\n\n\nStuart took me to the pharmacy to buy some medicine.\n\n\nIt cost me\n&dollar;10.90 for the flu

weeks, with working,\nenrolling and moving into Whitaker Place.\n\n\nWill give you my new address soon Meanwhile, direct your mail here.\n\n\nHow\'s life at home?\n\n\nHope all of you are holding out well.\n\n\nNow that dad\'s disowned us, we can get on with our lives without\nhim.\n\n\nJah\'s blessings can now shower unhindered on our household, so pray\nto Him and ask for his help and

C\'wealth Drive\nICE-SIN:#08-732\n\n\nSingapore ( 0314)\n\n\nJuly 1993\n\n\nDear Chia Keng Seng,\n\n\nAt Citibank, we understand what a person goes through when applying\nfor a personal loan.\n\n\nYou attend interviews at the banks, fill up lengthy forms, get asked\nto submit extensive income documents, and tell a complete stranger why you\nneed a loan.\n\n\nNext, you wait around for a week or two, and finally you get a letter\nsaying " approved" or " declined".\n\n\nDefinitely a tedious process.\n\n\nAt Citibank, we\'ve simplified the process.\n\n\nIt\'s faster.\n\n\nAnd much more straightforward.\n\n\nYou don\'t need to pledge any collateral.\n\n\nYou don\'t need to attend any lengthy interviews.\n\n\nIn fact, there\'s no need to visit the bank.\n\n\nAll you need to do is complete the enclosed Application Form and mail\nit to us, along with your latest IR8A form or your latest computerized\npay-slip or a letter from your employer.\n\n\nWithin 5 days, we\'ll send you a check for the net value of your\npersonal loan ( see Monthly Repayment Table in brochure) when your\napplication is approved.\n\n\nSo, you can now expand your business with the capital you need.\n\n\nOr realize that long overdue dream to do up your home.\n\n\nOr join a country club.\n\n\nIn other words, you are free to use the money in any way you see fit.\n\n\nThere will be no questions asked.\n\n\nAnd Citibank Personal Loan is also easy to manage.\n\n\nHere\'s how it works: The interest rate is fixed.\n\n\nSo is the monthly repayment.\n\n\nThat means, you don\'t have to worry about interest rate fluctuations\nwhich can increase your monthly repayment.\n\n\nEach month, you\'ll receive a statement of account that tells you the\ntotal balance outstanding, the repayment amount, and the due date for\npayment, which is 20 days after the statement date.\n\n\nFor repayment, simply mail us a check using the pre-paid envelope\nyou\'ll receive with your monthly statement.\n\n\nJust take a look at the Monthly Repayment Table in the enclosed\nbrochure, and choose the amount ( net value of the loan) and the term (\nrepayment period) that suits you best.\n\n\nAt Citibank, we make each process as easy as possible.\n\n\nSo, why not put an end to wasting time visiting other banks, and\nwaiting around for an answer?\n\n\nIf you would like a Citibank Personal Loan right now, just complete\nthe Application Form and send it to us today.\n\n\nYours sincerely\n\n\nChristine Teng\n\n\nBusiness Manager/Vice President\n\n\nP/S If you\'d like to talk to someone about

you, I thought I\'d write to you again.\n\n\nPerhaps the last time I wrote, you didn\'t see a need to spend\n&dollar;60 on the Citibank Ready Credit annual fee.\n\n\nAnd, even now, you still feel the same way.\n\n\nThat\'s fine, if you only think of the fee as a way to start an\naccount with us.\n\n\nBut, when you consider what you\'re really buying - the power and\nconvenience of a large, personal cash reserve - then I\'m sure you\'ll agree\nthat\'s worth a great deal more than just\n&dollar;60! \n\n\nBesides, have you thought of those unexpected times when you\nsuddenly need extra cash?\n\n\nWith Citibank Ready Credit, you\'re ready for any kind of situation.\n\n\nFor when new business opportunities crop up, or when you need a quick\nbreak from the pressure of work, in some exciting city or romantic resort.\n\n\nWith Citibank Ready Credit by your side, you\'ll always have the\nsecurity of a solid backup of cash, and the freedom to respond quickly to any\nopportunity or emergency that may come your way.\n\n\nAny time, any place.\n\n\nPlus, you decide how much you want to use.\n\n\nAnd, how long you\'d like to use it for.\n\n\nYou can draw on your credit line for as short as a day, a week, a\nmonth or longer.\n\n\nIt\'s your choice.\n\n\nRepayment is easy too.\n\n\nAgain, it\'s up to you.\n\n\nWhether you want to pay in part or in full.\n\n\nThe best part is, if you don\'t use Citibank Ready Credit, you don\'t\nhave to pay interest on it.\n\n\nBut, when you do need ready cash, you\'ll always be prepared.\n\n\nBecause Citibank Ready Credit puts a Citibank checkbook in your\nhands.\n\n\nJust write a check, for any amount.\n\n\nEven up to your full credit line.\n\n\nOr use the Citicard ( ATM card) to withdraw up to\n&dollar;2,000 cash a day.\n\n\nFrom any of our conveniently located ATMs.\n\n\nIn addition, there is a whole host of value-added extras that come\nwith Citibank Ready Credit.\n\n\nWith our 24-hour CitiPhone Banking, you can always depend on us.\n\n\nJust one phone call, that\'s all you need.\n\n\nWhether it\'s to update your account or to request a temporary\nextension on your credit line in a medical emergency.\n\n\nWe\'re here to help.\n\n\nThere is also the 24-hour Worldwide Personal Accident Protection of\nup to\n&dollar;150 000, which no other bank in Singapore offers.\n\n\nAnd Credit Life Benefit which cancels the outstanding balance on your\naccount should the unforeseen happen.\n\n\nMy invitation to you to apply for Citibank Ready Credit is still\nopen.\n\n\nI urge you to apply for ready cash today.\n\n\nJust complete the enclosed Application Form and mail it back before\n20 August 1993.\n\n\nThere\'s no need for collateral or a guarantor.\n\n\nYou don\'t need to come in for an interview.\n\n\nBecause you don\'t know when you\'ll need extra cash, it pays to be\nprepared.\n\n\nTo give yourself as many options as possible.\n\n\nEspecially for those times when you will need cash, fast.\n\n\nAnd for that, you can always depend on Citibank Ready Credit and the\nworld-famous Citibank service.\n\n\nDon\'t miss out this time.\n\n\nAccept my invitation today.\n\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\nChristine

also save up to 40% at the Hilton International group of\nhotels in the city you visit.\n\n\nAnd, there are 21 Qantas destinations to choose from.\n\n\nSo, you can go ahead and plan a holiday almost anywhere between\nKuala Lumpur and London, or Jakarta and Honolulu.\n\n\nThere\'s no limit to the number of Qantas tickets you can buy with\nyour Citibank Miles Ahead travel points.\n\n\nThe more

regular rate.\n\n\nJust to give you a chance to have a relaxing weekend away from it\nall, without having to actually get away.\n\n\nThe Citibank Miles Ahead travel program has just begun.\n\n\nSo, there\'s plenty of time for you to take full advantage of it.\n\n\nAnd to get you off to a good start, you will receive 10 bonus travel\npoints ( worth\n&dollar;1,000 in card charges), with our

Ordinary Crossed\nCheques \n\n\nOrdinary cheques with crossings such as " Account Payee Only", "\nAccount Payee", " Not Negotiable" will continue to be processed through the\npresent automated clearing system without additional charges or delay in\npayment.\n\n\nAlthough cheques bearing the " Account Payee Only" and " Not\nNegotiable" crossings remain transferable in law, in ordinary circumstances,\nthey offer adequate protection against losses arising from fraud or\nmisappropriation of cheques as banks ordinarily collect Account Payee cheques\nonly for the named payee.\n\n\nFurther, " Not Negotiable\' crossings on cheques which are affected\nby fraud, or are stolen, prevent the fraudulent parties or thieves and any\nsubsequent transferee of such cheques from acquiring good title.\n\n\nWhat are \' Non-Transferable Cheques?\n\n\nNon-transferable cheques include cheques with the crossing " Not\nTransferable" and those bearing any form of crossing and accompanied by the\nword " only" after the payee\'s name.\n\n\ne.g. pay to " XYZ only".\n\n\nThese cheques will be subject to charges and take a longer time to\nbe cleared for payment.\n\n\n Reasons for Manual Processing of Non-Transferable Cheques \n\n\nUnlike the ordinary crossed cheques, non-transferable cheques impose\nan additional responsibility on the paying bank to ensure that only the named\npayee receives the funds.\n\n\nHowever, the paying bank cannot ascertain this through the automated\nclearing system which only allows the paying bank to make payment on\nindividual cheques through the collecting bank and not to the payees\ndirectly.\n\n\nHence non-transferable cheques have to be processed manually outside\nof the automated clearing system.\n\n\nThe charges levied on the drawer ( S&dollar;20) and the payee ( S&dollar;5) are\nnecessary to cover the additional work required to process these cheques.\n\n\nWe hope that the above has sufficiently clarified your enquiries on\nnon-transferable cheques.\n\n\nHowever, do contact us if you need further details.\n\n\nYours faithfully,.\n\n\nJANICE GOH ( MRS).\n\n\nVICE PRESIDENT.\n\n\nCONSUMER BANKING. \n\n\n\n\nSeptember 1993.\n\n\nDear Card member,  A Dream Holiday To America...Absolutely Free\n\n\n\nFrom the alpine resorts of Switzerland, we now bring you America,\nthe land of the free.\n\n\nWhere you could be in the pulsating cities of Chicago, Boston,\nOrlando, New York, Las Vegas or San Francisco.

been due in no small way to your contributions.\n\n\nAs at 31 December 1992, NUS staff pledged and donated\n&dollar;1.8 million.\n\n\nIt is encouraging to note that the support comes from a wide\ncrosssection of staff: from deans, lecturers, research staff and\nadministrative staff to campus wardens and cleaning attendants.\n\n\nI would like to say on behalf of the Fund Raising Committee that we\nare grateful to each and every one of you for your generosity and we hope to\nhave your continued support.\n\n\nFor those who have not donated to the Fund, it is not too late.\n\n\nThe UEF Secretariat Office at the Alumni Affairs and Development\nOffice, NUS, will be glad to answer any queries you have.\n\n\nI myself graduated from the National University of Singapore, then\nknown as the University of Malaya.\n\n\nI believe that graduates like myself are lucky to have received an\nexcellent education from the University and I consider it a great opportunity\nto contribute to the education of the new generation of university students\nupon whom the future of our nation depends.\n\n\nAlthough some of you may not have graduated from this University, you\nare very much a part of it because you are teaching and working in it.\n\n\nI believe it will generate a sense of satisfaction for university\nstaff to donate something to their University through the Universities\nEndowment Fund.\n\n\nFor NUS is indeed your University, and you should take pride that\nyour contribution as a member of staff of the University and a donor to the\nUEF will help the University attain international renown as a centre of\nacademic excellence.\n\n\nYour relationship with the University should not of course stop here.\n\n\nThere are so many activities on the campus where input from the\nuniversity staff will be very much appreciated.\n\n\nOne of the major projects we are organising is a 100-km Ultramarathon\non Sunday, 18 July 1993.\n\n\nA brochure and registration form are

I\nam afraid it would not be possible to stage a full length play at the UN Day\nDinner owing to the constraints of time and technical facilities.\n\n\nThe stage at the Mandarin Ballroom is not properly equipped and the\nacoustics of the place also leaves much to be desired.\n\n\nAs such, we would not be able to do full justice to your\nmiseen-scene.\n\n\nHowever, the UN Day Dinner is not until October 23, so if you do\ndecide to change your mind, we would still be happy to accommodate a short\nsketch of 15 to 20 minutes.\n\n\nI am currently in charge of the Theatre Studies programme at the NUS\nand have a group of fairly talented students who would be more than willing\nto perform.\n\n\nThe occasion offers extremely good exposure.\n\n\nI believe you are being unnecessarily modest, but will respect\nwhatever decision you make.\n\n\nIncidentally, I am also researching a paper on sexual taboos and\ntheir infringement in recent Singapore drama, and understand that you have\nwritten a Mandarin play which might be of some interest.\n\n\nI am fairly conversant in Mandarin and would appreciate a copy of\nthis play.\n\n\nLet me end by wishing you every success in your

realise\ntime is of the essence, and given the fact that Holiday Inn Golden Mile due\nto their existing package cannot embark on a similar project until July 1992,\nwe will have to think of an alternative promotion.\n\n\n\nHowever, we hope that Holiday Inn Golden Mile might still be willing\nto consider implementing our version of the Bonus scheme in say, March 1992.\n\n\n\n3) The mechanics of the Bonus scheme are as follows:-\n\n\n\na) Deluxe Room\n\n\n\nSingle occupancy at S&dollar;190.00++\n\n\n\nDouble occupancy at S&dollar;210.00++\n\n\n\nb) Executive Club Single occupancy at S&dollar;255.00++ Double occupancy at\nS&dollar;285.00++\n\n\n\nRates for the Executive Club are inclusive of the following:\n\n\n\nGuest will be eligible to accumulate bonus points on his master\nbill.\n\n\n\nWelcome drink and fruit basket.\n\n\n\nContinental breakfast.\n\n\n\nRe-confirmation of air tickets.\n\n\n\nFor every S&dollar;300 spent, the guest will earn 10 points.\n\n\n\nA complimentary room night in a Deluxe room is worth 100 points and\nin an Executive Club room the value is 120 points.\n\n\n\nThe promotion would run for two months and be redeemable in the\nfollowing two to three months.\n\n\n\n4) The main concern for all properties is that any one hotel might 'lose'\nout if all they are doing is giving out free nights.\n\n\n\nMr Horsburgh suggests that each hotel's coupons be colourcoded so\nthat at the end of the promotion, we can see which hotel gave away more\ncomplimentary nights to which property.\n\n\n\nFor all to break even therefore, a common value should be placed on\nall coupons ( say one coupon is equivalent to S&dollar;160, 2,300 Baht and HK&dollar;800)\nand arrangements can be made for each hotel to be paid back what it is owed.\n\n\n\nWe hope to be able to iron out all the 'kinks' when everyone gets\ntogether at the Sales and Marketing Conference in a few weeks time.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, I hope that this will be of some assistance to you.\n\n\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n\n\nYours sincerely\n\n\n\nSamini Murugan\n\n\n\nPR and Advertising Manager\n\n\n\ncc: Mr Michael \n\n\n\nHorsburgh Mr Eric Lim Mr

you on 18 September 1993 and I received a reply\nfrom Mr Daniel Tan.\n\n\nI then replied to him on 29 October 1993.\n\n\nA copy of the letter is attached here for your reference.\n\n\n2 I received your letter dated 29 November 1993 and to my dismay, I\nam again unsuccessful in the 4th Quarter 1993 Booking Programme to purchase a\n5-Room flat in Bukit Merah.\n\n\n3 After every booking programme I have become more and more\ndisillusioned.\n\n\nThe hope of owning a bigger flat is becoming more and more like an\nimpossible pursuit.\n\n\nIf you go through your records, you will notice that I have submitted\nclose to ten applications to purchase a flat and each time I was\nunsuccessful.\n\n\n4 I have been notified by you on 28 May ' 93 that I am placed on the\nreserve list after being unsuccessful in the 2nd Quarter Booking Programme\nfor a 4-room flat in Queenstown.\n\n\nTo date, I am still anxiously waiting for your reply as to whether\nthere are balance flats or whether all the flats have been taken up.\n\n\nThis time I am again notified that I am placed on the reserve list\nfor the 4th Quarter Booking Programme.\n\n\nHow long will I have to wait to know of the outcome, since I have yet\nto be notified about the outcome of the 2nd Quarter Booking Programme?\n\n\nSurely there must be ways to expedite the selection of flats.\n\n\n5 There must be a fairer system to allocate flats to applicants than\nthe present balloting system as one seems to have to be really lucky to be\nsuccessfully allocated a flat.\n\n\nI am utterly disappointed with the HDB as every unsuccessful\napplication in each quarter implies a loss of additional thousands of dollars\nas the price of HDB flats escalate every quarter.\n\n\nI am disgruntled and in my mind I am wondering whether I'll ever get\nto upgrade to a bigger flat or has this dream been shattered already.\n\n\nPlease reply.\n\n\nYours sincerely \n\n\n\n\n29 October 1993\n\n\nMr Daniel Tan\n\n\nSales

Tan,\n\n\nThank you for your letter dated 18 October 1993.\n\n\n2 You have advised me to apply for a flat in non-mature estates such\nas Woodlands and Jurong West.\n\n\nIf you have gone through my previous applications you will have\nnoted that I have applied numerous times for a flat even at Yishun and Ang Mo\nKio for the previous few exercises for resale/new flats but was unsuccessful.\n\n\nYou have also advised me to consider buying a flat in the open\nmarket.\n\n\nAs a Singapore citizen who has spent two-and-a half years serving\nthe country and who is also liable for reservist, I see no valid reason as to\nwhy I should purchase a flat from the open-market especially when prices of\n5-room flats have sky-rocketed over the years and it is almost impossible to\npurchase a flat in the open-market.\n\n\nMoreover, I strongly feel that the open-market should only be a\nsource to enable permanent residents to purchase a flat and not for\nSingaporeans who have made sacrifices for their country.\n\n\n3 You have mentioned that there is a high demand for flats in\nQueenstown.\n\n\nHowever, I am very surprised to learn that some friends of mine are\nallocated a flat in Queenstown despite being their first attempt and despite\nnot being a resident of this area.\n\n\nThe reason being that they are first-time home owners.\n\n\nPerhaps the HDB should stop giving priority to first-time home\nowners in mature estates and set aside these estates for residents residing\nthere.\n\n\n4 I have submitted an application to buy a 5-room flat in Bukit\nMerah in the 4th Quarter 1993 Booking Programme.\n\n\nThis is my eighth attempt and I hope that the HDB will seriously\nconsider my application for the flat.\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nYours sincerely \n\n\n\n\nHOUSING AND

is\ngenerally divided into 2 categories: those in non-mature estates such as\nJurong West and Woodlands where land is available for development; and those\nin mature estates such as Toa Payoh and Bedok where there is very little land\nto build new flats.\n\n\nThe demand for flats in mature estates is always very high.\n\n\nHence, the success rate to be shortlisted to book a flat in the\nmature estates is low.\n\n\n3 For mature estates, HDB has from October 1992 implemented the\nResidents Priority Scheme ( RPS) under the Booking System.\n\n\nUnder this scheme, residents of mature estates who apply for new\nflats in their estates are given twice the success rate over non-resident\napplicants in the ballot.\n\n\nTo be eligible, a resident applicant must be currently either a\nlessee, tenant or an authorised occupier in an HDB flat within the estate\napplied for and have lived there for at least 5 years at the time of\napplication.\n\n\n4 We note that you applied for a 4-room flat in Queenstown for the\n2nd Quarter 1993 Booking Programme.\n\n\nAs you have resided in Queenstown for more than 5 years, your\napplication was processed under the RPS.\n\n\nHowever, we wish to explain that the allocation of flats ultimately\ndepends on the demand and supply of flats in the estate applied for.\n\n\nIn the 2nd Quarter 1993, we received a total of 3104 applications\nfor the 228 units of 4-room flats offered for sale in Queenstown.\n\n\nOf these applications, 1060 were from residents of Queenstown.\n\n\nAs demand far exceeded the supply of flats, we regret that you were\nnot shortlisted to book a flat even though your application was considered\nunder the RPS.\n\n\n5 You have enquired about the balance flats in Queenstown.\n\n\nAs you are placed on the Reserve List, you will be invited to select\na flat based on your queue position in the list should there be any balance\nof 4-room flats in Queenstown.\n\n\nWe will also inform applicants on the Reserve List if there are no\nmore balance flats available.\n\n\n6 If you wish to be allocated a flat earlier, we would advise that\nyou widen your choice of estates and apply for a flat in non-mature estates\nsuch as Jurong West or Woodlands.\n\n\nSince January 1992, HDB has implemented the Revised Balloting Scheme\n( RBS) to assist applicants in their applications for flats in non-mature\nestates.\n\n\nUnder this scheme, applicants who are new households and those who\nhave submitted earlier applications for flats in non-mature estates each\nquarter are accorded priority in the ballot.\n\n\nWith RBS, an applicant's chance of being allocated a flat is\nenhanced at each subsequent ballot as long as he applies each quarter for a\nflat in the non-mature estates.\n\n\n7 If you wish to apply for an HDB flat under the Booking System\nagain, you will have to submit to us your Application Form together with the\n&dollar;10 coupon.\n\n\nThe 4th Quarter 1993 Booking Programme is currently open for\napplications from 1 Oct 93 to 21 Oct 93.\n\n\nDetails on the estates and flat types for booking were published in\nthe Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao on 1 Oct 93.\n\n\n8 If you are in urgent need of a flat, you may also consider buying\na resale flat from the open market.\n\n\nThe advantage of buying resale flats is that they are ready for\noccupation.\n\n\nHDB may assist by granting you a mortgage loan for the purchase of a\nresale flat of up to 80% of the market value of the resale flat or 80% of\ntransacted resale price, whichever is lower.\n\n\nWith this enhanced financing, you would have a wider choice of\nresale flats that are within your affordability.\n\n\nYours sincerely\n\n\nD L TAN\n\n\nfor HEAD, SALES UNIT\n\n\nESTATE ADMIN and PROPERTY DEPARTMENT\n\n\nESTATES and LANDS DIVISION \n\n\n\n 18 September 1993\n\n Mr Lim Seng Huat Head, Sales Unit\n\n Housing and Development Board ( Sales Unit) HDB Centre\n\n 3451 Jalan Bukit Merah\n\n Singapore 0315\n\n Dear Sir,\n\n I refer to your letter dated 28 May 93.\n\n From your letter, I have been informed that I have been unsuccessful\nin the ballot to buy a 4-room flat in Queenstown Estate in the 2nd Quarter\n1993 Booking Programme and have been placed on the reserve list. \n\n Since then, I have been waiting anxiously for your reply.\n\n This is because we are in genuine need for a bigger flat as our\npresent 3-room flat is grossly inadequate.\n\n I now have to share my bed-room with my twenty-two year old sister\nand I appeal to your understanding of this inconvenience.\n\n My purpose in writing is to enquire whether there are any balance\nflats in Queenstown.\n\n In addition, I will like to inform you that I will like to be\nconsidered for a 5-room flat at Queenstown if there is any available.\n\n Kindly inform me of the outcome.\n\n Your action is deeply appreciated.\n\n Please reply.\n\n Thank you.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

However I pointed out to him that I had on several occasions\nstumbled across such words over our local newspaper and bulletins.\n\n Still, he denied saying that " newspapers can be wrong".\n\n I then quoted a recent Straits Times report where the word was used.\n\n " President Marcos last night speaking over a private network, owned\nby one of his close associates, has frequested urgings from the White House\nand the Filipino people to stop asking him to step down as President".\n\n 3. Finally, being a respected and competent institution on the\nEnglish Language in Singapore we humbly seek clarification from you on its\nlegality and acceptability of such words in modern English.\n\n This would certainly help to diffuse our confusions and at the same\ntime, enhance our knowledge.\n\n 4.

And if, by any unfortunate chance, you need intensive care,\nthe whole thing doubles again and you could claim up to\n&dollar;143,000. \n\n\nIn other words, this plan guarantees to pay out for two\nsolid years.\n\n\nFor 730 days.\n\n\nIn addition to any other insurance policies.\n\n\nAnd it doesn\'t even matter which type of hospital; government,\nprivate, or overseas.\n\n\nIf you\'re laid up, it pays out.\n\n\nAnd, best of all, if you don\'t make a claim, you get a 25% no-claim\nbonus every year.\n\n\nA cheque in the mail.\n\n\nGuaranteed.\n\n\nFor more details, please take a look at the enclosed brochure.\n\n\nI think you\'ll agree that for only 33 cents a day, it\'s well worth\nit.\n\n\nIt pays real money, big bucks, when you need it most, to spend in any\nway you like.\n\n\nOkay, I know it\'s hard to get excited about insurance.\n\n\nAnd tougher still to imagine yourself lying in the hospital with your\nMediShield, Medisave and employer\'s insurance running out.\n\n\nAnd everyday, hospital costs are going up and up.\n\n\nAnd what about your family?\n\n\nWhile you\'re hospitalised, they will be facing real money worries\nlike how they\'ll pay the PUB bills, the grocery bills, the tuition fees and\nall the rest of it.\n\n\nBut now you know about FamilyCare.\n\n\nWhich automatically makes you one of the lucky ones.\n\n\nFor just a few cents a day, you can make sure you\'ll never be caught\nsaying, " If only I\'d known, I\'d have got that extra cover..."

The Personal Accident Protector - which pays up to\n&dollar;600,000 for accidental death or disability.\n\n\nIt came with 30 days free cover no-obligation trial and guaranteed\nacceptance.\n\n\nPlus you could enrol right away.\n\n\nNo medical examination required or any payment upfront.\n\n\nThis offer ends 30 November 1993 and we\'re concerned that some of\nyou have either overlooked my first letter or just didn\'t receive it and will\ntherefore miss out on this opportunity.\n\n\nNow, I\'m writing again to alert you that there\'s still time to enrol\nto enjoy 30 days free cover with absolutely no obligation.\n\n\nThat is, if you haven\'t already done so.\n\n\nI\'m sure you would welcome another opportunity to reconsider.\n\n\nBecause even with such a small premium, the cover offers: up to\nS&dollar;200,000 cash in the event of permanent total disability, loss of limbs, or\nloss of sight due to an accident S&dollar;150,000 cash in the event of death due to\na road traffic accident, or S&dollar;100,000 for other types of accident S&dollar;300 per\nmonth for 60 months to each dependent child, if either one of the insured\nparents suffers a fatal accident or up to S&dollar;600,000 to ensure your children\'s\nfuture if the worst should happen, and you and your insured spouse are both\nkilled in the same accident What\'s more, it protects you all year round, day\nor night, worldwide.\n\n\nIf you\'ve acted earlier, and have the cover now, you would have\nstopped worrying.\n\n\nAbout accidents, about the money, about your family\'s future.\n\n\nYou would have peace of mind.\n\n\nHowever, it\'s still not too late.\n\n\nWe\'ve enclosed an extra enrolment form here.\n\n\nWhy not take a few minutes now to fill and post it in?\n\n\nYour coverage begins immediately once your correctly completed form\nis received by the Insurance Company of North America.\n\n\nIt\'s a pleasure serving you.\n\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\nJacqueline Kuah ( Ms)\n\n\nSenior

{'text': '1) INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE \n\n\n" Ninety per cent of all millionaires became so through owning real\nestate".\n\n\nAndrew Carnegie A Guarantee for Capital Growth and a Hedge against\nInflation Many people have made their fortunes through investments in real\nestate which produces rental income as well as capital gains.\n\n\nLand is scarce in Singapore and it is becoming increasingly difficult\nto find affordable land for private housing development.\n\n\nSingapore has developed into a modern cosmopolitan state with many\nmulti-national corporations setting their bases or offices here, the value of\nresidential, commercial and industrial real estate must naturally rise with\nthe growth of the state and the passage of time.\n\n\nOfficial statistics confirm this.\n\n\nDemand for land in Singapore will always exceed supply.\n\n\nLand cannot be manufactured as cars can.\n\n\nMoreover, the costs of construction and labour are always on the rise.\n\n\nThese factors contribute towards the certain increase in the value of\nreal estate.\n\n\nOnly political instability and internal strife or world wide economic\ndepression can disrupt the upward trend.\n\n\nAs Singapore advances into the twenty-first century, property\ninvestment is a preferred investment.\n\n\nAn Economics teacher, who migrated from China to Singapore about\nthirty years ago, now owns three houses.\n\n\nHe lives in comfortable retirement.\n\n\nHe once said that the secret of his retirement plan lay in real\nestate.\n\n\nAll his savings went into property which he bought during his working\nlife.\n\n\nThe value of his property had increased more than 20 times its\noriginal value.\n\n\nHis words of wisdom were: " The value of property must go up as a\nmatter of course as the country develops into a modern state.\n\n\nIt is not luck.\n\n\nIt is certainty".\n\n\nNo Capital Gains Tax in Singapore Makes Real Estate an Attractive\nInvestment.\n\n\nThere is no capital gains tax in Singapore.\n\n\nLet us hope it stays that way.\n\n\nCapital gains tax is the tax charged in respect of gains accruing to\na person on the disposal of his capital assets.\n\n\nThe term " assets" covers land or any interests in land.\n\n\nSo, in countries like the United Kingdom and Australia, which levy\ncapital gains tax, any person who disposes of his real estate by sales,\nexchanges of property or any other dealings is liable to pay tax on his\ngains.\n\n\nThis is not so in Singapore.\n\n\nIf you sell your residence and make a huge gain you do not pay any\nextra tax.\n\n\nYou keep all the profits.\n\n\nA person is liable to pay tax on the profits on real estate\ntransactions only if the taxman considers that such profits are his income\nand hence subject to taxation under the income tax law.\n\n\nEstate agents and property investment companies earn their income by\nmaking property deals and so are liable to pay income tax on their\ncommissions or profits.\n\n\nThe sale of property is their trade, occupation, profession or\nbusiness.\n\n\nPeople who speculate in property, or those who buy and resell so\nfrequently that the taxman considers their activities amount to their trade,\noccupation, profession or business, are required to pay income tax on the\nprofits made according to the income tax scale.\n\n\n" Negative Gearing" - a Sound Investment Idea.\n\n\nInvestment in property can become a useful strategy for reducing your\ntax bill.\n\n\nIt works like this: if you borrow money to purchase a property for\ninvestment, and the rent or income generated by the property is not\nsufficient to cover the loan and interest, and other outgoings, the money you\nuse to pay the loan and interest plus all expenses incurred for the\nmaintenance of the property can be used for tax deduction.\n\n\nIn other words, " gearing" means borrowing and when the cash flow is\nnegative ( more expenses than income), the situation is described as "\nnegatively geared".\n\n\nYou might ask why anyone would want an investment which costs him\nmoney.\n\n\nProperty investment is a medium- or long-term investment, made by an\ninvestor who is not concerned with immediate income.\n\n\nHe is usually more concerned with the capital gains of the property,\nso that when he eventually sells his property, he will recoup all the\nexpenses incurred and at the same time reap a huge profit, free from capital\ngains tax or income tax.\n\n\nIn other words, he holds on to the property longer in the hope of\nbigger gains.\n\n\nExemption of estate duty for one unit of residential property.\n\n\nWhere a person dies, his estate has to pay estate duty to the\ngovernment calculated according to the value of the estate at the time of his\ndeath.\n\n\nThe estate duty law however allows an exemption of estate duty for\none unit of residential property up to the extent of\n&dollar;3 million, whether occupied by the deceased or not, and up to\n&dollar;500,000 for any other property ( Section 14(3) estate Duty Act).\n\n\nThis is a favourable factor for investment in a residential property.\n\n\n Investing Your PF Savings in Real Estate. \n\n\nThe law now allows all members of the Central Provident Fund Board to\nuse their CPF savings to repay housing loans, and to purchase property and\nsome authorized shares and stocks.\n\n\nTake advantage of this law.\n\n\nInvest your CPF savings in property.\n\n\nA member who has used his CPF savings to purchase a property which he\nsubsequently resells at a profit, can keep all the profits after re-\ncrediting into his account the amount of CPF savings ( plus accrued interest)\nwhich was withdrawn for the purchase.\n\n\nBut a member who has used his CPF savings to buy stocks and shares\nwhich he later resells at a profit is obliged to recredit the entire sale\nproceeds into his account.\n\n\nThis makes the use of CPF savings to purchase a property preferable\nto its use for buying stocks and shares.\n\n\n Purchasing a House or Apartment. \n\n\nLocation.\n\n\nWhen a person purchases a house or apartment, he is actually putting\nhis savings into a property which will grow in value.\n\n\nThe purchasing power of money decreases with the passing of years\nbecause of inflation and depression.\n\n\nIn choosing a property for investment, the golden rule is: "\nLocation, location, location".\n\n\nLook for easy access to the central business district, proximity to\nfacilities such as the Mass Rapid Transit System, schools, markets,\ndepartment stores, and all those amenities which provide a person with the\ncomforts of life.\n\n\nAvoid property which is in front of, or adjacent to, a graveyard.\n\n\nYou may not mind, but many other prospective buyers will, which may\nmake reselling the property more difficult for you.\n\n\nRefrain from investing in a property at a junction.\n\n\nMany local people consider this an unlucky location because it\noffends the " nameless ones" ( ie the spirits) and so the property does not\nusually have a high resale value.\n\n\nAvoid property which is situated along a main road or noisy\nthoroughfare, or property that is on the way to or from a congested traffic\narea.\n\n\nBe realistic rather than emotional when making a decision about\npurchasing a property.\n\n\nIt is not like buying a bouquet of flowers which can be replaced from\ntime to time at low cost.\n\n\n The importance of good timing. \n\n\nThe ideal course of action is to buy in gloom, and sell in boom.\n\n\nBut most of us are unable to predict times of gloom and boom.\n\n\nThe risks are there.\n\n\nWithin human limitation, the task is to match-make the timing of\ninvestment with the development of the property market.\n\n\nSuccess or failure in property investment depends on the timing which\nis particularly critical when purchasing or development costs soar.\n\n\nI have seen some developers lose heavily because of their poor\ntiming.\n\n\nOne example is when the land was acquired during a boom, and the\nbuilding of the houses was started just after the boom was over.\n\n\nThe houses were only ready for sale and occupation when the recession\nwas at its worst.\n\n\nVillagers camped in the row of empty houses causing considerable\ndamage, and the developers had to pay for further repair costs in order to\ntry to sell them in a depressed market.\n\n\nI have also seen other developers who were so fortunate in their\ntiming that their apartments sold so well that they even profited from their\nlevy of charges on a chain of subpurchasers of the same property each time\nthey asked for a fresh developer\'s contract.\n\n\nFrom the experience of many property investors, it appears that\nexcessive caution can be as financially catastrophic as being optimism.\n\n\n Viewing a house or apartment. \n\n\nOne must always view the property to be invested in.\n\n\nOne viewing is not enough.\n\n\nGo back again and take a second look.\n\n\nDrive around the area in which the property is situated at different\ntimes of the day and at night.\n\n\nSee what kind of neighbours you are going to have.\n\n\nObserve the environment.\n\n\nIs there a rubber factory nearby which emits an unpleasant odour\nevery other day?\n\n\nCheck the direction of the setting sun in relation to your house -\nwill you be returning each evening to a home as warm as an oven?\n\n\nIs there any noise pollution or disturbance from a nearby power\nstation?\n\n\nSince this property is the place where you are going to live, make\nsure that you and your family like it.\n\n\nIf you are accompanied by the vendor\'s agent, do not be too easily\npersuaded by him into buying.\n\n\nDo not be intimidated by his advances.\n\n\nHold your ground.\n\n\nYou owe him nothing.\n\n\nCome back again without the agent before you decide to buy.\n\n\nYou should not then blame the agent if after the contract you regret\nthe decision.\n\n\nBy all means, listen to the agent but remember that he is there, at\nhis own expense, to tell you about the best features of the property in order\nto get you to purchase it.\n\n\nIn so doing, he will earn his commission to cover his expenses and\ncost of living.\n\n\nHe is not there to advise you not to buy the property because there\nare defects in the house or other unpleasant factors.\n\n\nHe does not make his living that way.\n\n\nYou are the one who will buy the property, so you must decide.\n\n\nDo not let the agent decide for you.\n\n\nIt is a good idea to engage a surveyor or valuer to advise you on\nthe state and condition of the property and on its value, before you enter\ninto a contract to purchase.\n\n\nThey are professional people competent to advise you.\n\n\nThey owe a duty of care in writing a valuation report, and can be\nsued for negligence if the report is proven wrong.\n\n\nA valuer\'s report will enable you to make the purchase with greater\npeace of mind.\n\n\nSometimes market conditions can be such that a vendor will not wait\nfor you to make a decision after you have read a surveyor\'s or valuer\'s\nreport.\n\n\nIn a rapidly rising market, some vendors do not even consider\ngranting access to their property to an interested purchaser\'s surveyor or\nvaluer to enable him to write his report.\n\n\nTheir attitude can be blunt: take it or leave it.\n\n\nNo vendor likes hassles.\n\n\nHe will sell his property to the person offering the highest price,\nand if he offers the price without a valuation report, it is not the vendor\'s\nconcern.\n\n\nIt is usually the case that, after contract, a valuation is prepared\nby the surveyor or valuer of the bank or the Central Provident Fund Board\nproviding or releasing the finance for the purchase.\n\n\nThe bank or CPF Board relies on the valuer\'s report to determine the\namount to lend or the amount of CPF savings which may be withdrawn.\n\n\n Modify Your Lifestyle to Suit Your Means \n\n\nThe dream of most young people is to own a semi-detached or\ndetached bungalow.\n\n\nThis dream, however, is out of reach for most young people new to\nthe workforce.\n\n\nRather than pouring rent money down the drain, it is recommended\nthat they buy something smaller such as a unit in a condominium, a townhouse\nor a terrace house.\n\n\nAs long as they can get started, they stand a chance of owning\nsomething bigger in the long run. \n\n\nIt is a matter of adjusting one\'s thinking to one\'s situation.\n\n\nIf one over-commits himself, one can get into all sorts of\ndifficulties.\n\n\nInsufficient money has proven to be the root of many evils.\n\n\nTherefore, modify your lifestyle to suit your savings and buy an\naffordable property.\n\n\nThis will give you a foothold in the ever-spiralling property\nmarket.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'Controversial Issues In Curriculum Development \n\n\nBy Gan Cheong Eng\n\n\n Background \n\n\nThe proliferation of short and long courses in management studies has\nnot only made difficult the choice of a right course by students, but also\nthe task of distinguishing a unique course by administrators and teachers.\n\n\nIn the flood of courses with overlapping curricula and syllabuses, one\nwould be hard put to find anything new, and yet relevant, among the safe and\nwell trodden areas of basic and general principles and practices.\n\n\nIt is time for courses to introduce controversial issues in management\nstudies.\n\n\nA controversial issue covers new grounds.\n\n\nIt enhances the learning process.\n\n\nIt could facilitate further the practice of examining, analyzing and\ndeciding skills.\n\n\nHowever, if not carefully introduced, controversial issues could\ngenerate a disproportionate degree of confusion, and result in demotivating\nthe students.\n\n\nAs such, the introduction of a controversial issue in the curriculum\nwould have to be properly managed because a controversial issue could be\neither a good or bad teacher by affecting learning through its contents or\nthrough its dynamics.\n\n\n Aims \n\n\nThe first part of this paper is to identify a controversial issue and\nexplain why it is controversial.\n\n\nThe second part of this paper is to relate a plan of action and show\nhow the introduction of a controversial issue should be implemented.\n\n\nA case is used to illustrate the process of introducing a\ncontroversial issue into the curriculum.\n\n\n Definition \n\n\nThe term curriculum has ranges of meanings.\n\n\nIt is therefore necessary at the outset of this paper to define the\nscope of this term used in this discussion.\n\n\nThis is to prevent the discussion from being distracted and confused\nby the various interpretations of this term.\n\n\nSimilarly, what controversy is, in itself, controversial.\n\n\nIt is therefore important also at this outset, to have a workable\ndefinition of the term \'controversial\', in order to be able to evaluate and\nqualify a proposed issue to be considered as a controversial issue for\ndiscussion.\n\n\n Curriculum \n\n\nBroadly, curriculum could mean the overall education programme of an\ninstitution and it embraces individual subject areas.\n\n\nNarrowly, it has been equated with a syllabus of a subject and it\ncontains a set of transmittable knowledge.\n\n\nSome educationalists prefer to confine curriculum to only those overt\nactivities which are planned and organized intentionally by administrators\nand teachers for the students.\n\n\nOthers speak of the curriculum to include even things which are not\novertly included in the planning or organizing of learning arrangements but\nare learnt by students.\n\n\nThere is also the distinction made between the \'official\' curriculum\nand the \'actual\' curriculum.\n\n\nThe official curriculum being what is laid down in theory in the form\nof prospectus, syllabus, and like documentation; and the actual curriculum\nbeing what is covered in practice.\n\n\nA full definition of the curriculum would be one covering all the\nabove views.\n\n\nIt would be a curriculum embracing all the purposes, principles and\nprocedures of the whole education system, ranging from national institutional\npolicies to individual subject syllabus, and consisting of all deliberate and\nincidental activities.\n\n\nIf one attempts to use such a global definition of the curriculum in\nthis paper, it would be too wide a scope for this limited discussion.\n\n\nYet to reduce the definition to anything lesser for the purpose of\nthis paper, would mean the exclusion of some related areas of consideration\nand working in a vacuum to some extent.\n\n\nThe compromise would have to be concentration on the more obvious\nareas while bearing in mind all the others.\n\n\nThis paper would therefore discuss more on the official curriculum\nand deliberate activities of a particular subject of a long course, or in the\nform of a single short course.\n\n\n Controversial Issue \n\n\nSeveral important views about the definition of a controversial issue\nhave been written.\n\n\nThey focus on three areas of consideration and could be summarized to\nbe the basic requirements for an issue to be considered, and to qualify as a\ncontroversial issue for the curriculum.\n\n\nThe three requirements are:\n\n\na) A controversial issue would be one, which is considered to be\nimportant by an appreciable number of people.\n\n\nb) A controversial issue would divide, be they students, teachers,\nadministrators or even parents.\n\n\nc) A controversial issue would involve value judgement, which\nprevents the issue from being settled by facts, empirical evidence\nexperimental results.\n\n\nIn the above order, these three requirements would be used to\nevaluate whether a proposed issue could count as a controversial issue for\nthe curriculum.\n\n\n Proposed Issue \n\n\nThe case cited is about the introduction of a series of talks into a\npart-time professional course conducted by a private institute.\n\n\nIn early 1990, the Executive Director informed the affected Unit that\n" in response to the emphasis on professionalism, the President met with the\nUnit Leaders on a number of occasions to discuss with them the ways of\ndeveloping the correct conduct for students to carry with them after\ngraduation, so that they may display professionalism in their practices.\n\n\nWith the help of the Unit on Special Studies, a Talk Series on\nEthical practices has been developed for all students in your Unit.\n\n\nThe President has proposed that the Series be given initially to\nPart-time students.\n\n\nThey would be taught during the first 10 weeks of Semester 1 as part\nof the subject on Business Management in the Professional Course.\n\n\nThe action of the Unit is to introduce the Series on Ethical\nPractices, beginning in the new year".\n\n\nThis issue could also be identified to be a controversial issue\nbecause:\n\n\n1) It affects an appreciable number of people, particularly the\nstudents taking the affected subject, not to mention the teachers and\nadministrators involved in this subject.\n\n\n2) It divides the students, teachers and administrators, particularly\non the selection of different courses for implementation.\n\n\n3) It involves value judgment, particularly as to whether only the\nUnit on Special Studies could point the ways of developing the correct\nconduct for students to carry with them after graduation, so that they may\ndisplay professionalism in their practices.\n\n\nPlan of Action\n\n\nWith reference to the meetings of the President and the Unit Leaders\nmentioned in the Executive Director\'s circular, one would gather that a\nsocial change is required.\n\n\nTo provide for this kind of changes, education must change in order\nto keep pace.\n\n\nIn the same circular, one could also conclude that the meetings of\nthe President and Unit Leaders recognized the need for an innovative change\nin the professional education and saw that this educational change must be\ndeliberately managed rather than be merely left to happen.\n\n\nThus with the help of the Unit on Special Studies, a Talk Series on\nEthical Practices had been developed for all students in the affected Unit.\n\n\nFor the affected Unit, it would be taught to Part-time students as\npart of the subject on Business Management in the Professional Course.\n\n\n Consideration \n\n\nThe birth of the Ethical Practices Series which was not left to\nchance but carefully thought out and deliberately executed, could be said to\nbe the results of evolutionary than revolutionary curriculum planning.\n\n\nThe syllabus of the Series was completed quicker than the normal\ngestation period.\n\n\nThe top down imposition of the Series smoothened an otherwise rough\npassage of acceptance and implementation in normal courses.\n\n\nThe whole exercise seemed to be completed quite efficiently.\n\n\nIn the implementation of the directive of the Executive Director,the\ncurriculum planners in the affected Unit, i.e. staff responsible for\ncurriculum improvement, were concerned about the basis on which the Ethical\nPractices Series could be built into the Business Management Subject.\n\n\nThey knew that the curriculum of a course should and had been planned\nas a whole.\n\n\nBeing multidisciplinary as required by the profession, the\nProfessional Course is a purposeful arrangement of integrated subjects and\nnot a simple collection of separate subjects.\n\n\nTheir task was to dovetail the series on Ethical Practices in a\ncomplementary manner rather than attach it in a rather piecemeal way into the\nsubject on Business Management.\n\n\nThis was to preserve the overall rationale of the whole course\ncurriculum.\n\n\nCare was therefore exercised, even to the extent of comparing topic\nby topic of the syllabus contents of the proposed series with the ongoing\nsubject, in order to firstly avoid the duplication of topics, and secondly to\npreserve the connection between and among topics.\n\n\nIn the implementation of this directive, the subject teachers in the\naffected Unit ie both the teachers and the assistants, were concerned about\nthe effects of the different management and even teaching approaches adopted\nby the series and the subject.\n\n\nThe series was set in the contingent approach for management while\nthe subject was anchored on the scientific or production approach for\nmanagement.\n\n\nClearly in the consciousness of the teachers were what students would\nlearn from the hidden curriculum even though they would not ( be) overtly\nrecognized by the students themselves.\n\n\nWhile they accepted that the values and attitudes learnt as by\nproducts of another approach would be additional and good, they were aware\nthat there would be contradictions arising from the different approaches.\n\n\nThey would find it hard to accept responsibilities in what their\nstudents would learn in the unplanned way what would be going on in the \'external\'\nseries.\n\n\n Models \n\n\nThe comparative analysis of the syllabuses of the series and the\nsubject follows the simple linear model of distinguishing what to achieve (\nobjectives), what to cover ( contents), what to do ( methods), and what to\ncontrol ( evaluations).\n\n\nThe monitoring cum control of the effects of covert learning uses a\ncyclical model in which the results of an evaluation process of the series by\nstudents the teaching and learning, would help to fine tune the fit between\nthe series and the subject.\n\n\nThus, a combination of an objective albeit linear, model; and a\nprocess, using a cyclical and continuous model, was used for implementing the\ndirective to introduce the series into the subject.\n\n\n Problem in Operation \n\n\n 1 Pressures \n\n\nFull cognizance should be given to the influences on the curriculum\nplanner for they could suppress the controversial issue.\n\n\nAt the national and industry level, the influences on curriculum\nwould be economic, social and sometimes political.\n\n\nThe economic function of the education system in building up national\nwealth could not be ignored.\n\n\nSociety also expects some returns from education on which it has\nsupported.\n\n\nPolitical influence on the curriculum could be quite direct with\ncentral decisions on curriculum content and method, leaving little discretion\nto the institutions.\n\n\nAs the provider, the market have to be satisfied that education is\nfulfilling its main economic and social roles and if not, may decide to\neffect necessary changes in education to ensure compliance.\n\n\nAt the institutional level, the larger concern of the institute and\nits management would be on organization and administration.\n\n\nHowever, curriculum issues cannot be completely ignored because\nfailure to achieve some understanding of these issues will vitiate any\nrecommendations made.\n\n\nIn the case of the Series on Ethical Practices, the meetings of\nPresident and Unit Leaders was more precise on operational matters than\ncurriculum issues.\n\n\nThe top-down imposition of the series by the President on the\naffected Unit left the Unit\'s Leader, curriculum planners and the subject\nteachers, no choices but reluctant acceptance.\n\n\n 2 Responses \n\n\nWithout allowing much debate and particularly response from the\nground, the straight-down introduction of the series into subjects started\noff the controversies.\n\n\nAt the Unit level, sufficient influence to effect what can and cannot\nbe attempted, implemented and achieved in the proposed curriculum development\ncould still be wielded by the internal administration led by the Leader and\nadministrators through the administrative structures and powers.\n\n\nAt the classroom level, the influence of tradition in either the\nteaching or the teacher could still be used to hinder and obstruct the\nproposed curriculum change.\n\n\nThey include certain teachings like approaches and contents which\nbecome so enshrined in respectability and attain such unquestioned\nacceptability that they appear to form a compulsory tradition in certain\neducation.\n\n\nSimilarly, teachers could still cling to those forms of practice in\nwhich they were trained in or practiced for years and thus have come to feel\nconfident in and at home with them. \n\n\nThe bottom-up resistance showed up in the operation of the revised\ncurriculum.\n\n\nIn name, the planners and teachers toed the line.\n\n\nHowever, the enthusiasm and activity that should accompany any new\nor revised curriculum are obviously absent in this case of the Ethical\nPractices Series in the Business Management Subject.\n\n\nThere were administrative conflicts between the Unit on Special\nStudies and the affected Unit due to different organizational structures and\nadministration practices.\n\n\nThere were also academic competition between teachers of the\nEthical Practices Series and the Business Management Subject due to different\nacademic traditions and professional training.\n\n\n3 Compromises In curriculum development and implementation,\nexternal parties are explicitly employed to disseminate experience and ideas,\nand advise on the necessary changes when considering overt attempts to\ncontribute to curriculum development.\n\n\nAn inspectorate plays this role at both central and local levels.\n\n\nIn this case of the controversial issue of introducing the series\ninto the subject, the Unit on Special Studies could have been acting in the\ninspectorate role and playing a mediatory function.\n\n\nHowever, due to its direct participation in teaching the series,\nthe Unit on Special Studies was perceived as the main beneficiary of the\ncontroversial issue by the affected parties and lost the opportunity to be\nable to ease the series into the subject.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '61c6ec69-f81b-4966-9b4c-e113cb36b143', 'added':

{'text': 'Contractual arrangements and communications in construction:\n\n\nA Hypothetical Framework For Further Research\n\n\nDr Low Sui Pheng\n\n\nSchool of Building and Estate Management National University of\nSingapore.\n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n\nThe level of communications likely to be adopted by different\noperating units within the construction procurement system can be looked at\nthrough the linkages that exist between different operating units for any one\nproject.\n\n\nThese linkages, which also determine the relationship between units,\nappear to be dependent on the contractual arrangements adopted.\n\n\nThe evolution of different contractual arrangements have been\nnoticeable in recent years in the construction industry.\n\n\nNumerous works pertaining to alternative modes of procurement have\nbeen published, drawing attention to the wide range of possible tendering\nprocedures and contractual arrangements which can be adopted in the industry.\n\n\nThe traditional mode of procurement was believed to be appropriate\nonly for the relatively simple construction of the past.\n\n\nWith the advent of new technologies, new requirements, increasingly\nsophisticated organisational structures and growing magnitude and size of\nprojects, the traditional mode is now considered lacking to cope with the\nmultiplicity of problems inherent of such a scenario.\n\n\nThis has given rise to other alternative arrangements.\n\n\nFrom both the contractual and technical point of view, conventional\nrisks in construction are implicitly linked to the criteria of time, cost and\nquality when agreed and specified requirements are not fulfilled.\n\n\nThese, in effect, sum up succinctly the background for articulating\nwho and what is at risk.\n\n\nBecause this paradigm has been dealt with frequently and extolled by\nothers elsewhere, it is not the intention here to partake in this debate\nfurther from this familiar perspective.\n\n\nThis paper essentially seeks to examine the communication risks\nbetween different types of contractual arrangements in construction and, in\nthe process, hypothesize the various scenarios which may occur.\n\n\nCommunication risks in the context of this paper refer to the\nprobability of a breakdown in communication between parties to a contractual\narrangement.\n\n\nIt would appear that the more communication channels which a party to\na contractual arrangement is subject to, then correspondingly, the associated\ncommunication risks will also become higher.\n\n\n CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS \n\n\nIt is, however, not the objective of this paper to discuss in details\nthe different types of contractual arrangements adopted by the construction\nindustry suffice to say that these have seemed to develop as a result of\nincreasing clients\' demands.\n\n\nFriedman ( 1984), for example, appears to suggest that the evolution\nof different contract strategies are fundamentally modifications made in the\nmarketing direction to suit the clients\' requirements.\n\n\nIn contrast, from a more conventional perspective, Smith ( 1984) has\nexpounded on the time, cost and performance requirements of the client where\nconsiderable emphasis was placed on the quality, flexibility, adaptability\nand functional aspects of the structure under consideration.\n\n\nThe development of alternative contract strategies, which seems to\nhave led to a consequential erosion of the traditional mode of procurement,\nrevolves around a desire to both integrate thedesign and construction\nprocesses and to shorten the duration required for actual construction.\n\n\nBecause of the division between design and construction, critics have\ndismissed the traditional mode for its lack of efficiency.\n\n\nContractors, it has frequently been argued, should have a more active\nrole to play during the design phase of a project.\n\n\nInputs of construction expertise to the designers\' proposals at this\nstage would serve to avoid or reduce any unorthodox practices which do not\nmatch the clients\' objectives in achieving value for money.\n\n\nThe separation of design from construction would mean that the\ndesigners are not avail of the opportunity to benefit from the contractors\'\nexpertise.\n\n\nWithout such a knowledge, it would be more difficult to synchronise\nappropriate design schemes with the contractors\' abilities and available\nresources.\n\n\nContemporary contractual arrangements therefore seek to bridge the\ngap between design and construction.\n\n\nContractual arrangements which are commonly adopted in the\nconstruction industry are depicted in Figures 1 to 5.\n\n\nThe construction system is now disaggregated into five different\nmodes of procurement, each of which will be considered shortly.\n\n\nThese are:\n\n\n1) The traditional contract arrangement.\n\n\n2) Design and build contract.\n\n\n3) Construction management approach.\n\n\n4) Project management approach, and\n\n\n5) Management contracting.\n\n\nTo achieve hypothetical simplicity for examining communication risks,\nother procurement methods suggested by Masterman ( 1988) such as the Design\nand management contract, Package deal, Turnkey contract and the British\nProperty Federation ( BPF) system will not be considered in this paper.\n\n\nAn attempt will be made in each of these five strategic types to show\nthe conceptual relationships between the different operating units in\ncommunication terms.\n\n\nOperating units are used here to denote the individuals or\norganizations who participate in any one contractual arrangement.\n\n\nFor clarity, the operating units in Figures 1 to 5 is hierarchically\nstructured to show the flow of communication.\n\n\nThe number of operating units is only indicative of what may actually\nbe encountered in real life.\n\n\nHence, while the label " consultant" includes the various independent\nprofessions within the construction industry, other operating units such as\nnominated and domestic suppliers will be annotated under the heading of "\nsupplier".\n\n\nLikewise, nominated, domestic and labouronly subcontractors as well\nas plant hiring firms were generally included under the heading of "\nsubcontractor".\n\n\nRegulatory and other government agencies acting on behalf of the\nauthorities are not included in this hypothetical treatise.\n\n\nSeveral other assumptions are also made in this hypothetical approach\nto conceptualising communication flows for the construction industry.\n\n\nFirstly, for the reason of clarity mentioned above, each operating\nunit is considered within the context of only one individual contract.\n\n\nThis may not always be the case in practice as parties frequently\nfind themselves operating spontaneously in several projects all at the same\ntime.\n\n\nSecondly, the client is explored in this paper as a single entity\nwithout any supporting specialisms from within.\n\n\nClients are therefore assumed to be less than knowledgeable and have\nto rely on outside consultants for advice to safeguard their interests.\n\n\nA growing number of well-informed clients, particularly the larger\nones and most public sector organizations, however, do have their own\nin-house professional employees with comparable, if not better, expertise\nthan the external consultants.\n\n\nClients\' in-house staff are therefore not considered here as well.\n\n\nLastly, by referring strictly only to operating units within each\ncontractual arrangement, organisations outside of the contract proper in each\nhierarchical framework shown in Figures 1 to 5 are also excluded.\n\n\nThe client, especially one in the private sector, is assumed to have\nthe requisite financial resources to fund a project.\n\n\nThis may not always be the case in practice because there are always\ninstances where funds are engineered from some other sources such as banks\nand in the case of construction in the less developed countries,\ninternational lending agencies such as the Asian Development Bank and the\nWorld Bank.\n\n\nThe client\'s position in each mode of procurement may not therefore\nbe absolute in that sense.\n\n\nSome situations will always remain where the clients, consultants and\ncontractors alike need to market the feasibility and viability of their\nrespective undertakings to yet other organisations outside the institutional\nframeworks considered in this paper.\n\n\n INTERPRETATIONS  The structural relationships of each of the\nprocurement modes shown in Figures 1 to 5 are quantified in Tables 1 to 5\nrespectively.\n\n\nThis crude quantification process is carried out simply by physically\ncounting the number of communication flows directed towards ( ie inflows) and\naway ( ie outflows) from each operating unit.\n\n\nThe primary and secondary communication flows are indicated in\nFigures 1 to 5 using normal arrowed lines and broken arrowed lines\nrespectively.\n\n\nThe orgnisational hierarchy between various operating units, as\ndetermined by their economic and occupational orders, is also shown.\n\n\nIn the context of this paper, primary communication flows are defined\nas first-order priority activities directed by one operating unit towards\nanother to achieve set marketing objectives.\n\n\nSecondary communication flows, on the other hand, are defined as\nsecond-order priority activities directed by one operating unit towards\nanother to achieve set marketing objectives.\n\n\nFirst-order priority activities are marketing activities which are\nmore concentrated, rigorous and intense than second-order priority\nactivities.\n\n\nThe former is therefore aimed at prospective clients who have direct\nand substantial influence over purchasing decisions.\n\n\nAs a result, it would not be unreasonable to expect the flow of\nmarketing efforts to be primarily from vendors to buyers, the intensity of\nwhich is dependent on the authority a prospective buyer commands and exerts\nin making purchasing decisions.\n\n\nMarketing intensities therefore describe the spectrum of activities\nthat lies between the first-order and second-order priorities.\n\n\nNevertheless, it should be noted that a high degree of subjectivity\nwill inevitably be invoked if marketing intensities were to be determined and\nmeasured.\n\n\n THE TRADITIONAL ARRANGEMENT \n\n\nThe client, consultant, main contractor, subcontractor and supplier\nare the operating units considered in this arrangement.\n\n\nAs noted above, the communication flows were directed expectedly from\nsellers to buyers of products and services as shown in figure 1.\n\n\nBecause the supplier is predominately concerned with marketing his\nproducts to the consultant, main contractor and subcontractor, there is an\nintense flow of primary communication in this direction.\n\n\nOn the other hand, secondary marketing efforts are also directed from\nthe supplier to the client who nevertheless retains an influence over the\nselection and purchase of the supplier\'s product offerings.\n\n\nThe more pertinent observations which can be derived from this\nhypothetical scenario include the following: It may be unrealistic to assume\nthat marketing efforts flow only from sellers to buyers.\n\n\nCircumstances could arise where the reverse may also be true.\n\n\nThis would appear to be the case for both the main contractor and\nsubcontractor where secondary marketing efforts are channelled towards the\nsupplier for the purpose of securing extended credit terms.\n\n\nThis would, however, be unnecessary if the supplier operates in a\ncompetitive environment where attractive credit terms are adopted as a\nmarketing tool in a buyer\'s market.\n\n\nMarketing efforts may, therefore, follow a two-way flow.\n\n\nThese can either be inflows directed towards an operating unit or\noutflows directed away from an operating unit.\n\n\nThe higher an operating unit is within the contractual hierarchy, the\nmore marketing efforts are likely to be directed towards it.\n\n\nThe client, as the supreme paymaster, will inevitably receive more\nprimary and secondary inflows of marketing efforts than other operating\nunits.\n\n\nTable 1 is an attempt to quantify the intensities of marketing flow\nefforts for the traditional contract arrangement.\n\n\nAs can be seen in Table 1, a systemic balance has been maintained for\nboth the inflows and outflows of both primary and secondary marketing\nefforts.\n\n\nA total of 24 communication flows was generated.\n\n\nHypothetically, these represent the communication channels through\nwhich products and services are marketed.\n\n\nIt would generally appear that the more channels there are, the\nhigher will be the risks of communication barriers or breakdowns and the\ngreater the influence these will have on the marketing of one\'s products and\nservices.\n\n\nThese general observations are also applicable for the other four\napproaches to project procurement.\n\n\n DESIGN AND BUILD CONTRACT  The operating units involved in\nthis approach are the client, main contractor, consultant, subcontractor and\nsupplier as shown in Figure 2, which is similar in many aspects to Figure 1\nexcept that the hierarchical roles of both the consultant and main contractor\nhave now been reversed to account for the integration of both design and\nconstruction.\n\n\nThe number of communication flows generated remain at 24 ( see Table\n2).\n\n\n CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT APPROACH \n\n\nThe client, consultant, construction manager, main contractor,\nsubcontractor and supplier are the operating units involved in this approach\nin Figure 3.\n\n\nThe marketing flows are now less refined than the two previous\narrangements.\n\n\nThis may be attributed to the additional role of the construction\nmanager who now coordinates construction and design activities.\n\n\nA reciprocal flow of secondary marketing efforts between the\nconstruction manager and the consultant is therefore inevitable.\n\n\nThe number of marketing flow activities has now increased to 36 ( see\nTable 3), an increase of 50% over the preceding two contractual arrangements.\n\n\nAn increase in the number of operating units within any procurement\nsystems would therefore lead to a spontaneous increase in the overall level\nof marketing activities and communication flows. \n\n\n PROJECT MANAGEMENT APPROACH \n\n\nThe project management approach comprises of the client, project\nmanager, consultant, main contractor, subcontractor and supplier.\n\n\nThe number of operating units involved is similar to the\nconstruction management approach and remains at 6 ( see Figure 4).\n\n\nSimilarly, the number of marketing flow activities remains\nunchanged at 36 ( see Table 4), again an increase of 50% over both the\ntraditional as well as design and build arrangements.\n\n\nThe reciprocal flow of secondary marketing efforts now prevails\nbetween the consultant and the main contractor.\n\n\n MANAGEMENT CONTRACTING \n\n\nThis procurement mode involves the client, consultant, management\ncontractor, subcontractor and supplier ( see Figure 5).\n\n\nThe management contractor, in contrast to the main contractor under\nthe traditional arrangement, now coordinates construction works with design\nactivities.\n\n\nIn their respective roles, there is now a reciprocal flow of\nsecondary marketing efforts between the management contractor and the\nconsultant.\n\n\nAs indicated in table 5, the number of communication flows is now\n26.\n\n\nThis represents an increase of about 8% over both the traditional\nand design and build arrangements, but yields a reduction of nearly 40% over\nboth the construction management and project management approaches.\n\n\nBased on these hypothetical measurements, management contracting\nwhich generates 26 marketing flow activities appears to strike a balance\nbetween the two extremes which display a low scale of 24 and a high scale of\n36 respectively.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '96307d22-72e0-4190-b6e7-7f897b7e8f0b', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.688826+00:00', 'english_score': 0.956927478313446,

{'text': "Impersonalism, Goals and Sensitivity in Ethics: Contrasts from\nMiddlemarch \n\n\nChong Kim Chong\n\n\nContemporary Kantian and Utilitarian attempts to convict someone of\nirrationality, in willfully ignoring the interests of others, constitute, at\nthe same time, an attempt to give an account of the reason or reasons which\nanyone necessarily has, as a rational being, to be responsive to the\ninterests and needs of others.\n\n\nThese are reasons which, though not manifestly present in all cases,\nare said to form the underlying basis of any concern which we may show\ntowards our fellow beings.\n\n\nSeen from another perspective, the universalisability criterion is not\nmerely a tool to be used in moral argument, but defines moral reason - any\nmoral reason - as being grounded on rational and universal principle.\n\n\nFor reasons which shall become clearer, I shall label this description\nof the moral point of view 'impersonalism'.\n\n\nIt implies as just said, that any moral reason, properly called, is\nalways based, implicitly if not explicitly, on a principle or principles, or\nthat the reason must at least be subsumable under a universal principle.\n\n\nEven if one claims that one's reason for action is not appropriately\ndescribed as being based on a universal principle, the claim of impersonalism\nis that one is committed, by virtue of one's reason being called a moral\nreason, to universalising the reason.\n\n\nI argue, through a description of the moral development of Dorothea,\nin Middlemarch, that there is a kind of concern which one is never under any\nobligation to show, and such that one could never be committed to say, 'Anyone\n( similarly placed) ought to act under it ( or that it would be wrong not\nto)'.\n\n\nIt would not only be inappropriate, but mistaken, to try to justify\nsuch concern with a principle which universalizes one's reason for action,\nexpressing the kind of concern described.\n\n\nThe contrasting example of Rosamond shows how the structure of her (\nRosamond's) egoistic action is impersonally based.\n\n\nA reason which is impersonally grounded, as being based on principle,\nwhether egoistic or non-egoistic, if applied in certain contexts of personal\nrelationship, offends against the sense of what is morally good, in these\ncontexts of personal relationship.\n\n\nThe key to an understanding of egoism lies in asking the question,\nwhat area of human sensitivity it offends against.\n\n\nImpersonalism, far from detecting what is morally offensive about\negoism, instead provides the grounds for legitimizing it.\n\n\nCentral to what I mean to say is a distinction which can be made, in\ncertain contexts of human relationship, between the personal and impersonal\npoints of view.\n\n\nIn the first section of this paper, I shall consider some\nhypothetical examples to bring out the distinction and also the significance\nof making it.\n\n\nThis stands in contrast to other contexts where no such distinction\ncan be made.\n\n\nThe resulting analysis will serve to illuminate the contrast which I\nshall draw later, between an example of egoism ( Rosamond) an example\nindicative of moral concern ( Dorothea).\n\n\n 1) Personal and Impersonal Points of View \n\n\nSuppose D is C's wife, and C sees his relationship with D in terms of\nthe duty which he has towards her and that what she does for him should be\nviewed similarly as a fulfillment of the duty which she has towards him, as a\nwife.\n\n\nThat means he sees D as occupying a role in relation to him which\nentitles both of them to certain rights, and binds them to certain\nresponsibilities, vis-a-vis one another.\n\n\nThis impersonal conception of his relationship with D may well be in\norder, from a third person perspective.\n\n\nIt is generally agreed, for example, that if a wife needs emotional\nsupport, it is the husband's duty to provide it.\n\n\nThis may be subsumed under the universal principle, 'All husbands\nought to give their wives emotional support ( at such times when they need\nit)'.\n\n\nit is of course rather peculiar to describe the case like this, for\nit is not as if the wife needs such support in the way she needs, say, goods\nof some kind, nor is it the case that she needs support or comfort from\nsomeone fitting the appellation of a husband.\n\n\nFor the nature of such support can only be manifested through, and be\nexpressive of, an intimately personal relationship between two individuals,\nin this case, C and D.\n\n\nBut this observation itself serves to emphasise the following point.\n\n\nIf C, in response to his wife's emotional needs, at the same time\ndoes or says anything to indicate that his action is determined by the\nthought of 'what is to be expected of a husband', or 'what is due to a wife',\nchances are that D would be hurt.\n\n\nWhat would soothe her is not the thought that he is responding\nbecause he is acting out his role as a husband, but the thought that his\naction in comforting her is a response to her need for him.\n\n\nC's response and general conception of his relation to D, on the\nother hand, as the bearer of certain rights in respect of holding a certain\nposition, or as manifesting certain characteristics which call for treatment\nof a certain sort, implies that he would treat D just as he would treat any\nother person in D's position, who so happens to have that same relation to\nhim.\n\n\nBut such an impersonal conception of the relationship, held by a\nparticipant in that relationship, does not presuppose that there is an\nexisting personal relationship in which there is care and concern, and\nneither is it conducive towards establishing one.\n\n\nWe may better appreciate why this is so, when we consider the\ncharacteristics of cases in which no essential difference of meaning exists\nbetween the personal and the impersonal points of view.\n\n\n( 1) A group of surgeons decide to operate on a patient who is\nstricken with cancer.\n\n\nHis estimated chances of recovery after the surgery are good, and\nthere are no major difficulties anticipated for the operation itself.\n\n\nThe surgeons have performed the same kind of operation before, and\nthis particular case presents no relevant difference to make them feel overly\nconcerned.\n\n\nThere are certain standard technical procedures to follow, the broad\naim being of course, the patient's recovery.\n\n\nThis is more immediately and specifically described as to trace the\ncancer, and to stop its growth.\n\n\nThis aim dictates the means to be taken, as given by the latest\nmedical knowledge.\n\n\nThe patient however, fails to get through the operation.\n\n\nAccording to an independent assessor, the surgeons were competent and\ntechnically speaking, the operation was a success, except that the patient's\nheart failed to function at a critical stage of the operation.\n\n\nThis unforeseen event is classified under the category of 'technical\nrisks', and the surgeons therefore, are free from blame.\n\n\nAccording to the standards and procedures set by the aim, they had\ndone their best.\n\n\nThis judgment is arrived at through an analysis of the steps taken to\nsecure the aim.\n\n\nThe impersonal judgment that they had done their best is no different\nfrom their own belief that this was the case.\n\n\nShould they have committed an error on the other hand, their judgment\n( should they make it) that 'We did our best,' would be converted by the\nanalysis made on an impersonal basis, that 'They did not do their best'.\n\n\nBut although these two statements are contradictory, they belong\nessentially to the same process of determination.\n\n\nThat is, the truth of the judgment may be determined according to the\nrequirements set by the aim.\n\n\nThe specific aim of stopping the disease gives a certain direction to\nthe means, and the notions of mistake and correctness may be determined\naccording to whether these directions were followed, and to what degree.\n\n\nNote the contrast with what it is possible to say about the\nwife-husband relationship.\n\n\nIf the husband, say, rushes home to comfort his wife because he\nthinks, 'she needs me', instead of conceiving it as 'what is expected of a\nhusband', he is not contradicting this latter conception.\n\n\nNot because they mean the same, nor does he deny that he has such a\nduty.\n\n\nRather, his action is not determined by, or grounded upon, any such\nconception and requirement, and there can be no contradiction where the\nlevels of determination are not the same.\n\n\nTo see this, suppose that through no fault of his, he arrives too\nlate and something has happened to his wife.\n\n\nLet's say he feels utterly distraught and blames himself for this.\n\n\nThis is contradicted by others, for objectively speaking, he had\nperformed his duty by doing the best he could in coming.\n\n\nHis statement, 'I am to blame', however, is not to be seen from this\nperspective of the failure to take the proper means towards fulfilling a\ngoal, because first of all, as we have just seen, there is no such failure.\n\n\nSecondly, and more important, his statement of blame expresses the\nsignificance of the relationship which he has with the individual who is his\nwife.\n\n\nIt is, among other things, an expression of the commitment which he\nhas towards her.\n\n\nThus, even though from the impersonal point of view, he is not to\nblame, his feeling that he is to blame indicates something about the meaning\nand significance of the relationship, and there is no contradiction here.\n\n\nWhere there is no possibility of contradiction, neither is there a\npossibility of concurrence.\n\n\nThe notion of 'blame' in this context, does not take its cue from\nsome external requirement or standard which would make it possible for\nsomeone, as a spectator, to agree with him that he is personally to blame.\n\n\nFor, given the personal dimension in which he utters it, to so agree\nwould be a most callous thing to say.\n\n\n( 2) The personal and impersonal distinction also has no essential\nrole to play, in an institutional context, as will be seen in the following\nhypothetical example.\n\n\nAn accused, A, comes before a judge, to be tried for a crime.\n\n\nThe judge, after listening to the evidence, which makes it plain that\nA is guilty of the crime, finds also that he is remorseful.\n\n\nFormally speaking, remorse is not a criterion for passing a more\nlenient sentence.\n\n\nA's case is, in all relevant respects, similar to others involving\nthe same offence.\n\n\nThe rules governing the judge's decisions are institutional ones, and\nhis role is itself an institutional role.\n\n\nSeeing himself as an impartial guardian of the law, he may rightly\nfeel that he ought not allow himself to be swayed by considerations which are\nformally deemed irrelevant to the institutional aim of maintaining law and\norder.\n\n\nThus, although he may personally think that justice would not really\nbe done, considering the fact that A is remorseful about his past action, he\nmay be forced, on institutional considerations, to sentence A, consistently\nwith other cases of a similar kind.\n\n\nSome of these considerations may be for instance, the possibility\nthat should he pass a more lenient sentence on A, it may not help to deter\nothers from committing crimes of a similar nature, and the fact that should\nhe allow A's remorse to be considered relevant in passing sentence, it would\nbe difficult not to allow remorse to count in many other cases, bringing with\nit the problem of deciding whether the remorse shown is spurious or not.\n\n\nOr A's crime may be of such a serious nature that should he allow\nremorse to influence his judgment, there will be censure both from the public\nand his colleagues.\n\n\nAs in our example of the surgeons above, the ( institutional) aim of\nmaintaining law and order, in this context, directs that certain\nconsiderations are relevant, and others irrelevant, in making a judgment.\n\n\nNo doubt in reality, judges are known to vary somewhat in the\njudgments they make, perhaps because eof personal idiosyncrasies, but also\nbecause the law does allow for personal discretion ( including the\nconsideration of remorse), in certain cases and within limits, in judgment.\n\n\nnevertheless, the whole point of calling the aim institutional, and\nthe judge's role institutional, is that the form of his relationship to the\ndefendant and other members of the court, is guided by formalities set in\naccordance with the law. \n\n\nThus, in passing judgment, it is not the judge personally as such,\nwho passes the judgment, but the judge, qua judge.\n\n\nSimilarly, it is not A personally that he is passing judgment on,\nbut A as 'someone; who committed a certain crime and who merits being dealt\nwith in a certain way.\n\n\nNo room exists therefore, in this context, for the kind of\ndistinction we have made in the wife-husband relationship.\n\n\nBut once again, it points significantly to the need for such a\ndistinction, in the latter kind of context.\n\n\nIt is said for instance of Casaubon, in Middlemarch, that for him, 'Marriage,\nlike erudition, nay, like authorship itself, was fated to become an outward\nrequirement, and Edward Casuabon was bent on fulfilling unimpeachably all\nrequirements.' In conceiving of his marriage, like everything else, as\nimposing certain external requirements, Casaubon sees it as an institution\nwhich he has joined, and whose membership requires that certain conditions be\nfulfilled.\n\n\nIf he does not fulfil them, then he is liable to reproach.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if he does his part and plays his role as a\nmember by doing what is required of him, he would be blameless and\nirreproachable.\n\n\nJust as the standards set up by the institution make one liable to\ncensure, these very same standards also protect one from censure.\n\n\nCasaubon's actions in this regard however, are the very expression\nof insensitivity, and this is what forms a barrier between him and his wife,\nDorothea.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '133723b9-acc0-4377-83a6-48c20725da86', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.690209+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9790015816688538, 'non_english_score': 0.02099841833114624}
{'text': 'A STUDY OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE MALAY LANGUAGE \n\n\n Social Change and Cognitive Development \n\n\nTHAM SEONG CHEE\n\n\n CHAPTER I \n\n\n LANGUAGE AS LINGUA MENTALIS \n\n\nAny attempt to study human phenomena ( whether they are of a\nlinguistic, psychological, sociological, political or cultural nature) is\nimmediately confronted by their tremendous variety.\n\n\nOver the years, the human or social sciences have attempted to use\nvarious theoretical-methodological approaches to make sense of this apparent\ndiversity.\n\n\nHow then should one deal with the countless variety of social,\ncultural, linguistic and political forms ( be they elements of thought,\naction or behaviour) manifested by different groups, communities or\nsocieties?\n\n\nWhat theoretical foundations might one construct to account for this\nvariety?\n\n\nAre there objective measures to determine their qualitative status\nvis-d-vis a given set of existential circumstances?\n\n\nIf so, how may such objective measures be constructed?\n\n\nTo complicate matters, approaches to the study and understanding of\nhuman phenomena are sometimes distorted by extraneous factors such as for\nexample political beliefs, ideology and sheer ethnocentrism.\n\n\nTo some extent, this is unavoidable because a scholar or researcher\ndoing cross-cultural studies normally looks at another language, society or\nculture from the vantage point of his own cultural background.\n\n\nHe has in other words, an already built-in bias, whether this reveals\nitself in his work is a matter for him to resolve.\n\n\nOn the other hand, a scholar or researcher studying his own language,\nsociety or culture does not necessarily ensure full objectivity either.\n\n\nHe may fall into error of another sort, that of seeing only the\nstrengths or achievements of his society and ignoring the unpalatable or\nuncomplimentary.\n\n\nAs a specifically human phenomenon, language exemplifies a\nbewildering variety.\n\n\nOn the one hand it is universal or common to all societies and yet on\nthe other it is unique to the set of socio-historical circumstances\nassociated with its community of speakers.\n\n\nLanguage is so extensive and deep-rooted in the human psyche that it\nis not difficult for many to imagine its close identity with thought.\n\n\nEvery person is said to think in and express himself through a\nlanguage.\n\n\nThe tendency to equate thought with language has a history that goes\nback to ancient times.\n\n\nIn a famous passage from Plato, Socrates had raised the question\nconcerning the thought process.\n\n\nTheaetetus was said to have replied that, " when the mind is\nthinking, it is simply talking to itself".\n\n\nIt would appear, therefore, that Plato was inclined to treat thinking\nand talking alike and that when one talks, one implies the use of language.\n\n\nTherefore, to Plato, thought was merely the nominalisation of the\nverb to think.\n\n\nOver the years, others were to echo Plato\'s standpoint and among the\nmost prominent in recent times was Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\n\nFirst of all, Wittgenstein like Berkely, Hobbes and Russell before\nhim was primarily interested in philosophy an explanatory science.\n\n\nThus according to him, philosophy aims at the logical clarification (\nklarung) of thoughts.\n\n\nA philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations (\nerlaute-rungen).\n\n\nPhilosophy does not result in \'philosophical propositions\', but in\nthe clarification ( klarwerden) of propositions.\n\n\nIn the first of his two major philosophical works, the Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus, Wittgenstein attempted to solve the problem of the\nrelation between language and the structure of the world, in other words,\nbetween the meaning of a linguistic symbol and the meaning of the object or\nthing it purports to represent.\n\n\nOrdinary language as he put it did not conduce toward clarity of\nthought ( and by implication elucidate the real meaning of meaning) because\nof its many diverse uses and extraneous embellishments.\n\n\nTherefore to understand how the world is constituted, one has to\ndiscover the basic structure of meaningful language.\n\n\nOnly by doing this can philosophical clarifications of the structure\nof the world have validity.\n\n\nIt can be seen that Wittgenstein was concerned mainly with the\nproblem of philosophical discourse which implicitly involved the use of\nlanguage.\n\n\nThe clarity of philosophical explanation or the elucidation of a\nphilosophical problem depended directly on a language meeting certain basic\nlogical conditions.\n\n\nTherefore to answer the question \'What constitutes meaningful\ndiscourse?\' he developed what has become known as the \'picture theory\' of\nlanguage.\n\n\nThe \'picture theory\' of language as expressed in the Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus contains a number of logical assumptions.\n\n\nIn essence, language is regarded as a totality of propositions.\n\n\nA proposition is said to have meaning if only if it is a picture of\nreality or is a description of a state of affairs.\n\n\nA word or a name is said to mean the object or the object its\nmeaning.\n\n\nGoing on to elaborate his basic standpoint, Wittgenstein explained\nthat to understand the world implies the clarification of one\'s world or the\nstructure of one\'s language.\n\n\nHis philosophy of language therefore, rests on the premise that\nlanguage and the structure of world ( reality) are similar.\n\n\nThe essence of a language, in terms of its basic propositions\nreflects the essence of the structure of the world.\n\n\nThought, according to him, is not possible without language.\n\n\nSince language directly relates to thought, any limitation inherent\nin the former would affect accordingly the realisation of the latter.\n\n\nHis theory of meaning rests on the categorical stance that the\nmeaning of a word lies in its use or alternatively the meaning of a word is\nits use in the language.\n\n\nThough Wittgenstein was mainly concerned with the problem of\nphilosophical explanation, his writings on the relation between language and\nthought and language and meaning have tremendous implications for both the\ntheory and practice of linguistic science.\n\n\nIt is quite possible that his philosophical ideas might have\ninfluenced to some extent at least, the writings of subsequent scholars, in\nparticular Noam Chomsky and Benjamin Lee Whorf though in different ways as we\nshall see later.\n\n\nAt this juncture, several important points need to be made so as to\nprovide some perspective to the discussion.\n\n\nFirst of all, Wittgenstein in his writings implicitly differentiated\nbetween two forms of language viz., the language of everyday use and the\nlanguage of philosophy.\n\n\nThough such a differentiation is made for the purpose of achieving\nexplanatory clarity, both forms of language in effect share the same\nlinguistic structure.\n\n\nIndeed, the language of philosophy is derived directly from the\nlanguage of everyday use.\n\n\nHowever, in making the differentiation Wittgenstein posed an\nimportant problem for studies on language development viz., whether the\nlanguage of science for instance necessarily differ from the language of\nnormal discourse cognitively, and if so in what way.\n\n\nSecondly, Wittgenstein\'s reaffirmation of the Platonic standpoint\nthat thought is not possible without language cannot be accepted without the\nnecessary qualifications.\n\n\nOntogenetically, language and thought have different genetic roots.\n\n\nStudies of children and their development have shown that language\ndevelopment and thought development follow different paths at the initial\nstage.\n\n\nIn the phylogeny of thought and language, a prelinguistic phase in\nthe development of thought and a preintellectual phase in the development of\nlanguage are clearly discernible.\n\n\nThe two are structurally and functionally different from each other.\n\n\nHowever, the two systems ( language and thought) merge to become one\nat a critical period of the child\'s growth process where upon language\nbecomes rational and thought verbal.\n\n\nThere are essentially two critical aspects arising from the\nforegoing.\n\n\nWittgenstein\'s insistence that thought and language are similar does\nemphasise the importance of language in formal thought processes.\n\n\nIn this connection, the influence of language is cumulative in\nintellectual pursuits.\n\n\nIn other words, in the more esoteric spheres of human activity ( e.g.\n\n\nthe use of language in the sciences, in legal practice, and in\ncertain categories of creative writing) the use of language is governed by\nthe need to achieve communicative effectiveness.\n\n\nIn essence this means ( as in the case of the sciences including the\ndrafting of legal documents) the transmission of meaning intention and ideas\nthrough the use of concepts embodied in language.\n\n\nUnderstood in this way, thought ( or its realised concrete form \'concept\')\nand language overlap and assume a unitary existence.\n\n\nThis aspect of language and thought have particular relevance for\nthis study because the primary striving associated with the development of\nnew terminologies in Malay is to formulate concepts which are equivalent to\nthose use in developed modern languages such as English.\n\n\nThis implies in effect, that the structuring of a concept in Malay\ntakes into consideration certain semantic values or alternatively cognitive\nelements.\n\n\nAt least it would imply the adequate matching of cognitive elements\nfound in English and Malay to achieve a satisfactory conceptual outcome.\n\n\nIt can be seen therefore, that in language development of the kind\ndiscussed, the linguistic component ( word, phrase or sentence) must fit the\nconceptual component.\n\n\nMore pertinent however is the fact that in developing new\nterminologies the use of language to afford conceptualisation ( or delineate\nreality and human experience is pursued formally as it is governed by such\ncriteria as: preciseness, absence of ambiguity, accuracy and economy.\n\n\nAn important corollary is the fact that concepts and thought are able\nto meet the aforementioned criteria only if they are socio-culturally\npertinent while at the same time retaining a reasonable degree of stability.\n\n\nFinally, Wittgenstein failed to address certain related issues in\norder to grasp the multi-dimensionality of meaning in language.\n\n\nThe term \'meaning\' has t~ components: the denotative and the\nconnotative, the latter would include the historical, socio-cultural and\nideological elements that influence the semantic status of a word, in other\nwords its cognitive character.\n\n\nTo arrive at meaning therefore, requires an adequate appreciation of\nboth the denotative and connotative components which in turn implies an\nunderstanding of the structure of the world which language is supposed to\ndescribe; the nature of symbolism; the psychology of knowing, understanding,\nand meaning; and finally, the theoretical-philosophical premises marshalled\nto explain it.\n\n\nHowever, Wittgenstein\'s insistence that the meaning of a word must be\nsought in its use points to a fundamental fact about language viz., that\nmeaning should be understood in terms of what it does - pragmatics.\n\n\nIt is a view of language that is best exemplified in Malinowski\'s\ntheory of meaning.\n\n\nEqually important was Wittgenstein\'s suggestion that language implies\nrules and that it is the rules that give it its internal logic.\n\n\nWittgenstein\'s philosophical interpretation of language serves as a\nuseful starting point for a more detailed examination of the various\nsubstantive issues raised.\n\n\nIn order to do this the contribution of linguists will be given\nattention first.\n\n\nA systematic examination of their views about the nature of language\nwill help to elucidate the problem of cognition at a later point.\n\n\nThe single most important theoretical construct that has influenced\nthe science of linguistics is no doubt the \'structuralism\' of Ferdinand de\nSaussure.\n\n\nStructuralism is " a scientific description of language in terms of\nrelations between units, irrespective of any properties which may be\ndisplayed by these units".\n\n\nIt seeks to discover linguistic relationships or configurations\nwhether they involve sounds or meanings " not on the surface but below and\nbehind empirical reality".\n\n\nAccording to de Saussure, speech or language exists as a sum of\nimpressions on the one hand and a mass of heterogeneous speech facts on the\nother.\n\n\nIt would be impossible to account for every individual variation.\n\n\nTherefore, in order to set the correct path for linguistic enquiry,\none has to differentiate between the specific or personal idiosyncrasies of\nspeech exemplified by a speaker ( la parole) and the norms or rules governing\nthe use of speech ( la langue).\n\n\nThe former is " the executive side" of speech and is characterised by\nvariation, such variations being due to physiological differences relating to\nthe production of speech.\n\n\nThe latter, on the other hand, " is both a social product of the\nfaculty of speech and a collection of necessary conventions that have been\naccepted by a social body to permit individuals to exercise that faculty".\n\n\n\'La parole\' is equated with speech whereas \'la langue\' ( which is\ncharacterised by homogeneity, concreteness, and stability) is equated with\nlanguage.\n\n\nThe proper subject of study, according to de Saussure should be \'la\nlangue\' which as he defines it, " is a system of signs in which the only\nessential thing is the union of meanings and sound-images, and in which both\nparts of the sign are psychological." \n\n\nHis differentiation between \'la parole\' ( the individual aspect or\nspeech) as against \'la langue\' ( the social aspect or language) sets to\nidentify language in its two contrasting yet mutually interdependent\ncomponents.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd2fa1681-f120-419a-aa15-b9c517ff21c5', 'added':

{'text': 'A Cloze Question \n\n\nLee Gek Ling\n\n\n Background To The Hypothesis \n\n\nI chose this project because it worries me that so much store is put\nby cloze scores in the kinds of proficiency tests I have been involved in\nlike the Qualifying English Test ( QEI) at the National University of\nSingapore and the RELC English Proficiency Test.\n\n\nIn the former, students are exempted from having to take remedial\nEnglish classes if their scores on the 100 item cloze section of the QET are\nabove a predetermined percentage ( ie the percentage is arrived at\nintuitively and does not represent the median of the test population).\n\n\nDuring the course of teaching the students who are given remedial\nEnglish lessons, I have noticed that scores on cloze seem to improve with\npractice.\n\n\nBut, not all students who do well on the cloze ( especially by the\nexact word scoring method) necessarily write as proficiently as their cloze\nscores would indicate.\n\n\nCeteris paribus cloze scores are claimed by some researchers as being\nhighly correlated to other tests of language ability including\nfree-expression writing, ( Shohamy 1983; Chavez-Oller et al 1985; Hale et al\n1989).\n\n\nWhat then is the exact nature of the validity of a cloze test of\nproficiency and what degree of proficiency does it show?\n\n\n My Hypothesis \n\n\nMy hypothesis is that cloze tests are as mechanical to complete as\nthey are to construct and score.\n\n\nFurthermore that test scores on the cloze are not as indicative of\nactual language proficiency as has been claimed.\n\n\nRelatively high scores can be obtained by testees who in actual terms\nhave low language proficiency, through extra-linguistic factors such as luck\n( especially with content words in exact word scoring).\n\n\nAnd lower scores could be obtained by testees who otherwise have high\nlevels of language proficiency.\n\n\nIf this is so, then the validity and consequently the reliability of\ncloze procedure in proficiency testing may be questionable.\n\n\nIt is with this hypothesis in mind that I conducted a small scale\nexperiment to illustrate my point.\n\n\nThis paper reviews the major work related to my hypothesis, describes\nmy experiment, discusses my findings and presents some conclusions.\n\n\n Literature Overview \n\n\nThis overview is divided into four sections: historical, research\nsupporting cloze, research objecting to aspects of cloze and research\nsuggesting variations of cloze.\n\n\nHistorical Overview Taylor ( 1953) developed cloze originally as an\nindex for test readability, ( how accessible a text would be to readers).\n\n\nThe psychological traits for cloze are underpinned by the Gestalt\nnotion of closure, ( the completion of pictures or shapes by subjects as an\nindication of how their mind functions).\n\n\nTaylor\'s cloze procedure replicated this trait by requiring testees\nto replace original words which had been blanked out in a text.\n\n\nThe rate of accuracy at which testees could fill in the blanks with\nthe exact original words would show how easy or difficult a text was to read.\n\n\nOver the years cloze has become a test of " reader-ability" ( Johnson\n1981) in understanding a text, as well as an important instrument in\nplacement and proficiency tests not only in the classroom but also in\nnation-wide norm referenced tests.\n\n\nMuch has been written about cloze validity and reliability over the\nlast 37 years.\n\n\nA pattern emerges of a group of researchers who are pro-cloze,\nanother who are against it and a third whose research attempts to redress the\nproblems raised by the second group in order to be reconciled with the merits\nof cloze proposed by the first group.\n\n\nIt is this pattern which I wish to discuss below.\n\n\n Pro-Cloze \n\n\nCloze was adopted by language testers to test general proficiency in\nthe ascent of the Unitary Hvpothesis Theory ( a holistic view of language\nlearning and teaching) because cloze lends itself to the notion of a global\nview of language proficiency as it assesses more than two skills.\n\n\nIt is thought to be a good indicator of general language ability\nbecause the testee is required to make use of contextual clues ( which draw\non comprehension skills) and to supply answers ( drawing on syntactic and\nsemantic mastery).\n\n\nOller supports the idea of cloze as a test of general proficiency, he\nsays: " the cloze procedure is sometimes construed to be a measure of reading\nability, though it may be just as much a measure of writing, listening and\nspeaking ability" ( 1979: 8).\n\n\nShohamy ( 1983) is equally pro-cloze, claiming the highest\ncorrelation of cloze to other language tests of proflciency.\n\n\nHer study showed a significant concurrent validity of cloze to the\noral Interview of 0.872.\n\n\nPrima facie cloze seems to be integrative.\n\n\nIn classical cloze, a fixed deletion rate randomly deletes any part\nof speech every nth word.\n\n\nHence in a 350 word passage there should be 50 blanks at a deletion\nrate of every 7 words.\n\n\nThose 50 blanks would contain both content and function words in\nwhatever ratio that particular text gave rise to.\n\n\nThis randomness is one of the statistical advantages that cloze is\nsaid to have by its supporters.\n\n\nIts detractors argue that it is this randomness which gives rise to\nunpredictability in the ratio of content to function words).\n\n\nAnother attraction of the cloze is the ease with which a test can be\nconstructed since Oller states that " the cloze procedure is probably\nappropriate to just about any text" ( 1979: 364); Doer ( 1980) and\nChavez-Oller ( 1985) agree.\n\n\nHeaton ( 1989) cites studies to show that ideally only 40-50 blanks\nare needed at an optimum deletion rate of between every fifth to seventh word\nto get an adequate number of test items).\n\n\nShohamy ( 1983) suggests that every eleventh word and 25 blanks is\nequally optimal.\n\n\nTherefore the cloze appears to be a very economical test to\nconstruct.\n\n\nThe cloze has high reliability in scoring when the exact word only is\nscored as correct.\n\n\nThis is more probably because there is a high degree of objectivity\namong raters.\n\n\nHowever it is this very construct validity and reliability which are\nthe most strongly debated issues in the work of detractors of cloze.\n\n\nThese debates are discussed in the next section.\n\n\n Anti-Cloze \n\n\nSome of the issues which have emerged are: the unpredictability of\ncontent to function words in random cloze ( Alderson 1979), the subjectivity\nof the text content ( Grotjahn 1987: Klein-Braley 1985), the insensitivity to\ncross-sentential boundaries ( Alderson 1979: Farhady 1979: Bachman 1982:\nJohnson 1982).\n\n\nAlderson ( 1979) notes that changes in the deletion rate changes the\nmeasure of proficiency.\n\n\nHence cloze has an element of unpredictability which affects the\nreliability of the test.\n\n\nHe argues that randomness may be justified when cloze is used as a\nmeasure of text readability but not as a measure of proficiency.\n\n\nGrotjahn ( 1987) writing on an idea developed by Raatz and\nKein-Braley ( 1985), argues against the wholesale adoption of classical cloze\nfor the following reasons.\n\n\nCloze is unfair because of text-specificity: there are many variables\naffecting reliability such as deletion rate, choice of text and method of\nscoring.\n\n\nFurthermore the unpredictability of the ratio of content to function\nwords affects the kind or degree of proficiency being measured.\n\n\nOller ( 1979) and Chavez-Oller ( 1985) claim that choice of text does\nnot matter.\n\n\nJohnson ( 1982) shows by illustration with a technical text on\nChomskian grammar that the choice of text does matter and that such a text\ncould not successfully be clozed except by a linguist.\n\n\nMoreover even a general interest text may be culturally biased.\n\n\nFor example blank 94 in the 1988 QET required students to cloze the\nphrase " ...Protestant Work ( 94)"\n\n\nWhile a careful examination of texts for readability and clozability\ncould minimise such problems, texts cannot be chosen completely free of\nbiased items especially in classical cloze tests.\n\n\nOne of the reasons why cloze is so strongly upheld by renowned\nlanguage testers such as Oller is because of its psychological trait of\nglobal language skills.\n\n\nMarkham ( 1985: 423) suggests that " the cloze procedure may not\nyield a valid and reliable assessment of global ( complete) comprehension.\n\n\nHe pits second language research which shows that cloze is sensitive\nacross sentences against first language research which says cloze is only\nsensitive to its immediate environment.\n\n\nHis argument is supported by Farhady ( 1979), Johnson ( 1982),\nBaehman ( 1982) and Klein-Braley ( 1983).\n\n\nBecause cloze is sensitive both to immediate environment ( function\nwords such as articles) and across sentences ( anaphors), one cannot be\ncertain that enough cross-essential items are present in any given text to\nclaim that global language skills are truly being tested.\n\n\nAs Johnson ( 1982) asks, what exactly is being assessed?\n\n\nWhat degree of proficiency is being measured?\n\n\nThis insensitivity to discourse cohesion leads to the issue of lack\nof discrimination.\n\n\nThere is no certainty about the ratio of content to function words\nbecause of random deletion.\n\n\nThis is important if content words ( adjectives, nouns, adverbs and\nverbs) are more demanding to cloze than function words which can be\nmechanically clozed, for instance the blank preceding a singular countable\nnoun in the absence of an adjective has to be clozed with an article.\n\n\nTo some extent I have found that the mechanics of cloze can be\ntaught, which in itself is a negative backwash effect ( cf.\n\n\nCarrel 1985).\n\n\nThere is no discrimination of language skills when all the test items\nin a cloze test are scored equally although some of the items may be more\ndifficult to cloze than others.\n\n\nAlderson ( 1979) argues that cloze tests are not suitable for higher\norder language skills, although cloze may provide a measure of lower order\nlanguage proficiency.\n\n\nThis is because cloze is more sensitive to the immediate environment\n( Bachman 1982).\n\n\nJohnson in agreeing with this argument, illustrates it with an\nexample of a cloze that can be completed without using global skills.\n\n\nHeaton ( 1988) observes that cloze discriminates between the most and\nthe least proficient cloze testees in a given population.\n\n\nHowever, it does not discriminate within the middle band.\n\n\nThis means that the bulk of the population is not discriminated\nfinely enough; which may be a significant drawback in placement tests.\n\n\nStatistically cloze is a valid instrument within a population for\nrelative measures of proficiency.\n\n\nHowever on an individual basis in terms of actual language\nproficiency, cloze does not discriminate well enough ( Hughes 1989).\n\n\nFor example, a proficient candidate\'s score on a cloze scored by the\nexact answer method may not be an accurate reflection of his actual\nproficiency skills.\n\n\nThis lack of discrimination ( and fairness) leads to next issue of\nscoring methods.\n\n\nOller ( 1979) asserts that there is no significant difference in\nscores between the exact word only and acceptable synonym method of scoring.\n\n\nFurthermore Hinofotis ( 1980) says that there is a difference in\nreliability between the two scoring methods.\n\n\nHowever, Brown ( 1980) shows that accepting synonyms gives\nsignificantly higher scores.\n\n\nWhy is scoring an issue?\n\n\nAnd is it a valid issue?\n\n\nIt is an issue because it involves conflicts of interests between two\nfundamentals of testing - objectivity of the markers and fairness to the\ntestees.\n\n\nAccepting the exact answer only appears more objective.\n\n\nIt is easier, but is it fair?\n\n\nThe original word is already a product of an author\'s idiosyncratic\ndiction.\n\n\nIs it fair to ask testees to guess at and replicate correctly this\nidiosyncrasy?\n\n\nIs it valid to assume that the ability to replace the exact original\nword is indeed an irrefutable sign of proficiency?\n\n\nMight not highly proficient testees cloze the blanks with acceptable\nsynonyms from their large vocabularies?\n\n\nSurely, it is not enough to say that the majority of any given\npopulation performs normally and therefore only relative proficiency is\nnecessary.\n\n\nRelative proficiency is only meaningful within a population: it has\nno meaning outside of it.\n\n\nRelative proficiency may be enough within an institution like the NUS\nwhen deciding which students need remedial English classes most ( ceteris\nparibus there is validity and reliability), but in national tests such as the\nPSLE ( the Singapore Primary School Leaving Certificate) the moral dimension\nbecomes much stronger.\n\n\nAn individual\'s score relative to his classmates may deprive him of a\nchance for secondary education or a place at a top secondary school. \n\n\nHowever his actual abilities may be equal to a higher grade in\nanother cohort in another year.\n\n\nA valid question may be how many such individuals exist?\n\n\nAnd at what cost is the negative backwash effect on them and the\nnation worth?\n\n\nCastillo ( personal communication) says that the ability to replace\nthe exact original word is an indication of accurate reading and therefore\nalso proficiency ( here defined as the prediction of success in any given\ncourse, not as elsewhere in this paper defined as language mastery).\n\n\nTwo objections which arise are: what is the exact nature of the\nrelationship between success on exact-word replication and success on a\ncourse of language testing?\n\n\nSecondly Tatlonghari ( personal communication) talked of research\non schemata or the mental baggage brought by the

{'text': 'Task-based Testing \n\n\nby Teng Su Ching\n\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency Unit National University of Singapore\n\n\n Influences on Testing - - Linguistic and Pedagogic Theories \n\n\nLanguage tests aim to give a picture of a student\'s level of\n\nproficiency as a result of the language programme that he has undergone.\n\n\nThey are, therefore, directly influenced by pedagogic theories which\nin turn derive their raison d\'etre from prevailing linguistic theories.\n\n\nThus, during the period when language was thought of as comprising a\nsystem of rules which could be learnt, language learning consisted mainly of\nlearning structural forms.\n\n\nTwo pedagogic theories that supported this view of language were the\nstructuralist-behaviourist approach, based on the work of behavioural\npsychologists like Pavlov and Skinner, and the\ngenerative-transformationalist approach, a cognitive and\nproblem-solving approach based on the work of Chomsky.\n\n\nTesting procedures that came with these methodologies consisted mainly\nof testing discrete grammatical elements.\n\n\nAn important development in linguistics was to revolutionalise\npedagogic and testing theories and this is the view that the language system\nevolves from the functions it serves.\n\n\nThe most important proponent of this functional perspective of\nlanguage is Halliday who sees language as inextricably a part of the\nsituation in which it is used and its internal structure or form is important\nin so far as it has meaning potential in being able to communicate meaning.\n\n\nIn the 1970s, in line with this new orientation in linguistics,\npedagogy moved in the direction of meaningful social experiences as the basis\nfor the teaching/learning process.\n\n\nThis perspective is actualised in the shift from teaching language as\nan abstract system to teaching what language can do to convey meaning.\n\n\nA recent and important contribution to methodology within the\ncommunicative paradigm came out of psycholinguistic research.\n\n\nOne finding is that learners have the " inherent psychological\ncapability to acquire linguistic competence when this capacity acts upon\ncomprehensible input" ( Breen 1987).\n\n\nAnother is that learners possess strategies to manage new input by\nimposing a certain kind of order on what they encounter to facilitate\nlanguage learning.\n\n\nThat they use such strategies shows that learners can be\nmetacommunicative when they are being communicative.\n\n\nThis new perspective of the learners\' active intervention in the\npedagogic process has given rise to a new process-related approach which\naddresses the strategies by which learners achieve communicative\neffectiveness.\n\n\nA realization of this process-related approach is the task-based\nmethodology.\n\n\nThis methodology requires the learner to perform tasks which mobilise\nhis underlying competence such that he employs both " overt interpersonal and\ncovert personal negotiations of meaning" ( Breen 1987).\n\n\nThese are not new strategies for the learner but merely knowledge\nsystems he is already familiar with as a communicator in his own language.\n\n\nIf the tasks are meaningful and challenging enough, the learner will\nmobilise his underlying knowledge, however limited it may be, in order to\ncommunicate.\n\n\nAn important proponent of the task-based approach is Prabhu ( 1987)\nwho sees learning a language as building holistically on a complex cognitive\nsystem which we do not have an explicit understanding of.\n\n\nIt seems to be a system that enables the learner to bring all\navailable cognitive resources to his effort to communicate.\n\n\n Assessing Competence through Performance \n\n\nTesting procedures which attempt to operationalise the communicative\nideology face many uncertainties, the most prominent being what to test and\nhow to assess, especially since the notion of " communicative" has not been\ndefinitive though it is obvious that it should include certain criteria\nfeatures of authentic language use.\n\n\nRea ( 1985) makes an explicit distinction between communicative\ncompetence and performance.\n\n\nCompetence is defined as knowledge in the form of an abstract system\nstored in an individual\'s mind and it " cannot be assessed in any direct way"\n( 1985: 21).\n\n\nPerformance, on the other hand, is an observable language behaviour\nwhich can be directly assessed.\n\n\nAll linguistic behaviour is performance and it is " only through\nperformance that we may infer levels of competence" ( 1985: 21).\n\n\nPerformance can be non-communicative, for example, in test formats\nwhich require mere manipulation of the code and are atomistic in approach.\n\n\nCommunicative performance on the other hand, is meaning dependent and\ncontext-bound, involving the mobilisation of " grammatical, sociolinguistic,\nstrategic and any other competencies" ( 1985 : 24).\n\n\nIt allows for the global assessment of an integrated performance.\n\n\nHow can all these be translated into a testing procedure?\n\n\nTesting within a Context We must, first of all, bear in mind the\nmultidimensional use of language, the varied communication situations in\nwhich language is used and, therefore, the need to narrow focus in testing to\nmore specific areas.\n\n\nThe emergence of English for Specific Purposes ( ESP) pedagogy\nenables a more explicit definition of communicativeness within a specific\nsituation where performance criteria can be identified.\n\n\nOne such situation is English for Academic Purposes ( EAP).\n\n\nAn EAP test tests a learner\'s communicative effectiveness in an\nacademic situation.\n\n\nWhereas once EAP was dominated by the concept of registers with an\nemphasis on the relative frequencies of occurrence of syntactic and lexical\nitems, now the orientation is towards a holistic view of language in a\ncommunicative academic environment where language is a functional system\noperating within a specific discoursal framework.\n\n\nNext, we must consider the operative criteria which make for an\neffective communicative test.\n\n\nMorrow ( 1979) identified seven criteria features of communicative\nlanguage use which should be considered in any test that purports to measure\ncommunicative competence.\n\n\nThese features are that language use is interaction-based,\nunpredictable in its interaction, contextual, purposive, performance-based,\nauthentic and has a behavioural outcome.\n\n\nTo this list we might add that the test should mobilise the testee\'s\nunderlying linguistic and cognitive systems in an integrated performance.\n\n\nThere is a general belief that there is no such thing as a test of\nauthentic language behaviour ( Stevenson 1985, Spolsky 1985).\n\n\nThere are only authentic language tests.\n\n\nA test with its temporal and psychological constraints is already\ncompromising real-life language use.\n\n\nTo try to measure performance in authentic real-life situations means\nto conduct a longitudinal study of the candidate, following him around and\nobserving how he functions as a student - - taking notes at lectures,\ndiscussing with teachers and peers at tutorials and seminars, writing reports\nand the like.\n\n\nEven this mode of evaluation has a constraint: knowing that he is\nbeing " trailed", as it were, puts him on his guard and his performance is\nless natural, less authentic.\n\n\nBearing this caveat in mind, we may, however, choose to be satisfied\nwith an authentic task which requires the holistic use of language.\n\n\n Task-based Testing \n\n\nAn authentic task in the EAP context is one which a tertiary student\nis likely to perform in real life in his academic course.\n\n\nExamples of authentic tasks are making notes from what he sees and\nhears, transcoding information from non-verbal ( charts, graphs, tables)\ninto verbal forms or vice versa, writing reports, making oral presentations\nand participating in discussions.\n\n\nThe ability to perform all these real life tasks presupposes\nproficiency in certain enabling skills, mainly higher order receptive and\nproductive skills.\n\n\nHigher order receptive or comprehension skills comprise a dynamic\ninteraction of inferencing, synthesising and critical evaluation resulting in\nthe student constantly monitoring his state of understanding.\n\n\nCritical evaluation is an important metacognitive strategy.\n\n\nA very important component of comprehension is the processing of\nnon-verbal forms of information because this is where language " ceases in\neffect to be the primary element in the communication: it takes on an\ninterpretative role - - explaining, highlighting or contextualising what is\nvisually observable" ( Hutchinson and Waters 1981).\n\n\nInterpreting non-verbal forms also calls for the employment of the\nhigher order strategies of inferencing, synthesising and critical evaluation.\n\n\nHandling visual data also entails another cognitive process - -\nperceptual proficiency in order to transform the visual display into\nmeaningful mental representation and eventual comprehension.\n\n\nWithin the testing environment, productive skills are skills\nattendant on comprehension.\n\n\nThey are usually demonstrated in composition and summary writing,\nnote-taking and note-making and even in non-verbal forms.\n\n\nBasically a test of productive skills is a test of a candidate\'s\nproficiency as a competent communicator.\n\n\nProduction presupposes reception and comprehension which is\ntraditionally tested by answering comprehension questions of the open-ended\nor close-ended multiple-choice type.\n\n\nHowever, comprehension can also be demonstrated in a more productive\nand dynamic performance, for example, the reorganisation of information into\nverbal or non-verbal forms to serve the purpose for which the information is\nelicited.\n\n\n Sample Questions \n\n\nAn example of a test question that attempts to incorporate the above\nprinciples comes from the Joint Matriculation Board Test in English (\nOverseas) March 1979 written paper.\n\n\nThe JMB Test ( recently revised and renamed the University Entrance\nTest in English for Speakers of Other Languages or UETESOL) was a university\nqualifying test conducted by the northern universities of Manchester,\nLiverpool, Leeds, Sheffield and Birmingham.\n\n\n( Please refer to Appendix A for guestion 1) In this question, the\ncandidate is tested on his ability to understand the communicative value of a\nnon-verbal device and to recode this information into a verbal form.\n\n\nHere the visual stimuli is a cross section of a windmill.\n\n\nProductive skills with respect to two particular core language\nfunctions are assessed - - general description ( Write about the appearance\nof the mill and its equipment) and description of process ( Write about how\nwheat is ground into flour).\n\n\nThe process is indicated by arrows.\n\n\nThe correctness of the steps in the process also requires perceptual\nefficiency in order to make sense of the arrows.\n\n\nIn the description of process, narrative padding is also necessary in\ndescribing the structure of the grinding stone given in the inset.\n\n\nWhile the rubric is precise and the diagram clear, the actual outcome\ndoes not just involve a straightforward description of process as some\ncognitive processing is also needed to conceptualise the whole process of\ngrinding wheat and to make sense of the technical principles behind energy\ngenerated by the wind, the mechanics of cog and wheels and the concept of\npressure and friction for the actual grinding.\n\n\nThere is, thus, a certain amount of bias as the ability to do the\nquestion effectively presupposes knowledge of the above stated principles\nwhich test constructors can defend as general scientific principles which a\ntechnological society is familiar with ( Please refer to Appendix B for\nQuestion 5A) Question 5A of the JMB June 1979 paper tests comprehension of an\nextended text.\n\n\nThe candidate has to demonstrate his comprehension by performing a\ntask using higher order comprehension skills ( eg skimming and scanning) and\nhigher order cognitive skills ( eg hypothesizing, evaluating,\nproblem-solving).\n\n\nWhat is interesting about this question is that it is an attempt to\nevaluate the reading process by the very nature of the question.\n\n\nThe product of comprehension is the attempted task.\n\n\nWhile the product is the operational criterion of comprehension, the\nquestion ensures the use of higher level strategies to arrive at the product.\n\n\nSo, indirectly, the efficient use of these strategies are being\ntested.\n\n\nAlso to arrive at the product, the candidate needs to comprehend the\ninstructions and carry them out accurately.\n\n\nIn the process of completing the task set, the reader does not just\nreproduce information from the text but has to reorganise data to suit the\ntask.\n\n\nThe complex and involved task tests global comprehension.\n\n\nIt does more than just assess the ability to locate specific\ninformation.\n\n\nIt calls for the ability to scan for particular information, extract,\nsummarise and manipulate information, make inferences and apply the\ninformation to the solution of a related problem ( UETESOL Syllabus 1990).\n\n\nUnderlying the task is the reorganisation of information to gain\ninsight into rhetorical relationships, even though the structure of the\nrhetorical organisation is made apparent in the question itself ( Table 1 in\nAppendix B).\n\n\nIt also requires the use of one\'s background knowledge to visualise\nthe appearance of " box-like kite", " triangular-shaped bodies" or "\nbird-like wings".\n\n\nAnother important feature is the use of the non-verbal medium.\n\n\nHere the candidate has to transcode verbal cues into a non-verbal\nmedium by matching description and picture.\n\n\nBy requiring an identification through description of the physical\nappearance, the question calls for small pieces of information to be\nsynthesised to build up an image. \n\n\nThe advantage of task-based testing is that it allows orientation to\na clearly definable and purposive activity in a particular communicative\nsituation, for example, the academic environment, and the assessment of the\nstrategies required to perform in this environment.\n\n\nTask-based testing addresses the overall capacity to perform.\n\n\nThis testing methodology is basically a problem-solving approach\nwhere linguistic and non-linguistic resources operate together on inputs to\nreach a solution.\n\n\nSuch inputs are varied in form and content and can be graphic or\nverbal, stated or inferred.\n\n\n Grammar and its Assesment in Task-based Testing \n\n\nCommunicative testing should not only test the conveying of meaning\nwith a total disregard for form as a show of the complete rejection of the\nideology of the structural era.\n\n\nPrabhu ( in personal communication) sees two positions that grammar\ncan assume in communicative testing: first, grammar in response to linguistic\nelicitation and second, grammar in response to a task.\n\n\nThe first position, as the name suggests, is very much a matter of\nthe candidate\'s demonstration of grammatical knowledge.\n\n\nWhen grammar is to be elicited deliberately, the test constructor\ncan choose to test particular linguistic items.\n\n\nFor example, if he chooses to assess a candidate\'s control of the\ntenses, he would probably set a contrived situation which requires the\nstudent to use different tenses, a procedure unlikely to be matched in\nreal-life language use.\n\n\nThere is reliability in assessing the candidate\'s knowledge of this\ngrammatical item based on how many right answers he gives.\n\n\nIn communicative testing, where authentic language use is a\npremium, deliberate elicitation of grammatical knowledge has a price, namely,\na low level of validity.\n\n\nWhere grammatical competence is not elicited, but deployed\nspontaneously when a task is being performed, the ability shown is genuine.\n\n\nWith grammar in deployment, there is less opportunity for testing\nthe candidate\'s knowledge of specific grammatical items since a candidate may\nor may not employ those particular items in performing a task.\n\n\nIt is, however, a valid method of testing a candidate\'s control of\nthe code as a whole for the purpose of conveying meaning.\n\n\nIt is in these two positions of grammar that the tension between\nvalidity and reliability becomes obvious.\n\n\nThe importance that a test constructor places on grammar can be\nreflected in the weighting for the completed task and the language control.\n\n\nHe may even choose to use the task to test only grammatical\ncompetence because the grammar that emerges out of a task performance is the\ntest taker\'s norm and is a genuine product of his communicative competence.\n\n\nA grammar test, therefore, does not need to be a discrete point\ntest.\n\n\nA task-based or holistic test can function as a test of grammatical\ncompetence as well as a test of naturalistic language behaviour.\n\n\n Conclusion \n\n\nIntegrated performance approximates real-life language use more\nclosely than does the perception of language use as comprising distinct\nskills.\n\n\nIn integrated performance, all necessary abilities are employed\nsimultaneously in the same act of communication.\n\n\nThis essential holism in real-life language underlies the\ntask-based testing procedure.\n\n\nPedagogy is now concerned with teaching the learner how to do\nthings with language.\n\n\nTesting must be concerned with giving the testee the opportunity to\ndemonstrate what he can do with language in a purposeful manner.\n\n\nIt should not only be concerned with producing a score.\n\n\nTest constructors have the responsibility to innovate on present\nprocedures so that teaching and testing can move in tandem within the\ncommunicative paradigm.', 'subdomain':

{'text': 'BATIK: CREATING AN IDENTITY By Lee Chor Lin \n\n\nBatik is a resist-dyeing technique used to decorate finished fabrics.\n\n\nUsed by dyers of different ethnicity, cultural background and\n\nhistorical experience, it can be found in almost all continents, though\nrarely as the primary method for producing decorated fabrics.\n\n\nThe process of batik is simple but tedious: on a piece of plain\nfabric, motifs are delineated using a paste-like substance derived from rice,\nbeans, mud or wax.\n\n\nThe clean space around this paste-covered area is now the background\nof a motif.\n\n\nWhen immersed in a dye bath, the motif that is outlined will resist\nthe dyeing, while the clean space now absorbs the colour of the dyestuff.\n\n\nOnce the paste is cleaned off, the motif is shaped by the undyed\nnegative space on the cloth.\n\n\nA second colour may be added to the motif if the cloth is dipped into\nanother dye bath, this time, with the entire background space covered with\nthe paste so as to resist the second dyeing.\n\n\nMost batik are dyed with two to three colours and every colour takes\none round of resist-application and dyeing.\n\n\nThe process has to be repeated as many times as there are colours\nrequired.\n\n\nBatik is not a widely practised technique in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nIn the mainland of Southeast Asia, batik is used by the Tai speaking\npeoples who began to migrate from Southwestern China into Indochina and\nThailand around the 17th century.\n\n\nHere batik is rendered with a rice paste resist on homespun and\nhome-woven cotton dyed in indigo.\n\n\nIn the island world of Southeast Asia, batik looks very different\nfrom the narrow strips of monochrome fabrics made in the mainland.\n\n\nUsed only in limited areas - Java, southern Sumatra and central\nSulawesi - batik of the island world offers more patterns and colours, while\nits usage is more widespread than in the mainland.\n\n\nEvidence to relate the mainland batik tradition to that of the island\nworld is still scarce and highly conjectural.\n\n\nHowever, it is the Javanese tradition of batik, which was also\nintroduced to southern Sumatra, that has created the most dynamic and\nprolific range of fabrics.\n\n\nHere batik became not just a simple dyeing technique, but the name of\nthe fabric is also identified with the people of Java.\n\n\nThose areas associated through trading network with Java and southern\nSumatra are also included as part of this batik culture.\n\n\nThis book focuses on the batik culture within and outside Java: a\nculture that is maintained on an almost addictive passion for the brilliant\ncolours and dynamic figures created by batik.\n\n\n Batik in Java \n\n\nDespite its importance in Javanese culture and economy, the early\nhistory of batik in Java is not well recorded.\n\n\nThe use of the copper-spout called canting to fix the resist on cloth\nis known as batik tulis in Java.\n\n\nLiterally this means " to write" or " to draw".\n\n\nWhen Javanese literature of the 12th-century mentions coloured\nfabrics with terms like tulis warna, or randi tinulis, one is uncertain if\nthese referred to batik ( Christie.\n\n\n1990 1617), although the possibility is very high.\n\n\nThese terms could also mean the direct application of dyes on the\nfabric.\n\n\nForeign travellers mentioned that cloth was produced in Java.\n\n\nThe Chinese apparently knew that the Javanese wove both silk and\ncotton textiles during the ninth and tenth centuries.\n\n\nWang Dayuan, a Yang Dayuan, a Yuan-dynasty harbour-master, made two\ntrips to maritime Southeast Asia during the early 13th century and wrote in\nDaoyi zhilue ( completed around 1349) that the people in east Java produced a\nprinted fabric that was fine and extremely colourfast ( jixijian naise\nyinbu).\n\n\nAt Pekalongan ( Bajienajian), he also identified with conviction\nanother printed cloth with patterns whose colour " would not run" ( huayinbu\nbutuise).\n\n\nUnfortunately his rather condensed writing does not provide details\non the production of these fabrics.\n\n\nThese two entries do suggest that Javanese could have been printing\ntheir own textiles with patterns, for the word hua ( meaning " flower") when\nused together with other textile terms, implies the presence of colours as\nwell as patterns.\n\n\nThey are by no means the first mentions of batik, but seem to suggest\nthat though Indian printed cotton fabrics were prized goods sought after by\nIndonesians during this period, there was very likely a fabric-printing\nindustry in Java during the 14th century.\n\n\nThe printing technique may have started with the direct application\nof dyes with woodblocks or stamps.\n\n\nIt is possible that Javanese batik derives from block-dyeing rather\nthan the use of resist-application.\n\n\nYet Wang\'s conviction that the colour " would not run" certainly\nsuggests that the dyeing technique would have been more sophisticated than a\nsimple direct application of dye.\n\n\nImmersing a cloth in a dye bath completely, as in batik, secures the\ncolour better.\n\n\nJava\'s batik tradition nonetheless remains hazy until much later.\n\n\nIf one takes the argument expounded by KRT Hardjonagoro, Indonesia\'s\nbest-known expert on batik, that the art of batik took its formal shape\nduring the reign of Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo in the early 17th century\nMataram kingdom ( Solyom.\n\n\n1984: 40), then Wang Dayuan\'s hasty notes about the printed cloth\nwould refer to the prototype that developed into the art which the Mataram\nrulers promoted.\n\n\nIt is from this later period that many of the classical batik\npatterns and motifs, dyed in a brown and blue colour scheme, were created,\nidentified and institutionalised by the Mataram kingdom of central Java.\n\n\nWhen batik styles crystalised in the Mataram kingdom, it would most\nprobably have taken the form we see today with patterns drawn on white cloth\nby the use of a canting with melted wax.\n\n\nThe cotton cloth would have been imported from India or from local\ncultivation.\n\n\nThe Mataram kingdom merged six to seven centuries of selection and\nadaptation of HinduBuddhist ideas, like those expressed on monumental\nachievements like Borobudur and Prambanan in central Java.\n\n\nIndeed the Mataram kingdom can be viewed as the blue-print for modern\nJavanese culture.\n\n\nClassical style batik provides a continuity of aesthetics from that\nkingdom.\n\n\nTrade goods that appear in the various parts of Java were also very\nimportant and inspiring sources for batikmakers.\n\n\nMotifs that appeared on silks from China and printed cotton from\nIndia were translated onto batik.\n\n\nLater these external elements became adopted as part of the rich\nvocabulary in batik.\n\n\nWhile exotic foreign items were sought after by the upper echelons of\nJavanese society as prestigious indicators of wealth and social position, the\nrest of the Javanese population were acquainted with the cheaper range of\nimported goods.\n\n\nThe batik industry prospered in the face of competition imposed by\nother textiles.\n\n\nIn fact, cheaper printed cottons from India and Europe were always\navailable in the market.\n\n\nThe issue of the existence of production in the north-coast ( the\nPasisir) aside, central Javanese batik were certainly found in bulk, in major\ntowns of the coast, like Semarang ( Lombard, D.\n\n\n1989: 274).\n\n\nThe History of Sir Stamford Raffles, who wrote the tome during the\nearly years of the 19th century, contain probably the earliest detailed\ndescriptions of the technique and the fabric.\n\n\nThe coloured plates published in the two-volume work are perhaps the\nmost often used historical visual evidence of the fabric, seen through\nwestern eyes.\n\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the cities of the Pasisir emerged as\nimportant batik centres, where many workshops were started and managed by\nnon-Javanese: Arabs, Chinese,Europeans and IndoDutch Eurasians.The Swedish\nExplorer Carl Bock claimed that in Surabaya, east Java, tulis batik was the\nprincipal industry for the women ( Bock, 1870:10).\n\n\nThere was much encouragement from the local leadership and the Dutch\ncolonial government.\n\n\nThe import of machine woven cotton from Holland was an important\nfactor in contributing to the visual definition of batik.\n\n\nThe fine weave of European machine woven cotton provided a smooth and\ntight surface for complex patterns to be drawn on.\n\n\nThe Chinese in Java seemed to have been involved in much of the\npretreatment of cotton cloth and in the dyeing process ( Vuldy 1987: 104).\n\n\nBy the early 20th century, their workshops were responsible for large\nquantities of various qualities of batik.\n\n\nThe invention of metal blocks for waxing batik motifs initiated a\nrevolutionary change in the batik industry of Java, by increasing the volume\nof production.\n\n\nThe golden age of batik probably commenced from this point up to the\nWorld War 11.\n\n\nBatik of this period are the best representation of Javanese artistic\nachievement and of the social significance of the Javanese society.\n\n\nThe scale of batik production and its usage inside and outside of\nJava made batik a very cosmopolitan fashion expression which should be\nexamined as an important segment of the history of textiles and fashion of\nthis region.\n\n\nAfter the Second World War, Java no longer claimed monopoly over the\nexport of batik.\n\n\nAs early as the first decade of this century, weavers and dyers in\nTrengganu and Kelantan of east coast Malaysia were experimenting with cap\nbatik with carved wooden blocks to make cheaper clothing materials for the\ngeneral rural population.\n\n\nConfronted by the rise of other regional fabric production, Javanese\nbatik development went through an interesting phase during which Indonesian\nnationalism brought batik back into the realm of statecraft and identity\nformation, as in the 17th century Mataram.\n\n\nDesigning batik patterns, packaging batik under brand names,\ntailoring batik into western-style garments and household product are traits\nthat led the batik industry towards the internationalisation of a traditional\nfabric.\n\n\nParallel to these new developments, small scale cottage industry\ncontinued to support the demand of local markets.\n\n\nIn recent years screen printing of batik patterns on either cotton or\nsynthetic fabrics has come into the market at cheaper prices, thus posing a\nserious threat to hand-drawn and stamped batik.\n\n\nOn the other hand, a number of small batik workshops along the\nPasisir have retired their cap, while continuing to make tulis batik.\n\n\nSome of these are meeting local demands, while others fill order from\nlarger batik export agents and design houses with fine quality batik.\n\n\nReproductions designs copied from old batik seem to be a popular\nthough costly trend developing in segments of the contemporary batik\nindustry.\n\n\nSome interpret and mix design elements with different fabrics and\nweaving techniques, for more variety and texture.\n\n\nContemporary batik seems to be enjoying a renaissance while working\nits way into the mainstream vocabulary of the international fashion world.\n\n\n Understanding Batik \n\n\nAs batik is most frequently used to decorate sarung and kain panjang,\ntwo basic garments worn in Java and most of the island world, the motifs and\npatterns are composed to be viewed when worn on the body.\n\n\nFor example, the width of the kepala of a sarung is measured to\noccupy either the front or the back of the wearer, while the badan\'s length\nis calculated so that after folding, it forms the counterpart of the kepala\non the wearer\'s body.\n\n\nThe uniformity of the colours that appear on a cloth is important.\n\n\nThis quality is best achieved by dyeing, whereby the entire fabric\nwaxed with patterns, is dipped in a dye bath to absorb the dye.\n\n\nIt is different from applying the dyes with a brush as in painting.\n\n\nUnrestricted by the mechanical construction of patterns on weavings,\nbatik gives ample space for creativity.\n\n\nInsofar as pattern-building is concerned, batik is similar to\npainting, where inspirations from all sources can be instantly translated\nonto the white cloth; while the dyeing and the eventual completion of the\ncloth is as regular as any textile dyeing.\n\n\nAs a dyeing technique, batik nonetheless provides ample flexibility\nfor the makers to create a wide range of motifs.\n\n\nThese motifs may be derivations of objects of very different media -\nwoodcarvings, ceramics, embroideries, weaving patterns, as well as basketry;\nwhile some may be expressions of aesthetic or visual concepts, as of the\nfigurative renderings found on altar hangings ( tokwi), Dutch compagnie batik\nas well as the famous sea animal and Indramayu batik.\n\n\nPatterns on batik, whether generated by canting or by cap are seldom\nidentical, for there are so many possibilities for mixing and matching motifs\nand colours. \n\n\nOne motif can be interpreted in many different ways by varying the\nsize and colour, by adding minor decorative details, by combining motifs or\ndesign elements and through the different technical accomplishments of the\nindividual batik-makers.\n\n\nThe classic example to illustrate the dynamics of batik motifs is\nthe parang rusak motif.\n\n\nDecreed by the rulers of the central Javanese kingdoms of Surakarta\n( Solo) and Yogyakarta in the 18th century as a " forbidden" motif members of\nroyalty, the parang generic is the generic name for a group of diagonal\nmotifs ( garis miring) containing at least 30 variations.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

Ho Kong Chong\n\n\nValerie Lim Nyuk Eun\n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n\nBack alleys in Singapore are disappearing from the urban environment\nbecause they are part of the shophouse architecture of the old, densely\nsettled central city area that is rapidly giving way to new office complexes\nas a result of urban, renewal, initiated in the mid sixties.\n\n\nThis architecture grew up around a mode of economic organisation,\nwhere the same premise typically combined both work and domestic activities,\nand where business was very much a family affair ( Teo and Savage, 1985: 53).\n\n\nWhile social and architectural aspects of shophouses hag been\nanalysed ( eg Kaye, 1960: 4585; Foong, 1973; Kohl, 1984: 171-86), the\nbacklanes of these shophouses have been ignored altogether.\n\n\nYet the backlane is not a trivial oddity, but is significant\nhistorically and sociologically.\n\n\nThis essay attempts to trace the origins of the backlane development\nscheme by the Singapore's municipal government as an early urban improvement\nprogramme and the factors which led to its abandonment.\n\n\nThroughout the essay, the backlane will be conceptualised as a\ncontested region.\n\n\nThe nature of this contest, however, changes with the history of the\nalley.\n\n\nIn the evolution phase, it involved authorities wanting to drive\nalleys through the backs of shophouses in the congested Central Area in order\nto provide light, air and drainage, and owners wanting to retain the space\nthat would otherwise be given up for backlane construction.\n\n\nIn the subsequent colonialisation phase, the contest involves private\ninitiatives at encroaching what is essentially public space.\n\n\nConcepts developed by Goffman ( 1959) and Suttles ( 1972) will be\nused in the analysis of the process of colonisation of the alley.\n\n\n THE EVOLUTION OF THE BACKLANE SCHEME \n\n\nThe continued development of entrepot trade in Singapore under a\nlaissez faire colonial municipal authority created a nation of shophouses,\ntightly packed in the city core.\n\n\nA brief history of this is given in the the 1947 Report of the\nHousing Committee ( 1948: 5).\n\n\nThe shophouse is the most popular type of building in Singapore.\n\n\nFor the last 100 years Singapore has been a city of shophouses.\n\n\nThe original subdivisions made in the early days of Singapore to\naccommodate residential property, ie large compound houses, were subsequently\nsubdivided into lots of about 16 feet wide and of depth up to 200 feet,\nutilising to the maximum advantage the existing road frontages, making no\nprovision for rear access.\n\n\nThe result has been that buildings have been erected in the last 100\nyears on these lots covering the whole area except small openings which were\noriginally meant for airwells, but which in overcrowded conditions have\nbecome mere flues for cooking and general purposes, and in some cases\ncompletely roofed over.\n\n\nThat there was no rear access indicated that backlanes was not part\nof the original plan of shophouses, as one might have mistakenly assumed.\n\n\nIndeed, while shophouses had already become the major commercial and\ndwelling form by mid 1800s, backlanes were constructed much later, with the\nrecommendation of one man, WJ Simpson.\n\n\nBy the early 1900s, the decades of rapid urbanisation and population\ngrowth had caused the problems of congestion and sanitation to reach such\nproportions that authorities had to act in a decisive manner.\n\n\nIn 1907, Simpson was invited by the government to study the health\nand sanitary conditions in Singapore.\n\n\nHe ( 1908: 29) pointed out that the overcrowding of areas with houses\nand, in turn, overcrowding of house with inhabitants were 'two well known\ncauses of high death rates, and the remedy lies in the removal of the causes\nin the old localities and their prevention in the new and in these parts of\nthe old not yet overbuilt on.\n\n\nTheir prevention can be secured by stopping at once the erection of\nhouses without back lanes'; as one of the causes for poor sanitary conditions\nwas 'the absence of back lanes and open yards to allow of drainage,\nscavenging and a free circulation of air' ( 1908: 28).\n\n\nConsequently, he ( 1908: 30) recommended the general principle that 'houses\nconstituting each section of a block shall have at their rear a lane not less\nthan 15 feet, and not more than 20 feet wide for the purposes of scavenging\nand drainage').\n\n\nThis was adopted by the colonial government in section 2(2) of the\nImprovement Ordinance and 148 of the Municipal Ordinance ( Chapter 133,\n1913).\n\n\nThe backlane issue received prominent attention once again, 10 years\nafter the Simpson Report, when a housing commission was set up to analyse the\ndeteriorating housing situation.\n\n\n'As the buildings are in back to back rows, the only ingress and\negress is through the front.\n\n\nNot only must all the house and kitchen refuse and the cleaning of\nthe latrines be therefore carried out through the front door, but the\ndrainage and sewage work has to pass throughout the length of the house to\nthe front.\n\n\nIt must be remembered that some of these houses have 200 inhabitants,\nwith kitchens bathrooms and latrines on every floor; that the kitchens,\nlatrines and bathrooms are within a few feet of one another; that the\ncontents of the latrines are removed in a bucket by a coolie; and that the\nhouse drain into which all liquid matter flows is often in bad repair.\n\n\nIt is impossible for the coolie to resist the temptation of pouring\naway some of the urine into the surface drain.\n\n\nBut even if he were to carry away all the solids and liquid found in\nthe latrine, yet, owing, to the latrine pails being cleansed at the time and\nthe washings poured into the surface drain, it would not do away with the\nstench arising from the cleansings or prevent the surface drains from\nbecoming open sewers.\n\n\nThe nuisance created during these operations has, on occasions,\nbecome so accentuated on sultry nights that it has awakened people from their\nsleep in buildings where they were being carried out.\n\n\nThe smell of fecal matter and urine is very strong in Singapore.\n\n\nNot only in a large number of the houses, but also in the morning in\nthe streets' ( 1918 Housing Commission vol I, A62, para.\n\n\n8, 9).\n\n\nThe 1918 Housing Commission ( 1918: A48) concluded that the\nconstruction of backlanes is 'the most important scheme of all, one that will\nbe most used', thus reinforcing Simpson's recommendation.\n\n\nFinally, the continuity of the backlane scheme was ensured when Mr\nWilliam Bartley became Chairman of the Singapore Improvement Trust in 1931.\n\n\nUnder Bartley, the policy of the Trust was directed to an\nintensification of the backlane programme which was considered to be the 'best\nmeans of opening up insanitary blocks of back to back houses to light, air\nand municipal services' ( SIT, 1948: 10).\n\n\nBetween 1910 and 1947, an estimated total of 252 backlanes were\nscheduled for construction by the Municipal Government.\n\n\nTable 1, compiled from two sources, gives the general location of\nthese backlanes.\n\n\nIt is apparent that backlanes are concentrated particularly in\ndistricts 1 and 2 or the Chinatown area as well as in District 7 which\nencompasses Kampong Glam and district 8 which includes Little India and the\narea between Serangoon Road and Jalan Besar.\n\n\nAbout 69 percent of the backlanes built are found in these three\nareas.\n\n\nThe Simpson Report ( 1907) was, therefore, of significance because it\noutlined a particular course of action, which when adopted, was to influence\npolicy decisions for the subsequent 30 years.\n\n\nThe backlane solution, an onsite strategy for dealing with urban\nproblems, was to take precedence over alternative solutions, such as public\nhousing.\n\n\nPublic housing provision, for example, was raised as a means of\neasing Central Area congestion in by the 1918 Housing Commission.\n\n\nPresident: Supposing that there were a City Improvement Trust in\nSingapore and that it had powers for the compulsory acquisition of land for\nthe purpose of developing that area, would this be a suitable area for the\nImprovement Trust to buy the whole block up compulsorily and then lay out\nroads and then dispose of the land?\n\n\nMr B Ball(3): No.\n\n\nI do not think that a public body should be put to the expense and\ntrouble of buying up that land and developing it(1918 Housing Commission, vol\n2, para 752).\n\n\nInstead of new housing provision, municipal efforts at solving the\ncongestion and sanitation problems of the crowded Central Area was focused on\non-site solutions.\n\n\nThe perceptions of officials faced with the task was that backlane\nconstruction was the only solution. \n\n\nTABLE I General Location of Backlanes.\n\n\nPeriod Constructed Location

Location listed cannot be found\nin the present road directory. \n\n\nMr Braddell: It would be impossible would it not, in respect of these\nblocks of built-over land in Chinatown, these back to back houses, to improve\nthem in any better way than by driving backlanes through them?\n\n\nThe only improvement in Chinatown would be to open it up and drive\nbacklanes through it?\n\n\nMr B.\n\n\nBall: That is so.\n\n\n( 1918 Housing Commission, vol 2, para 832).\n\n\nThe construction of backlanes therefore became one of the major\nprogrammes in on-site urban upgrading and was promoted with great enthusiasm\nup to the period before World War II.\n\n\nReferences to this scheme was often couched in colourful terms.\n\n\nIf the Health Officers were to succeed in the fight which they were\ncarrying on with sickness and disease in the city of Singapore, it would not\nbe expected that they would do so without this provision.\n\n\nThe enemy with which they fought found shelter in the impenetrability\nof these dark and unopened places.\n\n\nThe enemy could only be reached by the power of light and air, and to\ndislodge him, it was necessary to drive backlanes through these haunts ( 1918\nHousing Commission, vol 1: A70, para 38).\n\n\nHowever, in spite of being the major urban policy of its day, several\nproblems encountered in its implementation were to eventually lead the\nauthorities to abandon the backlane scheme itself.\n\n\n PROBLEMS OF IMPLEMENTATION \n\n\nFirst, a problem that the authorities faced from the beginning was\nthe actual implementation of the scheme.\n\n\nAs shophouses in the Central Area were built back to back, the\nopening of backlanes would involve cutting through the backs of the affected\nhouses, taking up to about 20 to 30 percent of the land.\n\n\nOften, the size of the land had to be increased because of the need\nto align the backlane.\n\n\nA major implementation issue was, therefore, the level of\ncompensation to affected house owners for both the land and the cost of\nremodelling the houses.\n\n\nHence, the 1918 Housing Commission ( 1918: vol I, A10, para 38) noted\nthat: 'from 1907 to 1913, very little was done to make lanes in the Congested\nArea.\n\n\nThe reason was that the cost of compensation both under the 'back\nlane' section and under the 'Reconstruction' part was not only extremely high\nin itself by reason of the value of the properties affected, but was made\nprohibitive by the extravagant demands of the proprietors under the sections\nof the Ordinance dealing with the compensation'.\n\n\nFaced with high compensatory costs, the municipal authorities\nresorted to reducing the financial burdens by imposing a backlane requirement\non plans submitted for quite unrelated renovations, thereby absolving\nthemselves from any compensation.\n\n\nThis is revealed in the following testimony by Mr Seah Leang Seah, a\njudge, a member of the Chinese Advisory Board and a landowner.\n\n\nMr Seah: I am not against backlanes as a whole, but the Municipal Law\nis that when a man is going to put in a door or make any alteration and\napplies for a permit, the Municipality are not satisfied with the plan of\nthat particular part of the house, but want a plan of the whole property.\n\n\nThen they mark a red line across the backlane and say that if the\nproprietor wants to carry out his alterations, he must give up that piece of\nland to the Municipality without cost.\n\n\nThey do that even if he only wants to alter the front staircase.\n\n\nThe lawyers say 'You had better keep quiet. \n\n\nDon't improve'.\n\n\nMr Lornie: But do you get compensation, Mr Liang Seah, in these\ncases?\n\n\nMr Seah: No.\n\n\nMr Lornie: If the land is occupied by a building you do?\n\n\nMr Seah: If the Municipality intended to open up a backlane, and to\ndemolish a building for that purpose, then they pay compensation ( 1918\nCommission, vol 2, para 1974, 1978, 1979).\n\n\nThe effect of this approach on the landlords can be seen from the\ntestimony given by a landlord Mr H.\n\n\nSomapah.\n\n\nMr Elias: The only reason why the owner refuses to sign the plan (\nfor renovation) is because he is afraid that a backlane will be marked.\n\n\nMr Somapah: Yes that is the whole thing.\n\n\nMr Elias: He will not sign a plan for the opening of a window\nbecause if you take a plan for that, the first thing that is marked on it is\nthe backlane.\n\n\nMr Somapah: Yes.\n\n\nDr Finlayson: Then the owners are really the greatest\nobstructionists to the backlane scheme!\n\n\n( 1918 Housing Commission, vol 2, para 2541-2543).", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '86ca6e5a-f8f1-4d8e-994d-1be49f8fc982', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.696626+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': 'CHAPTER 2 \n\n\n Nation-Building in Singapore: An Historical Perspective \n\n\nChiew Seen Kong\n\n\n SINGAPORE IN THE 19TH CENTURY \n\n\nSingapore is a small island in the Malay archipelago.\n\n\nIt is situated at the southern tip of the peninsula of West Malaysia,\nto which it is linked by a short causeway.\n\n\nWhen Stamford Raffles landed on the island in 1819, there were only\nabout 120 Malay and 30 Chinese inhabitants.\n\n\nHe colonized the island and established it as a free port in order to\npromote trade.\n\n\nSoon Chinese from the southern provinces of China, Indians, Pakistanis\nand Ceylonese ( Sri Lankans) from the Indian subcontinent and Ceylon ( Sri\nLanka), and Malays from the surrounding Malay archipelago flocked here and\nthe population grew rapidly.\n\n\nBy 1836 the Chinese population had grown to 13,700 and outnumbered\nthe Malay population of 12,500.\n\n\nIn 1860 the Chinese recognizably became the majority group in\nSingapore as they constituted 61% of the population.\n\n\nIn mid-1989 the population of 2.685 million consists of 75.9%\nChinese, 15.2% Malays, 6.5% Indians and 2.4% others.1.\n\n\nWithout a police force or army and fearing ethnic conflicts, Raffles\nsegregated the various ethnic groups geographically, assigning the jetty and\nSingapore River areas to the Hokkien Chinese ( especially traders from\nMalacca) and the British so as to facilitate their businesses.\n\n\nThis policy led eventually to the formation of ethnic and sub-ethnic\nenclaves.\n\n\nIt made mutual understanding impossible and misunderstanding in turn\nbred much prejudice and stereotyping.\n\n\nThe early settlers in Singapore, whether Chinese, Malay or Indian,\nwere predominantly illiterate or semi-literate and poor.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the British and other European traders and\ncolonial administrators were wealthy and powerful, and no doubt, were likely\nto be looked up to as successful models for the poor Chinese, Malays and\nIndians.\n\n\nThe British aim was single-mindedly to make money by exploiting every\nopportunity available in Singapore and the region.\n\n\nThe Chinese and Indian immigrants were similarly motivated.\n\n\nThere were then many opportunities to create wealth in the new\ncountry created especially to promote trade.\n\n\nThis rapidly gave rise to occupational and trade specialization by\nvarious ethnic and sub-ethnic groups.\n\n\nThe British and other European and Hokkien merchants dominated\ninternational trade, the British and Indians were prominent in colonial\nadministration and public works, the Cantonese and Hakkas specialized in\nbuilding and construction, and the Hainanese in food retail.\n\n\nGradually disparity in income and wealth appeared and widened among\nindividuals and ethnic groups as some trades and occupations offered more\nthan others.\n\n\nThus slowly a plural society evolved with closely bonded ethnic\ngroups divided by culture, religion, language and social class.\n\n\nThese ethnic groups were also segregated geographically and socially\nas differences in language, religion and trade pulled them apart.\n\n\nThus the colony of Singapore was culturally, demographically and\npolitically an extension of Britain, Malaya, Indonesia, China and India as\nthese early settlers came to make money before returning to their homelands\nto be re-united with their families and fellow countrymen.\n\n\nThere was no social cohesion to bind these ethnic groups together.\n\n\nThey did not comprise a nation, and it was unlikely that\nnation-building instincts would arise from these competing and disparate\ngroups which felt no allegiance to this British trading colony.\n\n\n LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS FOR PLURAL SOCIETIES \n\n\nToday there are very few culturally homogeneous societies.\n\n\nDue to conquest, colonization, international trade, forced migration\n( slavery), voluntary migration, missionary activities and so forth, people\nof diverse cultures, religions and languages came to co-exist within the same\npolitical boundaries.\n\n\nThus plural societies are very common today.\n\n\nPlural societies can be divided into four major categories: those\nevolving due to ( 1) assimilation, ( 2) integration, ( 3) maintenance of\npluralism by coercion, and ( 4) disintegration.\n\n\nThese processes will be described below very briefly to provide\nSingaporeans with a broader perspective and understanding of Singapore\'s own\npattern of ethnic relations and its likely direction of change.\n\n\nCultural Assimilation: A One-Way Process The United States is an\nexcellent example of cultural assimilation with reference to its white-black\nrelations.\n\n\nAfricans were forcibly brought to the United States and sold as\nslaves more than two centuries ago.3 These African slaves came from different\nparts of Africa.\n\n\nThey spoke different languages, practised different customs and\nreligions.\n\n\nWorking mainly in the plantations in the south, they were culturally\nheterogeneous.\n\n\nUnder coercion they learned American English, dressed like American\nplantation workers, ate American food, and eventually practised Christianity.\n\n\nTwo parallel processes transformed these black peoples over several\ngenerations into black Americans: the gradual loss of their languages,\nreligions and customs, and the gradual assimilation of the culture of their\nwhite Anglo-Saxon Protestant plantation masters and other whites.\n\n\nIt was thus a one-way process.\n\n\nThese slaves became culturally white and today share little in common\nwith Africans.\n\n\nDue to their common experience of slavery, oppression by white\nmasters, and poverty after their liberation from slavery they developed a\nblack subculture which is still American and not African.\n\n\nAttempts to return to their African roots in the 1960s failed.\n\n\nCut off for so long from their cultural roots - being unable to speak\ntheir ancestral languages and unfamiliar with their ancestral customs and\nreligions - they cannot revive them as the basis for doing so is totally\nabsent.\n\n\nThat is, when assimilation has proceeded beyond a certain point when\na group has lost touch with its culture, it is not possible to revive that\nculture.\n\n\nDespite their cultural assimilation, black Americans were\ndiscriminated against by white Americans in terms of education, employment,\nvoting rights, housing and so forth.\n\n\nDue to such sustained discrimination in the past, black Americans\ngenerally have a lower educational attainment than whites, lower income,\npoorer housing, and are still often not accepted into clubs donated by\nwhites.\n\n\nIn short, cultural assimilation has not brought about social\nassimilation, i.e., equal status and social acceptance by the dominant\nwhites.\n\n\nThere are, however, many liberal whites and other ethnic groups who\nare sympathetic to the black Americans\' cause or desire for full equality in\nsociety, some of whom are active supporters of the black protest movements.\n\n\nCultural Integration: Processes of Fusion Africans were also sold to\nPortuguese plantations in Brazil at about the same as those sold to American\nplantations.\n\n\nInitially the Portuguese captured the Amerindians and forced them to\nwork in their huge plantations.\n\n\nThese Amerindians came from different tribes, spoke different\nlanguages and practised different customs and religious beliefs.\n\n\nIn short, they were culturally heterogeneous.\n\n\nThey hated sedentary work and their role as slaves and consequently\nwere low in productivity.\n\n\nThe Portuguese then turned to Africa for their source of labour,\nbringing African slaves over in large numbers since the average Portuguese\nplantation in Brazil needed about sixty workers.\n\n\nThe American plantations were small in comparison.\n\n\nPortugal had once been conquered by the Moors of northern Africa.\n\n\nThe Moors kept slaves but treated them as human beings with some\nrights.\n\n\nThe Portuguese had thus learnt about slavery from the Moors and\nfollowed their example.\n\n\nIn comparison, the Anglo-Saxon American plantation owners treated\ntheir slaves as property and as property, these slaves had no rights\nwhatsoever.\n\n\nIn Brazil, the Portuguese sometimes sent their skilled slaves ( e.g.\ncarpenters or blacksmiths) to work in the cities.\n\n\nThese slaves were permitted to keep some of their earnings while the\nrest was remitted to their masters.\n\n\nThus some of them could often accumulate enough to buy back their\nfreedom.\n\n\nOnce they reached old age, some Portuguese masters would free their\nfavourite slaves, an act considered a measure of social grace in Brazilian\nsociety.\n\n\nThus African slaves were treated very differently in the United\nStates and Brazil.\n\n\nPortuguese plantation owners also kept some of their female\nAmerindian and African slaves as " concubines".\n\n\nTheir offspring were often assigned an intermediate status between\ntheir white master-father and brown/black slave-mother as plantation\nsupervisors or domestic servants in the big house.\n\n\nSlowly such " miscegenation" produced sub-populations of mestizos and\nmulattos.\n\n\nAnd then mestizos and mulattos intermarried.\n\n\nGradually a wide spectrum of " colours" from white through shades of\nbrown and shades of grey to black evolved and Brazilians thus appear.\n\n\nBrazilian culture also emerges through this century-long evolution as\nPortuguese, Amerindian and African cultures, languages, customs, crafts,\narts, dances, and music slowly fused together.\n\n\nOf course, the Portuguese component is the dominant component in this\nBrazilian integration.\n\n\nThese cultural and biological changes took place unevenly in Brazil,\nwhich is a vast country, integration being somewhat more incomplete in the\nless developed, remote areas.\n\n\nToday, Brazil\'s constitution prohibits " racial" discrimination.\n\n\nBut ethnic prejudice is nevertheless still alive and is manifested\nchiefly in a preference for the fair complexion over the dark.\n\n\nIn Brazil, however, money or land " bleaches" - a rich man,\nregardless of his skin colour, is called a blanco ( white), i.e., the darker\nBrazilians are accepted socially by their fairer compatriots if they have\nsucceeded economically.\n\n\nPreservation of Pluralism by Coercion The Union of South Africa is an\nexcellent example of a plural society where pluralism is maintained by force\nto the advantage of whites.\n\n\nAbout 20% of the population consists of whites.5 Among them about 60%\nare of Dutch origin and the rest of British origin.\n\n\nAfricans of diverse tribal origins constitute about 70% of the\npopulation, while the Coloureds constitute the remaining 10%.\n\n\nSome of these Africans were historical enemies.\n\n\nAt the initial stage of inter-group contact, the Dutch colonials were\nconcerned about religious differences.\n\n\nWhen some Africans became Christians, there were some intermarriages\nbetween them and the Coloureds were produced.\n\n\nThen the World Wars brought racism to South Africa.\n\n\nThe British controlled the economy but the more numerous Afrikaners\nof Dutch origin soon dominated polities.\n\n\nFearing competition from the Africans and the Coloureds, the latter\neventually imposed apartheid policies designed to protect and enhance their\neconomic interests at the expense of the nonwhites.\n\n\nThe British cooperated with them.\n\n\nForce is used readily by whites to impose their dominance and sustain\na plural society of great inequalities between whites and non-whites in\nterms of political power, wealth, income, housing and education.\n\n\nIn the name of preserving their African roots, African children\nreceive an education indigenous in content in their tribal languages and are\ndenied an Afrikaner, modern education.\n\n\nThe tribes are residentially segregated.\n\n\nThe apartheid constitution also denies them well-paid skilled jobs.\n\n\nRestaurants and other public service organizations openly segregate\nclients into whites and non-whites who are served in the respective\nwhite-only or non-white areas.\n\n\nA Multi-Tribal Society Fragmented Nigeria in the 1960s exemplified\nthe difficulties of holding a plural, i.e., multi-tribal, society together.\n\n\nDue to differences in degree of urban concentration, in cultures,\neducational attainment and occupational specialization, inter-tribal\ndifferences gradually appeared in terms of political power, wealth, income\nand housing.\n\n\nThe political parties were predominantly tribe-based.\n\n\nPolitical contests thus became tribal conflicts.\n\n\nEventually, civil war broke out and Nigeria was split along tribal\nlines.\n\n\nThe armed forces then took control of the government and suspended\npolitics.\n\n\nA few years later the military government ordered the political\nparties to reorganize themselves into multi-tribal parties so that no single\nparty could be dominated by any other tribe.\n\n\nPolitical activity was resumed but soon the parties each became\nincreasingly dominated by one tribe and they began to espouse the causes of\ntheir tribal constituents.\n\n\nConflicts broke out and the military again took control.\n\n\nWithout military intervention, Nigeria would have disintegrated into\nthree smaller states, each representing one major tribe.6 Sri Lanka and\nNicaragua are recent parallel cases.7 The Nigerian example illustrates\npoignantly how fragile a plural society can be and how it can easily\ndisintegrate along ethnic lines.\n\n\nIt also illustrates how ethnic interests promoted without regard for\nthe mutual interests of the society in general, or for the legitimate\ninterests of other groups, can lead to inter-group conflicts.\n\n\nIn the end, all ethnic groups become the losers.\n\n\nModern-day domestic conflicts invariably invite outside covert or\novert intervention, which naturally complicates the already complicated\npolitical situation, often tending to prolong the conflict and make equitable\nresolution among groups extremely difficult.\n\n\n RELEVANCE OF THE ABOVE CASES TO SINGAPORE \n\n\nThese four cases show that the plural society of Singapore can\ndevelop in any one of the above four directions. \n\n\nIf assimilation is to be the long-term goal, then the culture of\nthe dominant group will be internalized by members of minority groups.\n\n\nThat is, the Malays, Indians and Others are expected gradually to\ndrop their own cultures and gradually to adopt the culture of the Chinese.\n\n\nSince Singapore is situated in the Malay archipelago, this\nassimilation option was already recognized by all the political parties in\nSingapore in 1955 to be a non-viable option, one which would invite Malay and\nMuslim intervention from outside the city-state.\n\n\nLikewise, if pluralism is to be pursued as a goal for maintaining\nthe dominant position of the Chinese in terms of political power, wealth and\nincome, the minorities are likely to seek foreign assistance in their\nresistance to Chinese domination.\n\n\nIf this were to happen, Singapore would be heading in the same\ndirection as Nigeria in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\nEconomic and other developments require a relatively long period of\npolitical stability in order to ensure investors and skilled workers that\nthey can make long-term plans with a minimum of uncertainty, especially for\nprojects with a long gestation period before capital or effort can be\nrecovered.\n\n\nThus, political instability will scare away capital and skilled\nmanpower and so inhibits economic growth.\n\n\nIt seems obvious that assimilation and the preservation of\npluralism are not viable options for Singapore.\n\n\nThe only choice that remains is integration as exemplified by\nBrazil and other Latin American societies where cultures fuse to varying\ndegrees.\n\n\nThe ultimate outcome will be a new, homogeneous culture and\nsociety.\n\n\nThe United States is also an example where the various European\ncultures have fused into an American culture where the Anglo-Saxon component\nis the dominant part of this hybrid.\n\n\nWhether it is assimilation or integration, the processes of change\nare bound to be painful to some individuals and groups in the short run.\n\n\nIf the pace of change is sustained by political will, a point will\nbe reached when it becomes very difficult to revert back since so much has\nalready been lost and forgotten, and when it becomes very easy just to move\nahead towards the ultimate assimilation or integration.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'CHAPTER 7 \n\n\n Searching For Singapore\'s National Values \n\n\nJon S T Quah\n\n\nThe purpose of this concluding chapter is twofold.\n\n\nFirst, we will evaluate the suitability of the four core values\nidentified in President Wee Kim Wee\'s address at the opening of the Seventh\nParliament as national values by discussing the implications involved in\ntheir implementation.\n\n\nSecond, we will then proceed to suggest a set of national values which\nwe hope will be acceptable to all Singaporeans, including not only a\nmodification of some of the four core values, but also two other values which\nhave not been stressed so far.\n\n\nNeedless to say, it is not possible for us to provide a comprehensive\nlist of all the required national values in this chapter.\n\n\nNor would it be wise for us to do so, as such a long list would be\nunwieldy and distract our attention from focusing on the key values.\n\n\nAccordingly, we have deliberately restricted our focus to six national\nvalues, which will help Singaporeans and their government to strengthen their\nnational identity as well as preserve the cultural heritage of the different\ncommunities.\n\n\n THE FOUR CORE VALUES \n\n\nIn his speech to the members of the Alumni International Singapore on\n11 January 1989, Brigadier-General ( BG) Lee Hsien Loong, the Minister for\nTrade and Industry, presented his personal views on the national ideology\ndebate and elaborated on the four core values identified in the presidential\naddress to parliament.\n\n\nThe four core values are:\n\n\n( l) Community over self;\n\n\n( 2) Upholding the family as the basic building block of society;\n\n\n( 3) Resolving major issues through consensus instead of contention;\n\n\n( 4) Stressing racial and religious tolerance and harmony.1 BG Lee\nasserted that these four values, which are the key values, " provide an\nadequate starting point for a National Ideology" because " they are\ncompatible with Chinese, Malay, and Indian cultures, and with the values\ntaught by the major religions".\n\n\n2) Indeed, these four values provide a useful basis for further\ndiscussion among Singaporeans regarding the components of the national\nideology.\n\n\nSeveral important qualifications made by him regarding these values\nshould be noted.\n\n\nThe first point of view to bear in mind is that the national ideology\nis " the characteristic ethos and spirit of a people" and consists of the\ncore values which the community shares, and which distinguishes them from\nother peoples and countries".\n\n\n3) In other words, the set of national values which we will identify\nfor Singapore should, as far as possible, distinguish Singaporeans from the\ncitizens of other countries.\n\n\nThe second qualification mentioned by BG Lee is that the national\nvalues should be non-political and non-religious in nature and should\nconsist of those personal values which Singaporeans must espouse to ensure\nnational unity.\n\n\nThirdly, he suggested a " conservative but not unquestioning\napproach" in shaping the desired national values for Singapore: " retain our\nown heritages, but examine them for values which need to be modified, and\nscrutinize foreign traditions for ideas which can be incorporated, but do so\ncautiously".\n\n\nA fourth qualification is that while the national values should be\nuniversal and not particularistic in nature, the set of national values to be\nadopted for Singapore should, nevertheless, reflect our special\ncircumstances.\n\n\nFinally, the list of national values should be kept to the minimum so\nthat we can focus on the key items.\n\n\n 4) EVALUATION OF THE FOUR CORE VALUES \n\n\nIn general, the four core values are accepted either in toto or with\nsome modification by the various groups which have made submissions to the\ngovernment.\n\n\nWe will discuss the suitability of these four values as national\nvalues in turn.\n\n\n Community over Self \n\n\nAccording to BG Lee, Oriental and Western societies differ in terms\nof the relative importance of the individual and the group.\n\n\n" In general, Western societies place more weight on the individual,\nwhile Oriental societies tend to place more weight on the group."\n\n\n5) In the same vein, George C. Lodge has contrasted the two " ideal\ntypes" of " individualism" and " communitarianism" in the following manner:\n\n\nIndividualism suggests an atomistic conception of society, one in\nwhich the individual is the ultimate source of value and meaning.\n\n\nThe interests of the community are defined and achieved by\nself-interested competition among many, preferably small, proprietors.\n\n\nCommunitarianism, however, takes a more organic view, regarding the\ncommunity as more than the sum of its individuals and requiring explicit\ndefinition of its needs and priorities.\n\n\n6) The need for stressing communitarianism or community above self as\none of the four core values is understandable in view of the excessive focus\non individualism in Singapore.\n\n\nIndeed, individualism has been emphasized usually at the expense of\ncommunitarianism.\n\n\nFor example, the system of meritocracy has, undoubtedly, contributed\nto the importance of education as a channel for upward social mobility in\nSingapore and the selection and promotion of the " best and brightest" in the\npublic sector.\n\n\nHowever, the focus on doing well in examinations, the emphasis on\npaper qualifications, and the special treatment given to the " scholar" civil\nservants have certainly reinforced the appeal of individualism among\nSingaporeans.\n\n\nAnother negative consequence of the " paper chase" has been the\nunhealthy dependence on private tuition and the spawning of a lucrative\nprivate tuition industry in Singapore.\n\n\nHence, the problem is not simply that of displacing individualism\nwith communitarianism, which would be quite a difficult task to achieve\nanyhow, especially in the short run.\n\n\nRather, the solution seems to be the attainment of an equilibrium\nbetween individual and community interests.\n\n\nIt would indeed be unrealistic at the present moment to expect\npragmatic Singaporeans to change their individualistic behaviour overnight,\nespecially when the reward system is still based on individualism rather than\ncommunitarianism.\n\n\nAccordingly, we propose that the core value of " community over self\'\nshould be modified to " harmony or balance between individual and community\ninterests" as this value would be more feasible in the short run.\n\n\nThe value of " community over self" can only be attained in the long\nrun after the reward system has been correspondingly modified to stress the\nimportance communitarianism over individualism.\n\n\n The Family as the Basic Institution \n\n\nIn their study, The Family in Various Cultures, Stuart A. Queen,\nRobert W. Habenstein and Jill S. Quadagno found, among other things, that the\nfamily is an important institution which performs four universal functions in\nvarious cultures, namely, procreation, orientation, division of labour\nbetween the sexes, and status giving.\n\n\n7) A more recent international study of seven countries has shown\nthat " the family ( whatever its form) remains a rather important aspect in\nthe life of individuals and of the community".\n\n\n8) Given the universal importance of the family, care must be taken\nwhen highlighting this core value to ensure that the government is not\nperceived by the minority groups to be only promoting the Confucian model of\nthe family as this will not be acceptable to the non-Chinese Singaporeans.\n\n\nIt is quite easy to make the mistake of stressing Confucian family\nvalues only specially when three-quarters of the population is of Chinese\ndescent.\n\n\nThe temptation to do so must be strenuously resisted otherwise this\ncore value would cause a wedge not only between the Chinese and non-Chinese\nSingaporeans, but also among Chinese Singaporeans themselves.\n\n\nIts utility as an unifying factor among Singaporeans would thereby be\ndiminished.\n\n\nIndeed, the various communities in Singapore consider the family as\nan important institution.\n\n\nFor example, the joint ( Ad Hoc) Committee of Muslim Organizations (\nJCMO) supported this core value in its " Communique on National Ideology":\n\n\nWe agree that the family is a fundamental unit of society.\n\n\nA happy, orderly and stable family unit is a prerequisite for a sound\nand stable society.\n\n\n9) Similarly, the Tamils Representative Council ( TRC) also accepts\nthis core value of the family as a basic institution of society.\n\n\nIn its " Submission on Core Values and National Ideology", the TRC\noutlined its stand on the family thus:\n\n\nThe family is the most fundamental social institution of the Tamil\nsociety.\n\n\nIt occupies a very important position as the intermediate point\nbetween the individual and the larger society....\n\n\nThe Family is also the bearer of virtues, values and social\nreputation; for a man\'s reputation or status in society is linked to that of\nhis family and to his own behaviour.\n\n\n10) The Eurasians also support this core value, which is part of\ntheir way of life.\n\n\nAccording to Victor F Olsen, President of the Eurasian Association in\nSingapore: We are convinced that the family unit is the core of any civilized\nsociety.\n\n\nIt is the social network to which the individual belongs.\n\n\nIt is the support base from which the individual draws strength in\norder to develop and excel and/or seek refuge and solace in difficult times.\n\n\nThe Eurasian community is extremely family-oriented.\n\n\nMost of our community activities involve and revolve around all\ngenerations of the family and it also extends to include all relatives who\nmay or may not even be Eurasians.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that the important role played by the\nfamily in nation-building was pointed out long ago by the Greek philosopher,\nAristotle, in his classic book, Politics.\n\n\nIn Book 1, Chapter 2 of Politics, Aristotle wrote:\n\n\nThe family is the association established by nature for the supply of\nmen\'s everyday wants, ....\n\n\nBut when several families are united, and the association aims at\nsomething more than the supply of daily needs, then comes into existence the\nvillage.\n\n\nWhen several villages are united in a single community, perfect and\nlarge enough to be nearly or quite self-sufficing, the state comes into\nexistence, originating in the bare needs of life, and continuing in existence\nfor the sake of a good life.\n\n\nIn the Singapore context, the family\'s important role in\nnation-building will be enhanced by promoting the core value of the family as\nthe basic institution in society.\n\n\nHowever, as pointed out by BG Lee, the importance of family ties\nshould not deteriorate into nepotism, given our tradition of clean and honest\ngovernment.\n\n\n Solving Problems by Consensus, not Contention \n\n\nThis core value implies that the incumbent government should rely on\nconsensus and not contention to solve problems facing the country.\n\n\nThere is a great deal of conceptual confusion among social scientists\nregarding the meaning of " consensus".\n\n\n13) For our purposes, we will simply define consensus as " shared\npublic agreement" among Singaporeans.\n\n\nThe first assumption underlying this value is that it is possible for\nthe government to avoid contention or conflict in dealing with national\nproblems.\n\n\nThis assumption appears to be unrealistic as it is not always\npossible to avoid contention or conflict when controversial policies or\nissues are being discussed.\n\n\nNevertheless, the government and groups in society should not resort\nto violence or force to impose their views on the populace if they wish to\nsolve problems by consensus.\n\n\nTo govern by consensus also assumes that the government is willing to\nlisten to the population and to consult them when formulating major public\npolicies.\n\n\nThe shift in leadership style of the political leaders from a\npaternalistic style ( 1959-84) to a consultative style ( after 1984) will be\nconducive for the promotion of this core value.\n\n\nHowever, these leaders should realize that one consequence of\ngoverning by consensus is that it requires time and that they would not be\nable to formulate and implement public policies as swiftly as they had done\nso before.\n\n\nIt should also be stressed that this core value should not undermine\nthe role of opposition political parties in Singapore.\n\n\nIndeed, in a democratic political system, opposition parties play a\nvaluable role when they are constructive in their criticism of government\npolicies and when they provide a credible alternative to the incumbent\ngovernment.\n\n\nAt the same time, however, the government must not ignore or neglect\nthe demands made by various groups and their adverse reactions to public\npolicies.\n\n\nRather, the government should assess objectively whether such demands\nare legitimate or not, and also ascertain the reasons for the negative\nresponses to its policies.\n\n\nCare must also be taken by the government to ensure that it does not\nsilence constructive dissent when it governs by consensus. \n\n\nIf constructive dissent is discouraged or penalized by the\ngovernment, Singaporeans will perceive the promotion of this core value as an\nattempt to perpetuate PAP rule.\n\n\nFinally, to govern by consensus and not contention, the government\nhas to consult Singaporeans when it wishes to formulate important policies.\n\n\nFor this method of government to work, two pre-conditions must be\nsatisfied.\n\n\nFirst, all Singaporeans, especially those who can contribute, should\ncome forward and provide constructive and honest feedback on government\npolicies as well as suggestions for improving such policies.\n\n\nIn addition to such channels as the forum page in the press and the\nFeedback Unit, the government has recently referred new parliamentary bills\nto select committees in order to give Singaporeans the opportunity to air\ntheir views on the proposed legislation.\n\n\nIf Singaporeans fail to play an active role in the consultative\nprocess, they cannot blame the government for not consulting them as they\nhave not made full use of the opportunities given to them.\n\n\nSecond, the government must take the exercise of consulting the\npeople seriously.\n\n\nIt must not be perceived by Singaporeans merely to be paying lip\nservice to consultation and dismissing feedback provided especially if such\nfeedback is negative.\n\n\nOne of the survey findings reported by Chiew Seen Kong in Chapter 5\nindicates that the majority of the respondents want to be consulted by the\ngovernment before policies are made but their perception is that the\ngovernment has not done so.\n\n\nThe political leaders should take note of constructive suggestions\non how to improve existing policies or to modify policy proposals before\nthese are implemented.\n\n\nFurthermore, dissenting views should not be rejected outright and\nwithout a thorough examination of their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\nIf there is overwhelming public opposition or resistance to a new\npolicy, the PAP leaders should attempt to ascertain the reasons for such\ndissatisfaction, and either modify its contents or re-examine the need for\nsuch a policy in the first place.\n\n\n Racial and Religious Tolerance and Harmony \n\n\nIn a multi-racial society like Singapore, the need for racial and\nreligious tolerance and harmony is axiomatic for without it, there would be\nracial and religious conflict, which would spell disaster for us.\n\n\nWhile the communal threat is not serious in Singapore today given\nthe absence of communal riots over the last two decades, it should not be\nforgotten that the road to nation building is a long and arduous one, and\nalong the way - many things can happen which can hinder progress.\n\n\nNo plural society like Singapore can be immunized from the threat\nof racial riots; but such a threat can be minimized if not eliminated when\nthere is also a strong sense of national identity to reinforce the racial\nharmony that already exists in Singapore.15 At the same time, the feedback on\nthis core value from various quarters has also stressed the need for\nunderstanding between the different races and religions in Singapore.\n\n\nIndeed, this value is the most important of all the four core\nvalues because it enables us to distinguish Singapore from Hong Kong, Japan,\nSouth Korea and Taiwan, which are basically more homogeneous societies.\n\n\nMoreover, the institutionalization of this value will help to\nminimize the potential for racial and religious conflict in Singapore.\n\n\nThe feedback on this core value also indicates that racial and\nreligious tolerance and harmony are certainly very important in multi-racial\nSingapore.\n\n\nHowever, many people feel that what is even more important is\nunderstanding between the different races and religions.\n\n\nIf there is genuine understanding among the various ethnic and\nreligious groups in Singapore, the likelihood of conflict among them would be\nreduced considerably.\n\n\nThus, it is very important that such understanding between these\ngroups be enhanced.\n\n\nSince the hallmark of a multi-racial society depends on how the\nminority groups are treated, the government should ensure that its policies\ndo not discriminate against such groups.\n\n\nThe existence of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights and\nthe meritocratic system in the public bureaucracy serve to minimize racial\ndiscrimination in the public sector.\n\n\nOn the other hand, much more effort needs to be made to reduce\nracial and other forms of discrimination in the private sector.\n\n\nIf minority groups feel unwanted and suffer from discrimination,\nthey would not hesitate to leave Singapore, and many of them, especially the\nIndians and Eurasians, have already done so.\n\n\nThe recent White Paper on Maintenance of Religious Harmony\nhighlights the need to ensure that the various religions in Singapore, while\nenjoying freedom of worship, respect each others\' rights and do not attempt\nto convert members of other religions.\n\n\nThe rationale for the new proposals was clearly stated in the White\nPaper: Singaporeans belong to different races, languages and religions....\n\n\nIn such a context, religious and racial harmony are not just\ndesirable ideals to be achieved, but essential conditions for our survival as\none nation....\n\n\nWe therefore cannot assume that religious harmony will persist\nindefinitely as a matter of course....\n\n\nTwo vital conditions must therefore be observed to maintain\nharmony.\n\n\nFirstly, followers of the different religions must exercise\nmoderation and tolerance, and do nothing to cause religious enmity or hatred.\n\n\nSecondly, religion and politics must be kept rigorously\nseparated.16 In short, understanding, tolerance and harmony between the\ndifferent races and religions in Singapore is a sine qua non for its survival\nas a nation.\n\n\nSingapore\'s rapid economic growth during the post-independence\nperiod has been the result of its political stability, which can be\nattributed in turn to the absence of racial or religious conflict during the\nlast 20 years.\n\n\nIndeed, the absence of such conflict in recent years should not\nmake us complacent or forget about the fragility of our racial and religious\nharmony.\n\n\nOn the contrary, steps should be taken by the government and all\nSingaporeans to increase further the understanding, tolerance and harmony\nbetween the various races and religious groups in Singapore.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a6ba60f2-bea5-49c9-9dfe-28b1efa6c977',

{'text': 'POLITICAL CONTESTATION IN SINGAPORE \n\n\nLee Boon Hiok\n\n\nNational University of Singapore\n\n\nThis paper examines the nature of contestation in Singapore from the\nhistorical and contemporary perspectives.\n\n\nMy definition of the term " political contestation" is limited to a\ndiscussion of political party contestation in the legitimate political arena.\n\n\nThe analysis focuses on the experience of political parties and party\nsystems and the nature of contestation, and its consequences to the society\nand political system.\n\n\nA major thesis of this paper is that political contestation in\nSingapore has been influenced crucially by a number of historical and\nenvironmental variables.\n\n\nThe analysis suggests that political contestation can be understood in\nthe context of the Singapore government\'s attempt over the years towards\nobtaining a broad-based and a more unitary consensus in the realm of\npolitics.\n\n\nMoreover, the PAP government\'s institutionalization of its power,\nsince 1959, with the major political, economic and social structures in\nSingapore society has created a situation where opposition parties are unable\nto mount a meaningful challenge to the PAP\'s authority and rule.\n\n\nThe Making of the One-Party Dominant System Observers of Singapore\'s\npolitical life have described the political party system in slightly\ndifferent ways.\n\n\nSome observers call it a " dominant party system" or a " dominant\none-party system," while others have have mistakenly described it as a one\nparty system.\n\n\nMore recently, Chan Heng Chee has argued after Giovanni Sartori, that\nin the era of the 1980\'s, the label " hegemonic party system"\' is more apt in\nview of developments in 1 Chan Heng Chee, " Political Parties," in Jon ST\nQuah, et al., eds., Government and Politics of Singapore ( Singapore, Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1985), p.\n\n\n146.\n\n\nthe political arena.\n\n\nChan suggests that this is because the PAP has been the ruling party\nsince 1959 and the likelihood is that it will remain in power for the\nforeseeable future.\n\n\nAlthough other political parties exist in Singapore, none " possesses\na realistic prospect of attaining power in an open election since the\nhegemonic party makes no provisions for defacto competition on an equal\nbasis".2 Our characterization of Singapore is that of a one-party dominant\nsystem.\n\n\nIn such a political system, one party dominates the legislature and\nmuch of political life.\n\n\nThe existence of either parties is tolerated, but they tend to be\nweak and ineffectual, often becoming ( barely) visible just before\nelections.3 This is a more simple and less complicated description of the\nSingapore party system and allows us flexibility for greater elaboration on\nthe concept.\n\n\nWhat are the factors which have caused the emergence of the one-party\ndominant system in Singapore?\n\n\nA major factor is the PAP\'s consolidation of its institutional\nposition in politics and almost all aspects of Singapore life since it first\ncame to power in 1959.\n\n\nThe PAP has consolidated its hold on Singapore by developing and\ninstitutionalizing channels of influence over important structures in society\nsuch as the civil service, statutory boards, government-owned companies,\ngrassroots institutions and the trade unions.\n\n\nThe civil bureaucracy and the government-owned companies have been\nutilised by the PAP government for the implementation of its policies.\n\n\nThe growth of these structures over the years and their impact on\nSingapore life have been described extensively elsewhere.4 What is relevant\nfor our analysis is the fact that these administrative elites have developed\na close symbiotic relationship with the political leadership.\n\n\nIn fact, the civil bureaucracy is often an important resource base\nfor future political leaders.5 Such a close relationship makes it difficult\nfor the opposition parties to draw on the resources of a large and efficient\nbureaucracy to promote their political and electoral objectives.\n\n\nThe PAP government has also developed and institutionalized channels\nof influence with the key grassroots institutions in Singaporean society.\n\n\nThey are the People\'s Association ( PA) which runs the Community\nCentres ( CCs), and the related Community Centre Management 2 Ibid.\n\n\np.\n\n\n147.\n\n\n3 Lee Boon Hiok, " Political Institutionalization in Singapore," in\nRobert A Scalapino, et al., eds., Asian Political Institutionalization (\nBerkeley, University of California, 1986), pp.\n\n\n205-206.\n\n\nThis was also Chan\'s original description in, The Dynamics of One\nParty Dominance: The PAP at the Grassroots ( Singapore, Singapore University\nPress, 1976).\n\n\n4 See Seah Chee Meow, " The Civil Service," and Jon ST Quah, "\nStatutory Boards," in Quah, op. cit., pp. 92-119 and 120-145.\n\n\n5 Lee, op. cit., pp. 210-215.\n\n\nCommittees ( CCMCs).\n\n\nAnother set of grassroots institutions are the Citizens\' Consultative\nCommittees ( CCCs) that allow for citizens\' participation in community\nactivities, which are also utilized as a feedback mechanism by the ruling\npolitical elite.\n\n\nOf more recent vintage are the Residents\' Committees ( RCs) set up\nfirst in October 1977 to assist the Housing and Development Board ( HDB) "\nresidents to settle into their new environment and hasten the process of\ncommunity bonding particularly since old community networks had been\ndisrupted."\n\n\n6 Research on the grassroots institutions have stressed the pivotal\nrole of the PAP Member of Parliament ( MP).\n\n\nThere are many PAP leaders who believe that grassroots institutions\nshould be distinctly pro-party.\n\n\nThere is the view that the PAP branch should be the " catalytic agent\nin the mobilisation of the people in the constituency and that active members\nof the branch have to maintain close links with the other para-political\ninstitutions in order to ensure that all work is in complete unison towards\nthe common objective of political consolidation."\n\n\n7 In fact, before a general election or by-election, grassroots\nleaders may be seen to be working actively with PAP activists, and a number\nof these leaders may be PAP members.\n\n\n8 At this point it is appropriate to review the historical record of\npolitical party contestation in Singapore.\n\n\nSuch a history, of course, centres around the PAP\'s development and\nconsolidation of its power in Singapore.9 On paper, the PAP\'s record is\nimpressive.\n\n\nThe party was formed in 1954 and has been in power since 1959, when\nit won 43 of the 51 seats in the Legislative Assembly.\n\n\nIn the four general elections between 1968 and 1980, the PAP won all\nseats in Parliament each time with total votes cast ranging from 69 percent\nto 84.43 percent.\n\n\nIn the Anson by-election of October 1981, however, an opposition\nparty member, JB Jeyaretnam of the Workers\' Party ( WP), was elected into\nParliament for the first time in fifteen years.\n\n\nIn the December 1984 general election, the PAP won 77 of the 79\nparliamentary seats and out of these, 30 PAP candidates had been returned\nunopposed on nomination day.\n\n\nTwo opposition candidates were returned for the first time in general\nelections since 1968.\n\n\nThey were JB Jeyaretnam-6 Chan Heng Chee, " The Local Political\nSystem and Community Development in Singapore,", Paper presented at

1980 to 62.9 percent in the general election.\n\n\nIts share of valid votes cast ( not counting the spoilt votes)\ndropped from 77.7 percent to 64.8 percent.10 Recently, in the September 3,\n1988 general election, the PAP won 80 out of the 81 seats in Parliament.\n\n\nIts share of the valid votes cast was 63.1 percent a drop of 1.7\npercentage points from the 1984 results.\n\n\n11 In 1988, the PAP won 80 of the 81 parliamentary seats.\n\n\nA more detailed analysis of the 1988 general election results will be\nmade in the latter part of this paper.\n\n\nThe above figures do not tell much about the qualitative aspects of\nthe nature of political contestation in Singapore and the PAP\'s accession to\npower.\n\n\nInternal PAP historians and others have documented the PAP\'s early\nyears as an opposition party and its links with the communists and fellow\ntravellers in the United Front.12 The PAP was fighting against colonialism\nand the David Marshall and Lim Yew Hock governments.\n\n\nIn the early 1960s, the PAP was also involved in a fight for survival\nas left wing elements inside and outside the party made attempts to topple\nit.\n\n\nIn addition, during this period the PAP began to campaign and\nnegotiate for Singapore\'s merger with the proposed Malaysia.\n\n\nBy February 1963, the left-wing movement was effectively crippled\nwith the arrests of more than one hundred pro-Communist, political, trade\nunion and student leaders.\n\n\nOn September 1, 1962, Singapore residents in a referendum had also\nsupported the proposal for merger.\n\n\nThe country\'s removal from Malaysia in August 1965 allowed the PAP to\nfocus its efforts on building a new nation and to consolidate and expand its\nhold on the nation state.\n\n\nIf we focus on the historical record of the opposition political\nparties in Singapore it is clear that their role has been extremely weak for\na number of reasons.\n\n\nOne reason is that the PAP, as discussed earlier, has\ninstitutionalized its relationship with key institutions in Singapore\nsociety.\n\n\nThis makes it difficult for the opposition parties to draw on the\nvast resources of say, the civil bureaucracy and the grassroots institutions.\n\n\nThe reluctance of the PAP to allow opposition parties access to the\ndecision-making bodies of the grassroots institutions has historical roots in\nthe close struggle for political power with the Barisan Socialis in the early\nyears of the 1960s.\n\n\nIn constituencies which had voted in Barisan Socialis 10 Sunday\nTimes, December 22, 1984; quoted in Lee Boon Hiok, " Singapore in 1984: A\nTime for Reflection and a Time for Change," in Southeast Asian Affairs 1985 (\nSingapore, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 1985), p. 302.\n\n\n11 The Sunday Times, September 4, 1988.\n\n\n12 See the articles in Petir 25th Anniversary Issue ( Singapore,\nPeople\'s Action Party, 1979).\n\n\ncandidates, members of grassroots institutions were chosen by the PAP\ngovernment and their activities coordinated by the Prime Minister\'s office (\nPMO) and the PA.\n\n\n13 Again when the WP candidate, JB Jeyaretnam, won in the Anson\nby-election in December 1981, he was not made adviser to the grassroots\ninstitutions in his constituency as is normally the case.\n\n\nAfter Jeyaretnam was re-elected to Parliament in 1984, together with\nChiam See Tong, in Potong Pasir, the advisers to the grassroots institutions\nin Anson and Potong Pasir were the two defeated PAP candidates.\n\n\nAnother reason for the weakness of the opposition parties is that\nfrom 1965 to the middle 1970s, the PAP government applied severe legal and\npolitical measures to combat the emergence and growth of a credible\nopposition political organization.\n\n\nThe measures were often expressed in terms of the PAP government\'s\nsurvival ideology and the need to maintain political stability in Singapore.\n\n\nBoth the pro-communist and the non-communist elements in the\nopposition suffered from the measures.\n\n\nAfter 1965 " the PAP government feared the threat to Singapore\'s\nindependence posted by external interests and opposition parties came under\nconstant suspicion of being manipulated by such interests.\n\n\nInbuilt structural disadvantages for the effective organization of\nopposition politics dissuaded the educated and the professional elite"15 from\njoining the opposition parties.\n\n\nA final reason for the relative weakness of the opposition parties is\nthe PAP government\'s ability to deliver the economic and political goods.\n\n\nThe successes of the PAP in the economic realm do not need to be\nitemised, but together with these economic goods there was the production of\npolitical kinds of goods such as justice, liberty, peace and security.\n\n\nNo doubt many of the achievements come from the fact that the PAP had\nbuilt over the years a generally efficient and incorrupt public bureaucracy.\n\n\nThis administrative infrastructure has also been responsive to the\ndictates of the political leadership and the needs of the population.\n\n\nAt this point it may be useful to highlight the track record of the\nopposition parties to illustrate the above remarks. \n\n\nOn December 31, 1987 there were 21 registered political parties (\nincluding the PAP) in Singapore.\n\n\nThe opposition parties are the Alliance Party Singapura, the\nAngkatan Islam, the Barisan Socialis, the Justice Party Singapore, the\nNational Party of Singapore, the National Solidarity Party, the Partai Rakyat\n( Singapore State Division), the Parti Kesatuan Ra\'ayat ( United 13 Lee, "\nDecentralizalion for Development in Singapore," op cit, p 328.\n\n\n14 Ibid.\n\n\n15 Chan, " Political Parties," op.\n\n\ncit., p 163.\n\n\nDemocratic Party), the People\'s Republican Party, the Persatuan\nMelayu Singapura, the Pertubohan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura, the Singapore\nChinese Party, the Singapore Democratic Party, the Singapore Indian Congress,\nthe Singapore United Front, the People\'s Front, the Workers\' Party, the\nUnited National Front, the United People\'s Front and the United People\'s\nParty.\n\n\nSeveral observations may be made about these opposition parties.\n\n\nFirst, many of them are almost dormant between elections, coming\nalive just before a by-election or general election.\n\n\nEven then their participation in the electoral arena is in a token\nand not completely organised manner.\n\n\nSecondly, the major opposition parties have seen changes in their\nelectoral fortunes over the years.\n\n\nThis is particularly so for the Barisan Socialis which was founded\nin July 1961 as part of a left-wing breakaway group of the PAP.\n\n\nFor about ten years the Barisan Socialis was regarded as the most\nimportant party after the PAP, and in the general election of September 1963,\nit won 13 seats in the Legislative Assembly and 32.9 percent of the popular\nvote.17 Government action and internal party dissension in relation to a\nnumber of issues led to the party losing all the 10 seats contested in the\n1972 general election.\n\n\nThe dismal performance of the Barisan Socialis in general elections\nsince then, under its leader Dr Lee Siew Choh, indicates that the party " is\nclearly no longer an opposition force to be contended with and it is doubtful\nif it can maintain a presence much longer."\n\n\nThe WP has, since the eclipse of the Barisan Socialis, been the\nopposition party which has received the most attention in the politics of\nSingapore.\n\n\nThe party was formed in 1957 by David Marshall after he left the\nLabour Front government.\n\n\nIn 1963, Marshall left the party after a dispute over the Malaysian\nreferendum issue.\n\n\nThe WP was inactive until 1968 when it was the only party which ran\nin the general election.\n\n\nIn 1971, JB Jeyaretnam took over the party organization and brought\nin new members, some of whom were professionals.\n\n\nThe WP platform is essentially legalistic in nature and biased\ntowards the concerns of the English educated although its members come mainly\nfrom the working class.\n\n\nIn elections the WP has been a source of the protest votes against\nthe PAP.\n\n\nFor example in the 1972 general election, the WP fielded 27\ncandidates and polled about 12 percent of all votes cast.\n\n\n16 Republic of Singapore, Singapore 1988 ( Singapore, Ministry of\nCommunications and Information, 1988), p 228.\n\n\n17 Chan, " Political Parties," op cit, p 163.\n\n\n18 Ibid p 168\n\n\n19 Ibid, p 166.\n\n\nThe WP\'s progress in the political arena has, nevertheless, been\ncomplicated by poor organization, low finances and the legal problems of the\nleaders.\n\n\nJB Jeyaretnam was sued by the Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, for\ndefamation.\n\n\nIn 1978 the High Court found him guilty and ordered him to pay\nS&dollar;120,000 damages to the Prime Minister.20 In July 1986, Jeyaretnam was\ndisqualified from membership of Parliament when he lost his appeal in the\nHigh Court for false declarations of the WP\'s accounts.\n\n\nHe was fined\n&dollar;5000 and jailed for one month.\n\n\nUnder the constitution of Singapore a person is disqualified from\nbeing an MP if he has been sentenced to at least a year\'s jail or fined\nS&dollar;2000 or more.\n\n\nThe SDP, under Chiam See Tong, a lawyer, was registered in 1981 but\nChiam was politically active before that.\n\n\nIn the 1976 general election Chiam ran against a senior government\nminister, Lim Kim San, and won 11.1 percent of the popular vote.\n\n\nIn the Potong Pasir February 1979 by-election, Chiam acquired 32.4\npercent of the popular vote.\n\n\nIn the 1980 general election, Chiam gained 41 percent of the valid\nvotes cast.\n\n\nRunning under the SDP ticket in Potong Pasir, in the 1984 general\nelection, Chiam won by a majority of 3,454 votes.\n\n\nChan Heng Chee has astutely pointed out that the significance of\nthe " Chiam phenomenon is that the Singapore electorate clearly places an\nemphasis on formal attributes of education and training in their selection of\nrepresentatives.\n\n\nThat Chiam was not associated with a coterie of men who lacked\ncredibility, or with the familiar discredited opposition may have worked in\nhis favour."\n\n\n22 The Run-up to the 1988 General Election Despite the fact that\nthe PAP in terms of electoral seats had received an overwhelming mandate from\nthe voters in the 1984 general election, there was concern at the drop in the\nPAP\'s share of votes cast.\n\n\nAt this election, 1.54 million who were 21 years of age and above\nwere eligible to vote, and for the first time the electorate was dominated (\nover 60 percent) by voters who were aged 40 or below.\n\n\nIn fact, the number of new voters was about 215,000 and they were\nin the age group of 21-24 years.23 Lee Kuan Yew in an 80-minute press\nconference within an hour of the full election results acknowledged the\nreceipt of a clear signal from a significant portion of the young voters for\na more open and less austere government.\n\n\nDuring the press conference, Lee said that he was seriously 20\nIbid.\n\n\n21 For more details see, Wan Hussin Zoohri, " Singapore in 1986: A\nPolitical and Social Overview," in Southeast Asian Affairs 1987 ( Singapore,\nInstitute of Southeast Asian Studies, 1987), p. 277.\n\n\n22 Chan " Political Parties," op.\n\n\ncit., p.\n\n\n164.\n\n\n23 The analysis is partially based on Lee, " Singapore 1984," op.\ncit.\n\n\nthinking about changes to the one-man one-vote system.\n\n\nAsked what alternatives there were to the system, Lee said that he\nwas thinking of modifications to make sure the excesses were not carried too\nfar.\n\n\nLee observed that if there had been another 14 percent shift in the\nvotes, the combined opposition would have captured 40 seats and the PAP 39.\n\n\nLee\'s remarks indicated that in the future the PAP would be\nintroducing constitutional and electoral measures to change the nature of\npolitical contestation in Singapore.\n\n\nIt was also clear that, although the PAP government realized that\nsome of its controversial policies might have cost it some votes at the\nelection, it underestimated badly the extent of the protest vote.\n\n\nA letter to the press after the elections argued that the PAP did\nnot have sufficient feedback channels and that a centralized feedback\norganization be established for such a purpose.24 Another view argued that\nPAP leaders " have not quite got their fingers on the pulse.\n\n\nAlthough the signals have been sent, the PAP have not read them\naccurately."25 The PAP was sufficiently concerned about the election results\nto form a nine-man task force, headed by the party chairman, Ong Teng Cheong,\nto analyse the results.\n\n\nIn January 1985, the newly-appointed First Deputy Prime Minister,\nGoh Chok Tong gave the first hint that a formal mechanism would be introduced\nto allow consultation with the people on major issues which significantly\naffect their lives, before any decisions are taken.\n\n\nGoh said that such a system would give the public a forum so that\nthey can understand major policies better.26 In April 1985, it was announced\nthat a Feedback Unit would be created in the Community Development Ministry\nto open a fresh communication channel for the goverment to keep in touch with\nthe people.27 Research interviews and published reports indicate that the\npublic has been directing its views to the unit on a variety of matters.\n\n\nA senior Ministry of Development official said that " the presence\nof the unit has helped to reinforce what we learn from other sources, which\ninclude inputs from MPs, the grassroots bodies and letters to the press."\n\n\nThe town councils ( TC) concept introduced as a pilot scheme in\nthree sets of constituencies on September 1, 1986 was to have eventually a\nmore direct impact on the nature of political contestation in Singapore.\n\n\nOn paper the TC concept represents an innovative reform aimed at\ndecentralizing the decision-making process to encourage grassroots 24 Straits\nTimes, January 5, 1985.\n\n\n25 The Singapore Monitor, January 11, 1985.\n\n\n26 The Straits Times, January 19, 1985.\n\n\n27 For details see, " Decentralization for Development in\nSingapore," op cit, pp 330-331.\n\n\n28 " Feedback from a Ministry," The Mirror, March 1, 1986.\n\n\ndemocracy.\n\n\nThe plan was to tap the existing pool of political leaders and have\nthem help in the running of Housing and Development Board ( HDB) estates.29\nIn January 1987, the TC concept was linked to a proposal on Team MPs which\nwould represent an important change in the system of Singapore electoral\npolitics.30 Instead of the existing system of voting for an MP in each\nconstituency, voters in the three adjacent constituencies constituting a TC\nwould, under the proposed scheme, vote for a team of three candidates from\nthe various teams put up by the political parties contesting a general\nelection.\n\n\nThe team obtaining the highest number of votes would win the\nelection, and its three members will become MPs and be held collectively\nresponsible for running their TC.31.\n\n\nLim Boon Heng, the PAP MP for Kebun Bahru, gave two reasons for\nintroducing the Team MP proposal.\n\n\nOne reason had to do with the underlying message " that voters must\nvote wisely because they have to live with their choices."32 A second reason\nwas that it would help to improve the calibre of election candidates,\nespecially those from the political parties.\n\n\nAs the elected Team MPs are responsible for running their TC,\ncandidates for election must demonstrate " some form of administrative\nability if they want to get elected and run the town councils."33 The\nimplication here was that the PAP was insisting that future MP candidates\nmust possess certain abilities which were beyond the minimal requirements for\nrunning for political office in Singapore.\n\n\nIn February, 1987 Goh Chok Tong announced that the government would\nintroduce the plan in the next general election.\n\n\nLater in the year a third reason emerged for the establishment of\nthe Team MPs scheme.\n\n\nThis was the fact that the scheme now called the Group\nRepresentation Constituencies ( GRC) system would ensure continued minority\nrepresentation in Parliament.\n\n\nUnder the GRC system, candidates must contest in groups of three,\none of whom must be a Malay or a person from another minority group.\n\n\nThe disclosure of this reason by the government, added a racial\ndimension to the GRC debate, and in March 1988 there was a four-day public\nhearing of a Parliamentary Select 29 For more details, see Lee, "\nDecentralization for Development in Singapore," op.\n\n\ncit., pp. 331-332.\n\n\n30 Jon ST Quah, " Controlled Democracy, Political Stability and

the people know.\n\n\nFurthermore, the proposal that the President must agree to the top\nappointments in the civil bureaucracy and government-owned companies will\nprevent any government from

{'text': "Growing old in the Malay Community by Myrna L. Blake \n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\n Concluding Observations \n\n\nThe observations made in this final chapter focus on individual\nattitudes, and the family and community strengths which contribute to\nsuccessful adaptation to aging.\n\n\nAttention is paid also to the structural aspects of the community and\nto the points at which support breaks down so that the elderly Malay becomes\nvulnerable.\n\n\nWhile most of these observations are based on the respondents, namely\nthe current generation of the over sixties, speculations are also made about\nfuture cohorts of Malay elderly persons.\n\n\nFrom the data of this study, it appears that the present generation of\nMalay elderly accept, philosophically, failing health and minor physical\nailments which attend increasing age.\n\n\nSelf-dependence is important to the elderly person, whether this takes\nthe form of separate accommodation, independent income or the capacity to\ncontribute to the household in material or nonmaterial ways.\n\n\ncertain activities are seen as appropriate to old age.\n\n\nThe later years are viewed, in particular, as a time for prayer,\nother religious activities and family and close friends.\n\n\nThe younger generation perceives an older person as an essential part\nof a family without which a family unit is incomplete.\n\n\nThe senior person has special roles in life transitions of younger\nfamily members.\n\n\nEngagements and marriages, for instance, are events during which the\nspecial experience and knowledge of the elderly are called upon.\n\n\nOn the whole the Malay elderly in the present time are encircled by a\nwell-functioning family network which minimises the discomforts attending the\nprocess of growing old.\n\n\nThe low rate of Malay utilisation of public services reflects, to\nsome degree, a successful adaptation of the Malay family, to this stage of\nthe family life cycle.\n\n\nThe adaptation is largely dependent on family strengths, many\nexamples of which are revealed in the study.\n\n\nThe relationships of the elderly within the family network are\ncharacterised by interdependence, provided the elderly person is fit, mobile\nor has independent means.\n\n\nThe interdependence in family relations is demonstrated by the large\nnumber of Malays over 60 years of age who participate actively in functions\nassociated with maintaining the households in which their children also live.\n\n\nThe most valuable service provided by the fit elderly is that of\nchild care which frees the mother for work outside the home.\n\n\nIn this respect, a grandmother in particular, contributes in\nunrecognised ways, to the national economy.\n\n\nThis cloak of invisibility once attached to wives and mothers is now\nworn by grandmothers.\n\n\nIn return, the elderly parent receives shelter, financial\ncontributions from children, frequent visits if they live in separate\nhouseholds, and implicit assurance of acre when needed.\n\n\nAn important aspect of family adaptation to an elderly parent who\nmight eventually require care is the assumption that the task of providing\nthis care will fall mainly on the shoulders of a daughter, and the general\nacceptance of this task by a daughter.\n\n\nThis role is one aspect of nurturing other family members and\nmaintaining the home, which are expected of women.\n\n\nThe acceptance of this role by Malay women is clear in the high\nproportion of females who are housewives among the respondents' children,\ndespite the higher levels of education among women in that generation.\n\n\nThe preference of Malay parents for being in the care of a daughter,\nis linked to the belief that a daughter is more likely than a daughter-in-law\nto manja a parent, a belief that appears to be well-founded.\n\n\nThe daughter who undertakes the care of the parent does more than\nmanja.\n\n\nThe new responsibility sometimes means giving up a job, and re-\narranging her daily routine.\n\n\nHowever difficult the task of nursing an ailing or bedridden parent,\nthe daughters in this study, who undertook the tasks, found ways to cope, and\ndespite feelings of being burdened did not seriously consider abandoning the\nresponsibility or committing the parent to institutional care.\n\n\nFlexibility in the role of men also contributes to family strength.\n\n\nDespite their exclusion from household tasks during their earlier\nyears, several - though not all - older men seem prepared to involve\nthemselves in some household function after retirement.\n\n\nYounger men participate in nursing duties, especially those which\nrequire physical strength, such as lifting and carrying a bedridden parent\nfor bathing and other toilet needs.\n\n\nFlexibility of the younger male is also evident in the willingness of\nsome husbands to waive the traditional privileges that accrue to their\nposition as head of household, and to accept that priority be given to the\ncare of an elderly parent or parent-in-law.\n\n\nWithin the family circle the dependence of elderly parents is\naccepted by children even though the obligation of filial care is not\nexplicit in the process of their upbringing.\n\n\nThe older generation of Malays attribute this sense of responsibility\nto religious training through which proper values are inculcated.\n\n\nThe next generation hopes that the manner in which they discharge\ntheir responsibilities towards their parents will serve as models for their\nown children.\n\n\nWhile cultural values might generate the basic impulse to support\nparents, more tangible factors make this support feasible.\n\n\nGood health, not only of the elderly, but also of the 'carers' who\nare in their 50s or even 60s by the time their elderly parents begin to need\nspecial care, is one feature which reduces the potential burden that the\ndegenerative process can represent.\n\n\nMore salient, however, is the role of large families in facilitating\nthe care of parents.\n\n\nThe average number of children per parent in this generation of the\nMalay elderly is six.\n\n\nAssuming responsibility for a dependent parent becomes easier if the 'carer'\nhas siblings who will share some tasks.\n\n\nSharing may take various forms, namely, financial contributions,\nfrequent visiting, assistance in specific activities, nursing on a rotational\nbasis, or provision of respite.\n\n\nA second advantage of the large family is the increased chance that\nincludes a daughter who is able to undertake the care of a parent.\n\n\nOutside the immediate family, various forms of social relations\nsupplement family strengths in the Malay community.\n\n\nThe collective and individual responsibility towards the needy is\napparent, as the 'needy' includes the elderly especially if socially isolated\nand poor.\n\n\nThree forms of communal response are revealed in this study.\n\n\nThe first is the system of Zakat Fitrah, involving a mandatory\ncontribution by all Muslims.\n\n\nAmong other things, it functions as a mechanism for the\nredistribution of wealth, though the elderly reap the benefits only once a\nyear.\n\n\nThe second culturally determined response to need, less formal and\nmore dependent on individual motivations than the Zakat Fitrah, are the\npractices involved in the concept of sedekah.\n\n\nOut of this study emerged several examples of how the needy elderly\nMalay benefited from, and in subtle ways relied upon, this obligation of the\nmore wealthy towards the poor.\n\n\nThe third indication of the cultural sense of responsibility for\nthose in need is a form of patronage evident in the practice of 'adopting' an\nindividual.\n\n\nThis is demonstrated by examples of younger people who assume the\nrole of 'patron' of the older person, visiting, bringing food and other gifts\nand making financial contributions to the elderly person who has been 'adopted'.\n\n\nThe acceptance of the relationship by the older person is obvious in\nthe descriptor angkat ( adopted) attached to the relationship labels of anak\n( child) or cucu ( grandchild) used for the patron.\n\n\nThe relationships between the patron and the beneficiary are often\nlinked to childhood histories.\n\n\nIn addition to the responses to need, other features in the Malay\ncommunity add further strands to the social network of the elderly.\n\n\nAmong these are the semi-formal or informal groups that form\nspontaneously when Malays share a neighbourhood, and show similarities to\nassociations which mark pre-urban lifestyles.1 One example are the jawatan\nkuasa blok or block committees which emerge among the Malays who reside in\nHDB estates.\n\n\nThe second example are the groups which form on the basis of a common\nexperience, such as dependence on Public Assistance or on other social\nservices.\n\n\nThese function as useful reference groups as the shared status\nreduces stigma.\n\n\nThe groups also represent a means for mutual support, as the members\nbenefit from the sharing of tasks, information and expertise.\n\n\nOn the other side of the coin of family and community strengths are\nstructural features affecting the Malay community which set limits to the\nsupportive function of cultural ideals.\n\n\nFurthermore, there is ample evidence that various systems of support\nbreak down at certain points.\n\n\nIdentification of these points is important for deliberation of ways\nin which to ensure adequate security for the Malay elderly.\n\n\nDespite the inclination towards independence, some form od\ndependence, financial and/or for shelter, is fairly prevalent in this\ngeneration of elderly Malays.\n\n\nThe dependence stems largely from structural features including a\nhistory of low levels of education, low-wage employment and meagre retirement\nbenefits.\n\n\nEven if the Malay over 60 is able and willing to work in order to\nmaintain independence, opportunities for employment are limited, for most, to\nunskilled jobs for which the income earned is barely sufficient for\nsubsistence.\n\n\nSuch constraints are especially applicable to women, a high\nproportion of whom received little or no education.\n\n\nThe low wage of women is of significance to both sexes since, as this\nstudy indicates, several old old men depend upon the earnings of their young\nold wives.\n\n\nCommunal norms and ideals relating to family relations and community\nfunctions are subject to individual difference in any cultural group.\n\n\nVariations in individual personality and behaviour contribute to\nfamily dynamics and result in the strengthening or weakening of the family's\ncapacity to provide support for all its members.\n\n\nIn this study several variations were encountered.\n\n\nThe inadequacies in some families related to the absence of children,\nwhile in others, potential support for the elderly parent was eroded by\nstrains in interpersonal relationships.\n\n\nIt has to be concluded, therefore, that no community, whatever the\ncultural norms, can rely with confidence on family strengths for the\nprovision of all supports required for the processes of aging.\n\n\nCommunity association while softening the impact of life in a housing\nestate in Singapore for the Malay community have not sufficiently anticipated\nor responded to the needs of the elderly.\n\n\nThe benefits of spontaneous self-help groups are limited to the\nresources in terms of knowledge and expertise of the members.\n\n\nOther communal supports, such as channelled through the Zakat Fitrah,\nthe khairat kematian, the jawatan kuasa blok and the neighbourhood mosques,\ncontinue to function in traditional ways which tend to focus on social ills,\nsuch as poverty and specific family crises, mainly bereavement.\n\n\nSuch assistance is remedial and minimally supportive in the full\nrange of the needs of the elderly and the families upon whom they depend.\n\n\nThe narrowness of function of communal associations applies to two\ndimensions of the lives of older people - the opportunity to contribute to\ncommunity life and the accessibility of services.\n\n\nOpportunities for participation are limited by several factors.\n\n\nThe first is the priority given to high levels of energy and physical\nactivity associated with youth, thus easing out the elderly.\n\n\nActive participation is also frequently linked to the existence of\nprior social connections, thus the elderly person with newly-found disposable\ntime faces difficulties in finding a niches in establishing groups.\n\n\nMoreover, obtaining help often requires a certain amount of how-how,\nmobility and strength.\n\n\nIn these circumstances social isolation is perpetuated.\n\n\nIn community activities which are not specific to communal groups,\nthere are additional barriers to active participation of the Malay elderly.\n\n\nThese barriers relate to the language in which proceedings are\nconducted, and the feeling of exclusion experienced by people of a minority\ngroup.\n\n\nFurthermore, general community activities tend not to be responsive\nto the special minority needs, such as prayer times.\n\n\nThe effects of these various features of community groups are\ntwo-fold.\n\n\nFirst, the community as a whole fails to derive full advantage from\nthe potential of its elderly citizens.\n\n\nSecond, the disadvantaged and immobile elderly most in need of\nalternative social networks to substitute for families which are non-existent\nand weak, are not reached by community groups. \n\n\nThe current situation of the Malay elderly will be subject to\nchange, as are all aspects of life in Singapore.\n\n\nSince plans must be based on forecasts as well as analysis of the\npresent, attempts are made here to anticipate some possible features of the\nfuture.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'DIMINISHED RESPONSIBILITY ( With Special Reference To Singapore)\n\n\n\nby Kok Lee Peng,Molly Cheang and Chee Kuan Tsee\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\n Introduction: Overview \n\n\nPsychiatry is that branch of medicine which deals with mental\ndisorders.\n\n\nForensic psychiatry is defined simply by John Gunn ( 1976) as the\napplication of general psychiatry to people who are in one way or another\ninvolved in the legal process.\n\n\nSlovenko ( 1980) observes that the major part of it is concerned with\nthe assessment of and opinion on individuals with respect to the question of\ncredibility, culpability, competency, compensation and custody.\n\n\nThe subspecialty of forensic psychiatry is more often than not\nconfined to the examination and management of the mentally abnormal\noffenders.\n\n\nUndeniably, mental disorders can result in aberrant behaviour which\ncomes into conflict with the law.\n\n\nHowever that does not mean there is a direct link between crime in\ngeneral and psychiatric illness in general.\n\n\nThe mentally disordered person may commit a crime which has nothing\nto do with his mental condition.\n\n\nIt is worth remembering that mental illness or mental disorder is a\nbiological concept.\n\n\nCriminal behaviour however is a social concept determined by\nlegislation.\n\n\nEven so the causation of crime is very complex.\n\n\nIt is the interaction between the individual\'s intelligence,\ntemperament and personality make up on the one hand and his sociocultural\nbackground and life situation on the other.\n\n\n Conflict and Confusion \n\n\nPhysical illnesses or diseases are better defined and understood\nbecause there is generally a recognised etiology and a demonstrable\npathology.\n\n\nMental disorders on the other hand are the results of interactions\nbetween biological, psychological and social factors.\n\n\nMoreover the abnormal experience and behaviour produced are often\nsubject to individual interpretation and cultural beliefs.\n\n\nThe ordinary person has a very narrow concept of mental disorder.\n\n\nTo him mental disorder seems to mean only one thing and that is\nmadness.\n\n\nNot surprisingly therefore conflict and confusion frequently arise\nbecause the layman\'s idea of madness is not quite the same as the legal\nconcept of insanity which, again, differs from the medical term of psychosis.\n\n\nIn actual fact mental disorder is very common and includes various\ndisorders involving perception, memory, thinking, feeling and behaviour.\n\n\nSymptoms such as aches and pains, giddiness, weakness,\nbreathlessness, palpitations, poor concentration, forgetfulness, insomnia,\nappetite, weight loss, nervousness, irritability, social withdrawal, loss of\nnormal interest and not coping with routines, when prolonged and in the\nabsence of physical causes are examples of psychiatric problems.\n\n\nWhen psychoanalytical thinking became popular and fashion deviant\nbehaviour was given plausible explanation by being couched in\npsychopathological jargon.\n\n\nThus what was socially abnormal in the statistical sense became "\nmedicalised" into a mental health problem to be exempt from punishment.\n\n\nOn this kind of reasoning a dangerous conclusion could be reached: "\nHe is so bad that he must be mad." This led Menninger ( 1973) to ask "\nWhatever became of sin?".\n\n\nHowever it must be emphasised that explanation does not mean\nexoneration.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it has been considered appropriate to include a "\nsupplementary classification of factors influencing health states and contact\nhealth service" in the International Classification of Diseases edition ( ICD\n9) and a " V code for conditions not attributable to mental health disorders\nthat are a focus of attention and treatment" in Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - and its revised edition i.e.\n\n\nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third\nEdition-Revised ( DSM - III - R).\n\n\nMental Illness, Mental Disease, Mental Disorder " Mental illness", "\nmental disease" and \'mental disorder" have been loosely used interchangeably\nif not synonymously in clinical practice well as in writing.\n\n\nThis poses no problem in everyday life but medico - legal issues are\ninvolved, it could give rise to serious confusion and criticism.\n\n\nFor some psychiatrists however, even the existence of mental per se\nhas been challenged.\n\n\nClare ( 1986) was of the opinion that the " a tendency to disparage\nthe concept of disease and challenge its application to psychiatry".\n\n\nHe observed that historically there were two views of disease, one\narising from Hippocrates who envisaged disease as a combination of " signs,\nand symptoms observed to occur together so frequently and so\ncharacteristically as to constitute a recognisable and typical clinical\npicture", and the other, by Virchow who insisted that disease should be\nlocalised in the body as lesion.\n\n\nClare noted that Szasz ( 1974) used this concept of disease to negate\nthe existence of mental disease.\n\n\nDisease had been defined as a disturbance of the function or\nstructure of an organ or part of the body, and since the mind was neither an\norgan or part of the body, it could not be diseased, and consequently the\nconcept of " mental disease" would be incorrect.\n\n\nLewis ( 1953) in his influential paper on " Health as a social\nconcept" cautioned that mental disease should not be inferred from only a\ndeviant, maladapted, non-conforming behaviour.\n\n\nThere should be " impairment in psychological part-functions" like\nperception, learning, remembering, feeling, thinking, motivation, impulse\ncontrol.\n\n\nIn mental illnesses such as disturbance in part-functions occurred.\n\n\nThus Lewis took the moderate stand between the two extreme positions\nof psychiatry that mental illness was either non-existent, or that it existed\nin conditions that deviated statistically from the norm in the form of\ndeviant behaviour.\n\n\nIn physical disease emphasis is put on biological factors and their\nmanifestations.\n\n\nHowever the human person is made up of his biological or physical,\npsychological, social and spiritual attributes.\n\n\nTheir functioning and well-being are interrelated, interactional and\nintegrated.\n\n\nDisturbance in any one area will affect the rest of the individual\ncausing distress to the whole person.\n\n\nThe psychiatrist takes into consideration all these factors which may\ncontribute in different proportions requiring different approach and\nmanagement.\n\n\nThus at one end the condition may be obviously physical, organic and\nmedical while at the other end, it is just psychosocial and reactional or a\nproblem in living.\n\n\nThere is also a temptation, if not a tendency, to merge what is\nstatistically abnormal into what is pathologically abnormal.\n\n\nAs a result there is no general agreement as to the boundary of\nmental illness.\n\n\nSome psychiatrists would restrict its use to cover only the psychoses\nwhile others would extend it to include the neuroses or more.\n\n\nWith regard to mental disease, it seems to imply a more organic or\nmedical condition.\n\n\nHere again it is not easy to draw a clear line between what is\norganic and what is functional.\n\n\nThe trend now is to put all psychiatric conditions under the " mental\ndisorders" which include " psychoses, neurotic disorders, personality\ndisorders and other non-psychotic mental disorders, mental retardation, and\nother conditions that can give rise to psychiatric disorders or lead to\ncontact with psychiatric services" ( ICD 9).\n\n\nHowever the legal definition of mental disorder is not quite the same\nas the medical one, and in the English Mental Health Act 1983: " Mental\nDisorder" means mental illness, arrested or incomplete development of mind,\npsychopathic disorder and any other disorder or disability of mind.\n\n\n" Mental Impairment" means a state of arrested or incomplete\ndevelopment of mind which includes severe impairment of intelligence and\nsocial functioning and is associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously\nirresponsible conduct on the part of the person concerned.\n\n\n" Severe Mental Impairment" means a state of arrested or incomplete\ndevelopment of mind ( not amounting to severe impairment) which includes\nsignificant impairment of intelligence and social functioning and is\nassociated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on\nthe part of the person concerned.\n\n\nThe Act applied to the reception, care and treatment of mentally\ndisordered patients, the management of their property and other related\nmatters.\n\n\nTo qualify for most purposes of the Act the patient must be suffering\nfrom one of the four specific categories of mental disorder set in the Act -\nmental illness, mental impairment, severe mental impairment or psychopathic\ndisorder.\n\n\nPromiscuity, other immoral conduct, sexual deviance or dependence on\nalcohol or drug per se are excluded from the definitions of mental disorder.\n\n\nThe term mental illness is underfined and its operational definition\nand usage is a matter for clinical judgement in each case.\n\n\nIn the Singapore Mental Disorders and Treatment Act 1970 " mentally\ndisordered person" means any person found by due course of law to be of\nunsound mind and incapable of managing himself or his affairs.\n\n\nThe key words are " unsound mind" which is not defined.\n\n\nHistorically Singapore follows the Lunatic Asylum Act of India (\n1858) which was introduced in 1889.\n\n\nIn 1930 the word " lunatic" was changed to " person of unsound mind".\n\n\n Disease of the Brain and Disease of the Mind \n\n\nSometimes the terms disease of the brain and disease of the mind are\nbrought up in the court.\n\n\nDisease of the brain is normally the domain of the neurologist.\n\n\nBut as it can produce both physical and mental symptoms the\npsychiatrist becomes involved when the question of criminal responsibility is\nraised.\n\n\nThe court is interested to know whether the accused is suffering from\ndisease of the mind that causes defect of reason in the McNaughten Rules.\n\n\nIn practice, disease of the mind here refers to the psychoses whether\norganic or functional.\n\n\nPsychosis is phenomenologically a condition that is non -\nunderstandable and in which the sufferer is out of touch with reality and has\nno insight.\n\n\nTo put it in another way there is a breakdown of conformity,\ncommunication and control.\n\n\nThe individual\'s appearance, behaviour, conversation are beyond\nsocial expectation and acceptance.\n\n\nCommunication is difficult or impossible because of incoherence or\nirrational ideas.\n\n\nOften as a result of abnormal experience e.g.\n\n\ndelusion, hallucination or an inexplicable mood state, he loses\ncontrol of himself and behaves abnormally or out of character.\n\n\n Glossary of Mental Disorders \n\n\nDifferent countries may have their own diagnostic systems.\n\n\nThe Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (\nICD 9) by the World Health Organisation is perhaps the best known and the\nmost widely adopted for official uses.\n\n\nIn Singapore the Glossary of Mental Disorders of ICD 9 is adhered to\nin clinical practice and statistical returns.\n\n\nHowever the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders Third Edition or DSM-and the revised edition, Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition ( Revised) are also used\nunofficially.\n\n\nHowever it has to be pointed out that these manuals are more for\nclinical and research uses.\n\n\nOther factors have to be considered when applied to forensic cases,\nlike " individual responsibility, disability,

{'text': 'OCCUPATION AND CHINESE DIALECT GROUP IN BRITISH MALAYA \n\n\nMak Lau Fong\n\n\n Introduction \n\n\nFactors contributing to migration decision making in modern times are\nmuch more complex than in the early days when the primary motive to emigrate\nwas essentially economic.\n\n\nThis motive of improving on one\'s life chances can be expressed in\nterms of finding a job that would earn one a subjectively better living.\n\n\nThe formation, change, and persistence of the occupational patterns of\nimmigrants have naturally been a great concern in many studies on early\nimmigrants.\n\n\nEnquiries into Chinese immigration are no exception.\n\n\nEarly Chinese immigrants in North America exhibited a universal\noccupational pattern, because they were mainly slotted into residual\ncategories of occupations which were deemed menial and undesirable.\n\n\nWhile capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism well account for Asian\nmigratory movements before the Second World War, the host countries\' work\nenvironment, which was regulated by both labour market forces and immigration\nlaws, determined the type of job an immigrant held.\n\n\nContract labourers were left with no choice as to type of work and\nlocation of worksites.\n\n\nThe majority of Chinese contract workers recruited during 1861-70\nworked in gold mines, railroad construction, and later in plantation and\nfarming.2 Early voluntary immigrants and freed contract labourers were also\nnot gien any better range of occupational choice in North America.\n\n\nResearch findings consistently portray them as operators in\nbusinesses such as restaurants, laundry shops, and grocery stores.\n\n\nA Chinese immigrant\'s occupation was thus highly predictable, because\nof the limited range of occupational categories that were available to him.\n\n\nChinese immigrants to the British Straits Settlements were by and\nlarge of the same two categories: contract labourers and voluntary\nimmigrants.\n\n\nThe range of occupational choices for contract labourers did not seem\nto be much wider than that of their counterparts in North America, partly\nbecause the nature of capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism varied very\nlittle within a specific time period.\n\n\nThey were recruited chiefly as labourers to work in mining sites and\nplantations of many kinds as in North America where the immigrants\' former\nsettlements later developed into towns and cities, environs of worksites of\nthe Chinese immigrants were also transformed into urban areas.\n\n\nVoluntary Chinese immigrants and freed contract labourers in the\nSettlements differed considerably from their North American counterparts in\ntwo important aspects of occupational choice.\n\n\nFirst, except for the professional class of occupations which very\nfew of them were qualified to hold, the early Chinese immigrants were\nreported to be in the other four major occupational classes, namely,\ndomestic, commercial, industrial, and agricultural.\n\n\nThe type of vocations in these four classes spanned a wide spectrum,\nranging from hawking to financing.\n\n\nThe degree of internal constraint on the immigrants is the second\npoint of departure.\n\n\nFor the Chinese immigrants as a whole in the Settlements, external\nconstraints were manageable, but internally self-created constraints as a\nresult of rigid group boundary were relatively imposing.\n\n\nThe constraints created therefrom naturally reduced the immigrants\'\nchoice on a group basis.\n\n\nSuch internal constraints were not felt among the North American\nChinese immigrants, because of their relatively monolithic composition in\ndialect/locality origins: most of them were from siyi, or the four districts\nXinning/Taishan, Xinhui, Kaiping, and Enping) and sanyi, or the three\ndistricts Nanhai, Panyu, and Shunde.\n\n\nGiven the two conditions, namely externally imposed constraints and\ninternally created group constraints, four models of occupational choice are\npossible.\n\n\nThe two extreme models are each characterized by " externally\nfree-internally free" ( EF/IF) and " externally constrained-internally\nconstrained" ( EC/IC) conditions.\n\n\nThe other two may be seen as conditions that are " externally\nconstrained-internally free" ( EC/IF) and " externally free-internally\nconstrained" ( EF/IC).\n\n\nThe EC/IF model may be illustrated by the North American experience\nand the EF/IC model by the Chinese immigrants in the early Straits\nSettlements.\n\n\nThat Chinese immigrants in the early Straits Settlements were dialect\nbound is well documented.\n\n\nThe effects of this binding permeated not only into residential\nsettlements and social organization, but also occupational structure.\n\n\nA number of early observations associated some trades and occupations\nwith certain dialect groups.\n\n\nAn ecological perspective stressing the role of secret organizations\nhas been offered to account for such a relationship between contract\nlabourers and their types of job.\n\n\nBut, Yen suggests clan ties, or its extended territorial connections,\nas an explanatory factor.\n\n\nThis suggestion is plausible, insofar as the level of gener-\nalisation is confined to only voluntary/freed contract labourers.\n\n\nOne has yet to be convinced as to how hundreds of thousands of\nworkers could congregate to work in deserted areas like tin mining sites and\nplantations of various kinds if formal organization of labourers was\ninefficient.\n\n\nIt certainly makes sense to see these workers as bonded through their\ndialect origins, but clan network may be more readily employed in explaining\nthe occupation-dialect group affinity of the voluntary immigrants and the\nfreed contract labourers.\n\n\nAnd yet this occupational snowballing effect operated primarily on\nthe later immigrants, and the occupational choice of the first immigrants was\nbelieved to be a historical accident.\n\n\nShortly, we shall present some observations on such an occupational\npattern.\n\n\n Source of Data \n\n\nInformation on trades and occupations of the Chinese in the Straits\nSettlements is available from both direct and indirect sources.\n\n\nThe former includes Census of Population reports and, to some extent\nliterature on occupational guilds and news reports in the Chinese newspapers,\nwhile the latter consists of inscriptional data and documented observations\nmade by contemporary local residents.\n\n\nThe first-scientific census of population in the Straits Settlements\nwas conducted In 1871; thence there was one almost every decade.\n\n\nUnfortunately, occupational category for that issue was only\nsubclassified according to three ethnic types, namely, Europeans, Eurasians,\nand Natives.\n\n\nThe 1891 and 1901 censuses removed the occupation entry, because the\nreturn of occupation was said to be of little value owing to " the constant\nchanges of occupation that occur among the Native Population, especially\namong the Chinese".\n\n\nThe category on occupation was resumed in 1911, but was then\nsubclassified according to sex, and was geographically confined to Penang,\nMalacca, and Singapore.\n\n\nThe three censuses that contain some information about the Chinese\nand their occupations were those taken in 1881, 1921, and 1931.\n\n\nRemarks by the Superintendent of Census on the association between\nChinese dialect groups and their occupations are available in the latter two\nreports.\n\n\nThe formation of Chinese occupational guilds provides another direct\nsource useful in delineating the broader categories of trade among the\ndialect groups.\n\n\nThe information is contained mainly in Wu Hua\'s Handbook on Chinese\nOccupational Guilds.\n\n\nTwo Chinese newspapers, namely, Lat Pao and Thiam Nam Shian Pao,\nwhich were circulated in Singapore in the late 1890s, customarily reported\nthe occupational status of people in the news.\n\n\nContemporary residents living in the Settlements also made remarks on\nthe relationship between type of occupations and Chinese dialect groups.\n\n\nYet another important source for the topic can be found in\ninscriptional data which were released intermittently between 1972 and 1987.\n\n\nThe construction of occupationdialect group relationships from the\nepigraphic materials entailed a series of steps, beginning with a thorough\nscrutiny of the tens of thousands of inscribed names of donors that appeared\nin the temples, huiguans, burial grounds, and such like, founded between the\n1700s and 1941.\n\n\nNext, general names that are supposedly related to any trade/\noccupation with unambiguous nature were processed.\n\n\nThese names which indicate a definite kind of trade or occupation\ninclude the following: dang ( pawnbroking}, lou ( restaurant), tang ( Chinese\nherbal medical store), yao ( quarrying,lbrickworking), guan/xuan ( tea/coffee\nor beverage shop) chuang ( tailoring/clothing), banchang ( saw-mill), and\nchuan/zhou ( shipping).\n\n\nIn processing the occupational data, the dialect origins of the\nshops/shopowners had first to be established, prior to assigning a particular\noccupation to a dialect group.\n\n\nThis has been done elsewhere.\n\n\nWe then excluded shopnames that are associated with any businesses\nthat are considered to be of an integrative nature i.e., those that show no\ndialect distinctiveness for they do not fulfill our present purpose.\n\n\nBecause of the nature of the data given for the analysis, the concept\nof dialect groups is too embracing to be able to take care of internal\nsegmentations.\n\n\nWhat complicates the issue further are situations where some dialect\ngroups\' structural and organizational characteristics did not always match in\nthe early days.\n\n\nFor example, although structurally the peranakans or babas were\nassigned a specific category known as " Straits Born Chinese" in some issues\nof the Census of Population, they were treated as Minan people in the\nanalysis for two important reasons.\n\n\nTraditionally, most babas were of Minan origins.\n\n\nSocially, the babas in the early times were very much involved in the\naffairs of the Chinese, especially the Hokkien community.\n\n\nThey held offices in some of the more prominent subcommunal\norganisations; this is indicated in several minutes of the management\ncommittee meetings of the Malacca Cheng Hoon Teng, and also in inscriptional\ndata.\n\n\nThe range of coverage of the Census category for Hokkiens was not\nwell defined.\n\n\nlt is however rather clear that people from Xinghua, Fuqing and\nFuzhou were not included.\n\n\nThis exclusion suggests that Southern Hokkiens or Minan people may\nhave been composed primarily of people from Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and\nYongchun.\n\n\nDialect Group and Occupation Table 1 which is extracted from various\nsources shows the relationship between dialect group and trade/occupation for\nforty occupations and six dialect groups.\n\n\nThe list of occupations is by no means exhaustive.\n\n\nIt is unnecessary to be so, for as it is, it suffices to suggest the\nexistence of a relationship between dialect group and occupation among the\nearly Chinese immigrants in Singapore.\n\n\nAs can be seen from Table 1, businesses related to commerce,\ninternational trading, finance, and manufacturing were closely associated\nwith the Hokkiens ( mainly Southern Hokkiens), whereas the Hakkas and\nCantonese were mainly engaged in traditional occupations such as carpentry,\nsmiting, and herbal medicine.\n\n\nThe Hainanese were mostly attracted to service-oriented occupations.\n\n\nA very distinct cluster of transportation-related occupations were\ndominated by the Henghwa ( Xinghua) and Hokchia ( Fuqing) people.\n\n\nThe Teochius were more inclined towards primary production\noccupations such as planting, poultry rearing, and fishing.\n\n\nWhile there were Cantonese boat-builders, Hokchia seamen, Hokkien\nlongshoremen, and Teochiu fishermen, the Hakkas did not seem to like work in\nor near the sea.\n\n\nRemarks given by the Superintendent responsible for both the 1921 and\n1931 censuses, contained in Table 2, confirm the information given in Table\n1, except that the former\'s coverage extended beyond Singapore to the Malay\nPeninsula.\n\n\nTable 2 confirms that the Hokkiens were extensively engaged in\nfarming, trading, and common shopkeeping, while the other dialect groups were\nactive in occupations not featured in Table 1.\n\n\nAmongst the planters, the Hakkas specialized in cultivating cloves,\nnutmegs, and, later, rubber in confined areas such as Balik Pulau in Penang\nand Bukit Mertajam in Province Wellesley.\n\n\nOn the other hand, a large number of Hainanese had also worked in\nrubber plantations in some rural areas in Malacca, Negri Sembilan, and\nJohore.\n\n\nWorking in a rubber plantation was never a special occupational\nfeature of any particular dialect group, except for its ecological\nsignificance indicating the residential settlement of the group.\n\n\nThe Hainanese were noted for their occupational competence in\nhousekeeping, embracing services/skills in hotel keeping, Western cuisines,\nand beverage preparation.\n\n\nAs domestic servants, they serve mostly European households and\nestablishments.\n\n\nThe movement of these employers therefore determined the trend of\nthis Hainanese occupation.\n\n\nExodus of the Europeans and their families, foreshadowing the decline\nof the Hainanese role in domestic services, took place only when Malaya and\nSingapore became independent\n\n\nSince most European families lived in town areas instead of the then\nvastly uncultivated rural districts, most Hainanese were urban residents.\n\n\nRemarks made by the Superintendent of Census that most prostitutes\nwere of Cantonese origin are in effect only a re-confirmation of an earlier\nreport in newspapers of that period.\n\n\nIt was reported that in Singapore\'s Kreta Ayer area alone there were,\nin the late nineteenth century, already a few thousand prostitutes.\n\n\nPresumably they were Cantonese, because the residents there were\npredominantly of this dialect group.\n\n\nThis stereotyping was also echoed 1950s in Muar, Johore in a\ncross-dialect group reference. \n\n\nThe reference goes as follows: " The Teochius were reputed for their\nkuayteow, Hokkiens their mee; Hainanese for their coffee, and the Cantonese\nfor their pee".\n\n\nKuayteow is a special kind of rice noodle, and pee which is rhymed\nwith mee, is phonetical slang for a lady\'s private parts.\n\n\nThe Hokchia and Hokchiu ( Fuzhou) people were demographically\ninsignificant minorities, whose main occupations in the early days were in\ntransport-related works such as rickshaw pulling and bus driving.\n\n\nDoubtlessly, they were urbanites.\n\n\nDialect Group, Occupation and Location What has thus been revealed\nis that there is an occupational pattern formed along the lines of dialect\norigin, with reference to very specific locational distribution.\n\n\nData are available for such a relationship to be juxtaposed against\nthe following locations: Malacca, Penang, Singapore, Matang, Taiping, Teluk\nAnson, and Ipoh.\n\n\nThe occupations/businesses to be referred to are mostly traditional\nand include pawnbroking, restaurant, Chinese medicine, shipping, bookstore,\nquarrying/brickmaking, tea/coffee shop, tailoring, and sawmill.\n\n\nIt can be seen from Table 3 that the particular dialect groups\ntended to operate sawmills ( the Cantonese in Taiping), and bookshops ( the\nHakkas in Penang), and predominate in the shipping industry ( the Hokkiens in\nSingapore).\n\n\nWhile information on Cantonese/sawmill and Hakkas/bookshop is new,\nthat on Hokkien/shipping is a reconfirmation of the data in Table 1.\n\n\nSince the Hokkiens had been extensively engaged in the import and\nexport business in Singapore, which was an important port in the region\nduring the nineteenth century, it is therefore of no surprise to find that\nthey were also in the shipping venture.\n\n\nAs indicated in Table 3, certain dialect groups practised a\nparticular kind of trade in ( or not in) a particular location.\n\n\nBelow we shall go through some of those occupations.\n\n\nPawnbroking: The pawnbrokers during the period 1795 to 1910\nincluded Hakkas, Hokkiens, Cantonese, and the category of either Cantonese or\nHakkas at different locations.\n\n\nThe case of the Hokkiens being involved in pawnbroking requires\nsome explanation.\n\n\nThere were two temples which received donations from the five\npawnbroking shops in British Malaya.\n\n\nThe temples were in fact integrative by nature, and hence, the\ndialect origins of the donors were assigned on the basis of demographic\ndominance.\n\n\nDuring 1881 and 1911, the census indicated that the population of\nthe Hokkien and Straitsborn Chinese in Malacca were over 50 per cent of the\ntotal contemporary Chinese population.\'\n\n\nThe occupation-dialect group affinity may also be expressed in\nterms of location.\n\n\nThe Hakkas who operated a few pawnshops in Malacca were then only\nthe second largest minority goup there, making up 12 per cent of the town\'s\npopulation.\n\n\nDemographic dominance thus did not seem to have exerted much effect\non occupation-dialect group affinity for all types of occupation.\n\n\nRestaurant: The location effect also applied to the restaurant\nbusiness.\n\n\nWhile there were only six Hokkien-operated restaurants ( i.e.\n\n\nrestaurants whose operators had donated to Hokkien voluntary\nassociations) in Malacca in 1795, a total of 263 Cantonese and/or Hakka\nrestaurant proprietors had their businesses in Singapore rather than in\nMalacca.\n\n\nFrom the large number of restaurants owned by the Cantonese, it is\nalmost certain that the Cantonese had an edge in the business over other\ndialect groups.\n\n\nHerbal Medical Store: The Hainanese had only a few Chinese drug\nstores in Malacca, Penang, and Singapore.\n\n\nThe Hokkiens were comparatively keener than the Hainanese in the\ntrade which extended beyond the three Straits Settlements to Matang/Taiping\nand Teluk Anson.\n\n\nThe Cantonese in Malacca during 1880-1909 were not found to be\ninterested in the Chinese medicine business, but their counterparts in\nSingapore opened 117 such stores there.\n\n\nThe Hakkas appear to have been less interested in the trade,\njudging by the confirmed cases shown in Table 3.\n\n\nTheir interest would appear to be stronger, if half the cases\nincluded in the category " Cantonese and/or Hakkas" are assigned to them.\n\n\nTea/Coffee Shops: The Hainanese have usually been associated with\nthe coffee shop business.\n\n\nThe Hainanese in Penang in the 1870s contributed to such a\nstereotype, but this was not so in other locations.\n\n\nIn inscriptional data, there was no evidence that the Hainanese\noperated any restaurant which in some cases could have functioned as a coffee\nshop.\n\n\nTheir extensive involvement in domestic services in the early days\nhad perhaps kept them fully occupied.\n\n\nThe high proportion of European residents in both Singapore and\nMalacca created such a high demand for domestic servants that the Hainanese\nwere not inclined to enter the coffee shop business in the two locations\naround 1870.\n\n\nTailoring/Clothing: The Hainanese were more active in the tailoring\nbusiness in the 1870s in Penang.\n\n\nThe Cantonese and/or Hakkas were also involved in this type of work\naround the same time.\n\n\nNo shop belonging to any of these three dialect groups have been\nfound in either Singapore or Malacca Inscriptions.\n\n\nBrickmaking.\n\n\nThe Cantonese and Hakkas were found to have engaged in brickmaking\nin Singapore in 1855 ( Table 1).\n\n\nTwenty-five years later in 1880, the Cantonese were still in the\ntrade ( Table 3).\n\n\nThey had seven brick quarries in Singapore.\n\n\nThe Hokkiens in Singapore, however, showed no interest in the\nbusiness at all.\n\n\nBut their counterparts in Ipoh had set up one brick quarry there\naround 1898.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '8a25be51-7389-4655-88f0-0ed1d008ca02', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.705708+00:00',

{'text': '3 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY \n\n\nCaroline Yeoh\n\n\n Introduction \n\n\nThe idea that business has one and only one objective - to maximize\nprofits - has been the familiar position taken by business managers for a\nlong time.\n\n\nA contemporary proponent of this classical view is the widely\nrespected Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman.\n\n\nIn the words of Friedman: ...\n\n\nthere is one and only one social responsibility of business - to use\nits resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so\nlong as it stays within the rules of the game ...\n\n\nOver the years, however, there have been pronounced shifts in the\nviews of business managers about the " social responsibility of business".\n\n\nThere is no consensus on either a definition or the limits of socially\nresponsible actions, but clearly the concept of business\'s social\nresponsibility has been broadened beyond its traditional boundary of profit\nmaximization.\n\n\nDoes this mean, then, that business has social responsibilities?\n\n\nWhat are the arguments for and against the assumption of social\nresponsibilities by businesses?\n\n\nWhat are the actions that businesses can pursue to meet this broader\nsocial role?\n\n\nThese and other issues are examined in this chapter.\n\n\n Towards Broader Social Responsibilities \n\n\nThe social role of business is not a new concept.\n\n\nTheoreticians and practitioners have grappled with various aspects of\nthe " social responsibilities of business".\n\n\nA British management philosopher, Oliver Sheldon, was one of the\nearly advocates of this concept.\n\n\nSheldon observed changes in the business and social environment in\nthe 1920s and 1930s, which led him to question the prevailing management\nphilosophy of production and profit.\n\n\nHe noted the growth of mammoth organizations - corporations, labour\nunions, government agencies, etc.- and the attendant problems for management.\n\n\nSheldon also noticed another, more subtle change, namely, a public\nthat was increasingly cognizant of the need for more business involvement in\nsociety.\n\n\nA humanistic - production philosophy of management was put forward by\nSheldon; he tried to imbue in managers a concern for the human, and not just\nproduction, aspects of management.\n\n\nThe United States also had numerous social responsibility advocates.\n\n\nOne view, advanced in the 1920s and 1930s, was that the business\ncommunity must use its power and influence to deal with major social\nproblems.\n\n\nThis view asserts that business actions can and should be taken even\nthough there is no direct relationship with profit.\n\n\nThis charity principle underscored the appeal to business to extend\nvoluntary aid to the poor and needy in society.\n\n\nHenry Ford II was among the advocates of this concept of social\nresponsibility.\n\n\nThe stewardship principle, another viewpoint advanced in the 1930s,\nconsidered business managers as trustees not only of the interests of\nstockholders but also of society generally.\n\n\nThe decisions taken by business managers affect many people in\nsociety and they are thus expected to act in the interest of all those\naffected.\n\n\nAccordingly, business managers must maintain a balance between the\ninterests of stockholders, employees, customers, suppliers and the general\npublic.\n\n\nProponents of this view maintain that, if the various interests are\ncorrectly balanced, the company\'s overall profits in the long run would be\nmaximized.\n\n\nJohn D Rockefeller, Jr., Henry Ford and Frank W Abrams were among the\nbusiness leaders who echoed this philosophy.\n\n\nThese early ideas about the social responsibilities of business, as\nembodied in the charity principle and the stewardship principle, form the\nfoundation of the modern idea of corporate social responsibility.\n\n\nThe Social Responsibility Debate Not everyone, however, agrees with\nan enlarged role of business in the social arena.\n\n\nMilton Friedman is arguably the most prominent proponent of a\nlimited, strictly economic role for business.\n\n\nAs noted earlier, Friedman contends that the most socially\nresponsible role for business is to use resources efficiently, make a profit\nand obey the law.\n\n\nTo attempt to do more than this is irresponsible.\n\n\nFriedman argues that in a free-enterprise, private property system, a\nbusiness manager is an employee of the business and has direct responsibility\nto the owners of the business.\n\n\nStockholders generally want to make as much profit as possible, and\nthe manager\'s responsibility is to this.\n\n\nWhen a manager spends the stockholders\' money in the public\'s\ninterest and reduces the returns to the stockholders, he is spending their\nmoney without their tacit approval.\n\n\nSimilarly, when his social actions drive up business costs, which are\nthen passed on to consumers through higher prices, he is spending their money\nalso.\n\n\nIn effect then, the socially responsible manager is operating outside\nthe fiduciary relationship and is committing an illegal act.\n\n\nAnother offshoot of Friedman\'s argument is that when socially\nresponsible manager moves further away from the simple rule of profit\nmaximization into the social and political realm, he may not really know what\nsocial responsibilities he ought to take on in the public interest.\n\n\nClosely related to this argument is the view that the business\nmanager should not try to determine what is in the public interest because\nthey may actually be serving their own narrow interests and not those of the\nlarger group of stakeholders.\n\n\nTheodore Levitt has added another dimension to this argument when he\nexpressed his concern that the values of prominent business managers may come\nto dominate the values of society: ...\n\n\nthere is more than a contingent probability that, with all its\nresounding good intentions, business statemanship may create the corporate\nequivalent of the unitary state...The corporation would eventually invest\nitself with all-embracing duties, obligations, and finally powers -\nministering to the whole man and moulding him and society in the image of the\ncorporation\'s narrow ambitions and its essentially unsocial needs.\n\n\nOther arguments frequently advanced against business\'s social\ninvolvement include the following: One view is that business managers do not\nnecessarily possess the requisite skills to deal with social problems.\n\n\nThese managers may be competent in business - related areas such as\nproduction, marketing, finance, and so on, but special social skills are\nrequired to resolve problems such as crime and conflict in the community.\n\n\nOften, the point is also made that a business which adds to its cost\nby assuming social responsibilities, penalizes itself.\n\n\nTo illustrate, a business may be prepared to maintain higher\npollution standards, or install more safety equipment, or conduct more\nstringent pre-market testing of its products than is required by law.\n\n\nSuppose its competitors are not as socially responsible.\n\n\nIn situations like this, the socially responsible firm may actually\nplace its own competitive position in jeopardy.\n\n\nThere are also strong arguments on the other side of the debate.\n\n\nMany business leaders accept the argument that corporations operate\nunder franchise from public opinion and when society\'s expectation change, so\nshould the corporation\'s actions.\n\n\nBusiness operates within a set of norms and constraints which are not\nonly economic but also technological, political and social.\n\n\nThese are powerful influences, and business managers must,\ninstinctively, respond to these influences in their decisionmaking process in\norder to operate sucessfully.\n\n\nIn short, these managers realize that social responsibility and\nsuccess go hand in hand.\n\n\nBusiness managers also recognize that as a business expands, its\nimpact on the community increases and the public invariably takes more notice\nof its activities.\n\n\nLarge businesses have more public visibility.\n\n\nThese business managers recognize the value of positive images for\nthemselves and for business in the public mind.\n\n\nOften, this leads to corporate contributions to charitable,\neducational, cultural and other community programmes.\n\n\nMany business leaders, as concerned citizens, also participate in\ncommunity affairs.\n\n\nThese business people often have strong personal drives to serve\ntheir community and may welcome the opportunity to participate in social\naction programmes.\n\n\nThe argument that business has social responsibilities was given\nanother perspective in the 1971 policy statement of the Committee for\nEconomic Development, a group of influential businessmen:\n\n\nit is in the enlightened self-interest of corporation to promote the\npublic welfare in a positive way ...\n\n\nbecause people who have a good environment, education, and\nopportunity make better employees, customers, and neighbours for business\nthan those who are poor, ignorant, and oppressed.\n\n\nAs an added dimension to this argument, various commentators have\nargued that business managers cannot effectively discharge their long\nresponsibilities to their stockholders unless they behave responsibly towards\nthe employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholder groups The ability\nof these managers to protect and enhance the stockholders\' equity depends\ncrucially upon the prosperity, goodwill and confidence of the larger\ncommunity.\n\n\nAs such, it is clearly in the corporation\'s best interest to assume\ngreater social responsibility towards its larger community of stakeholders.\n\n\nBusiness managers also recognize that if they do not step up their\ninvolvement, the government will be pressurized to step in.\n\n\nThey correctly reason that the more businesses respond to societal\npressures, the less pressurized the government will feel to regulate their\nbusiness activities.\n\n\nRegulations often add more to business costs than the costs of\nprogrammes.\n\n\nRegulations also restrict the flexibility of business in responding\nto market competition.\n\n\nThus, if business by its own socially responsible actions can head\noff new government regulations, it is advancing its own interests.\n\n\nFurthermore, if business steps up its social responsibilities, it\nwill retain a needed credibility with the public and will be invited to, not\nrestrained from, participating in the public policy decision - making\nprocess.\n\n\nAs pointed out by Melvin Anshen:\n\n\nThere can be no greater danger than to permit the new rules to be\nformulated by either a small group of critics armed only with malevolence\ntoward the existing system or the much large group sincerely motivated by\nconcern for ameliorating social ills but grossly handicapped by their\nignorance of the technique and dynamics of private enterprise.\n\n\nThe corollary is that if business volunteers its services only after\nits resistance to change has been overcome by overwhelming public pressure,\nit may be denied participation when the rules of the game are being written\nfor business.\n\n\nThe above are some of the core ideas on why businesses should assume\nsocial responsibilities.\n\n\nIn addition, it is sometimes argued that businesses possess much\nsocial power which must be balanced by an equal amount of social\nresponsibility.\n\n\nThis is based on the so-called Iron Law of Responsibility which\nmaintains that those who do not use power in ways that society considers\nresponsible will lose it in the long run.\n\n\nAnother argument that is often put forward is that business is\ninnovative and creative so why not take advantage of this capability in the\nsocial and economic arena?\n\n\nAs Kenneth Andrews pointed out: .\n\n\ncorporate executives of the calibre, integrity, intelligence, and\nhumanity required to run substantial companies cannot be expected to confine\nthemselves to their narrow economic activity and to ignore its social\nconsequences.\n\n\nThere are many sound arguments from both sides of the social\nresponsibility debate.\n\n\nObviously, neither side has all the right answers.\n\n\nIt is important to be open-minded about the different viewpoints and\nto recognize that what works well in one situation might not work in another\nat all.\n\n\nSocial Responsibility: Strategies of Response Today\'s professional\nbusiness managers are undoubtedly more involved in social action programmes\nthan was the case a decade ago.\n\n\nThere is, however, no broad-based social pressure for every business\nto assume all the programmes that society " demands".\n\n\nBusinesses are not expected to do everything, although the pressure\nis mainly brought to bear on the larger business.\n\n\nBusinesses, large and small, can still pick and choose those socially\nresponsible actions they wish to take.\n\n\nSmall firms tend to wait until social responsibility issues arise\nbefore doing anything about them.\n\n\nTheir strategy is to wait and see what everyone else in the industry\nis doing, before action is taken.\n\n\nThey rely on a " follow-the-leader" strategy.\n\n\nMost small firms have few social responsibility problems.\n\n\nThey are normally not the target for anti-trust suits from government\nagencies or expensive lawsuits from consumer groups.\n\n\nSmall firms generally do not spend much time and money on social\nresponsibility planning by simply employing a reactive strategy.\n\n\nIntermediate-sized firms anticipate what is going to happen in the\nenvironment.\n\n\nThey recognize that they are too small to influence any major segment\nof the environment. \n\n\nHowever, they know that they are too large to avoid the impact of\nmajor changes in the environment.\n\n\nIntermediate sized firms typically draw up plans that are\ncontingency-based; that is, the competition adopts strategy A, then they will\ncounter with strategy B.\n\n\nThis is also a characteristic of their social responsibility\nplanning.\n\n\nIntermediate-sized firms will anticipate changes in public opinions\nand legislations, but their approach is very much of the " wait-and-see"\nvariety.\n\n\nThese firms will observe the responses of the large firms to social\nchange before implementing their own contingency plans.\n\n\nLarge firms generally pursue a proactive strategy.\n\n\nThese firms seek to influence their environment and plan\naccordingly.\n\n\nThey know that they are the most likely to be questioned about\ntheir social programmes, and they put in considerable effort to develop their\nsocial action programmes.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '72d95345-ca8d-431f-9056-8becae05c5c2', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.707318+00:00', 'english_score': 0.971213698387146, 'non_english_score': 0.028786301612854004}
{'text': 'Myths and the Malay Ruling \n\n\nClass by Sharifah Maznah Syed Omar\n\n\nChapter 1  Magic in Malay Myths \n\n\nMalinowski calls myths which endow the performance of magic with worth\nand validity as myths of magic.(l) Central to this type of myths is a\nconception of a world which makes no consistent demarcation between its\nseparate realms.\n\n\nFor example, Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa, a Kedah annals whose date of\nauthorship is unknown, opens with a magical world in which animals can speak\nand interfere in the affairs of man, where rain, thunder and lightning can be\nbrought down at will and where arrows can turn into flame.\n\n\n( 2)The well-known Malay chronicle, Sejarah Melayu, written most\nprobably in the latter half of the sixteenth century, relates the story of\nRaja Suran descending into the ocean.\n\n\nThere he discovers a kingdom, marries a princess, and has children.\n\n\nHe returns from the ocean on a flying horse.\n\n\nHis three sons return to the Malay world riding a white sacred cow.\n\n\nTheir arrival at Bukit Siguntang Mahameru turns padi grains into\ngold, leaves into silver and stems into gold alloy.\n\n\nAnd from the spew of the cow emerges a man called Bat.\n\n\n( 3) Free movement between heaven and earth is related in Hikayat\nHang Tuah, a court epic written in the early eighteenth century.\n\n\nThe text relates the story of a heavenly king who descends to earth\nand marries a mortal princess.\n\n\nThe king and his consort later return to the heavenly kingdom,\nleaving their son Sang Sapurba to rule the earth.\n\n\nSang Sapurba meets a princess whose origin is from the spew of a\nwhite cow.\n\n\nTo inform his parents of his proposed marriage to thc magical\nprincess, Sang Sapurba commands one of his ministers to ascend to the\nheavenly kingdom.\n\n\nHis parents frequently descend to earth to visit their grandchildren.\n\n\n( 4) In the tale, Bukit Siguntang functions as the center of the\nworld where heaven and earth converge.\n\n\n( 5) In the mythical world of the Malay historical narrative, the\nmanner of demarcating phenomena like heaven and earth, land and sea, man and\nanimal, animate and inanimate, the natural and the supernatural does not\nconform to empirical observation.\n\n\nThe mode of thinking giving rise to such classification is described\nby Ernst Cassirer as being governed by the " characteristic law of the\nconcrescence or coincidence of the members of a relation" ( 6) and is thus\nindifferent to the various levels of objectivization, which are distinguished\nby empirical thinking.\n\n\n( 7) The law of the concrescence or coincidence of the members of a\nrelation referred to by Cassirer, in explaining a mythical mode of thinking,\nis based or the law of sympathetic magic discussed by Edward Tylor and\ndeveloped by James Frazer.\n\n\nFrazer\' s theory of magic is relevant to our study of the Malay myths\nof magic.\n\n\nHe distinguished between magic and religion as well as between magic\nanc science.\n\n\nMagic seeks to compel the world of the supernatural to do its\nbidding.\n\n\nThe failure to get results is attributed to errors of procedure or to\na stronger counter - magic being brought to bear.(8) It involves the element\nof coercion or constraint as opposed to religion, which involves the element\nof propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man, believed to direct\nand control the course of nature and of human life.\n\n\n( 9) Frazer is not the only one to make such a distinction between\nmagic and religion.\n\n\nVan Baal notes that in all forms of magic, early investigators\nnoticed an element of compulsion or automatic effectiveness due to the\nskilful manipulation of esoteric knowledge which has so little to do with\nhumility or dependence on supernatural beings.(10) Van Baal himself defines\nmagic as " ritual acts, preferably of a simple character, executed to promote\nthe realization of a concrete end".\n\n\nll On the distinction between religion and magic, he says: " The\nactions of superhuman beings must be incalculable as such, and their power\nnecessarily invites an attitude of dependence among the believers, an\nattitude flatly contradicted by a magician\'s reliance on strict procedure."\n\n\n ( 12)The Compounding of Magic and Religion \n\n\nIn many Malay myths magic and religion are not distinguished.\n\n\nThe two elements seem to blend.\n\n\nA good example of this is the myth on the conversion of Pasai and\nMalacca to Islam.\n\n\nIn both cases both the rulers of Malacca and Pasai were converted to\nIslam through dreams in which they met the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n\nThe description of the dream in Hikayat RajaRaja Pasai ( Pasai\nChronicles) is as follows: " He ( Merah Silu) saw a person standing, his chin\ncupped in his hand; his eyes covered by his four fingers.\n\n\nThe person said, \'Merah Silu, recite the words of the profession of\nfaith.\' \'I do not know how to recite them,\' replied Merah Silu.\n\n\n\'Open your mouth,\' said the person.\n\n\nMerah Silu opened his mouth and the person spat into it.\n\n\nThe taste was rich and sweet.\n\n\nThen he said to Merah Silu, \'Your name shall be Sultan Maliku\'l\nSaleh.\n\n\nFrom now on your are a Muslim and will recite the words of the\nprofession of faith ....\n\n\nIn forty days\' time a ship will arrive from Mecca.\n\n\nThe words spoken by the people on board and all their observances\nwhich are in accordance with the institution of Islam, these you must follow\nwithout deviation.\n\n\nAnd you must obey all their instructions.\' On waking, Merah Silu\ndiscovered that he had been circumcized and was able to read the thirty\nsections of the Quran without a single fault.\n\n\nAnd the ship arrived to formalise the proselytization."\n\n\n( l3) A similar myth I related in Sejarah Melayu.\n\n\n( l4)These myths represent a fusion of magical and religious\nelements.\n\n\nAnother example of the lack of distinction between magic and religion\nis the myth concerning the origin of Malay rulers.\n\n\nIn Sejarah Melayu, the Malay rulers trace their lineage to two main\nancestors.\n\n\nOne is Raja Iskanda or Alexander the Great, a historical personality\nalleged to have been religiously appointed by God to rule the kingdom on\nearth,\'(15) and the other Sang Sapurba, a magical ancestor who ascended from\nthe ocean.\n\n\nThe magical and the religious ancestors are included in the same\ngenealogy without an awareness of the contradiction between the two.\n\n\nR.R.\n\n\nMarett argues that magic has anti-social possibilities, as opposed to\nreligion which is always approved by the group.\n\n\nHe states that it is possible to treat magic as a general name for\nall the bad kinds of trafficking with the occult and supra-sensible in vogue\nin a given society, while conversely, religion may be taken to comprehend all\nthe good kinds of such trafficking.(l6) He further states that it is religion\nthat has all the organization to itself, because public approval affords it\nevery chance of free expansion.\n\n\nMagic, on the other hand, as the enemy of organized cult and, indeed,\nof the social organization as a whole, must lurk in dark places.\n\n\n( l7)Garett\'s observation of magic, however, is true only for evil\nmagic\'(18 which is usually practised in private.\n\n\nThis is not the case for public magic.\n\n\nPublic magic is considered beneficent magic practised in order to\nsecure benefits for the community as a whole.\n\n\nIt is usually employed for healing purposes or to promote human\nactivities like hunting, fishing, gardening and determining the weather.\n\n\nIn the Malay feudal courts, magic was given state recognition.\n\n\nIt was sanctioned by rulers, performed and practised in the court.\n\n\nMagicians enjoyed high status in court life.\n\n\nThey were accepted as part and parcel of court life and encouraged to\nexhibit their magical prowess.\n\n\nFor example a certain Saiyid, a man of Arab descent, helped a ruler\nof Malacca defeat Siam by shooting an arrow from Malacca in the direction of\nSiam, which by thought and desire was believed to have killed the king of\nSiam.(l9) The act of sorcery in this instance was not practised in the dark\nbut in the open.\n\n\nA certain Yogi performed magical acrobatics before Sultan Ahmad of\nPasai with his approval.(20) Sometimes Malay rulers were themselves portrayed\nas magicians who demonstrated their magical abilities publicly to illustrate\ntheir superiority over others.\n\n\nExamples of this are seen in the story of Sultan Mansur, who dipped\nhis feet into the water which was then drunk by the ruler of China, which\ncured the latter\'s skin disease,(2l) and of the myth of Sang Sapurba, who was\nable to convert sea water into fresh water by dipping his feet in it.(22)\n\n\n The Law of Sympathy Underlying Magic \n\n\nIt is generally believed by scholars that magic works according to\ncertain laws or is based upon an association of ideas.\n\n\nln this respect, magic is considered to be akin to science.\n\n\nFrazer calls the law governing magic as the law of sympathy.\n\n\nTwo principles make up this law.\n\n\nOne is the law of similarity which gives rise to homeopathic or\nimitative magic and the other the law of contact which underlies contagious\nmagic.\n\n\nThe law of similarity assumes that like equals to like or that an\neffect resembles cause.\n\n\nThe law of contact assumes that a part is equal to its whole or that\nthings which have once been in physical contact with one another continue to\nact on one another, even after the contact has been severed.\n\n\nFrom the first principle, namely the law of similarity, the magician\ninfers that he can produce a effect he desires merely by imitating it.\n\n\nFrom the second, he infers that whatever he does to a material object\nwill similarly affect those that the object has been in contact with,\nregardless of whether it forms part of his body or not.\n\n\n( 23)Examples of imitative magic at work are the myths concerning the\nfoundation of cities.\n\n\nPasai, Samudera and Singapura were named after a dog, an ant and a\nlion respectively.\n\n\nIt is a mythical mode of reasoning which considers the display of\ncourage, strength and tenacity by these creatures not only propitious signs\nbut also as an argument that cities built on the very spots where the animals\nappear will actually draw qualities exhibited by these creatures.\n\n\nThe reasoning runs follows: As the animals display positive\nqualities, by principle of like producing like, so will the cities.\n\n\nLogically speaking, there is no causal connection between the sudden\nappearance of the animal, their display of positive qualities by the\ncreatures and the subsequent character of the cities.\n\n\nHowever, it is the illogicality of magico - mythical thinking that\nleads to such false association of ideas through the law of sympathy.\n\n\nA similar mode of thinking can be discerned in Maharaja Dewa Sura,\nthe ruler of Pahang captured and imprisoned by the king of Malacca, when he\nattributed the defeat of his country to the missing nail of his favourite\nelephant.\n\n\nSejarah Melayu relates the following: " It happened one day, after\nMaharaja Sura had been imprisoned for some while, that the elephant Ya\nKenyang was led past the prison-cage on his way down the river to be bathed.\n\n\nSri Maharaja Sura called him and when the elephant came to him, he\nexamined him and perceived that one of his nails was missing.\n\n\nAnd he said, \'To think that after all these years this is the first\ntime I have looked at my own elephant like this.\n\n\nNo wonder I lost my country.\'\n\n\n( 24) In contagious magic, on the other hand, the whole and the part\nshare a contiguity that is in no way disturbed by separation.\n\n\nA whole person can be reconstituted from one of his parts.\n\n\nIn a battle with a Malaccan warrior named Hang Tuah, Sang Winara, a\nMajapahit warrior was slain by the former.\n\n\nHis decapitated head, still alive, fled from the village and was\nrescued by four disciple warriors.\n\n\nIn a will he left his disciples, he ordered that his head be buried\nat the foot of a mountain and be dug out after seven years.\n\n\nHe would then return to life.\n\n\n( 25)The resurrection of the whole from the part also implies that\nlife force resides in different parts of the person. \n\n\nHikayat Raja-Raja Pasai relates how the soul or spirit of Princess\nBetung was locked in a single thread of her golden hair.\n\n\nWhen Merah Silu, the ruler of Pasai, plucked it out during her\nsleep, " blood poured out of the hole where the hair had been - white blood\nwhich went on pouring out continuously.\n\n\nAt last the flow of the blood stopped.\n\n\nBut by that time the princess was dead.(26) Here the personality of\na being is considered indivisible, residing as a whole in each of its\nparts.(27)', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3cf14375-46b4-4d24-9ed3-11f6d700cd96', 'added':

{'text': 'Stepping Out - The Making of Chinese Entrepreneurs \n\n\nBy Chan Kwok Bun\n\n\nClarie Chiang See Ngoh\n\n\nChapter 11\n\n\n Ways of Imaging and Arranging the World \n\n\nThe entrepreneur must continue to further himself and his resources in\norder to build up his empire.\n\n\nThere was always an image of growth, from " small trees to forests" (\n1) on which he envisaged his business would eventually become.\n\n\nDoing business has been compared by our interviewees with building a\nhouse, which must first begin with a solid foundation before the rest is\nconstructed.\n\n\nNg Teow Yhee the entrepreneur saw himself as the key personality in\nrealizing his vision, as the " driving force", the leader on the frontline,\nthe protector of his workers.(2) He had to exhibit leadership, courage and\nempathy with the workers.\n\n\nThese qualities allowed him to win the admiration of his workers and,\nmore importantly, to " control" their allegiance and employment.\n\n\nAs he evolved out of nascent entrepreneurship and into a more\nadvanced stage of business development, what seemed particularly important in\nintrapersonal competence was leadership; in interpersonal competence, a moral\ncode of " thinking" and " doing" good which formed the bonds between\nemployers and employees, and between business partners; in technical\ncompetence, an ability to organize and rationalize the firm towards a certain\ndegree of " modernism"; and in entrepreneurial competence, an aptitude to be\nin tune with evolving influences internationally as well as locally in order\nto seize opportunities.\n\n\nThis was the period of a " post-migrant" existence, when the sinkheh\nmetamorphosed from a common worker towards becoming a boss of his own, on\nthis pioneers\' land which he would henceforth call his " home" and his\ncountry.\n\n\nThis was the period where his business vision was being\nsystematically concretized.\n\n\nThe World Begins with Me What was most evident in most of the oral\nhistory interview transcripts was the significant role the interviewees gave\nto themselves, rather than the organization, in creating the best working\nconditions for the workers.\n\n\nThere was a strong belief in personal charisma and leadership, a\nbelief that, by and large, he alone had brought about his own success.\n\n\nThere was also an equally strong notion of worker allegiance and\ncommitment to him - and a belief that the social relations at the workplace\ncould be somewhat similar to those of a " family" situation whereby the\nfather / employer reigned, took care of, and guided the children / workers.\n\n\nThe impetus for articulating and erecting a familial form of\nmanagement style owed its origin to a fundamental world-view the entrepreneur\nhad about the social and cosmic world.\n\n\nFor many years, the individual saw himself as the driving force; he\nlearned that by reaching out, he could bring in more capital or human\nresources; by bringing in, he preserved; and by preserving, he could expand\nand reach out again.\n\n\nHe was continually perfecting himself through learning and the\nacquisition of worldly knowledge and experience which formed the\npreconditions for his exploitation and conquest of the world, much in the\nsame way they once went to the mountains and seas back in the villages in\nChina to exploit natural resources.\n\n\nQuek Xin\'s transcript was noted for the address he gave to his entire\nclan at a dinner in 1955, where he succinctly summarized his worldview.\n\n\nHis world vision began with self-betterment and self-cultivation -\nworking hard, and not being selfish and wayward, followed by social harmony\nin the family.\n\n\nAs said by his son: Before my father Quek Xin died, he left behind a\nfamily legacy which was on tape, a legacy to instruct the children in the\nclan to follow:\n\n\n1) Everyone in the family must remember his ancestors; when you drink\nwater, you must remember and be grateful to its source.\n\n\n2 All family members, old or young, must be loving, cooperative,\nunited and at peace with one another in order to enhance the prosperity and\nprogress of the family.\n\n\n3 The men in the family as well as in the clan must work hard and not\nbe lazy, self-seeking and wayward.\n\n\n4 Everyone in the family, old and young, must seek further education.\n\n\nEvery male or female family member must have at least secondary level\neducation.\n\n\n5 The Quek family will organize an Education Fund to assist poorer\nkinfolk to further their studies; any good youth can appeal to this Fund for\naid in furthering their education.\n\n\n6 Any male kin can borrow from this Fund but once he has completed\nhis education and started to work, he must try to pay back his loan in order\nto keep this Fund going.\n\n\n7 The mother of Kai Si was, from many years of my observation, a kind\nwife and a good mother because she was so uncomplaining.\n\n\nIn any case, women should not interfere in anything that concerns big\nbusiness.\n\n\n8 I have the intention of donating\n&dollar;10,000 to the Quek Clan Education Fund.\n\n\n9 1 am feeling old and weak.\n\n\nAfter I die, I hope Kai Teng and Kai Yuan will follow my wishes and\ncarry them out as well as cherish all that I said.\n\n\nl0 I wish everyone of you will continue to strive to be wealthy and\npowerful, in order to glorify the name and fortune of the Quek family.\n\n\n( 3) What was interesting in the Quek\'s family legacy was the\nimportance given to education as the vehicle toward self-perfection.\n\n\nQuek\'s own children were highly educated, some completing their\nstudies in Germany and America and the younger ones, in Singapore.\n\n\nQuek also encouraged clan members to strive and better themselves in\ndiverse professions so that the community could produce complementary talents\nfor building a stronger and united community vis-a-vis other dialect\ncommunities.\n\n\nHis ethnic chauvinism was not exclusive; the school he set up in\nMalacca openly admitted children from all dialect groups.\n\n\nHis national interests were both Malayan as well as Chinese; he was\nas involved in the clan activities in Malacca as he was in helping develop\nHainan Island.\n\n\nFor Quek Xin, the ultimate glory was to see Hainan Island develop\ninto a prosperous province; he would especially wish that the Quek clan in\nChina or overseas play a significant role in realizing that goal.\n\n\nQuek\'s world-view called for a hard-driving and achievement oriented\nindividual, functioning within a harmonious social order in the family, the\ncommunity and the state.\n\n\nIt was basically a Confucian social order.\n\n\nHe hoped that future generations will continue his tasks; what one\ngeneration could not achieve, the next generation must pick up, move on, and\ndo better.\n\n\n Extending Outwards \n\n\nWhen workers started their own businesses and became nascent\nentrepreneurs, they still relied heavily on the family as the earliest source\nof labour, exerting autocratic forms of paternalism on it and other close\nrelatives.\n\n\nWhen our entrepreneurs continued to expand and their businesses grew,\ntheir immediate family members still formed the inner core of management and\nownership, with cousins and relatives forming the outer rings of management\ncontrol.\n\n\nTheir pattern of social organization was aimed at transforming\nsecondary relationships into primary ones in order to establish a form of\npaternalistic control underlined by mutual reciprocity, commitment and\nloyalty.\n\n\nYet our entrepreneurs could not be contented with doing business with\nonly their family or lineage members, thus being necessarily handicapped by\nnumbers and their suitability.\n\n\nThey had to select and recruit, from wider networks, non-kin,\npreferably people from the same district or province, people who could be\ntrusted.\n\n\nOur entrepreneurs had to exercise a high degree of flexibility and\nwillingness to assimilate in order to establish these extra-parochial\nconnections, characteristics which a historian, Ng Chin Keong, argued as\nresponsible for the commercial success of the Hokkiens.(4) As a leader, the\nentrepreneur continually hunted for talent and human abilities by bringing\npeople in through marriages and the offering of position and status.\n\n\nHis business empire was basically an extension of self as well as an\nincorporation of talented " others" into family.\n\n\nThe " family phantom" effect, some twenty years after the teenagers\'\ndeparture from their villages, exerted itself again in our post-migrant\nentrepreneurs, who, by then, were busy creating their own families after\ntheir physical disengagement from their family homes.\n\n\nLike growing young trees, doing business had a compelling momentum of\nits own.\n\n\nThe entrepreneur had to use all his competences to stretch and reach\nout in all directions, seizing business opportunities which were " good and\nprofitable".\n\n\nAs one entrepreneur, Ang Keong Lan, said, " If one does not advance,\none has to retreat, and if one retreats, one has to close down."(5) But, in\norder to expand, one needs people, including those who are not family.\n\n\nOnce social relations fell out of the orbit of kinship affiliations,\nit became all the more difficult to manage and control them.\n\n\nOur pioneers solved this problem by personalizing or " family-izing"\nthese social relations: My thinking is not like the old ways.\n\n\nIt is wrong to treat workers only as productive digits to whom you\npay monthly salaries.\n\n\nEvery worker will have a day when he can make good for himself.\n\n\nWe have to treat workers like our own family members, like our own\nbrothers.(6) Tay Kia Hong treated his Malay factory manager " like a\nbrother", he said.\n\n\nTogether, they experimented to perfect the colour and texture of\nleather work but, despite hard work and suffering, there was no success.\n\n\nThose years, however, forged strong bonds between the two, and he\nrecalled his friendships with two other employees " to be like brothers".\n\n\nIn recollecting the past, he said: Mr Shih came from China.\n\n\nWhen I first met him some thirty years ago, I knew he was a good man\nso I enlisted his help.\n\n\nNow Mr Shih heads one of our food companies and he is sometimes sent\noverseas to look after my other interests.\n\n\nI am very fortunate to get someone like him.\n\n\nHe is smart but not proud.\n\n\nI treasure him more than jewels for I know how hard it is to get\ntalented staff.\n\n\nI am grateful to him for his loyalty, and he is grateful to me for\ntreating him like a brother.\n\n\nIndeed, in all these years, our relationship has grown to be more\nlike that of brothers, than that of employer and employee.\n\n\nThat\'s why I take great interest in his personal life and share in\nhis troubles.\n\n\nMy wife\'s brother has been with me since he was little.\n\n\nWe know each other so well and treat each other like brothers.\n\n\nWhen he makes mistakes, my wife and I would talk to him openly.\n\n\nSimilarly, I would listen to him with an open mind.\n\n\nSo three of us hold frequent discussions to determine the best\napproach.\n\n\nThese joint decisions bonded us and were really the secret of our\nsuccess.\n\n\nI do not believe in authoritarianism nor do I make my own decisions.\n\n\nI discuss with them and if we all think the decision is right, we\nwould go ahead with our plans.\n\n\nIf I am wrong, they will explain to me.\n\n\nThis explains why we have achieved something.\n\n\nFor all these years, we have not had any misunderstanding.\n\n\nI am so happy for that ( 7).\n\n\nForced by necessity, many entrepreneurs had to turn to other ethnic\nworkers as well.\n\n\nUnlike entrepreneurs in some specific trades who set up economic\nclosures by barring the entry of non-family members and " outsiders" into the\nsame industry based on discriminatory principles of kinship and\nparticularistic ties,(8) most Singaporean enterprises, for example, Yeo Hiap\nSeng\'s, had to rely on non-family as well as other ethnic members for their\nlabour.\n\n\nWhen Yeo Hiap Seng went into canning satay sauce, Malays were\nemployed.\n\n\nHowever, this need to expand the company by including non-family\nmembers did not necessarily mean that the entrepreneur would stop trying to "\nfamily-ize" work relations.\n\n\nOne entrepreneur, Ho Rih Hwa, spoke of his foreign employees in an\noverseas business venture in an intimate, familial manner, echoing a degree\nof familiarity built up from many years of business association and trust.\n\n\nHis basic dictum of interpersonal management was: " If you suspect a\nman, don\'t use him; if you use a man, don\'t suspect him." \n\n\nTrustworthiness was an important attribute he wanted to cultivate in\nan employee; equally important was the need for his own overarching "\npaternalistic" role in overseeing, if not directly supervising, his\nemployees\' business decisions and development.\n\n\nHe said: I spent about twenty years in Thailand.\n\n\nDuring this time, I got to know all my staff very well and vice\nversa-they knew me very well.\n\n\nWhen you operate for so long, you get to know your staff, not only\ntheir working capacity, you know their mind, their temperament as well.\n\n\nAnd you know who is trustworthy, who is not, what position you can\ntrust him in.\n\n\n( 1) Soon, Peng Yam, Oral

{'text': 'CHANGES IN THE FERTILITY POLICY OF SINGAPORE \n\n\nby Saw Swee-Hock\n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n\nThe term " population policies" is usually used to refer to those\npolicies adopted by a government to influence the course of population trends\nand patterns in the country.\n\n\n( l) Some examples of such explicit population policies are\nimmigration policy regulating the inflow of people into the country,\nmortality policy affecting the general health of the people, population\ndistribution or redistribution policy governing the movement of people within\nthe country, and fertility policy affecting the reproductive level of the\npopulation.\n\n\nThere are two types of fertility policy - those designed to encourage\nchildbearing and those designed to discourage childbearing.\n\n\nThose policies adopted by governments to persuade their people to\nproduce fewer children in order to lower the rate of population growth are\nknown as anti-natalist policies, while those meant to do the opposite are\nknown as pro-natalist policies.\n\n\nThe genesis of the national fertility policy of Singapore can be\ntraced to the election manifesto of the People\'s Action Party ( PAP) prepared\nfor the first general election held in May 1959.\n\n\nAccording to this manifesto, the family planning arrangements then in\nforce were totally inadequate for the task of spreading knowledge among the\nmasses.\n\n\nThe PAP intended to expand the family planning organization\nconsiderably so that it would effectively reach the people all over the\nisland.\n\n\n( 2) The Family Planning Association ( FPA), which had earlier urged\nthe colonial government to play a direct role in providing family planning\nservices, repeated its call to the newly elected PAP Government to take over\nits clinics.\n\n\nThe government, faced with problems of greater priority, refused to\ndo so, but played a more active part in the promotion of family planning.\n\n\nBesides continuing the previous practice of providing an annual grant\nto the FPA, the government permitted the Maternal and Child Health centres to\nbe used by the FPA to provide family planning services, participated actively\nwith the FPA in family planning campaigns, and in 1963 gave a valuable piece\nof land at nominal rent to the FPA to build its headquarters.\n\n\nThe final phase in the development of a national fertility policy\noccurred in March 1965 when the government appointed a three-man Review\nCommittee to look into the question of taking over the FPA\'s clinics.\n\n\n( 3) The Committee\'s Report, submitted in June 1965, recommended the\ngovernment takeover of all except three of the clinics.\n\n\nThis led to the tabling of a White Paper on Family Planning in\nParliament in September 1965, accepting not only the recommendation of the\nCommittee but also proposing the introduction of a national population\npolicy.\n\n\n( 4) In December 1965 the Singapore Family Planning and Population\nBoard Act, 1965 was enacted, according to which the Singapore Family Planning\nand Population Board ( SFPPB) was duly established in June 1966.\n\n\n( 5) The SFPPB was responsible for providing family planning services\nto the general public up to May 1986 when it was closed down; since then\nthese services have been provided by the Ministry of Health in its Maternal\nand Child Health centres.\n\n\nThe family planning programme under the management of the SFPPB and\nsubsequently the Health Ministry constitutes the principal component of the\npopulation control programme.\n\n\nThe second component of the national programme of Singapore is based\non legalized voluntary sterilization.\n\n\n( 6) The government was convinced that sterilization was a safe and\neffective method of birth control, and legalized voluntary sterilization with\nthe enactment of the Voluntary Sterilization Act in November 1969.\n\n\n( 7) Certain safeguards were, however, incorporated in the\nlegislation.\n\n\nWith the successful operation of the Act in the first few years, the\ngovernment further liberalized the performance of sterilization by removing\nsome of the more rigid conditions through the Voluntary Sterilization (\nAmendment) Act, 1972 in May 1972.\n\n\nThe final step was taken in December 1974 when the new Voluntary\nSterilization Act, 1974, which repealed the previous Act, came into\noperation.(8) Since then, voluntary sterilization has been made easily\navailable to women and men at their request.\n\n\nThe number of sterilizations performed in 1988 was 4,500, bringing\nthe total for the whole nineteen-year period to 112,568.\n\n\nThe third component of the population control programme is centred on\ninduced abortion which was legalized at the same time as voluntary\nsterilization.\n\n\n( 9) Induced abortion was first permitted under very strict\nconditions in accordance with the Abortion Act, 1969, which came into force\nin March 1970.\n\n\n( 10) As compared with voluntary sterilization, the legalization of\ninduced abortion attracted considerable debate and some opposition among the\ngeneral public.\n\n\nBy and large, the strict conditions and supervision imposed by the\nAct ensured the satisfactory provision of induced abortion to women without\nany major problems in the early 1970s.\n\n\nIn due course most of the restrictions were removed in December 1974\nwith the enactment of the new Abortion Act, 1974, repealing the previous Act.\n\n\n( l1) Thereafter, induced abortion has been widely provided in\ngovernment hospitals and private clinics to pregnant women on demand.\n\n\nIn 1988 the number of induced abortions amounted to 22,000, bringing\nthe total since 1970 to 288,666.\n\n\nThe fourth component of the national family planning programme\nmeasures has been introduced at various times since the late 1960s.\n\n\nThese measures are the restriction of maternity leave to the first\nthree children only from August 1968 and later for the first two only from\nAugust 1973; the change from a standard flat-rate accouchement fee to\nprogressively higher rates for higher birth orders in August 1969; the\nrestriction of normal child relief in income tax returns to the first three\nchildren born on or after 1 August 1973; the elimination of the point system\nfor Housing and Development Board apartments based on number of children in\nAugust 1973; and the according of priority in the annual Primary One\nregistration exercise up to the third child only in 1973 and the second child\nonly from 1976.\n\n\nVarious incentives aimed at promoting voluntary sterilization were\nalso introduced.\n\n\nThese are paid maternity leave for female civil servants who undergo\nsterilization after the birth of the third or higher order birth, seven days\nunrecorded full-pay leave for civil servants after sterilization, the\nreimbursement of accouchement fee after sterilization, and priority in the\nPrimary One registration for children with one sterilized parent.\n\n\nThe various components of the population control programme briefly\noutlined above have been modified and improved over the years.(12) The\ncomprehensive and strong fertility policy, coupled with rapid social and\neconomic development, has resulted in the spectacular decline in fertility\nfrom the high level in 1957 to the replacement level in 1975, and below this\nlevel until the present.\n\n\nThe city state of Singapore has indeed become quite well known for\nits effective fertility policy and its rapid transition from a high level to\na low level of fertility.\n\n\nIn 1984 Singapore attracted further attention when it introduced some\neugenic measures with the specific aim of improving the quality of the\npopulation.\n\n\nHowever, these measures did not prove to be popular among certain\nsections of the community and did not address the more urgent problem of\nbelow-replacement fertility.\n\n\nIt was not until 1987 that changes to the national fertility policy\nwere made, relaxing some of the old anti-natalist measures and introducing a\nfew pro-natalist measures.\n\n\nWhilst the development of the national fertility policy has been\nfully presented in earlier publications ( l3), this occasional paper will be\ndevoted to a detailed discussion of the major changes introduced in 1984 and\n1987.\n\n\n 1984 FERTILITY POLICY CHANGES \n\n\n Reasons for changes \n\n\nThe origin of the first major changes to the national fertility\npolicy of Singapore may be traced to the traditional National Day message\ndelivered by the Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, to a gathering of People\'s\nAction Party members and other specially - invited guests on 14 August 1983.\n\n\nA large part of his speech was devoted to the differences in\nfertility according to the educational background of mothers as indicated by\nthe 1980 Population Census data and to the findings of some researchers which\nappeared to show that the intelligence of a child is determined more by\nnature than by nurture.(l4) He expressed concern about the lop-sided\nprocreation pattern in which the lesser-educated women were producing too\nmany children while the better-educated were having too few since this would\nhave the adverse effect of lowering the quality of the population in the long\nrun.\n\n\nHe also said, " Therefore, we must further amend our policies, and\ntry to reshape our demographic configuration so that our better-educated\nwomen will have more children to be adequately represented in the next\ngeneration." The full text of his speech is reproduced in Appendix A.\n\n\nHis remarks in the National Day address, normally confined to matters\nof national importance, provoked a great debate in the mass media about the\nvalidity of the hypothesis that the intelligence of children is inherited,\nthat the mother\'s educational attainment is the principal determinant of a\nchild\'s intelligence, and that intelligence is dependent more on nature than\nnurture.\n\n\n( l5) As to be expected, there was no general consensus on these\nsomewhat controversial and emotional issues.\n\n\nAfter several months of public discussion on the lop-sided\nprocreational pattern of Singapore, the government made changes to the\nfertility policy in early 1984 with the aim of improving the quality of the\npopulation.\n\n\nThe year 1984 ushered in a new phase in the demographic history of\nSingapore when for the first time the qualitative aspect of the population\nwas taken into consideration in the modification of the national fertility\npolicy.\n\n\n Primary school registration \n\n\nThe first change aimed at encouraging more births from better\neducated women was announced on 24 January 1984 in relation to the primary\nschool registration exercise for children commencing school in January\n1985.(l6) The registration exercise was first introduced in 1972 to provide\nan orderly system of school admission in the face of excessive demand for\nPrimary One places, particularly in the more popular schools.\n\n\nIn an effort to strengthen the national fertility policy, the\ngovernment had taken the opportunity to incorporate anti-natalist measures\nrestricting priority to the first two children and to children with one\nparent who had since been sterilized.\n\n\nThe announcement of the pro-natalist eugenic policy in early 1984\nagain provoked considerable public discussion, mainly on the grounds that it\nwas unfair to give children of better-educated mothers an advantage over\nthose of lesser-educated mothers.\n\n\nThe amendments to the primary school registration to accord priority\nto children with better-educated mothers are outlined in Figure 1.\n\n\n FIGURE 1 \n\n\nPRIMARY SCHOOL REGISTRATION IN SINGAPORE: A COMPARISON OF THE OLD AND\nNEW SYSTEMS\n\n\nOld System New System\n\n\nCategory I: Category I: No change\n\n\nChildren who are citizens or permanent residents\n\n\nPhase 1 Phase 1\n\n\nFor a second child who has ( a) For a child whose mother has an elder\nbrother or sister at least 3 children and has an studying in the same school\nacceptable university degree or approved professional qualification\n\n\n( b) For a second child whose brother or sister is studying in the\nschool of his choice OR\n\n\nFor a child whose mother has only 2 children and has an acceptable\nuniversity degree or an approved professional qualification OR\n\n\nFor a child whose mother or father has been sterilized before 24\nJanuary 1984 after the birth of the first child and whose mother has an\nacceptable university degree or an approved professional qualification.\n\n\nOR\n\n\nFor a child whose mother has been medically certified to be unable to\nproduce any more children and has an acceptable university degree or an\napproved professional qualification.\n\n\nPhase 2 Phase 2\n\n\n( a) For a child one of whose\n\n\nFor a child one of whose parent has been sterilized parents has been\nsterilized after the birth of the after the birth of the first or second\nchild. or second child and neither parent has any " O" level passes OR OR\n\n\nFor a first or second child\n\n\nFor a child one of whose one of whose parents received parents has\nbeen sterilized his/her education in the before 24 January 1984 after same\nschool or is a the birth of the first or the member of the school second\nchild advisory or management committee or staff. \n\n\nOR OR For a second child whose For a child from a three-child elder\nbrother or sister family one of whose parents has received his/her education\nat least one " A" level pass or in the same school. the equivalent.\n\n\nFor a first or second child who has a parent or sibling directly\nconnected with the school.\n\n\n( b) For a first or second ( b) For a child from a two-child one of\nwhose child or three-child family parents is directly one of whose parents\nhas connected with the at least 3 O level passes school. or the equivalent.\n\n\n( c) For a child who is from ( c) No change one-child or two-child\nfamily.\n\n\nOR For a second child whose elder brother or sister is studying in\nan affiliated school.\n\n\n( d) For a child one of whose parents has been sterilized before the\nage of 40 and after the birth of the third or subsequent child.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a148e0a5-6c0a-4b2a-afb8-b1e2f8d324e0', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.711347+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9690576195716858, 'non_english_score': 0.03094238042831421}
{'text': 'CORAL REEF FISHES OF SINGAPORE \n\n\nby H W Khoo and S W Tay\n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n\nCoral reef fish communities are the most diverse and colourful of any\nfish communities with very complex inter-relationships between species (\nSmith and Tyler, 1972; Sale, 1974; Russell, Talbot and Domm, 1974).\n\n\nThis paper is based on studies made from the southern islands off the\nmain island of Singapore, particularly from Pulau Salu ( Fig 1).\n\n\nA few observations made from Pulau Tioman, off the east coast of\nPeninsular Malaysia, were also included.\n\n\nThe species composition and distribution in relation to the\nphysiographic characteristics of the littoral area, the effects of tides on\nthe distribution patterns, the trophic status of fishes from their food and\nfeeding habits, the behaviour of the fishes in terms of mobility, colouration\nand symbiosis with other organisms are discussed.\n\n\n PHYSIOGRAPHY 0F THE CORAL REEF AND ADJACENT AREAS \n\n\nBased on the nature of the substrata, most of the reefs around\nSingapore can be divided into five zones: the rock pool, the rocky reef flat,\nthe sandy reef flat, the reef edge and the reef slope ( Fig 2).\n\n\nDetails of each of these zones are given by Tay and Khoo ( 1985).\n\n\nHowever, a brief description of the various zones will be given here.\n\n\nThe rock pool zone is at the high water tide level.\n\n\nThey are totally submerged only during high spring tides.\n\n\nThis zone is characterised by algae such as Caulerpa sp, Chaetophora\nsp and Padina commersonni.\n\n\nThe main invertebrate animals are Ligia vitiensis ( sea slaters) and\nthe periwinkles such as Littoraria granularis, L undulata, L ventricosa and\nNodilittorina pyrimidalis.\n\n\nThe rocky reef flat zone lies at the upper inter-tidal region.\n\n\nIt is characterised by loose rocks and boulders, by barnacles such as\nBalanus amphitrite, Tetraclita porosa and Chthamalus stellatus and by\ngastropods such as Nerita undata, Monodonta labio and Planaxis sulcatus.\n\n\nThe sandy reef flat lies between the low water neap tide to the\nmargin of the reef edge.\n\n\nBetween August and January, Sargassum sp grows in this zone.\n\n\nMolluscs found in this zone are Thais echinulata ( dog whelk), Turbo\nbruneaus ( turban shell), Trochus gibberula ( top shell), Tridacna crocea (\ngiant clam), Malleus regulus ( T-shell) and Pyrene fulguran ( pyrenes).\n\n\nHard and soft corals are found in this zone.\n\n\nThe reef edge zone lies at the lower inter-tidal.\n\n\nThis zone is exposed only once in two weeks at the lowest low water\nspring tides; however, at other low tides it is covered by a shallow layer of\nwater.\n\n\nThere are many fungiid, brain and other kinds of corals in this zone.\n\n\nIt has a wide variety of living corals.\n\n\nBecause of the growth of these corals this zone is slightly more\nelevated than the previous sandy reef zone.\n\n\nWhen in season, Sargassum weeds extend down to this zone.\n\n\nThe reef slope zone is the subtidal portion of the reef.\n\n\nIt is never exposed at low tides and supports the greatest number of\nindividuals and species of invertebrates especially the scleractinian ( hald)\nand alcyonarian ( soft) corals.\n\n\nThe sea-fans ( gorgonids), the sea-urchins ( Diadema setosum) and the\nfire-ferns ( Aglaophenia cupressina) are characteristic of the reef slope.\n\n\n SPECIES COMPOSITION \n\n\nNinety-nine species of fishes from 28 families were recorded from\nPulau Salu ( Tay and Khoo, 1985).\n\n\nAbout 25% of these species ( Table I ) belonged to the family\nPomacentridae and 14% to the Lutjanidae ( including the Scolopsidae,\nPentapodidae and Caesiodidae) and another 11% to the Labridae.\n\n\nThese three families constituted 50% of the fish community from\nSingapore\'s fringing coral reefs.\n\n\n ZONATION AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF MOBILITY TYPES \n\n\nAll the fishes observed can be categorised into four mobility types\naccording to their home range or the size of the area which is required for\ntheir daily activities.\n\n\nThese four mobility types are.\n\n\n( a) Solitary and sedentary type.\n\n\nThese are fishes which are inactive in terms of swimming activity and\nusually live in holes and crevices.\n\n\n( b) Solitary and territorial type.\n\n\nFishes of this group are active species and do not confine themselves\nto their holes and crevices.\n\n\nThey defend territories which are relatively small areas from\nconspecies as well as others.\n\n\n( c) Solitary and vagrant type.\n\n\nThese fishes do not confine themselves to a small area or territory\nwithin the reef.\n\n\nThey are usually very active and wide ranging species.\n\n\n( d) Schooling and vagrant type.\n\n\nThis category consists of fishes which are active swimmers which swim\naround in schools and ranges widely in the reef.\n\n\nThe species composition of each of these " mobility types" and their\nspatial distribution according to the various physiographic zones are given\nin Table 2.\n\n\n SOLITARY AND SEDENTARY TYPE \n\n\nOut of all the coral reef fishes observed or captured, about\nthirty-two species are the solitary and sedentary type, with very limited\nhome range.\n\n\nThey are drab looking and not colourful, cryptic and secretive\nspecies hiding in nooks and corners, holes and crevices.\n\n\nThere are six species of apogonids ( caldinal fishes), four species\neaeh of gobiids ( gobies) and serranids ( groupers), three seolpaenids (\nscorpion fishes), two species each of blennids ( blennies), holocentrids (\nsoldierfishes), batraehoids ( frogfishes) and muraenids ( moray eels) and one\neach of brotulid ( brotulas), congrogadid ( eel-blennies), platycephalid (\nflatheads), plotosid ( catfish eel), centriscid ( shrimpfishes), centropomid\n( sea perch) and parapercid ( sand perches).\n\n\nIn the rock pool zone only five solitary and sedentary species were\ncaptured.\n\n\nThey are mainly benthic species.\n\n\nThree species of gobies, one blennid and a brotulid are present in\nthis zone.\n\n\nIn the rocky patch zone about fourteen species of these drab coloured\nand secretive fishes are the main inhabitants.\n\n\nAll the species living in the rock pools are also found in this area.\n\n\nIn addition to the five rock pool species, three species of\nscorpaenids, two species of batrachoid, and one species each of congrogadid,\nmuraenid, platycephalid and plotosid are found in this zone.\n\n\nThese eight species are not found in the rock pools.\n\n\nThey differ from those species which are the main inhabitants of the\nrock pools in that they are larger in size.\n\n\nThese same species except for the congrogadid are also present in the\nnext zone, the sandy patch zone.\n\n\nAbout thirteen species are observed in the sandy patch zone.\n\n\nNone of the rock pool species are found in this zone, thus showing\ndistinct zonation of the fishes.\n\n\nIn addition, four species of apogonids and one species of serranid\nare also found in this zone.\n\n\nThe apogonids are hovering species with less cryptic colouration than\nthe previous species.\n\n\nThey are often found hovering just off the bottom in front of\ncrevices into which they will seek shelter when confronted by larger\npredators, other intruders and during the fast moving currents of the rising\nand ebbing tides.\n\n\nThey have distinct horizontal stripes and spots on the body.\n\n\nExcept for the brown coral-cod ( Cephalopholis pachycentron) none of\nthe fish species which inhabit the higher zones such as the rock pools, the\nrocky patch and the sandy patch, are found in the lower and deeper reef edge\nand the reef slope areas.\n\n\nThis indicates definite preference of the habitats by the fishes\nresulting in their zonation along the shore.\n\n\nNine species of the solitary and sedentary types are present at the\nreef edge.\n\n\nThey consist of two species each of apogonids, serranids and\nholocentrids and one each of centriscid, blennid and muraenid.\n\n\nThe apogonids, centriscid and holocentrids are hovering species while\nthe serranids, blennid and muraenid are benthic bottom hugging species living\nin holes and crevices and rarely move far away from their homes.\n\n\nThe latter are also not easily seen because of their cryptic\ncolouration.\n\n\nAbout fourteen species can be observed at the reef slope zone.\n\n\nThe nine reef edge species are also found here.\n\n\nIn addition to them five new species are found at the reef slope and\nare not present anywhere else on the shore.\n\n\nThey consisted of two other species of serranids which can grow to a\nlarger adult size than the reef edge serranid ( Cephalopholis pachvcentron),\na species each of gobiid, centropomid and parapercid.\n\n\nAll these are solitary, cryptic and crevice dwellers.\n\n\n SOLITARY AND TERRITORIAL TYPE \n\n\nAll the twenty species of the solitary and territorial type present\nat the reef belong to only one family, the Pomacentridae ( damselfishes).\n\n\nThey are mainly hoverers with territories which they would defend.\n\n\nMost of them inhabit the reef edge and the reef slope.\n\n\nThree species are found in the rock pools and two of them ( Abudefduf\nbengalensis and Dischistodus chrysopoecilus) can inhabit all zones ranging\nfrom the rock pools to the reef slope.\n\n\nMost of the smaller individuals are found in the shallow rock pools.\n\n\nEight species are observed in the rock patch zone and three of them\nare similar to those in the rock pool.\n\n\nFive new additions are observed in the rock patch zone which are also\nfound in the sandy patch zone.\n\n\nMost of them belong to the genera Dischistodus and Pomacentrus.\n\n\nAbout seven species of these solitary territorial types are found in\nthe sandy patch and seventeen each in the reef edge and the reef slope.\n\n\nBesides the above three widely distributed species, four other\nspecies are also quite widely distributed.\n\n\nThese are found in the rock patch down to the reef slope zones.\n\n\nThese species are Dischistodus prosopotaenia, Pomacentrus\nalbimaculus, P littoralis and P rhodonotus.\n\n\nOnly two species are not common to both the reef edge and the reef\nslope zones.\n\n\nThey are Pomacentrus rhodonotus which is found commonly in the three\nother upper zones and Hemigliphidodon plagiometopon which is found only in\nthe deeper reef slope zone.\n\n\nNone of the eleven or twelve species belonging to the reef edge and\nthe reef slope zones, respectively, are observed in the rock pool, rock patch\nor the sandy patch zones.\n\n\nThese species are apparently restricted to the deeper waters.\n\n\nThe mechanism of their restriction may be physiological, ecological\nor behavioulal.\n\n\nNothing is known about the mechanism of zonation of these species.\n\n\nExcept for Amphiprion spp and Pomacentrus popei most of the species\nare dark coloured ranging from black to brown which is good cryptic\ncolouration against the brown and black background of the corals and\ncrevices.\n\n\n SOLITARY AND VAGRANT TYPE \n\n\nNone of these fishes are found in the rock pools.\n\n\nFifteen species each are present in the rock patch and the sandy\npatch zones.\n\n\nSeven species of labrids ( wrasses), two each of monacanthids (\nfilefishes) and pentapodids ( large-eye breams) and one each of blennid (\nblennies), chaetodontid ( butterflyfishes), lutjanid ( snappers) and\nscolopsid ( monocle breams).\n\n\nEight of them are present in both the reef edge and the reef slope\nzones.\n\n\nThey are Halichoeres hoeveni, H nigriscens, H chloropterus,\nChoerodon anchorago, Pentapus caninus, Scolopsis ciliatus, Chelmon rostratus\nand Lutjanus chrysotaenia.\n\n\nThese eight species are therefore widely distributed.\n\n\nTheir home and activity ranges are quite large.\n\n\nThey are found in all the four zones except the uppermost zone.\n\n\nAbout twenty-eight and twenty-nine species of these solitary and\nvagrant types inhabit the reef edge and the reef slope zones, respectively.\n\n\nTwenty-four species are common between the two zones.\n\n\nFive of the species are present only at the reef slope.\n\n\nThey are probably adapted to deeper waters.\n\n\nThey are Cheilinus fasciatus, Scolopsis phaeops, Lutjanus lutjanus,\nSiganus virgatus and Chromis cinerascens.\n\n\nFour of the species which are present in the reef edge zone are not\nfound in the reef slope but they are present in the two upper zones, in the\nrocky patch and the sandy patch zones.\n\n\nThese species are Halichoeres bicolor, Petroscirtes temmincki,\nMonacanthus tomentosus and M macrurus.\n\n\nThe ranges of these species apparently do not extend beyond the reef\nedge to the deeper parts of the reef.\n\n\nMost of the species in this mobility category are brightly coloured,\nfast swimming and can swim some distances away from the sea bottom when they\nare not feeding.\n\n\nOnly the Monacanthids are brown and not brightly coloured which\nallow them to camouflage among the brown sargassum and coral crevices.\n\n\nExcept for the chaetodontids, nearly all the species in this group\nare predators which probably accounts for their bright colouration since\nthere is no need to hide from predators.\n\n\n SCHOOLING AND VAGRANT TYPE  \n\n\nNone of the fishes belonging to this group are found in the\nuppermost littoral zones, that is, the rock pools, rock patch and the sandy\npatch except for the frys of the mullet ( Mugil sp) which are frequently\nobserved in the rock pools.\n\n\nThe main fishes belonging to this mobility type consist of four\nspecies of pomacentrids ( damselfishes), two caessiodids ( fusiliers), one\neach of mugilid ( mullets), atherinid ( silversides), hemirhamphid (\nhalf-beaks), carangid ( trevallies) and sphyraenid ( barracudas).\n\n\nOnly five of these species are present at the reef edge.\n\n\nThey Consist of one species each of mugilid, atherinid,\nhemirhamphid and two species of pomacentrids.\n\n\nThese fishes are usually found in schools swimming in mid-waters of\nthe sea bottom.\n\n\nMost of them have bright silvery bodies and are fast swimmers.\n\n\nThe reef slope is also the habitat of eleven of these schooling\nspecies which range around widely along this zone.\n\n\nThey include the above five reef edge species and six others.\n\n\nTherefore at the reef slope there are two more species of\npomacentrids, two caesiodids, one carangid and a sphyraenid.\n\n\nMost of them have dark dorsal and bright silvery ventral bodies,\nthe usual counter shading characteristics of mid-water pelagic dwellers.\n\n\n GENERAL OBSERVATIONS \n\n\nBased on the distribution of the reef fishes, the littoral region\nof the various islands in Singapore should be divided into three zones which\nare the composites of the physiographic zones used in this study.\n\n\nThey are the rock patch, the rocky-sandy patch and the reef\nedge-reef slope zones.\n\n\nIn terms of the total number of species there is an increase as one\nmoves down from the rock pool to the reef slope zone.\n\n\nThe reef slope contains the most fishes both in abundance per\nspecies and number of species.\n\n\nHarry ( 1953) in Tuamotu, Gosline ( 1965) in Hawaii, and Vivien (\n1977) in Madagascar reported also that most of the reef fishes are found at\nthe reef slope zone.\n\n\nIn terms of the physiographic zones, the rock pool zone is the\nhabitat of the solitary, sedentary, cryptic and secretive types of species.\n\n\nThe rocky patch and the sandy patch zones are the homes of the\nsolitary sedentary fishes as well as the solitary vagrant types.\n\n\nThe reef edge and the reef slope are, however, dominated by the\nsolitary territorial fishes and the schooling vagrant types.\n\n\n COVER AND TIDES \n\n\nThere are significantly more fish individuals in areas with more\ncover such as Sargassum and other sea-weeds than in open areas without cover\nor vegetation.\n\n\nTalbot ( 1965) in Tanganyika, found a clear relationship between\nquantity of fishes and percentage cover.\n\n\nAt high tides significantly more fish in terms of abundance are\nobserved than at low tides in the rocky and the sandy patches but no\nsignificant difference is observed between the reef edge and the reef slope.\n\n\nThis is obviously related to the relative degree of submersion of\nthe zones and availability of cover.\n\n\nThe lower two zones, reef edge and slope, are normally submerged at\nboth the high and the low tides, hence no temporal fluctuation in the fish\npopulation numbers due to tidal changes is expected.\n\n\nThe number of species for all mobility types increases\nprogressively from the rock pool to the reef slope.\n\n\nThis is related probably to the availability of hiding spots for\nthe solitary sedentary types; the increase in the bottom cover which provide\nprotective hiding areas to most of the solitary territorial fishes like the\npomacentrids, the most prominent being Pomacentrus littoralis and P\nalbimaculus; the increase in the water column ( Gosline, 1965; Chave and\nEckert, 1974) in providing space for manoeuvring for the actively swimming\nsolitary and the schooling vagrant fishes.\n\n\nRandall ( 1963) suggested that the more complex the structure and\ncomposition of the reef, the more hiding places and feeding areas it provides\nand therefore it will maintain and attract a greater number of fish species\nand individuals.\n\n\nThe reef edge and the reef slope zones are evidently more complex\nin terms of corals, plants and other invertebrates, hence providing more\nniches than the rock pool, rocky patch and the sandy patch zones.\n\n\n RESIDENTS AND TIDAL VISITORS \n\n\nAbout seventy-three species are residents while about twenty-six\nare tidal visitors ( Table 2).\n\n\nThe tidal visitors consist of five species of scolopsids, four of\nlutjanids, two each of pentapodids, caesiodids and pomacentrids and one each\nof lethrinid, atherinid, carangid, centropomid, hemirhamphid, labrid,\nmugilid, mullid, scarid, siganid and sphyraenid.\n\n\nAlmost all the solitary sedentary and territorial types are\nresidents of the coral reef.\n\n\nThe solitary vagrant types consisted of both tidal visitors and\nresidents but more of the latter.\n\n\nThe proportion of tidal visitors increase as one goes deeper\ntowards the reef slope.\n\n\nEight of the eleven species of the schooling vagrant type are tidal\nvisitors.\n\n\nThey visit the reef edge and the reef slope during the high tides.\n\n\nFour of these schooling vagrant fishes are pomacentrids, out of\nwhich three are residents ( Neopomacentrus filamentosus, N nemurus and N\ntaeniurus) and the other ( Chromis atripectoralis) is a tidal visitor.\n\n\nMost of the visitors are pelagic forms which pay short term visits\nto the reef edge and reef slope zones.\n\n\nThe schooling vagrant types seldom swim towards the shallower areas\nsuch as the rock pools and the rocky-sandy patch zones.\n\n\n FOOD AND FEEDING HABITS   Feeding Patterns \n\n\nMost of the fishes inhabiting coral reefs are the more recently\nevolved teleosts.\n\n\nThe diversity in coral reef fishes is an expression of their\nadaptations to the reef habitat.\n\n\nMost of their success and evolution is through adaptations that\nincrease their manoeuverability and their feeding efficiency.\n\n\nA diversity of feeding specialisations can be seen among these\nfishes from their mouth parts and feeding mechanisms and their food and\nfeeding habits.\n\n\nA detailed examination of the food of forty-six species of fishes\nshows that the coral fishes can be classified, according to the food\nconsumed, into four categories.\n\n\nThese are ( a) plankton feeders, ( b) algal feeders ( including\ndetritivores), ( c) benthic carnivores, ( d)cleaners and ( e) omnivores.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '2d63c326-48e5-4ae0-98fe-491f40e0b28f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.712489+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': 'FISH BIOLOGY: FROM GENES TO ORGANISM ANATOMY OF TNE DORSAL ROOT\nGANGLION IN SOME TELEOSTS \n\n\nLim, TM\n\n\nDepartment of Zooloqy, National University of Singapore,\n\n\nKent Ridge, Singapore 0511\n\n\nSensory neurones are nerve-cells whose fibres connect with receptors,\ntransmitting impulses started by receptors to central nervous system ( Hopper\nand Hart 1985).\n\n\nIn vertebrates, the cell body of such a neurone is attached to its\nnerve-fibres at a point along its course situated in the dorsal root ganglion\n( DRG).\n\n\nThe DRG is a collection of sensory neurones and glial cells.\n\n\nBoth cell types are derivatives of the neural crest cells ( Le Douarin\n1982).\n\n\nIn a typical vertebrate, each DRG is located opposite the dorsal horn\nof the spinal cord continuous with the dorsal root.\n\n\nTextbook illustrations usually show the DRG being anatomically\nseparated from the motor components of the peripheral nervous system.\n\n\nThis generalization may be true for most vertebrates, including\nmammals, avians, amphibians and elasmobranchs.\n\n\nHowever, the same may not be applicable to teleosts since there is\nhardly any systematic study on the anatomy of teleostean DRG.\n\n\nOur recent study in one bony fish, the tilapia ( Oreochromis\nmossambicus), revealed that its DRG is fused with the motor root, thus making\nit a mixed organ instead of a purely sensory one ( Laudel and Lim 1993).\n\n\nThis prompted us to look at more fishes and started our comparative\nstudy on the teleostean DRG.\n\n\nSome of the recent findings from several teleosts are described in\nthis paper.\n\n\n MATERIALS AND METHHODS \n\n\nThe fishes studied were tilapia ( Oreochromis mossambicus), guppy (\nPoecilia reticulata), zebrafish ( Brachydanio rerio), Japanese medaka (\nOryzias latipes), and swordtail ( Xiphomhorus helleri).\n\n\nThey were killed by chilling in ice and then fixed in 4%\nparaformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline ( pH 7.4) at 4C for at least 12\nhours.\n\n\nA lipophilic fluorescent dye with the formula:\n1,1\'dioctadecyl-3,3,3\',3\'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate ( DiI,\nMolecular Probes) was used to label the peripheral nerves and DRG in the\nspecimens.\n\n\nThe procedures have been described in Laudel and Lim ( 1993) and Lim\net al.\n\n\n( 1993).\n\n\nBriefly it involved removing the muscles flanking the vertebral\ncolumn and placing DiI crystals at where the peripheral nerves traversed.\n\n\nDue to the lipophilic property of the dye, it would spread along the\nnerves and thus staining the cells in the DRG.\n\n\nThe dye was allowed to spread over a few days when the specimens were\nleft in the fixative at 37@C.\n\n\nThe specimens were then scanned whole-mounted under the confocal\nlaser scanning microscope ( CLSM, BioRad MRC) using the 488nm ( blue) or 514\nnm ( green) excitation.\n\n\nThe confocal images were captured on film with the Polaroid\nfreeze-frame recorder.\n\n\n RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n\nThe branching pattern of the major spinal nerves in all the 5 fishes\nstudied follows a general layout.\n\n\nEach DRG gives rise to a dorsal, a medial, and a ventral sensory\nramus, respectively.\n\n\nThe ventral root, on the other hand, gives rise to a dorsal and a\nventral motor branch.\n\n\nThe ventral motor ramus usually fuses with the ventral sensory ramus,\nand together they course towards the ventral musculatures as a mixed nerve.\n\n\nThe dorsal motor ramus travels caudally and joins the dorsal sensory\nramus of the caudal segment.\n\n\nAlthough we did not study the minor branches of these peripheral\nnerves, an earlier study on the goldfish ( Fetcho 1986) suggests that the\ndetailed branching patterns could be species specific.\n\n\nThe motor nerves branching pattern has been described in the\nzebrafish by Westerfield et al.\n\n\n( 1986) and it differs in details compared to the goldfish\ndescriptions.\n\n\nThe DRG in these 2 species were, however, not documented.\n\n\nThe DRG in the 5 species described here show interesting variations\namong them ( Figs.l to 5).\n\n\nIn terms of shape, the DRG in tilapia, guppy, medaka and swordtail\nhave a roundish to a pear-shaped appearance when view laterally; whereas the\nzebrafish DRG tends to be elongated or sausage-shaped.\n\n\nIn terms of relative position to the spinal cord, the zebrafish again\ndiffers from the other 4.\n\n\nIt is lateral to the spinal cord while in the other 4 species, the\nDRG occupies a ventral position.\n\n\nVentral located DRG has also been recorded in the pike, Esox lucius (\nHarder 1975) and the striped bass ( Groman 1982 ) .\n\n\nHowever, Yokote ( 1982) found in the rainbow trout dorso-laterally\nsituated DRG.\n\n\nThe differences in shape and position of the fish DRG could be due to\nspecies differences in their neural crest cells migration and condensation\npattern during development.\n\n\nThe dorsal root leading from the DRG to the spinal cord also shows\nvariations among the 5 species studied here.\n\n\nThe dorsal root in the zebrafish is not very distinct when compared\nto the other 4.\n\n\nThe short and ill defined dorrsal root enters the spinal cord from\nthe elongated, laterally situated DRG at an angle almost perpendicular to\ndorso-ventral orientation of the DRG.\n\n\nContrary to this is the dorsal root seen in the medaka.\n\n\nIn this fish, dorsal root tends to flatten out and becomes broaden\nmorphology.\n\n\nIt leaves the ventrally situated DRG at oblique angle rostrally\ntowards the dorsal horn.\n\n\nThe dorsal roots in tilapia, guppy and swordtail are also distinct\nstructures.\n\n\nEach dorsal root appears as a tubelike connection between the DRG and\nthe dorsal horn.\n\n\nIn terms of seqmental origin, the dorsal and ventral roots in guppy,\nswordtail and zebrafish are found to connect the spinal cord at the same\nsegmental level as the vertebra that encases them.\n\n\nHowever, the dorsal root entrance to the spinal cord and the spinal\ncord exit of the motor root in tilapia and medaka are located one segment\nrostral to the vertebra that encases them.\n\n\nThis could be due to a pronounced relative shift of the muscle /\nskeletal segment to the spinal segment during growth ( cf relative shift of\nsomites to spinal cord seen in Xenopus laevis tadpole tail, Nordlander 1984).\n\n\nThe DRG in tilapia has been shown to contain both sensory neurones\nand motor fibres ( Laudel and Lim, in press).\n\n\nA similar picture is found in the DRG of the swordtail.\n\n\nA careful analysis of the DRG ontogeny in the tilapia revealed that\nthe mixed nature is due to the accumulation of DRG precursor cells ( i.e.,\nneural crest cells) around the ventral root during development.\n\n\nPrior to hatching, the DRG and the ventral root in the tilapia embryo\nare clearly separate entities ( Laudel and Lim, in press).\n\n\nThe development of DRG in the swordtail is probably similar to the\nprocess observed in tilapia.\n\n\nSadaghiani and Vielkind ( 1990) used HNK-1 antibody to trace the\nmigration of neural crest cells in swordtail embryos and noted that the HNK-1\nstained primodia of the DRG were also attached to the ventral part of the\nneural tube.\n\n\nAlthough these authors did not state whether the crest cells\naccumulate around the ventral motor root, our study suggests that they do.\n\n\nThe DRG in guppy, zebrafish and medaka are purely sensory in their\ncomposition.\n\n\nHowever, the DRG in guppy sometimes shows a tendency towards the\nsituation seen in tilapia and swordtail.\n\n\nUnder the CLSM the guppy DRG sometimes appears as spreading over the\ndorsal ramus of the motor root, thus giving the impression of the motor\nnerves growing through the DRG.\n\n\nThe differences in the DRG arrangement in relation to the motor root\ncould be due to subtle differences in the neural crest ontogeny among the\nvarious teleosts.\n\n\nIt can be concluded from this study that not all species of teleosts\nexhibit similar DRG structure.\n\n\nWithin the vast species diversity present in teleosts ( about 23,000\nspecies according to Northcutt and Davis 1983), this finding is not\nsurprising.\n\n\nHowever, in the course of reviewing literature, it was found that\nthere was a dearth in accurate descriptions of the gross anatomy of the\nteleostean spinal nerves, especially the DRG.\n\n\nMany textbooks tend to leave out the teleosts in their comparative\ndiscussions between classes of vertebrates ( eg see Vines and Rees 1972;\nHildebrand 1988).\n\n\nThis study helps to fill in the gap.\n\n\nThrough this study we also propose that the generalization of fish\nnervous structure presented in textbooks of comparative anatomy ( eg Kent\n1987), or even in atlases of fish histology ( eg Hibiya 1982) should not be\ntaken too seriously. \n\n\n\n\n HORMONES AND THE CONTROL OF GESTATION AND PARTUITION IN THE GUPPY\n( POECILIA RETICULATA) \n\n\nDepartment of Zoology, National University of Singapore,\n\n\nKent Ridge, Singapore 0511\n\n\nThe guppy is a life-bearer.\n\n\nThe male transfers sperms in bundles into the ovary of the female\nwhere they may be stored for up to 7 to 8 mon in a " seminal receptacle".\n\n\nUnlike the oviparous teleosts, the mature oocytes are fertilized\nintrafollicularly, ie while they are still within the follicles.\n\n\nFertilization occurs between 5 and 7 days postpartum.\n\n\nThis is followed by a prolonged intra-follicular gestation of about\n21 d, at the end of which the fully developed embryos are ovulated just prior\nto parturition.\n\n\nThe mean interbrood interval is 28 d.\n\n\nVery little is known about the hormonal control of gestation and\nparturition in teleosts.\n\n\nIn an attempt to unravel the role of steroid hormones in these\nprocesses, we have examined the serum profile of steroids at various stages\nof the reproductive cycle; the synthesis of steroid metabolites from\nradioactive precursors; and, the effects of specific steroids on ovulation\nand/or parturition in vivo.\n\n\nThe levels of estradiol-17g, testosterone, cortisol,17\nq-hydroxyproqesterone, 171-20-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one ( 17,20B-P) and\nprogesterone were measured simultaneously in microlitre-volumes of serum at\ndifferent stages of gestation.\n\n\nA highly specific, sensitive, precise, accurate procedure involving\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay was developed for\nthis purpose ( Venkatesh et al 1989).\n\n\nLevels of estradic and testosterone increased during vitellogenic\ngrowth of oocytes, and declined during late gestation to reach\nprefertilization levels at periparturition.\n\n\nCortisol levels decreased significantly during fertilization followed\nby an increase during gestation and a sharp decline again at periparturition.\n\n\nThe level of 17q hydroxyprogesterone was significantly lower at\nperiparturition than at other stages, while that of 20B-P was significantly\nhigher at periparturition than in late gestation.\n\n\nThere was no significant change in the levels of progesterone at all\nstages of gestation suggesting that, unlike mammals, progesterone may nobe\ninvolved in maintaining gestation in this fish.\n\n\nChanges in the levels of estradiol-17B and testosterone seem to be\nrelated to oocyte growth rather than gestation.\n\n\nThe elevated levels of estradiol-17B at term may also facilitate\nparturition, in addition to its stimulation of vitellogenesis during oocyte\ngrowth.\n\n\nOn the basis of the present results, none of the steroids measured\nare involved in maintaining gestation in the guppy ( Venkatesh et al - l990).\n\n\nIt is possible that such results reflect one major limitation of the\nprocedure - overlooking the role of a hiterto unknown steroid whose level was\nnot measured.\n\n\nWe therefore examined the metabolism of various radiolabelled\nprecursors such as pregnenolone, progesterone, 17q hydroxyprogesterone, and\ntestosterone, by isolated follicles ( oocytes and embryos enclosed within the\nfollicle layers) and extrafollicular tissue ( EF) of the guppy.\n\n\nFollicles and EF derived from ovaries at different stages of\ngestation were incubated in vitro with 1 Ci of radioactive precursors at 25C.\n\n\nThe radioactive metabolites were extracted and separated by 5\ndifferent high performance liquid chromatography systems, and detected with\nthe on-line radio-activity detector.\n\n\nThe metabolites were further characterized by thin-layer\nchromatography, microchemical reactions, and recrystallization to constant\nspecific activity; Venkatesh 1992a).\n\n\nWith 3H-pregnenolone as precursor, vitellogenic and post-\nvitellogenic follicles synthesized mainly androstenedione, 17q-\nhydroxyprogesterone, and the 5q reduced androgens ( 5q-androstane - 3,\n17-dione, 5q-DHT).\n\n\nThe synthesis of these " classical" steroids were, however, switched\noff during both early and late gestation.\n\n\nInstead, very polar steroids and their glucuronides were synthesized.\n\n\nAfter gestation, synthesis of the classic steroids resumed.\n\n\nMetabolism of 3H-progesterone showed a similar trend.\n\n\nVitellogenic and post-vitellogenic oocytes synthesized mainly the\nclassical steroids mentioned earlier.\n\n\nIn addition, 17a,20-P was produced by the post-vitellogenic oocytes,\nalbeit at a low level.\n\n\nStrikingly, increased synthesis of polar steroids and their\nglucuronides were seen during early and late gestation.\n\n\nAgain, there was no synthesis of classical steroids at these stages.\n\n\nSimilar trends in steroid biosthesis were evident with 3H-17a -\nhydroxyprogesterone.\n\n\nWith 3H-testosterone, vitellogenic follicles produced estradiol-17b\nand testosterone glucuronide. \n\n\nThe postvitelloge follicles produced the 5-reduced androgens and\ntheir respective glucuronides.\n\n\nClearly, gestation stage follicles rapidly converted the precursors\ninto 5-reduced and novel polar 7-hydroxylated steroids, and their\nglucuronides.\n\n\nPostpartum follicles showed very poor potential for steroid\nmetabolism.\n\n\nThese results demonstrate distinct changes in the steroidogenic\npotential of the follicles during the reproductive cycle.\n\n\nUnlike in other viviparous vertebrates, no particular steroid seems\nto be involved in maintaining gestation in the guppy - all the steroid\nprecursors are converted into highly polar metabolites and their conjugates\nduring gestation, thereby facilitating their excretion.\n\n\nThe EF ovarian tissue also synthesized 7-hydroxylated steroids and\ntheir glucuronides, providing evidence for the first time that the teleost\novarian EF is steroidoqenic.\n\n\nHaving identified some of the steroids whose levels in the the\nserum showed distinct changes during reproduction, the effects in vivo of\nprogesterone.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '23a33293-43d5-4731-82dc-d70404c2a926', 'added':

{'text': 'Ours To Protect \n\n\nby Chua Ee Khiam\n\n\n Preface \n\n\nA whole generation of Singaporeans is growing up with little idea of\nthe fecundity of the flora and fauna of their country.\n\n\nTheir familiarity is that of the concrete jungle.\n\n\nHence, the primary objective of this book is to increase the awareness\nof what is still available in our natural environment; for with awareness\nwill come appreciation and respect for nature.\n\n\nThis book will provide information for those who take an occasional\nnature hike or those who feel they must know more about the environment we\nlive in.\n\n\nFor those who have never ventured into the forests, let this book\nserve as an eye-opener to the natural habitat.\n\n\nThe second objective is to plead for conservation of our natural\nheritage, a pertinent issue in our land-scarce island and in a world fraught\nwith drought, floods, famine, pollution and other effects of environmental\nabuse and degradation.\n\n\nThe third objective is to give financial support to the Nature\nSociety ( Singapore) ( NSS).\n\n\nMuch of the work in this book was carried out on the various outings\norganised by the society with members who share a common dream - - that the\nnatural habitats and the rich wildlife be left undisturbed for future\ngenerations.\n\n\nThis book does not attempt to provide details or exhibit the full\nrange of the species available.\n\n\nThese are adequately covered in some of the references listed and,\nindeed, many species remain unidentified.\n\n\nAlthough attempts are made to place the flora and fauna in the\nhabitats where they are generally found, being dynamic organisms, they can\nalso be seen in many different parts of the island.\n\n\nThere is, however, no substitute for viewing all this in the natural\nstate as no photograph can adequately convey the fascination of the moment.\n\n\nPerhaps these pictures will help convey the complexity of the forms\nand colours in nature and stimulate readers to explore for themselves what\nSingapore has to offer.\n\n\nIntrigued by what we see, we are often tempted to touch or collect.\n\n\nIt is our fervent hope that as readers discover for themselves the\nflora and fauna here, they will learn to leave them in their natural state.\n\n\n Introduction \n\n\nBefore the landing of Stamford Raffles in 1819, Singapore was a\nlargely uninhabited island with lush tropical rainforests and coastal\nmangrove swamps.\n\n\nThe establishment of a trading post saw the introduction of\nplantation crops like gambier, pepper, cloves, nutmeg, sugar cane and\npineapple, with thousands of hectares of the forest being cleared to make way\nfor their cultivation.\n\n\nRubber was experimented with and when the demand for it soared, as\nmuch as 22,200 hectares were set aside for its cultivation.\n\n\nOther forested areas were cleared for housing and recreational needs.\n\n\nThe destruction of forests often rendered the land useless for\ncultivation.\n\n\nLeft unprotected, it bore the brunt of the erosive forces of rain\nwater, the nutrients were leached and the earth loosened and washed away.\n\n\nMany of these areas degenerated into grassland.\n\n\nMangrove forests were similarly obliterated for industrial use.\n\n\nIn 1884 there were about 5,000 ha of forests.\n\n\nFrom an island virtually covered with forest, today, only about 700\nha remain, 100 ha of primary forest and 600 ha mangrove forest.\n\n\nTogether with the secondary forest of the Central Catchment Area (\n1,600 ha) and pockets in other parts of Singapore, they make up only 4.5% of\nthe island\'s land area.\n\n\nIt was fortunate that the present Bukit Timah Nature Reserve was less\naccessible and spared from logging.\n\n\nThe forests of the Central Catchment Area were once heavily logged\nbut, with protection due to its importance as a water catchment area, much\nhas regenerated.\n\n\nCareful and maximal use of land can help balance what should be\ndeveloped and what should be retained.\n\n\nIt is heartening that within the limited forested areas left in\nSingapore, one can still marvel at the butterflies and birds in their\nsplendour of colours, still be awed by the myriad of insects and captivated\nby the intricate forms and beauty of the plants, their fruits and flowers.\n\n\nHowever, much has been irretrievably lost.\n\n\nDestruction and fragmentation of the forests spelled extinction for\nmany species of animals that lost their natural habitats.\n\n\nUnless we all try to protect and save what remains, there is no\nguarantee that the wildlife left in Singapore will not just vanish overnight\nas a result of callous thought and with the din of bulldozers.\n\n\nThe tropical rainforest is one of the richest natural environments in\nthe world.\n\n\nThe animal and plant life in the forests have taken hundreds of years\nto evolve and are irreplaceable.\n\n\nThe valuable natural habitat must be retained to support the\necosystem within which the wildlife strikes a complicated and symbiotic\nbalance.\n\n\nMany insects depend on plants for their survival.\n\n\nNectar of flowers is consumed by butterflies, bees and wasps; leaves\nare devoured by grasshoppers, while caterpillars, cicadas and bugs extract\nthe sap from branches and stems, and larva of beetles and scorpions live\naround tree trunks.\n\n\nIn the process, insects help to pollinate the flowers, thus\npropagating the plants.\n\n\nFruits are eaten by birds and mammals which disperse the seeds so\nthat future plant generations can be established in more distant areas.\n\n\nFauna and flora make complimentary demands on each other and this\ndelicate equilibrium is maintained by the endless cycle of nature.\n\n\nThe marine ecosystem is also in danger.\n\n\nThe reclamation that has reshaped Singapore\'s coastline has destroyed\nand seriously degraded marine life.\n\n\nThe high level of sedimentation as a result of land-filling is\nobvious to those who dive.\n\n\nThis reduces sunlight penetration, and sunlight is a prerequisite for\ncoral growth.\n\n\nAt 6 metres, the reef slopes still exhibit good growth but beyond\nthat, there is none.\n\n\nStudies in recent years reveal that there is a great diversity of\nmarine life that still thrive despite the odds, mostly around the southern\nislands like Pulau Hantu and Pulau Semakau.\n\n\nThe very processes of development that ensures progress and greater\nconvenience in our lives, ironically, also hastens our doom.\n\n\nThe deleterious effects that accompany modern technology cannot be\nignored: toxic discharge from factories, the fumes of cars and the tons of\nrefuse disposed daily.\n\n\nThese degrade the water and air quality which further disrupt the\ndelicate food chain.\n\n\nIt makes one wonder in the face of relentless assault on the\nenvironment, how long can human civilization survive?\n\n\nAlthough there is currently a growth of environmental consciousness\nthat is heightened by the increasing depletion of the ozone layer and the\nunrestrained destruction of the tropical rainforests, these crucial facts can\nbecome mere catch-phrases with an over-familiar ring.\n\n\nRecycling projects have not had the overwhelming support that they\nshould.\n\n\nWe sit back, waiting, either hoping for the ozone hole to heal or for\nthe ozone layer to be obliterated before we begin to act.\n\n\nWe watch forests being decimated and, until it is all gone, we will\nnever appreciate its importance.\n\n\nSingapore has a population of 3 million and this number is increasing\nto a target of 4 million.\n\n\nHousing, food and social demands will consume even more land, further\ndepleting the natural habitat.\n\n\nAlthough man-made gardens and parks help complement the green belt or\ncorridor, sustaining insects and some smaller species of wildlife, they\ncannot sustain the island\'s rich fauna, particularly the larger mammals that\nare threatened most with extinction.\n\n\nIt is important that we ensure the survival and continuance of the\necosystems of the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, the open grasslands, the\nforests of the water catchment areas, the mangrove and freshwater swamps and\nthe marine and coral communities.\n\n\nThis natural habitat is our heritage.\n\n\nIt is a delicate and precious habitat threatened by irresponsible\nactions.\n\n\nThe pictures in this book demonstrate the uniqueness of the life\naround us, helping us to reflect on the inhabitants of our natural habitat.\n\n\n Ours to Protect \n\n\nWith the world\'s population expected to double to 10 billion by 2050\n( ST 14/5/91), what then lies ahead for future generations?\n\n\nUncontrolled population growth is one of the principal causes of\nenvironmental degradation and habitat loss.\n\n\nDevelopment and environment imposes limits on each other.\n\n\nIn Singapore, it is no different.\n\n\nHaving achieved a standard of living near that of a developed nation,\nwe should now recognize the importance of conservation.\n\n\nAlthough our forests are but a minuscule part of all the forests in\nthe world, its loss would be more profound considering that it is all we have\nleft.\n\n\nMany new species of plants and animals are continually being\ndiscovered here and around the world, but with constant erosion of natural\nhabitats, these will be extinct before we can even record or study them.\n\n\nThe Periwinkle plant from Madagascar, used in drugs for the treatment\nof leukaemia and Hogkin\'s disease, is an example of the invaluable potential\nof the forest to medical science.\n\n\nThe White Costus ( wild ginger) contains ingredients used in\ncontraception.\n\n\nPain relief from many common ailments is in the form of a widely used\ndrug, Aspirin.\n\n\nThis was first discovered in the bark of the Willow tree.\n\n\nCyclosporin, a drug that revolutionized organ transplants is\nextracted from fungi.\n\n\nThe possibility of a forest tree ( Bintangor) being used to combat\nAids is still actively being studied.\n\n\nMany other forest plants have been used as herbal cures.\n\n\nThe vaccine to cure leprosy was only possible by incubating the\nbacilli in a mammal found in South America, the armadillo.\n\n\nOther mammals may offer solutions to many perplexing medical\nproblems.\n\n\nHowever, if their numbers are small, it will not avail them to\nmedical research, putting to rest any hope for finding a cure.\n\n\nTheir loss will be our loss.\n\n\nIt is heartening to note that the efforts of the Nature Society to\nsave natural habitats have not been in vain.\n\n\nThe acceptance by the Government of the Society\'s Master Plan, almost\nin its entirety, augurs well for wildlife in Singapore ( ST 1/6/91).\n\n\nThe diversion of the proposed Mass Rapid Transit line to preserve the\nrich bird haven at Senoko is a positive and committed move in nature\nconservation ( ST 20/6/91 ) .\n\n\nHowever, the proposal by the Public Utilities Board to develop golf\ncourses at the central catchment areas ( Sunday Times 28/4/91) is a\nregression.\n\n\nAnimal population levels must be of sufficient numbers to ensure\ntheir survival and permanence.\n\n\nAlready numbers have dwindled, and with further encroachment of\nforest reserves, the future looks bleak.\n\n\nWhen the natural habitat is destroyed, a whole ecosystem with its\nvast array of life-forms is forever extinguished.\n\n\nIt is a tragedy that parts of this supposedly " protected" forest,\nmuch revered through the years, may be bulldozed to meet the increasing\ndemands for golfing.\n\n\nIt would have made more sense to use less important, non-forested\nsites.\n\n\nTrees which took decades to grow and develop can be wantonly felled\nwithin minutes.\n\n\nThe removal of these trees will reduce the water-holding capacity of\nthe forest and the resulting rapid run-off of rainwater can cause serious\nerosion and flooding.\n\n\nWell-manicured golf links, although green and soothing, support\nlittle wildlife, and chemical fertilizers and insecticides that control pests\non the golf course may drain into and pollute the water catchment areas.\n\n\nAlready the access of small, ground-dwelling mammals from the BTNR to\nthe central water catchment forest areas and vice versa, have been severed by\nthe expressway which traverses them.\n\n\nEven aboreal creatures are being affected by this development.\n\n\nThe Flying Lemur does not actually fly but glides and, without the\nbenefit of tall intervening trees from which it takes flight off and lands\non, it risks being stranded at vulnerably low levels.\n\n\nPreserving some of the tall trees on either side of the expressway\nwould have benefited this endangered mammal.\n\n\nIn addition to this threat, the Flying Lemur is still being hunted\nby poachers for consumption in traditional medicine although its efficacy is\nunproven.\n\n\nIndeed, many people have never seen a Flying Lemur as it cannot\nsurvive in captivity.\n\n\nThe glimpse in this book may be the only one you will ever see. \n\n\nThe trapping of wildlife, especially mammals, to satisfy jaded but\ninsatiable appetites must not be condoned.\n\n\nSome of these mammals are kept as pets and it seems that the more\nendangered the species, the more appealing it is to own.\n\n\nOthers fall victim to poachers - - like the large numbers of flying\nfoxes which were trapped and brutally clubbed to death in the Central\nCatchment Area ( The New Paper 6/6/91).\n\n\nAlthough the National Parks Act affords protection to the flora and\nfauna in some sites, enforcement is difficult as there is insufficient\npolicing.\n\n\nPoachers have become bolder, openly defiant and fully aware that\nthere is little chance of being prosecuted.\n\n\nThis is particularly true of bird poachers.\n\n\nIronically, bird appreciation in this region, which takes the form\nof bird-singing contests, has encouraged poaching.\n\n\nMany songbirds are captured from the wild and it is a wonder that\nthey still sing mellifluously despite being caged.\n\n\nSome of the popular song birds are the Magpie Robin and the\nWhite-rumped Sharma.\n\n\nThe former was once reported to be the most common bird in\nSingapore but now only a few pairs exist in the wild.\n\n\nThe latter has been virtually trapped out of existence.\n\n\nAlthough already banned, the use of mist nets for trapping birds\nstill persists.\n\n\nIn 1991 alone, about 1.4 million birds were imported while 350,000\nwere exported ( ST 7/10/91).\n\n\nMoreover, there is an alarmingly high mortality rate within the\ntrade - a tragic waste.\n\n\nThe lack of suitable nesting sites is another problem faced by the\nbirdlife of Singapore.\n\n\nThe few existing sites are in relatively inaccessible and\nunfrequented areas, but the eggs and nestlings are still vulnerable to\npredators, including man.\n\n\nAlso, when more land is cleared for development, the natural\nfeeding and breeding grounds of the birds becomes increasingly scarce.\n\n\nThis displaces them to inhospitable areas which adversely affects\ntheir propagation, threatening their very existence.\n\n\nAn example is the very colourful Red Junglefowl which is threatened\nwith extinction by poaching and developments around Pulau Ubin.\n\n\nWorldwide, birds are squeezed out of areas where they rightfully\nbelong due to habitat loss - surely supremacy of the vast deserves more\nground support.\n\n\nMany migrant birds like egrets, bitterns, Common Kingfisher,\nJapanese Sparrowhawk, Barn Swallow, Blue-tailed Bee-eater will have less\nplaces to which to migrate.\n\n\nLast year, the Himalayan Griffon made a rare and brief visit here\nto escape the especially cold winter.\n\n\nThe few who saw it were held spellbound by its massive wing span\nand majestic flight.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '4dfc215e-d995-4d6f-be80-45b8e584f3df', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.715249+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9616470336914062,

{'text': "TROPICAL DEFORESTATION ( THE TYRANNY OF TIME) \n\n\nOoi Jin Bee\n\n\n Chapter 1 THE BIOLOGICAL SETTING \n\n\nThere is now a large and growing literature on the biological\ncharacteristics and features of tropical rain forests.\n\n\nIn this section only the salient aspects that have a bearing on the\nissues to be discussed later will be described.\n\n\nSchimper's ( 1903) description of tropical rain forest as a forest\nwhich is 'evergreen, hygrophilous in character, at least 30 metres high, rich\nin thick stemmed lianes, and in woody as well as herbaceous epiphytes'\nremains in general use today.\n\n\nIt describes the vegetation which covers the lowland areas of the\ntropics where temperatures are high and rainfall heavy, and where there is no\nmarked dry season.\n\n\nSuch lowland humid tropical areas make up less than one third of the\ntropical land surface ( Ewel, 1980).\n\n\nThe largest expanses of tropical rain forest are in the equatorial\nbelt but outliers occur northwards and southwards of the equator ( Whitmore,\n1984).\n\n\nThe main areas of tropical rain forest are: South and Central\nAmerica-The Amazon basin, with outliers north along the eastern side of\nCentral America, south to the Gran Chaco, east to the Guianas, and west to\nthe Andean foothills.\n\n\nAfrica - The Congo basin, largely Zaire and Congo, but including\nGabon and Cameroon.\n\n\nIt extends west to cover parts of Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast,\nLiberia and Guinea, and east to Uganda.\n\n\nAsia - The countries of insular Southeast Asia, with extensions east\nto Papua New Guinea, and north to parts of continental Southeast Asia, and\nnorthwest to parts of Myanmar, Sri Lanka and India.\n\n\nIn general, rainfall becomes more seasonal with distance from the\nequator, and in those parts of the tropics with a distinct dry season, the\ntropical rain forest gives way to tropical moist deciduous forest.\n\n\nDrier areas are covered by dry deciduous forest.\n\n\nFigure 1.1 shows the distribution of potential tropical rain forest\nand the countries with such forest.\n\n\nThis pattern of forest type distribution is governed by the pattern\nof macroclimates, which, in any one tropical region, is in turn determined by\nits position in relation to the continental land masses, air-streams and\nair-flow and the influence of sea and ocean currents.\n\n\nThere is no distinct boundary between the tropical rain forest and\nthe tropical moist deciduous forest.\n\n\nAt the edges of its distribution the rain forest merges into semi-\nevergreen rain forest and then into moist deciduous forest ( Mabberley,\n1983).\n\n\nSchimper ( 1903) describes the moist deciduous forest of Asia (\nmonsoon forest) as 'more or less leafless during the dry season, especially\ntowards its termination, tropophilous in character, rich in woody lianes,\nrich in herbaceous but poor in woody epiphytes'.\n\n\nThis vegetational seamlessness makes it very difficult to measure the\nareas under tropical rain forest, narrowly defined, and those under moist\ndeciduous forest.\n\n\nThe term 'tropical moist forest' ( TMF) is currently being used to\ncover both forest types.\n\n\nBased on remote sensing and other methods, the potential TMF land has\nbeen calculated to be about 16 million km ( Myers, 1979).\n\n\nAn earlier estimate has put the tropical rain forest component at 8.3\nmillion km - 4 million in tropical America, 2.5 million in Africa, and 1.8\nmillion in tropical Asia ( Pringle, 1969).\n\n\nIt is possible to reconstruct the ancient history of tropical rain\nforest from tossil evidence and the techniques of modern ecology.\n\n\nBroadly, the early tropical forests were the coal-swamp forests of\nthe Upper Cretaceous of Europe and North America, which then had an\nequatorial climate.\n\n\nDuring the Permian climatic conditions, specifically increasing\naridity, led to the disappearance of these forests and their replacement by\nthe next group of tropical forests - the conifers, the modern representatives\nof which are the giant Araucaria species of the western Pacific.\n\n\nThese in turn were eventually replaced during the Cretaceous by the\nproto-angiosperms and then the angiosperms.\n\n\nThe angiosperms, from which the modern flowering plant forest\nevolved, first appeared in substantial numbers in the fossil record in the\nCretaceous, which began about 135 million years ago and ended about 65\nmillion years ago.\n\n\nThey probably originated in a tropical setting in western\nGondwanaland ( a grouping of southern land masses) and then migrated to what\nare today South America, India and Australia ( Raven and Axelrod, 1974;\nAshton, 1977; Doyle, 1978; Flenley, 1979; Mabberley, 1983 ) .\n\n\nThe tropical rain forest has evolved from these beginnings, with\nangiosperms dominating almost all the equatorial regions of the world.\n\n\nAlthough the geographic distribution and extent of the forest would\nhave changed enormously as a result of continental drift, climatic and\nsea-level fluctuations, and the flora and fauna undergone evolutionary\nchanges, Richards ( 1973) considered it likely that its general appearance\nand characteristics today would not have been different from what they were\nin the remote past.\n\n\nThe tropical rain forest is the richest and most complex ecosystem in\nthe world.\n\n\nThis species richness is the most distinctive characteristic of the\ntropical rain forest, one which distinguishes it from the other ecological\ncommunities of the earth.\n\n\nThere are no accurate figures of the number of species, but rough\nestimates indicate that the tropics, covering only 6 per cent of the world's\nland surface, has about 40 per cent of its total stock of species (\nLowe-McConnell, 1969; et al., 1973; Raven, 1976; Myers, 1979).\n\n\nThis amounts to several million species of plants and animals -\naccording to Jacobs ( 1978) between 2 and 4 million, and to Sohmer ( 1978)\nabout 3 million.\n\n\nThe US National Academy of estimates that only about one-sixth of the\nprobable species of plants and animals in the tropics have been collected,\nidentified and named ( Nat.\n\n\nRes.\n\n\n1980).\n\n\nThere are roughly three times as many known species of anim plants,\nbut the great majority of these are insects ( Golley, 1983).\n\n\nLess than 1 cent of all the tropical rain forest species have been\nassessed for their potential value to man ( Caufield, 1982).\n\n\nThis species richness and species diversity is a function of the\nevolutionary history of the rain forest plants and animals.\n\n\nThe richest of the three major tropical regions of the world is\nSoutheast Asia which, according to Raven and Axelrod ( 1974) may be a\nreflection of the survival of taxa which migrated in geographically remote\ntimes to this relatively isolated, equable and diverse area.\n\n\nHere, as in the other parts of the tropics, life forms of the plants\nare dominated by trees, which, coupled with the abundance of lianes, herbs\nand epiphytes, result in a rich and diversified flora.\n\n\nThe floristic richness can be gauged from Table 1.\n\n\nAlthough the plant families in the tropical rain forest are numerous,\nthere are marked regional variations.\n\n\nFor example, the Dipterocarpaceae, which is the dominant family in\nSoutheast Asia, is not represented in the other major tropical regions.\n\n\nSpecies representation of the tropical rain forest biome vary not\nonly from continent to continent, but also within continents and even over\nsmall areas.\n\n\nWhile the tropical rain forest of the Old World and the New World\nshare a similar structure and appearance, few plant and almost no animal\nspecies are common to both.\n\n\nIn any equatorial area differences in topography, elevation and soils\nmay result in as many as 12 different types of rain forest ( Richards, 1952;\nWhitemore, 1984).\n\n\nAnother area of difference arises from the wide variations in the\nenvironmental combinations of soil and climate within the global range of\ntropical mixed forest which appear to make it more sensitive to disruption in\nthe African and American tropics than in Southeast Asia ( Leslie, 1989).\n\n\nIn the tropical rain forest ecosystem the major producers are woody\nplants, mainly trees.\n\n\nToday trees with wood of the desired qualities are the main products,\nalthough it was not so in the past ( see Dunn, 1975).\n\n\nTrees of a great diversity of sizes and structures are the most\nprominent members of the rain forest.\n\n\nOf the 3,000 species of trees in the Malay Peninsula, about 800 reach\none metre in girth, that is, are of commercial size.\n\n\nThe number of trees of 10 cm and above diameter at breast height (\nd.b.h.) in the lowland rain forest of the Peninsula has been enumerated at\n489 per hectare.\n\n\nThe numbers in the other main tropical regions are: Latin America (\nGuyana) 432; Africa ( Nigeria and Ivory Coast) \n\n\nTable 1.1 TAXA OF ALL HIGHER PLANTS IN TROPICAL FORESTS REGION\nFAMILIES GENERAL SPECIES Asia / Pacific Malesia 25,000 Borneo > 10,000 Malay\nPeninsula 7,500 ( 3,000

and 530 respectively. \n\n\nThe extremely rich floristic composition of the forests of the Malay\nPeninsula is seen in the fact that these 489 trees belong to 197 species, as\ncompared to 91 species for Guyana, 70 for Nigeria and 74 for the Ivory Coast\n( Loyett-Smith, 1949).\n\n\nAs the forest can support only a limited number of mature\nindividuals, the big trees that form the upper stratum of the rain forest are\nfar less in number than the smaller ones: a count in the Peninsula shows that\nthe number of trees with a girth of 4 feet ( 1.22 m) ranges from 55 to 95 (\nNg, 1983).\n\n\nIn Poore's ( 1968) study of a 23 ha piece of lowland rain forest in\nJengka, Peninsular Malaysia, of the 377 upper canopy species, 143 species (\n38%) were represented by a single mature individual, and 307 species ( 81%)\nby 1 to 10 mature individuals each.\n\n\nOne important consequence of species diversity and richness in the\nrain forest is that most species, including those trees that are commercially\nvaluable, are widely scattered and have a very low population density.\n\n\nAs Jacobs ( 1988) has graphically illustrated, in a rain forest where\nonly 4-10 per cent of all tree species are commercially valuable, the chance\nof a harvested tree being replaced by another is also about 4-10 per cent.\n\n\nThe removal of even a few members of a small population will have a\nlarge impact in percentage terms: thus in a 3-hectare area where there are\nonly 12 trees of Dyera costulata, logging two of these would reduce the per\nhectare population by 50 per cent.\n\n\nFurthermore, it takes a long period of time to rebuild viable\npopulations of individual species.\n\n\nAs Ng ( 1983) has put it 'In tropical rain forests far more species\nare uncommon than common hence the conservation of such forests is\ninseparable from the conservation of uncommon species'.\n\n\nIn the self-sustaining rain forest the ecosystem the main producers\nare and other woody plants, including thick-stemmed woody creepers, and\nlianes or vines.\n\n\nThese climbers grow to the canopy top and often have large crowns.\n\n\nOne hectare of the Malaysian mixed dipterocarp forest would have as\nmany as 376 climbers with stem diameters greater than 2 cm belonging to 25\nspecies ( Appanah and Putz, 1983).\n\n\nAmong the woody vines are those belonging to the sub-family\nLepidocaryoidaceae, the members of which are known in South-east Asia as\nrattans.\n\n\nSeveral hundred species of rattans have been identified, with\ndiameters ranging from less than one cm to over 20 cm ( Dransfield,1979).\n\n\nRattans have for long been an important product of the region's rain\nforest, to the extent that prompted Corner ( 1966) to describe the\ncivilisation of South East Asia as 'the rattan civilization'.\n\n\nApart from the smaller trees and climbers, the undergrowth of the\ntropical rain forest is made up of a wide assortment of herbaceous plants,\nincluding parasitic plants as well as the non-parasitic epiphytes ( plants\nthat attached themselves to the trunks and branches of trees).\n\n\nMosses, fungi, algae and lichens are also common.\n\n\nThese plants are a source of a wide range of products, including\ngums, resins, medicinal plants, and food and fibres.\n\n\nThe species richness of the plants of the tropical rain forest is\nrepeated in the fauna, and within the forest canopy is a wide range of\nanimals, some herbivorous, others carnivorous.\n\n\nThe plants and animals have complex inter-relationships exhibited,\nfor example, in flower pollination and fruit dispersal ( see Whitmore, 1984).\n\n\nStudies conducted of the animal groups in the tropical rain forest\nhave shown that the number of species is large compared with those of other\necosystems.\n\n\nThe Malay Peninsula, for example, has 199 known species of mammals\nbelonging to 32 families ( Medway, 1969).\n\n\nIn a 52 km area of lowland rain forest in Sarawak 135 species of\nreptiles and amphibia were identified in the course of one year, a number\nmore than three times that of a forest area in Mississippi ( Lloyd, et al,\n1968). \n\n\nThe avifauna is also extremely rich: a 777 km ( 300 sq ml) of rain\nforest in Costa Rica and Panama had 500 to 600 resident species of birds,\nmore than four times as many as are found in the broad-leaved forests of\neastern North America ( Richards, 1973).\n\n\nThe Malesian rain forest is just as rich, with some 70 per cent of\nthe 800 bird species known to occur in Sundaland being forest species (\nWhitmore, 1984).\n\n\nFive hundred species of insects have been captured in 2,000 sweeps\nof a net in a Central American forest ( Richards, 1973).", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "THE CONCISE FLORA OF SINGAPORE - GYMNOSPERMS AND DICOTYLEDONS \n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n\nSingapore consists of a transversely rhomboid main island of slightly\nover 570 sq km and more than 50 smaller adjacent islands and islets of\nvarious sizes.\n\n\nThree largest adjacent islands are: Pulau Tekong Besar ( 17.5 sq km),\nPulau Ubin ( 10.1 sq km) and Pulau Sentosa ( 3.5 sq km).\n\n\nSome of these islands and islets have been enlarged by reclamation in\nrecent years, as has the main island ( Tan 1987).\n\n\nSingapore is located between latitude 1&degree;09' N and 1&degree;29' N.\n\n\nThe climate, as expected, is equatorial and is characterized by high\ntemperatures, a large amount of rainfall and high humidity.\n\n\nThe average daily maximum temperature is 30.7&degree;C which occurs in the\nafternoon, and minimum of 23&degree;C shortly before dawn.\n\n\nThe average annual rainfall is 2,370 mm, distributed throughout the\nyear.\n\n\nRelative humidity often exceeds 90 per cent at night and in the early\nmorning, and is between 65-70 per cent in the dry afternoon.\n\n\nThe presence of the southeast Asian monsoon winds breaks the somewhat\nseasonal uniformity ( Nieuwolt 1973).\n\n\nNovember to January, during the northwest monsoon is slightly cooler\nand with higher rainfall.\n\n\nWhile May to August, during the southeast monsoon, on the other hand,\nusually is hotter and with lower rainfall.\n\n\nGeologically, the island of Singapore is composed of two basic types\nof rocks, namely sedimentary and igneous.\n\n\nThe ancient sedimentary rocks of the Triassic Jurassic period in the\nforms of shale, sandstone and conglomerate, occur in the western and southern\nparts of the island.\n\n\nGranite and associated igneous rocks of post-Jurassic period are\nfound in the central and northern, and also in the northeastern parts of the\nisland.\n\n\nSemi-hardened 'Old alluvium' of early Pleistocene age, which consists\nof coarse sands with clay and well-rounded pebbles and boulders, covers much\nof eastern Singapore.\n\n\nRecent sediments form a thin layer in isolated patches spreading over\nmuch of the coastal area and in river valleys and lowlands ( Hill 1973).\n\n\nThe highest point is at the peak of Bukit Timah ( 165 m) which is\nnear the centre of the main island, and like its surrounding hills, is formed\nby granite.\n\n\nIt is generally conceived that the island of Singapore was originally\ncovered with dense lowland rain forests except along its muddy estuaries and\nsandy stretches in the coastal areas ( Ridley 1900).\n\n\nShortly after the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, J\nCrawfurd, in 1829, witnessed that the island had the unvarying aspect of one\ncontinuous forest with no marked elevation from a distance ( Burkill 1959).\n\n\nBarely 70 years later, Ridley ( 1900) reported that a great deal of\nthe forest was felled, partly for the value of the timber and partly for\ncultivation of several introduced crops of economic importance.\n\n\nThese included nutmeg, cloves, cocoa, coffee, pepper, gambier (\nUncaria gambir), etc.\n\n\nOwing either to serious plant diseases ( eg nutmeg blight and coffee\nleaf rust), or to the exhaustion of soils ( eg the result of gambier\ncultivation) or other reasons, a large portion of this cleared ground was\nlater abandoned and became covered with lalang ( Imperata cvlindrica) and\nother grasses and sedges.\n\n\nEvery year some primary forests disappeared and more wastelands were\ncreated.\n\n\nThe indigenous flora was extensively and severely damaged during the\nsecond half of the nineteenth and the beginning of this century.\n\n\nWith the gradual process of improvement of the physical and chemical\nproperties of the depleted soil, a succession of plants - first herbs and\nshrubs and then trees - were slowly established.\n\n\nA common type of secondary forest, locally called Adinandra belukar (\nHolttum 1954), with Adinandra dumosa of the Theaceae as the dominant tree\nspecies, developed.\n\n\nAs populations keep expanding, land utilisation becomes more\nintensive.\n\n\nRapid progress has been made during the last two decades (\n1960s-80s), especially, in urbanisation and industrialisation.\n\n\nMany of the new towns and factories were built upon the land once\ncovered with lallang or by secondary forests.\n\n\nMangrove forests at Kranji and Ulu Pandan were partly or totally\ncleared respectively.\n\n\nOnly a few areas in Singapore have never been cleared for cultivation\nand thus more or less retain the original primary forest.\n\n\nThe most notable one is the Bukit Timah forest.\n\n\nIt was on the recommendation of NC Cantley in 1882, then\nSuperintendent of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, that several forest reserves\nwere demarcated on the island over the next few years.\n\n\nBukit Timah was the first forest reserve that was established as\nearly as 1883 ( Burkid, 1959).\n\n\nThe Nature Reserves Ordinance was passed in 1951, and in 1971, the\nNature Reserves Act came into being.\n\n\nThe Nature Reserves Board is charged with the responsibility of\npreserving the natural fauna and flora within the reserves.\n\n\nThe total area of the reserves at present according to the Annual\nReport, Ministry of National Development, 1984, is estimated at about 2000\nha.\n\n\nThe maintenance and upkeep of the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and\nLabrador Park comes under the administration of the Parks and Recreations\nDepartment.\n\n\nThe central Water Catchment Area, which is the largest nature\nreserve, is maintained by the Public Utilities Board.\n\n\nSince the island of Singapore is separated from the Malay Peninsula\nmerely by the narrow Straits of Johor, the flora of Singapore naturally is an\nextension of that of the southern part of the Peninsula.\n\n\nThe first list of the seed plants of Singapore and adjacent islands,\nentitled 'The Flora of Singapore', was compiled by Ridley ( 1900).\n\n\nSupplementary notes appeared one year later ( Ridley 1901).\n\n\nSubsequently, two separate lists entitled 'List of Dicotyledons in\nSyonan' and 'List of Monocotyledons in Syonan' were compiled by the staff of\nthe Botanical Gardens, Singapore, during the Japanese Occupation ( 1942-45).\n\n\nThese two latter lists were never published, but the typed\nmanuscripts were preserved in the Gardens.\n\n\n'An Annotated List of Seed Plants of Singapore' has been compiled by\nthe present author and published in instalments in the Gardens' Bulletin,\nSingapore.\n\n\nThe first ten parts ( Keng 1973-86) cover the Gymnosperms and\nDicotyledons native to and commonly found in Singapore.\n\n\nIt forms the nucleus of the present book, although numerous additions\nand corrections are incorporated, brief family descriptions are added, and\nseveral parts have been rewritten.\n\n\nManuscript for the companion volume on Monocotyledons is planned to\nbe ready in few years' time.\n\n\nA computation of the plants listed in this volume yields the\nfollowing preliminary results.\n\n\nApart from the commonly cultivated and naturalised plants, there are\n3 families, 3 genera and 8 species of Gymnosperms, and 125 families, 574\ngenera and 1,285 species of Dicotyledons native to Singapore.\n\n\nA fuller picture will emerge when the enumeration of Monocotyledons\nis completed.\n\n\nNevertheless, in view of the small size of the island, the flora must\nbe considered as among the richest in the world.\n\n\nThe 10 largest dicotyledonous families in Singapore in the order of\ntheir sizes ( that is, the number of species) are as follows. \n\n\nFamilies No.of Genera No.of Species Rubiaceae 41 125 Euphorbiaceae\n37 109 Leguminosae 30 66 Moraceae 5 59 Annonaceae 20 55 Lauraceae 12 42\nMyrtaceae 6 41 Melastomataceae 12 32 Apocynaceae 17 31 Verbenaceae 11 26 \n\n\nSome of the largest genera are: Ficus ( Moraceae), 43 species;\nEugenia ( Myrtaceae), 35 species; Calophyllum ( Guttiferae), 17 species;\nBaccaurea ( Euphorbiaceae), 14 species; Elaeocarpus ( Tiliaceae), 14 species;\nLasianthus ( Rubiaceae), 13 species; and Piper ( Piperaceae), 13 species.\n\n\nRidley ( 1900) in his enumeration Singapore plants marked 12 species\nof dicotyledons with asterisks as endemic to Singapore.\n\n\nHe, however, clearly pointed out that some of these species are\neither dubious ( eg Embelia lucida Wall., and Salacia lobbii Laws.) or\nprobably erroneously recorded in Singapore ( eg Uvaria subrependa wall).\n\n\nIn going through the recent literature, it becomes clear that some of\nthese 'endemic' species are synonyms of species of much wider distribution (\neg Lophopetalum fuscescens Kun = L javanicum Turcz), others are also found\nelsewhere ( eg Xylopia ridleyi King = Cyathocalyx ridleyi Sinclair).\n\n\nIn our present knowledge, only Polyosma kingiana Schltr.\n\n\n( Saxifragaceae), Sabia erratica PM vd Water ( Sabiaceae) and a few\nother species, are probably endemic.\n\n\nThere is no endemic genus.\n\n\nSeveral explanatory notes should be made here.\n\n\nFirstly, it is intended to bring the nomenclature of the plant names\ngiven in this volume up to date as far as possible.\n\n\nSeveral regional floras ( eg Backer and Bakhuizen f, 1963, 65 and 68;\nWhitmore 1972 and 73 and Ng 1978 and 89) and numerous monographs and\nrevisions were consulted.\n\n\nAdmittedly, a number of the new names may have been overlooked.\n\n\nSome of them, however, are cited as alternative names, others are not\naccepted.\n\n\nSecondly, native and introduced plants are differentiated in such a\nway that native ones are printed in bold face, and introduced one, in\nitalics.\n\n\nNative plants are those presumably indigenous to Singapore and they\nhave existed here since before the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles or much\nearlier.\n\n\nIntroduced ones were brought into the island by artificial means,\neither intentionally or unintentionally.\n\n\nHowever, their difference is not always clear, especially in case of\nsome weedy species.\n\n\nIn general, Ridley's discretion in his Floras of Singapore ( 1900)\nand of the Malay Peninsula ( 1922-25) is largely followed.\n\n\nNative species usually bear a collection number of the herbanum\nspecimen, which is in the collection of the Botanic Gardens, Singapore.\n\n\nMany of these specimens are of historical value.\n\n\nThirdly, it is not possible, nor necessary to record all cultivated\nplants.\n\n\nFor example, in the beginning of this century, a large number of\nGymnosperms were cultivated in Singapore ( Anderson 1912).\n\n\nSome of them survived to this day, others ( eg Bowenia, Ceratozamia,\nStangeria of Cycadales, and Cephalotaxus, Sciadopitys, Thujopsis of the\nConifer disappeared a long time ago.\n\n\nExotic plants, if they cannot reproduce vegetatively or by producing\nseeds, naturally will become extinct in a matter of

{'text': 'IS SEQUENTIAL ARGON-YAG LASER IDEAL FOR IRIDOTOMY IN DARK BROWN\nIRIDES? \n\n\nTony Ho\n\n\nRichard Fan\n\n\nLaser iridotomy in patients with brown irides is more difficult.\n\n\nTwo or more treatment sessions are often needed to create a patent\niridotomy.\n\n\nFailure and complication rates are higher.\n\n\nWe conducted a short term prospective clinical study to evaluate the\nuse of the argon and Nd:YAG laser in sequential combination at the same\nsitting to create iridotomies in 16 eyes from 10 patients.\n\n\nAll the eyes had dark brown irides.\n\n\nThese eyes had chronic angle closure glaucoma ( 7 eyes), acute angle\nclosure ( 3 eyes and 6 were fellow eyes.\n\n\nPatent iridotomies were achieved in single treatment sessions for all\nthe eyes.\n\n\nComplications were minor and included microhyphaema ( 1 eye), focal\nlens opacity ( 1 eye) and focal corneal opacity ( 2 eyes).\n\n\nNo iridotomy closure was noted to date.\n\n\nThe mean total energy delivered per eye by the argon and Nd:YAG\nlasers respectively was about a third of values reported by most studies on\npure argon or Nd:YAG iridotomy.\n\n\nSequential combination use of the argon and YAG lasers is a safe and\neffective iridotomy tool in dark brown irides and combines the advantages of\nboth laser procedures whilst avoiding most of their disadvantages.\n\n\n Introduction \n\n\nVarious types of lasers have been used to penetrate the iris.\n\n\nMany ophthalmologists consider the Nd:YAG laser the ideal iridotomy\ntool especially in the blue irides.\n\n\nHowever, in patients with brown irides, opinion is divided between\nthe argon and the Nd:YAG lasers.\n\n\nWhat about the patient with the dark brown iris?\n\n\nThese irides are thicker and have more pigment.\n\n\nThe higher complication and failure rates of laser iridotomy in such\npatients is well recognised.\n\n\nSchwartz ( 1) using a pulsed argon laser reports 20% failure to\npenetrate in brown eyes.\n\n\nQuigley ( 2) reports needing two or more sessions to achieve patent\nargon iridotomies in 58% of his patients with dark brown irides.\n\n\nTomey ( 3) states that the higher amount of YAG laser energy required\nby his patients was attributed to the high prevalence of thick, brown irides\namong his patient population.\n\n\nThe use of the Nd:YAG laser to successfully salvage an otherwise\nfailed argon iridotomy has been documented by certain authors ( 4, 5).\n\n\nHowever, to our knowledge no prospective clinical study has been\ncarried out to evaluate the sequential combined use of the argon and YAG\nlaser to penetrate the iris as a primary procedure at the same sitting.\n\n\n Materials and Methods \n\n\nWe conducted a short term prospective study to evaluate this\nprocedure in 16 eyes from 10 patients.\n\n\nAll the eyes had the dark brown iris type.\n\n\nWe use the Coherent Medical 920 Argon laser with a Zeiss slit-lamp\ndelivery system for the first stage and the Cooper Vision 2300 Q-Switched\nNeodymium YAG laser for the second stage.\n\n\nTopical pilocarpine 2% qid was instilled pre-operatively to\nconstrict the pupil where possible.\n\n\nAfter administration of topical anesthesia, an Abraham lens was\nplaced onto the eye.\n\n\nThe argon laser was used to make the initial bore.\n\n\nAn iris crypt was selected in the mid-periphery in either the\nsuperior nasal or temporal quadrant.\n\n\nA spot size of 50 microns was used in all the cases.\n\n\nPower and duration of shots were adjusted to achieve penetration with\nminimal iris charring ( Table 1).\n\n\nThe initial bore is made to an estimated depth of about two-thirds\niris thickness with an approximate diameter of 500 microns.\n\n\nThe Nd:YAG laser was used for the second perforation stage.\n\n\nEnergy levels were set between 2 to 5 mJ depending on the surgeon\'s\nestimate of the depth of penetration achieved at the end of the first stage.\n\n\nAll shots were delivered in single pulse mode.\n\n\nAll patients had their IOP measured at I hour post-op.\n\n\nIf not greater than 10 mm Hg above pre-op levels they are sent back\nwith prophylactic diamox 250 mg tid for the next two days.\n\n\nIf the IOP rise was greater than 10 mm HG at I hour post-op the\npatient was given a stat dose of 500 mg diamox and monitored for up to three\nhours, as it is well-documented that most IOP rises occur within the first\nthree hours post-op ( 7, 8).\n\n\nTopical steroids was given to all patients after the procedure.\n\n\n Results and Discussion \n\n\nTen patients ( 16 eyes) were treated between Jan 1989 and Nov 1989.\n\n\nThere were nine Chinese and one Indian patient.\n\n\nSix eyes had creeping angle closure glaucoma, three had acute angle\nclosure and seven were contralateral eyes.\n\n\nQuigley ( 2) reviewing 140 argon iridotomies reports that 58% of his\npatients with the dark brown iris tvpe needed two or more treatment sessions\nto achieve patency.\n\n\nTomey ( 3) reviewing 373 Nd:YAG iridotomies done in Saudi Arabia with\na " high prevalence of thick brown irides" reports 31 % of his patients\nneeding two or more treatment sessions.\n\n\nIn our study, patent iridotomies were achieved in all sixteen eyes in\nsingle treatment sessions.\n\n\nThe iridotomies created are typically large and round with fairly\nsharp edges.\n\n\nThis is in contrast with the slit opening of YAG iridotomy and the\nargon iridotomy where the hole is smaller with charred edges.\n\n\nCentral endothelial cell loss due to the indirect thermal effects of\nthe argon laser has been reported ( 6): In our study, the mean number of\nshots delivered in the first argon laser stage was 50 and in the second YAG\nlaser stage was 3.\n\n\nThe mean energy delivered per eye by the argon and YAG respectively\nis about a third of most studies on pure argon and YAG iridotomies ( Tables 1\nand 2).\n\n\nThis should have a significant bearing on complications resulting\nfrom either direct or indirect thermal damage to the eye.\n\n\nComplications seen were minor.\n\n\nMicrohyphaema was seen in 1 eye.\n\n\nThis is in contrast to pure YAG iridotomies where about 40% are\ncomplicated by bleeding.\n\n\nThis advantage is no doubt conferred by the use of the argon laser as\nthe first stage laser.\n\n\nOne of the major advantages of YAG iridotomy is that it is rarely\nassociated with focal lens opacification.\n\n\nThis is because the zone of optical breakdown and plasma formation\nfollowing YAG laser shots extends not distally but proximally towards the\nlaser source, a phenomenon termed the " plasma shield effect".\n\n\nOn the other hand, the incidence of focal lens damage in argon\niridotomy has been reported from 35 to 53% ( 6, 7, 8).\n\n\nThe low incidence of focal lens damage in our study is most likely\nconferred by the use of the YAG laser at the second stage.\n\n\nThe one eye which had this complication incurred it from an\ninadvertent argon shot.\n\n\nFocal corneal endothelial opacity was seen in 2 eyes ( 12%) and this\nrate is similar to that reported by most studies on pure argon and YAG\niridotomies.\n\n\nImmediately following the procedure, all the eyes had various degrees\nof pigment dispersion and free floating debris.\n\n\nHowever, no clinically significant inflammation was present by the\nend of the first week.\n\n\nPure argon laser iridotomy have reported closure rates of 21% to 30%,\nwhereas it is well established that YAG laser iridotomy appears to show no\ntendency to close in eyes uncomplicated by rubeosis or iritis although the\nexact mechanism behind this remains unclear ( 7, 8).\n\n\nIn our study, iridotomy closure was noted in only one eye to date.\n\n\nCould the use of the YAG as the second stage laser be the reason for\nthe low closure rates?\n\n\nFive of the eyes treated had intraocular pressure rise of over 10 mm\nHg within the first hour.\n\n\nAll these eyes responded well to diamox treatment.\n\n\nWe observed two further advantages from this procedure.\n\n\nFirst, there is no need to worry about inadvertent retinal damage and\none is therefore not restricted to using only the nasal side for the\niridotomy site.\n\n\nSecondly, the hazardous chipping and enlargement phase necessary in\nargon iridotomies is not necessary.\n\n\nOur study suggests that sequential Argon-YAG iridotomy is a safe and\neffective procedure and combines the advantages of both laser procedures\nwhilst avoiding most of their disadvantages.\n\n\nIt could well be the ideal iridotomy tool in the dark brown iris.

combined trabeculectomy with extracapsular cataract extraction and\nposterior chamber implantation or triple procedure was performed on 35\npatients.\n\n\nThe types of glaucoma include primary open

better\nvision and 94% had intraocular pressure control of 20 mmHg or less.\n\n\nOnly 5% needed adjuvant topical beta blocker therapy.\n\n\n Introduction \n\n\nThe presence of glaucoma, whether open angle or closed angle,\ncombined with cataract poses a problem in management.\n\n\nThere is controversy as to whether it would be better to combine\nsurgery in a one time procedure or to perform operations for the glaucoma and\ncataracts on separate occasions.\n\n\nRecently, the Triple procedure, or extracapsular cataract extraction\nand posterior chamber implant combined with trabeculectomy became the\nprocedure of choice for some surgeons.\n\n\nBecause of its good results this may be the ideal procedure for\nglaucoma patients who also have cataracts.\n\n\nPapers by Stark, Maumenee and others have shown the efficacy of\ntriples in open angle glaucoma.\n\n\nWe have found that triples are also effective in primary angle\nclosure glaucoma as well.\n\n\nThe patients were reviewed approximately 6 months post surgery.\n\n\nTechnique 1) A fornix based conjunctival flap was used.\n\n\n2) The superficial trabeculectomy scleral Qap was dissected and the\npartial thickness cataract incision was made.\n\n\n3) A disposable 25 gauge was used to make the anterior capsulotomy.\n\n\n4) The deep scleral tissue of the trabeculectomy was then dissected.\n\n\n5) The wound was extended with corneal scissors.\n\n\n6) The nucleus was then expressed.\n\n\n7) The wound was closed with 6 to 8 interrupted 8/O vicryl sutures\nand the cortex was aspirated.\n\n\n8) The implant was inserted in-the-bag with viscoelastic.\n\n\n9) The wound was closed with either interrupted or continuous 10/0.\n\n\n10) The conjunctival Qap was drawn inferiorly and sutured to cover\nthe trabeculectomy.\n\n\n Results and Discussion \n\n\nIn the majority of cases, ie 94%, there was cataract associated with\nuncontrolled glaucoma.\n\n\nIn 2 cases or 6%, the glaucoma was medically well-controlled but\nsurgery for cataracts causing poor vision was imminent and it was felt that a\ntrabeculectomy would benefit the patient.\n\n\nNineteen cases or 54% had pre-operative vision of 6/18 to 6/36 and\n14 cases or 40% had vision 6/60 or worse.\n\n\nPost-operatively 29 patients or 83% achieved 6/12 or better vision.\n\n\nSix patients or 17% did not achieve 6/12 or better vision.\n\n\nThese 6 cases were analysed.\n\n\nOf these 6 cases, one case had a retinal detachment 2 months after\nsurgery, I had pre-existing retinal branch vein occlusion with maculopathy\nand 3 had severe glaucomatous field defect affecting fixation.\n\n\nOne case with poor vision was lost to follow-up and we are uncertain\nwhether the poor vision was due to pre-existing macular pathology was\nexcluded.\n\n\n29 cases or 83% obtained 6/12 or better vision after surgery.\n\n\nRegarding the types of glaucoma undergoing triple procedure, 57% of\ncases had primary open angle glaucoma and 23Co had chronic primary angle\nclosure glaucoma.\n\n\nFourteen percent had acute angle closure glaucoma and 6% had\nsecondary glaucoma.\n\n\nOn comparing pre and post-operative intraocular pressure control, we\nfind pre-operatively 2 cases or 20% had good control with IOP lower than 20\nmm Hg with medication.\n\n\nOf those with poor control despite medication, 27 cases or 77% had\nIOP between 21 to 39 mm Hg.\n\n\nSix cases or 18% had IOP higher than 40 mm Hg.\n\n\nPostoperatively 33 cases or 94% had IOP lower than 20 mm Hg.\n\n\nOf this group, 5 cases or 14% were on adjuvant topical beta blocker\ntherapy.\n\n\nOnly 2 cases had IOP in the mid-twenties post-operatively and may\nrequire further surgery. \n\n\nThe open angle glaucoma cases had an average pre-operative IOP of\n30 mm Hg and an average post-operative pressure of 15 mm Hg.\n\n\nThis is an average pressure decrease of 15 mm Hg after operation.\n\n\nThe Primary Chronic angle closure group had an average pre\noperative IOP of 38 mm Hg and an average post-operative IOP of 13 mm Hg.\n\n\nThis is an average IOP decrease of about 25 mm Hg.\n\n\nThe acute angle closure group had an average IOP pre op of 32 mm Hg\nand a post op average of 11 mm Hg which is a 21 mm Hg average decrease.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a36b85b2-6888-4749-8830-59c7dd8ba3fe', 'added':

{'text': 'DEFECT-INDUCED DESORPTION PHENOMENA IN NON-METALLIC SOLIDS \n\n\nC K Ong\n\n\nDepartment of Physics\n\n\nNational University of Singapore\n\n\nKent Ridge\n\n\nSingapore 0511\n\n\nThe mechanisms of desorption phenomena of solids under laser\nirradiation exploit defects and defect processes.\n\n\nThis paper surveys the optical damages of ionic crystals and\nelectronically - stimulated desorption both in ionic crystals and GaP.\n\n\nTheir properties in relation to such mechanisms are summarized.\n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n\nIn the study of desorption phenomena of solids under optical or\nparticle irradiation, defects and defect processes are important components.\n\n\nFirstly, there may be intrinsic defects already present before the\nirradiation or some transient defects created by the incident beam.\n\n\nOnce the particle energies have been converted to thermal or\nelectronic energy, there are several defect processes which may lead to\ndefect annihilation or aggregation, or to processes like two-hole\nlocalization.\n\n\nIn the present paper, we discuss some of the main defects and defect\nprocesses in the context of the optical damages of alkali halides and GaP.\n\n\nIn this case, experimental work alone is not sufficient for a full\nunderstanding of the processes involved.\n\n\nIt is because the actual situation may be very complex and non-ideal\nthat experiment cannot separate the many components involved.\n\n\nThe role of theory is to give quantitative predictions of the\nphysical variables that make a system behave in one way rather than another,\nand ultimately with the use of such theory, to control or modify processes in\ndesirable ways.\n\n\n RADIATION EFFECTS IN NON-METALLIC SOLIDS \n\n\nIn interactions of radiation with non-metallic solids, the energy\npossessed by incident particles is transformed into the electronic excitation\nenergy and lattice energy 1.\n\n\nThe lattice energy causes displacements of atoms from perfect sites\nand enhances thermal vibrations.\n\n\nThe electronic excitation energy can ( i) excite an electron from the\ncore ( generate a core-hole) to the conduction band ( ii) generate a hole in\nthe valence band and electrons in conduction bands.\n\n\nThe density of valence - electron excitation can be quite high.\n\n\nThe de-excitation from electronically excited states can produce\nvacancies and interstitials and even removal of the surface atoms in alkali\nhalides.\n\n\nHowever, in ordinary valence-electron excitation, no atomic processes\nare induced in most of the semiconductors.\n\n\n SELF-TRAPPED EXCITONS IN ALKALI HALIDES \n\n\nIn the perfect crystal, the halide ions are in closed-shell\nconfigurations and so if they are brought together there is no net bonding.\n\n\nIf a hole is trapped on a pair of halide ions, an antibonding orbital\nis left only partially occupied, and net bonding occurs.\n\n\nThe result is that the self-trapping distortion involves the approach\nof two halide X-ions to form an effective ( X2)-molecule within the crystal\nand is strongly favoured energetically.\n\n\nThe field of the self-trapped hole or VK centre is sufficient to bind\nan electron in a more diffuse S-like state and is termed self-trapped exciton\n2.\n\n\nIn its ground state the hole is effectively immobilized, self-trapped\nby the formation of a molecular ion.\n\n\nSelf-trapped excitons are typically formed in a state where either\nthe electron or the hole or both are excited.\n\n\nThese states are often denoted by the symbols [ e*h], [ eh*] and [\ne*h*] respectively.\n\n\nThe self-trapped exciton can recombine by the following mechanisms 3:\n\n\n( 1) non-radiative with lifetime of lO-l2 s, giving damage / defects;\n\n\n( 2) spin-allowed radiative ( a-luminesence) with radiative lifetime\nof 10_8 s;\n\n\n( 3) spin-forbidden radiative ( ++-luminesence) with radiative\nlifetime of 10-3 s; as well as a variety of non-radiative channels with a\nrange of lifetimes.\n\n\nIn the situation of high carrier densities, where the interaction\nbetween the single excitation events cannot be neglected, the recombination\nenergy may be transferred to the electronic degrees of freedom and hence the\ndefect is excited electronically.\n\n\nThe activation energy in an excited state is lower than the ground\nstate.\n\n\nExamples include the motion of self-trapped holes2 and vacancies in\nionic crystals 4.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, nonradiative recombination gives rise to defect\nproduction ( Fig 1) eg [ eh*] -F +H where the self-trapped excition is in\nits excited state.\n\n\nNo defect formation is possible from the ground-state self-trapped\nexciton.\n\n\nSuch a nonradiative recombination process may be a significant factor\nin the desorption of halogen atoms from alkali halide surfaces.\n\n\nThis is elaborated upon in the next section.\n\n\n DESORPTION INDUCED BY ELECTRONIC TRANSITIONS IN ALKALI HALIDES\n\n\n\nBasically, two types of models have been suggested to explain\ndesorption induced by two different types of excitation: the\nMenzel-Gomer-Redhead ( MGR) model for excitation of valence electrons and the\nKnotek-Feibelman ( KF) mechanism for excitation of core electrons.\n\n\nIn the MGR model, a Frank-Condon transition of valence electrona\ntakes a bonding state into an antibonding state.\n\n\nThe creation of this antibonding state leads to a competition between\nelectronic de-excitation and desorption.\n\n\nThe KF mechanism explains the desorption processes induced by\ncore-electron excitation and assumes that localised two holes produced in the\nvalence band due to Auger transition to a core hole lead to emission of ions\nresulting from Coulomb repulsion.\n\n\nHere desorption predominates if the lifetime of the repulsive\nlocalised two holes is sufficiently long.\n\n\nIt has been suggested that this condition is satisfied if the\nhole-hole correlation energy ( U) is larger than the valence bandwidth ( W).\n\n\nThe localisation, however, is not a sufficient condition for\ndesorption to occur.\n\n\nThe desorption process is also affected by the coordination number as\nwell as the type of bonding.\n\n\nFor alkali halides and alkali-earth fluorides electron-lattice\ncoupling is strong and therefore excitons and holes may be localised.\n\n\nThus self-trapping of excitons provides a site for the localisation\nof the energy possessed by an exciton.\n\n\nHowever, a self-trapped exciton is structurally unstable and would\ndecay to a vacancy and interstitial atom.\n\n\nTherefore a self-trapped exciton near the surface may eventually\nbecome a halogen ion vacancy and an emitted halogen atom.\n\n\nThe energy possessed by localised excitons is converted partly to the\nkinetic energy of atoms being emitted.\n\n\nThe mechanism of desorption of halogen atom induced by\nvalence-electron excitation is therefore an example of MGR mechanism.\n\n\nIn MGR mechanism, the yield of the desorption is proportional to the\nnumber of excitations of the valence electrons.\n\n\n LASER SPUTTERING FROM GaP \n\n\n 1) Experimental results \n\n\nExperimental results from Itoh\'s group6 on laser induced sputtering\nof GaP can be summarized as follows ( Fig 2):\n\n\n( 1) There is a threshold fluence for desorption and sputtering yield\nvaries as a power law with laser fluence.\n\n\nThe threshold fluence is wavelength dependent.\n\n\nThe power law relation indicates that single excitation of surfaces\ndoes not lead to desorption but the interaction between excitation is needed\nfor desorption, unlike that for alkali halides.\n\n\n( 2) The change of the sputtering yield of Ga induced by repeated\nlaser irradiation on the same spot is as follows: For low fluence, the LEED\npattern does not change and the sputtering yield decreases rapidly at the\nbeginning of the irradiation and becomes a constant.\n\n\nFor high fluence, the LEED spot is fading and the sputtering yield\nincreases as pulsed irradiation is repeated.\n\n\n 2) Defect-initiated particle emission from GaP ( 110) surfaces\n\n\n\nIn order to understand the experimental results, we perform a\nsemi-empirical quantum mechanical calculation of the energy needed to eject a\nGa or P atom7 from several types of defect sites on the GaP ( 110) surface.\n\n\nThe results are summarized in Table 1.\n\n\nEnergy ( eV) needed to remove a Ga atom or P atom from various defect\nsites on surfaces. \n\n\nDefect type Ga@ perfect site vacancies Ga vacancy P vacancy Ga-P\ndivacancy step site adatoms 2.67 2.82 2.98 2.40 1.46 2.59 1.32 2 2.31 3 Ga\nadatom P adatom anti-sites Ga(P) 2.58 P(Ga) .15 .61 2.06 4.20 \n\n\nOur results show that desorption of Ga or P atoms from the perfect\nsites generally require higher energies compared with those from defect\nsites.\n\n\nThe results confirm that defect-initiated particle desorption\ndominates over the desorption from the perfect sites.\n\n\nIt is shown that the energy for desorption of a Ga atom from an\nadatom is smaller than that from a step.\n\n\nExperimental observation shows that the sputtering yield decreases as\nthe number of laser shots on the same spot increases when the fluence is\nbelow a damage threshold.\n\n\nIt can be attributed to Ga atom desorbing from the adatom site.\n\n\nThe adatom will be eliminated by laser irradiation.\n\n\nWhen the number of step sites is infinite on the surface, the\nsputtering yield will remain constant as the number of laser shots increases.\n\n\nWe now examine the results for vacancies.\n\n\nIf a P vacancy exists on the surface, a Ga atom is desorbed with a\nless energy than a P atom from its nearest neighbour, forming a Ga-P\ndivacancy.\n\n\nSince desorption of both Ga and P atoms near the divacancy involves\nrelatively low binding energies, emission of another atom will occur\nsubsequently.\n\n\nWe may expect that desorption of a P atom from a Ga-P-Ga trivacancy\nand of a Ga atom from P-Ga-P vacancy to proceed with less energy.\n\n\nSimilarly if a Ga vacancy exists on the surface, a vacancy cluster\nwill evolve after a P atom is emitted.\n\n\nThe calculations illustrate that the laser ablation could be\ninitiated by vacancies on surfaces.\n\n\nThe evolution of the vacancy cluster can also penetrate deep into the\nsurface layers.\n\n\nBased on the above results, we suggest a mechanism to generate "\ndefect-free" perfect surfaces based on repetition of the following 2\nprocedures: deposition of constituent atoms to eliminate vacancies on the\nsurface and laser-irradiation to eliminate steps and adatoms.\n\n\n 3) Mechanism for desorption: multi-hole excitation \n\n\nRelaxation of a lattice, induced by formation of a hole and multi -\nholes on defects on a surface of GaP, has been investigated by Khoo et al.\n\n\nIt is shown that hole localisation on a surface atoms constituting\nthe defect induces catastrophic behaviour.\n\n\nThe lack of symmetry for atoms on the surface exhibits a variety of\nfeatures of coupling of the lattice with electronic excitations.\n\n\nFor the case of an adatom ( Fig 3), a single ionization induces a\nmetastable state and the second excitation breaks the bond.\n\n\nFor the case of Ga antisite ( Fig 4) where a defect with trapped\nholes is located near the surface, an excitation causes the transfer of the\nhole to the surface atom inducing an intermediate state in which the surface\natom is bonded weakly.* This weakly bonded intermediate state can be\nre-excited further and the bond for the surface atom is finally broken,\nleading to desorption.\n\n\nThe initial state ( Sl) of the Ga antisite defect located just below\nthe surface is a negative -u state.\n\n\nIn the bulk, excitation would lead to the production of a metastable\nstate higher in energy.\n\n\nHowever, our results suggest that at the surface, because of lack of\nsymmetry, excitation may lead to the production of a stable intermediate\nstate lower in energy ( S2).\n\n\nThe appearance of this non-negative u state is therefore only for\ncases where there is a symmetry. \n\n\n\n\n D SEROEPIDEMIOLOGY OF CYTOMEGALOVIRUS INFECTION \n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n\nCytomegalovirus ( CMV) infection is usually asymptomatic.\n\n\nHowever, it can present with a wide spectrum of disease\nmanifestations including severe congenital malformation, a mononucleosis\nsyndrome in adolescents and young adults, and fatal disseminated infection in\nimmunocompromised persons.\n\n\nFollowing primary infection, the virus becomes latent and may\nreactivate to cause recurrent infection, especially in bone marrow and kidney\ntransplant recipients.\n\n\nThe virus is excreted in urine, saliva, breast milk, cervical\nsecretions and faeces.\n\n\nTransmission occurs vertically from mother to child and horizontally\nby intimate contact with an infectious person.\n\n\nAs viraemia may also be present in asymptomatic persons, primary\ninfection can follow blood transfusion.\n\n\nA seroepidemiological survey was conducted in 1990 to determine the\nprevalence of CMV infection in Singapore.\n\n\nBlood samples were collected from apparently healthy infants and\nchildren who were being followed up for routine health assessment at a\npostnatal clinic, women attending government antenatal clinics, and blood\ndonors.\n\n\nSera were analysed for IgG antibodies to CMV by enzyme immunoassay\nat the Virus Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital.\n\n\n RESULTS \n\n\nA total of 500 persons comprising 288 males and 212 females between\n6 months and 45+ years of age were tested.\n\n\nOf these, 327 ( 65.4%) possessed antibodies to CMV.\n\n\nThe seroprevalence increased wih age from 32% in young children\nbelow 5 years of age to 53%-66% in older children and teenagers 5-19 years\nof age, and to 86%-94% in adults above 20 years of age ( Fig 6.10). \n\n\nFemales had a higher prevalence than males ( 73.6% and 59.4%,\nrespectively) ( Table 6.1), with the greatest difference in adolescents and\nyoung adults between 15 and 24 years of age ( females 94%, males 58%, odds\nratio 11.3; 95% confidence interval 2.8-37.5).\n\n\nThe ethnic-specific prevalence rate of Indians ( 82.8%) was higher\nthan that of Chinese ( 63.4%), Malays ( 71.2%) and others ( 66.7%), but the\ndifferences were not statistically significant Table 6.2).', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'A Glimpse at the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type I ( HIV-I) \n\n\nHong Saw See\n\n\nDepartment of Biochemistry\n\n\nNational University of Singapore\n\n\nThe human immunodeficiency virus type I ( HIV) has been etiologically\nidentified as the primary cause of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (\nAIDS) [ 1,2].\n\n\nHIV-I is the prototypical member of the Lentivirinae subfamily of\nretroviruses affecting humans.\n\n\nThe lentiviruses characteristically cause indolent infections in their\nanimal hosts and these infections commonly involve the nervous system,\nproducing long periods of clinical latency, and weak humoral immune\nresponses.\n\n\nGlobally, the World Health Organization estimates that 6 to 8 million\npeople are currently infected with HIV-I and it is predicted that 15 to 20\nmillion people will be seropositive for the virus by the year 2000 [ 3].\n\n\nHIV-I is spread by sexual contact, exposure to infected blood or blood\nproducts, and perinatal transmission from mother to child.\n\n\nClearly, AIDS represents an international health crisis, and the\ndevelopment of drug therapies and effective vaccines depends substantially on\na more complete understanding of this pathogenic retrovirus.\n\n\n The HIV-I Genomic Structure and Virion \n\n\nMost retroviruses that are capable of replication contain only three\ngenes - namely, gag, pol and env [ 4].\n\n\nThe gag and env genes encode the core nucleocapsid polypeptides and\nsurface-coat proteins of the virus, respectively, while the pol gene gives\nrise to the viral reverse transcriptase and other enzymes.\n\n\nHIV-I, however, contains in its 9 kilobase RNA genome, not only these\nthree essential genes but at least six additional regulatory genes ( vif,\nvpu, vpr, tat, rev and nef) [ Figure 1].\n\n\nIt is the concerted action of these additional genes that probably\nunderlie the profound pathogenicity of HIV-I.\n\n\nHigh resolution electron microscopy has revealed the HIV-I virion as\nan icosahedral structure containing 72 external spikes.\n\n\nThese spikes are formed by the two major envelope proteins, gp 120\nand gp4 1 [ Figure 2].\n\n\nThe core of HIV-I contains four nucleocapsid proteins,p17,p24,p9 and\np7.\n\n\nThe p24 protein forms the chief component of the inner leaflet of the\nnucleocapsid, whereas the myristylated pl7 protein is associated with the\ninner surface of the lipid bilayer.\n\n\nThe p7 protein binds directly to the genomic RNA through a\nzinc-finger structural motif and together with p9 forms the nucleoid core.\n\n\n Life cycle of HIV-I \n\n\nThe first step in the infectious cycle of HIV-I involves the\nattachment of the virion to a target cell.\n\n\nThe human CD4+ T lymphocytes and monocytes are the major cellular\ntargets [ 5].\n\n\nHIV-I specifically infects these cells because the CD4 membrane\nantigen represents the principal, if not sole high-affinity cellular receptor\nfor this retrovirus.\n\n\nThe HIV-I gp l20 envelope protein is found to bind to CD4 with\nstrikingly high affinity.\n\n\nThe role of CD4 as the viral receptor has prompted considerable\ninterest in the therapeutic use of soluble CD4 protein as " receptor decoys"\nto block HIV-I infection [ 6].\n\n\nRecent studies, however, show that primary viral isolates are\nresistant to such soluble CD4 analogues.\n\n\nOther problems encountered with short biological half-life and poor\ntissue penetration limit the usefulness of soluble CD4 as an antiviral agent.\n\n\nBesides T-cells and monocytes, HIV-I may also infect other types of\ncells, including glial cells, gut epithelium and bone marrow progenitors.\n\n\nWhether HIV-I infection of these diverse cell types is mediated\nexclusively through CD4 or involves another cellular receptor remains an area\nof active investigation.\n\n\n Internalization and reverse transcription \n\n\nThe HIV-I virion is brought inside the cell via virus-mediated\nmembranefusion [ 7], a process involving the viral gp4 1 envelope protein.\n\n\nAfter internalization, the HIV-I virion is rapidly uncoated and\nenters the replicative phase of its life cycle.\n\n\nViral replication begins with the generation of first-strand DNA copy\nof the viral RNA by the viral reverse transcriptase.\n\n\nSecond-strand DNA synthesis then proceeds after the viral\nribonuclease H digests the original RNA template yielding a The most\nsuccessful therapeutic drugs used in the treatment of HIV-I infection are\ndideoxynucleosides, agents which specifically inhibit the action of the viral\nreverse transcriptase [ 8].\n\n\nThese compounds include 3\'azido-2\', 3\'-dideoxythymidine ( zidovudine,\nAZT), 2\'3\'dideoxycytidine ( ddC) and 2\'3\'dideoxyinosine ( ddI).\n\n\nEach of these compounds is phosphorylated to an active triphosphate\nform after entry into the cell and acts either as a chain terminator of the\nfirst strand DNA or as a simple competitor to the normal deoxynucleoside - 5 \'\n- triphosphate.\n\n\nThe viral reverse transcriptase appears to incorporate these\ndideoxynucleoside analogues preferentially, thus explaining their therapeutic\neffectiveness.\n\n\nZidovudine has been shown to prolong survival and reduce the\nfrequency and severity of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS.\n\n\n Viral Latency \n\n\nUpon entry into a susceptible cell, HIV-I may establish a latent or\npersistent form of infection.\n\n\nIt has been estimated that for every T-cell actively producing the\nvirus, nine other T-cells contain the latent virus.\n\n\nThe biochemical basis of this apparent viral latency is poorly\nunderstood but may be determined by the overall state of cellular activation.\n\n\nMany viruses, including HIV-I, do not replicate in resting T-cells,\npresumably because critical host factors are absent.\n\n\nHowever, the activation of these T-cells by antigens, mitogens,\ncytokines ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-l) or gene products of\nother viruses ( human T-cell leukemia virus type l, herpes simplex virus,\nhuman herpes virus type 6) creates a permissive environment for HIV-I\nreplication 191.\n\n\nThese activating agents are known to induce the expression of host\ntranscription factors, initiatung cell growth and thus, HIV-I replication.\n\n\n Morphogenesis of the HIV-I Virion \n\n\nAssembly of the HIV virion proceeds via a stepwise manner, involving\naggregation of the nbonucleoprotein core in the cytoplasm.\n\n\nThe gene products of the gag and pol genes, together with the vital\nRNA form the core of the mature virion.\n\n\nOnce assembled, these cores move to the cell surface and bud through\nthe plasma membrane, where they acquire their envelope proteins, gene\nproducts of the env gene.\n\n\nDuring the budding process, a series of cleavage events occur,\nmediated by the HIV-I protease.\n\n\nThe Gag polyprotein is cleaved to yield the pl7, p24, p9 and p7\nproteins, and the pol gene precursor cleaved to produce the viral enzymes,\nthe reverse transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease and protease.\n\n\nThe HIV-I protease has long been the target of investigators working\non antiviral therapeutic agents.\n\n\nThe protease protein has been purified and crystallised [ l0], and\nits intrinsic three dimensional structural information has been used in the\nrational development of specific inhibitors.\n\n\n Development of an HIV-I vaccine \n\n\nEarly studies in the field of vaccine development for HIV-I have\nshown that the successful design of a vaccine would be complicated by the\nsequence variation of the Env protein.\n\n\nThe hyperimmunization of chimpanzees with HIV-I Env protein was\ninsufficient to protect the animals from challenge with even small quantities\nof the same strain of HIV-I [ ll].\n\n\nAlthough these initial results seemed discouraging,later studies in\nthe SIV-I ( Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1) system suggest that an\neffective HIV-I vaccine may be an achievable goal.\n\n\nInactivated whole-virus-based SIV-I vaccines can confer protective\nimmunity on Rhesus monkeys challenged with low doses of live SIV-I [ l2].\n\n\nHowever, concerns about insufficient inactivation and inadequate\nanimal models for safety testing restrict the use of whole inactivated HIV in\nseronegative humans.\n\n\nMost efforts to date, have therefore been focussed on subunit\nvaccines.\n\n\nRecently, protective immunity was observed in macaques immunised with\nrecombinant vaccinia virus expressing SIV-env protein, boosted with Env\nprotein produced in baculovirus-infected cells [ 13].\n\n\nA similar combination immunization approach is now under evaluation\nin humans as a candidate AIDS vaccine [ 14].\n\n\nIt remains to be shown, however, whether recombinant subunit vaccines\ncan protect against heterologous virus challenge. \n\n\n\n\n Advances in Malarial Research \n\n\nTeo Tian Seng and Catherine Ng\n\n\nDepartment of Biochemistry National University of Singapore\n\n\nThe Plasmodium parasite, the causative agent of malaria, is a major\nscourge of mankind.\n\n\nSome 270 million people have been infected with malaria during the\npast 20 years and more than a million people die of it every year.\n\n\nAs early as the seventeenth century, extracts from the bark of the\ncinchona tree were known to be effective in the treatment of the disease.\n\n\nIn the 19th century, quinine, a quinoline alkaloid, was identified as\nthe active antimalarial compound in the cinchona bark.\n\n\nQuinine was widely used until it was superseded by chloroquine which\nwas first synthesized by Resochin in Germany in 1934.\n\n\nChloroquine is the single most successful anti-malarial drug ever\ndeveloped and has been credited with saving the lives of countless millions\nof people.\n\n\nDespite the enormous benefits derived from its use over the past half\ncentury, its mechanism of action had been a mystery.\n\n\nA significant breakthrough in the war against malaria was the\npublication of a recent report by Slater and Cerami ( Nature 355; 167-169,\n1992) which revealed the mechanism of action of the drug.\n\n\nThis discovery may revolutionize the way in which future\nanti-malarial drugs will be developed.\n\n\nThe life cycle of the Plasmodium parasite consists of a sexual phase\nin the intestine of the mosquito and an asexual multiplication phase within\nthe liver parenchyma cells and the erythrocytes ofthe human host.\n\n\nChloroquine and related quinoline-containing anti-malarials are\neffective only against the intra-erythrocytic stages of the Plasmodium life\ncycle.\n\n\nRapid multiplication ofthe parasite within the erythrocytes results\nin a high demand for nutrients which are partly haemoglobin in acid food\nvacuoles of the parasites.\n\n\nHowever, the digestion of the abundant haemoglobin is not without its\ndrawbacks.\n\n\nBreakdown of haemoglobin releases large amounts of haem which is\ntoxic because it can damage biological membranes and inhibit a variety of\nenzymes.\n\n\nThe human host has an elaborate system in the reticuloendothelial\ncells of the liver, spleen and bone marrow for the degradation and excretion\nof haem.\n\n\nUnlike the human host, the parasite is unable to degrade and excrete\nhaem.\n\n\nIt can only sequester haem in its food vacuoles by incorporating it\ninto an insoluble crystalline material called haemozoin.\n\n\nHaemozoin is a polymer of haem formed by covalently linking the\ncentral ferric ion of one haem to a side-chain carboxylate oxygen of another.\n\n\nThis polymeric form of haem is harmless to the parasite.\n\n\nHowever, haem molecules do not spontaneously polymerise into\nhaemozoin under physiological conditions.\n\n\nThe polymerisation of haem into haemozoin requires an enzyme which\nSlater and Cerami identified in extracts of Plasmodium falciparum\ntrophozoites.\n\n\nThe pH optimum of the haem polymerase is between pH 5.0 and 6.0,\nwhich covers the estimated pH of the parasite\'s food vacuoles.\n\n\nThey observed that chloroquine and its analogs potently inhibited the\nactivity of the polymerase.\n\n\nInhibition of the polymerase occurred at a drug concentration and pH\nsimilar to that estimated in the parasite\'s food vacuoles.\n\n\nThe rank order of potencies by which different analogs of chloroquine\ninhibited the polymerase is also the same as the rank order of their\nanti-malarial activity.\n\n\nWith the discovery of the physiological target of the quinoline -\ncontaining anti-malarial drugs, the development of new drugs will now be\ngreatly facilitated.\n\n\nResearch can now be focused on the structural requirements for the\ninhibition of the haem polymerase.\n\n\nThis discovery is timely as there is now a resurgence in the\nworld-wide incidence of malaria.\n\n\nNew strains of mosquito vector resistant to insecticides and mutant\nforms of the malarial parasite resistant to drugs have contributed to the\ncurrent increase in malarial infection. \n\n\n\n\n Ferritin: Stucture, Function and Gene Regulation \n\n\nChew Li Jin\n\n\nInstitute of Molecular and Cell Biology\n\n\nNational University of Singapore\n\n\nIron under physiological conditions tends to hydrolyse and\npolymerise, forming essentially insoluble ferric hydroxides and\noxyhydroxides.\n\n\nTo maintain iron in a soluble form, biological systems possess\nspecial proteins which bind Fe ions with high affinity, leaving very little\nfree iron in solution.\n\n\nAn important example of such iron-binding proteins is ferritin, the\niron - storage protein found in both animals and plants.\n\n\nIt serves the dual function of maintaining iron in a biologically\navailable form and protecting the organism against the toxic effects of\nexcess iron.\n\n\nFor example, in mammalian systems, when iron is absorbed from the\nsmall intestine, it immediately combines with a b-globulin, apotransferrin,\nto form transferrin, which is circulated in the blood plasma.\n\n\nThe iron bound by transfenrin is in turn taken up by a wide range of\ncells, particularly in the liver, spleen and the intestinal mucosae, and is\neventually stored as ferritin within the cytoplasm. \n\n\n Ferritin Structure and Function \n\n\nFerritin is formed from an iron core of ferric oxyhydroxide\ncrystals and a 24-subunit coat of non-heme proteins called apoferritin.\n\n\nThe apoferritin subunits may vary in amino acid sequence and\npolypeptide chain length ( 174 to 183 residues), thus contributing to the\ncomplexity and heterogeniety in the structure and composition of the\napoferritin macromolecule.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

{'text': "CONSERVATION PROPOSAL FOR PULAU UBIN \n\n\nby Lim Kim Keang\n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n\nWith the increasing need for nature-oriented activities in an affluent\nsociety and the world-wide trend in eco-tourism, there is a strong case for\nmaintaining Pulau Ubin as a nature reserve-cum-adventure island to complement\nthe intensive urbanised entertainment facilities provided on Sentosa.\n\n\nPulau Ubin presents a unique opportunity to conserve the last\nremaining large island with a diverse range of habitats, including natural\nareas such as sandy and rocky shores, mangroves, estuaries and secondary\nforests and man-made areas like fish and prawn ponds, farms, orchards,\nabandoned quarries, disused farmland and plantations.\n\n\nIt is the only remaining extensive rural landscape with residents\nliving in a kampong setting.\n\n\nMuch of the island will continue to support the typical as well as the\nendangered flora and fauna if sufficient safe-guards are implemented to\nensure that only appropriate developments and activities are permitted.\n\n\nThere is much scope for creative management and usage of the abandoned\nplantations and barren extents of land in the vicinity of disused quarries.\n\n\nIt is of great importance therefore to have an overall plan for the\ndevelopment of the island so that its intrinsic value can be retained and its\npotential for nature and outdoor recreation can be optimally realised.\n\n\n LOCATION AND EXTENT \n\n\nPulau Ubin is to the north-east of the main island of Singapore.\n\n\nIt lies off the coast of Changi and is within the Straits of Johore.\n\n\nIt extends from 1 deg 26' N 103&degree; 56'E to 1&degree\n\n24' N 103&degree 59.5'E and has\nan area of 1019 hectares.\n\n\nIt i easily accessible from Changi Jetty by boat - - - the ride being\nabout 15 minutes.\n\n\n General Description \n\n\nThe island is elongated in shape.\n\n\nIt is generally hilly in the eastern and western zones and low and\nswampy in the central zone.\n\n\nThe western zone remains undeveloped with prominent hilly features\nsuch as Bukit Tajam ( 56m) and Bukit Tinggi ( 58m).\n\n\nMost of the other hills of the island have been quarried or levelled.\n\n\nThe abandoned quarries have become stagnant deep pools, with some\nquarry bottoms reaching well below sea level.\n\n\nQuarrying operations are being phased out and only two belonging to\nthe Resources Development Corporation are currently still functioning.\n\n\nThe central zone is dominated by a series of prawn and fish ponds\ntogether with riverine and remnant mangroves.\n\n\nThere are extensive abandoned plantations of rubber, coconut palms\nand fruit trees.\n\n\nMany of these areas are becoming scrubland and will eventually become\nsecondary forests.\n\n\nThe largest extent of sandy coast is in the east and south-east\nshores.\n\n\nMangroves line the estauries and many of the tidal inlets as well as\nsome extent of the northern coastline.\n\n\nThe western zone has some natural steep slopes and rocky shores.\n\n\nFew natural streams exist.\n\n\nBesides the large bodies of fresh water found in the disused\nquarries, there are very few shallow ponds.\n\n\nThe only reliable sources of water are wells.\n\n\nPlease see the Map attached.\n\n\n 1) WESTERN Zone \n\n\nThis is an ornithologically important area as it is the major habitat\nof the Red Jungle Fowl ( Gallus gallus), an endangered resident bird that\ncannot be found anywhere else in Singapore.\n\n\nThis is a colourful ancestor of the domestic fowl and is normally\nfound in jungles and adjoining areas away from human habitations.\n\n\nThere are two main areas within this zone with significant wildlife.\n\n\nArea A includes the two main forested hills on the island and Area B\nis an interesting mangrove area.\n\n\n Area A \n\n\nThe only two significant forested hills provide the main habitat for\nthe Red Jungle Fowl.\n\n\nBukit Tajam is believed to hold up to 60 of these birds which is\nperhaps the largest population of this endangered species in Singapore.\n\n\nBreeding records have been confirmed and these birds can be regularly\nobserved here.\n\n\nThe coastal areas adjoining the northern slopes of Bukit Tajam are\nimportant foraging grounds for this species.\n\n\nAnother rarity that has been recorded here is the Ruby-cheeked\nSunbird ( Anthreptes singalensis) which is usually confined to less disturbed\nlowland forests.\n\n\nBukit Tinggi has thickly forested slopes and a mature stand of\nrattans at the base fringing the mangroves along Sungei Teris.\n\n\nSuch mature stands are rarely found elsewhere in Singapore.\n\n\nBesides supporting a viable population of Red Jungle Fowl, this area\nmay be an important foraging area for the Green Imperial Pigeon ( Ducula\naenea).\n\n\nThis is a large pigeon mainly encountered in coastal lowland forests.\n\n\nThe forests also support Abbott's Babblers ( Trichastoma abbotti) and\nMagpie Robins ( Copsychus saularis).\n\n\nThe latter is highly vulnerable because of its popularity as a caged\nbird.\n\n\nThe destruction of its habitats and trapping have practically brought\nit close to extinction in other parts of Singapore.\n\n\n Area B \n\n\nThis is a major mangrove swamp, adjacent to the forested hills.\n\n\nAbout 16 hectares in extent, it is spread out on both banks of the\nSungei Assam and contains such mangrove plant species as Rhizophora apiculata\nand Sonneratia alba.\n\n\nThe endangered Manrove Pitta ( Pitta megarhyncha), which is extinct\non Singapore Island, has been observed in this site.\n\n\nThis beautiful bird is now confined to Pulau Tekong and this island.\n\n\nAnother endangered bird found here and also usually associated with\nmangroves is the White-chested Babbler ( Trichastoma rostratum).\n\n\nThe largest kingfisher in Singapore, the Stork-billed Kingfisher (\nPelargopsis capensis) is also at home here.\n\n\n Threats to the Western Zone \n\n\nThe projected construction of the new Outward Bound School and other\nexpansion projects can pose serious threats to this major wildlife habitat.\n\n\nThe encroachment into the foraging and breeding grounds during the\nconstruction stage and subsequent intrusion when the ground-living Red Jungle\nFowl are raising chicks are likely to have serious consequences.\n\n\nWe are not against the construction of the new Outward Bound School.\n\n\nCareful planning is required.\n\n\nIt is recommended that the expansion be limited to the existing open\nground, leaving the forested slope of Tajam intact as much as possible.\n\n\nThe buildings should be inconspicuous and should harmonize with the\nforest.\n\n\nThere is also a potential threat from the smallholders engaged in\nfruit tree cultivation and vegetable farming expanding into the forests and\nabandoned rubber plantations.\n\n\nResidents have also thinned out the forests here by cutting for\nfirewood and other purposes .\n\n\nHikers and mountain bikers too have intensified the thinning process\nby indiscriminately bashing through the forest, instead of following existing\ntrails.\n\n\n 2) CENTRAL ZONE \n\n\nThe Central Zone has a diverse range of habitats including fruit\norchards, mangroves, abandoned rubber and coconut plantations, scrubland and\nsecondary forests.\n\n\nThe many fish and prawn ponds are prominent features of this zone.\n\n\nThis diversity supports a large variety of animals typical of each\nhabitat.\n\n\nMany small mammals, reptiles and amphibians of open country habitat\nand wooded areas are surviving well.\n\n\nMany of the common butterflies associated with the rural areas are\nable to thrive here because of the variety of plants available.\n\n\nThere are five key areas in this zone that have significant\npopulation of common as well as rare wildlife.\n\n\n Area C \n\n\nThis area includes the former Kampong Noordin and has the only sandy\nbeach of recreational value on the island.\n\n\nIt is a popular picnic site for weekend visitors and a favoured\ndestination for campers.\n\n\nIt contains the largest area of mangroves, about 195 hectares in\nextent, spread mainly around Sungei Besar and Sungei Batu Kekek.\n\n\nAlthough extensively exploited for fish farming and timber\nextraction, large areas have been reclaimed by regenerating mangroves.\n\n\nOld mature stands contain mainly Rhizophora apiculata with some\nAvicennia lanata, Avicennia officinalis and Bruguiera species.\n\n\nThe regenerating mangrove is mostly made up of Lumnitzera and\nRhizophora apiculata.\n\n\nElevated mud-mount system built by the mud lobster, Thalassinia, is\nmuch evident in the area.\n\n\nThese extensive riverine mangroves constitute a major habitat for the\nCopper-throated Sunbird ( Nectarinia calcostetha), a brilliantly coloured and\nactive bird that is often seen feeding amongst the flowers of the mangroves.\n\n\nThis is another attractive mangrove species that is becoming\nincreasingly rare because of habitat destruction elsewhere.\n\n\nAnother threatened bird is the Straw-headed Bulbul ( Pycnonotus\nzeylanicus), the largest bulbul in South-east Asia, which has a viable\npopulation at this site.\n\n\nIt is a species normally associated with coastal and riverine forest\n( usually freshwater).\n\n\nIt does not seem to have any known breeding record outside Pulau\nUbin.\n\n\nThe small extent of abandoned rubber plantation and fruit trees\nappear to be suitable to the attractive Laced Woodpecker ( Picus vittatus),\nanother threatened species more common here than in the rest of Singapore.\n\n\n Area D \n\n\nThis area centres around the durian orchard and abandoned rambutan\nplantation.\n\n\nAn endangered small bird-of-prey, the Crested Goshawk ( Accipiter\ntrivirgatus) is a resident here.\n\n\nDuring the migrating season several migrant raptors roost here\nincluding Chinese Goshawk ( Accipiter soloensis) and Black Baza ( Aviceda\nleuphotes).\n\n\nOne of the prettiest birds in Singapore, the Common Goldenback (\nDinopium javanense), is commonly encountered here.\n\n\nLong-tailed Parakeets ( Psittacula longicauda) are frequent nesters\nin holes of the older durian trees.\n\n\nBats including the Malayan Flying Fox are probably more abundant here\nthan other parts of the island.\n\n\nOther mammals include the House Musang which is still holding out in\nthis area.\n\n\nSmaller mammals such as House Shrews can often be encountered in the\nabandoned plantations.\n\n\nReptiles such as the Garden and Sun Skink are also common.\n\n\nThe interesting Flying Lizard which feeds exclusively on ants\nfavoured the orchards and abandoned plantations.\n\n\nMonitor Lizards may be frequently observed in this area.\n\n\n Area E \n\n\nThis is an extensive area of prawn ponds with small stands of\nmangroves.\n\n\nThe bunds are important roosting sites for shorebirds during high\ntides.\n\n\nA fair number of them are regularly observed, including Pacific\nGolden Plover ( Plovialis fulva), Mongolian Plover ( Charadrius mongolus),\nCommon Redshank ( Tringa totanus), Common Greenshank ( Tringa nebularia) and\nother migrant waders.\n\n\nDuring ebb tide, some of these birds will be joined by Little Egrets\n( Egretta garzetta), Great Egret ( Egretta alba), Little Heron ( Butorides\nstriatus) and Pacific Reef Egret ( Egretta sacra) when feeding on the exposed\nmudflats.\n\n\n Area F \n\n\nThe abandoned rubber plantation of Sam Heng Estate is the only known\nroost of the resident pair of Buffy Fish-Owl ( Ketupa ketupu) in Singapore.\n\n\nThe birds feed in the nearby prawn ponds and rivers at night and\nroost in the rubber trees during the day.\n\n\nThe riverine mangroves here also provide a habitat for the\nStrawheaded Bulbul.\n\n\nTwo uncommon cuckoos, the Plaintive Cuckoo ( Cacomantis merulinus)\nand Indonesian Cuckoo ( Cacomantis variolosus) have been observed here.\n\n\n Area G \n\n\nThis area includes the last remaining Malay kampong in Singapore,\nKampong Melayu.\n\n\nThe most important habitat is the nipah palm forest, a very rare\nhabitat that is almost completely gone from Singapore.\n\n\nTogether with the adjoining mangroves, it is a refuge for the\nRuby-cheeked Sunbird and another uncommon mangrove specialist, the Mangrove\nWhistler ( Pachycephala cinerea).\n\n\nThe nearby ponds are believed to have one of the largest populations\nof Pacific Reef Egrets in Singapore.\n\n\nThis area has a small population of the White-rumped Munia (\nLonchura stirata), a rare species whose other known locaton is Pulau Tekong.\n\n\nIt haunts the grassy and shrubby patches.\n\n\n 3) EASTERN ZONE ( Area H) \n\n\nThe Eastern Zone consists mainly of abandoned coconut and rubber\nplantations.\n\n\nThere is a record of a Buffy Fish owl in the rubber plantation\ntowards the eastern end.\n\n\nThis large zone requires further surveys to fully realise its\npotential value.\n\n\nIt can be expected to hold significant animal populations as it is\nsubjected to much less disturbances than the other areas.\n\n\nThere is a fair extent of mangroves with some nipah palms that is\nfrequented by a small troop of Long-tailed Macaques ( Macaca fascicularis).\n\n\nThe presence of nipah palms merits its conservation.\n\n\nThis is an increasing rare type of coastal wetland habitat which is\nhas been cleared completely from most other areas.\n\n\n- There is a mudflat on the north-eastern coast that attracts a\nlarge number of migrant waders.\n\n\nThere is also an extensive sandy beach of both coarse and fine\nparticles which is attractive to shorebirds.\n\n\nThe islet just off the north-eastern shore is known to be a nesting\nground for the Black-naped Tern ( Sterna sumatrana) and is highly vulnerable\nto disturbance and predation by casual fishermen. \n\n\nThis is only the second confirmed nesting site of this uncommon\nresident tern.\n\n\nThere are also unconfirmed reports of the Blue-winged and the\nMangrove Pitta, the latter a rare resident species, within this zone.\n\n\nA thorough survey will probably yield significant results.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

villi which arc lined by hyperplastic syncytio-cytotrophoblast;\nthese are androgenetic in origin with two sets of paternal genome.\n\n\nAlmost 95% of moles are XX; 5% are XY, and rarely they may be\ntetraploid.\n\n\nTetraploid cell lines may occur within diploid moles.\n\n\nA partial hydatidiform mole is characterized by focal molar change,\nthe villi showing focal hyperplasia, scalloped outlines and vascularization\nin various degrees of collapse.\n\n\nThe sac is usually empty. \n\n\nTable 1 Gestational trophoblastic disease, ( World Health Organsation\nDefinitions) Begnin ( 1) Complete hydratidiform mole ( 2) Partial (\nhydatidiform mole) Gestional trophoblastic tumours ( 1)Invasive/ Metastatic\nmole ( 2) Choriocarcinoma ( 3)Placental site trophoblastic tumour \n\n\nIf present, the fetus show multiple anomalies characteristic of\ntriploidy because the partial mole is a triploid conceptus 3.\n\n\nChoriocarcilloma is a malignant tumor of the trophoblast\ncharacterized by complete absence of villi.\n\n\nAn invasive tumour showing villi formation is an invasive mole.\n\n\nThe placental site trophoblastic tumour ( PSTT) is a rare lesion\ncharacterized by cytotrophoblast and a few syncytiotrophoblast which invade\nthe myometrium; a small number of cells stain for human chorionic\ngonadotropin ( hCG) and circulating hCG is low; most cells stain for human\nplacental lactogen ( hPL).\n\n\nPSTT may be preceded by pregnancy or hydatidiform mole.\n\n\n INCIDENCE \n\n\nThe risk of molar pregnancy is highest after age 45 and in the teens,\nand is rarest in pregnancies occurring between 25 and 39 years 6.\n\n\nHospital-based studies give the impression that gestational\ntrophoblastic disease is very common in Third World countries, but\npopulation-based studies in Singapore and China demonstrated an incidence of\none in a thousand pregnancies - about twice the incidence in the West 7,8.\n\n\nDelayed childbearing in any country may produce a change in incidence\nif the agerelated frequency is consistent.\n\n\nUnreliable data collection and differing approaches negate the value\nof studying the trends in most countries.\n\n\nTriploidy is fouud in 1-2%, of abortuses, and 80% of triploids are\nsaid to beeome partial moles.\n\n\nHowever, the discovered clinical incidence is much lower 2.\n\n\nThe risk of sequelae in hydatidiform mole is variously reported as\n22%.\n\n\nOur local experience during the 1960s showed that when a mole was\nfirst diagnosed, 10% already showed evidence of invasive mole, i.e.\n\n\nonly 3-8% of \'benign\' moles eventually develop residual trophoblastie\ndisease or choriocarcinoma 9.\n\n\nResidual trophoblastic disease may be recognized by four features: a\nregression curve pattern; any detectable hCG after 12 weeks; a rise or\nplateau in hCG; and clinical and radiological evidence with hCG"\'".\n\n\nIf B-hCG is negative ( less than 5miu/ml) at 8 weeks, the risk of\nresidual trophoblastie disease is 1:1000 or lower\'2.\n\n\nCurrent enzymeimmunoassay methods are now capable of detecting 20\nmiu/ml of hCG, and should be employed in those entrees that have no access to\nradioimmunoassay techniques.\n\n\nIn women aged 40 and above, the risk of sequelae was fouud by S.H.Tow\nto be 1: 3:3(13).\n\n\nThe events in the natural history of gestational trophoblastic\ndisease with their incidences are summarized in Figure 1.\n\n\n HYDATIDIFORM MOLE \n\n\nThe commonest presentation of hydatidiform mole is irregular vaginal\nbleeding following amenorrhoea and, in a full-blown mole, exaggeration of\npregnancy symptoms and signs.\n\n\nIn recent years, it has been more commonly picked up on early\npregnancy scans before any warning symptom or sign appears.\n\n\nIt is possible to make the diagnosis at 6-8 weeks, and ultrasound has\nrendered all other diagnostic tests obsolete.\n\n\nA hyperplastic placenta with an absent or grossly reduced amniotic\nsac should make one suspect hydatidiform mole before the appearance of the\ntypical bubbly vesicles: a rescan a week later will clinch the diagnosis.\n\n\nAnaemia and invasive disease need to be excluded before commencing\ntreatment.\n\n\nThe standard treatment is suction curettage.\n\n\nWe prefer to administer oxytoxics just prior to suction.\n\n\nBetween 15 and 20 % require a repeat curettage because of plateauing\nhCG, bleeding or subinvolution, and 20% of such patients will eventually\nrequire chelllotherapy 14.\n\n\nProphylactic chemotherapy is not advocated, but residual or invasive\nmole must be diagnosed early and treated appropriately 6,l5.\n\n\nA routine repeat dilatation and curettage is also not advocated 6.\n\n\nHysterectomy is seldom necessary in modern practice, but may be\nconsidered in special circumstances if proper follow-up cannot be made.\n\n\nHysterectomy has a place in women over 40 years who have no plans for\nfurther childbearing.\n\n\nPatients with hydatidiform mole are reviewed weekly for 8 weeks,\nmonthly over the next 4 months, and twice a year thereafter.\n\n\nDuring the initial stages, abnormal bleeding or amenorrhoea is\nsignificant and clinical examination looks for subinvolution, ovarian cysts\nand vaginal nodules.\n\n\nSerum hCG is measured at each visit; the patient is given a chest\nradiograph if indicated, and a pelvic ultrasonograph if amenorrhoeic.\n\n\nThe complications of invasive/ metastatic mole are: uterine\nperforation, respiratory distress, cardiac failure, cerebral haemorrhage and\nprogression to choriocarcinoma 3.5.\n\n\nSuch complications occur more frequently if the uterus is larger than\nexpected at 24 weeks.\n\n\nOur studies in the 1960s showed that when invasive moles were\naggressively treated, the risk of eventual choriocarcinoma was reduced from\n5.85 to 1% 16.\n\n\nBetter results should be expected to today.\n\n\nSingle agent chemotherapy produces prompt remission in 95% of\ninvasive moles, and combination therapy, eg methotrexate, acthlonlycin-D and\nchorambucil ( MAC) will produce remission in the remainder.\n\n\nThe key is always early diagnosis.\n\n\n PLACENTAL SITE TROPHOBLASTIC TUMOUR ( PSTT) \n\n\nPSTT is difficult to diagnose and there is insufficient experience\nfor categorical statements on appropriate therapy.\n\n\nThe diagnosis is histological, coupled with low serum hCG.\n\n\nImmunocytocytochemistry and genetic fingerprinting distinguishes it\nfrom other germ cell tumours.\n\n\nThe mitotic count generally correlates well with prognosis.\n\n\nThe mortality rate is around 15 %.\n\n\nThe lesion is relatively chemoresistant although some cases have\nresponded to EMA/CO.\n\n\nTherefore hysterectomy is advocated 17.\n\n\nA nephrotic syndrome has been described with the disease.\n\n\n PREGNANCIES AFTER HYDATIDIFORM MOLE \n\n\nThere is a significant risk of recurrent hydatidiform mole variously\nreported to range between 1:38 and 1: 125 ( 13,18).\n\n\nThere is no increased risk of complications if the pregnancy is\nnon-molar.\n\n\nAmong women who have received chemotheraphy, there is no significant\ndifference in the outcome of their subsequent pregnancies when compared to\nthe general population ( 19-21).\n\n\nThe role of surgery in the treatment of choriocarcinoma H Z Song.\n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n\nSince the development of effective chemotherapy, the role of surgery\nin the treatment of choriocarcinoma has undergone a great change, evoking\nmuch controversy among different authorities.\n\n\nIn China, a similar change has happened.\n\n\nThe present paper is an overview of the change of the role of surgery\nin the treatment of choriocarcinoma for both primary tumour and metastatic\ndisease.\n\n\n ROLE OF SURGERY IN THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY UTERINE DISEASE \n\n\nBefore the availability of effective chemotherapy, hysterectomy\nfollowed by postoperative irradiation was the only treatment for\nchoriocarcinoma and the therapeutic result was very poor.\n\n\nAmong a group of 41 patients treated at the Peking Union Medical\nCollege Hospital, only four of six patients without apparent metastasis\nsurvived.\n\n\nAfter the advent of 6-mercaptopurine, surgery was then used in\ncombination with chemotherapy.\n\n\nAt the beginning, simple total or subtotal hysterectomy was employed.\n\n\nLater, it was found that in a number of patients, clumps of actively\ngrowing tumour cells or tumour emboli were found in the ovarian and\nparticularly the uterine veins, which often remained as a secondary source of\ndissemination after the removal of the primary uterine disease.\n\n\nThe operative procedure was extended to include the ovarian veins up\nto the Ievel of thc common iliac artery ( the most tortuous and engorged\nportion) and thc uterine veins medial to the internal iliac vein ( the\nusually thrombosed portion).\n\n\nAs the extended hysterectomy raised the complete remission rate from\n39.1% to 50% and lowered the recurrence rate from 8.0% to 3.3%, this type of\noperation was then used at one time as a routine procedure in our hospital (\n1).\n\n\nIn order to reduce the risk of dissemination of tumour cells during\nsurgical manipulation, chemotherapy was given 2-3 days before operation and\ncontinued postoperatively to complete a l0-day course.\n\n\nThe chemotherapy was repeated course by course till a complete\nremission was achieved.\n\n\nHowever, an extensive operation would inevitably form an additional\nburden to patients receiving intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n\n\nHence, following the successful trial of preservation of the\nfertility of young patients treated by chemotherapy alone, without removal of\nthe uterus2, the role of surgery in our hospital was changed again.\n\n\nChemotherapy alone became the method of first choice for all\npatients, including those who had already completed their families.\n\n\nThere was no significant increase in the number of courses of\nchemotherapy required to achieve complete remission ( 4.9 courses with\nhysterectomy vs 5.6 without).\n\n\nThe only disadvantage was that the lesions in the uterus might become\ndrug-resistant foci later on, if the chemotherapy was not properly given.\n\n\nHowcver, this disadvantage was compensated by benefits.\n\n\nThe method of treatment was simplified and the risk of operation was\neliminated.\n\n\nWith the advent of more effective chemotherapeutic agents,\n5-fluorouracil ( 5 FU) ( 28-30 mg kg-1 d-I dissolved in 500 ml 5% dextrose\ngiven by slow intravcnous infusion for 8h over an 8-10-day course when used\nsingly) and KSM ( an antibiotic similar but not identical to dactomycin and\nproduced in China, 8-lO ug kg-1d-1 dissolved in 500ml 5% dextrose given by\nintravenous infusion for 2-4h over an 8-10-day course when given singly),\nthc overall survival rate for choriocarcinon1a was raised to more than 80% 3\nand the rate of recurrence further reduced to 1.9%.\n\n\nMoreover, it was found that if there was any recurrence in patients\nwithout previous hysterectomy, the results of a further course of\nchemotherapy were much better than in those patients with the uterus removed,\nprobably because the vascular system of thc uterus was kept intact so that\nthe chemotherapeutic agent could still be delivered to thc site of disease as\nusual.\n\n\nHysterectomy is now performed in our hospital only under the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n\n( 1) Acute perforation of the uterus with severe intra-abdominal\nhaemorrhage endangering the life of the patient.\n\n\nIn this condition, emergency surgery is life-saving.\n\n\nIntrauterine haemorrhage, however, is usually not very severe and\nresponds to chemotherapy in a few days; it is not in itself an indication for\nhysterectomy.\n\n\n( 2) Persistent intramural lesion.\n\n\nMost of the primary uterine disease can be eradicated by chemotherapy\nalone, but at times the local lesion may become resistant to chemotherapeutic\nagents, particularly if the initial treatment was not properly done.\n\n\nUnder this condition, hysterectomy is indicated.\n\n\nIn young patients who are still desirous of childbirth, local\nexcision of the uterine tumours may be worthwl1ile, if the focal lesions are\nlimited in size and number as evidenced by ultrasonography or arteriography.\n\n\nFour of six patients so treated in our hospital had subsequent\nsuccessful pregnancies.\n\n\n( 3) Atypical choriocarcinoma.\n\n\nTo clear up the diagnosis, hysterectomy is usually helpful,\nparticularly in patients with placental site choriocarcinoma.\n\n\nIn patients who request hysterectomy because of age or fear of\nfurther pregnancy, hysterectomy may be performed but is better delayed until\nafter complete remission has been achieved.\n\n\nIn any condition, chemotherapy should also be given before, during\nand after operation.\n\n\nAs delayed healing and rupture of the incisional wound has occurred\nin several of our patients with severe anaemia, cachexia or chronic cough,\nretention sutures are advisable for these patients.\n\n\n ROLE OF SURGERY IN THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC LESIONS \n\n\nIn our patients with metastatic choriocarcinoma, surgery was mainly\nused in drug-resistant pulmonary metastases.\n\n\nFor metastases in other organs, surgery was done occasionally in\nselected patients.\n\n\n Pulmonary metastases \n\n\nMore than 90% of the patients with pulmonary metastases responded\nwell to chemotherapy.\n\n\nHowever, in some patients, particularly those who were improperly\ntreated, resistance to chemotherapy developed after an initial response.\n\n\nIn these cases surgery, if properly selected, was helpful.\n\n\nFrom 1965 to 1985, lung resection was performed in 50 patients with\nresidual foci of choriocarcinoma 4.\n\n\nIn summarizing the results, the survival rate was related to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n\n Gynaecological cancer \n\n\n( 1)The pulmonary metastatic lesions were confined to one lobe were\nwell-circumscribed as seen on the chest films, either initially or after\nchemotherapy, particularly when the lesion was solitary ( survival rate vs\n10% in cases with multiple-lobe involvement after chemotherapy). \n\n\n( 2) The titre of human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG) by\nradioimmunoassay after chemotherapy dropped down to a low (\n< 2000mlU/ml) and then remained stationar y ( 80% survival when hCG\n< 2000 mlU/ml vs 25% when hCG > 2000 mlU/ml).\n\n\n( 3) A change of the operative procedure to ligate the pulmonary\nfirst to prevent dissemination during operation ( 69% vs 45% i vein was\nligated first).\n\n\n( 4) On pathological examination of the resected lung specimens\nlesion or lesions were well-localized and surrounded by a lay fibrinous or\nfibrotic material ( 91.3% vs.\n\n\n33.3% when not well-localized).\n\n\n( 5) After operation, the hCG titre returned to normal within 10 (\n94% vs 0% if the titre rose rapidly).\n\n\nThe clinical staging of the disease on admission seemed to have\nbearing on the prognosis, provided that all the other metastases eradicated\nby chemotherapy before operation.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '765a3d31-1df4-49e4-8516-2a36654cf693', 'added':

{'text': 'NEW CORNERSTONE FOR SINGAPORE FOOD INDUSTRY- BIOTECHNOLOGY \n\n\nMong Hong WONG, MIES\n\n\nLam Soon Oil & Soap Mtg ( S) Pte Ltd\n\n\nSingapore\n\n\n ABSTRACT \n\n\nThis paper was prepared to identify the role of food biotechnology as\na new cornerstone for Singapore food industry.\n\n\nThe present status of Singapore food industry was first examined.\n\n\nFrom the relevant statistics, the importances and shortcomings of the\nindustry were revealed.\n\n\nThis was followed by a brief introduction of what food biotechnology\ncan offer.\n\n\nThe powertul and versatile conversion capability, the high\nselectivities and specificities, the production economy and limitations of\nfood biotechnology were highlighted.\n\n\nThe progress and plans of the development of biotechnology in some\nadvanced countries were next reviewed.\n\n\nThe paper concluded by proposing a few important measures that might\nserve as guidelines in preparing ourselves to meet this new challenge.\n\n\nThese measures included restructuring of the Industry, provision of\nappropriate government incentives, establishing a broad-based venture capital\nmarket, setting up a food biotechnology research and information centre as\nwell as provision of training, education and a set of relevant laws and\nregulations.\n\n\nEmphasis had also been placed on the issue of long term implications,\nrather than immediate impacts, of food biotechnology on the industry.\n\n\nTHE PRESENT STATUS OF FOOD INDUSTRY IN SINGAPORE Food and beverage\nindustry was probably one of the oldest members of the manufacturing sector\nin human history.\n\n\nIn Singapore, it could be traced back to the early establishment era.\n\n\nToday, food and beverage industry ranks at the fourth place according\nto the value of output in the Republic after machinery and appliances,\npetroleum and chemical products.\n\n\nThere are over 300 food production establishments which employ ten or\nmore persons operating in the Island.\n\n\nThe workforce engaged is more than 4% of the total employment of the\nmanufacturing sector ( see Table 1).\n\n\nThe training content in the labour force is generally low.\n\n\nSo far, about one for every ten food factory workers has received\nsome form of skilled training as compared to three for every ten workers on\nthe national average.\n\n\nThe productivity of this industry is also below the national average.\n\n\nThe value added for the food manufactured products in 1978 and 1988\nwere S&dollar;207 million and S&dollar;495 million respectively.\n\n\nThis represented a growth rate of 9.1%.\n\n\nThe value added per worker needs further improvements as well.\n\n\nNonetheless, the values of domestic export demonstrated remarkable\nexpansion.\n\n\nFor food alone, it grew from S&dollar;48.4 million in 1960, S&dollar;105.4 million\nin 1970, S&dollar;600.6 million in 1980 to S&dollar;904.7 million in 1988.\n\n\nThese data did not take beverage and animal/vegetable oils into\naccount ( see Table 2). \n\n\nTable 1  Principal Statistics of Food & Beverages Industry \nYear 1986 1987 1988 ( Provisional) Establishments

and\nbeverage industry contributes positively and significantly to our national\neconomy.\n\n\nHowever.\n\n\nthe present status of the food and beverage industry from the\ntechnology and modernisation viewpoint is far from satisfactory.\n\n\nMost of the establishments in this industry still remain at the low\nskill and labour intensive stage.\n\n\nThe progress on mechanisation and automation though forthcoming is at\na very slow pace.\n\n\nIn fact.\n\n\nmany are continuing to operate as small family business using\ntraditional arts and skills.\n\n\nQuality control, attractive packaging design, good manufacturing\npractices and other modern management practices and techniques seem to have\nbeen insulated from this sector apart from a handful of concerns.\n\n\nOn the whole, food and beverage industry in Singapore is due for\nup-grading and restructuring.\n\n\nThis is the time to introduce some structural changes and innovations\nto the industry so that it will survive through the even more competitive and\nchallenging environment of the 90\'s.\n\n\nIt needs some new cornerstones in the operation so that it can\nmaintain or even enhance its contributions to the nations.\n\n\nWHAT BIOTECHNOLOGY CAN OFFER?\n\n\nThe impacts of biotechnology on food production ( agriculture),\nprocessing and preservation are enormous and far reaching.\n\n\nBiotechnology is the practical application of biosciences.\n\n\nIt utilises bio-organisms, their sub cellular components, associated\nor derived enzyme system to perform some desired functions such as formation,\ntransformation or decomposition in manufacturing and service industries as\nwell as for environmental and energy management.\n\n\nAt least in principle, almost all organic materials can be converted\nby biotechnological techniques.\n\n\nAs such, the very first offer biotechnology can present is the\npowerful and versatile conversion capability which opens up the production of\nlimitless ranges of new products and new means of making or replacing the\nexisting products.\n\n\nThe production of \'many food flavours, stabilizers, emulsifiers,\ntexturing agents and colours are good examples.\n\n\nThey can be tailor-made according to the demand.\n\n\nThe production of monosodium glutamate ( MSG) revolutionises the\ntaste and palatability of almost all cookings.\n\n\nIn Table 3, a forecast has been made for the total market of\nbiotechnological oriented products by the year 2000 AD.\n\n\nIt will nearly be US&dollar;77 billions!\n\n\nAbout 40% ( ie US&dollar;30 billions) of this market is food-related.\n\n\nThe next offer biotechnology can make is its high selectivities and\nspecificities.\n\n\nThese characteristics have led to production of many valuable\nproducts which may or may not be possible to be made by the conventional\ntechnologies.\n\n\nBy employing the many useful tools developed in the fields of\ngenetics, molecular biology and fermentation, such as soma or gameto clonal\nvariations, tissue culturing, somatic cell hydridisation, protoplast fusion,\nseed or clonal propagation, enzyme applications etc, biotechnology can lead\nto manufacturing of products which possess the exact properties and\nspecifications as desired.\n\n\nA number of vegetable oils like low erucic acid rapeseed oil ( or\nCanola oil), low linolenic acid soyabean oil, low wax sunflowerseed oil,\ngossipol-free cottonseed oil etc fall into this category.\n\n\nHigh yielding rice and wheat varieties, high amylase or protein\nmaizes are further examples.\n\n\nThe extensive usages of Aspartame as a low-calorie sweetener\nespecially in the \'diet\' soft drink industry further strengthen this feature\nof biotechnology in food industry.\n\n\nBiotechnology normally works on relatively inexpensive and abundantly\navailable raw materials.\n\n\nThis virtue renders it readily to be adopted and economically to be\nput into practices.\n\n\nIt offers good human quality and nutritious food which can be sold at\nconsistently low price.\n\n\nLong time ago, Indonesians had developed a process to introduce\nfungal mycelium into soyabean cotyledons to convert the latter into tempe\nkedele.\n\n\nThis product has been used as low cost protein rich food.\n\n\nToday, we have little difficulties to find this meat analogue in many\nparts of U.S.A.\n\n\nand U.K..\n\n\nModern researches have also aggressively performed the growth of\nvarious kinds of edible mushrooms on straws, wood shavings, waste paper and\ncottons with remarkably short growing time.\n\n\nBiotechnology can help to work on alternative raw materials as well.\n\n\nThis flexibility resolves many supply problems arising from seasonal\npattern, price fluctuation and transportation.\n\n\nFor instance, high fructose syrup originally from corn starch is also\nproduced by sago or tapioca starches in the tropical countries where corns\nare not readily available.\n\n\nFructoses which is 30% sweeter than sugar are commonly found in\nbeverages, frozen confectionery and bread nowadays. \n\n\nTable 3  Growth Potential for Biotechnological by the year 2000\nAD   Market Sector  Estimated Value ( US&dollar;

Bulletin Nov 1983. \n\n\nBiotechnology can offer competitiveness to production costs\nfavourably.\n\n\nOnce the strains had been identified and improved, mutation can be\napplied to increase the production of lipases.\n\n\nAs a result, they can overproduce even scarce natural product and\nenhance the productivity of the process.\n\n\nThe biotechnological reactions usually run at or near ambient\ntemperature.\n\n\nThere is no necessity for expensive repeated heating and cooling.\n\n\nBiotechnology also avoids extreme conditions in terms of acid,\nvacuum, pressure etc.\n\n\nTremendous savings can be achieved from energy conservation and\nhardware fabrication.\n\n\nBiotechnology can further affect production costs in a positive\nmanner by reducing the land or space requirements, increasing the product\nresistances and tolerances, improving product yields, eliminating some\nprocess steps hence some expenses and losses.\n\n\nAll of these contribute to making cheaper finished products.\n\n\nHowever, the applications of biotechnology are not without\nlimitations.\n\n\nA major deterrent to the employment of biotechnological processes\ncurrently may be the cost of enzymes.\n\n\nAfter the development of immobilised enzyme technology, the expansive\nenzyme can be recovered after it has performed its task and be reused again.\n\n\nIn this way, the amount of material processed per unit mass of enzyme\ncan be greatly increased.\n\n\nBiotechnology is restricted by many practical considerations,\nenvironmental factors, current state-of-art in technology, as well as health\nand safety regulations.\n\n\nBiotechnological processes are extremely sensitive to contaminations\nespecially those of microbial nature.\n\n\nStrict sterilisation must be carried out thoroughly for fermenters,\nvessels, pipelines, fittings and other plants equipment.\n\n\nEnvironmental and atmospheric cleanliness must strictly be ensured\nand controlled.\n\n\nDue to the specific nature, scaleup is always a tedious and\ncontroversial process.\n\n\nOperating conditions of biotechnological reactions must be exactly\ndetermined and accurately implemented so that repetitive results can be\nachieved consistently.\n\n\nThe downstream processes such as separation and purification can be\ncostly to operate as well.\n\n\nEven after the finished products have been produced, it is costly and\ntime consuming to obtain " fit for human consumption" approval or \'gras\' (\ngenerally regard as safe) status.\n\n\nStrict regulations, operating procedure and precautions must also be\ndocumented to ensure the safety of handling personnel, consuming public and\nthe environment.\n\n\nThat is why, for the time being, biotechnology seems to be\nsuccessfully applied only to high value added products.\n\n\n WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING? \n\n\nCurrently, the world development of biotechnology is led by the\nUnited States.\n\n\nIn America, the federal agencies play the role of providing adequate\nmanpower training, up-to-date infrastructure, conducive environment and\nregulatory control for the progress in biotechnology.\n\n\nThe actual industrial and commercial activities are carried out by\nthe private corporations.\n\n\nA large number of large and small private enterprises have been\nestablished during the last few years to commercialise the know-how derived\nfrom the research and development in the biotechnological field.\n\n\nIn Japan, a biotechnological office had been set up by MITI to\npromote and co-ordinate biotechnological works in general.\n\n\nSpecial attention has been given to those research work which cannot\nbe accommodate under existing facilities and infrastructure.\n\n\nIn particular, a systematic programme has been adopted for the\ndevelopment of enzyme technology.\n\n\nThe pace of progress of biotechnology in the EEC countries is not as\nswift as their counterparts in USA and Japan.\n\n\nNonetheless, the French Government has set up an agency known as \'Codis\'\nto look after the growth of biotechnology.\n\n\nThe West Germany Government plays an active role in the funding and\nplanning of biotechnological research in universities, research centres and\nindustries.\n\n\nThe Chemical Economic Development Committee of UK emphasises the\nneed for more biotechnological research efforts on selective basis to be\nconducted in the manufacturing sector.\n\n\nIn Canada, Allelix Inc intends to spend US&dollar;100 million over the next\n10 years to focus on commercialisation of their biotechnological based\nproducts and processes.\n\n\nCSIRO, Australia, on the other hand, has given the highest priority\nfor the continued development of genetic engineering techniques and the\ncontinued research with recombinated DNA strains.\n\n\nShe has also established an industrial microbiology unit for\ninnovative research.\n\n\nAlthough the above progress is more for biotechnology in general,\nthe same trend can be said for the food development.\n\n\nIn short, practically all the governments and private sectors of the\ndeveloped countries have endorsed the powerful and promising role of\nbiotechnology in the coming technological era and launched the basis and\ninfrastructure to cultivate and built it up into a new cornerstone for the\nfood and process industries.\n\n\n WHAT SHOULD WE DO? \n\n\nIf we would like to maintain our existence in the food field in the\n90\'s and beyond and if we would like to enhance our contributions to the\nSingapore economic development, we cannot ignore or overlook the effects of\nthis new cornerstone, food biotechnology.\n\n\nWe must keep up with the world in developing it, at company,\nindustry as well as national levels.\n\n\nThe following are some of the measures we may be able to take up in\norder to achieve the goal.\n\n\n( a) To pull all resources, facilities, talent and financial\nstrength in the food and beverage industry together to face the challenge.\n\n\nThis is easy in saying then doing.\n\n\nIt is not easy to convince the competing food operators to cooperate\nand to give up their traditional practices. \n\n\nNonetheless, we must endeavour to achieve a critical mass in order\nto receive this new technology either through joint venture of technology\ntransfer.\n\n\nWe must invite some multinational and specialised companies related\nto food biotechnology to join our industry and to invest in our development.\n\n\n( b) To provide good financial, tax and other incentives by\ngovernment, at least at this initial stage.\n\n\nWe expect food biotechnological projects will only yield long term\nbenefits.\n\n\nSome unusually attractive incentives such as 15-20 years period tax\nholidays, total tax exemption on capital gain, generous incentives for\nunlisted securities market, ready provisions for tax offsetting on losses etc\nmust be offered.\n\n\nIncentives for biotechnological projects must be focussed on both\nreturns and losses.\n\n\nIncentives must not only be limited to the production of the\nfinished products, but also be extended to the concept, the methodology, the\nassay, the design, the process, the biomedia and the intermediates.\n\n\nResearch grants must be readily available for the encouraged areas\nand areas of general applicability such as screening, culture collection and\nidentification, separation, purification and some common expensive equipment\nand facilities.\n\n\nGrants should also be made available for all activities that\ninitiate and promote food biotechnology.\n\n\n( c) To make available venture capital and long term high risk\nfinancial funding.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, food biotechnological projects are high-risk\nby nature.\n\n\nThe traditional financiers may not understand and appreciate this\nnature and prepare to accept the consequences.\n\n\nAs such, there is a strong need to have a broad-based venture\ncapital market here.\n\n\nFood biotechnological ventures tend to offer future promises with\nlittle immediate returns.\n\n\n( d) To set up food biotechnology pilot plant and information\ncentre.\n\n\nIt is an important step to establish a centralised food biocentre\nto provide relevant data base, up-to-date information and adequate facilities\nto carry out bench scale research, pilot plant trials, optimisation and scale\nup studies, modelling and simulations etc.\n\n\nWe must prepare an organised and systematic programme for the\napplied R&D work on selective basis.\n\n\nA priority list must be drawn out according to our needs and\ncapability.\n\n\nThis is to prevent any disconnected, duplicated and redundant\nefforts which may lead to wastages and delay.\n\n\nA good starting point may be to look at regionally available\nmaterials or locally demanded products.\n\n\nSome forms of linkages must be established between this centre and\nher counterpart in the developed countries such as NSF ( USA), BRI ( Canada),\nTNO ( Holland), INRA ( France), NPC ( New Zealand), CSIRO ( Australia).\n\n\nIf possible, these linkages must be extended to the Universities\nand some private laboratories as well.\n\n\n( e) To provide training and education.\n\n\nThese are at least three set of training and educational programme\nto be set up.\n\n\nThe first group of people needed to be kept abreast with the latest\ndevelopment of food biotechnology are the decision makers of both public and\nprivate sectors including financial institutions.\n\n\nUnlike other high-tech industries, such as electronic and computer,\nfood biotechnological research is mostly presented in the form of ideas and\ntechniques.\n\n\nMore often than not, there may be no proto-type manufacturing or\nproduct until the very later stage of the project.\n\n\nThe next group of people we would like to train are the\nbiotechnologists.\n\n\nThese include professionals, specialists and technicians of many\ndisciplines.\n\n\nThe tertiary academic institutions like the Universities and\nPolytechnics, including the food biocentre mentioned above, will inevitably\nplay an active role for such education.\n\n\nOf course, we must supplement the formal training with close\ninteraction with the industry and extensive exchanges with the oversea\ncounterparts.\n\n\nLast but not least, we should not overlook the importance of common\nawareness among the general public and consumers on food biotechnology.\n\n\nIf we can bring home the message that food biotechnology will\ninevitably become part and parcel of our lives for well being in not too\ndistant future, we shall not only lessen their psychological fears on the\nsubject, but also increase their level of willingness and confidence to\naccept food biotechnological products.\n\n\nGiving due recognition of food biotechnology in the primary and\nsecondary school curricula with some general publicities via public media,\ncampaigns, exhibitions, seminars etc should assist us to achieve the\nnecessary awareness.\n\n\n( f) To establish a set of laws and regulations: There are at least\ntwo aspects of the laws and regulations we have to consider.\n\n\nFirstly, for human and environment safety.\n\n\nAlthough bioorganisms cultured and/or modified in biotechnological\nworks are unlikely to possess sufficiently strong surviving capability\noutside the controlled environment, we cannot afford to take this assumption\nin total confidence.\n\n\nWe must have a set of appropriate laws and regulations which\ndetails the guidelines of handling bioorganisms, bioproducts and\napparatus/equipment used in the biosystems.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the laws that we need to review is the\nproprietary rights on intellectural properties such as patent protections,\ncopyrights, etc.\n\n\nIf we wish to encourage our researchers and entrepreneurs to\nventure into new and unexplored areas, easy and fast access to patent\nprotection including inexpensive legal expenses, simple application\nprocedures etc are the essential incentives.\n\n\nFor food biotechnology, we should give weights to the patent rights\nof ideas, concepts, bioorganisms, methodology, assays, techniques etc as well\nas to that of the products, design, equipment and processes.\n\n\nSome forms of regional and international co-operation in the\nenforcement of these laws must also be looked into.\n\n\n CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\n\nFrom the current status of development, we do not expect food\nbiotechnology to cause drastic changes of our industrial base in the nearby\nterms.\n\n\nWe are still at the germinating stage.\n\n\nThere are many legal, financial, technical and technological\nobstacles to be removed.\n\n\nThere are also many human and environment problems to be resolved.\n\n\nBut this does not mean we can overlook or hold the \'wait and see\'\nattitude for this trend.\n\n\nWith the present sophistication on information and\ntelecommunication, we can anticipate the cycle time of any industrial\nrevolution will be shortened.\n\n\nWe must assess carefully the long terms impact and implications of\nfood biotechnology as a new cornerstone to the food development of mankind in\ngeneral and Singapore food industry in particular.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'f3b9e1de-ce3b-446f-9c8f-173fce943b81', 'added':

{'text': 'Product Data Exchange Trends and Evolution \n\n\nJenny Ang,\n\n\n Introduction \n\n\nA CIM system typically consists of a series of functional areas such\nas design, process planning, manufacturing, testing, inspection etc.\n\n\nThe computer aided tools in each module are different in nature and\nare difficult to integrate with each other.\n\n\nTo develop an efficient and robust CIM system, an effective\ninformation link must be established between each module so as to provide\ndata exchange and information sharing.\n\n\nHistory of PDES After the first release of IGES Initial Graphics\nExchange Specification) in 1980, numerous attempts at providing flexible, yet\nstable method of CAD data transfer have resulted in a number of\nspecifications.\n\n\nSome of these have become national standards.\n\n\nIGES as an initial graphics specification has suffered from some of\nthe drawbacks such as file size too large, poor design format, limited scope\nfor expansion etc.\n\n\nNevertheless, IGES is a widely accepted standard and is supported by\nmost of the CAD vendors and has established itself as the international de\nfacto standard during the past ten years.\n\n\nSome other standards that were derived from IGES, but have been\nmodified to overcome some of it\'s shortcomings and to accommodate particular\napplication areas, such as VDA-FS for the car manufacturing industry in\nGermany and SET for the aerospace industry in Europe, are also widely\nadopted.\n\n\nThe existence of too many standards resulted in a call for a unified\napproach capable of accommodating all types of product information.\n\n\nA few main efforts were initiated almost simultaneously, namely the\nProduct Data Exchange Specification ( POES) by US National Bureau of\nStandards, which has changed it\'s name to National Institute of Science and\nTechnology ( NIST); the CAD interface project ( CAD*I) in Europe; the Product\nDefinition Data Interface ( PDDI) by the US Air Force and the Standard for\nthe Exchange of Product Data ( STEP) by the International Standard\nOrganisation ( ISO).\n\n\nIn late 1988, the ISO committee responsible for the STEP agreed to\nadopt the first version of PDES as a draft of STEP, resulting in a single,\ninternational standard - PDES/SEP.In late 1989, the committee responsible had\nagreed to change the acronym for PDES: PDES no longer stands for " Product\nData Exchange Specification" but rather stands for " Product Data Exchange\nus;ng STEP".\n\n\n What is PDES \n\n\nPDES can be viewed from several different viewpoints and is actually\na compilation of many different activities.\n\n\nPDES is a standards development process.\n\n\nPDES is also a combination of different technologies.\n\n\nPDES is also an activity contributed by several different people from\nmany companies and organisations ( 1).\n\n\nThe change of the PDES acronym has made PDES more of an activity\nrather than a US-specified standard.\n\n\nAs a enterprise product standard, PDES has as its objective the\nability to define all the information needed throughout the life cycle of a\nproduct, such as to exchange geometry data between different CAD/CAM systems,\nto provide translation of information from CAD systems down to other\nfunctional areas such as process planning, manufacturing, testing etc.\n\n\nThe fundamental mission of PDES is to provide a specification that is\nable to integrate information from all different CIM modules, so as to\ndevelop a fully automated CIM system.\n\n\n Introduction to IGES \n\n\nIGES is the current de facto international standard for product data\nexchange and is partially supported by many CAD systems.\n\n\nSince the release in 1980 of the first version of IGES, the PDES/STEP\nOrganisation has added increasingly sophisticated data construct to the IGES\nspecification.\n\n\nAs the capabilities of IGES have been expanded to accommodate more\napplications, the specification has become more pliable.\n\n\nSome of these change have added to the complexity and ambiguity of\nthe specification, and this has increased the difficulty of using IGES\neffectively.\n\n\nSince IGES is a widely supported standard format for CAD graphics and\ntext information, most vendors of CAD systems supply pre and post-processors\nto translate their native system files into and out of IGES, respectively.\n\n\nThe IGES pre-processor will translate CAD data from the system native\ndata-base into the IGES neutral file format and vice versa for the IGES\npostprocessor.\n\n\nDuring the translation, some errors may occur, party due to the IGES\nprocessors supported by the CAD vendors and party due to the poor design\nformat of IGES.\n\n\nSince the first release in 1980, the IGES committee had added\ncomplicated entity constructs into IGES so as to accommodate more application\nareas.\n\n\nThere is a long list of entities available for the CAD vendors to\nchoose from.\n\n\nNo CAD vendors will support the entire IGES specification.\n\n\nAs a result, each CAD vendor will implement a different subset of\nspecification, and this have increased the difficulty in the entity mapping\nduring the translation.\n\n\n IGES File Structure \n\n\nIGES divides its physical file into five sections; namely, the START\nsection, the GLOBAL section, the DIECTORY ENTRY section, the PARAMETER DATA\nsection and the TERMINATE section.\n\n\nThe START Section contains user readable information.\n\n\nThe GLOBAL section contains information describing sending system and\ndata required by the receiving system etc.\n\n\nDIRECTORY ENTRY and PARAMETER DATA section will handle entity\ninformation and the TERMINATE section records the number of cards of each\nsection.\n\n\nFrom the file structure described above, we can see that, for each\nentity to be contained in the IGES file, at least three cards are needed.\n\n\nTwo in the Directory section and one in the Parameter section, and\nthis will take up at least 240 bytes.\n\n\nAs a result, the entire file size can be as large as ten times the\ndrawing file it translated.\n\n\nAnother drawback for entity stored in this way is that, for any\nprogram to read or write to the IGES file it must look for the information\nabout each entity in two places.\n\n\n IGES Drawbacks \n\n\nAs we have mentioned, every CAD vendors support different subsets of\nentity and represent their system data using different IGES entities.\n\n\nAs a result, the same information may be data encoded in different\nways.\n\n\nThe net result is, information is lost during the translation between\ndissimilar entity sets.\n\n\nIn addition to the existing pre- and post-processor, there must\ntherefore have another program that has the ability to recognize the data\nencoded in both the CAD systems.\n\n\nThis program is known as the flavouring program.\n\n\nThe main purpose of the flavouring program is to maintain the data\nintegrity translated between different CAD systems.\n\n\nThe problem is, we can have as many flavouring program as the number\nof CAD systems that are exchanging data.\n\n\nThe fundamental idea of introducing neutral file formats is to\neliminate the number of translators required in a CAD systems exchange\nnetwork.\n\n\nUsing direct translation method, for N CAD systems exchange network,\nwe require N*(N-1) translators, whereas for neutral file method the number of\ntranslator required is only 2N.\n\n\nThe requirement of flavouring has reintroduced the problems of\ndeveloping additional N*(N-l) flavouring program.\n\n\nAlthough some of the errors can be overcome by the flavouring\nprograms, there are always errors that cannot be solved, there are always\nentities that you can express in one format but which has no representation\nin another format.\n\n\nWhen translating such data across the CAD systems, one can only try\nto maintain its visuality but not the functionality.\n\n\nAll this sum up the major drawback of-IGES, it is designed to carry\ngeometry data but not product information.\n\n\nSame data may represent different information, although in the\nconverse, the same information may be data encoded differently, but that\ndoesn\'t matter.\n\n\nSo, if we have a specification that is capable of carrying the\nproduct information rather than just the geometry data, most of the problems\nencounted above can be solved.\n\n\nThe ideal product data exchange standard must not only describe\ngeometry data but also information such as product material, product\nfeatures, tolerances, configuration management and other information that are\nrequired for producing this product in a CIM environment.\n\n\nWith all this in mind, and to overcome the error associated with\nIGES, in 1984, the IGES committee set up a research project called PDES with\na long-range objective of developing and using a rigorous methodology for the\ncreation of product exchange specification.\n\n\nThe methodology was to be used in developing a new product exchange\nstandard that would avoid the identified weaknesses of IGES [ 3] - - and this\nnewly introduced standard is known as PDES.\n\n\nThe Product Data Exchange Specification ( PDES) is a data description\nand format standard under development for the exchange and sharing all data\nneeded to fully describe a product and its manufacturing processes.\n\n\n[ 1] The difficulties associated with the transfer of data rather\nthan information between each CIM module are that the meaning of data might\nbe misunderstood by other functional modules and human interpretation is\nneeded at every stage to help in editing of data.\n\n\nPDES has eliminated this problem by first defining all information to\nbe carried in each application area.\n\n\n The Three Layer Architecture of PDES \n\n\nPDES adopts a three layer schema architecture which is similar to the\ndatabase structure.\n\n\nThe external , or the very top layer of the structure is known as the\napplication layer, which define - the information that is expected to be\nencountered in each application area and model by using the PDES specified\nmodeling language EXPRESS .\n\n\nThe fundamental idea of PDES is that there is a common set of data\nthat describes all kinds of products, and this product definition is\nindependent of specific computer environment and implementation.\n\n\nThee common set of product definition data model, such as geometry,\ntopology, tolerances, form feature, layered electrical product, finite\nelement modeling, material, presentation etc.\n\n\nform the second layer of PDES.\n\n\nThis middle layer, or in PDES term, the logical layer is the focus\npoint for integrating all information model defined in the top layer.\n\n\nThe bottom layer, or the internal layer is the physical layer.\n\n\nThe physical layer has the PDES data represented in the Physical file\nformat, or in a database format.\n\n\nThis layer also defines a set of rules for the mapping of the logical\nlayer product definition data model into the physical file format.\n\n\nThe separation of PDES standard is very important as it allows the\nuser to concentrate on the information, or the " meaning" of their data\nwithout worrying the physical representation of the data in the neutral file.\n\n\nImplementation Level of PDES For any standard to be practical, it\nmust be implementable.\n\n\nFor PDES, there are four different levels of implementation.\n\n\nThe top two levels are for exchange of product data and the lower two\nlevels are for product information sharing.\n\n\nThe first level of implementation is the passive file exchange.\n\n\nThis layer is similar to - IGES, which defines the conversion of CAD\nsystem\'s native database into the PDES neutral physical file and vice versa.\n\n\nThe second level is known as the active file exchange.\n\n\nThis is characterized by the concept of a working form of data which\nis used by access software to translate to and from a neutral sequential file\nformat and to provide DBMS-like data structure navigational capabilities.\n\n\nThe third implementation level of PDES is the shared database layer.\n\n\nThis level has a logical description of all the product data and a\nphysical implementation of this information in a database format.\n\n\nApplication can then reach into that database and pull out the\ninformation they need to drive their specific application [ 1].\n\n\nLevel 4 is the Integrated Product knowledge base.\n\n\nA knowledge base implementation of PDES is represented by using an\nobject oriented approach to the storage of product definition data where the\nproduct data and methods to operate on that product data are stored together\nas an object in an object-oriented database.[l] The first attempt to draft\nthe PDES application protocols is being made by PDES Inc.\n\n\nprogram and U.S.\n\n\nNavy\'s RAMP project.\n\n\nPDES Inc.\n\n\nProgram The PDES Inc.\n\n\nprogram is an industry funded cooperative project to accelerate the\ndevelopment and implementation of PDES within industry.\n\n\nThe program is using a combination of industry provided personnel\nknowledgeable in PDES technologies and hired contractors working together\nfocusing on the development of the PDES specification. \n\n\n[ 1] The PDES Inc.\n\n\nprogram has divided their program into two phases and each phase\nlast for 18 months.\n\n\nThe objective of phase 1 is to develop a Level 1 and Level 2\nimplementation of PDES and phase 2i to develop a Level 3 implementation of\nPDES.\n\n\nThe program was officially started in late 1988, and by now, it\nshould have completed its first phase of program.\n\n\nRAMP Project The Rapid Acquisition of Manufacturing Parts ( RAMP)\nproject is designed to accelerate the acquisition process for critical spare\nparts.\n\n\nIt is the U.S.\n\n\nNaval

{'text': "UNDESIRABLE PERORMANCE OF CONCRETE STRUCTURES \n\n\nDr Leong Tuck Wah\n\n\nSchool of Building & Estate Management\n\n\nNational University of Singapore\n\n\nSingapore 0511\n\n\nKeywords: structures, concrete, performance, strength, serviceability,\ndurability, defects, maintenance\n\n\n Abstract \n\n\nThe unsatisfactory performance of reinforced and prestressed concrete\nstructures is emphasized in this article.\n\n\nThe causes and symptoms of defects in buildings in association with\nthese undesirable performance are identified and appropriated remedial action\nare prescribed to allow or to prevent the occurrence of such defects.\n\n\n Introduction \n\n\nStructure is the part of a building responsible for the bearing and\ntransmission of loads.\n\n\nIt is generally analogous to the skeleton which carries a human body.\n\n\nConsidering the numbers of buildings which had been successfully\ndesigned, constructed and remained functionable until to-date, there were\nrelatively few known cases of failures.\n\n\nIndeed, any failure, particularly accompanied with losses of lives\nand properties, frequently caused intensive public outcry irrespective of\nwhether it was an act of nature or due to human negligence.\n\n\nAlthough structural concrete is a relatively durable form of\nconstruction, the material in its constituent forms ie concrete and steel,\nare, by all means, not entirely maintenance free.\n\n\nComparing to steel structures, there have been relatively more cases\nof unsatisfactory performance of concrete structures during and after the\ncompletions of the construction works.\n\n\nIn some newly completed structures, strengthening and stiffening\nworks are required to eliminate defects caused by errors of design and\nconstructions.\n\n\nWhilst in some other cases, major and minor repairing works have to\nbe undertaken to counteract the effects of normal deterioration.\n\n\nIt is also not uncommon that specialised techniques of strengthening,\nstiffening and repair are used to restore damages produced by unforeseeable\nevents, such as those caused by accidents, eg fires, floods, impact and earth\nmovements.\n\n\nThe diagnosis and prescription of corrective works for a concrete\nstructure requires that its defects and unsatisfactory performance to be\ndetected early so that such work can be well planned and designed.\n\n\nIt would be better if such undesirable qualities of the structure can\nbe foreseen and predicted even before the construction.\n\n\nNevertheless, the knowledge gained from the pathology of failures and\nfrom those unsatisfactory performance of concrete structures will serve as\nfeedback and lessons for all personnel working in the building industry.\n\n\nIt is ultimately expected that with such feedback and hard earned\nlessons, disasters of the same natures will not be repeated in the future.\n\n\nTypes and causes of unsatisfactory performance of concrete structures\nBasically a well planned, design and constructed structure shall be capable\nto carry loads without causing excessive deformations, deflections whilst\nmaintaining its overall stability over a certain defined time period.\n\n\nIn addition, it must also be capable to maintain, throughout its\ndefined period of service, a track record of durability so that the\narchitectural appearance and functions shall not be adversely affected.\n\n\nFrom these above requirements the undesirable performance of concrete\nstructures can be classified according to the respective causes, ie\n\n\n( 1) Inadequate load carrying capacity,\n\n\n( 2) Unreliable serviceability and\n\n\n( 3) Reduction in durability.\n\n\nHowever, the various exhibited symptoms of defects, generally need\nfurther specific classifications.\n\n\nOn the building structures, it is only the exhibited symptoms of\ndefects which provide the clues for the diagnosis.\n\n\nthe various defects commonly occur in concrete structures (\nreinforced and prestressed) are listed as follows:\n\n\n( 1) Cracks in concrete\n\n\n( 2) Spalling of concrete\n\n\n( 3) Swelling and discolouration ( 4) Erosion of concrete surface\n\n\n( 5) Corrosion of steel\n\n\n( 6) Yielding and snapping of steel\n\n\n( 7) Excessive deflection of members\n\n\n( 8) Debonding between concrete and steel\n\n\nSometimes the defects shown on a structure may not be due to just one\ncause.\n\n\nInstead, it can be the result of a combination of causes.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it is also possible that a similar symptom of\ndefect eg cracking can be the only exhibited clue shown in one or all the\nthree categories of undesirable performance of several reinforced or\nprestressed concrete structures.\n\n\nBecause of the above complexities, it makes the diagnosis and\nretrospective analysis ( or the pathology) of the unsatisfactory performance\nof concrete structures more difficult.\n\n\nUndesirable Performance Due to Inadequate Load Carrying Capacities of\nStructures Design and detailing errors including,\n\n\n( 1) the under estimations of loads\n\n\n( 2) the over estimation in strengths and stiffness\n\n\n( 3) the use of inaccurate or inappropriate methods of structural\nanalyses and designs\n\n\n( 4) the incorrect transmission of information to the drawings\nerroneous detailings can result in inadequate load carrying capacities of the\nstructures.\n\n\nSimilar situations can also arise when,\n\n\n( 6) there are abused usages of the buildings and structures (\nincluding cases of overloading during constructions)\n\n\n( 7) the structures are being subjected to unexpected loads, or\n\n\n( 8) there are unexpected circumstances where a severe loss occur in\nthe structural strength.\n\n\nAn under-designed or overloaded concrete structure will continue to\ncarry load until collapse in approximately the following orders:\n\n\n( a) redistribution of loads ( three dimensional) over its entire\nstructure whilst showing off distressing symptoms of inadequacies\n\n\n( b) changes in structural actions eg from beam action to catenary\naction or arch action ( depending on the designing details and the\ndevelopments of defects)\n\n\n( c) severe yielding of steel or spalling of concrete occur leading\nto the formations of plastic hinges ( d) a mechanism is developed which can\ncause imminent collapse.\n\n\nIt is important to note that before its collapse the resistance of\nthe structure must gain equilibrium with the effects of the imposed loads.\n\n\nIf the increase in loads has exceeded the strength of the structure,\nit will be a miracle that it is not going to collapse.\n\n\nIt is well known to engineers that the strength of concrete has been\nfrequently referred to that at its age of 28 days ( ie the graded strength).\n\n\nHence under normal time gain and through further hydration, the long\nterm strength of concrete shall be higher than such graded strength.\n\n\nWhilst such concept is true for concrete cured under control\nenvironment, such gain in strength is unreliable in the case of structural\nconcrete.\n\n\nUnder sustained dead and imposed loads, creep of concrete causes an\napproximately similar ( if not more) margin of reduction to the long term\nstrength for structural concrete.\n\n\nEvidence of such reductions can be seen in reference ( 1).\n\n\nAlthough there had been many cases of total collapses in concrete\nstructures there were even more cases where the collapses involved only a\nrelatively large area or volume of the respective building ie a wide spread\ncollapse.\n\n\nMore often, such wide spread collapses were tickled off by local\nfailures from an under-designed or severely defected key member.\n\n\nIt is also possible that the sudden loss of one key structural member\ncan, in turn, cause a chain reaction or a house of cards or domino collapse\nof a large portion of a structure.\n\n\nSuch collapse usually follows the successive losses of all load\nbearing members along a certain load path as well as members adjacent to such\nareas.\n\n\nUnder such circumstances, the collapse of one floor comes immediately\nafter another.\n\n\nThis type of failure is known as progressive collapse.\n\n\nCases of total collapses, wide spread collapse, local collapse and\nprogressive collapse can be seen in reference ( 2,3,4).\n\n\nUnreliable Serviceability Excessive cracking, spalling and\ndeflections or buckling which adversely affect the appearance or efficiency\nof structures are generally regarded as undesirable qualities.\n\n\nIn a concrete building these qualities do not confine within the\nconstruction period and the period immediately after completion of the\nconstruction works.\n\n\nThe short term ( elastic) deformations or deflections usually proceed\nonto the time-dependent phase of developments.\n\n\nDeformations can be caused by compressive or tensile loads or by\nchanges in the environment ( ie temperature and shrinkage).\n\n\nIf the deformations occurring in the critical sections of a member\nare approximately uniform, there is not much deflection.\n\n\nInstead, if the corresponding stresses built up in the section have\nexceeded the compressive strength of concrete ( after load redistributions)\nthe concrete starts to spall.\n\n\nIf, however, there is great differential deformations ( in particular\nof different sign notations) and occurring over the total depths of the\nmember sections, deflections cause unwanted cracking in concrete.\n\n\nThus in structural mechanics, deformations and spalling or\ndeformations, deflections and cracking are generally considered as phenomena\nof consequential orders.\n\n\nConcrete cracks when the stresses it carries or in transmission have\nexceeded its tensile strength.\n\n\nThe following can be the contributory causes toward tensile cracking\nin a concrete structures:\n\n\n( 1) differential foundation settlement\n\n\n( 2) lateral ground movement and heaving\n\n\n( 3) severe changes in temperature and shrinkage\n\n\n( 4) overloading and underdesign of the structure\n\n\n( 5) errors in construction and poor workmanship ( while casting\nconcrete)\n\n\n( 6) Erroneous designing-details\n\n\n( 7) abused usage or change in use of the building\n\n\n( 8) unexpected loading\n\n\n( 9) insufficient provision or omission of control joints\n\n\n( 10) aging and deterioration in concrete causing reduction in its\nstrength.\n\n\nDeformations resulting in the spalling of concrete ( particularly\nthose occurring) in columns or load bearing walls shall be investigated with\nutmost care.\n\n\nSuch symptoms of defects are similar to those undesirable structural\nperformance due to severe overloading conditions.\n\n\nDeflections and cracks are generally unavoidable in concrete\nstructures.\n\n\nHowever, these defects normally occur in one or more critical section\nin the structure or structural members.\n\n\nAlthough as a whole, cracking normally does not result in structural\nfailures, undoubtedly, it can cause a definite loss of performance.\n\n\nA redistribution of the loading can occur in a structure due to the\nreduction in stiffness in the partially cracked members.\n\n\nSevere redistribution of loads can in turn cause overloading together\nwith reductions in the factors of safety in basically underloaded members.\n\n\nCracking also accelerates deterioration from moisture penetration\nthereby rendering a building structure unserviceable for its original purpose\nand consequently reducing its service life.\n\n\nExcessive deflections or bucklings are usually the main concern on\nthe instability of a building structure.\n\n\nLocal instability can result in global instability and failure\ncan-occur.\n\n\nExamples of such failure ( or close to failure) can be seen in\nreferences 2 and 3.\n\n\n Reduction in Durability \n\n\nThere are many circumstances whereby a concrete structure gradually\nloses its required strength, impermeability and other similar types of\nimportant properties.\n\n\nThese result in reductions of the structures' service lives.\n\n\nThe main reasons can be,\n\n\n( 1) inappropriate concrete mixes used in the construction\n\n\n( 2) poor workmanship\n\n\n( 3) concrete cast from contaminated constituent materials (\nincluding contaminated water and inappropriate types of admixtures)\n<&dollar;> ( 4) weathering and aging\n\n\n\n( 5) carbonations and corrosions\n\n\n\n( 6) aggressions by chemical or/and biological agents\n\n\n\n( 7) abrasion and surface erosion\n\n\n\n( 8) lack of considerations in drainage, wearing surface and\nstructural-cladding interaction etc.\n\n\n\nThe symptoms of defects exhibited on the concrete structures are\nviz., swelling, discolourations, cracking, spalling in the concrete, rusts in\nthe steel bars and disintegration between concrete and steel.\n\n\n\nDurability problem does not surface immediately after the\ncompletions of the construction works.\n\n\n\nIt appears gradually over a certain time period.\n\n\n\nIts rate of development depends primarily on:\n\n\n\n( 1) the original strength, porosity and related properties\n\n\n\n( 2) the chance of concrete exposes to certain environmental\ninfluence ( such as water or pollutants) or comes in contact with some\nchemical or biological agents or being subjected to natural or physical wear\nand tear actions.\n\n\n\nInadequate provisions of drainage gradients, wearing surfaces or\nthe inappropriate choices on architectural and M and E cladding, fitting,\nfixing materials ( with incompatible properties) only accelerate the early\ndeterioration and decaying processes.\n\n\n\nIn a majority of cases chemical or biological aggressions commence\nfrom the surfaces of the concrete structures.\n\n\n\nThese can be identified early by experienced investigators or\nmaintenance personnel.\n\n\n\nSamples of defected concrete in the damaged areas can be collected\nand forwarded for tests in order to gain confirmations of such chemical\nor/and biological attacks.\n\n\n\nThe worst cases consist of concrete cast with contaminated\naggregates or chemical salts ( in particular, alkali reactive aggregates).\n\n\n\nThe latent defects may not show off until the disintegrations in\nconcrete have reached the surfaces of the structures.\n\n\n\nBy then, large areas of the concrete structures could have already\nbeen affected.\n\n\n\nSince the disintegration of concrete occurs within the concrete\nand much depending on the chances in which the chemical salts turn into\nsolutions and in turn react with the concrete, such damages formed at early\nstages may not be easily detected. \n\n\n\nThis type of undesirable behaviour of concrete is, to a large\nextent, analogous to the development of cancer in human being.\n\n\n\nThus it is popularity known as concrete cancer.\n\n\n\nIf concrete cancer is discovered in a rather late stage the cost\nefficiency of repair and replacement of large area and volume of concrete may\nmade in uneconomical compare to demolishing the structure and rebuild.\n\n\n\n Remedial Actions \n\n\n\nPrevention is always better than cure.\n\n\n\nThe effective means of prevention is to be able to foresee or\npredict the occurrence of such undesirable performance of the structure.\n\n\n\nDesign errors and detailing errors may be able to be eliminated\nor minimized by the accredited checker's scheme implement by the Building\nControl Division since 1st of May 1989.\n\n\n\nAs to the maintenance of concrete buildings for the long term\nserviceability and durability it must emphasize herewith that preventive\nmaintenance cannot wait to commence work until cases of unsatisfactory\nperformance of a structure occur.\n\n\n\nRather, such a scheme shall be incorporated at a stage as early\nas possible, preferable at the planning and design stages of the project.\n\n\n\nThe proper choices of materials together with the implementation\nof an efficient system of quality control and assurance throughout the\nconstruction period may help to reduce future maintenance work to a minimum.\n\n\n\nHowever, no material is inert to physical wear and tear whilst\nimmune to deterioration and chemical attacks.\n\n\n\nPeriodical inspections and repairs on defected parts of\nstructures are still required for its constant restoration.\n\n\n\nThese will ensure the continuous serviceability and durability of\nsuch structure throughout its designed life span.\n\n\n\nA maintenance scheme emphasizing such an Integrated approach for\nthe maintenance of concrete structure can be seen in ( 5).\n\n\n\n Conclusions \n\n\n\nUndesirable performance of concrete structures can occur if the\nstructures have processed inadequate load carrying capacities, unreliable\nserviceability and reduction in durabilities.\n\n\n\nDesign and detailing errors, erroneous constructions, abused\nusages or change in usages, unexpected loading conditions, aging and\nweathering decays of the materials, chemical and biological aggressions, the\nlack of considerations of the compatibilities of combining architectural, M\nand E and structural materials as well as the act of nature can each or all\ncontribute one way or the other towards such unwelcome results.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1f31f663-0bae-4d3b-bda8-1e5f1908b329', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.728684+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9423827528953552,

{'text': 'Manufacturing Document Management System \n\n\nV Narayanan\n\n\nInformation Technology Institute\n\n\nNational Computer Board\n\n\n71 Science Park Drive, Singapore 0511\n\n\n Introduction \n\n\nIn the past, much attention has been paid to factory and process\nautomation to improve the productivity of the blue collar workers.\n\n\nIt is essential at this moment, to focus our attention on the\ninformation-intensive manufacturing office activities.\n\n\nThough investments in word processing software have improved the\nefficiency of white collar workers, they have also accelerated the paper\ncreation trend.\n\n\nNearly 95% of manufacturing engineers use paper, pencil, copiers,\nscissors, etc.\n\n\nto create and revise their documents.\n\n\nThe communication channel between departments are often clogged with\nprocess sheets, tool lists, drawings and gaging and machining\ninstructions[l].\n\n\nCreating, revising, and improving manufacturing documents are costly\nand time consuming.\n\n\nIn addition, lost and misfiled documents are very common.\n\n\nThe mundane task of storing documents has become problematical and\nspace is at a premium.\n\n\nSo, there is a need to develop shop documentation programs to solve\nthe above problem.\n\n\nIt will save 50% of the time to create and 90% of the time to revise\nthe manufacturing documents [ l].\n\n\nIt will also bring down the cost of document storage and retrieval to\n25%.\n\n\nThe integration of the enterprise-wise documentation, will help in\nachieving the concept of Computer Integrated Manufacturing ( CIM).\n\n\nKuniko Inoue, in her article in Look Japan[2], brought out the need\nfor managing information from market surveys, production processes and\ndelivery.\n\n\nShe adds, " It is imperative that the connection between sales and\nmanufacturing activities are consolidated.\n\n\nA major issue is how to accumulate and maintain a production\nknowledge system".\n\n\nA network-based Manufacturing Document Management System ( MDMS) is\nthus proposed for the manufacturing sector.\n\n\nThis system will integrate functions such as design, production,\nsales and procurement.\n\n\nFor example, today individual engineers generate drawings on CAD, but\ncirculate them by hand/mail.\n\n\nThis process can be made more efficient using MDMS.\n\n\nCIM can be defined as a system to integrate manufacturing\ntechnologies by means of Information Technology ( IT).\n\n\nSo, CIM will be the plant\'s communication capacity.\n\n\nThis product is designed with this philosophy to strive for a CIM\nenvironment.\n\n\n 2 What is EDM? \n\n\nElectronic Document Management ( EDM) is a giant step in the\nautomation of information processing.\n\n\nEDM can be defined as, " The application of information technology to\nmanage the flow of paper-based information.\n\n\nEDM provides facilities for storing, accessing and retrieving\ndocuments in the electronic form." It is a synergy of a number of information\ntechnologies such as, Document Image Processing ( DIP), workflow, data\nprocessing, office automation, document understanding and intelligent\nretrieval.\n\n\nThe key is DIP, the technology to convert the paper-based\ninformation into the electronic counterpart.\n\n\nThe result is an environment whereby information from a variety of\nsources is completely automated and integrated.\n\n\nTo address the diversified of requirements, the EDM system spans a\nwide variety of sizes, complexity and cost ranging from standalone PCs to\nlarge ( mini or main frame based) systems [ 3,4].\n\n\nManufacturing Document Management System Computer-Aided Acquisition\nand Logistics Support ( CALS), a major US Department of Defence and Industry\nprogramme is attempting to automate and manage the large volume of technical\ninformation required to support a weapon system throughout its life cycle.\n\n\nThe standards being developed for CALS are based on existing and\nemerging national and international standards for interchange of text and\ngraphics, and for database definition and access [ 5].\n\n\nThe CALS initiative will provide a good frame work for the proposed\nMDMS.\n\n\nManufacturing document Management system ( MDMS) will be an EDM,\ntailored to meet the needs of the manufacturing sector.\n\n\nThe proposed architecture is presented in figure 1.\n\n\nThe system captures different information types ( data, text, image,\ngraphic, video and voice) and distributes to the users.\n\n\nThere will be a provision to modify/edit the document before the\ndistribution.\n\n\nFigure 2 is a typical MDMS, running on LANs or WANs.\n\n\nNetworking strategy will allow for the easy and staged incorporation\nof this advanced technology into an existing base of information systems.\n\n\nIt will be an open environment where industrial standards and non\nproprietary technologies are utilised.\n\n\nUNIX will be the primary operating system, with the support for DOS\nand MS-Windows.\n\n\nMDMS will be designed to manage multimedia information which\nincludes, text, drawings, images and spread sheets.\n\n\nMDMS will provide a unified environment for the management and\nrouting of these diverse forms of information.\n\n\nIn addition, the system will support existing software such as\ngraphic and text editors to process graphics and text.\n\n\n 3.1 Distributed System \n\n\nOne of the most significant trends in computing today is the move\ntowards distributed processing via what is known as the client-server model.\n\n\nThis architecture is proposed for MDMS, as presently most of the\nfactories have standalone PCs or workstations.\n\n\nThese individual resources could be linked up using LAN for\ncommunication and sharing of resources.\n\n\nClient-server computing will extend the value of distributed\nprocessing to the desktop by splitting an application into a front-end client\napplication that resides on the end user\'s workstation and a \'back-end\'\nserver component that runs on computing resources anywhere in the corporate\nnetwork.\n\n\nThe client presents and manipulates data while server stores,\nretrieves and protects data.\n\n\nSo in future, networked PCs accessing powerful server based\napplications in a distributed processing environment will allow the user to\ngain access to databases, mails, communication and document management\nservices from the desktop.\n\n\nThe emergence of fax and ISDN will enhance the acceptance of MDMS.\n\n\n3.2 Creation Scanning ( or digitizing) the information, in the form\nof photographs, drawings and pictures, using optical scanners is the first\nstep to create the electronic documents from paper documents.\n\n\nAvailable products with bi-level digitization capabilities at\nresolutions of 200-400 dots per inch and speeds of 3-10 pages per minute,\nwill be sufficient for this application.\n\n\nThe system will be able to scan different types and varying sizes of\ndocuments.\n\n\nIt will have facilities for creating new forms like, a work-order\nform, a process routing form, a fixture form, and a quality inspection form.\n\n\nIt can be interfaced with other systems such as bills of materials\nsystems, popular word-processing, text editing, desktop-publishing, and\ngraphics CAD/CAM/CAE software packages.\n\n\nIt will be integrated with the terminal products, and other systems\ncontaining the source information.\n\n\n3.3 Image Processing An image editor, developed at Information\nTechnology Institute ( ITI) for Document Image Processing can be adapted for\nMDMS [ 6].\n\n\nAn A4 sheet scanned at 300 dots per inch(dpi) black and white\nrequires 1.2 MBytes for storage.\n\n\nSo the images captured have to be converted or compressed to another\nform for efficient storage.\n\n\nThe two methods for conversion are, 1.\n\n\nConvert raster to ASCII by Optical Character Readers ( OCR).\n\n\nThis is a very efficient method as an ASCII file consumes only about\n3 to 5% of the disk space used by an image.\n\n\nWith omnifont OCR systems, a vast majority of typed information on\nseveral fonts can be converted.\n\n\nHowever, error rates are still high and they are useful for\nconversion only to a limited extent.\n\n\n2.\n\n\nVectorisation: Vector data treats an image as a series of points and\ngeometric figures such as lines, circles or arcs.\n\n\nThis process of converting raster data into vector data is suitable\nfor images containing line drawings, flow diagrams and circuit diagrams.\n\n\nMost of the documents that are not suitable for conversion by the\nabove methods are compressed as per a two dimensional coding scheme,\ncomplying with international standards like CCITT G4 for interchangeability.\n\n\nThe document file format used in the image editor was Tag Image File\nFormat ( l l), which is a de facto standard.\n\n\nThis is useful when transmitting the images through fax gateways.\n\n\nEditing functions provided include cut, paste, copy, move, crop,\ndelete, scale and rotate ( refer figure 3).\n\n\n 3.4 Database \n\n\nThe electronic documents can be efficiently indexed and retrieved by\nrelational DBMS\'s and SQL queries.\n\n\nNetwork-based client-server DBMSs will be sufficient for this.\n\n\nThe manufacturing documents can be identified with a part or drawing\nnumber as the main index or combined with other indices like work order\nnumber.\n\n\nIt will also allow remote users to copy a document or make changes\nwithout corrupting the originals.\n\n\n3.5 Storage The multimedia information will be stored in optical\ndisks on juke boxes.\n\n\nA single 12 inches optical disk can store as much as 50000 A4 images\nusing suitable compression algorithms.\n\n\nA juke box uses robotic technology for mounting and dismounting\noptical disks allowing quick online access to several million images.\n\n\n3.6 User Interface User interface will consist of icons and pull down\nmenus.\n\n\nIt will use windows as a consistent interface across desktop\ntechnologies, applications, and operating environments.\n\n\nThe documents will be displayed using relatively inexpensive high\nresolution monitors ( 1000 x 1000 pixels).\n\n\nThe output can also be printed using the laser printer or fax.\n\n\n3.7 Workflow Workflow is an important unifying factor for the\nenterprise-wise imaging and will allow for more accurate decision making.\n\n\nIt will automate the flow of documents according to a predesigned\nroute for action, approval and review.\n\n\nThis opens doors for parallel processing of documents.\n\n\nIt is also expected to provide an environment to integrate all the\nfunctions such as creation, revision, review, approval, control, archiving,\ntracing and displaying documents[7].\n\n\n Fi 3 Image Editor developed by mf6l \n\n\nA prototype has been built for a workflow mailing or mail sequencing\nsystem [ 8].\n\n\nThe initiator creates a workflow mail, specifies the sequence and\npasses it to the first person in the sequence.\n\n\nThe initiator can add his comments in the attachment.\n\n\nThe attachment is used for appending annotations made by each person\nin the sequence.\n\n\nA provision is available for any person in the sequence to query the\ninitiator or people who have already processed the workflow mail.\n\n\nQuery messages and clarifications are also treated as annotations.\n\n\nWhen a mail moves from one person to another, a status mail is\ngenerated and sent to the initiator.\n\n\nProcessing workflow mail involves adding annotation and pass it to\nthe next person ( see figure 4).\n\n\nWorkflow system for MDMS can be developed based on this concept.\n\n\nThe workflow architecture of MDMS, will facilitate the engineering\nchange release procedure for engineering documents including drawings within\na distributed manufacturing environment.\n\n\n 3.8 Intelligent Documentation \n\n\nThe system can be enhanced to automatically identify the input\ndocument format of scanned images for classification and indexing purposes.\n\n\nIt will have limited capabilities to understand image contents (\nreferred as image understanding) as human operators do, in order to direct\narchival, retrieval and workflow activities within a business.\n\n\nIt will be able to search for documents even with incomplete or\nerroneous information.\n\n\n3.9 Networking More companies are moving towards globalizing their\nbusinesses and there is a major shift towards decentralized production.\n\n\nThis creates a need for the various manufacturing units of an\nenterprise to access information and exchange documents among themselves.\n\n\nThere will be a need even for cooperative processing in the near\nfuture.\n\n\nThe MDMS architecture has been designed to address the need for\nmulti-enterprise networking.\n\n\n4 Document Standard Document standards are required for document\nexchange among a variety of systems.\n\n\nThe most significant international standards are the Office Document\nArchitecture ( ODA-ISO 8613) and the standard Generalized Markup Language (\nSGML - IS 8879).\n\n\n Process Workflow \n\n\nOriginator: SHAN\n\n\nWorkflow sequence: HARIN SHAN NARA ROLAND\n\n\nSubject: Demo

{'text': 'INTEGRATING CAD and MRP Il SYSTEMS \n\n\nChua Tay Jin, Assoc Prof Ho Nai Choon, Dr Yeo Khim Teck,\n\n\nGINTIC Institute of CIM,\n\n\nNanyang Technological Institute\n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n\nOver the years, technologies have been developed to increase\nproductivity of the various manufacturing functions.\n\n\nThese independent efforts have resulted in the various \'islands of\nautomation\' such as: computer Aided Design ( CAD), Computer Aided\nManufacturing tCAM), Flexible Manufacturing Systems ( FMS), Manufacturing\nResource Planning ( MRP 11), Group Technology ( GT), Automated Materials\nHandling ( AMH), Computer Aided Process Planning ( CAPP), Artificial\nIntelligence ( Al), and others.\n\n\nWhen properly planned, managed, and implemented, most of these systems\nwill prove beneficial to their specific areas of application.\n\n\nBut too often, manufacturers plunge into one or more of these\ntechnologies without clear goals or long term plans.\n\n\nThis fragmented approach may produce incremental improvement to the\nmanufacturing efficiency.\n\n\nHowever, the lack of a coordinated long term plan may result in\ntremendous difficulty in integrating these various islands together.\n\n\nComputer Integrated Manufacturing ( CIM) conceives manufacturing as a\nseries of integrated processes and provides a strategic framework for linking\nthese independent activities and information flow.\n\n\nThe goal of CIM is to achieve overall improvement in productivity of\nthe total manufacturing enterprise through integrating all its processes into\na coherent system.\n\n\nA modular approach has to be adopted to ensure the success of CIM\nimplementation due to the complexity in both the technical and organizational\naspects.\n\n\nAn initial nucleus which allows gradual expansion by permitting\ninteraction between it and other system\'s databases has to be identified.\n\n\nManufacturing Resource Planning ( MRP 11), which supports operation\nplanning and execution, is best positioned to play this pivotal role.\n\n\nAn ideal candidate for integration with MRP 11 is Computer Aided\nDesign ( CAD) system.\n\n\nThe basis of integration is Part Master Record ( PMR) and Bills of\nmaterial ( BOM) information, which is essential to both systems.\n\n\nThis article outlines the common elements in CAD and MRP 11 systems,\ndiscusses the benefits of sharing information in both systems, and the\nrequirements for integration.\n\n\nThis article also discusses the roles of CAD and MRP 11 systems in a\nCIM framework, and suggests a method of integration through the use of a\ngeneric interface that can easily hook onto any CAD or MRP II systems.\n\n\nFinally the implementation of the methodology using Micro MAX MRP II\nsystem and Micro CADAM CAD package is presented.\n\n\n A PROPOSED CIM ARCHITECTURE \n\n\nFigure 1 shows a proposed model of CIM architecture.\n\n\nIt consists of four basic components: Computer aided design ( CAD),\nComputer Aided Process Planning ( CAPP), Computer Aided Manufacturing ( CAM)\nand Manufacturing Resource Planning ( MRP 11)12.\n\n\nCAD establishes the part descriptions in a database accessible to\nother manufacturing functions, it serves as the design center of the whole\nsystem; CAPP translates design data information into manufacturing data in\nthe form of process plan which includes selection of the appropriate\nmanufacturing process, sequencing of production operations, specifying and\nacquiring tooling, detailing speeds and feeds, and estimating set-up and run\ntimes.\n\n\nCAM converts the product data into physical parts by producing\nspecific instructions for individual machines and controlling the machine\noperations.\n\n\nMRP 11 is playing the role of coordinating and monitoring all the\nmajor functional areas of a manufacturing business, which is the natural \'hub\'\nof the CIM system.\n\n\n APPLICATION SYSTEMS - MR Il and CAD \n\n\nMRP II is a closed-loop material and production planning and control\nsystem.\n\n\nlt includes not only material planning concepts but production\nresource planning and feedback loops that report actual results against the\nplan.\n\n\nMRP II provides a mechanism for checking the material plan against\nmanufacturing resources and for identifying problem areas as the plan is\nexecuted [ 7].\n\n\nFigure 2 shows the relationship between the planning and control\nelements within MRP 11.\n\n\nAs illustrated, the shop floor control, purchasing and accounting\nmodules feed back actual results into the planning modules so that corrective\naction can be taken as needed.\n\n\nMRP II is an integrated system by itself, consisting of several\nfunctional modules built upon a common database, and can serve as an\nimportant information center of CIM .\n\n\nThe top management creates the strategic/business plan, which sets\nthe overall business objectives, including the goals for revenues.\n\n\nThe marketing/sales plan generates the independent demand in the form\nof customer orders and/or sales forecasts.\n\n\nThe production plan provides key communication links from top\nmanagement to manufacturing.\n\n\nIt determines the basis for focusing the detailed production\nresources to achieve the strategic objectives of the firm.\n\n\nThe production plan might be in dollars or aggregate units of output\nper month.\n\n\nThe master production schedule ( MPS) projects the end-item\nproduction requirements by time period ( normally a week) and specific end\nitem part numbers based on the production plan, sales forecast, customer\norders, and planned changes in the inventory levels of finished goods.\n\n\nMaster production schedule is a basic input to and driving force\nbehind the material requirements planning module.\n\n\nMRP is considered as the key component of MRP 11, it translates gross\nrequirements for end items into time phased net requirements for\nsubassemblies and individual parts based on the MPS, product bills of\nmaterial, and current inventory status.\n\n\nGross requirements are obtained by " exploding the end item product\nstructure into its lower level requirements.\n\n\nThe exploding process is simply a multiplication of the number of end\nitems by the quantity of each component required to produce a single end\nitem.\n\n\nThe explosion identifies what components are required, as well as how\nmany, to produce a given quantity of end items.\n\n\nBy referring to the inventory status in the inventory control module,\nthe gross quantities will be netted by subtracting the available inventory\nitems.\n\n\nThe actual order quantity for an item may be adjusted to a suitable\nlot size, or it may simply be the net requirement.\n\n\nJust as important as " what" and " how many" is when.\n\n\nMRP schedules time-phased orders by lead time offsetting.\n\n\nFor purchased components, the lead time is the time interval between\nthe placement of the purchase order and its availability in inventory.\n\n\nFor manufactured components, it is the interval between the release\nof the work order and its completion.\n\n\nThe outputs of an MRP run are a series of purchase and manufacturing\norders, which then are handled and monitored separately by the purchasing and\nshop floor control modules respectively.\n\n\nBefore the issue of manufacturing orders to the shop floor control\nmodule, the capacity requirement planning module is executed first to\ndetermine if MPS is feasible based on available manufacturing capacity.\n\n\nCapacity planning determines how many persons, machines, and physical\nresources are required to accomplish the tasks of production based on the\nfuture manufactured-component requirements from MRP and released, in-process\nmanufacturing order information to develop a profile of production resource\nusage.\n\n\nReports are produced showing projected production work center load\nversus capacity.\n\n\nThe shop floor control module develops a production schedule for\nmanufacturing orders by using routing information.\n\n\nIt also controls manufacturing orders release to the shop floor and\ntracks production order status through work centers.\n\n\nThe purchasing orders are firmed, released, and tracked by purchasing\nmodule which also provides vendor performance information.\n\n\nThe accounting module supports accounts receivable, accounts payable,\ngeneral ledger, personnel and payroll, and other accounting functions.\n\n\nUsing inventory information and product cost data, the value of the\ncurrent inventory can be determined.\n\n\nUsing cost data, product structure, and routing information, the\nmanufactured cost of any item can be calculated.\n\n\nAccounts payable is also coordinated with purchasing and receiving\nand payroll is used to record labor costs with data from shop floor control.\n\n\nBecause of its integrated architecture and provision of a modular\ncapability for integration, MRP Il is best positioned to serve a vital link\nbetween design and manufacturing within a Computer integrated manufacturing (\nCIM) framework [ 5],[6],[7].\n\n\nComputer aided design ( CAD) is the use of computers in interactive\nengineering drawing and storage of designs.\n\n\nUnder operator direction via various interaction device and\nprogramming techniques, the computer can complete a part\'s layout, geometric\ntransformations, projections, rotations, magnifications, and cross-section\nviews [ 31].\n\n\nCAD assists the designer in conceptualising and detailing a part\ndesign.\n\n\nThe role of CAD in CIM is to serve as the center for design\ninformation for the entire organisation.\n\n\nIt translates design ideas into product data from which manufacturing\ninformation can be generated.\n\n\nCAD data can be divided into two categories: part\nspecification/product structure data and geometric/design data.\n\n\nThe part specification/product structure data represent much of the\nsame information maintained in the Bill of materials module of MRP 11,\nwhereas the geometric/design data is to be interfaced with computer aided\nprocess planning ( CAPP) system.\n\n\nFUNDAMENTAL SIMILAITIES OF CD AND MRP 11 SYSTEMS The common data\nelements shared by CAD and MRP 11 systems are maintained in the Part Master\nRecord ( PMR) and Bill of Materials ( BOM).\n\n\nIn a MRP 11 system, PMR is the collection of basic information that\nidentifies and registers a part into the system\'s database.\n\n\nIt contains information needed for all the related modules in the MRP\n1I system, which include purchasing, inventory control, material requirements\nplanning etc., such as:\n\n\nPart identifier,\n\n\nPart description,\n\n\nItem number,\n\n\nProcess control code ( or part type code, make/buy code),\n\n\nUnit of measure, - Drawing number, - Revision level,\n\n\n- Engineering Change Notice ( ECN) number,\n\n\n- Effectivity start/end dates,\n\n\n- Supersedes part number,\n\n\n- Superseded by part number,\n\n\n- Standard cost.\n\n\nMost of the PMR information are also maintained in the CAD system for\nthe purposes of documentation and classification of the design drawings.\n\n\nA bill of materials ( BOM) is a list of the items, ingredients, or\nmaterials needed to produce a parent item, end item, or product.\n\n\nIt can take several different forms and be used in many ways.\n\n\nIt may be a simple parts list, or structured to indicate how a\nproduct is produced.\n\n\nThe BOM is called a product structure when it indicates how a product\nwill be produced, it contains information on all materials, components, or\nsub assemblies required to produce each end item ( or master scheduled item [\n5].\n\n\nIn the MRP II system, while the master production schedule plans how\nmuch of each item must be available on particular dates to satisfy\nindependent demand, the product structure records are used to derive the\nquantities of dependent components required to build the end items.\n\n\nMoreover, the bill of materials is not just a simple listing of\ndependent demand items, but a structured list which describes the sequence of\nsteps in manufacturing the product.\n\n\nThe product structure record contains the materials for the end item\nin levels representing the way they are actually placed in the manufacturing\nprocess.\n\n\nEach level in the structure represents a distinct stage of the\noverall manufacturing process: from the conversion of raw materials into\nsubassemblies at the lowest level, to the subsequent steps involved in\nbuilding assemblies, and lastly to the final assembly of the end item at the\nhighest level in the structure [ 5].\n\n\nA typical product structure record may consist of the following data\nholds:\n\n\n- Parent part identifier,\n\n\n- Component part identifier,\n\n\n- Effectivity date,\n\n\n- Quantity per assembly,\n\n\n- Leadtime offset,\n\n\n- Engineering Change Notice ( ECN) number,\n\n\n- Alternate part identifier.\n\n\nThe product structure information of a part is defined by the CAD\nsystem as the part is created.\n\n\nIt can only be extracted if the designer follows the methodology\nrecommended by the data extraction program.\n\n\n BENEFITS OF CAD-MRP II INTEGRATION \n\n\nSubstantial benefits can be realized by accessing MRP 11 system data\nduring the process of product design using a CAD system.\n\n\nIn fact, several advantages can be obtained even without any formal\nlink between the two systems.\n\n\nInformation such as inventory and work-in-process levels, incoming\npurchase orders, and cost data will facilitate the design process by helping\nthe engineer in making a better decision.\n\n\nAccess to MRP 11 data will also promote better communication between\nengineering and manufacturing department by making engineers more cost\nconscious.\n\n\nFor example, during the design change process, the engineer would be\nable to access inventory, cost and pending order information about a\ncomponent before determining the change\'s effectivity date. \n\n\nEven greater benefits can be obtained when CAD and MRP 11 systems\nare integrated \' 1.\n\n\nWhen a part is released from a CAD system, the PMR and BOM\ninformation will have to be manually entered into the MRP II system, along\nwith the required additional information ( eg Iead times, order policy,\nmin/max order quantity etc.).\n\n\nThis manual transcription of data from CAD to MRP 11 is redundant\nand time consuming, and up to 75% of the errors in product design can be\nattributed to errors in such transmission [ 4].\n\n\nThe problem will be aggravated in keeping track of the inevitable\nengineering changes throughout a product\'s life cycle.\n\n\nTranscription errors will likely be increased at each step, due to\nthe need to enter and maintain data in each system independently.', 'subdomain':

{'text': "USE OF FERROCEMENT IN COMPOSITE CONSTRUCTION \n\n\nInternational Conference on Steel and Aluminium Structure\n\n\nICSAS 91, Singapore, 22-2 May 1991\n\n\nK H Tan K C G Ong\n\n\n Introduction \n\n\nFerrocement is a form of reinforced concrete using closely spaced\nmultiple layers of mesh and/or small-diameter rods completely infiltrated\nwith, or encapsulated, in mortar ( 1).\n\n\nIt has a high tensile strength to weight ratio and possesses improved\ncracking characteristics over ordinary reinforced concrete.\n\n\nMoreover, it offers advantages in terms of fabrication as it can be\ncast thin and to almost any shape.\n\n\nFerrocement has therefore found many applications in housing units,\nwater-tanks, roofing elements and others [ 2, 3, 4].\n\n\nThe use of ferrocement in composite construction, however, has not\nbeen explored.\n\n\nIn this study, the behaviour of ferrocement-steel ( FS) and\nferrocement-ferrocement ( FF) composite beams under bending is investigated.\n\n\nEight composite beams were prepared and were each simply supported\nsubjected to a symmetrical two-point load.\n\n\nThe test results are reported and discussed herein.\n\n\n TEST PROGRAMME \n\n\nTest specimen\n\n\nThe eight test specimens were equally divided into two series, A an\nB.\n\n\nSeries A specimens ( A1 to A4) were half-scale models of the\nprototype composite construction ln buildings [ 5] while series B specimens (\nB1 to B4) were one-third scale models of a footway bridge [ 6], as shown in\nF1.\n\n\nThey were designed to have ultimate moments of resistance of\napproximately 168 kNm and 600 kNm respectively under positive bending ( that\nis, with the slab component ln compression).\n\n\nAll series A specimens composed of a ferrocement slab connected to an\nI-shaped beam by through bolts.\n\n\nThe ferrocement slab measured 35 c in thickness and 500 mm in width.\n\n\nThe reinforcement for the slab consisted of layers of skeletal steel\nhaving a grid size of 100mm, 5.4 mm and an average yield stress of 560 MPa\nand 3 layers of fine wiremesh with a grid size of 12.5 mm, wire diameter of\n1.22 mm and average yield stress of 360 MPa.\n\n\nThese reinforcements were placed centrally with respect to the\nmid-depth of the slab.\n\n\nFor specimens A1 and A2, the beam component was a 178 mm x 102 mm x\n21.54 kg/m Grade 43 steel joist.\n\n\nFor A3 and A4, it was a ferrocement section [ Fig.\n\n\n2(a)] reinforced with 4 layers ( 2 on each face) of the first\nwiremesh described earlier, and nine longitudinal steel bars with diameter of\n12 mm and average yield stress of 480 MPa.\n\n\nShear connectors ( 16 mm diameter Grade 8.8 high strength steel\nbolts) were provided in two rows at 100 mm spacing in A1 and A2 and at 150 mm\nspacing in A3 and A4 effect the horizontal shear transfer between the slab\nand beam components.\n\n\nSeries B specimens composed of a 20 mm thick ferrocement connected to\na U-shaped beam.\n\n\nThe slab was 700 mm wide and reinforced with 1 layer of the skeletal\nsteel and 2 layers of the fine wiremesh.\n\n\nFor specimens B1 a and B2, the beam was fabricated from Grade 43\nsteel plates while for B3 and B4 it was a ferrcocement section reinforced\nwith 2 layers ( 1 on each face) of fine wiremesh, supported by flatten\nlongitudinal steel bars with a diameter of 16 mm and average yield stress of\n530 MPa [ Fig.\n\n\n2(b)].\n\n\nThe shear connectors were provided in fours at a spacing of 50 mm for\nB1 and B2 a and in twos at a spacing of 130 mm for B3 and B4.\n\n\nFor all specimens, the mortar mix for the ferrocement components had\na cement:sand:water ratio of 1:1.5:0.4.\n\n\nA mixtures were added according to the manufacturers' recommendations\nso as to improve the workability and to achieve early high strength.\n\n\nPreparation of test specimens The slab and beam components were cast\nseparately.\n\n\nFor the ferrocement slabs, the positions of the shear connectors were\nfirst marked on wooden mould.\n\n\nRecesses 16 mm in diameter and 5 mm deep were then drilled into the\nmould at these positions.\n\n\nThe steel reinforcement was placed in the mould.\n\n\nSteel rods 16 mm in diameter were then hammered vertically into the\nrecesses and where they were obstructed, the wiremesh were cut away.\n\n\nThe rods were subsequently wrapped around with cloth tapes to\nincrease their diameters above the face of the mould to 18 mm.\n\n\nMortar was then placed into the mould on a vibrating table which\nensured proper compaction of the mix.\n\n\nThe casting of ferrocement beam components proceeded in three stages.\n\n\nFor the I-beam, the base flange was cat first.\n\n\nThis was followed by the casting of the top flange and finally of the\nweb.\n\n\nFor the U-beam, the base flange was cast first, the webs next and\nfinally the top flanges.\n\n\nHoles of 18 mm diameter were provided in the top flange of the beam\ncomponents in the same manner as for the slab components.\n\n\nThe steel rods were removed about four hours after casting, when\nmortar began to set.\n\n\nThe ferrocement components were cured under wet hessian for one day\nand then air cured ln the laboratory for another three to four days before\ndemoulding.\n\n\nThe components were connected by passing bolts through the holes in\nthe slab and flanges of the beam components.\n\n\nThe composite beams thus prepared were subjected to tests about one\nweek after casting.\n\n\nTest set-up and instrumentation Prior to casting, electrical\nresistance strain gauges were mounted on to the skeletal steel in the slab\ncomponents at the midspan section.\n\n\nStrain gauges were also mounted on the surface of the composite beams\nacross the depth as well as across the width at the midspan section and at\nthe section adjacent to the loading point within the flexural zone.\n\n\nEach beam was simply supported over a span of 2.7 m and subjected to\na symmetrical two-point load as shown in Fig.\n\n\n3.\n\n\nThe beams were tested in positive bending ( that is, slab component\nin compression) for specimens Al, A3, Bl and B3 and in negative bending (\nthat is, slab component in tension) for the other specimens.\n\n\nA linear variable displacement transducer ( LDVT) was placed below\nthe test specimen at the midspan to monitor the maximum deflection.\n\n\nAdditional transducers were placed at the two ends of the specimen to\nmeasure the relative slip, if any, at the interface between the slab and beam\ncomponents.\n\n\nAll the specimens were tested to failure except B2 for which the\nsupports yielded prior to attainment of ultimate load.\n\n\n TEST RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n\n Load-deflection characteristics \n\n\nThe load vs.\n\n\nmidspan deflection curves for Series A and Series B specimens are\nshown ln Fig.\n\n\n4(a) and ( b) respectively.\n\n\nIt is seen that for FS beams ( that is, specimens Al, A2, Bl and B2),\nthe load-deflection curves generally consist of three regimes: a regime with\na linear load-deflection relation up to the yield load, a translation regime\nwhere yielding of steel proceeds towards the neutral axis of the critical (\nmidspan ) section and a regime where full plastic deformation occurs at the\nsection of failure.\n\n\nOn the other hand, FF beams ( A3, A4, B3 and B4) exhibited linear\nload-deflection relation up to the cracking load.\n\n\nA transition period follows during which cracks continue to develop\nand the stiffness of the beam decreases.\n\n\nAnother linear relation is seen after the cracks have stabilized.\n\n\nThe stiffness of the composite beam decreases near the ultimate load.\n\n\n Cracking load and crack pattern \n\n\nFor FS specimens under positive bending, that is, A1 and B1, the\nfirst cracks were observed in the flexural span of the slab component at\nabout 30% to 40% of the ultimate load ( see Table 1).\n\n\nSeveral longitudinal cracks appeared on the top face of the slab\ncomponent above the edges of the top flanges of the beam component and these\nwere probably due to the effects of transverse moments.\n\n\nDue to stress concentration, random cracks were also observed to\ninitiate from the holes which accommodated the shear connectors.\n\n\nThe FS specimens ( A2 and B2), when subjected to negative bending\nregistered cracking loads of about 10 to 20% of the ultimate loads.\n\n\nThe cracks were found to concentrate within and near the flexural\nspan of the specimens.\n\n\nThese cracks traversed through the depth of the slab components as\nthe load is increased.\n\n\nstabilized.\n\n\nThe stiffness of the composite beam decreases near ultimate load.\n\n\nSpecimens A3 and B3 ( F7 8peclolens) had lower cracking loads\ncompared to the equivalent FS specimens under positive bending.\n\n\nThe is obvious as cracks initiated in the beam components and only\nappeared in the slab components at a later stage.\n\n\nOn the beam components, the crack first appeared as a flexural crack\nfrom the lower flange near the middle of the shear span.\n\n\nAs the load was increased, more cracks appeared and these propagated\ninto the webs, inclining generally at approximately 45 to the longitudinal\naxis.\n\n\nCracks were also observed in the flexural span, but these did not\npropagate very far towards the slab components.\n\n\nFor specimen B3, spalling was observed along the locations of\nskeletal steel at the web near the ultimate load.\n\n\nThe slab components for both specimens were relatively uncracked,\nexcept for some inclined cracks within the shear spans and a few random ones\nat the top face due to transverse moments and stress concentration at the\nholes.\n\n\nFor FF specimens ( A4 and B4) under negative bending, the observed\ncrackling loads were about 20 to Z5% of the ultimate loads.\n\n\nThe cracks initiated from the bottom face of the slab components and\ntraversed through the slab thickness into the beam components.\n\n\nAs in the case of FF specimens under positive bending, more cracks\nwere seen in the shear span than in the flexural span and these were also\ninclined at about 45 to the longitudinal axis.\n\n\nNear the ultimate load, spalling of cement mortar along the location\nof longitudinal skeletal steel at the webs of specimen B4 were observed.\n\n\nIn all the specimens, the spacing of cracks was relatively small and\nthe crack widths were of a magnitude less than 0.2 mm under an assumed\nservice load equal to 1/1.6 of the ultimate load.\n\n\nThis Ls probably due to the restraining effects of the reinforcement\nof the ferrocement.\n\n\nStrain profile and local slip Strain measurements across the depth of\nthe composite beams indicated that, in general, a continuity of longitudinal\nstrain exists across the interface between the slab and the beam components.\n\n\nThus, the shear connectors provided were adequate in ensuring\ncomposite action in the specimens at ultimate load conditions.\n\n\nThis was further confirmed by the measurements of the transducers\nplaced at the two ends of the specimens, which registered local slip between\nthe components of less than 0.2 mm under the assumed service load, and less\nthan 1 mm near the ultimate load.\n\n\nDeflection under assumed service loads The mid-span deflection of\neach specimen under the assumed service load is indicated in Table 1.\n\n\nIn general, the maximum deflection under the assumed service load is\nless than 9.5 mm, or 1/280 of the span of the specimen.\n\n\nMode of failure and ultimate strength The FS composite specimens\nfailed in flexure and showed considerable ductility near the ultimate load (\nsee Flg 4(a) and ( b)).\n\n\nThe ductile behavior was terminated by shear failure of the slab\ncomponents in specimens Al and Bl.\n\n\nThis happened when a diagonal crack propagated through the slab\ntowards the loading point, accompanied by delamination of the cement mortar\nfrom the bottom face of the slab.\n\n\nThe experimental ultimate loads agreed very well with the predicted\nvalues based on the method of strain compatibility and equilibrium ( see\nTable 1).\n\n\nThe FF specimens were found to fall abruptly in shear.\n\n\nThis occurred when inclined cracks widened excessively and crushing\nof the cement mortar at the tips of the cracks near the loading point was\nobserved.\n\n\nThe observed ultimate shear strength ranged between 35 to 77X of the\npredicted ultimate flexural strength.\n\n\nFig 5 shows some of the test specimens at failure.\n\n\n CONCLUSIONS \n\n\nThe study reported in this paper explored the use of ferrocement in\ncomposite construction.\n\n\nEight composite beams were tested, either in positive or in negative\nbending. \n\n\nThe specimens registered crack widths of less than O.2 mm and\nmaximum deflection of less than 1/280 of the span under an assumed service\nload of 1/1.6 times the ultimate load.\n\n\nA11 the specimens exhibited composite action at ultimate load\ncondition.\n\n\nThe FS beams were found to fall in flexure and possessed\nconsiderable ductility at failure, thus indicating their suitability in\nconstruction.\n\n\nHowever, the FF beams were found to fall abruptly in shear and\nfurther works in this area are necessary.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "CASE: The Vehicle for Effective Data Utilization \n\n\nHock Chuan Chan\n\n\nDepartment of Information Systems and Computer Science\n\n\nNational University of Singapore, Singapore\n\n\n Abstract \n\n\nThough examination of the processes involved in designing and using\ninformation systems that are heavily dependent on databases, it is shown that\nwhile the design of database models has been greatly assisted by CASE tools,\nthe usage has been largely left out.\n\n\nDevelopers can design the database model to the conceptual level while\nCASE tools transform that into a model at the logical level for\nimplementation.\n\n\nHowever, usage of the database demands that queries be written based\non the logical level model.\n\n\nThis paper calls for CASE tool developers and researchers to provide\ntools for people to effectively utilize data and information systems at the\nconceptual level.\n\n\n 1. Introduction \n\n\nThere are two opposing views on the use of computers.\n\n\nOne maintains that computers should not change existing procedures.\n\n\nThere are valid reasons, mostly social.\n\n\nFor example, if computers redefine a person's job, or redraw a\ndepartment's territory, people adversely affected will be reluctant to accept\nthe new computer system.\n\n\nEven when there are no obvious disadvantages, changes of systems and\nprocedures are psychologically threatening to many people.\n\n\nAn example of a system in accord with this view is a virtual reality\nsystem that gives users a virtual room with tables, in/out trays, cabinets\nand shelves to simulate a real office.\n\n\nThe other view is that computers should actively change existing\nprocedures, instead of merely computerizing them.\n\n\nThis appears to be the case for most system development.\n\n\nFor example, ATM machines change the way that banking services are\nprovided.\n\n\nWith the second view in mind, it is argued that CASE tools has an\nimportant role that needs to be more actively pursued.\n\n\nThis is especially so for CASE tools that support database\ndevelopment.\n\n\nWhile there are many tools to help software developers in modeling\ndatabases, there are very few to help actual database usage.\n\n\nIt is timely for CASE tools to incorporate modules to assist, change\nand upgrade the usage of data, since data utilization is considered by IS\nmanagers to be an important and critical MIS issue [ 11,12].\n\n\nSection 2 describes in detail the discrepancy in CASE support for\ndata modeling and data usage.\n\n\nSection 3 discusses the additional functions needed for CASE tools.\n\n\nSection 4 is the conclusion of the paper.\n\n\n 2. Data modeling and use \n\n\nIn data modeling, there are two main levels of abstraction: the\nconceptual level and the logical level [ 3, 6, 7, 13, 18].\n\n\nMost database design with end-user involvement is at the conceptual\nlevel.\n\n\nThe most common model used for conceptual design in the entity\nrelationship model [ 3, 18, 19].\n\n\nThis stage is actively supported by many CASE systems [ 2,\n8,10,14,15, 16, 17, 20].\n\n\nMany CASE systems will automatically generate a set of relations to\nsupport the conceptual model.\n\n\nSome will even generate the specific codes to define the database for\na particular database management system, such as in SQL codes.\n\n\nTransformation from the conceptual model to the logical model has\nlittle input from the database designer and even less from the end-users.\n\n\nSo far, we see that design is well supported.\n\n\nWhen we consider the usage of data, a different picture appears.\n\n\nWhen the developers want to write programs that access the database,\ndo they write the queries based on the conceptual model?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nThey write based on the logical model.\n\n\nWhen end-users want to retrieve data, they also have to formulate the\nqueries based on the logical model which they know little about.\n\n\nExperiments have shown that the conceptual models are much easier to\ndesign and use than the logical models [ 4, 5, 9].\n\n\nHence, it is clear that the important area of data utilization is not\nsupported by current CASE tools.\n\n\nThis is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows that design is done in\nthree clear stages with CASE support.\n\n\nIn contrast, data usage is done with absolutely no CASE support, and\nwithout any clear stages.\n\n\nThe unsupported users include end-users doing ah hoc queries as well\nas developers writing application programs.\n\n\nIt is important to raise the level of query writing and data access\nfrom the logical to the conceptual level [ 1, 5].\n\n\n 3. Proposed CASE modules \n\n\nAt least two additional modules are needed for CASE tools in order to\nredress the imbalance in support.\n\n\nThese are conceptual level query module and implementation query code\ngenerator.\n\n\nThe conceptual level query module is to allow queries to be\nformulated based on the conceptual model.\n\n\nThis module may be textual, menu, or even graphical.\n\n\nThe advantage is that usage will be based on the more familiar human\ndesigned conceptual model rather than the computer generated logical model.\n\n\nThere is also less transformation from the application world to the\nconceptual model than to the logical model.\n\n\nThereby, the query formulation process will be easier [ 5].\n\n\nThe query code generator will accept the conceptual model query\nspecification, and generate the query code needed for the implementation\nsystem.\n\n\nThe generator will need to know the following:\n\n\n1. structural transformation between the conceptual model and the\nlogical model.\n\n\nFor example, in the case of ER and relational models, it needs to\nknow how a relationship and its attributes are stored in the relations.\n\n\n2. operational transformation between the conceptual model and the\nlogical model.\n\n\nFor example, it needs to know how inheritance in the ER model is to\nbe done with the relational operators.\n\n\nIt also needs to know how a relationship can be reconstructed by join\noperations on relevant relations and fields.\n\n\n3. the syntax of the query system for the implementation system.\n\n\nThis can be SQL, QUEL or any of the languages for the many commercial\nDBMSs.\n\n\nResearch prototypes of parts of these modules have been developed.\n\n\nThese need to be extended and incorporated into commercial CASE\nsystems.\n\n\nFor example, the translations of entity relationship retrieval\nqueries into SQL is given in [ 7, 15].\n\n\nBut so far, no translation of update queries have been done.\n\n\nThe present retrieval translations are dependent on a certain fixed\nmethod of transforming entity relationship models to relations.\n\n\nThis transformation may not be true in actual practice where\nefficiency considerations may result in physical level designs.\n\n\nWhere the conceptual model is re-engineered from a set of existing\nrelations, the transformation is almost certain to be different from that\nassumed by the translation algorithms.\n\n\nIt is unrealistic to demand a total redesign of existing relations.\n\n\nHence the translation algorithm must be redesigned to cater to\nvarious transformation.\n\n\nWe can expect the advantages of reverse engineering to be increased\nwith the query modules.\n\n\nFrom an existing implementation, reverse engineering can generate the\nhigh level conceptual model.\n\n\nWithout the proposed modules, this conceptual model will be nearly\nuseless for data access, since the formulation and coding will still be based\non the old logical model.\n\n\nThe query modules will allow the coexistence of new and old\napplications based on different models.\n\n\nWhile existing applications can continue to run on the existing\nlogical model, new application can be written using conceptual query based on\nthe new conceptual model.\n\n\nThis facilitates a smooth transition from logical level programming\nto conceptual level programming.\n\n\nThis architecture is illustrated in Figure 2.\n\n\nIntegration of these modules with other CASE tools is very important.\n\n\nResearch on entity relationship queries have concentrated on stand\nalone interactive ad hoc queries, similar to interactive SQL.\n\n\nWhile this will be very helpful for end-users to satisfy their ad hoc\nneeds for data access, it will be quite useless for developers writing\nprograms that access the data.\n\n\nEmbedded version of conceptual queries must be made available,\nsimilar to the embedding of SQL in conventional programming languages.\n\n\nThen special treatment will have to be designed.\n\n\nOne way is to have a pre-compiler to translate conceptual query to\nimplementation query ( e.g.\n\n\nSQL), and then using the pre-compiler for SQL This way is not\nsatisfactory, as error messages and debugging may ultimately have to be based\non the logical model and the implementation language again, thus defeating\nthe aim of having programming and data access at the conceptual level.\n\n\nThe ideal will be to develop a compiler that can handle the\nprogramming language and the conceptual query together.\n\n\nThe interface is another area for integration.\n\n\nWith various facilities to access data, such as form-filling systems,\nmenu systems and command line systems, these should be fully integrated to be\nbased on the conceptual model and query.\n\n\nUsers should not have to switch models when they switch interfaces.\n\n\nIntegration with current systems and languages should also be done.\n\n\nThe common target language presently appears to be SQL.\n\n\nsince SQL is now the standard query language for relational systems.\n\n\nHowever, with the diverse CASE tools running on various platforms and\nenvironments, linkages to non-relational systems and other implementation\nlanguages will be necessary.\n\n\n 4. Conclusion \n\n\n<The paper has highlighted an imbalance i n CASE support given to\ndata modeling and data usage.\n\n\nTwo modules to redress the imbalance are proposed for integration\nwith the list of CASE tools.\n\n\nThese will support the usage of data at the conceptual model level.\n\n\nThe research issues for development and integration of these modules\ninto CASE tools are highlighted.\n\n\nThe advantages of incorporating these into commercial CASE tools\ninclude raising the level of programming for developers and better end-user\nad hoc queries.\n\n\nProductivity gains can be expected.\n\n\nIn addition, it is demonstrated how these modules can ease the\ntransition of existing systems to new systems when reverse engineering is\ndone.\n\n\nThey allow existing systems to operate side by side with new\nsystems. \n\n\n\n\n Ergonomic Design of Seat to Reduce Postural Stress \n\n\nJohn C K Wong & Samuel Y E Lim\n\n\nSchool of Mechanical & Production Engineering, Nanyang Technological\nUniversity\n\n\nNanyang Avenue, Singapore 2263\n\n\nBackaches are frequent complaints of those required to work in a\nseated position for prolonged periods of time.\n\n\nA method of reducing the postural stress is to provide the workers\nwith the highest possible level of comfort in their sitting position.\n\n\nThe aim of this project is to design a prototype seating system\nbased on the concept of variable profile backrest type of support for the\nvertebral column.\n\n\nThe objective is to allow the worker to sit comfortable in his/her\npreferred posture, while at the same time support the vertebral column as\nclose to its natural curvatures as possible.\n\n\nThe prototypes will be used in the study of the preferred seating\narrangement for the local population.\n\n\nA possible lateral application of the prototype is the design and\ndevelopment of custom-made seats for those with unusual back profiles or for\nthose suffering from severe postural &orders.\n\n\nA prototype of the variable profile backrest seating system has been\ndesigned and constructed ( Fig 1).\n\n\nThe backrest mechanism is comprised of 22 segments, spanning\napproximately from the occiput to the lumbar region.\n\n\nEach segment allows up to 300 mm of horizontal displacement at that\nparticular spinal level.\n\n\nMovements of each individual segment is independent of all the other\nsupporting segments.\n\n\nEach segment is also spring-loaded to allow it to return to its\nneutral position once the locking mechanism is released.\n\n\nThe complete assembly of the variable profile backrest mechanism can\nbe adjusted from the vertical position to an inclination of about 120@ with\nrespect to the seat pan.\n\n\nThus providing additional flexibility for maximum seating comfort.\n\n\nOther factors such seat height, seat depth, and seat-pan angle are\nalso adjustable.\n\n\nA simple lever mechanism activates the variable profile backrest\nmechanism.\n\n\nIt releases the normally locked backrest segments to enable them to\nconform to the desirable anterio-posterior curves of the spine.\n\n\nWhen the most comfortable sitting posture has been achieved, a\nsingle lever action secures all segments of the backrest in their preferred\npositions.\n\n\nA study on the effectiveness and acceptance of the prototype has\nbeen carried out on a group of student subjects.\n\n\nThe results have indicated that the variable profile backrest\nconcept is well accepted by the subjects, with a large majority being very\nsatisfied with the new seating system. \n\n\nComfort and good lumbar support were singled out as the most\nsignificant improvements of the new seating system.\n\n\nHowever, a drawback of the prototype is its rather large and\nimposing backrest mechanism.\n\n\nCurrently, a more compact prototype of the variable profile\nbackrest system is being built.\n\n\nThe prototypes will be used in the study of the preferred seating\narrangement for the local population.\n\n\nA possible lateral application of the prototype is the design and\ndevelopment of custom-made seats for those with unusual back profiles or\nthose suffering from severe disorders.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '2835235f-8825-4684-9ebb-048164f18b1a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.734083+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9327903985977173, 'non_english_score': 0.06720960140228271}
{'text': 'Rotational microwave moulding of expandable polystyrene \n\n\nH.Y.\n\n\nYeong and S.W.\n\n\nLye\n\n\n Introduction \n\n\nExpandable polystyrene ( EPS), or Styrofoam as it is commonly known,\nis used widely as a packaging material for the protection of goods that are\nlikely to be damaged during transportation, storage or handling.\n\n\nThe EPS-moulded article or cushion is produced commercially by means\nof a process quite similar to the plastic injection process, except that the\nheat required for fusion of the EPS material beads is obtained by injecting\nsteam into the aluminium mould.\n\n\nAfter fusion, the mould is cooled before the moulded cushion is\nejected .\n\n\nSuch inefficient use of energy, because of the cyclic heating and\nsubsequent cooling of the mould, has led to investigations using microwave\nenergy as an alternative source of energy for the processing of EPS.\n\n\nEarlier studies carried out using microwave energy were unable to\nproduce desired quality cushions without the inclusion of\ncarboxylmethylcellulose ( CMC), a binding agent to assist fusion of the beads\n[ 1], or sodium chloride, a water-soluble salt used to raise the boiling\npoint of water to 110@C to enable fusion to take place [ 2].\n\n\nThese investigations provided an indication that microwave energy can\nbe used in the processing of EPS.\n\n\nHowever, the addition of a binding agent or surfactant is\nunacceptable in the packaging industry especially in the packaging of\nsensitive electronic products as these agents are likely to contaminate and\ncorrode the finished goods.\n\n\nA later study conducted by Yeong et al., [ 3] used only water as the\nmedium to assist fusion of the EPS beads.\n\n\nIn this study, the EPS cushions were moulded using pre-expanded beads\nas in the commercial process as well raw EPS beads, thereby eliminating the\nintermediary pre-expansion stage.\n\n\nVarious process parameters and the quality of the moulded cushion\nwere studied.\n\n\nThe dimensional accuracy and uniformity of the bulk density of the\ncushion were found to be comparable to those attained in commercial moulded\nproducts using the steam-injection process.\n\n\nHowever, in these studies [ 3], using a custom-designed mould, two\nmain problems were faced.\n\n\nFirstly, fusion of the beads, especially close to the top of the\nmould, was not entirely satisfactory and secondly, the compressive strength\nof the moulded cushion was not completely explored and comparisons made with\ncommercially-processed cushions.\n\n\nIn the present investigation, these two problems have been addressed.\n\n\nPreliminary investigations were made by placing the mould in the\nhorizontal and vertical planes to study the effect on the fusion of the\nmoulded cushion.\n\n\nSubsequently, a mechanism was designed and used to rotate the mould\nduring processing in an attempt to achieve better fusion.\n\n\nThe compressive strength of the moulded cushions at various bulk\ndensities was investigated also.\n\n\n 2. Experimental procedure \n\n\n 2.1. Equipment and material \n\n\nIn this investigation, a Goldstar microwave oven, model ER-761 ME,\nwas used.\n\n\nA Mettler PC440 electronic weighing machine was employed to determine\nthe quantity of EPS material used and the weight of the final moulding.\n\n\nTo measure the compressive strength of the cushion samples; an\nInstron machine was used: this machine has a 10 kN load cell and a software\npackage for interface and control.\n\n\nThe materials used in the experiments were from BASF and Grade 712\nfrom Dyno Chemical.\n\n\n 2.2. Bakelite mould \n\n\nIn a microwave environment, metal moulds are not suitable.\n\n\nTo enable fusion of the EPS material to take place at over 100 C and\nto withstand the expansion pressure in the mould, the mould material used\nshould be heat resistant to at least 120C and be pressure resistant to about\n3 bar 14].\n\n\nA phenolic, bakelite, was used to fabricate the mould as it meets\nthese specifications.\n\n\nThe mould was designed and fabricated to produce a product of\ncylindrical shape with a blind hole at the centre, as shown in Fig.\n\n\n1.\n\n\nThe mould is slightly tapered ( at an angle of 2@) to facilitate\neasier ejection of the cushion.\n\n\nThe wall thickness of the moulding was designed to be 12 mm to limit\npressure built-up during expansion and fusion of the EPS material.\n\n\n 3. Rotating mechanism \n\n\nTo promote better fusion, a rotating device was designed and\nfabricated to rotate the mould about its horizontal axis during processing of\nthe EPS.\n\n\nThe purpose of this mechanism is to rotate the mould such that the\nEPS beads were allowed to flow evenly within the mould cavity at the early\nstage of expansion of the bends.\n\n\nTeflon was chosen, as the material is easily merchantable and can\nwithstand the high temperature in the microwave oven.\n\n\nThe design of the rotating device consists basically of a rigid frame\nstructure which houses the clamping device and a series of matching gears, as\nshown in Fig.\n\n\n2. The working principle of the rotating device involves the\ntransmission and translation of the horizontal rotary motion mechanism in the\nmicrowave oven turntable into a vertical rotary motion of the mould.\n\n\nFlexibility in attaining different angular velocities is catered for\nwithin the design by incorporating a provision for the easy change of the\nbevel gear ratio and the bushing height.\n\n\nIn addition, the clamping device also provides the easy fastening of\nthe mould to the frame structure, thereby attaining ease of operation for the\nrotating mechanism.\n\n\n 2.4. Moulding of the cushions \n\n\nTwo series of experiments were carried out.\n\n\nThe first series was carried out to improve the uniformity in the\nfusion of the moulded cushion.\n\n\nPreliminary tests were carried out by placing the mould in two other\nstatic orientations ( horizontally and inverted) to determine the effect ( if\nany) on the fusion.\n\n\nAfter this the rotating mechanism was used to determine if the fusion\nof the moulded cushion could be improved.\n\n\nIn the second series of experiments, cushions moulded without the use\nof the rotating mechanism were used to determine the compressive strengths at\nvarious bulk densities of the cushions.\n\n\n3.\n\n\nResults and discussions Since the process parameters that affect the\ndimensional accuracy and the bulk densities of the moulded cushions had been\ndetermined earlier [ 3], only the uniformity of fusion and the variation of\nthe compressive strength with bulk density were investigated in the present\nstudy.\n\n\n 3.1. Preliminary tests with different mould orientations \n\n\nPrevious experimentation carried out [ 3] revealed some degree of\npoor fusion at the top of the bakelite mould.\n\n\nThis was probably due to the static position of the mould during\nprocessing.\n\n\nAs the EPS material beads were at the bottom of the mould, expansion\ncan only proceed upwards towards the top of the mould.\n\n\nHowever, as expansion proceeded, fusion also took place and in the\nprocess prevented moisture or steam from reaching the top of the mould.\n\n\nFurthermore, any steam near the top of the mould would have escaped\nfrom the air holes provided in the mould cover.\n\n\nThe top EPS beads, deprived of steam, would thus not fuse\nsufficiently.\n\n\nTo study the effect the mould orientation may have on fusion, two\nsets of experiments were carried out.\n\n\nMould tilted sideways The results of the experiments conducted using\nthe same process parameters with the mould tilted sideways ( horizontally as\nshown in Fig.\n\n\n3) are provided in Table 1 ( see also Fig.\n\n\n4).\n\n\nInspection of the moulded cushion revealed that again the top of the\nmoulding had poorer fusion, also with smaller bead sizes than at be bottom\nside of the mould.\n\n\nThis observation could again be explained by the reasoning that steam\ncould not be properly channelled to the top side of the mould during\nprocessing.\n\n\n 3.1.2. Mould inverted \n\n\nUsing the same process parameters as in the mould-tilted-sideways\nexperiments, the results with the mould inverted ( as shown in Fig.\n\n\n5) are given in Table 2 ( see also Fig.\n\n\n6).\n\n\nWhen the cushion was inspected, it was found that the top surface of\nthe inverted moulding was properly fused but over-expanded, with some\nshrinkage being observed.\n\n\nThe bottom portion of the mould had good fusion.\n\n\nThe result was probably because the outlet air holes ( now at the\nbottom, since the mould is inverted) were sealed with the initial expansion\nand the fusion of the EPS beads at the mould bottom.\n\n\nThe steam that had already risen to the top was now trapped at the\ntop of the mould.\n\n\nThe presence of steam at the top probably caused the beads to fuse\nand over-expand and subsequently led to shrinkage of the cushion after\nejection. \n\n\n Table 2 \n\n\nDensity and fusion for inverted mould ( EPS quantity =lOmg,\nexpansion time = 3:30min) S/N Power level Density Fusion ( W) ( kg/m3) V1 350\n77.64 see Fig 6 V2 560 77.94 as with V1 Table 3 Density and fusion for rotary\nmoulding ( microwave power = 350 W, EPS quantity = 10 mg) S/N Expansion\nMoulding Fusion period density ( min) ( kg/m3) R1 4:30 91.1 voids at sides R2\n5:00 85.9 very good R3 5:30 destroyed \n\n\n 3.2. Moulding with rotating mechanism \n\n\nA set of experiments was conducted using the rotating mechanism,\nproviding rotational speed of the mould of 30 rpm.\n\n\nThe results obtained are shown in Table 3.\n\n\nUpon inspection of the moulded cushion it was found that the fusion\nof the moulding was good and uniform when compared with those moulded with\nthe static-position mould.\n\n\nThis indicates that the rotary motion allowed the material and\nwatersteam to flow in the mould during processing thereby providing\nopportunities for the beads to expand and fuse throughout the mould cavity.\n\n\n3.3. Determination of the variation of compressive strength with bulk\ndensity The compressive strength of the EPS mouldings is one of the\nfundamental considerations in the design of packaging cushions.\n\n\nFor the Styrofoam industry, the compressive strength is indicated by\nthe measured value at 10% deformation.\n\n\nAs an approximation, the design value used widely in industry to\nprovide adequate protection of the finished products should not exceed\ntwo-thirds of the measured of the compressive strength [ 5]. \n\n\n Table 4 \n\n\nBulk density and compressive measurements Compressive strength in\nDensity in ( kg/m3) for the 3 parts kNIm2 at 10% deformation S/N A B C Entire\nA B C S1 646.71 646.71 550.90 98.90 93.75 87.87 80.63 S2 266.90 434.56 670.67\n98.45 105.84 89.95 73.31 S3 465.36 533.80 379.82 99.31 81.40 78.40 92.16 S4\n609.07 684.35 509.84 98.41 102.80 87.32 76.03 S5 396.92 123.18 492.73 98.09\n89.59 78.19 86.49 average - - - 98.63 94.67 84.33 81.72 Table 5 Variations of\ncompressive strength ( kN/m2) at different bulk densities ( kN/m3) S/N\nDensity Density Compressive before after strength compression compression I1S\n66.34 105.79 413.8 I2S 84.22 134.09 699.3 I3S 89.19 142.12 725.0 I4S 93.16\n148.38 766.7 I5S 118.37 188.25 911.1 I6S 123.45 195.91 911.1 \n\n\nIt was also found that the compressive strength varies with the\ndensity of the cushion.\n\n\nProvided that the fusion of the moulded cushion is good and uniform,\nthe compressive strength is expected to be independent of the method used for\nmoulding the cushion.\n\n\nAs the compressive strength using microwave energy had not been\nmeasured in previous studies [ 3], a series of experiments and tests was\ncarried out to determine the compressive strength using moulded cushions\nprocessed ( without the rotating mechanism) from different quantities of EPS\nmaterial ( to obtain different bulk densities).\n\n\nThe Instron instrument was used to determine the compressive strength\nof the mouldings, with the cross-head speed of the equipment set at 5 mm/min\nin accordance with British Standards [ 6].\n\n\n 3.3.1. Measurement of compressive strength \n\n\nTo measure the compressive strength a moulding was cut into 3\nsections with the top and centre portion each of 15 mm height and the bottom\npiece of 20 mm height.\n\n\nTable 4 shows the measurement of the bulk density and the\ncorresponding compressive strength in kN/m2 at 10% deformation for these\nthree parts identified as A, B and C.\n\n\nThe load versus deformation graph for sample Sl il shown in Fig.\n\n\n7.\n\n\nThis graph indicated that the cushion specimen undergoes an initial\nelastic characteristic.\n\n\nOn further compression, the material undergoes permanent deformation\nwith the load increasing for the same unit deformation.\n\n\nThese experimentation results followed closely the results provided\nby BASF, the manufacturer of the raw EPS material [ 5].\n\n\nFrom Table 4, it can be further noted that localised variations in\ndensity and compressive strength exist.\n\n\nThis is to be expected, as the rate of expansion and fusion\nthroughout the mould would vary depending on the amount of steam passing\nthrough the beads.\n\n\nThe extreme result for compressive strength shown in sample S5\nsection B is probably due to localised poor fusion as the density remained\nquite consistent with the rest of the other samples.\n\n\n3.3.2.\n\n\nCompressive strength at various bulk densities i Test samples were\nobtained similarly from moulded cushions of different densities and the\ncompressive strengths were measured.\n\n\nThe results are presented in Table 5 and shown graphically in Fig.\n\n\n8.\n\n\nThe compressive strength measured at 10% deformation versus the bulk\ndensity of the cushion is shown in Fig.\n\n\n9 and indicates a proportional relationship between these two\nfactors, with the compressive strength increasing with higher bulk density.\n\n\nThis graph can serve as a guide for designers by providing\ninformation on the compressive strength of the cushion once he/she has\ndecided on the type and density of material to use for the protective\ncushion.\n\n\n 1.

{'text': "AN INTEGRATED TOOL FOR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OPERATIONAL PLANNING\nAND RESTORATION \n\n\nTeo Cheng Yu, FIEE\n\n\nSchool of Electrical and Electronic Engineering\n\n\nNanyang Technological University\n\n\nNanyang Avenue, Singapore 2263\n\n\n 1 INTRODUCTION \n\n\nLoad flow, short circuit calculation and protective relay\nco-ordination are separate tools most commonly used for power distribution\nsystem operational planning.\n\n\nHowever, these programs are normally run one at a time repeatedly, and\nit is not convenient to simulate switching operation interactively.\n\n\nFor severe overloading that results in cascaded tripping across he\nnetwork, normal load flow program may not be able to handle due to too many\nisolated nodes and split networks.\n\n\nFurthermore, in an interconnected distribution network, it is very\ndifficult to determine the appropriate setting of the overcurrent relays [ 1]\nto ensure that only the selected equipment should operate to isolate the\nfault in the system so as to affect minimum interruption to consumers.\n\n\nThis paper introduces a microcomputer-based interactive distribution\nsystem simulator which provides an integrated tool with full graphic features\nand SCADA type of operating environment for engineers to perform conveniently\nthe complete task of operational planning in one single process.\n\n\nIn additional to the built-in automated L load flow, automated fault\ncurrent calculation, it integrates the modelling of protective relay,\ncalculation of tripping time and the tripping of breakers followed by post\nfault load flow calculation.\n\n\nIt also includes the interactive simulation of restoration of supply\nby the user.\n\n\nThus, this integrated tool not only can be used to assess the\ndistribution system under various loading conditions but it can also be used\nto assess thc grading of overcurrent relays under various fault and\noverloading conditions.\n\n\n 2 MODELLING AND MANIPUIATION \n\n\n 2.1 Distribution System Representation \n\n\nEach distribution system is defined and represented in the simulator\nby two files named NAMEID.DAT and NAMEID.DW where NAMEID is the name of a\nparticular distribution system.\n\n\nThus, different distribution system can be represented by using\ndifferent NAMEID.\n\n\nThe DAT file contains not only the basic network parameters such as\nnumber of busbars, number of lines, busbar loading, line and transformer\nimpedance, line and transformer connection, source impedance, etc., but also\nthe breaker open/close status, and the CT ratio, type of relay, relay setting\nof each breaker etc.\n\n\nThe DW file is a picture file which is used to generate the single\nline diagram of the distribution system.\n\n\nWith these two data files and the built-in fault current calculation,\novercurrent relay modelling and load flow, plus the necessary facilities for\nman-machine interface, a distribution simulator can thus be constructed by\nsoftware in a microcomputer.\n\n\nDuring run-time, after a particular distribution system has been\nselected, the simulator reads the picture file NAMEID.DW and displays the\nsingle line diagram on the VDU.\n\n\nBased on all the network parameters including breaker open/close\nstatus from the file NAMEID.DAT, the simulator calculates load flow and\ndisplays current flow for each line on the single line-diagram.\n\n\nThe simulator will then constantly monitor each breaker status,\nfeeder loading and model the operation of all protective relays.\n\n\nIf a fault is applied by the user, the simulator calculates the fault\ncurrent distribution and the operating time of all the relays.\n\n\nThe breaker connected to the relay which has the lowest operating\ntime will trip.\n\n\nWhenever any breaker trips and hence alters the network\nconfiguration, the simulator determines whether the fault has been totally\nisolated.\n\n\nIf the fault is not isolated, it re-calculates the fault current\ndistribution and continues the modelling of all the relays repeatedly until\nsome other breakers trip and the fault is totally isolated.\n\n\nFor example, for a busbar fault at busbar 6, the tripping time of\nseven breakers operated by the overcurrent relays to isolate the fault is\nshown in Figure 1.\n\n\nIf no fault is applied to the system or after the fault has been\nisolated, the simulator calculates load flow and displays the current flow on\nthe single line diagram as show in fig 2.\n\n\nAt the same time, each line current is injected to the corresponding\nrelay to test for overload.\n\n\nIf the overload exceeds the relay setting, the relay may then\noperates and the breaker will trip.\n\n\nThe stimulator hence re-calculates load flow, as the network\nconfiguration has altered, and continues the modelling of all the overcurrent\nrelays until there is no overloaded tripping detected.\n\n\nFacilities are also provided for the user to interrupt the process,\nand restore supply by switching on or off the appropriate breaker, reducing\nthe substation load or adjusting the relay settings.\n\n\n 2.2 Interactive User Manipulation \n\n\nThe user manipulation is interactive and made similar to that\ncommonly used in a supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA) control\ncentre.\n\n\nThc user can elect to operate ( ie open, close or block) a breaker\nand the simulator will generate a special cursor to guide the user to select\nthe desired breaker.\n\n\nOverloading or fault at any busbar or any line terminal can be\nactivated conveniently on the single line diagram using menu driven function\nkeys by the user, or generated randomly by the simulator.\n\n\nSimilarly, loading at each substation can be updated interactively\nthrough the pop-up window ( as shown in Figure 3) by the user with the option\nfor random load to be increased up to a pre-specified limit.\n\n\nDuring run-time, the current plug setting ( PS) and the time\nmultiplier setting ( MS) of each overcurrent relay can be viewed or changed\nthrough the pop-up window ( as shown in Figure 4).\n\n\nEach breaker can also be blocked to simulate the breaker or relay\nfailure so that the breaker will not trip during any fault condition and the\neffect of the upstream relay operation can be assessed.\n\n\n2.3 Overcurrent relay Modelling Three types of inverse definite\nminimum time ( IDMT) overcurrent relays based on BS]42 are modelled.\n\n\nAdditional compensation is made to take into account the fact that\nthe fault current sensed by each relay may not be constant in an\ninterconnected network.\n\n\nThe relay constant K expressed as a multiple of the relay's setting\ncurrent can be defined as [ 2]: \n\n\nK = If x 100 ( 1) CTP x PS where If = constant fault current in\namperes, CTP = current transformer primary current rating in amperes and PS =\nrelay plug setting in percentage.\n\n\nThe time/ current characteristic of an IDMT overcurrent relay for a\ngiven fault current 1f can be expressed as:\n\n\nFor Normal Inverse Overcurrent Relay 0.14 t = 0.14 K 0.02 - 1 x TMS\n\n\nFor Very Inverse Overcurrent Relay t= 13.5 K - 1 x TMS\n\n\nFor Extremely Inverse Overcurrent Relay t = 80 K2-1 x TMS where t is\nthe operating time and TMS is the time multiplier sending of the IDMT\novercurrent relay.\n\n\nThe tripping time of an overcurrent relay under variable fault\ncurrents may be compensated as follows [ 2]: % t Comp = t ( If2) x % Comp (\nIf1,S fast) ( 5) where If1 is the original fault current causing the tripping\nof the faster relay operated in Sfast second.\n\n\nIt has altered the network configuration and hence it results in a\nnew fault current If2 passing through this relay.\n\n\nThe percentage compensation of a particular overcurrent relay is\ndefined as: % Comp = 100% - Sfast x lOO% ( 6) t(If1) \n\n\nFor example, consider a relay which has a CT ratio of 300/5, PS=150%\nand TMS = 0.9.\n\n\nIf the fault current passing through this relay is 8kA for 0.3\nsecond; and it the then reduces to 7kA due to the operation of some other\nfaster relay which has operated in 0.3 second, the operating time of this\nrelay can bc calculated as from equations ( 1) to ( 6). \n\n\nK= 8000 x 100 = 17.78 300 x 150 t ( 8 kA) = 0.14 = 2.127 seconds\n17.78 0.02 - 1 % Comp = 100% - 0.3 x 100% = 85.89% 2.127\n\n\nSimilarly, the operating time of the relay at 7 kA is t ( 7kA) =\n2.233 seconds tComp ( 8kA,7kA) = 2.233 x 85.89% = 1.918seconds \n\n\n 3 APPLICATIONS \n\n\n 3.1 Assessment of Overcurrent Relay Setting \n\n\nDistribution system is usually designed to cater for the\ninterconnection of more than one source but may be operated radially through\nnetwork cut.\n\n\nHowever, there are cases that this network cut may have to be closed\nto form a ring temporarily or permanently to increase the reliability and to\nmaintain a high level of continuity of supply.\n\n\nOvercurrent relays, however, are usually graded according to the\nnetwork operated radially feeding from one source only.\n\n\nWhat will be the performance of these relays during fault and\noverloading conditions when this network is operated as ring with two sources\nor even interconnected with more than two sources?\n\n\nUnder various fault conditions, what will be the tripping sequence\nand how serious will be the loss of supply?\n\n\nThese operational problems can be verified or examined\nstraightforwardly in one single run by using this simulator.\n\n\nThe engineer may even vary the setting scheme and observes the effect\nduring the simulated fault or overloading conditions and works out the\nnecessary adjustment in setting when the network configuration changed.\n\n\nHe may also block a particular break to simulate breaker failure or\nthe malfunction of the relay and examine the operation of other relays.\n\n\n 3.2 System Security Assessment \n\n\nDue to load growth and many other reasons, the load at each\nsubstation is usually quite different from the load estimated during design\nstage.\n\n\nThus, in actual operation, some feeders may be heavily loaded but\nsome other feeders may be no load at all.\n\n\nIn terms of security of supply, should the network be operated as\nradial, or ring, or mixed?\n\n\nIf it is operated as radial, how do we recommend the appropriate\nnetwork cut?\n\n\nUnder various feeder conditions, can supply to the whole area be\nstill maintained?\n\n\nThis integrated tool was designed to assist engineer to solve all the\nabovementioned operational problems through simulations.\n\n\nFurthermore, it also provides options to increase the load at any\nsubstation and/or to apply a controlled random load increase to all\nsubstations.\n\n\nThese options can thus be used to activate various overloading\nconditions which will trip some breakers and if it is severely overloaded, it\nmay result in cascaded tripping across the network.\n\n\nThe engineer can then practice on how to restore the supply, examine\nhow to interconnect the split network and see if the total load can be\nsupplied with only one or two feeders available.\n\n\nThe engineer can also locate the critical feeders which when removed\ngenerate the greatest number of network overloading and then re-distribute\nthe load whenever possible.\n\n\n 3.3 Establish Rules for Restoration of Supply \n\n\nSupply interruption is always un-avoidable and the operational\nengineer has to depend on his experience and his knowledge on the\ndistribution system to isolate the fault and to restore supply.\n\n\nThis integrated tool provides the platform for a engineer to generate\nstandard rules for the restoration of supply well in advance.\n\n\nBased on the actual loading condition and the network configuration,\nthe engineer can generate various abnormal condition such as a line fault, a\nbusbar fault, a major incoming failure, a minor overloading, a serious\noverloading, etc.\n\n\nwhich will trip some breakers and result in loss of supply.\n\n\nThe engineer can then restore the supply on the simulator and then\nworks out the standard procedure or rules for the restoration of supply for\neach abnormal case.\n\n\nThese rules can also be updated updated whenever major load increased\nor network configuration changed.\n\n\n 3.4 Evaluate and Test Distribution Network Proposals \n\n\nFor new development, two or three different network proposals are\nusually suggested.\n\n\nThis integrated tool can be used to evaluate each network proposal\nunder various fault and overloading conditions.\n\n\nThe level of reliability of each proposal and its operating\nconstraints and limits can be compared easily through this simulation.\n\n\nA better network proposal can then be recommended.\n\n\nFurthermore, the setting of overcurrent relays can be verified and\nadjusted before installation.\n\n\n 3.5 Engineer Training \n\n\nThis simulator can also be used to train new practising engineering\nto familiarize with the interconnected distribution system and the associated\novercurrent protective scheme, the possible fault and overloading conditions.\n\n\nIt gives practising engineers the opportunity to witness first hand\nhow a power system behaves under various fault or overloading conditions;\ntheir consequences; the proper diagnosis procedures; and the recovery\nactions.\n\n\nIt provides hands on exercise to practise logical thinking to\nidentify the type of abnormal conditions, to isolate the fault and to carry\nout the appropriate actions to restore supply in a typical distribution\nsystem.\n\n\nBased on the relay settings viewed from the network, the engineer can\nalso select the random fault option with a hidden fault location and analyse\nthe timing of the tripping sequence to identify the type of fault and its\nlocation.\n\n\nAn option to reveal the hidden location can then be activated to\nconfirm the finding.\n\n\n4.\n\n\nComputing Techniques and Approximation The stimulator is implemented\nin an IBM PC - AT or compatible running at 8 MHz with EGA colour monitor and\nno printer or other hardware is required.\n\n\nThe operating system is DOS 3.3 and all the application programs\nincluding graphic handling, pull down menu and pop-up windows are all written\nin Turbo Pascal version 6.",

Diffusion bonding \n\n\nI) Diffusion bonding is essentially a micro-deformation process which\njoins two solid surfaces using applied load at elevated temperature in vacuum\nor protective atmosphere.\n\n\nThe load applied must be sufficiently low to avoid macro deformation\nof the parent materials, whilst the temperatures employed are usually 0.5-\n0.8Tm, where Tm is the absolute melting temperature of the lesser refractory\nmaterial.\n\n\nProcessing time at temperature depends very much on the bond strength\nrequired and on the materials involved.\n\n\nTypically, this ranges from several hours at about 0.6Tm to only\nminutes at 0.8Tm.\n\n\nCline [ 9] proposed a two-stage mechanism for the diffusion bonding\nprocess.\n\n\nFirstly, the applied load causes plastic deformation of surface\nasperities, particularly on the softer of the two mating surfaces, which\nreduces the interfacial voids.\n\n\nSubsequently, the bond develops by diffusion controlled mechanisms\nsuch as grain-boundary diffusion and power-law creep.\n\n\nToday, there are many theoretical models designed to predict the\ndominant mechanism at the various stages of diffusion bonding [ 10].\n\n\nHot isostatic pressing diagrams are also provided to relate the\nrespective mechanisms to the processing parameters [ 1].\n\n\nFigure 1 shows, schematically, the sequential mechanism of diffusion\nbonding between ceramic and metal as proposed by Derby [ 12].\n\n\nTo form an effective bond, the mating surfaces must come into close\natomic contact.\n\n\nHence, the original surface finishes must be good and free from\ncontaminants.\n\n\nWith the relatively higher HIP pressures of 100-200 MPa, however,\nsurface finishes become less critical and finishes of 0.8 um Ra have been\nsuccessfully HIP-bonded [ 13].\n\n\nSystematic studies into the characteristics of ceramic/ metal\ninterfaces started in the early sixties.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, interaction at a ceramic / metal interface can be\nclassified as physical and chemical.\n\n\nThe former involves understanding the thermodynamic and physical\naspects of a non-reactive non-oxide ceramic / metal interface, where no\ncharge or mass transfer can take place.\n\n\nChemical interaction, however, can occur between metal and ceramic by\na redox-dissolution reaction or a solution reaction in a reducing gas\natmosphere [ 14].\n\n\nThis creates an interfacial phase at the ceramic / metal junction\nwhich differs structurally and physically from the parent materials.\n\n\nSuch a layer of reaction product can either enhance adhesivity or\nlower the bond strength of the ceramic / metal couple.\n\n\nThis paper provides some laboratory results on the effects of HIP\nparameters on the diffusion shear bond strength of nickel onto alumina.\n\n\nThe shear tests were simply carried out by the conventional method [\n15] to evaluate the effects of treatment pressure, temperature and time.\n\n\nThe shear strength was calculated by dividing the maximum fracture\nload by the area of the interface.\n\n\nOwing to the configuration of the specimens and the differential CTEs\nof the alumina-nickel couple ( which is likely to induce residual stresses\nduring the cooling phase of the HIP cycle), the values are therefore not to\nbe regarded as pure shear stresses.\n\n\n 3 Experimental procedure \n\n\nPure and spherical nickel powder of sizes no larger than 45 um ( 325\nmesh) were used in this project, their chemical composition being shown in\nTable l.\n\n\nChemical composition of the nickel powder used in the present study\n\n\n\nCo Fe C Cu S Ni 0.089 0.009 0.017 0.002 0.036 99.847 \n\n\nThese were encapsulated together with alumina tubing of 12 mm ID,\n17.3 mm OD and 20 mm length.\n\n\nThe surfaces of the alumina tubing were cleansed ultrasonically\nbefore encapsulation.\n\n\nFor encapsulation, mild steel cans of 34 mm diameter, 60 mm height\nand 0.7 mm wall thickness were used.\n\n\nFilled capsules were capped by TIG welding and evacuated at 300@C to\nremove all traces of vapour and gases.\n\n\nThe evacuated capsules were then crimped and sealed at the evacuating\ntube; the whole process being carried out using a 'Dr Capsule' work-station\nas shown in Fig. 2.\n\n\nHipping was carried out using the 02-5X system as supplied by Kobe\nSteel Pte.\n\n\nLtd.\n\n\n( Fig.\n\n\n3).\n\n\nA molybdenum-element furnace was used and temperatures of 1150, 1200\nand 1250C were employed for this study.\n\n\nPressures of 120, 160 and 200 MPa by pure argon were used with\ntreatment times varying from 64 to 256 min.\n\n\nIn all instances, the HIP cycles employed were of type 4 [ 1] which\nincreases temperature and pressure simultaneously.\n\n\nAfter HIP, the capsules were de-canned by machining and cut into\nthree specimens using a diamond cutting machine.\n\n\nTwo specimens were used to determine the shear strength of the\nnickel-alumina bond whilst the third specimen was used for microstructural\nanalysis.\n\n\nX-ray diffractometry was employed also to analyse the compound formed\nat the interface.\n\n\nFigure 4 shows two Hipped specimens; the left one being de-canned in\npreparation for shear tests.\n\n\nThe shear strength tests were carried out using a Shimndzu\nServopulser ED-20 tensile testing machine with a push-through fixture\ndesigned and fabricated to ensure failure at the nickel-alumina interface.\n\n\n 4. Results and discussion </h  <>\n\n\n 4.1. Effect of pressure \n\n\nIsostatic pressures of 120, 160 and 200 MPa were employed to HIP the\nspecimens at 1200@C for 144 min.\n\n\nFigure 5 shows the effect of these pressures on the shear bond\nstrength.\n\n\nThere was only marginal improvement when the pressure was increased\nfrom 120 to 160 MPa.\n\n\nAt 200 MPa pressure, however, the shear bond strength was measured at\n38.2 MPa, which is 2.3 times the bond strength of 16.6 MPa which was achieved\nwith the lower HIP pressures.\n\n\nIt can be envisaged that higher HIP pressure will bring about a\nhigher level of plastic micro-deformation at the ceramic/metal interface.\n\n\nThis implies a lower density of interfacial voids, thereby increasing\nthe contact areas between the two parent materials for chemical reaction and\ninter-diffusion take place.\n\n\nThe effect of HIP pressure on the interphase layer was not\ndiscernible latter measuring an average thicknesses of 4 um.\n\n\n4.2.\n\n\nEffect of temperature Specimens were Hipped at 1150, 1200 and 1250@C\nfor 100 min using 200 MPA pressure.\n\n\nFigure 6 shows the effect of temperature on the interphase\nthicknesses and the respective shear bond strength.\n\n\nThe interphase layer increased with increasing temperature.\n\n\nFor 1150@C, this measured only 1.4 um increasing to 6.0 um with the\n1250@C treatment, which is in agreement with the Arrhenius equation of\nreaction.\n\n\nThe shear bond strength, however, reached a maximum of 38.2 MPa with\nthe 1200@C treatment, the interphase layer measuring an average of 2.7 um.\n\n\nHence, it would appear that the optimum bond strength is a function\nof the thickness of the interphase layer.\n\n\nA thin interphase layer may signify incomplete or weak chemical bond\nat the interface, thereby lowering the bond strength.\n\n\nOn other hand, a thick interphase layer of a complex compound may\nembrittle the ceramic / metal junction.\n\n\n 4.3. Effect of time \n\n\nHipping was carried out at 1200C, 200 MPa for 64, 100, 144 and 256\nmin.\n\n\nFigure 7 shows the effect of HIP treatment time on the interphase\nlayer and shear bond strength.\n\n\nWith increasing treatment time, chemical reaction and diffusion were\nallowed to continue at the ceramic/metal interface.\n\n\nHence, it is to be expected that the reaction layer will increase\nwith time.\n\n\nThe reaction rate time relationship, however, is yet to be\nestablished as three phenomenon are at play simultaneously: the sintering of\nnickel; the chemical reaction to form the interphase; and diffusion.\n\n\nOf note, though, is the observation that the maximum shear bond\nstrength was achieved with the 100-minute treatment.\n\n\nHere again, a drop in the shear bond strength is encountered with\ninterphase layers thinner or thicker than 2.7 um.\n\n\n 4.4. Nickel at aluminate spinel \n\n\nln all instances of the shear tests, a product light blue in colour\nobserved to be adhered onto the alumina tubing.\n\n\nThis was identified by diffractometry as the nickel aluminate spinel,\nNiAI204.\n\n\nFigure 8 is NiO-Al2O phase diagram [ 16] which shows considerable\nsolubility of Al203 in Ni/1204.\n\n\nIn general, therefore, the nickel aluminate is represented as NiO (\nl+x) Al203 with x varying from zero to a value, xn,, which defines a\nAl203-saturated composition.\n\n\nNiAI204 is the stoichiometric composition with x=0.\n\n\nElrefaie et al.\n\n\n[ 16] produced an xmax value of 0.38 for the Al20, - saturated\ncomposition at 1390'C.\n\n\nPrevious investigators had proposed that any spinel formation at the\nNi/AI203 interface must proceed through a NiO intermediate.\n\n\nBy experiment and thermodynamic calculation, however, Trumble et al.\n\n\n[ ] 7] showed otherwise.\n\n\nNickel aluminate spinel formation at the Ni/Al203 interface requires\nonly that the threshold oxygen activity be exceeded.\n\n\nFigure 9 shows their calculated threshold oxygen activity curve as a\nfunction of temperature [ 17].\n\n\nThe sources of oxygen in this project were believed to be oxygen\ninitially dissolved in solution in the nickel powders and residual oxygen in\nthe capsule before HIP, the capsule being pumped down only to 10-2 torr.\n\n\nClose examination of the sheared specimens showed that the nickel\naluminate was adhering to the Al203 tubing.\n\n\nHence, fracture paths had run along the spinel/nickel interface,\nwhich implies that the spinel/nickel interfaces were weaker than the\nspinel/Al2O3 interfaces.\n\n\nThe respective densities of nickel, spinel and Al203 in g/cm3 are\n8.9, 4.3 and 4.0.\n\n\nThus, the volumetric change accompanying the reaction at the spinel\n/ AI2O3 interface is comparatively smaller than that of the spinel/ Ni\ninterface, rendering the latter interface weaker in terms of bond strength.\n\n\nResearchers have been divided in opinion as to the spinel effect on\nthe bond integrity of the nickel / AI20 interface.\n\n\nSome like Bailey [ 18] claim that the spinel serves effectively to 'reaction\nbond' the ceramic/metal interface.\n\n\nOthers, however, feel that the spinel has a severe weakening effect.\n\n\nTrumble et al.\n\n\n[ 17] suggested avoiding spinel formation to ensure a strong bond\nbetween nickel and alumina.\n\n\nColin et al.\n\n\n[ 7], on the other hand, noted that the shear bond strength of\nInconel-600/alumina interface was much weaker without spinel formation.\n\n\nThey achieved a maximum shear bond strength of 70 MPa with 100 MPa\nof HIP pressure at 1300@C and 30 min of soaking time. \n\n\nThis study showed that a 2.7 um of interphase layer produced a\nmaximum shear bond strength of 38.2 MPa.\n\n\nA thinner layer, and by extrapolation no layer, would lower the\nbond strength.\n\n\nHence, it seems apparent that spinel formation is necessary to 'reaction\nbond' the ceramic / metal junction.\n\n\nWhere the reaction is excessive, however, it will lead to a drop of\nthe bond strength.\n\n\nIt is believed that this is consequential of the thermal residual\nstresses induced by virtue of the differential CTEs at the interphase/metal\njunction during HTP cooling process.\n\n\n5.\n\n\nConclusions All interfacial shear bond strength of 38.2 MPa was\nachieved by hipping nickel powders onto alumina tubing at 1200@C, 200MPa and\n100 min soaking time.\n\n\nThis produced a reaction layer of the nickel aluminate spinel\nmeasuring 2.7 m.\n\n\nIn all instances, NiAI204 nickel aluminate spinel was observed at\nNi/AI203 interface, indicating that the oxygen level is higher than the\nthreshold oxygen activity level.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '57e383f3-38f7-4daf-a889-ef961479aaf1', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.737966+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9403732419013977, 'non_english_score': 0.059626758098602295}
{'text': 'Profile \n\n\nGoh Chok Tong was born in Singapore on May 20, 1941.\n\n\nLife was not a bed of roses for the young Goh, the eldest of five\nchildren.\n\n\nTheir father died when Goh was nine years old, leaving their mother, a\nChinese school teacher, now in her 70s, to fend for them.\n\n\nWith his mother at work, the children were left to be raised mostly by\ntheir grandmother, an uncle and an aunt.\n\n\nAt one point, in Upper Six, he almost left school to work as a\njournalist because his family needed the money.\n\n\nThe Goh family shared a pre-war house at Pasir Panjang with three or\nfour families.\n\n\nHe had a tiny room to himself.\n\n\n" It was no more than seven or eight feet across.\n\n\nI know because when I slept, I just fitted in," said Goh, who\nmeasures 6 feet 2 inches in height.\n\n\nDr Tan Cheng Bock, MP for Ayer Rajah and Goh\'s schoolmate, recalled\nthat Goh\'s room was extremely spartan, with a kerosene lamp on a table and\nbooks lining the walls, including some Russian novels.\n\n\n" Everyone else in those days was reading comics, and there he was\nreading such serious, difficult books," said Dr Tan.\n\n\nGoh attended Raffles Institution, the same English-medium premier\nschool that Lee Kuan Yew went to.\n\n\nA teacher remembered him as " a well-behaved and disciplined youth,\nwell-liked by his teachers.\n\n\nAt the early age of 14, he already showed leadership qualities".\n\n\nGoh was a troop leader of the Boy Scouts, vice-head prefect, editor\nof the school magazine and captain of the school\'s swimming team.\n\n\nPhilip Liau, a former teacher, described Goh as respectful and " an\nupright, honest, decent sort of boy".\n\n\nEugene Wijeysingha, Principal of Raffles Institution and Goh\'s\nteacher then, said: " As a school prefect, in the swimming team, in every\nassignment he was given, he took them all very seriously.\n\n\nHe was organised and fair and much more mature than the general run\nof the students.\n\n\nOne sort of gets the impression that he was carrying the weight of\nthe world on his shoulder".\n\n\nDr Tan said Goh was shy and a loner.\n\n\n" He only truly relaxed when he was with friends".\n\n\nOn one occasion, Tan said, they were all trying to learn the rock and\nroll but Goh just sat there and laughed at their antics.\n\n\nAcademically, Goh was a late bloomer.\n\n\nDespite his diligence, he did not impress with his secondary school\nperformance.\n\n\nA classmate, now a lawyer, recalled Goh was placed somewhere between\n10th and 20th during his time from 1955 to 1958.\n\n\n" Maybe he concentrated his energies on scouting activities camping,\nhiking and excursions," a teacher quipped.\n\n\nAs a schoolboy, Goh aspired to be a good writer and political\nlimelight was something he never dreamt of.\n\n\nSome of his essays were so well-written that his teacher read them to\nclasses in the upper forms.\n\n\nHe used to write poems, too, some of which appeared in the school\nmagazine.\n\n\nAt that time, anti-colonial sentiments were running high on the\nisland.\n\n\nA schoolmate said: " He was always writing something or other about\nSingapore.\n\n\nWe were all then caught up in the spirit of those times".\n\n\nBut Goh, who won several prizes for his writing, said he was not\nreally caught up in the struggle for independence like his uncle and aunt,\nthough he followed them to rallies.\n\n\nIn 1958, as chairman of the school Historical Society, Goh invited an\nold Rafflesian and a lawyer-politician to give a talk.\n\n\nThe speaker, Lee Kuan Yew, the Opposition Leader then, spoke on "\nLandmarks of Democracy in Malaya".\n\n\nThat was the first time Goh met his future mentor.\n\n\nOn that occasion, Goh said that politics never entered his mind.\n\n\nLittle did he know that 32 years later, he would take over the reins\nof Singapore from that man.\n\n\nGoh proceeded to the University of Singapore on a grant.\n\n\nFor a while, he could not make up his mind whether to read English or\nEconomics.\n\n\nFinally, he opted for Economics " because of the practical streak in\nme".\n\n\nAs it turned out, he made the right choice.\n\n\nIn 1964, he graduated with a first-class honours in Economics.\n\n\nTwo years later, while working in the Singapore Administrative\nService, an elite branch of the civil service, he was awarded a fellowship to\nthe prestigious Williams College in the Northeastern American state of\nMassachusetts.\n\n\nThere, he topped his class and earned a Master of Arts degree in\nDevelopment Economics.\n\n\nGoh is a very private person who does not want to reveal too much\nabout his personal life.\n\n\nOn November 17, 1990, however, he gave a rare insight into how he was\ncoaxed into entering politics.\n\n\nThe occasion was the 20th anniversary dinner of the National Trade\nUnion Congress Income, the insurance arm of Singapore\'s most influential\ntrade union body.\n\n\nAppealing to reluctant Singaporeans to step forward to serve the\nnation, he said: " I am not a natural in politics and I never dreamt of\nbecoming a minister".\n\n\nHis first ambition after graduation was to obtain doctorate and\nbecome a professor.\n\n\nHe enrolled at the University of Singapore and had even picked "\nCapital Formation and Economic Growth" as his research topic.\n\n\nTwo weeks after he started, the Vice-Chancellor informed him that the\ngovernment would not release him from his five-year bond and wanted him to\nreturn and serve as an administrative officer in the Economic Planning Unit.\n\n\nA year later, he applied for a job with Shell.\n\n\nAfter series of tests, including a lunch to observe how he behaved\nsocially, he got the job with a loan to pay up his bond.\n\n\n" So I resigned from the Civil Service, brought forward my marriage\nso that I could go for my honeymoon before starting on the new job and\nhappily went off with my wife to Malaysia".\n\n\nHalfway through his honeymoon, he received a telegram from Shell\nasking him to return as soon as possible.\n\n\nHe thought they needed his service immediately, but it turned out\nthat Dr Goh Keng Swee, the Deputy Prime Minister then, was unhappy that Shell\nwas poaching him and wanted him back at the EPU.\n\n\nShell told him that if he insisted on joining the company, it would\nstill take him on.\n\n\nSensing the predicament of the company, he decided to return to the\nEPU.\n\n\nIn August 1969, he was seconded to the Neptune Oriental Lines,\nSingapore\'s national shipping line, as its Planning and Projects Manager.\n\n\nHe later became its Financial Director and finally, in November,\n1973, its Managing Director.\n\n\n" I was very happy there.\n\n\nI thought I had found my niche in life running a shipping company,"\nGoh said of his stint with the loss-making company which he helped turn\naround within a few short years.\n\n\nThen came the turning point in 1976 when Hon Sui Sen, the Finance\nMinister then, asked him to stand for elections.\n\n\n" I was surprised.\n\n\nI was not a good public speaker.\n\n\nI don\'t speak Malay and I don\'t speak Mandarin.\n\n\nI had no grassroots experience, and had not shown the slightest\ninterest in politics," Goh said.\n\n\nHon persuaded him, saying he was getting old and needed someone to\ntake over from him and that it was important for able young Singaporeans to\nsucceed the older political leaders.\n\n\n" So here I am, a politician, and a shipping director or chairman.\n\n\nMy initial bond to serve the government for five years has become a\nbond for life.\n\n\nBut I have no regrets.\n\n\nIt is very satisfying to be able to contribute my bit to the welfare\nof our nation," he said.\n\n\nGoh was elected Member of Parliament for the Marine Parade\nconstituency in the 1976 General Election.\n\n\nIn the 1980 polls, he was returned unopposed.\n\n\nHe won again in the same ward in the 1984 and 1988 polls, the last as\na member of a three-man team under the new Group Representation Constituency\nelectoral scheme.\n\n\nA year after his maiden electoral victory, Goh gave up his top job in\nthe national shipping company to take up the post of Senior Minister of State\nin he Finance Ministry.\n\n\nIn March 1979, at the age of 38, he presented his first Budget to\nParliament.\n\n\nSoon after that, he became a full Minister in the newly created\nMinister for Trade and Industry.\n\n\nHe assumed the additional portfolio of Health in January 1981 but\ngave up his Trade and Industry portfolio in June the same year to become\nSecond Minister for Defence.\n\n\nAt the beginning of June 1982, he was appointed Defence Minister, a\npost he still holds today.\n\n\nTo help complete the implementation of the Medisave health scheme\nwhich he initiated, he retained his presence in the Health Ministry as its\nSecond Minister.\n\n\nThe multi-role exposure and the increasingly important duties he\nassumed clearly pointed to bigger things to come his way.\n\n\nThe December 1984 General Election was a watershed in Goh\'s political\ncareer.\n\n\nIn an unprecedented setback, the PAP lost two of the 79 seats, along\nwith a 12.6 percentage-point drop in its popular vote.\n\n\nThe signal from the voters, particularly the younger ones, was clear:\nthey want a more open and less paternalistic government.\n\n\nBeing more attuned to the changing mood of the electorate, Goh easily\nwon the approval of his peers with his consultative style of leadership.\n\n\nAt a private meeting several days after the General Election, the\nyounger-generation PAP core-group ministers unanimously picked Goh as their\nleader.\n\n\nParliament Speaker Tan Soo Khoon said: " He was elected by the\nyounger-generation because they felt his style was appropriate to the\nchanging times.\n\n\nHis style of listening to people, of considering other people\'s\nviews, suits today\'s generation which likes to be heard".\n\n\nGoh was named First Deputy Prime Minister in a Cabinet reshuffle on\nDecember 31, 1984.\n\n\nIn that capacity, he was implicitly the heir-apparent to succeed PM\nLee.\n\n\nThe home stretch of Goh\'s ascendancy to premiership was, however, not\ncompletely uneventful.\n\n\nFor some time, there was wide speculation that BG Lee, the\nfast-rising star in Singapore politics, might overtake Goh in the "\nsuccession race".\n\n\nAs it turned out, Goh won the final re-endorsement of the younger\nleaders in July 1988 and went on to become the republic\'s second Prime\nMinister on November 28, l990.\n\n\nAt the party level, Goh had a meteoric rise, too.\n\n\nIn 1979, just three years into politics, he became the PAP Second\nAssistant Secretary-General and chief election strategist.\n\n\nSince then, the party has landslide wins in three General Elections\nin 1980, 1984 and 1988.\n\n\nGoh was also instrumental in setting up and running PAP\'s\nsophisticated talent-recruiting system since 1979.\n\n\nHe is now the First Assistant Secretary-General.\n\n\nHe has chosen to remain in the No 2 slot and let the elder Lee\nretain the post of Secretary General " as long as he wishes" in recognition\nof Lee\'s contribution to the party and the nation.\n\n\nOn and off the political arena, praise comes readily for the new\nPrime Minister.\n\n\n" You feel comfortable with him.\n\n\nHe has no airs.\n\n\nHe is a straight-forward man.\n\n\nYou don\'t have to guess at what he is thinking because he will\nalways tell you what\'s on his mind...," said S Puhaindran, a grassroots\nleader in Goh\'s Marine Parade constituency since 1976.\n\n\nSchoolmate Dr.\n\n\nTan Cheng Bock said: " Chok is from a humble background and he cares\nfor the ordinary man".\n\n\nBanker Tan Jee Say, Goh\'s former principal private secretary, said\nhe was approachable, unassuming and unpretentious.\n\n\n" You can walk up to him and talk like a friend".\n\n\n" He is not one of the ultra sensitive types," a civil servant\nobserved.\n\n\n" He\'s able to take fairly strong criticism without going\nimmediately on the defensive.\n\n\nHe\'s quite cool and gracious".\n\n\nA nice guy, yes, but those who know him say it is foolish to\nunderestimate the man.\n\n\n" He\'s no softie," said Dr Tan.\n\n\n" He\'s not so simple.\n\n\nHe makes decision.\n\n\nHe\'s not a man of many words but a man of substance.\n\n\nHe\'s got vision and he\'s got purpose".\n\n\nWhen Goh makes a decision, he will see it to its logical conclusion.\n\n\n\n" Once he has made up his mind, it\'s difficult to make him let go,"\nsaid MP Ow Chin Hock.\n\n\nIn a party that admits only the best talent, Goh is a remarkable\nteam player who is unafraid of being surrounded by able men.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

( London); LL M ( London);\n\n\nof Lincoln\'s Inn, Barrister-at-law;\n\n\nAdvocate & Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore;\n\n\nSenior Lecturer in Law,\n\n\nNational University of Singapore\n\n\nAny married woman, whether Muslim or non-Muslim, is entitled to apply\nunder the Women\'s Charter for reasonable maintenance from her husband for\nherself and their children.\n\n\nChildren include any illegitimate children and any children who have\nbeen accepted by him as a member of the family.\n\n\nA maintenance order may be made before, during and after a divorce.\n\n\nThe Court may order the husband to pay a lump sum or make a monthly\nallowance as maintenance.\n\n\nThe Court will take the following circumstances into account when\nmaking a maintenance order:\n\n\n1) the financial needs of the wife or child/children;\n\n\n2) the income earning capacity, if any, property and other financial\nresources of the wife or child;\n\n\n3) any physical or mental disability of the wife or child; and\n\n\n4) the standard of living enjoyed by the wife before the\nhusband/father neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the\nwife or child.\n\n\n How to make a complaint \n\n\nA complaint is first made to the Magistrate Court.\n\n\nIn the complaint, the wife must state the husband\'s earnings, the\nnumber of dependent children, the amount of maintenance they need and the\ncircumstances under which the husband failed to provide for them.\n\n\nThe Magistrate will order a Summons to be sent to the husband and a\nday will be fixed for a Court hearing.\n\n\nThe Magistrate will make a maintenance order against the husband\nafter hearing all the evidence.\n\n\nBut the husband can always appeal if he thinks the maintenance order\nis unfair.\n\n\nLater, if circumstances change, for instance, the husband earns more,\nand the wife finds the maintenance order is inadequate, either party may\nreturn to Court for a Variation Order.\n\n\nIf the husband fails to make one or more payments, he can be fined or\nimprisoned for each month he is in arrears.\n\n\nIf the husband is in a salaried job, the wife can ask the Court for\nan attachment of earning order.\n\n\nThis is an Order to the husband\'s employer to pay the amount of\nmaintenance to a court officer every month before paying the husband his\nsalary.\n\n\nThe wife then collects the maintenance from this officer every month.\n\n\nWhen an attachment order is in force, the husband must inform the\ncourt when he resigns from his job and when he gets re-employed .\n\n\nWhen making a maintenance order, the Court will try to enable the\nwife and children to enjoy the same lifestyle that the family had been used\nto before the marriage broke down.\n\n\nYou cannot sue for an arrears of maintenance if they have accrued for\nmore than three years before you decided to take legal action.\n\n\n Question 1 \n\n\nI bought a can of drink from a shop near my home.\n\n\nI drank a little and realised that the drink tasted bad.\n\n\nI then poured the contents out of the can into a glass and I found\nsome decomposed worms in the drink.\n\n\nI was ill for a few days.\n\n\nPlease advise me on my legal rights?  Answer: \n\n\nThe manufacturer is responsible for taking all reasonable care to\navoid acts or omissions which he can reasonably foresee would injure his\nneighbour.\n\n\nNeighours are persons so closely and directly affected he should be\nmindful of his acts or omissions.\n\n\nIn your case, the manufacturer of the can of drink owes you a duty of\ncare so you have a right of action against the manufacturer for negligence.\n\n\nAlternatively, you could sue the seller of the can of drink since\nthere was a contract for the sale of the drink between you and the seller.\n\n\nThe ground of action would be breach of merchantable quality under\nthe Sale of Goods Act.\n\n\n Question 2 \n\n\nLast month my neighbour called me a bastard in the midst of an\nargument concerning her pet cat which we were trying to settle.\n\n\nI believe she did it in the heat of the moment.\n\n\nHowever, a few days ago, when my daughter playfully pulled the tail\nof the cat, she shouted, \'Stop it, you daughter of a bastard\'.\n\n\nCan I sue her for slander?\n\n\n Answer: \n\n\nBased on what you said, I do not think that you can take any action\nagainst your neighbour.\n\n\nBut if she persists in being abusive, you should report the matter to\nthe police, who may then be able to warn your neighbour about a breach of the\npeace. \n\n\n\n\n WAYS OF THE LAW SEPARATION AGREEMENTS \n\n\nBy Catherine Tay Swee Kian\n\n\nLL B ( Hons) ( London); LL M ( London); of Lincoln\'s Inn,\n\n\nBarrister-at-law;\n\n\nAdvocate & Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore;\n\n\nSenior Lecturer in Law,\n\n\nNational University of Singapore\n\n\nA separation is an alternative to a divorce.\n\n\nIn a separation, the spouses are free to make binding agreements\nbetween themselves regarding their relationship and how they should, or\nshould not, live together.\n\n\nThere are a number of ways of separating.\n\n\nFirstly, you can make a simple agreement to live apart.\n\n\nOr, you can make a formal agreement, known as a separation deed, to\nlive apart.\n\n\nThirdly, you can have a judicial separation.\n\n\nThe Court can also order the spouses to live apart.\n\n\n\n\n Simple Separation Agreement \n\n\nA couple may simply decide to separate.\n\n\nAn agreement made between the spouses to live apart is not contrary\nto public policy and is valid and will be enforced by the Court.\n\n\n Formal Separation Deed \n\n\nA formal separation deed reduces the likelihood of future argument as\nto what was exactly agreed.\n\n\nA typical separation deed contains provision for the maintenance of\nthe spouse, custody of the children and a mutual covenant, one spouse\nreleasing the other from the marital duty to cohabit.\n\n\nThe deed may also touch on the family assets between the spouses.\n\n\nBut the Court may vary the terms of the deed if it thinks that it is\njust to do so.\n\n\nFrom a woman\'s point of view, it is important that a separation deed\nentitles her to maintenance.\n\n\nShe may presently not need maintenance from her husband.\n\n\nBut she should still protect herself by inserting a nominal sum as\nmaintenance, so that should she need maintenance later, she can ask the Court\nfor an increase.\n\n\nIf there is no maintenance clause, the wife may later find it\ndifficult to persuade the court to order that she be paid maintenance.\n\n\n Judicial Separation \n\n\nThe decree of judicial separation is a very suitable proposition for\nspouses who are unhappy with their marriage but who cannot obtain a divorce\ndue to parental pressure or for religious reasons.\n\n\nWith a decree of judicial separation, the marriage is terminated even\nthough it subsists.\n\n\nIn other words, upon judicial separation, the spouses no longer need\nto cohabit with each other.\n\n\nTo obtain a judicial separation you must prove the same facts as in a\ndivorce petition, such as adultery or desertion.\n\n\nJudicial separation allows you all the rights as in a divorce.\n\n\nBut neither spouse is free to remarry because judicial separation\ndoes not end the marriage in the same way that a divorce does.\n\n\nA judicial separation only ends the spouses\' obligations to live\ntogether.\n\n\nIt also does not prevent the other spouse from getting a divorce if\nshe/he can.\n\n\nIndeed, a judicial separation can be easily converted into a divorce.\n\n\n Court Order \n\n\nA Court will order a couple to live apart when there is a real danger\nof domestic violence to the wife or children.\n\n\nThe court may make an exclusion order whereby the husband is ordered\nout of the matrimonial house, thus leaving the wife and children in peace.\n\n\nThe court may also make a non-molestation protection order, ie\nordering the husband to stop threatening or assaulting the wife and/or\nchildren.\n\n\n Question 1 \n\n\nWhat is the meaning of \'vicarious liability\'?\n\n\nI came across the term in a magazine.\n\n\n\n\n Answer 1 \n\n\nVicarious liability means the responsibility of one person for the\ntorts ( ie wrongful acts) committed by another.\n\n\nTherefore, a principal may be liable for the torts of his agents.\n\n\nLikewise, a master is liable for the torts of his servants.\n\n\n Question 2 \n\n\nLast month, I agreed to sell my computer to a friend.\n\n\nNo price was mentioned in the agreement.\n\n\nAm I bound to sell the computer to her?\n\n\nPlease advise.\n\n\n Answer 2 \n\n\nThe contract is valid and binding even if there was no price\nmentioned, but not so if you can show that negotiations are still going on.\n\n\nWhen the price is not fixed in a contract of sale of goods, the\nbuyer must pay a reasonable price.\n\n\nWhat is a reasonable price depends on the circumstances of each\ncase.\n\n\nIn other words, if the parties are silent on the price but have\nentered into a valid contract, the courts will imply a reasonable price.\n\n\nIn your case, your friend will have to pay you a reasonable price\nfor the computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n WAYS OF THE LAW THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF WOMEN \n\n\nBy Catherine Tay Swee Kian\n\n\nLL B ( Hons.) ( London); LL M ( London)\n\n\nof Lincoln\'s Inn, Barrister-at-law;\n\n\nAdvocate & Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore;\n\n\nSenior Lecturer in Law,\n\n\nNational University of Singapore\n\n\nAs a woman, you can vote and be voted in all elections.\n\n\nYou can hold public office and are entitled to make contracts, sue\nand be sued.\n\n\nYou can enjoy rights to education, employment, any profession or\ncarry on any business alone or in partnership.\n\n\nYou can own or dispose without leaving a will behind.\n\n\nYou can participate in all forms of activities, social, economic or\npolitical.\n\n\nThese rights are not lost upon marriage.\n\n\nThe Women\'s Charter was passed in 1961 to protect the status of\nwomen in Singapore.\n\n\nMonogamous marriage has been practised since then, whereby males are\nnot allowed to have more than one wife.\n\n\nA married woman has the same right as her husband in the running of\nthe home and the caring of the children.\n\n\nBut, if the husband fails to maintain his wife, she can apply to\nCourt for maintenance.\n\n\nIn default, he can be jailed.\n\n\nA married woman may make a will to dispose of her property.\n\n\nIf her husband dies without a will, she is entitled to half of his\nestate.\n\n\nIf her husband leaves all his property to another person, she can\napply under the Inheritance ( Family Provisions) Act for reasonable\nmaintenance, if she is dependent on him.\n\n\nUpon divorce, a wife is entitled to a share of the matrimonial\nproperty even if she did not contribute to the acquisition of the house in\ncash.\n\n\nThe law recognises the non-monetary contributions of a housewife.\n\n\nA battered wife can apply to Court for an injunction to stop her\nhusband from assaulting her or the children.\n\n\nThe court may order the husband to leave the matrimonial home even\nthough he is the owner of the house.\n\n\nIn general, all women have equal rights with men to be protected\nunder the Employment Act.\n\n\nThey are entitled to a safe workplace and, with men, have a right to\nbe protected from mechanical, chemical and other hazards at work.\n\n\nWomen also have equal rights under the Workmen Compensation Act.\n\n\nAll manual workers ( no matter what their earnings) and all\nnon-manual workers earning below\n&dollar;1250 can claim workmen compensation.\n\n\nBut the following are not entitled to workmen compensation:\n\n\n1) casual workers;\n\n\n2) domestic servants;\n\n\n3) non-manual worker earning above\n&dollar;1250; \n\n\n4) police officers;\n\n\n5) outworkers;\n\n\n6) family members of the employer living with the employer; and\n\n\n7) any class of persons declared by the Minister.\n\n\nYou can claim against your former employer under the Workmen\nCompensation Act even if you contracted an occupational disease ( eg\nasbestosis or industrial dermatitis) after you have left their employment.\n\n\n Question \n\n\nSome time in September \' 89 I paid a beautician for a double eyelid\noperation.\n\n\nHer method entails sewing up the upper lids to achieve folds - a\nprocess which she claimed would last ten years. \n\n\nSince July \' 90 ( barely a year later), my left double eyelid has\nstarted disappearing.\n\n\nIt looks terrible because of the extra folds that appear where the\n" sewing" has come loose.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c7c5488b-e98a-429a-b42a-9e926b8f3eda', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.740674+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9667199850082397, 'non_english_score': 0.033280014991760254}
{'text': 'RETROSPECTIVE \n\n\nI was only a child when Singapore had her independence unilaterally\nthrust upon her on August 9, 1965.\n\n\nTherefore, I wasn\'t one of those who mulled over the implications of\nSingapore\'s eviction from Malaysia, succinctly expressed by the bold headline\nof The Straits Times the next morning: " Singapore is Out".\n\n\nHaving absolutely no idea what political forces were at play, I\nneither expected nor noted any radical change to our way of life.\n\n\nTo a child, national concerns were the domain of adults and\nsocio-economic changes, if any, were unobtrusive and took the form of sudden,\nsurprising discoveries.\n\n\nAt some point in time, for instance, I was no longer given any loose\nchange with the cameo of Elizabeth II or George VI.\n\n\nDollar notes from the Lunar New Year ang-pow started to bear orchid\nmotifs.\n\n\nTrips across the Causeway to where my parents\' generation still\naffectionately referred to as " the Federation" became more cumbersome, with\nmandatory stops for passport stamps at artificial barriers called immigration\ncontrols.\n\n\nMy sister, who was schooled in a convent with a high proportion of\nexpatriate children, started to lose friends at a swift, steady pace.\n\n\nI gradually lost sight of the fair-haired Caucasian children laying\non the patios or lawns of the houses and apartments along Dunearn and Bukit\nTimah Roads, which I passed daily on my way to and from school.\n\n\nThere was also talk and frequent sighs, among the older members of my\nfamily, which was in the pineapple canning business, that these were worrying\ntimes for industries that counted on a unified domestic market encompassing\nSingapore and Malaysia.\n\n\nIf I had seen our Prime Minister in his moment of anguish, announcing\nthe collapse of the merger on television, I would not have understood what of\nnational interest could be at stake.\n\n\nThat Singapore\'s role as a financial, banking and shipping centre for\nthe Malaysian peninsula was rescinded, that quotas and retaliatory tariffs\nwere levied as a result of the strained relationship between our country and\nher immediate neighbour, that our very survival as a nation was forecast with\ndoom by the majority of observers on the world stage would have been ideas\nalien to a child\'s perspective.\n\n\nLeft: Countdown to 1990, Singapore\'s Celebration Year, with the Prime\nMinister doing the honours via the magnified image of the Jumbotron at the\nSingapore Indoor Stadium.\n\n\nIt was years later, when I was in a better position to understand the\ntensions of 1965, that I marvelled in retrospect at the vision,\ndetermination, and most of all, courage of our leadership.\n\n\nIt must have been a tall, almost impossible, order to lead a young\nnation devoid of all natural resources, from which the British armed forces (\ntill then our acknowledged protectors) were withdrawing.\n\n\nThe withdrawal of the British forces threatened the precarious basis\nof our national defence, which was then represented by two infantry\nbattalions, one partially mobilized volunteer infantry battalion, a volunteer\nartillery regiment, an armoured car squadron, some engineers and signals, a\nsmall auxiliary air arm and a single patrol boat.\n\n\nOver 25,000 local citizens who worked in the British military bases\nwere faced with unemployment, while the livelihood of thousands more\nconnected with them was also affected.\n\n\nFurthermore, Singapore\'s industrialization programme was just\nunderway, with hordes of young school-leavers joining a labour market which\nwas fraught with strikes and disputes.\n\n\nWhat confronted the leadership at that tumultuous point of transition\nwas a prospect that was daunting and not to be envied by the average person\nwho operated within narrow confines, by and large unconcerned with an\noverview of the state of the nation.\n\n\nThis was especially true in the early days of independence when a\ncollective Singaporean identity remained to be forged, and each man reacted\nin his own way to what directly involved him.\n\n\nFor example, I remember being particularly pleased by curfews as a\nchild.\n\n\nCurfews meant not having to go to school.\n\n\nI little realized the dangers of racial riots in a polyglot,\nmulticultural society aiming towards a secular democracy and communal\nintegration.\n\n\nThe average Singaporean of the mid-1960s had no quarrel with this\nfirst generation of leaders led by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.\n\n\nWhatever support marshalled by the main opposition party, the Barisan\nSocialis, was essentially limited, and dwindled further after it boycotted\nthe elections of April 1968.\n\n\nAfter a time, I no longer noticed election posters with the Barisan "\nring and star" but observed a preponderance of the PAP symbol of a ring\nmounted by lightning, which came to symbolize policies that spelled freedom\nfrom discontent, whether this last was expressed as student agitation or\nlabour disputes.\n\n\n1969 became the first strike-free year after tough new laws were\ncreated to curb labour unrest and establish a climate conducive to\ninvestment.\n\n\nWhile I used to save my pocket money in little piggy banks provided\nby the Chung Khiaw Bank, my parents were soon to open accounts at the\nDevelopment Bank of Singapore, which was established, as I was also to\ndiscover years later, to provide financial assistance for manufacturing\nindustries and take equity in private enterprises in order to get these off\nthe ground.\n\n\nI associated the years following independence with the adjustment to\nnew features about Singapore.\n\n\nThe name Jurong, which hitherto was synonymous with mangrove forests\nin the rural west of the island, became the Jurong Town Corporation.\n\n\nEven though I had not then heard of Dr Albert Winsemius and the\nUnited Nations team who made recommendations for our industrialization\nprogramme after surveying the site, I learnt often enough in school about the\n1,600 hectares of wild swampy land that were filled to accommodate a colony\nof factories.\n\n\nNaval Base, a name which always stood on the northern tip of the\nisland in my primary school atlas, became known as Sembawang Shipyard when\nthe Singapore government inherited all the properties previously occupied by\nthe British military forces, including this comprehensively equipped naval\ndockyard.\n\n\nMeanwhile, our coastline was daily changing as inconsequential\nhillocks were levelled and the soil used to reclaim land from the sea along\nparts of the stretch from Changi to Pasir Panjang.\n\n\nWhile I learnt to accept the fact that I could no longer lean over\nthe parapet at the Esplanade and watch the seawater lap against Queen\nElizabeth Walk, I was also fascinated by the furious pace of construction\nwhich raised high-rise public housing estates at virtually every corner of\nSingapore.\n\n\nSatellite towns were renamed new towns and these in turn developed\ninto towns with their individual character, comprehensive infrastructure of\nsocial amenities and comfortable, lived-in look.\n\n\nWhile the Housing and Development Board was altering the face of\nSingapore\'s residential estates, the Central Business District was assuming a\ndramatic skyline of its own, as hotels and shopping complexes in Orchard Road\ncompeted with office blocks and commercial edifices along Shenton Way for\nuniqueness and originality of design and concept.\n\n\nAlthough some would wax nostalgic over the loss of open-air dining\nopportunities in hawker stalls around Hokkien Street, Chinatown or the\nCuppage Road Car Park, they soon welcomed the cleaner, more orderly and\nhygienic milieux of hawker centres where the same ambience of economy dining\non local morsels is combined with sanitation and vigorously enforced\nstandards in food preparation.\n\n\nThe same applies to the frequent criticisms, during the first decade\nof nationhood, that the finer aspects of our architectural heritage were\nbeing crushed by the relentless bulldozers of urban redevelopment.\n\n\nBut the problem was soon redressed when conservation zones such as\nChinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam were established, and old Georgian\nterraces in the " Golden Shoe" were restored to their former splendour.\n\n\nOne just has to accept the fact that there is a right time for\neverything in Singapore.\n\n\nIn this case, Singapore can afford to preserve her cultural heritage\nafter she has ensured that her economy is stabilized and her home-owning\npopulation ranks among the highest in the world.\n\n\nOn the most banal level, the impact of urban renewal meant for me\nthat flooding along Bukit Timah Road after torrential downpours was\nalleviated by an improved network of drainage canals.\n\n\nAmong my vivid memories of the late 1960s is that of my brother\nreporting for National Service.\n\n\nAfter legislation was passed in 1967 requiring all males at eighteen\nto serve two years with the Singapore Armed Forces as part of a long-term\nplan for national security adopted by the Ministry of Interior and Defence (\nlater Ministry of Defence), my brother was duly recruited.\n\n\nI remember the send-off party to which the family was invited, full\nof anxious-looking parents and fidgety young men unsure of what lay ahead.\n\n\nAlthough my brother often moaned about the discipline and the\nrigorous training, he recognized their positive effects and would eventually\nlook back on those couple of years as character-building ones, when he also\nmade many enduring friendships with people from different races and walks of\nlife.\n\n\nGrowing up in Singapore during her first twenty-five years of\nindependence was also about campaigns.\n\n\nArt classes in school were spent designing posters to disseminate\nvarious messages: " Keep Singapore clean, green and mosquito free", prompted\nby an Environmental Health Act of 1968; " Stop at two", promulgated the\nFamily Planning and Population Board, successor to the voluntary Singapore\nFamily Planning Association of the 1950s; " Use your hands", " Be courteous",\n" Speak Mandarin", to reinforce the importance, respectively, of\nself-sufficiency, civic-consciousness and awareness of ethnic roots.\n\n\nAnd so I learnt to watch Hong Kong television dramas dubbed in\nMandarin, wore " Smiley" badges and held the door for my neighbours.\n\n\nIt has often been said that Singapore is extraordinarily fortunate,\nin having eight years of boom conditions after her independence, when even\nthe American involvement in the Vietnam War boosted her role as a supplies\ncentre, while conflict in the Middle East led to an equal demand for\nship-repair facilities.\n\n\nTo me, such an observation, though historically grounded, smacks of\nsour grapes.\n\n\nFor where does one draw the fine line between a propitious set of\ncircumstances and the foresight and determination to capitalize on it?\n\n\nI echo what our Prime Minister said in his talk at the National\nUniversity of Singapore on 23 July 1990, when I assert that we made happen\nall we have today.\n\n\nIf anything characterizes the resourcefulness of Singapore and her\npeople, it is the flexibility of response accompanied by an accessibility to\nchange.\n\n\nWhen rapprochement occurred between Washington and Moscow, and the\nsubsequent entry of the Peoples\' Republic of China into the United Nations\nled to lesser antipathy between the superpowers, Singapore saw the need for\nregional cooperation between the smaller nations.\n\n\nWhen she decided to exploit the strategic position of her deep-water\nport, Singapore enhanced her shipbuilding and ship-repair facilities, set up\nher own register of local ships, provided tax free registration for foreign\nships, launched a national shipping line, the Neptune Orient Lines, and\ncreated a National Shippers\' Council to shatter the monopoly held by the Far\nEastern Freight Conference, which was till then dominated by old European\nshipping lines.\n\n\nWhen the national birthrate fell below replacement level by the\nmid-1980s, a dire prospect for our nation\'s labour or defence forces in the\nnear future, Singapore started a vigorous campaign to encourage young people\nto marry earlier and have more children, for the purpose of which a special\nSocial Development Unit was set up.\n\n\nThese are but the most obvious examples of our readiness to grasp\nopportunities or effect solutions.\n\n\nFrom the lessons of the past we have learnt to watch our steps, take\nnecessary action and not take too much for granted.\n\n\nThis is again proven by a random survey of our feats during the last\ntwenty-five years.\n\n\nAsian values of piety and fidelity were advocated when economic\nprogress was ineluctably tagged by growing materialism.\n\n\nTax holidays for foreign investors were provided to encourage them to\nset up pioneer industries.\n\n\nRigidly enforced laws against corruption make Singapore a clean\nsociety in both the literal and figurative aspects.\n\n\n" Group representation constituencies" give equal provision to\nminority races and ensure that these are not knowingly undersold or\nneglected. \n\n\nThe list is endless.\n\n\nAnd on this twenty-fifth year, the tangible results of success and\nsocial prosperity are pervasive.\n\n\nWe deserve to be proud.\n\n\nWe have paid our dues and earned our right to celebrate.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'THE NATION-PORT \n\n\nThe story of the port is really the story of Singapore.\n\n\nThe existence of Temasek and the arrival of Stamford Raffles are of\nsuch momentous importance to the history and economic development of\nSingapore that they form part of every child\'s education.\n\n\nEven visitors get to know about it when they come to Singapore.\n\n\nThis familiar tale has been told and retold so many times that the\nrole of the port in the Singapore success story is often taken for granted.\n\n\nThat our nation began and thrived as a port is hardly in dispute.\n\n\nEverybody knows that Singapore had its humble beginnings as a riverine\nport on the banks of the Singapore River.\n\n\nWhat is not so widely known is that the Port of Singapore is now as\nvital - if not more so - to the nation\'s prosperity as it was before.\n\n\nIf the port began as the country\'s ricebowl, it has now evolved to\nscoop up generous helpings of grain as well.\n\n\nWhen it comes to the port, one cannot help but use superlatives.\n\n\nWith 600 ships anchored in the harbour at any one time and one\nleaving the port every seven minutes, Singapore has been the world\'s busiest\nport since 1982.\n\n\nCargo volume has steadily increased and in 1989, the port handled a\nstaggering 173 million tonnes of cargo.\n\n\nThis busy and modern port continues to grow at a frenetic pace,\nregularly chalking up record figures which have turned it into one of the\nworld\'s largest container ports.\n\n\nIn 1989, it reached a new milestone of handling 4.36 million TEUs (\ncontainers calculated in twenty-foot equivalent units).\n\n\nThis works out to 38 containers handled every hour a vessel is\nalongside a berth, with a vessel turning around in 10 hours.\n\n\nThe port is fast expanding its container services: in the second half\nof the 1980s, it has recorded an average container growth rate of 25 per\ncent.\n\n\nIn addition to being the world\'s busiest port in terms of shipping\ntonnage, Singapore remains the top bunkering ( ship refuelling) port in the\nworld, supplying nearly 11 million tonnes of bunkers to vessels every year.\n\n\nThis is a benefit, no doubt, of being also the third largest oil\nrefining centre in the world.\n\n\nBut despite these impressive figures, many Singaporeans still retain\nan image of portworkers as tanned coolies balancing sacks of grain on their\nshoulders, as portrayed in popular paintings of the Singapore River.\n\n\nThis is a perception arrested in time which, hopefully, will be\nupdated by this volume commemorating Singapore\'s silver jubilee.\n\n\nThe commissioning of Tanjong Pagar Terminal ( TPT) in 1972 was an\nimportant milestone for the port.\n\n\nOn its tenth anniversary, TPT handled the magical one millionth TEU\nfrom the mv Neptune Garnet ( left).\n\n\nIt was also in 1982 that Singapore became the world\'s busiest port.\n\n\nPreceding page: This 19th century woodcut records the harsh\nconditions of the earliest coolies.\n\n\nThey worked more than 15 hours a day for meagre wages.\n\n\nToday\'s portworkers are among the most productive in Singapore.\n\n\nAnd their efficiency does not go unrewarded since they are generously\npaid.\n\n\nAfter all, they have to be well-trained and computer-literate to work\nin a high-tech port which makes extensive use of state-of-the-art technology,\nas befits a port serving a nation bent on becoming a City of Excellence in\nthe 21st century.\n\n\nA global port for a global technopolis, this is what the Port of\nSingapore aims to be.\n\n\nSprouting from an initial cluster of dusty godowns on the southern\nseafront, it has evolved to include other sections of the coast as well.\n\n\nIts present 15 kilometres of wharves, taking up seven per cent of the\nisland\'s coastline, make it truly a nation-port.\n\n\nMuch more important than size, though, is the current scale and\ndiversity of port operations.\n\n\nMany Singaporeans think that the port merely handles imports and\nexports, bringing consumer goods into the country and sending off the\nproducts of our industries.\n\n\nHighly efficient and competitive with the best ports in the world,\nthe Port of Singapore is an invaluable national resource.\n\n\nIt functions more like a one-stop shipping and distribution centre\nringed by " distriparks" or zones of modern warehouses sited close to the\nport terminals.\n\n\nAnd with the growing sea-air trade, the world\'s busiest port is\nlinked by fast expressways to Changi, one of the world\'s busiest airports.\n\n\nLooking ahead, the managers are well prepared to take the port into\nthe next century.\n\n\nFrom containers to cruises to maritime conferences, this\nmulti-faceted nation-port is gearing up for exciting new developments such as\nfreight futures, ship management and ship broking services which will enhance\nits role as a premier maritime centre.\n\n\nHence, from a broader perspective, the port and the nation are\ninseparable as future growth in the port will be in tandem with Singapore\'s\ndevelopment as a global economy.\n\n\nJust as Singapore works hard to attract investments of talent and\ntechnology to fuel its dynamism, the port shines like the brightest beacon to\nattract ships.\n\n\nThis held true in the very beginning just as it does today, and it\nwill still hold true in the future.\n\n\nLeft: PSA launch returning to base.\n\n\nFollowing page: Ships docked end to end at Pasir Panjang Terminal.\n\n\n DARK SEAS, BRIGHT LIGHTS \n\n\nIt is a clear, moonlit night, and the stars beckon to the traveller.\n\n\nThe mv ( motor vessel) Eastern Highway slices smoothly through a\nslightly choppy South China Sea towards her destination.\n\n\nThe crew on deck are eager to reach shore, but for the moment, they\nare just enjoying the serenity of the night.\n\n\nWeeks earlier, the 153-metre multi-deck car carrier collected a\nconsignment of new Japanese cars before setting sail from Hiroshima.\n\n\nUnknown to the car carrier, another vessel is steaming several\nnautical miles in her wake in the darkness.\n\n\nHeaded in the same direction, the mv Audinet is coming from the Gulf\nof Thailand, after having lifted anchor at Bangkok.\n\n\nAt about the same time, but a peninsula away, the mv Neptune Garnet\nis travelling effortlessly along one of the busiest shipping channels in the\nworld.\n\n\nThe Strait of Malacca is calm except for occasional swells as the sea\nheaves its bosom and shimmers in the moonlight.\n\n\nIt is a perfect night for star-gazing, an activity which mariners of\nyore had to undertake in order to check sailing directions.\n\n\nBut now on the brightly-lit bridge of this container ship, Captain\nParvez confirms that she is on course as scheduled with a reading of the\nship\'s compass.\n\n\nIt has been a long haul for the master and crew and they will be glad\nfor a well-earned rest soon enough.\n\n\nSuez has been the Neptune Garnet\'s last port of call; the container\nship has then voyaged through the Arabian Sea, across the vast expanse of the\nIndian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.\n\n\nSuch a passage across the open seas was not undertaken by the mv\nEquator, a coaster better suited to transporting cargo in bags and crates\nfrom port to port in the region.\n\n\nSailing from almost the opposite direction, from Sipitang in Sabah,\nshe will soon be docking to pick up her next shipment of consumer goods.\n\n\nUnsighted by the Equator is the mv Roda Perkasa, which at the moment\nappears only as a tiny speck of light in the faraway distance.\n\n\nThe bulk carrier is a bigger vessel which started her journey at\nTanjong Priok, near Jarkarta.\n\n\nLiterally in the dark, from different points of the compass, all five\nships are being drawn as if by a giant invisible magnet towards the world\'s\nbusiest port.\n\n\nFrom the north steams the Audinet with a combination of containerised\ncargo and crated rubber and textiles; from the south, the Roda Perkasa is\nferrying cement clinker from Indonesia; from the east, the coaster Equator is\nladen with local produce, mainly cocoa beans and pepper; from the northeast\nchugs the Eastern Highway like a seaborne carpark with her decks of\nmotor-cars.\n\n\nFinally the Neptune Garnet, the biggest of the five vessels, is\napproaching from the northwest with sealed containers carrying goods which\nrange from machinery to foodstuffs.\n\n\nAbove: This l9th century woodcut depicts coaling activity at night.\n\n\nThe coolies worked in pairs, hauling 160 lb bags of coal on their\nbare shoulders.\n\n\nLeft: Quay cranes at TPT operate round the clock.\n\n\nPreceding page: The mv Maritime Hibiscus at Jurong Wharves, where\nbulk cargo is handled.\n\n\nAs the five ships converge steadily on Singapore, the majority of the\npopulation slumbers on, blissfully unaware of the night visitors or that\nanother 100 ships will arrive in our waters before daybreak.\n\n\nNor are they aware that more than 38,000 ships from over 700 shipping\nlines visit our nation-port every year.\n\n\nOn board the ships, however, crew members are most aware of the next\nstopover in Singapore, which some historians believe got its name from the\n19th century usage of " singgah" and " pura", meaning " the city where one\nbreaks one\'s journey".\n\n\nIn anticipation, some even go on deck to scan the horizon.\n\n\nTo ships on the open sea, Singapore is very brightly lit at night, a\nwelcome beacon that can be detected by weary travellers even beyond the\ndistant horizon.\n\n\nFrom as far out as 15 nautical miles, you can see the glow of the\ncity at night.\n\n\nAbout 10 nautical miles away, the lights of tall buildings,\nespecially those on the east coast, are visible.\n\n\nIn fact, making a good first-time impression with a royal visitor was\nhow Singapore got its name.\n\n\nAccording to the Sejarah Melayu ( Malay Annals), the title " Lion\nCity" was inspired by a legendary encounter between a Sumatran prince and the\nnoble beast on our sandy shores.\n\n\nLike all vessels travelling into Singapore waters, these five ships\nwill dock at one of the five modern wharves or terminals, as they are now\ncalled.\n\n\nTanjong Pagar Terminal handles containerised cargo such as computers\nand garments.\n\n\nGeneral cargo, such as local produce and foodstuff, is loaded and\nunloaded at both Keppel and Pasir Panjang, the latter specializing also in\ncoastal cargo.\n\n\nJurong is the port of call for ships transporting dry bulk cargo, for\ninstance cement and grain.\n\n\nCars come into the country at Sembawang, which also handles other\nhigh volume cargo, such as timber for example.\n\n\nAnd at the berth, each vessel is guaranteed a fast, efficient\nround-the-clock service so that she can be turned around and be on her way as\nsoon as possible.\n\n\nTime, as they say, is money and the Port of Singapore Authority (\nPSA) has perfected the art of satisfying its customers to an exact science.\n\n\nThere is no other way to describe the non-stop buzz of computers,\nhigh-tech machines and the talented, trained staff who run the system like\nclockwork, or the zeal applied to employee productivity as measured by "\nturnround time" or " number of containers handled per vessel hour".\n\n\nLeft: Cranes waiting to unload containers from the mv Luna Maersk\nwhich plies the Far East-Europe route.\n\n\nCentre: Feeder ship mv Susak of the Bengal Tiger Line connects\nSingapore with India.\n\n\nRight: Discharging containers from the mv Ever Valor.\n\n\nThe master of the Neptune Garnet knows that everything has been\nmeticulously planned down to the very last detail long before his ship\nbreaches the port limits.\n\n\nEverything actually began five days ago when the ship owners, Neptune\nOrient Lines, applied for a berth at Tanjong Pagar Terminal through PORTNET,\na computer network set up by the PSA to cut down paper transactions and\nstreamline its operations.\n\n\nWithin hours, the schedule for the container yard crane was drawn up.\n\n\nSpace was allocated for containers destined for the Neptune Garnet.\n\n\nOver the next two days, all the documentation was completed; the\nexport containers were stuffed at the container freight station and\ntranshipment containers from other ships were positioned in the yard to speed\nup the loading on board the vessel.\n\n\nThe computerized Berth Allocation System has also automatically\ntriggered off orders for pilots and tugboats to be assigned to the vessel.\n\n\nHence, as the Neptune Garnet steams smoothly through the Phillip\nChannel in the early morning hours, Master Parvez is waiting on the bridge,\nready to receive the PSA pilot, Mr TK Tay, at the Eastern Boarding Ground.\n\n\n\nHis job is to guide the vessel into port.\n\n\nThe first thing Mr Tay does as he comes on board is to check the\ncondition of the ship and discuss the berthing manoeuvres with the master.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'Chapter One \n\n\nOn a grey, miserable December afternoon, a man and his wife alighted\nfrom a taxi in Clemenceau Avenue.\n\n\nThe man carried two tattered nylon suitcases.\n\n\nHe was thin, narrow-shouldered and not more than 1.73 metres tall.\n\n\nHis face was bony and lean-jawed.\n\n\nHeavy black eyebrows met in a V over a high-bridged fleshy nose that\nhad obviously been battered many times before.\n\n\nHis eyes were guarded and his lips, strange in such a hard face, were\nas red and as shapely as a woman\'s.\n\n\nThe blue shirt he had on was frayed at the collar and stained a dirty\nbrown with sweat.\n\n\nThe trousers hung loose.\n\n\nThe man did not look happy.\n\n\nThe girl was pretty and young.\n\n\nShe had taken great care with her make-up.\n\n\nBlack kohl smudged her eyes and made them bigger than they already\nwere.\n\n\nPink blusher swept her high cheek-bones and her lips gleamed with\nrosy gloss.\n\n\nA gold choker glimmered on her fair neck and gold anklets both\nankles.\n\n\nShe was almost as tall as the man, and very slim.\n\n\nBut she moved slowly, almost languorously, as though carrying a\nsecret weight.\n\n\nThe man leaned protectively towards her.\n\n\nThey had been married only a month.\n\n\nHis name was Shahid Hussain Soomro.\n\n\nHe was 35-years-old but looked at least ten years older.\n\n\nHis wife was known as Saminah, and she was 22.\n\n\nThey were both from Pakistan.\n\n\nThe time was 4 pm and the day, December 17, 1990, a Monday eight days\nbefore Christmas.\n\n\nJust a stone\'s throw away, Orchard Road was teeming with frazzled\nshoppers trying to beat the Christmas deadline.\n\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were the rage that year and on every\nchild\'s Christmas list.\n\n\nMuch to the delight of store managers, parents were fast clearing the\nshelves of those monstrous green plastic half-man-half-turtle toys.\n\n\nCash registers were merrily ringing in the festive season.\n\n\nThere was much less activity in Clemenceau Avenue, a narrow, winding\nstretch of road named after M Georges Clemenceau, the French premier during\nWorld War One, who visited Singapore in the 1920s.\n\n\nOnly a handful of cars were cruising past at that time of day, the\nrush-hour traffic jams being an hour or so away.\n\n\nA yellow-and-black taxi stuck close to the kerb, waiting to pick up\npassengers.\n\n\nThere were none around.\n\n\nThe couple stood in front of a block of private apartments called Sky\nVilla.\n\n\nIt was an incongruously glamourous name.\n\n\nThe facade of the building was squat, sleepy and ugly.\n\n\nLaundry hung untidily from the back balconies of the white and blue\nflats, and an assortment of brooms, mops and featherdusters were displayed\nfor all to see.\n\n\nSky Villa was also considerably dwarfed by the svelte\nconcrete-and-glass structures that had sprung up around it in recent years.\n\n\nThe Pakistanis collected their breath.\n\n\nThey had done a lot of walking that day and their feet were aching.\n\n\nWith a sigh, Shahid heaved up the bags and they headed for the\napartments.\n\n\nThey took a stuffy lift to the third floor.\n\n\nThey had been advised to try their luck there.\n\n\nA room might just be available.\n\n\nYusof Mon, a stocky 68-year-old Malay caretaker with the thick\nshoulders and careless gait of a seaman, was reading the newspaper when he\nheard the knock on his door.\n\n\nHe opened it and peered at the couple through blue-rimmed\ncataract-stricken eyes.\n\n\nForeigners, he saw at once.\n\n\nDown-and-out too.\n\n\nThe man was shabbily dressed.\n\n\nHis face was drawn and bleak.\n\n\nThe girl, he noted, had dark crescents under her eyes despite her\nthick make-up.\n\n\n" Hello, got room here?" Shahid\'s English was heavily-accented.\n\n\nHe spoke hesitantly, as if he didn\'t dare place too much hope on the\nquestion and dreaded the answer.\n\n\n" Yes." Yusof Mon watched over three furnished apartments.\n\n\nThey were free of boarders at the moment.\n\n\n" How much?\n\n\nWe come from Pakistan.\n\n\nWe don\'t have much money.\n\n\nWe go to hotel, but too expensive".\n\n\nShahid\'s words came out in a rush and his face looked hopeful.\n\n\n" Forty dollars one day," Yusof Mon replied.\n\n\nHe could see that they were exhausted.\n\n\nThe man, especially, looked like he could lie down anywhere, for\nweek.\n\n\nShahid screwed his eyes and appeared to make some mental\ncalculations.\n\n\nThen he nodded.\n\n\n" Okay.\n\n\nWe take it.\n\n\nWe stay a few days".\n\n\nThe caretaker led them across the hall to an empty apartment.\n\n\nThe couple was shown into a small dismal bedroom.\n\n\nIt was sparsely furnished - just a single bed and a wardrobe.\n\n\nA coat of dust covered the bare concrete floor and the curtain hung\nlimply at the window.\n\n\nIt had once been white, but was now a dirty shade of grey.\n\n\nThe Pakistanis didn\'t seem to notice their less than salubrious\nsurroundings.\n\n\nThey were just relieved at finally finding a room.\n\n\nYusof Mon left them and went back to his newspaper.\n\n\nThin slats of weak sunlight wavered through the window sills.\n\n\nThe murmur of cleaning women gossiping below the apartment drifted up\nto the room.\n\n\nFar off there were the creaks and groans of machines working on\nSingapore\'s first underground road tunnel in the Central Expressway.\n\n\nThe sounds reminded Shahid of the screech of wild birds - beady-eyed\nravens, or vultures encircling their prey.\n\n\nSaminah unpacked.\n\n\nThey had left in a hurry and had brought little with them.\n\n\nThe clothes in the suitcases belonged mostly to her -

a thing of the past.\n\n\nNo one would come after him.\n\n\nHe would not be hanged after all.\n\n\n Chapter Two \n\n\nIn his years as a caretaker, Yusof Mon had made friends with many of\nthe tourists who rented the rooms he kept watch over.\n\n\nMost of them were hippy-like European travellers on a shoestring\nbudget who couldn\'t afford the rates hotels charged, but wanted a place in\nthe city.\n\n\nThe old man had fond memories of these cheerful young people, and\nkept photographs of himself posing with them in his wallet.\n\n\nHe took out the pictures whenever he was bored or lonely, and often\nwondered how they were doing back home.\n\n\nBut he sensed that the Pakistani couple was different from the other\ntourists.\n\n\nShahid tried to make conversation once or twice.\n\n\nBut the Pakistani seemed too withdrawn for someone on a holiday.\n\n\nHe hardly smiled, let alone laughed.\n\n\nHe had a preoccupied look on his face, as if something was troubling\nhim.\n\n\nSaminah also kept to herself, and didn\'t even go shopping like most\nfemale tourists.\n\n\nSo it was no loss to the caretaker when, three days later, on\nDecember 20, the couple moved out of the apartment after paying the rent.\n\n\nYusof Mon went about his business.\n\n\nHe checked the rooms, read the newspaper and, within a day, had\nforgotten about the strange Pakistani and his young wife.\n\n\nOn the morning of December 24, the old man went back to his own home\nin Jalan Teck Whye to spend the Christmas holiday with his family.\n\n\nHe was pottering about in his singlet when, at noon, he heard the\ndoorbell ring.\n\n\n" Please, can you help us?\n\n\nWe have no money, we have no place to go.\n\n\nCan we stay with you for a while?" Shahid was at the door with\nSaminah.\n\n\nTheir two travelling bags were on the floor.\n\n\nThye looked grubby and weary.\n\n\nThe girl\'s make-up was smudged.\n\n\nShe had been crying.\n\n\nYusof Mon was shocked.\n\n\nFor a moment, he couldn\'t even place them.\n\n\nWhen he finally realised who they were, he wondered: How did they\nknow where he lived?\n\n\nDid he give Shahid his address?\n\n\nWell, yes, maybe he did during one of their short conversations.\n\n\nBut never did he think the man would remember it, let alone seek him\nout and ask for help.\n\n\n" How can I help?\n\n\nI have no money, I have no room.\n\n\nI cannot do anything for you".\n\n\nThe old man knew he was being hard-hearted.\n\n\nBut what else could he do, he told himself.\n\n\nHe couldn\'t just let strangers into his house, even if he had room\nfor them to stay.\n\n\nHe had read many newspaper stories about how people got robbed and\neven killed for being too trusting.\n\n\nShahid pleaded.\n\n\nHe was only temporarily out of money, he said, and would soon\nreceive a large sum from Pakistan.\n\n\nHis family members were important people with political connections\nand they would help him.\n\n\nHe needed shelter for just one week.\n\n\nThen he was going to Australia.\n\n\nHe could not afford the\n&dollar;40 he paid for the Sky Villa room.\n\n\nHe had tried so many other places.\n\n\nHe was only turning to the old man as a last measure.\n\n\nYusof Mon was the only person he knew in Singapore.\n\n\nEveryone else were strangers.\n\n\n" Please help a fellow Muslim," he begged.\n\n\nAnd, he revealed, Saminah was pregnant.\n\n\nThe girl sniffed when her name was mentioned and looked as if she\nwas going to start crying.\n\n\nShahid was a smooth talker.\n\n\nYusof Mon yielded.\n\n\n" I have no room here," he repeated.\n\n\n" But maybe my daughter can help you.\n\n\nCome in first".\n\n\nThe couple stepped inside gratefully.\n\n\nSurani binte Yilsof, 31, was at her flat in Bukit Panjang when her\nfather called.\n\n\n" Two fellas here from Pakistan got problem.\n\n\nMoney problem and wife also pregnant.\n\n\nThey say want to borrow one room.\n\n\nThey say want to stay here with me.\n\n\nHow can?\n\n\nYou want to lend your room?" he asked.\n\n\n" I\'ll go there now," Surani said immediately.\n\n\nA plump, pleasant-faced mother of two boys, she was a practical sort\nof person who did not believe in procrastination.\n\n\nIt was better to sweep away problems as they came, she always\nthought.\n\n\nher husband, Salim, sold satay at a stall in Telok Blangah, but it\nwas she who made all his business decisions.\n\n\nWhen she arrived, the Pakistanis were seated in the hall.\n\n\nTwo glasses of 7-Up and a plate of butter cake were on the table in\nfront of them.\n\n\nThe couple looked shy, even ill at ease. \n\n\nSurani was an optimist and liked to see the best in things.\n\n\nShahid, she concluded at once, had a decent face.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '30f7824a-9a1c-4ba2-80d3-e5a23af6ac64', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.744120+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9952570199966431, 'non_english_score': 0.004742980003356934}
{'text': 'arts on campus Vol 1, Issue 4, March 1992 ISSN 0218-2343\n\n\n( New Directions)  NUS Theatre - Archives and Publications \n\n\nBy Audrey Wong\n\n\nThere is more to promoting theatre than simply mounting dance, drama\nand music performances.\n\n\nAfter a year of existence, NUS Theatre is spreading its wings and\nembarking on two new projects, bringing to a higher level its objective of\npromoting awareness and understanding of the arts in Singapore.\n\n\nThe two projects, which are already in motion, are the setting up of a\npublications wing and an archive for the arts.\n\n\nCome April, the first book to be published by NUS Theatre will make\nits appearance in the market: the play Single by Moh Hon Meng will launch the\nTheatre\'s Singapore Play Series.\n\n\nFollowing on its heels will be Three Children by Malaysian playwright\nLeow Puay Tin.\n\n\nThis will be the first in the Southeast Asia Play Series.\n\n\nThe ultimate aim is to foster growth in the arts scene, by raising an\nawareness that the arts are not just extra-curricular activities, one-off\nperformances or socially prestigious events, but are living, breathing forms.\n\n\nPublishing plays is only the beginning.\n\n\nEventually, NUS Theatre hopes to put out other works on culture and\nthe arts, including academic and critical studies.\n\n\nAnd while the first publications are in English, it is hoped that\nworks in other languages will also make their appearance in the future.\n\n\nThe Chairman of NUS Theatre Working Committee, Dr Tong Chee Kiong,\nsaid: " The point of this is to increase public awareness.\n\n\nWe want to make these works easily available and to provide an\nopportunity for people to publish works which have not found a market yet".\n\n\nThe ultimate aim is to foster growth in the arts scene, by raising an\nawareness that the arts are not just extra-curricular activities, one-off\nperformances or socially prestigious events, but are living, breathing forms.\n\n\nThe audience, Dr Tong continued, must eventually have an appreciation\nof a performance or work based on a real understanding of its meaning and its\nforms.\n\n\nThis appreciation can only be generated through analytical, critical\nand theoretical awareness of the arts, a more rigorous way of viewing and\nunderstanding them.\n\n\nAnd as NUS Theatre is unique among cultural organisations in that it\nhas for its base an academic institution, it is in a good position to start\nlooking at Singapore arts in such ways, as an academic endeavour.\n\n\nThis kind of endeavour, in addition to the improvement of standards\nin performance and the training of artists and administrators, is crucial for\nkeeping the arts alive and relevant.\n\n\nDr Tong pointed out that the arts scene in some other countries such\nas the United States is vibrant precisely because practitioners and\nacademicians have detailed, critical and analytical knowledge.\n\n\nThis view of the arts would also affect the audience.\n\n\nThe publications wing will continue to publish Arts in Campus, with a\nview to making it a lively, viable forum on the arts in Singapore, involving\nmuch of the national arena.\n\n\nThe newsletter has, in fact, grown from its beginnings to become a\nlink between the arts activities on and off campus.\n\n\nVarious cultural groups have offered to collaborate on the\npublication, while sponsorship has been pledged as well.\n\n\nFeedback has been good too, Dr Tong said.\n\n\nHe recalled a comment by a reader that Arts on Campus is an\nalternative avenue to The Straits Times for news and views on the arts.\n\n\nThe second major project, the setting up of an arts archive, is also\nin line with NUS Theatre\'s objectives of looking at the arts in a more\nacademic way and raising public awareness.\n\n\nThe archive will collect artifacts, scripts, videotapes of\nperformances, photographs and other things associated with arts activities,\nin particular the traditional art forms, both within Singapore and in the\nSoutheast Asia region.\n\n\nNUS Theatre hopes to collect artifacts in an broad a multi-media\narena as possible, and showing as much of the character of the art forms as\npossible, including collecting playwrights\' notes, copies of scripts with\nscribblings, and so on.\n\n\n" It is necessary to document what is now available in Singapore and\nthe region, as many of the traditional art forms, given the modern systems we\nlive in, are in a state of decline," Dr Tong said.\n\n\nIf an art form should disappear, and future generations wish to\nrevive it, the archive would give them the means to do so.\n\n\nIt would also be a research resource for those who want to study and\nunderstand the art forms and cultural practices of the region.\n\n\nNUS Theatre has already started working with various organisations on\nthis project, and has requested for materials from artists and groups in\nSingapore and the region.\n\n\nThey are also looking for plays to publish, thus developing a corpus\nof Singapore plays, so that these will not be forgotten after they have been\nperformed.\n\n\nNUS Theatre hopes that as these projects get off the ground, more\nfunding and sponsorship will also be given.\n\n\n" We\'re not in this for the money.\n\n\nIn fact, we know that we will lose money," Dr Tong commented\nrealistically.\n\n\n" But the point is projecting the arts onto public consciousness".\n\n\n 1,2,6 - Ready To Go \n\n\nBy Audrey Wong\n\n\n( New Directions)\n\n\nYet another performing arts centre?\n\n\nYes, after such centres as Telok Ayer, Stamford and The Substation,\nthere is still room for more.\n\n\nBut the five groups to be housed in the new centre at Cairnhill Road\n- called " One-Two-Six" - which is expected to operate in June 1992, want it\nto be more than just a base or a rehearsal space.\n\n\nThey hope to turn it into a true arts hub, with frequent activities,\nincluding joint projects; a place where the public can drop in and watch the\nartistic process.\n\n\nThe five groups - Act 3, The Necessary Stage, Perkumpulan Seni,\nTeater Kami and Cecilia Hon\'s Ballet Theatre - aim to work closely to achieve\ntheir dream for more artistic collaboration.\n\n\nThey plan to hold an annual joint event, perhaps a Theatre Fair,\nwhile at other times of the year, the groups can feed off one another\nartistically.\n\n\nAct 3, for instance, is now working with Cecilia Hon in preparation\nfor a future production.\n\n\nWhen the groups are housed in the same building, it will be much\neasier for such collaboration to take place, as the people would not need to\ntravel from place to place to rehearse, and there can be more communication\nbetween groups.\n\n\n" There will be co-ordination between the groups," said Ruby Lim Yang\nof Act 3.\n\n\n" When one group is doing something, another may be having a lull,\nbut the liveliness will always be there".\n\n\nAlvin Tan, president of The Necessary Stage, hope One-Two-Six can be\na place where the public can drop in at any time.\n\n\nOne-Two-Six will be a lively cross between The Substation, as it\nwere, with its programmes involving the public, the other centres, which\noperate mainly as rehearsal space and meeting rooms for their tenants.\n\n\nAlvin is, however worried that its distance from the main road may be\na hindrance.\n\n\nHe said: " At present, there is no place for staging cultural events\nin the Orchard Road area, unlike Shenton Way.\n\n\nWe hope we can have lunchtime performances in One-Two-Six, but there\nmay be a problem getting an audience".\n\n\nStill, he hopes that the public will come once word gets around.\n\n\nThere will be at least one performance area at One-Two-Six, at Act 3.\n\n\nThe Necessary Stage hopes to turn two adjoining rehearsal rooms into\na " large open space: for performances and play-readings as well.\n\n\nFor all the groups, the new premises mean that they hold more\nactivities-workshops, exhibitions, performances - and to have these\nactivities on a larger scale.\n\n\nFor Teater Kami and Perkumpulan Seni, in particular, the move is\nsignificant as they do not have a fixed base to rehearse in or operate from\nat the moment.\n\n\nRoslan Badron, co-ordinator of Teater Kami, said: " We feel very\nexcited.\n\n\nWith this base, we hope in a few years to go fulltime".\n\n\nAlso, he said, the group can now put up more productions every year,\nadding: " It will be a new experience for us.\n\n\nWith One-Two-Six, we can exchange ideas, stagecraft, experiences.\n\n\nWe can learn much".\n\n\nEncik Abdul Ghani Hamid, vice-president of Perkiumpulan Seni, said\nthat his group has interests in drama, music, art and literature, but its\nactivities have been limited by its lack of space.\n\n\nThey plan to hold drama and writing workshops, as well as art\nclasses.\n\n\n" And why not make use of the walls as well, to hold art\nexhibitions?" he added.\n\n\n" A lot of young artists need space to show their works, the museum\nis always all booked up, and art galleries have many conditions for artists\nwho want to exhibit their works".\n\n\nArt exhibitions are also part of The Necessary Stage\'s plans, besides\nstarting a playwrights\' programme, reading-cum-improvisation sessions with\ndirectors and writers to develop plays, and the creation of a repertory\ntheatre.\n\n\nThere is also the idea of mounting art/photographic exhibitions\ntogether with plays or readings, dealing with a particular theme.\n\n\nFor this, The Necessary Stage plans to approach other groups and\nartists to work with.\n\n\nFor Act 3, the new premises are a natural next step in their\ndevelopment, which is to work the theatre company to its maximum.\n\n\nWith more space, quantity and quality can be improved.\n\n\nAlthough Act 3 is grateful for its current headquarters, which was\nset up with the help of the Ministry of Community Development, the place is\nstill a little too cramped to accommodate a theatrical space, an office, a\nworkshop, and a costume rental department.\n\n\nWith One-Two-Six, their current base will be turned into a theatre\ndesigned to accommodate their young patrons, while the reat of the office\nwill move into the adjoining building, the main part of One-Two-Six.\n\n\nThe groups are pleased with the nominal rent at One-Two-Six.\n\n\nIt would mean freeing funds for more artistic development.\n\n\nCecilia Hon\'s Ballet Theatre, for instance, has had to rent rehearsal\nrooms for its classes, at the Drama centre and The Substation, since it moved\nout of its former premises at Paradiz Centre.\n\n\nMiss Hon said that it is not always easy to book the Drama Centre\nrehearsal rooms, which cost her\n&dollar;40 for four hours.\n\n\n" With the new place, we can have many activities.\n\n\nWe can hold our exams there, and have ballet, tap, jazz and exercise\nclasses.\n\n\nIt can be used for rehearsals for our performances too," she said.\n\n\nAnother economy of scale that can be achieved is in terms of\npublicity.\n\n\nEach group, in mentioning " One-Two-Six" in its publicity, can\ngenerate a higher profile for its fellow tenants as well.\n\n\nWith joint activities which may even include fundraising, every group\nstands to gain in terms of public awareness.\n\n\nThe groups talk of their current " administrative synergy" turning\ninto " artistic synergy".\n\n\nOne-Two-Six, they hope, will have a special spirit, but with each\ngroup retaining its own identity.\n\n\nA positive aspect of their outlook is that they are open to other\ngroups using the facilities and working together with them.\n\n\n" The arts community is very small," said Ruby Lim Yang.\n\n\n" We hope there will be more arts hubs in Singapore.\n\n\nIt is never enough to say " Oh, there\'s The Substation, there\'s Telok\nAyer.\n\n\nThe arts must spread, like mushrooms".\n\n\n Chow Yun Fat heralds new Asian face in film \n\n\nby Koh Buck Song\n\n\nHong Kong actor Chow Yun Fat looks like he will make a lasting impact\nin America.\n\n\nPerhaps not right now, but soon.\n\n\nHis Hollywood debut movie, The Replacement Killers, seems unlikely\nto be an immediate blast.\n\n\nAt under 1 1/2 hours, it is too short and gives Chow too few lines to\nextend his range as a dramatic actor.\n\n\nBut his achievement in getting so far, with the promise of two more\nmovies on the way, will certainly help give Asian culture the world attention\nit has lacked so far.\n\n\nThe action film, which opened here two Thursdays ago and also stars\nMira Sorvino ( of Mighty Aphrodite fame), has some elements that should make\nit stand out. \n\n\nThe slow-motion action sequences, inspired by Hollywood director\nJohn Woo, belong in a string of movies in the mould of Woo\'s recent hit,\nFace/Off, starring Nicolas Cage and John Travolta.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5a07ab41-a558-421f-96bb-de7231dc88ea', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.745537+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9743679761886597,

{'text': 'The Family Man \n\n\nI loved to hear my father recount how he met my mother.\n\n\nIt was one of the rare times that my mother would really blush!\n\n\nThey were introduced to each other by N I Low and his wife.\n\n\nThe Lows, being Foochow, easily won the confidence of my mother, who\ncame from the Foochow settlement of Sibu in Sarawak.\n\n\nEthel, the Low\'s vivacious daughter, studied the violin with my\nfather.\n\n\nShe was a very talented student and my father taught her at the Low\nresidence in Lowland Road.\n\n\nMy father first met my mother when he went to give Ethel a lesson.\n\n\nHe was struck by her beauty, but felt thwarted by her seeming\nreticence in conversation.\n\n\nHe mentioned to the Lows that it was so difficult to communicate with\nMiss Chang as she would speak in monosyllables.\n\n\nThe fact was, as my mother would butt in at this point in the story,\nthat she was awed by this handsome young man with such thick wavy hair and\nwho spoke with an enticing foreign accent.\n\n\nI suppose she meant his Dutch-tinted English.\n\n\nMy mother was also very conscious of her command of English.\n\n\nShe had come from Sibu ( Sarawak) to study at the Methodist Girls\'\nSchool in Singapore.\n\n\nShe knew very little English then, having been educated in a Chinese\nschool at home.\n\n\nWhen she met my father, however, she was already teaching English in\nChong Hock, a Chinese school in Chinatown.\n\n\nIt was her reserved nature that prevented her from expressing herself\nfully.\n\n\nApparently, in spite of her reticence, my mother had many suitors.\n\n\nThough my father was encouraged by the Lows, he was rather hesitant\nabout pressing his suit.\n\n\nWhen he finally plucked up the courage to propose to her, he had to\nconfess that he had only five dollars to his name.\n\n\nMy mother must have been a very " liberated" woman, for she knew that\nshe was earning more than he, and had a stable job as compared to his\nunpredictable one.\n\n\nThey were married in St Paul\'s Church in Serangoon Road on 3 August\n1943 and at the wedding reception, Ethel provided the music.\n\n\nA year later, Sylvia, their first daughter was born.\n\n\nHardly a few months old, she was transported to Sumatra where the new\nfamily waited out the war years.\n\n\nOn their return to Singapore in 1947, my father settled down to the\nlife of a music teacher.\n\n\nOr so my mother thought.\n\n\nShe had no idea that he had other aspirations.\n\n\nPerhaps he did not either.\n\n\nIt was his ingenuity, tremendous energy and enthusiasm, coupled with\na flair for interpersonal communication that propelled him from one project\nto another.\n\n\nMy father rented, and later bought the property at 22 Balmoral\nCrescent which he named " La Chanterelle", the name for the E string on the\nviolin, because of the singing quality of the string.\n\n\nOne of the three spacious bedrooms was converted into a studio.\n\n\nThe verandah was conveniently used later on for orchestra rehearsals.\n\n\nIn one of the back rooms of the house, he set up a work bench for\nviolin repairs and bow rehairing - activities which took up many of his\nSundays in the early years.\n\n\nSunday was also the day to clean the fish tanks and to bathe the\ndogs.\n\n\nHe deticked them and even extracted maggots from their wounds ( for\nthey used to get into fierce fights with stray dogs).\n\n\nAt any one time, there were 3 or 4 dogs in the house, all mongrels.\n\n\nI enjoyed it most was when there was a new litter of pups; they were\nso adorable.\n\n\nLater, my father acquired a couple of German Shepherds.\n\n\nThese seemed to give more trouble than the mongrels.\n\n\nNevertheless, my father gave them a work-out every morning before\nbreakfast and every evening before dinner.\n\n\nMy father\'s other past time was rearing gold fish.\n\n\nIt was here that I learnt how fish spawned and even how tadpoles\nbecame frogs, for we had some frogs living in a shallow well.\n\n\nOn wet days we had a frog chorus of high calibre!\n\n\nOne of the daily duties in fish rearing is to feed them.\n\n\nFrom time to time, on Friday evening after work, we went to the fish\nshop to buy a mass of worms for the fishes\' gourmet meal.\n\n\nif my father had no time to go, the fish had to make do with oats.\n\n\nOn Sunday afternoons, after our " siesta" we invariably went to visit\nmy father\'s third brother who lived in Wilkinson Road.\n\n\nMy Uncle\'s compound was always filled with cars, for he was a first\nclass mechanic and a successful car dealer.\n\n\nSometimes he sent his cars to our place for " storage".\n\n\nMy uncle sold my mother a Morris Minor which she kept for 15 years.\n\n\nAlthough every Chinese New Year my Uncle asked her, " Mahu tukar?" (\nDo you want to change your car?) my mother didn\'t pay any attention until the\nday the front axle snapped and left her stranded in the middle of the road!\n\n\nOn other Sundays, we would go to the 4 o\'clock show at Cathay,\nCapitol or Odeon.\n\n\nA stroll in the Botanic Gardens or the MacRitchie Reservoir with our\nblack German Shepherd was also a treat.\n\n\nThis was followed by a visit to Koek Road to buy a packet of Char\nKway Teow, satay or poh piah.\n\n\nOther times when Daddy actually spent time with us was at our evening\nbadminton sessions or when we slept in the air-conditioned studio on hot\nnights.\n\n\nWe would drag our matresses into the room and camp there.\n\n\nHe would play us his favourite records or show us his book on gold\nfishes.\n\n\nhe regaled us with stories about composers.\n\n\nI particularly liked the book on " Papa" Haydn, and how Dad told us\nthe story of the " Surprise" Symphony.\n\n\nDad would sing the opening bars of the Symphony to us.\n\n\nit consists of a soft passage in the strings.\n\n\nThen suddenly, would come a loud chord ( the " surprise") and\nfrighten all of us.\n\n\nit was fun to wait for the big bang!\n\n\nThe advent of black and white television in 1963 brought a total\nchange in the after dinner schedule.\n\n\nI remember the first week of transmission when we were glued to the\nbox, be they Chinese, Malay or Indian programme.\n\n\nWe watched it all from the first " Vanakam" to the last " Goodnight".\n\n\nMy father loved watching TV.\n\n\nI suppose it was good relaxation.\n\n\nBonanza and Hawaii Five-O were two of his favourites.\n\n\nHe would never miss any of the Mantovani Programs.\n\n\nBoxing and wrestling were his preferred sports - from the armchair,\nthat is.\n\n\nConversations at dinner time were fun and so were those languid\nevenings spent lounging on the cushioned can furniture on the verandah.\n\n\nIn later years, when Dad became more involved in his impresario work\nand when we had to tackle our homework, these lazy nights on the verandah\nbecame few and far between.\n\n\nMy father was a very sociable person and had a group of friends with\nwhom he played tennis and went to parties.\n\n\nIt was fun for us kids to peer out from the studio at the grown-ups\nenjoying themselves dancing on the verandah at our balmoral Crescent house.\n\n\nThe old dance records would be spinning on the turntable of the\ngramophone and we giggled at the contortions of the tango and the wiggles of\nthe samba and the fox-trot.\n\n\nDad claims he was a suave dancer.\n\n\nMy mother, on the other hand, was never comfortable in this milieu.\n\n\nIn later years, as an impresario, my father came into contact with\nmany people in the foreign missions.\n\n\nHe would rush off to cocktails at the end of the day.\n\n\nI thought my parents looked a handsome pair - he in his dark suit and\nshe in her Thai silk cheongsam and pearls.\n\n\nMy parents often entertained at home when my father\'s artists came to\ntown.\n\n\nWe children were banished to the bedroom where a curtain separated us\nfrom the adult chatter in the dining room.\n\n\nThe old adage that cobblers\' children are worst shod did not apply in\nour family.\n\n\nThe fact that my father succeeded in making all his children\nmusicians was due to his perseverance.\n\n\nHowever, each child was introduced differently to formal music\nlessons and each one responded differently.\n\n\nI fear my sister Sylvia was the guinea pig!\n\n\nAs she was the first child, my father was keen to give her the head\nstart that he would have wanted for himself.\n\n\nHe recounted many times to over-zealous parents that " ...as soon as\nI put a violin under her chin, she started to cry.\n\n\nMy heart dropped!".\n\n\nSylvia could not be persuaded to continue.\n\n\nHowever, my father did not give up.\n\n\nWhen she was twelve, he introduced her to the cello.\n\n\nIn two years, she appeared as soloist with his orchestra.\n\n\nMy father must have been proud of her.\n\n\nSylvia\'s reminiscences, however, are entirely different, " Our\nrelationship was coloured a lot by what happened during my childhood.\n\n\nAs a kid, I was not really motivated to learn music.\n\n\nBut here was a father who was very interested in music and was\nhopeful that his children would develop the same fervour.\n\n\nSo there was a lot of friction around".\n\n\nSylvia, now the mother of one of Goh Soon Tioe\'s grandsons,\nreflects, " In those days you didn\'t think psychologically about being\nparents.\n\n\nYou never analysed how you were going to bring up your children, so\nparents as well as children muddled along by trial and error.\n\n\nPerhaps Dad thought that by giving us a headstart in music he was\nreally doing us a favour.\n\n\nHe didn\'t consider the child\'s interest, aptitude or desires.\n\n\nAlso, once I got on the treadmill of music lessons, I was expected\nto practise on my own and sustain my own non-existent interest!\n\n\nI don\'t remember any words of encouragement or inquiries except, "\nHave you practised?".\n\n\n" In addition, I really hated the fact that I always had to perform\nin front of those artists he sponsored.\n\n\nSince I was always not really prepared, it was a terrifying and\nsometimes humiliating experience.\n\n\nWhen I was awarded a scholarship to study at the Peabody Institute\nin the U.S., I was rather apprehensive.\n\n\nI neither had a passion for music nor was I that well prepared.\n\n\nDad surprised me by being sympathetic to these feelings.\n\n\nHe advised me to give it a try.\n\n\nIf I did not like it, I could always change my mind."\n\n\nMy father, however, believed that he was giving us the kind of\nsupport that he himself had longed to receive.\n\n\nIn one of his letters to me, he remarked, " It is strange to think\nhow a father\'s ambition could be passed over to his children...\n\n\nI wanted very much to be a concert violinist...\n\n\nI did not achieve this ambition of my life...\n\n\nThen came my dream that my children should inherit my talents and I\ncould develop them and give them the best opportunity possible...\n\n\nNow I see this ambition coming to fulfillment in your achievements\nand that of Achi\'s ( Sylvia\'s)".\n\n\nDuring most of my early years it didn\'t look as if I was going to be\nmuch of a musician either.\n\n\nI was always slightly afraid of Dad.\n\n\nHe was always chasing me to practise, while I much preferred to laze\non my bed after school devouring Enid Blyton books.\n\n\nAlthough I didn\'t cry when the violin was put under my chin, I let\nthe instrument lie untouched most of the time under my bed.\n\n\nLessons would be irregular and they would occur either before or\nafter dinner.\n\n\nIn my opinion, this is the worst time of day for both teacher and\nstudent!\n\n\nMost lessons would end in impatient shouts from my father and tears\non my part.\n\n\nIt was not till I was twelve that my father realised that, if I were\nto be a violist, he would have to include me in his regular teaching\nschedule. \n\n\nFrom then, I had two lessons every week till I left for the U.S.\n\n\nThere were very few lessons which ended in tears then, for he\nrecognised my seriousness and became very encouraging and proud of my\nachievements.\n\n\nThis gave me a lot of confidence.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c10cbbce-eb91-41bb-8376-08c606c9b40a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.746728+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9927704334259033, 'non_english_score': 0.00722956657409668}

You might ask.\n\n\nWell, some would rather not know.\n\n\nThey consider this messy to be involved.\n\n\nBut if a customer fails to buy your product for a reason such as\nthis, do you prefer not to know the truth?\n\n\nFaced with a customer, direct negotiations has the tendency of\nreducing " blue-sky" bargaining.\n\n\nThis is a term used in industrial relations to mean unrealistic\nextremes in bargaining axes.\n\n\nThe salesman and his prospect can quickly size up each other and have\na clearer picture of the range which is bargainable.\n\n\nIn terms of disadvantages, personal selling is a more expensive\nmethod of selling.\n\n\nIt is also slower in covering the market compared with direct mail.\n\n\nDirect-mail can reach a larger target group in a shorter time.\n\n\nDirect-mail on the other hand, may land on the wrong desk, wrong\nhands or be discarded.\n\n\nAdvertising, as another alternative, can reach an even higher density\nof the mass market in a shorter time.\n\n\nIt probably has more impact too.\n\n\nAdvertising can penetrate the private confines of consumers\' homes.\n\n\nHowever, we do not know if customers purchase as a consequence of a\nparticular advertisement, unless we use evidences such as coded coupons.\n\n\nNow that you are aware of the comparative advantages in personal\nselling, you will understand the significance of selling yourself to your\nclient.\n\n\nLet\'s now see how you can do it.\n\n\n PACKAGE YOURSELF \n\n\nSince in direct selling, you have the advantage of face-to-face\ncontact, you should learn how to \'package\' yourself.\n\n\n\'Packaging\' is a term borrowed from Marketing.\n\n\nIn modern marketing, researchers have found innovative packaging to\nbe more persuasive on the customer.\n\n\nThis is especially true in consumer marketing.\n\n\nAttractive packages easily catch the consumers\' attention.\n\n\nElton John, as you know, is a flamboyant entertainer.\n\n\nHe isn\'t physically attractive.\n\n\nBut look at how he packages himself!\n\n\nWeird glasses, gay-coloured clothes and a freakish personality sell\nhim dearly to his audiences.\n\n\nOf course, he has a decent voice to match.\n\n\nBut he sells his image to the masses.\n\n\nSo does Madonna - wearing her inner garments out!\n\n\nIn the same principle, we should package ourselves to be better\npresented to the customer.\n\n\nBut first, we must know what the customer is looking for, in a\nsalesman.\n\n\nFind out what is required or expected of you in your trade.\n\n\nGive the customers what they want.\n\n\nIn industrial sales, reliability and service are two important\nfactors.\n\n\nAs an industrial salesman, you are required to assure your clients of\nyour responsibility in these two aspects.\n\n\nIf reliability and service happen to be your strong points, you\nshould not only make them known.\n\n\nYou should emphasise it.\n\n\nMost of us sadly, take ourselves for granted.\n\n\nWe do have some wonderful qualities I am sure, worthy of mention.\n\n\nEven simple good-naturedness can be packaged for marketing.\n\n\nI use the term, marketing, because it is more appropriate and\ncomplete a term in this instance.\n\n\nEverything to be precise, is marketable.\n\n\nYou only have to ensure that it is correctly marketed to the right\ntarget at the right time.\n\n\nDo not assume that customers place no value on intangible factors\nsuch as your personal qualities.\n\n\nShakespeare said that all the world\'s a stage and all the men were\nactors.\n\n\nAlthough I do not imagine the world to be a stage, it is\nnevertheless true, that beauty is sometimes skin-deep.\n\n\nThat means, you may have good qualities but if these are not\nparaded, you may be taken for granted.\n\n\nHence, the need for packaging.\n\n\nGive what you have to your clients.\n\n\nBut don\'t over-stretch yourself by pretending to be too good.\n\n\nSelling designer clothes to high society fashionable leaders for\nexample, may require you to possess a fine taste for colour and style.\n\n\nIf you don\'t have it, don\'t pretend.\n\n\nInterior decorators with an instinctive taste for space creation,\ncolour matchings, lines and curves, combined with technical knowledge, can\noffer a better service - the customers must know it.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two personal factors which are\nconsistently wanted by customers.\n\n\n Credibility \n\n\nThe first is credibility.\n\n\nBe it industrial or consumer sales, customers always look for\ncredibility in their salesmen.\n\n\nCredibility is linked to trust and confidence.\n\n\nIn my discussion on professional ethics, I have stressed the\nbenefits of practising professional ethics.\n\n\nIf you take my advice well, you will find that credibility is not\nsomething of a show.\n\n\nNo attempt or acting is necessary.\n\n\nIt comes through naturally once it is a part of you.\n\n\n Competence \n\n\nThe next factor is competence.\n\n\nPeople like to deal with salesmen who are competent in a multitude\nof problem-solving abilities.\n\n\nCustomers often have to contend with supply problems, quality\nproblems, delivery schedules, this and that.\n\n\nThe more complete a service you can provide, the better your chances\nof success.\n\n\nYou should aim to service your client better than your competitor.\n\n\nOffer better solutions to his problems.\n\n\nThat will encourage your client to return to you again.\n\n\nA simple trick here is to make selling as personal as possible.\n\n\nMost of us deal with clients in a strictly business relationship.\n\n\nTry to deepen this relationship further with a more personal touch.\n\n\nYou will be amazed by the improved results.\n\n\nHuman beings want to love and be loved.\n\n\nA little more sensitive approach to your selling can bring wonderful\nchanges.\n\n\n LAY YOUR TRACK RECORD \n\n\nUnfortunately in our society, if you have no track record, nobody\nremembers you.\n\n\nIt is necessary to document your achievements, stage by stage.\n\n\nWhen you graduate from the university, your degree is the passport\nto a job.\n\n\nOn receiving a promotion, the letter serves as a testimonial.\n\n\nWithout a verifiable record, how can employers know your previous\nperformance?\n\n\nHow can you expect people to believe what you claim to be your\nachievements?\n\n\nWhen I sell training packages, people ask me which companies have\nused our services?\n\n\nThey want to know what kind of clients I\'ve got.\n\n\nAre they large MNCs or little businesses?\n\n\nEven if I am terrific in my presentation, solid references may still\nbe required to substantiate my claims.\n\n\nFortunately for me, nice and satisfied clients use to write me\ncomplimentary letters.\n\n\nI file and occasionally print them in brochures.\n\n\nWhen called for, I whip it out with pleasure.\n\n\nIf you are a successful sales professional, employers will come\nknocking on your door.\n\n\nCustomers will know how to ask for your service.\n\n\nOne success generates another.\n\n\nThat\'s the reason why you must lay your track record.\n\n\nEntrepreneurs like to drive Mercedes and BMW cars.\n\n\nThey carry gold-plated, branded pens in their shirt pockets.\n\n\nWhy do they indulge in these symbols of wealth?\n\n\nThe answer is obvious.\n\n\nOther people should know that they are successful.\n\n\nBy displaying a favourable public impression, they can win your\nconfidence.\n\n\nIn every job that you undertake or any industry that you work in,\ntake my advice - make a mark for yourself!\n\n\nIt is not that flattery that counts.\n\n\nIt is the very real benefit derived from having a prominent track\nrecord.\n\n\nPeople keep coming back to you.\n\n\nEmployers and customers alike.\n\n\nEverybody loves a winner.\n\n\nIn my own case, I did not have the benefit of early foresight.\n\n\nImagine the opportunities that were lost.\n\n\nBut I was fortunate.\n\n\nOn several occasions, I discovered that I had actually left behind\nfavourable impressions in some of the industries.\n\n\nI experienced great pleasure, meeting old customers who complimented\nme.\n\n\nThey even asked me to return to that industry again.\n\n\nOf course, they pledged their support for me.\n\n\nPeople do remember you if you were good at your job.\n\n\nAnd you never know how useful this might be.\n\n\nYou can also have competitors who \'love\' and hate you for good.\n\n\nWhen you are a good salesman, they will remember you for a different\nreason.\n\n\nEither way, it is a worthy track record.\n\n\nLet me use a product instead, as an analogy to illustrate my point.\n\n\nWhy do marketeers brand their product?\n\n\nWhy are large sums of money spent to create a favourable public\nimage for a product?\n\n\nA brand is an identity.\n\n\nThe more favourable it is, the more consumers will demand it.\n\n\nWhen a brand becomes a generic name, consumers recall it easily.\n\n\nSales will continue as long as people remember the brand.\n\n\nDo you still remember household names like Brands Essence of\nchicken, Colgate toothpaste, Gillette razors, Nestum and Scotchtape?\n\n\nScotchtape is so successful that the brand name has become a generic\nword used to describe adhesive tapes.\n\n\nWhen is the last time you instruct your secretary to buy " adhesive\ntapes"? \n\n\nYou will, I am sure, remember Tupperware too.\n\n\nDuring the days of Tupperware parties, housewives and sisters\ncollected enough companions to eat, drink and socialise at such parties.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '446bbc4b-5010-4f80-9da0-fa3da84b08fe', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.747857+00:00', 'english_score': 0.970054030418396, 'non_english_score': 0.029945969581604004}

Air-Raid \n\n\nDecember 8th, 1941 is a date that I shall never forget.\n\n\nI was sleeping fitfully in the early hours of that morning when two\nloud explosions woke me.\n\n\n" Air-raid," shouted my wife Kay, and we rushed out of bed to our\nmakeshift shelter - a stout table in the corridor with a mattress under it.\n\n\nMy brother who had been sleeping out on the veranda followed suit.\n\n\nHe averred that he had seen flames in the direction of the FMS Hostel\nfor Medical Students barely a mile away from our house and heard loud\nexplosions.\n\n\nAs we waited we could hear the low drone of planes approaching - a\nsound new to us.\n\n\nPresently the planes passed overhead and we steeled ourselves for the\nbombs which might follow, but they did not.\n\n\nInstead, the planes flew on, and we heard the sound of anti-aircraft\nfire.\n\n\nSome distance away, they dropped more bombs and then there was\nsilence.\n\n\nOnly then did the air-raid siren sound the " alert" indicating that\nan air-raid was in progress.\n\n\nThere was a long wait for the " all clear" signal and we had time to\nreflect on our plight.\n\n\nThe planes were probably Japanese.\n\n\nBBC had earlier reported that a large convoy of Japanese ships had\nbee sighted in the Gulf of Siam but speculation was rife as to their\nintentions.\n\n\nWere they going to attack Siam or would the convoy head south for\nSingapore?\n\n\nIf so, we were prepared for such an invasion.\n\n\nThe entire southern coast bristled with machine guns inside stout\npill-boxes, some parts were mined and the whole area was strewn with barbed\nwire defenses.\n\n\nAlso, our guns at Blakang Mati could easily outrange any naval guns\nthat the Japanese navy could deploy.\n\n\nBesides that, we had two large warships defending our coast - the\nbattleship Prince of Wales and the battle cruiser Repulse.\n\n\nTherefore we felt safe from invasion.\n\n\nSoon the long awaited " all clear" signal was heard and almost\nimmediately my phone rang and I was summoned to the Admission Room of our\nhospital to attend to casualties that had started to pour in.\n\n\nI hurried over and upon arrival I was appalled at what I saw.\n\n\nThe Admission Room was meant to take only two cases at a time but was\nnow chock-full of casualties.\n\n\nThere were at least a dozen cases waiting to be admitted.\n\n\nThe room reeked of blood, burnt flesh and gunpowder and looked more\nlike a charnel house than a hospital.\n\n\nWounds of every description could be found among the casualties -\ndeep gashes, small puncture wounds, burns fractures, protruding viscera, etc.\n\n\nI suddenly realised that I had the distinction of being the first\ndoctor in Singapore to attend to casualties in this first air-raid.\n\n\nLater, other doctors came to help and I left for my assignment as an\nanaesthetist in the Operation Theatre.\n\n\nI arrived at D Theatre in the midst of a flurry of activity.\n\n\nThe chief surgeon had not yet arrived, but almost everybody else was\nthere including my young assistant, a quiet medical student with whom I had\nhad a few practice sessions before.\n\n\nA diligent and intelligent young man, I expected great things out of\nhim.\n\n\n( I was not disappointed for after the war, he became Professor of\nBacteriology, one of the first Asians to hold such a high post in the local\nuniversity).\n\n\nSoon the chief surgeon arrived and work continued in earnest.\n\n\nTo save time, I delegated patients to my assistant during the last\nstages of the operation ( the " stitching up" as it was called).\n\n\nI would then proceed with the induction of the next case.\n\n\nI remember feeling sorry for these initial casualties who had done\nnothing to deserve such terrible punishment - their only fault being that\nthey happened to be in the path of the falling bombs.\n\n\nI reflected that it was just the beginning and that in the days to\ncome, more would suffer, perhaps hundreds, perhaps thousands.\n\n\nFrom all walks of life they would come, both male and female, and of\nall ages - from the " mewling and puking infant" to the old man with one foot\nin the grave - all victims of unprovoked attacks, all sufferers from\nindiscriminate bombings.\n\n\nThe wounds sustained by the casualties were ugly and cruel-looking,\nmany contaminated with dirt, debris or foreign matter.\n\n\nSome of the lesions were large and evil-looking, big gashes in the\nbody, but fortunately not deep enough to destroy any vital structure.\n\n\nOthers consisted of complicated fractures of the bones, the spine or\nthe skull and yet others consisted of small entry wounds concealing gross\ndestruction of the internal organs such as ruptured intestines, liver or lung\n- destruction so great that the surgeon could do nothing to help except to\nsew up the incision and send the patient back to ward to die - mute\ntestimonies of Man\'s gross inhumanity to man.\n\n\nWe were so busy that we lost all track of time.\n\n\nThe operation theatre curtains were drawn because of blackout\nprocedures and we had no means of distinguishing night from day except for\nthe wall clock.\n\n\nDuring a lull in our activities, we chanced to look at the clock and\nto our surprise, the time was 9.00 a.m.\n\n\nThe chief promptly declared a recess of one hour for breakfast.\n\n\nAs I emerged into the bright sunlight outside the theatre, I spied a\ncolleague with a newspaper under his arm.\n\n\nI made a beeline for him and all but grabbed the newspaper from him.\n\n\nThere, on the front page was the caption: Japan declares war on\nBritain and the USA.\n\n\nJapan had ushered in hostilities by bombing Pearl Harbour and landing\ntroops in Kota Bahru, Singora and Patani on the east coast of the Siamese -\nMalayan Peninsula.\n\n\nBefore this I had never heard of Pearl Harbour.\n\n\nI thought at first that must be a harbour at the mouth of the Pearl\nRiver in Canton, China, until I read further and realised that it was a great\nUS naval base in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\n\nI knew of course where Kota Bahru, Singora and Patani were.\n\n\nThey were supposed have been strongly defended.\n\n\nThe Japanese were reported to be proceeding in two columns - one\nwestwards and the other southwards, spreading fear and panic as they\nadvanced.\n\n\nAs I was pondering over this information, I noticed a small group of\nEuropeans huddled outside the theatre.\n\n\nThey all looked decidedly dishabille and what clothes they had on\nwere crumpled.\n\n\nOne of them was clad only in a sarong and was bare from the waist\nupwards, his hairy torso glistening with sweat.\n\n\nI thought he was one of those Europeans who had " gone native." It\ntranspired that they were refugees from the east coast of Malaya - doctors\nand nurses who had been hurriedly evacuated with no time to pack and most of\nthem had left with only what they were wearing: he of the bare torso was one\nof them.\n\n\nI found out later, however, that he wore this peculiar accoutrement\nby choice for I later saw him operating in this peculiar outfit - cap, mask,\ngloves, sarong and sans everything else.\n\n\nIt was his way of beating the tropical heat and his method of\nair-conditioning.\n\n\nThe chief medical officer ( CMO) then made his appearance.\n\n\nHe was a rather short for a European, and inclined to embonpoint.\n\n\nHe had sandy-coloured hair and a sandy-coloured moustache,\nclipped short in military fashion.\n\n\nDressed him in a white shirt, khaki shorts, stockings and shoes to\nmatch and a toupee or solar hat and he would be the very model of the\ncolonial gentleman out of the pages of Punch.\n\n\n( " Gad, sir, the country is going to the dogs, what?").\n\n\nAt that moment, he was looking rather worried, and to test the\nofficial reaction to the war, I ventured the following gambit, " Do you think\nour chaps can clear up this mess before Christmas?\n\n\n" Eh?" he replied absent-mindedly.\n\n\n" Why, sure, of course".\n\n\n( Must show a stiff upper lip, y\'know).\n\n\nThis was about the time the nurses returned from breakfast and we\nsoon saw the matron in her distinctive blue uniform coming towards us\nfollowed by a bevy of young nurses on their way to their respective wards.\n\n\nIt gave the CMO an opportunity to break off his conversation with me\nand save himself from further embarrassing questions.\n\n\nHe turned to Matron and instructed her to enforce strict blackout\nregulations in all the wards at all times during the night, irrespective of\nwhether there was an " alert" or not.\n\n\nOn hearing this, one sweet young thing clapped with joy and\nexclaimed, " Oh, goody, goody, we are going to have a blackout dance this\nChristmas." - a remark which remained me that Christmas was only seventeen\ndays away.\n\n\nI hurried back to my quarters and found that Kay too had just\nreturned from the hospital.\n\n\nOver breakfast, we exchanged accounts of our experiences in the past\nfew hours.\n\n\nAt 7 a.m., Kay had been summoned to her emergency station in Ward 2\nof the Upper Block.\n\n\nIn normal times, this was the second class ward, but due to the\nemergency, it was thrown open to all classes of casualties.\n\n\n( Apparently Japanese bombs could not only level buildings but also\nclass barriers). \n\n\nAlthough Kay had not done casualties since her student days, she\nwas not the squeamish sort.\n\n\nApart from the usual run of wounds and fractures, there were also\nquite a number of burn cases.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b8995690-e223-4979-940a-edabd58c6171', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.749252+00:00', 'english_score': 0.984113872051239, 'non_english_score': 0.015886127948760986}
{'text': 'Secret loves of unfaithful women. By Pearl Lee. HER WORLD November\n1995 \n\n\n\'I\'m thinking of cheating on him on a permanent basis,\' she tells me\nhalf-seriously, this intelligent, beautiful woman whom friends describe as a\nbubbly, intriguing mix of angelic goodness and naughtiness.\n\n\nNow 28, Ellen\'s been with her fiance 10 years, and will be getting\nmarried in two months. Last year she had an affair / fling / dalliance\nwhatever you wish to call it which lasted an unrepentant eight months. She\nwent back to her fiance only because Man No. 2 wasn\'t interested in a\nrelationship.\n\n\nEllen, a marketing manager with a penchant for the expensive things in\nlife, had two-timed her fiance with another man she\'d met through work.\n\n\nIt was her first and only fidelity to her college sweetheart.\n\n\nShe was, alternately, miserable, ecstatic, depressed, blissful,\nwretched, excited while her fiance remained unaware throughout.\n\n\nShe isn\'t the only woman cheating on her man. Three other women, all\nin their twenties, all attractive, smart, with devoted, unsuspecting\nboyfriends told me they did the same.\n\n\nThe cheating game, once the sexual purview of the male species,\nappears to have caught on with women now.\n\n\nSome women don\'t cheat once either, but twice or more.\n\n\nIt\'s the Nineties are we finally getting even?\n\n\nBefore you answer, consider the following. Mei, a 24-year-old\nstudent, had been with her boyfriend two years when she was introduced to\nanother man at a party her friends threw.\n\n\nThe affair lasted a month, but it wasn\'t her first entanglement.\n\n\n\'There was an earlier, uh discretion,\' she coughs.\n\n\nThen there\'s Sook Ching, 25, a public relations executive who cheated\non her boyfriend for six months with a Singapore man she met while holidaying\nabroad.\n\n\nShe ended up marrying neither, but is now happily going out with Man\nNo. 3.\n\n\nLisa, a 26-year-old lawyer, picked up more than a third language at a\nclass she was taking.\n\n\nShe had been dating her boyfriend 10 months when she met her expat\nlover and their affair lasted a good five months.\n\n\nQuestion is, why do it at all?\n\n\nWhy string two men along, instead of making a clean break with No. 1?\n\n\nThe women say they were hedging their bets.\n\n\nThey didn\'t want to give up the security of having a steady boyfriend\nwhile testing the waters with the second.\n\n\nAs one of them put, \'Never keep your back door closed.\'\n\n\nBesides, there was still genuine feeling for the first boyfriend,\nwhich made it difficult to call quits.\n\n\nAll four women\'s boyfriends were around their age, but the \'other\nmen\' were older from five to 15 years with cars and apartments of their own.\n\n\nTwo women came up with the adjective \'suave\' when asked to describe\nher secret lover, and all four said theirs was \'exciting\'.\n\n\nSurreptitious meetings, dinners in expensive restaurants - the\naffairs were conducted, for most of the part, at night, and in a cloud of\nsecrecy.\n\n\nEllen was the only one who went out in public often movies, shopping\ncentres but she was careful not to be seen holding hands with him.\n\n\nReal sexual intimacy took place in his apartment and a hotel in town.\n\n\nMei, constantly paranoid about bumping into her boyfriend or his\nfriends, made sure she always knew where he was, and avoided the places where\nhe hung out.\n\n\nEven then, she only relaxed when she was at the other man\'s house, or\nat his country club.\n\n\nEllen and her fiance seemed the perfect couple, envied and admired,\nthe ones who would move on to marriage, kids, and a golden anniversary.\n\n\nHer parents approved of him.\n\n\nHer friends liked him.\n\n\nBut after nine years together, she didn\'t know if she loved him.\n\n\nEllen, a high-flyer, wanted someone she could look up to.\n\n\nThen along came Keith, a few years he senior, but already hugely\nsuccessful.\n\n\nHe was everything her fiance wasn\'t.\n\n\nKeith was her confidante and mentor when it came to her career.\n\n\nHe was ruthless in business, and she found herself drawn to that\nruthlessness, ad the power that came with it.\n\n\nHer fiance, an attentive, good-natured man, lacked the drive she\nfound so attractive in her lover.\n\n\nBut Keith didn\'t want a relationship, he wanted a fling.\n\n\nShe finally found the strength to call things off.\n\n\nHer feelings for her fiance, dormant during the eight months, slowly\nrevived.\n\n\nBut not enough it seems.\n\n\nHaving had a taste of the heady, intoxicating high that came with her\naffair, Ellen is now contemplating the benefits of keeping a regular\nparamour.\n\n\n\'Put it this way.\n\n\nNo man is perfect.\n\n\nWhat I found in one, I couldn\'t find in another.\'\n\n\nNot surprisingly, she\'s been having second thoughts about her coming\nwedding.\n\n\nMei turned to Man No. 2 because she was feeling neglected.\n\n\n\'My boyfriend was always so bo-chap, like he didn\'t care, which made\nme really insecure.\n\n\nI felt that I loved him more than he loved me, and in some twisted\nway, I wanted to hurt him back, to even the score.\n\n\nI cheated on him to see if other men would find me attractive.\'\n\n\nDuring a particularly unhappy phase of her relationship, she was\nintroduced to her second fling at a party - a man eight years older and,\nunlike her boyfriend who was just starting out in his career, willing to talk\nabout marriage.\n\n\nHe was sweet and concerned.\n\n\nHe did \'little things\' for her that her boyfriend didn\'t, like\ncalling three times a day, and driving her to and from work.\n\n\nShe felt \'looked after.\'\n\n\nBut Mei went back to her steady boyfriend because she says she never\nonce intended to leave him for anyone else.\n\n\nHer relationship with her boyfriend has since improved, she says, in\npart because she doesn\'t feel so dependent on him anymore, and she is\nactually more confident now.\n\n\nSook Ching, the one who\'s now going out with Man No. 3, is a PR\nexecutive whose delicate, pixieish countenance gives no indication of her\npractical gumption.\n\n\nShe knew she wanted out of her relationship with her boyfriend who\nwas \'selfish\' and had no time for her.\n\n\nBut she wasn\'t going to leave him until she had someone else.\n\n\nAt first she thought that someone was a fellow Singaporean she met on\nholiday - an older man who knew all the right moves and had the reputation of\nbeing a ladies\' man. When they got back, they saw each other infrequently -\nsix times at most, always at night, always at his place.\n\n\n\'I tried to justify my affair by saying it could either make me\nreally appreciate my boyfriend, or make me realise enough how rotten he was\nso that I should leave,\' she tells me.\n\n\nAs it turned out, she did both.\n\n\nShe dumped No. 2 when she realised he was sleeping around, and\nappreciated her boyfriend another six months - before leaving him for Man No.\n3.\n\n\nFor Lisa, who met No. 2 at language class, having a man 15 years\nolder sweep her off her feet was an intense, exhilarating experience. He was\na European, working here. He dressed well, had good taste - your typical man\nof the world.\n\n\nMan of the world?\n\n\n\'He knew about wines,\' she offers by way of explanation.\n\n\nHe asked her out with a group of friends the first time.\n\n\nThey had dinner, went clubbing.\n\n\nFive hours later, they ditched the group and went back to his house,\nwhere they talked all night.\n\n\nThey had sex on their second date.\n\n\nI ask if she was in love with him.\n\n\n\'Of course not,\' says the Heather Locklear lookalike.\n\n\n\'It was a form of escapism, and he offered excitement, but I still\nloved my boyfriend.\n\n\nIt\'s like going to the shopping centre.\n\n\nYou may buy something new, but you still like the clothes you have at\nhome.\'\n\n\nShe cooled things off when her expat lover started making demands on\nher.\n\n\n\'I was talking to another man at a party once, and he got really\nangry.\n\n\nHe said some things that made me feel cheap, and I was thinking,\n\'What right have you got to get mad?\n\n\nDoesn\'t my boyfriend have more right, since I\'m with you?\'\n\n\nAnd I started feeling really bad about my boyfriend.\'\n\n\nSo she stopped seeing her second man, although they\'re \'still good\nfriends\', and her relationship with her boyfriend made it through another\nyear.\n\n\n\'Women,\' declares a male friend of mine, \'are better at the cheating\ngame.\n\n\nThey\'re more subtle, more sophisticated with this sort of thing than\nmen could ever be.\n\n\nMen are so obvious you can tell immediately when they\'re lying.\'\n\n\nHe may have a point.\n\n\nAfter all, the four women I spoke to had never been found out by\ntheir boyfriends.\n\n\nAll had two or three good girlfriends who covered up for them.\n\n\n\'Every time I went out with my lover I\'d prep my girlfriends\nbeforehand on what we were supposed to be doing,\' says Lisa.\n\n\nFor Mei, " All I had to do was call one girlfriend up and say, \'We\'re\nwatching a movie tonight\', and she\'d understand."\n\n\nEllen, out on a secret date once, was horrified when she bumped into\na close friend who didn\'t know about her affair then.\n\n\n" I went up to her and said, \'Don\'t say anything\'.\n\n\nShe gave me a look that reassured me, so I knew it was all right."\n\n\nAll the four women also let Man No. 2 know they were attached.\n\n\nThe logic behind this was simple: It makes things easier, for one\nthing.\n\n\nIt\'s complicated enough deceiving one man, but two increases the risk\nof being found out, especially in tiny Singapore.\n\n\nAs Ellen says, \'The other man can\'t get too angry with you if you\ncan\'t spend time with him.\n\n\nYou can always throw it back at him, and say he knew what he was in\nfor when he got involved.\'\n\n\nApparently, in some cases, the fact that you already form a couple\nwith someone else makes your attractiveness increase.\n\n\nthese women, already above-average in looks, are a double\ntemptation to other men by virtue of their \'unavailability\'.\n\n\n\'I used to think men wouldn\'t hit on women who were attached, but if\nanything, it\'s an ego-booster for them if you give in,\' says Ellen.\n\n\nI ask if they ever felt guilty about cheating on their boyfriends.\n\n\n\'I didn\'t want to think of it as cheating, more like giving myself a\nfair-chance,\' Sook Ching tells me.\n\n\n\'I felt bad for a while about cheating, then it went away.\'\n\n\nAt the end of the affair though, she says she felt \'used\'.\n\n\nShe had hoped things would work out with Man No. 2, but he had\napparently been seeing several other women at the same time.\n\n\nLisa was \'regretful, in that I cheapened myself and my relationship\nwith my boyfriend.\n\n\nBut there was no right or wrong in the situation for me.\n\n\nBecause my feelings for my boyfriend never diminished.\'\n\n\nMei says, \'Yes I felt guilty - especially when I slept with the\nother man.\n\n\nWhich could explain why we never quite enjoyed sex.\'\n\n\nWere they ever tempted to confess all to their boyfriends?\n\n\n\'Never.\'\n\n\nThey say it has as much to do with protecting their boyfriends as\nthemselves.\n\n\nThree women wouldn\'t have been able to handle a break-up, - and they\nknow their boyfriends would never have forgiven them.\n\n\nIronically, though, when asked how they would feel if their\nboyfriends were cheating on them, all four women came up with exactly the\nsame thing: I\'d kill him.\n\n\nThe four women I spoke to may be just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\nThey certainly think so.\n\n\nThey don\'t think they\'re representative of all women, of course, and\nthey\'re not proud of what they did.\n\n\nBut they do feel there are more women like them out there.\n\n\nSo while some might say that this goes to show how men and women\nhave reached true \'equality\' in coupledom, perhaps they should also ask if\nunfaithful women really aren\'t like unfaithful men after all - merely trying\nto have their cake and eat it.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'fe5706a5-9b7c-47e6-b3ff-4be7554247f3', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.750602+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9928250908851624, 'non_english_score': 0.0071749091148376465}

he smiles.\n\n\nThe rest follows.\n\n\nIt is ever so easy to find someone when you\'re lonely.\n\n\nThe snitch is that sometimes you\'re unlucky and your eyes meet with\nthe wrong person\'s: meaning some obese monster with a belly circumference of\nat least fifty inches.\n\n\nThen he starts leering at you and you feel your goose pimples\nprickling frightfully.\n\n\nAnd you involuntarily shiver.\n\n\nThen you start playing hide-and-seek with him in the lounge, escaping\nto the ladies so that he can\'t trail you, or flitting to any corner he walks\naway from, and when he starts walking towards you again, you scramble over\nagain to the other side.\n\n\nThankfully, the more intelligent ones get the hint and go back to\nlooking depressed.\n\n\nIf some idiot just proves to be persistent, I ordinarily put on my\nvixen-act.\n\n\nI splash my Virgin Chi Chi at him and smack him in the face.\n\n\nI scream, " Oh, how dare you!"\n\n\nThey are usually too bewildered to do anything about it afterwards,\nand I walk off scot-free.\n\n\nThis also usually means the lounge manager will frown upon me as a\ntrouble-maker.\n\n\nThey don\'t appreciate anyone who makes a scene at their place,\nwhatever the reason.\n\n\nI switch to streetwise tours, in that case.\n\n\nThese are located around R------- Road and thereabouts.\n\n\nI put on my Shiseido make-up, my big-bust Dolly Parton dress with\nhardly any front and French fancy stockings and, bombs away, off I go to\nconquer my lusty males.\n\n\nIn the words of Nelson: I come, I see, I conquer!\n\n\nOr rather, I see, I conquer, then come - if you know what I mean.\n\n\nI usually have to take bus number 1- there, unless the day before\nsome guy gives a big tip and I can afford my occasional taxi.\n\n\nYou look more high-class stepping out of a taxi, you see.\n\n\nNext you glance around and estimate your competition, which believe\nme, will make you laugh.\n\n\nSome of them are so obviously manly.\n\n\nYet they try to pretend they are Michelle Pfeiffer or Bo Derek:\nperfectly shameless!\n\n\nI will throw them a Tanya Roberts look of bitchiness and make my way\nthrough to the inner alleys where it is slightly darker.\n\n\nI assure you, that\'s where you find the best customers - and the most\nexciting activities.\n\n\nThen: you just stand there and wait.\n\n\nAnd watch.\n\n\nSometimes there are a few very-green boys who come in and take a few\nscared peeks and then walk out again.\n\n\nThey make me giggle, and I usually raise my eyebrow suggestively at\nthem and watch them blush.\n\n\nIf they\'re cute, they get my sexy smile too.\n\n\nI won\'t mind doing it with them for free.\n\n\nIf they\'re ugly, well, too bad, sonny: you\'re just not my kind.\n\n\nI will divert my eyes and imagine they\'re invisible.\n\n\nUnless I feel very bitchy that night and feel like leading them on.\n\n\nThen I usually make all sorts of randy moves at them until they get\nhooked: I stroll into the darkness and make them follow; then ooops, I\ndisappear from sight and they find themselves alone in the alley.\n\n\nHa ha!\n\n\nServes than right for thinking they\'re Casanova material!\n\n\nBut the usual bunch along R-------- Road consists mostly of American\nand European sailors.\n\n\nThey always come in a group and oh, they\'re soooooo gorgeous!\n\n\nThey\'re always young, they\'re always cheerful, they never wear\nspectacles.\n\n\nThey take it all so casually and do it so skillfully.\n\n\nLocal guys have nothing to compare.\n\n\nLike there was that one time this Yugoslavian beefcake came up to me\nwith his smaller friend and started gesturing three fingers at me.\n\n\nI didn\'t understand at first, but got it later.\n\n\nWe were a marvellous threesome.\n\n\nI guarantee you, they know the most fascinating tricks and are so\nmuch fun.\n\n\nAnd that is apart from the fact that they pay well!\n\n\nTherefore everybody in the alley always gets excited when these\nsailors arrive.\n\n\nSome start to make irritating sounds like they\'ve got excessive\nsaliva dripping from their big mouths.\n\n\nSome begin to groan as if they\'ve been happily knocked down by an oil\ntanker.\n\n\nOthers act like they are cats, or their ulcers are so painful they\ncannot keep their tongues from sticking out.\n\n\nI choose to be more spectacular.\n\n\nI give them my irresistible Janet Jackson walk right past my\nearmarked sailor and fling my hair piquantly back.\n\n\nI never fail to get my man: which shows you how effective my\ntechnique is.\n\n\nIn fact, they are often the best catch of the lot.\n\n\nAnd soooooo satisfying, I don\'t want them to pay after the whole\nthing.\n\n\nThey have already given me satisfaction.\n\n\nMy most fulfilling beau, however, is this teacher I picked up\nsometime in March last year.\n\n\nNow this was at the Botanical Gardens, about ten plus at night.\n\n\nI was sitting seductively on the grass, pretending to mind my own\nbusiness, when suddenly out of the bushes a dark shadow emerged.\n\n\nAt first I thought it was some over-active couple accidentally\ntumbling out.\n\n\nThey might have been carried away with what they were doing or\nsomething.\n\n\nThen I noticed it was just one person, who stood quite still there\nfor a while.\n\n\nIt was dark; I couldn\'t see his face very well.\n\n\nBut it was obvious he was tall and not badly built.\n\n\nHe whispered to me.\n\n\nI could hear he had a foreign accent.\n\n\nThat did it.\n\n\nI whispered back to him and immediately went with him to his place,\nwhich was somewhere near M------- S--------- Walk.\n\n\nWe had a heavenly time.\n\n\nThis fantastic beau of mine, whom I later nicknamed \'Dick\', had\ndarling blue eyes and soft golden blonde hair and was once an American\nfootball player.\n\n\nHe was so strong we did it three times that night and next morning\nhe was ready for more.\n\n\nI never had anyone equal to him in performance.\n\n\nHe was absolutely perfect; and no one will ever beat him.\n\n\nNaturally I didn\'t collect his money.\n\n\nInstead, I took the next day off and stayed in bed.\n\n\nWith Dick, that is.\n\n\nI practically fainted when he suggested we live together for a\nwhile.\n\n\nHe said he liked me very much; and I gave him my Brigitte Bardot\nkiss.\n\n\nVoulez-vous?\n\n\nThings continued incredibly smoothly.\n\n\nWe actually managed to stick together for three months.\n\n\nImagine that!\n\n\nThat was the longest I had ever remained attached to any single man.\n\n\nBut reality per normal stepped in and snatched my adorable Dick away\ninto another\'s arms.\n\n\nThe loves and passions of my kind are merely fetishes which bring\npleasure for the present, you see.\n\n\nThey never last long.\n\n\nIt is a pity, isn\'t it?\n\n\nDick seemed quite the ideal partner!\n\n\nBut they are like cabbages.\n\n\nIf you keep them in the fridge too long, they grow stale and turn\nrotten.\n\n\nKnowing this only too well, I had let my Dick go, and I went back to\nmy spinsterhood again.\n\n\nI still keep his photographs in my memo book, in which he signed " I\nshall always love you" before he left.\n\n\nWhen I get nostalgic, I would occasionally take it out to fondle and\nmasturbate with - ooops, but don\'t let me get bitchy ...\n\n\nSo things returned to normal for me.\n\n\nI get over things like Dick pretty comfortably, and new things, new\nhopes, new men come into my life.\n\n\nI am doing extremely well.\n\n\nThat is, compared to others still standing around that alley in\nR------- Road.\n\n\nWhat with AIDS and give-birth-to-more-children campaigns spreading\nlike fire through Singapore, people like me get less opportunities with every\npassing moment.\n\n\nPeople think it is strange not having babies, let alone fall for\ngirls like me.\n\n\nSo less men become interested.\n\n\nFurthermore, I am getting old.\n\n\nA friend of mine recently told me l had appeared as if I was getting\nquite desperate.\n\n\nAt the time I suppose I was.\n\n\nGoods were scarce that evening, you see, and the most you could try\nfor were one-night stands, which were really much less satisfying.\n\n\nPerhaps, I had hoped, I could settle on a permanent basis with\nsomeone.\n\n\nBut alas, I am getting wrinkles on my face.\n\n\nIt is getting more difficult because everybody goes for younger,\nfresher meat.\n\n\nI am beginning to look haggard.\n\n\nEven my friend agreed.\n\n\nIt is no longer me choosing them, but them choosing me.\n\n\nIt is why I\'ve been going to more aerobics lessons lately.\n\n\nI want to keep a trim waist and a supple anatomy.\n\n\nI am also beginning to plant aloe veras on my veranda because the\nsap in the leaves is supposed to be capable of healing wounds, cleaning hair,\nand most important, keep my complexion succulent and tender.\n\n\nIt is because I do not want to spend the rest of my life alone.\n\n\nI do not want to die uncared for: I need a lover-boy.\n\n\nSo I continue to ramble around and distribute my inviting Marilyn\nMonroe looks.\n\n\nThey are going well, and so have my recent cosmetics sales - I sell\ncosmetics, you see.\n\n\nI target to find a permanent hubby in the next five years and also\nto earn at least five thousand dollars a month and be really rich when I\nretire.\n\n\nI don\'t want to feel lonely when I grow old.\n\n\nBut then - who would?\n\n\nJuliet\n\n\nShe never thought it would lead to this.\n\n\nIn her schooldays, she used to play truant and watch those tapes.\n\n\nFather\'s tapes.\n\n\nHe kept them in a locked box underneath his bed and thought nobody\nelse in the family knew.\n\n\nBut Juliet knew.\n\n\nShe knew how he hid the key in the jar on a high ledge.\n\n\nShe knew how he would take the tapes out and watch them silently at\nmidnight, when everybody else was asleep.\n\n\nShe had a wary eye.\n\n\nConsequently, without him knowing, Juliet, as a young boy, took\nthose tapes out to watch. \n\n\nShe would take the tapes out of the metal box, lock the house door,\nsit in front of the TV-cum-video-machine and watch.\n\n\nIt was the strangest programme.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '938c6130-6e66-48da-8c1d-66fd1e1f7354', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.751727+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9815946221351624, 'non_english_score': 0.018405377864837646}
{'text': 'NICKNAME GIVING \n\n\n" Ant!\n\n\nAnt!\n\n\nAnt!" the boy called out as he stomped about repeatedly.\n\n\nHe danced in glee while his slippered feet went \'pap pap pap\' in a\nmake-believe act of destruction.\n\n\nHe was a skinny, fair-faced, seven-year-old and his neat crew-cut and\ndimpled cheeks belied the mischief was.\n\n\nIt was his eyes that often gave him away for they sparkled with\nmerriment whenever he was up to his pranks.\n\n\n" Peng Peng...Pe-ng!\n\n\nPe-ng!" The shrill summons of his grandmother came from the tenth\nstorey of the block in front of where we stood, and it had the desired\neffect.\n\n\nPeng Peng shot a glance at me which said, " I\'ll be back," and then\nhe scampered off in the direction of his grandmother\'s flat.\n\n\nThe children had a knack for inventing nicknames that stuck so well\nthat you remember only \'Ah Fat\' or \'Big Head\', forgetting, and sometimes not\neven knowing, what their parents had named them.\n\n\nThe names were generally given in a burst of spontaneity, as soon as\na new person was identified or his real name announced.\n\n\nAn association is usually made from he sound of the name or by\nidentifying an outstanding physical characteristic.\n\n\nWhen I first met the children, I told them my name was Anne.\n\n\n" Anne, Anne?...Ant!\n\n\nYour name is Ant!" they sang.\n\n\nIn Hokkien, they would call me Ang Kau Hia ( or Hong Ma Yi, in\nMandarin) which literally means Red Ant.\n\n\nThat was how I came to be initiated into the world of the street\nchildren of Bukit Ho Swee.\n\n\nBukit Ho Swee is the name of one of the oldest high-rise housing\nestates in Singapore.\n\n\nThe name itself is rich in meaning.\n\n\nBukit is the Malay word for \'hill\' and \'Ho Swee\' was the name of a\nwealthy Chinese merchant believed to have been the first opium and spirit\nfarmer in Singapore in those days when the estate was a poor squatter\nsettlement.\n\n\nI prefer the two Chinese interpretations of Bukit Ho Swee.\n\n\nIn Mandarin, it\'s  He Shui Shan  which means River,\nWater, Mountain ( or Hill).\n\n\nIn Hokkien, which is the main dialect of the Chinese people there, \'Ho\'\nis also the pronunciation for \'good\' and \'Swee\' is the word for \'beautiful\'.\n\n\nBut looking at Bukit Ho Swee today, by no stretch of the imagination\ncan one expect to see a romantic picture of rolling hills and cool,\nrefreshing streams.\n\n\nInstead, there is the harsh reality of a different kind of jungle.\n\n\nConcrete blocks of a more or less predictable sameness, each carved\nout and divided into equal parts by the type of dwelling - one-roomed,\ntwo-roomed, or three.\n\n\nThe high-rise was a makeshift solution to a once urgent housing\nproblem.\n\n\nStill - as those who knew Bukit Ho Swee in those days might say - it\nwas an improvement from the squalid conditions it had risen from,\nphoenix-like.\n\n\nIn a great cleansing act, the conflagration of the Sixties had razed\nto the ground row upon huddled row of attap, wooden and cardboard dwellings.\n\n\nIn less than a year, a record time, buildings grew into the sky and\nconcrete poured into what once were muddy, undefined tracks and pot-holed\nalleys.\n\n\nMore than 25 years after the big fire, the children of the\nnickname-giving generation have, like the birds of the new skyline, grown\naccustomed to the nooks and crannies of the tall houses in their sky.\n\n\nExcept that for the children, this was the only home they knew.\n\n\nFor many of them, home was a room shared with father, mother,\nbrothers and sisters, and sleeping ( some under the bed)\nshoulder-to-shoulder on the cool hard floor or a thin mattress.\n\n\nHome was the comfort of a roof over your head, clean water at the\nturn of a tap and a flush toilet.\n\n\nBut home was also the discomfort of shared noises through the days\nand nights, looking out the window to look into your neighbour\'s window, and\ntrying to do your homework on the floor with Chinese soap opera blasting\nnearby; it was looking after baby sister, running down to the coffee shop to\nbuy kopi-o in Milk-maid tin cans for mother\'s mahjong kaki and walking up and\ndown look-alike corridors selling otah otah or curry puffs and nasi-lemak.\n\n\nI had a dream for this place and these people.\n\n\nMy dream was to see it good and beautiful, like a spring of water\nthat never runs dry.\n\n\nMy dream was for the children especially, for in them lay the seeds\nof hope, waiting to be planted and needing to be nurtured.\n\n\n CHOPE CENTRE \n\n\nIt was the challenge of working with the children that attracted me\nto the Children\'s Hope Centre.\n\n\nMy job was to assist the Supervisor in just about any task to ensure\nthe smooth functioning of the Centre as a place to foster a spirit of\ncommunity among the young residents of Bukit Ho Swee.\n\n\nWith the help of volunteer workers, programmes such as children\'s\nrecreational clubs, tuition support groups and toddlers\' play groups were\norganised.\n\n\nThe children and parents came, they saw, and were won over.\n\n\nThe children liked the name of the Centre and promptly shortened it\nto Chope Centre.\n\n\nChope is a word that Singaporeans use, meaning \'to reserve\'.\n\n\nIf you wanted to reserve a seat for yourself or a friend, you say\nchope.\n\n\nWhen in the middle of an exciting game and everybody is talking at\nthe same time and you felt you had something important to say that couldn\'t\nwait, you could put up your hand and say, " chope!\n\n\nchope!\n\n\nchope!".\n\n\nThen you would get a good chance of putting in your two cents\' worth.\n\n\nCHope Centre, spelt with the capital \'H\' so that the word Hope\nremained clear, was for the children a place that belonged to them.\n\n\nIt was meant to be a place where seat was always reserved for each of\nthem, if ever and whenever they needed it; an alternative to the streets.\n\n\nThat, in spirit, was what the Children\'s Hope Centre was meant to be.\n\n\nIn reality, there was always the problem of a lack of space and\ncountless other seemingly insurmountable obstacles which in time became less\nformidable as soon as we realised that we were human after all.\n\n\nCHope Centre is situated near the fringe of Bukit Ho Swee estate but\na newcomer would be overwhelmed by the density of the many similar-looking\nblocks.\n\n\nThe boundaries of the estate are demarcated by four main roads but\nonce inside this perimeter, one is bound to get confused by the branch roads\nand undulating land on which the blocks of flats were built.\n\n\nThere is, of course, a system to it all, and once the blur of newness\ngives way to familiarity, it becomes suddenly obvious that the blocks are\ngrouped together, and the groups are separated by little streets, one called\na crescent, another a jalan and yet another a taman.\n\n\nBukit Ho Swee had once provided accommodation for about 40,000\npeople.\n\n\nNow, even though most of the one-roomed blocks have either been\ndemolished or converted into two-roomed units, and many residents have moved\nout to the newer, better-designed estates, there still remains a large\nproportion of the population who could not afford to go elsewhere.\n\n\nMostly, they are the people at the fringe of society: the hawker or\nmarket stall-holder, the rag-and-bone man, road sweeper, Factory worker,\nlorry-driver, the odd-job labourer.\n\n\nWhen I first walked into Bukit Ho Swee, I felt a strangeness which\nreminded me of the experience of moving house.\n\n\nIt is the feeling of leaving the old and safe world for a new and as\nyet unknown world.\n\n\nThere is a sense of vulnerability mixed with quiet excitement.\n\n\nAs if secretly aware of the need to absorb as much as possibly can,\nthe body adapts to the new environment by being in a peculiar state of\nrelaxed alertness.\n\n\nIt is somewhat like having to watch your step without consciously\nwilling it.\n\n\nThe eyes are quick to notice the familiar, like the sight of the old\nTeochew porridge seller, on cool nights squatting by the wayside, tempting\npassers-by with her simple fare; and the ears attune themselves to\nunaccustomed sounds, like the gay chatter of children at play or the loud\nincessant clanging of Chinese funeral music.\n\n\nOccupying a two-roomed shophouse unit on the ground floor of a\ntypical block of flats, the Children\'s Hope Centre was as unobtrusive as the\nlittle biscuit-making shop next to it.\n\n\nIt was a corner unit and had the advantage of being accessible to the\nresidents, particuarly those of the neighbouring blocks.\n\n\nIn its early days, up to the late Seventies, CHope Centre depended on\nthe generosity of well-wishers for its existence and therefore operated on\nthe barest minimum in terms of space and other resources.\n\n\nOf the two rooms, one functioned as an office and the other as an\nactivities room.\n\n\nBoth were small, so that out of necessity, the activities such as\ntuition lessons, would often spill over and occupy part of the office as\nwell.\n\n\nThere was also a toilet and a tiny storeroom.\n\n\nThe latter also functioned as a mini-library and sometimes even a\nstudy room.\n\n\nBecause the Centre was so small, it could never take in enough\nchildren at one time.\n\n\nIt seemed as if half our problems with the children were an indirect\nresult of this predicament.\n\n\nThe Activities Room was about half the size of a school classroom.\n\n\nPut in a few tables and chairs for the use of some twenty children\nand three or four adult volunteer workers, and there would not be space left\nfor anything or any other person without overcrowding the room.\n\n\nThe office was even smaller, with enough room for two medium-sized\ndesks, one typist\'s table, a common table and some chairs, and a couple of\ncabinets.\n\n\nEvery evening, different groups would take turns to use the place for\nsome form of creative programme for the children.\n\n\nChildren who were not involved in the programme in session were\nalways clamouring to get in.\n\n\nThey could not understand that we were not deliberately shutting them\nout, that it was necessary for us to lock the gate because there was just not\nenough room for all of them at the same time.\n\n\n FOUR VANTAGE POINTS \n\n\nThe children were ingenious at finding ways and means to get in.\n\n\nThey wanted a piece of the action, and if they could not be inside,\nit was perfectly logical to them that they should at least get into a\nposition where they could satisfy their curiosity in part, if not in full.\n\n\nIn that two-roomed unit, there were four points from which one could\nget a view, more or less, of the goings-on in the Centre.\n\n\nView Number One was from the back doorway, which in practice had\nbecome the main entrance to the Centre.\n\n\nNext to it, about four paces to the right was View Number Two, the\nview from the window of the storeroom.\n\n\nThe third view could be had by climbing and somehow hanging on to the\ngrilles at the top of the main entrance which was kept closed most of the\ntime, and had become another wall of the Activities Room.\n\n\nThe fourth view was the view from the window of the office.\n\n\nI had often thought that if this window could talk, it would have\nplenty of stories to tell.\n\n\nIn fact, each and every one of these views had been witness to many a\nmemorable incident.\n\n\nThe back doorway consisted of a wooden door and a collapsible metal\ngate.\n\n\nBoth were very ordinary-looking, like all the other standardised\ndoors and grille gates of the housing estate.\n\n\nThe gate, however, gave added meaning to the word \'collapsible\'.\n\n\nIt had the worn-out appearance of having barely survived years of\nconstant rattling and shaking; of being climbed on, kicked at, and even\ncursed at, by numerous angry and impatient children demanding to be let in or\nsimply wanting attention.\n\n\nThe view from this gate ( the wooden door was usually left open) was\nnot very good because it looked into a little corridor and it was only from a\nparticular, narrow angle that one could see part of the Activities Room. \n\n\nTo the right of the corridor was the toilet.\n\n\nView Number Two was the worst since it depended on the chance that\nthe window of the storeroom was left open.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd1c23aba-70f7-4fe5-b4e9-1f64d061be78', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.752951+00:00', 'english_score': 0.985435426235199, 'non_english_score': 0.014564573764801025}
{'text': 'Successful Women In Singapore ( Issues, Problems and Challenges)\n\n\n\nDr Low Guat Tin\n\n\n Chapter 1 : Successful Women - Who are they ? \n\n\n How Were They Selected? \n\n\nTo write this book I interviewed 32 women in various professions from\nboth the public and private sectors.\n\n\nThey are from the fields of education, law, banking, business,\nmanufacturing, broking and management consultancy.\n\n\nThe selection was based on a reputational survey method, i.e., I asked\npeople in each profession to identify women whom they considered successful\nin their profession.\n\n\nSome names were also obtained through professional associations, and a\ncouple were visible women whose names were given to me by a journalist.\n\n\nI must state at the outset that I failed to interview a few very\nvisible and successful women in Singapore because I was " filtered" out by\ntheir secretaries, i.e., their secretaries informed me that they were too\nbusy to meet me.\n\n\nWhere professionals were approached for names, I told them my\ndefinition of success.\n\n\nI define success as having visibility and the ability to function\nwith some measure of peer recognition.\n\n\nAccordingly, a successful banking officer would be one who is\nvisible, i.e., known by others in banking or in other professions, and who\nholds a position of authority.\n\n\nHer efforts would be recognized by her superiors or peers and she\nwould enjoy social standing among fellow banking officers.\n\n\nHowever, nominators, i.e., those who gave me the names, were told\nthat they may have their own definitions of success.\n\n\nI feel that each one would have certain notions of what success\nmeans, so it seemed unnecessary for me to lay down strict parameters.\n\n\nBesides, my view of success may not be the same as theirs and as this\nis an in-depth study into a small sample of what some " knowledgeable" people\nin the various professions consider to be successful women, it is important\nthat these nominators define the term success themselves.\n\n\nThus the identification of the women was of greater consequence than\nall the other reasons of choice.\n\n\nNotwithstanding this, expertise in identifying visible people\nrequires no great talent or skill ( I ) .\n\n\nIn a country as small and as closely knit as Singapore, identifying\nthe few really successful women in the various professions was not a complex\ntask.\n\n\nI approached each of these 32 women for an in-dept interview which\nlasted for approximately 1-2 hours.\n\n\nTh minimally structured interviews were characterized as " flexible\nstrategy of discovery...and its object is to carry on a guided conversation\nand to elicit rich, detailed materials that can be used for qualitative\nanalysis" ( 2).\n\n\nOne of my aims is to provide opportunities for the women to talk and\ntell their stories.\n\n\nAs I am interested in the experiences of these successful women, I\nhave approached the interviews without a strictly structured set of\nquestions.\n\n\nInstead, I simply ask them to tell their stories, be they about their\nfamilies or their work.\n\n\nFrom the interview data, I was able to sketch a profile of the\nsuccessful women.\n\n\n Successful Women - A Profile \n\n\nIn an earlier study on educational administrators in Singapore, I\nfound that many female administrators were single and had their education in\nmission girls\' schools, where they actively took part in activities ( 3).\n\n\nI also found out that female administrators as compared to their male\ncounterparts were more likely to attend in-service courses to update or\nupgrade themselves, and therefore they were better qualified as a group than\ntheir male counterparts.\n\n\nOf the 32 successful women interviewed, what common characteristics\ndo they possess?\n\n\nCan a profile be drawn?\n\n\nI would like to discuss these characteristics under the following\nsubheadings:\n\n\n1) Some personal data\n\n\n2) Their position in their families\n\n\n3) Their parents\n\n\n4) Their school lives\n\n\n5) Their religious commitment\n\n\n Some Personal Data \n\n\nThe age range of these 32 women spans over two decades.\n\n\nThe youngest in the group is 32 while there are three who are in\ntheir 50s.\n\n\nThe 18 women from the private sector are young, 13 of them being in\ntheir 30s, four in their early 40s and one in her late 40s.\n\n\nAs expected, those in the private sector draw a much higher salary.\n\n\nOne who is in her early thirties and who is given perks such as a car\ncum driver, membership to a country club and other benefits estimated her\ncost to her organization as over\n&dollar;200,000 a year.\n\n\nSome of the others interviewed were paid more.\n\n\nOf the 32 women, six are single, one is divorced while another is a\nwidow.\n\n\nAnd of the 26 who are married, seven have only one child each.\n\n\nThree have no children, one by choice.\n\n\nShe said: If I want a serious career, I don\'t think I can cope with\nit plus children.\n\n\nWe ( her husband and herself) always say to ourselves we don\'t have\nchildren and we don\'t know what we are missing, but at least we are in\ncontrol of what we want to do with our lives.\n\n\n( Partner of a consulting firm, mid 30s)\n\n\nThree of the six single ladies are in their early thirties and while\nthey are fairly open to marriage prospects, two shared.\n\n\nMarriage doesn\'t feature high on my list because I\'m so comfortable.\n\n\n( Top bank executive, early 30s)\n\n\nBeing where I am now does cut me off from some circles.\n\n\nThere are many who dare not ask me out.\n\n\nI guess this is something I have to accept.\n\n\n( Businesswoman, early 30s)\n\n\nThus while some may have chosen to stay single, it may not be so for\nthe rest of them.\n\n\nTheir very position in the organization does place limits on the\nnumber who might be eligible to date them.\n\n\nHowever, it is of interest to note that Susan Faludi in the latest\nbest-selling book Backlash in the United States cites a study which shows\nthat " a college educated single woman at thirty would be more likely to\nmarry than her counterpart with only a high school diploma".\n\n\nIn 1986, the same researcher found that while the marriage rate has\nbeen declining in the general population, for women with four or more years\nof college education, the rate has actually risen ( 4), debunking the myth\nthat the more highly educated and older a woman is, the less chance she has\nfor marriage.\n\n\n Their Position In The Family \n\n\nMost of them come from fairly large families of five children or\nmore.\n\n\nThree are the only child and five have no brothers.\n\n\nApproximately a third of the women are the eldest child in their\nfamilies.\n\n\nQuite a number attributed their success in part to being the eldest.\n\n\nTwo women said: I\'m the eldest ...there are eight of us.\n\n\nI have three brothers and four sisters.\n\n\nThey all look up to me and I like to set a good example for them.\n\n\n( Businesswoman, early 30s)\n\n\nI had to look after my siblings.\n\n\nI had to be the role model, the one to get the degree although my\nfather was a degree holder.\n\n\n( Educator, 40s)\n\n\nLike their counterparts in the West, more than half of the 32 women\nare either the only child, or the only daughter or the eldest child in the\nfamily.\n\n\nA study in United Kingdom by Miles found that of 40 top women 60 per\ncent were the eldest child and 50 per cent the only daughter in their\nfamilies ( 5).\n\n\nWhile being the eldest seems important, one who is a middle child and\nin a family of girls shared.\n\n\nI\'m the middle child and I think middle people always have to be more\naggressive to be noticed.\n\n\nI\'ve seen it happen so often.\n\n\n( Top bank executive, early 30s)\n\n\nIf they are unique in that they are more often the eldest or only\nchild or have no brothers, what are their parents like?\n\n\nAre their parents equally successful?\n\n\nAre their parents achievers?\n\n\nWhat sort of relationship do they have with their families?\n\n\nIn the following section we will hear what the 32 women have to say\nabout their parents.\n\n\n Their Parents \n\n\nIt has often been found that parents of successful women are\nespecially accomplished in themselves ( 6).\n\n\nThe parents are not only supportive but also have high expectations\nof their daughters.\n\n\nMothers are often non-traditional role models.\n\n\nIn the interviews, the positive influences of the parents come across\nvery strongly.\n\n\nTheir fathers are often seen as their mentors and their mothers serve\nas distinctive role models.\n\n\nStudies in the West have found that mothers who work or are active in\nleisure pursuits affect their daughters\' aspirations ( 7).\n\n\nThis could be that in order to aspire to a career, a young girl needs\nrole models who can show her how to combine the twin goals of career and\nmarriage.\n\n\nWomen who succeed seem to have enriching families and childhood\nexperiences, which have given them a wider perspective of adult female roles.\n\n\nThese are what two women said about their parents.\n\n\nShe is 79 and still drives.\n\n\nShe is very hardworking, always learning...and very educated....\n\n\nShe became a widow in her 30s and never thought of remarrying.\n\n\nShe supported me through university.\n\n\n( Educator, late 40s)\n\n\nMy parents are very assertive, particularly my mother.\n\n\nShe could be the driving force.\n\n\nAlthough she was not directly involved in my father\'s business she\nwas always behind it.\n\n\nShe\'s involved in the stock market.\n\n\nIt\'s rather unusual but she wanted all the girls to go to university ...\n\n\nshe insisted that all three of us get an university education and\nher reason is " If you have no education, you\'ll depend too much on your\nhusbands".\n\n\nShe wanted us to go overseas too.\n\n\nShe believes that education abroad broadens your outlook and makes\nyou independent.\n\n\n( Top bank executive, early 40s)\n\n\nA study by Miles found that her 40 subjects who were top women in\nBritain and the United States had good relationships with their parents.\n\n\nThey were often " daddy\'s girl".\n\n\nEighty-two per cent of her subjects were close to their fathers.\n\n\nIt is of no surprise that parents play such a major role in\nproviding them encouragement and expectation, and being their mentors.\n\n\nBut what is least expected is the mention of grandmothers and aunts.\n\n\nMy grandmother was a very stoic woman and had a lot of influence on\nme.\n\n\nShe used to lecture me a lot on manners and the importance of face\nsaving, self-respect and work.\n\n\nTo this day, I feel guilty when I take leave and I try not to, even\nwhen I was hospitalized.\n\n\nHer injunctions are in my mind.\n\n\nAll the people who have a big influence in my life are women.\n\n\n( Educator, mid 40s)\n\n\nSo it appears that successful women in Singapore have parents who\nare achievers and/or who have high expectations of their daughters.\n\n\nIt has been

{'text': 'THE WISH TO DIE \n\n\n ( Suicidal Behaviour in Singapore) \n\n\nKok Lee Peng, MD, FRCPsych, FRANZCP\n\n\nTsoi Wing-Foo, MD, FRCPsych, FRANZCP, FRCPG Maureen\n\n\nFung, BA(Singapore), MSW ( USA)\n\n\n REASONS FOR SUICIDAL BEHAVIOUR \n\n\nIn an era when people wish to live longer, when medical science is\nimproving health care, revolutionising treatment and prolonging lives, why do\nsome people resort to suicidal behaviour?\n\n\nWhat leads them to do such acts?\n\n\nDr E S Schneidman, a well-known psychologist and pioneer in\nsuicidology ( the study of suicidal behaviour) believes that in order to\nunderstand the act of suicide, it is important to first grasp the following\ncharacteristics of suicidal acts.\n\n\n1 There is intolerable psychic pain and discomfort because of\nfrustrated psychological needs.\n\n\nThis could be a need to be loved, to be wanted, and to be safe, that\nis, not to be persecuted ( in the case of those with mental disorders).\n\n\nIn those with physical illness, intolerable physical pain and\ndiscomfort could lead to psychic distress.\n\n\n2 The purpose of each suicidal act is to seek a solution.\n\n\n3 The goal is to lose consciousness and blot out the pain.\n\n\n4 The emotion that is frequently present is that of helplessness,\nhopelessness, anger or fear.\n\n\n5 The mind is narrowly focused on the act and other matters are not\nconsidered.\n\n\nIn general, when a person has reached the decision to die, he feels\nthat life is meaningless and he loses the will to live.\n\n\nIf the suicide is associated with great anger and hostility, there is\nan urge to kill oneself, to be killed and to die.\n\n\nAs that wish to die becomes active, the fear of death which is so\ncommon in nearly everyone disappears, and death becomes inviting.\n\n\nThe decision to kill oneself requires a great deal of mental energy.\n\n\nPrior to doing so one is beset by doubts, fears, anxieties and\nworries.\n\n\nArriving at a decision to kill oneself is like crossing a turbulent\nriver.\n\n\nOnce beyond that, peace prevails - one\'s fears are quietened, the\nconsciousness is restricted to the task at hand and one can start making\npreparations to kill oneself.\n\n\nHowever, the above situation only applies to those who have a\npremeditated plan for suicide.\n\n\nIf the act is an impulsive one, and the deed is done on the spur of\nthe moment, the psychological processes described above do not occur.\n\n\nInstead, the person acts without much thought, as a result of an\noverpowering emotion like anger or frustration.\n\n\n Suicide  Suicidal behaviour is classified as suicide if the\nperson dies as a result of the suicide act.\n\n\nIf the person survives the act of self-injury or self-poisoning, it\nis called attempted suicide.\n\n\nIndividual reasons for suicide or attempted suicide may be similar\nand include the following.\n\n\n1 A feeling of helplessness, hopelessness and despair over an\ninsoluble problem.\n\n\n2 Fear, anguish, worry or depression.\n\n\nSometimes imaginary voices are heard which repeat incessantly that\nthe subject should die.\n\n\nIn certain people, deluded beliefs of persecution also result in\nsuicide.\n\n\nThus in those whose suicides arise out of mental illness, their\nthoughts or moods are bleak and they feel that death is the only way out.\n\n\nLife is intolerable.\n\n\n3 Physical illness, discomfort and despair at not being able to get\nwell again.\n\n\nIn some elderly people with illnesses, the reason for killing\nthemselves could also be that of altruism, i.e., that they feel it is better\nfor them to die than to burden their families with their care, both\nphysically and financially.\n\n\n4 Feelings of intense anger and a wish for revenge against someone\nwho has done them a great wrong.\n\n\nIt has been said by Sigmund Freud that suicide is anger and hostility\ndirected inwards into oneself leading to self-destruction, whereas homicide\nis this anger directed outwardly at another.\n\n\n5 A wish to join someone greatly loved who has died and left the\nbereaved all alone without a reason for living.\n\n\n Attempted Suicide \n\n\nThe reasons for attempted suicide are similar to those of suicide if\nthere is an intention to die.\n\n\nHowever, if there is no intention to die, the suicidal act is a\ncoping mechanism for solving problems.\n\n\nSuch behaviour can be termed parasuicide.\n\n\nThe reasons for this act may include.\n\n\n1 An attempt to change the behaviour of another person, eg to\ninfluence a person to behave nicely to the suicidal person, not to be cold,\nhostile or rejecting.\n\n\n2 A way to force someone to do the suicidal person\'s bidding, eg to\nmake a loved one leave a third party.\n\n\n3 A method of letting someone know how miserable and desperate the\nsuicidal person is - a loved one may not realise how intolerable a situation\nis to the suicidal person until he injures or harms himself.\n\n\n4 A means of frightening someone, i.e., making him realise that the\nsuicidal person may die and he would be held responsible, perhaps by irate\nand hostile family members or the police.\n\n\n5 A method of getting attention and support from family and friends,\nwho view the suicidal person as a victim of circumstances.\n\n\n6 A means of leaving the home or workplace for a while through\nhospitalisation if there are intolerable stresses at home or at work.\n\n\n7 An attempt to forget everything, by blotting out consciousness.\n\n\n8 A call for help to cope with a situation that is very distressing\nand there appears to be no way out.\n\n\nSelf-injury is often perceived by a suicidal person as a very\neffective way of solving problems because the life-threatening behaviour is\nusually taken seriously.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the initial success of that behaviour 1n helping him\nwith the problem prompts him to repeat the action when faced with similar or\nother problems.\n\n\nReactions of friends and family members to this type of behaviour may\nchange, as they become gradually frustrated and irritated by his repeated\nactions.\n\n\nIf the suicidal person\'s problem-solving skills are poor, this may be\nthe only coping style he knows and he goes on repeating it.\n\n\nThis creates a vicious cycle where the repeated suicidal acts result\nin the partner or relative becoming irritated and subsequently indifferent.\n\n\nIn turn, the suicidal person is depressed and upset because of the\nperceived lack of concern and may attempt suicide again.\n\n\n 2) HISTORY OF SUICIDAL BEHAVIOUR \n\n\n Suicide \n\n\nSuicide is known to have been practised during the early history of\nmankind.\n\n\nIt is described in the Old Testament when Saul fell upon his sword\nand died after he was severely wounded in battle to escape capture.\n\n\nJudas Iscariot killed himself by hanging because of his remorse at\nbetraying his friend and master, Jesus Christ.\n\n\nIn the East, the Chinese 5th Moon Dumpling Festival was said to have\noriginated from a suicide by Chu Yuan, a loyal minister of the state of Chu (\n287 BC).\n\n\nHe tied a rock to himself and jumped into the river to protest\nagainst corrupt officials who had turned the king against him.\n\n\nSuicides of honour to avoid capture, humiliation and death were\nfrequent among the early Greeks, Romans and Chinese.\n\n\nThe last emperor of the Chinese Ming Dynasty committed suicide when\nhis empire was captured by the Chings.\n\n\nTo the Japanese, suicide was accepted as an honourable act for the\nsake of face, to show loyalty to a king, commander or company, or as a way of\nassuming ultimate responsibility for a loss, failure or disgrace.\n\n\nThe best-known study on suicide which included statistical data was\nby E Durkheim ( 1897) who used sociological concepts to explain the causes of\nsuicide.\n\n\nHe divided them into three types.\n\n\n 1) Egoistic suicide \n\n\nThis is caused by the lack of social interaction ( integration) and\nstems from excessive individualism.\n\n\nSuch persons live by their own rules and are not well integrated into\ntheir society.\n\n\nThere are too few ties bonding them with their community and they do\nnot share the beliefs and practices of a common collective life.\n\n\nThese people have to rely on their own resources, and because they\nhave few friends, they have no one to turn to in times of crisis.\n\n\nThe change in the traditional family system also makes such people\nvulnerable to suicide, as the ties with the complex family network which used\nto exist are loosened.\n\n\nMarriage increases ties among people, while divorce loosens them.\n\n\nThus married people usually have lower suicide rates than the\ndivorced or widowed.\n\n\n 2) Anomic suicide \n\n\nThis results from a sudden change in a person\'s social position,\nleading to stresses he is unable to cope with.\n\n\nIt happens when a person faces poverty or unemployment, or during\nnatural disasters.\n\n\nOther conditions include changes in marital status such as divorce or\nwidowhood.\n\n\nIn such situations, Durkheim believed that the basic mood would be\nanger, irritation and frustration, leading to angry feelings towards life or\na particular person, resulting sometimes in murder-suicide.\n\n\n 3) Altruistic suicide \n\n\nThis occurs when a person is so closely integrated with his society\nthat he completely subordinates his own desires to the will of the group.\n\n\nSuch suicides used to be observed among sick and dying Eskimos who\nran into blizzards during winter.\n\n\nThe group is so important to an individual that its survival is more\nimportant than his own.\n\n\nOther examples are those of an elderly person who commits suicide in\norder not to become a liability to his family, or acts of heroism found\nduring wars and disasters when an individual sacrifices himself so that\nothers can be saved.\n\n\nAfter Durkheim, other researchers including sociologists, medical\nepidemiologists and psychiatrists examined and expanded the study of suicide\nto include variables such as age, sex, race, marital status and precipitating\nfactors to understand the phenomenon better.\n\n\nAttempted Suicide Attempted suicide was originally perceived as\nfailed suicide.\n\n\nLater, researchers in the 1940s to 1960s, prominent among whom were E\nStengel and N G Cook, came to realise that attempted suicide was a behaviour\nin its own right which showed many different and opposing characteristics to\nsuicide.\n\n\nThey noted that in attempted suicide, the self-injury was not serious\nenough to result in death and was usually done in settings where the\nintervention of others was highly likely.\n\n\nThey also noted that in each attempt, there was an appeal for help\nfrom others, but there was also an ordeal factor, ie there were two opposing\naims - one at dying, and the other at living.\n\n\nIt was noted that nearly all suicide attempters accepted their\nsurvival.\n\n\nSince the monograph by Stengel and Cook on \'Attempted Suicides\' in\n1961, thousands of publications have appeared on this topic.\n\n\n Religious and Legal Aspects of Suicide \n\n\nPublic attitudes towards suicide range from outright condemnation to\nadmiration.\n\n\nHistorically, suicide was forbidden in slaves and servants.\n\n\nThe early Christians denounced suicide as a sin.\n\n\nFrom the Middle Ages to the 18th century, the penalties for suicide\nincluded confiscation of property, degradation of the corpse including\nhammering a stake through the heart or hanging it from the gallows) and\nrefusal of burial in consecrated ground.\n\n\nAfter the 18th century, the view of suicide changed and society\nbecame more tolerant of it and perceived it to be linked to melancholia.\n\n\nOther religions like Islam prohibits suicide, while the Buddhist\nreligion shows more tolerance.\n\n\nThe law relating to suicide varies from country to country.\n\n\nIn Singapore, according to Section 309 of the Penal Code, " whoever\nattempts to commit suicide shall be punished with imprisonment for a term\nwhich may be extended to two years, or with a fine, or with both".\n\n\nIn practice, only under very special circumstances is the law\napplied, and in those cases it must be proven beyond doubt that the suicide\nact is intentional and potentially fatal.\n\n\nThus few, if any, cases are prosecuted, although all cases of\nattempted suicide admitted to hospitals have to be reported to the police.\n\n\nThe police interview the suicide attempters to determine the reasons\nfor the act, but rarely proceed to file charges.\n\n\nIn cases of marital dispute where a person has been victimised, the\npolice often call up the alleged abuser for questioning. \n\n\nThis can prove very helpful for the suicidal person if the alleged\nabuser is deterred from further violence for fear of police action.\n\n\nThe other law relating to suicide is assisting or abetting the\ncommission of suicide, and the punishment in this instance is more severe, as\nthe perpetrator is liable to imprisonment for a term of up to 10 years, in\naddition to a fine.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '13385f17-92cf-4ec2-ad50-e76eeb02ddf7', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.755494+00:00',

like health - is a story.\n\n\nA story of love that could kill the lover.\n\n\nOf light ( knowledge) that could in brightness blind a person into\ntotal darkness.\n\n\nOf life, paradoxically impossible without love and light.\n\n\nAbove all, it is a story of how the hunted hunts for the silent\nhunter killer within.\n\n\nA very private story of almost limitless variations.\n\n\nHealth, like illness, is not only a technical medical problem for the\ndoctrinaire.\n\n\nAlthough the approach of the author is anecdotal - the story itself\nis written only after a period of considerable and intense research.\n\n\nFor the purpose of clarity, brevity, legality and order of\npresentation, I have exercised limited literary liberty, control and\ndiscretion in relation to the chronology of dialogues, monologues, the\npresentation of the sequence of thoughts and feelings, the description of\nevents and the profiling of personalities without sacrifice of the essence.\n\n\nThis is because it is impossible to write a book of this nature \'word\nfor word and letter for letter\' ( verbatim ac litteratim).\n\n\nUnderlying the interplay of characters and subtle influences is a\nstory of things that became right, at times in strange and unexpected ways,\nwhen events went wrong.\n\n\nThe reader is free to share the hopes of the author and to accept or\nchallenge his interpretations.\n\n\n 1) CANCER: THE KILLER WITHIN \n\n\nVictim: Male age 41\n\n\nPlace: Singapore general Hospital ( SGH)\n\n\nDepartment: Ear, Nose and Throat ( ENT)\n\n\nTime: 3.00pm\n\n\nDay: Wednesday\n\n\nDate: October 14, 1981\n\n\nCountry: Republic of Singapore\n\n\n( 1) Dressed in jacket and tie and an overall white slipover, Dr\nBrian ( 2), the otolaryngologist ( Ear, Nose and Throat specialist), a\nprofessional in his mid-thirties, settled down into his seat, bearing with\nhim all the dignity of his office.\n\n\nIn his hands were the X-Ray and medical reports, together with the\nresult of the biopsy ( 3) performed on my nasal cavities the day before.\n\n\nLinda, my distraught wife sat beside me - visibly nervous.\n\n\nFidgeting with her handkerchief, she was clearly unable to brush\naside her anxieties.\n\n\nFear, pain and emotional agony were clearly visible in her pale and\nfrightened facial features.\n\n\nI, on the other hand, tried to put up a bold iron front in order to\nbolster her sagging confidence, knowing only too well her normal \'timid\',\nnon-assertive disposition.\n\n\nShe had moreover been subjected to increasing palpitation of the\nheart, during the past weeks, owing to the uncertainty as to what lay behind\nmy symptoms.\n\n\n THE VERDICT \n\n\nDr Brian, the specialist, a soft-spoken, thoughtful and kindly\ndisposed gentleman, was clearly uncomfortable as he tried to play down the\ngravity and deflect the impact of the report on my biopsy.\n\n\nHe began by digressing into small talk in order to avoid a direct\nunhinging of the apocalyptic.\n\n\n" Well, I\'m surprised that the result of your biopsy was obtained so\nsoon - only a day after your operation".\n\n\nThe operation was on Monday, 12 October, 1981.\n\n\nHe added: " You know, I\'m really surprised to find that you have so\nmany friends in this hospital".\n\n\nI knew instinctively by then, that the doctor was playing for time.\n\n\nThe brutality of the truth had to be filtered out, if possible,\nunobtrusively into our conversation.\n\n\nHe continued almost quietly: " There are many irregularities found in\nyour biopsy...".\n\n\n" I know doctor," I interjected.\n\n\nThe tension was unbearable.\n\n\nFirmly, I put forth the question: " Doctor, it\'s cancer is it not?"\n\n\nHe hesitated and in that split-second flash of a momentary pause, I\nwas actually hoping against all hopes that he would say " no".\n\n\nHis nod, although ever so slight was a positive one.\n\n\nHe replied almost inaudibly, " I am so sorry Lim, it is\nnaso-pharngeal carcinoma".(4) His words tore in like a sledge-hammer and\nconfirmed my worst and deadliest fear.\n\n\nThough I had mentally rehearsed this possibility in my mind, when the\ndoctors decided to perform the emergency biopsy, I was still unable to ward\noff the full impact of this fearsome disclosure.\n\n\nIt was unbelievable that so much fear could be invoked through so few\nwords.\n\n\nWords ( diagnosis) that were based only on an excised fragment of\ntissue placed under the microscope.\n\n\nAn extraordinarily powerful surge of emotion welled up within me.\n\n\nI held myself strongly in check, conscious of how an outward show of\nweakness on my part could adversely affect the nervous disposition of my\nwife, Linda.\n\n\nI took a quick side glance at her.\n\n\nShe was literally trembling, her face chalk white.\n\n\nI sought to reassure her and myself by grasping at whatever ray of\nhope that might be conceivable at that very moment.\n\n\n" Could you operate on the \'irregularities\' doctor?" I asked, my\nvoice choked with emotion.\n\n\nBy this question, I had hoped to avoid knowing the magnitude of the\nreality that might be in store for me.\n\n\nI desperately wanted to be told in front of my wife that this cancer\nwas a small, manageable and operable one.\n\n\nThe good doctor however, shook his head gently.\n\n\nSoftly, he emphasised: " The matter is out of my hands now.\n\n\nThere is nothing that I or Dr Ismet ( 5) from the Department of\nOphthalmology ( 6) can do for you at this moment".\n\n\nI was examined earlier by Dr Ismet - a specialist from the\nOphthalmology Department.\n\n\n" We have to refer you urgently to the Therapeutic Radiology\nDepartment for immediate radiation".\n\n\nMy world crumpled.\n\n\nFacts and brutal reality merged to overwhelm the construction of my\ndefence.\n\n\nNatural defiance emerged.\n\n\nDesperately, I sought to check the onslaught of emotions arising out\nof the \'indignity\' of this scourge.\n\n\nInstinctively, I tried to cover up this primordial terror of being\nabruptly slashed off at the prime of life.\n\n\nBoldly as it were, I asserted to the doctor: " I do not want to be\nsubjected to the pain...the burn of constant radiation.\n\n\nIf I have to go, I go...Like a man!"\n\n\nI harboured the haughty illusion that it was still " I" who was the\narbiter of my own time and fate.\n\n\n" Don\'t be stubborn darling.\n\n\nCan you just listen to the doctor for once?" Linda interjected.\n\n\n" I want to have more time Linda, to consider the kind of treatment\nthat I have to go through.\n\n\nThis is cancer you know.\n\n\nThere is no known cure".\n\n\nI replied, tensed with extreme mental and emotional uncertainty.\n\n\nSpeaking to my wife, I was actually addressing myself on all the\nhidden thoughts, fears and unspoken prejudices that I had harboured on the\nmore \'modern\' orthodox medical approaches to the treatment of cancer -\nparticularly radiation ( 7) and chemotherapy ( 8) - with their terrible\ndestruction of both cancerous and normal cells.\n\n\nAt the back of my mind, I thought that perhaps natural and or herbal\ntreatment could be an answer.\n\n\nOr that there might at least be hope from the experience of others\nwho combat cancer through a combination of methods.\n\n\nMethods that could include radiation, naturopathy ( 9),\nhomeopathy\'(10), and biochemistry\'(11).\n\n\n" You don\'t have the time Lim," the ENT specialist warned.\n\n\n" All the preparations have been made.\n\n\nYou must start treatment tomorrow".\n\n\n" Doctor, what if I don\'t go for the radiation?" I asked in a last\nbut uncertain act of confused defiance.\n\n\nHuman mortality, until now only a question of third party interest\nor merely a subject of intellectual acknowledgement, became all of a sudden\nfrightfully personal, agonizingly real and immutably immediate to me.\n\n\n" Lim, any delay could affect your right eye as well.\n\n\nWe cannot then be responsible.\n\n\nI suggest you go right now to see Dr Kim ( 2), Head of the\nDepartment of Therapeutic Radiology for an appointment".\n\n\nMy left eye had gone completely squint with a cross to the right\njust before the biopsy.\n\n\nFor two months before the operation, I had been waging a battle\nagainst double vision, brought about by the erratic but progressive movement\nof the left eyeball from the centre to the right.\n\n\nThe warning that my right eye would also be affected hit me with\ncyclonic fury and left me breathless and dazed - like no other warning ever\ncould.\n\n\nI found myself wordless, and frightfully desperate.\n\n\n" You better go now.\n\n\nBut first don\'t forget to go for your registration and payment," the\ndoctor advised.\n\n\n" Thank you very much, doctor, thank you," was all that I could\nmanage.\n\n\nMy wife gripped my left arm and led me out of the consultation room\ninto the corridor.\n\n\nHer hands were ice-cold but her voice was clear and warmly\nencouraging.\n\n\n" You will be alright darling.\n\n\nYou\'ll be alright.\n\n\nYou must be brave".\n\n\nI stared vacantly ahead, oblivious of the swirl of people, patients,\nnurses and trolley-stretchers that flashed past me.\n\n\nThe word, " Cancer, cancer," repeatedly pounded and echoed and\nre-echoed in the recesses of my mind.\n\n\nAll that I could say to my wife\'s attempted assurance was a whisper.\n\n\n" Yes, Linda, yes Linda, darling!"\n\n\nAt this moment, the nurse of Dr Brian, the ENT specialist put her\nhead out of the door of the consultation room.\n\n\n" There is a telephone call for you, Mr Lim." She called out loudly.\n\n\nAs we stepped back into the consultation room, the doctor handed me\nthe phone with a puzzled questioning look on his face and a furtive glance at\nmy wife, and said quietly: " A call for you, Lim".\n\n\n" Lim, this is Maybelle," said the voice at the other end of the\nline.\n\n\n" I\'m sorry, I wanted from the doctor the direct result of your\nbiopsy.\n\n\nHe told me to ask you personally.\n\n\nIs Linda with you?".\n\n\n" Yes", I answered.\n\n\nThe good doctor ever so considerate had been diplomatic in not\ndisclosing who had in fact called.\n\n\n" How did you know I\'m here?" I inquired, puzzled.\n\n\nShe replied in her usual assertive manner.\n\n\n" Oh, an old lady in your house told me.\n\n\nI couldn\'t understand her dialect, but she managed the word \'hospital\'\nin English.\n\n\nI know the name of your specialist".\n\n\nI told her that the biopsy was positive.\n\n\nThere was a long pause.\n\n\nThen she broke down and sobbed over the phone.\n\n\n" Say it\'s not true Lim.\n\n\nSay it\'s not true!" She pleaded earnestly.\n\n\n" But it is true.\n\n\nIt is true!" I said, my voice choked with emotion as I heard her\ncry.\n\n\nLinda asked who it was.\n\n\n" Maybelle, Maybelle Lee." I replied.\n\n\nHer call reminded me that I had to contact my office.\n\n\nSecretary Ms Elaine Wong answered the call. \n\n\nI informed her of the result of my biopsy and told her simply not\nto await my return that evening.\n\n\n" Oh God!', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '513cff87-9333-42d3-b3dd-ee55ab4c4e24', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.756726+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9752999544143677, 'non_english_score': 0.024700045585632324}

involves talking to children.\n\n\nBut it is far more important to listen to them.\n\n\nThis is often difficult as adults are used to telling children what to\ndo.\n\n\nIt is far easier to talk and tell than to listen.\n\n\nListening requires you to pay close attention to what is being said\nas well as how it is said.\n\n\nIt means listening with both your ears and your eyes.\n\n\nWatch your child\'s body language so that you can appreciate better\nwhat he is trying to tell you.\n\n\nIn order to have better communication with your child, you can begin\nby assessing how you listen to him.\n\n\n How to listen to your child \n\n\n 1) Show interest \n\n\nOne good way to listen to your child is to show interest in what is\nbeing said.\n\n\nThis can be done by:\n\n\nFacing your child\n\n\nLooking at him in the eye\n\n\nPutting aside whatever you are doing\n\n\nAvoiding distractions\n\n\n* Being physically close to the child\n\n\nYour child will get the message that he is being attended to and he\nwill respond to you.\n\n\nHe will feel that what he is saying is important enough.\n\n\n 2) Provide encouragers \n\n\nThis refers to the parents\' response to the child\'s message.\n\n\nWhen your child is talking, he needs encouragement to keep on\ntalking.\n\n\nIt would be most discouraging if you were to listen quietly with a\nblank look.\n\n\nYou can encourage by responding either verbally or non-verbally.\n\n\nYou can respond verbally by saying, " huh-huh", " mmm..", " yes", " I\nsee" or any short phrases to tell the child, " I\'m listening, keep on\ntalking".\n\n\nYou can encourage non-verbally by your body language.\n\n\nYou can tell your child to keep on talking by nodding, smiling,\nmaking eye contact, making gestures and leaning forward.\n\n\nIt is not uncommon for parents to have a child sit on their laps,\nkeeping him close or hugging him when he is talking.\n\n\nIn all these ways you are telling your child that you are interested\nand willing to give attention.\n\n\n 3) Ask appropriate questions \n\n\nYou may wish to avoid interrogating your child, which happens if you\nask too many questions, or focus too much on details without giving much time\nfor your child to respond.\n\n\nOne helpful way to ask questions is to think of open questions, which\nkeep conversations flowing.\n\n\nThese questions usually begin with " what", " why" and " how".\n\n\nAsking your child " How do you feel about such and such?" is more\nhelpful than " Do you feel good about such and such?".\n\n\nAs with anything else, it is necessary to be age-appropriate.\n\n\nTalking with younger children, especially those below six, is\ndifferent from talking to someone older.\n\n\nYou need to ask more close-ended questions to draw out responses from\na younger child.\n\n\nHe may not be ready to speak freely and respond to open-ended\nquestions.\n\n\nIt is also good to avoid asking too many questions.\n\n\nSometimes not asking questions keeps the conversation flowing.\n\n\nSilence or encouraging by verbal and non-verbal signs would be\nbetter.\n\n\n 4) Enter the child\'s world \n\n\nAdults look at things differently from a child.\n\n\nWhat may seem obvious to an adult may not be so for a child.\n\n\nA young child may tend to engage in fantasy and talk about things\nfrom his imagination.\n\n\nHe may tell you that his friend is on the phone and he wants to talk\nfor a while.\n\n\nIn reality, there may be no one on the line and the child could be\ntalking to himself.\n\n\nTo give attention to your child, you need to appreciate your child\'s\nuse of fantasy and play, especially in the first six years of his life.\n\n\nYour child needs to be understood and not be told, " Don\'t be stupid,\nthere is no one on the line," when he talks to himself on the telephone.\n\n\nInstead, you need to enter the fantasy world of your child and listen\nfor what it means to talk to someone.\n\n\nThe child is not talking to himself.\n\n\nHe is probably having someone in mind.\n\n\nApart from understanding the fantasy world of the child, you need to\nappreciate what goes on in the mind of the child.\n\n\nYou need to be equally imaginative in trying to figure out what your\nchild is thinking.\n\n\nYour child\'s message will make more sense if you try to see things\nfrom his point of view.\n\n\n 5) " Listen" with your eyes \n\n\nWhen your child is speaking, you need to be observant as to how he is\nbehaving.\n\n\nWhat he does speaks as loudly as what he says.\n\n\nA child often communicates through play, drawing and actions.\n\n\nSometimes he will act out what he is trying to say.\n\n\nA child who misbehaves often may be saying: that he wants you to pay\nmore attention to him or exercise a little more control over him.\n\n\nThis is sometimes not obvious.\n\n\nHe may act out his feelings and needs rather than talk about them.\n\n\nSome children are vocal and will express their needs.\n\n\nSome are not.\n\n\nIt is equally helpful to watch your child play or draw.\n\n\nVery often he tries to communicate his inner world in these ways.\n\n\nIt is much easier for a young child to do things than to talk about\nhow he feels.\n\n\nHe may not have the words to express what he wants to say.\n\n\nOf course there are those who speak their minds and those who do\nboth.\n\n\nSo listening involves hearing and seeing.\n\n\n 6) Listen to words \n\n\nIt is very important that you listen to what is said.\n\n\nThere can be two levels in understanding what your child means by his\nwords.\n\n\nHe could be telling you literally what he wants or there could be an\nunderlying message.\n\n\nFor example, if a child says, " I want to sleep with you tonight, he\ncould be saying he actually wants to sleep with his parents.\n\n\nOn the other hand he could also be saying he wants his parents to\nassure him that nothing will harm him when he is asleep.\n\n\nSo the words could mean one or both things.\n\n\nYou need to hear accurately what is said.\n\n\nSometimes you may need to interpret what is being said with what you\nsee.\n\n\nOf course, you would not want to end up trying to interpret\neverything your child says.\n\n\nHowever, it would help to listen to what is said so that you may\nunderstand what your child is thinking.\n\n\n 7) Listen to feelings \n\n\nWhat one says is often related to how one feels.\n\n\nYour child could be telling you his feelings through what he says or\ndoes not say.\n\n\nWhen communicating with your child, it is important that you listen\nto his feelings.\n\n\nThis can be done by entering into the child\'s world ( as discussed\nearlier and observing what he does.\n\n\nOne way to do it is to respond to his feelings.\n\n\nYou could say, " So, you are feeling very angry".\n\n\nOr, You are very upset by what happened".\n\n\nBy recognising his feelings, you are telling your child that you\nunderstand what is going on inside him and can feel with him.\n\n\nYour child will feel understood and will find it easier to confide in\nyou if he feels this way.\n\n\n 8) Responding to your child \n\n\nTo encourage communication with their children, parents need to be\naware of their own responses.\n\n\nHow parents respond to their children will influence the way their\nchildren talk to them.\n\n\nWhen your child asks questions, these could be used to encourage\ndiscussion.\n\n\nInstead of answering directly, you can respond by saying, " What do\nyou mean by..." or " When you ask...what were you thinking about?".\n\n\nOr, " why you ask?".\n\n\nAllowing your child to respond will lead further dialogue.\n\n\nYou can also ask your child to clarify what he had said.\n\n\nIn these ways you can be clear about what is on your child\'s mind\nand what his intentions are.\n\n\nThis is better than presuming you know what is being said.\n\n\nThere will be times when your child asks questions that you have no\nanswers for.\n\n\nThis can be awkward for some parents.\n\n\nSomehow, parents have been made to believe that they must know\neverything and should never admit they do not know something.\n\n\nThe suitable response if you do not know something is to be honest.\n\n\nIt does not hurt to say, " I\'m afraid I don\'t know the answer" and\nsuggest how you and your child might go about finding out the answer.\n\n\nThis will avoid the impression that parents are all-knowing.\n\n\nSometimes children do think that parents know or should know\neverything.\n\n\nTo deal with such situations it might be helpful to say, " What do\nyou think?" or, " Let me find out.\n\n\nI\'ll let you know once I\'ve found the answer.\n\n\nIn such ways, you can be honest as well as assure your child that\nsomething will be done.\n\n\nFurther, your child can be engaged in finding answers to his own\nquestions.\n\n\nThis will help him to think.\n\n\nA parent who answers every question of the child might not be\nencouraging the child to think for himself.\n\n\nThe child could also become overly dependent on his parents.\n\n\n Consequences and problems in communication \n\n\nWhile it is a good idea to encourage effective communication with\nchildren, parents need to know that the process may not always be easy or\npleasant.\n\n\nCommunication needs time and some parents simply have little time to\nspare.\n\n\nThis is especially so with both parents working outside the home.\n\n\nTime with children tends to be " activity" time rather than "\nrelational" time.\n\n\n" Activity" time refers to time spent doing things or getting things\ndone.\n\n\nThis is time spent getting your child fed, washed and put to bed.\n\n\nIt may involve going about with household chores.\n\n\nThough needed, such times may take your attention away from your\nchild.\n\n\nYou may be so busy getting things done for and with your child that\nlittle time is spent talking and listening to him.\n\n\nTo ensure useful communication, you need to make use of whatever\navailable time there is.\n\n\nIt requires a conscious attempt to spend " relational" time with\nyour child.\n\n\nThis refers to time spent talking and listening to your child.\n\n\nIt is time to talk or attend to your child\'s needs.\n\n\nSuch times need not be specially planned, though it helps to do so.\n\n\nWhat is important is to be aware of available time and make use of\nit.\n\n\nThe other difficulty in communicating with children is that parents\nmay be preoccupied with their own concerns.\n\n\nYour child needs your attention and presence.\n\n\nThis is particularly so during the first 6 years of his life.\n\n\nAs your child grows towards teenage years, he may want to spend less\ntime with you.\n\n\nYou can learn to unwind from work and other thoughts so as to be\nready to give as much attention as possible to your child when you are home.\n\n\nSome parents think that they can always postpone time with their\nchildren.\n\n\nIt is not uncommon to find parents saying to their children, " Not\nnow, I\'m busy.\n\n\nWhy not some other time?".\n\n\nThis can lead to unhappy consequences as the child may lose interest\nand confidence and not be available when parents are.\n\n\nParents sometimes find it difficult to appreciate what their\nchildren may say to them.\n\n\nThey get impatient if they take too long to express themselves or\ntalk about things that border on fantasy.\n\n\nIt is far easier to cut them off and finish what they have to say\nthan to wait for them.\n\n\nThis can discourage children and make them feel that what they say\nis not important.\n\n\nSome children are not very communicative.\n\n\nThis presents a problem as parents attempt to draw them out without\nmuch success.\n\n\nA helpful approach is to engage such children in play and other\nnon-verbal activities.\n\n\nReading to them, when they are young, could be another way to get\nthrough to them. \n\n\nWhatever is done, parents should avoid pressuring them to talk.\n\n\nApart from problems in communication, there is a possible\nconsequence in encouraging active communication with children.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source':

Alex asked.\n\n\n" Oh, it\'s okay, I suppose.\n\n\nWhat about you?\n\n\nDo you have to report back to camp tomorrow?"\n\n\nAlex nodded.\n\n\nThey continued chatting, oblivious to what was going on around them.\n\n\nTheir private concern for each other was rudely interrupted by a\nsudden commotion at the void deck of Block 125.\n\n\nA horde of teenagers brandishing iron pipes were talking in raised\nvoices.\n\n\nMeanwhile, seemingly out of nowhere, a yellow lorry stopped directly\nacross from where Alex and Sara were seated.\n\n\nA handful of teenagers jumped down and rushed towards the void deck\nof Block 125.\n\n\nOne of them crept up on Alex from behind and struck him on his left\nshoulder with an iron pipe.\n\n\nHe got up to confront the assailant, only to be struck again.\n\n\nSara, shocked by the sudden attack on he date, froze in horror.\n\n\nAlex tried to run away from his attacker but could only manage a few\nsteps before he collapsed.\n\n\nThe others immediately surrounded the helpless Alex and swung their\niron pipes mercilessly at him.\n\n\nInstinctively Alex shielded his head from thc attack with his hands.\n\n\nRecovering from her initial shock, Sara ran as fast as her wobbly\nlegs could carry her towards Ang Mo Kio Central to get help.\n\n\nAs she ran, she could hear Alex pleading with his assailant in\nHokkien that he was not the person they were after.\n\n\nThen just as suddenly as they had descended or their defenceless\nvictim, the assailants withdrew and ran towards the yellow lorry.\n\n\nThey clambered up the back of the lorry which whisked them off into\nthe night.\n\n\nAll was quiet again at Block 125 as if nothing had happened.\n\n\nAlex struggled to his feet.\n\n\nHe was gravely injured but kept telling himself that he must get help\nquickly.\n\n\nHe managed to hail a taxi and directed the driver to his home.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sara contacted Ah Siong, a friend of Alex also known to\nher, for help.\n\n\nAh Siong informed Alex\'s parents.\n\n\nTogether, they made their way to Block 125.\n\n\nFailing to locate his son, Alex\'s father telephoned home and found\nout that Alex had already returned home.\n\n\n" Sis, can you get me a glass of water?"\n\n\nAlex asked his sister in a voice no louder than a whisper as he sat\non the living room sofa, his head throbbing with pain.\n\n\nAfter taking the drink, Alex felt drowsy.\n\n\nHe laid down and closed his eyes...\n\n\nWhen Alex\'s parents along with Sara returned home, they thought that\nAlex was resting on the sofa.\n\n\nSara had just finished recounting the evening\'s incident to Alex\'s\nparents when she sensed that something was wrong.\n\n\nGetting no response from the apparently lifeless form after repeated\ncalls, Alex\'s brother-in-law immediately called the ambulance.\n\n\nBy the time the police and ambulance arrived, Alex was already dead.\n\n\nIt was a miracle that he could even make his way home in spite of his\nextensive and fatal injuries.\n\n\nAt the police station, Inspector Ng was puzzled by the assault on\nAlex.\n\n\nThere seemed to be no motive for the vicious attack.\n\n\nCould it have been a case of mistaken identity as evidenced by Alex\'s\ndesperate plea with his assailants that he was not the man they sought?\n\n\nOr was there some undiscovered or undisclosed motive behind the\nassault?\n\n\nThe pilot episode of Crime Watch was telecast on 30 November 1986.\n\n\nAmong the cases re-enacted was the murder of Alex Sim.\n\n\nPolice appealed for information which could assist them in their\ninvestigations.\n\n\nThey were not to be disappointed.\n\n\nA man called the Police Hotline as the number was being flashed\nacross the television screen.\n\n\nSpeaking in Hokkien, the man revealed the identities of two\ncharacters whom he claimed would be able to shed light on the murder.\n\n\nThe police swung into action.\n\n\nThe whereabouts of the two men were quickly ascertained and they were\ntaken to the Criminal Investigation Department for questioning.\n\n\nDisclaiming any involvement in the fatal attack, they nevertheless\nexpressed their suspicion that members of the Ang Soon Tong Triad Society\nwere responsible.\n\n\nPursuing this lead resulted in further allegations that yet another\nsecret society was involved.\n\n\nPolice investigators, egged on by the belief that the truth about the\ncase was close at hand, continued with renewed vigour.\n\n\nBefore long, the police were able to establish that the headman and\nseveral members of the Gi Leng Kiat Secret Society of the " 24" Group were\nresponsible for the murder.\n\n\nThe police had to act fast.\n\n\nA series of raids was conducted at various housing estates and 33\nsuspects were arrested.\n\n\nTen of them were released after questioning while the rest were held\nin custody for involvement in secret society activities.\n\n\nOf these, nine were charged in court for the murder of Alex Sim.\n\n\nThe youngest in the group was only 16 years old while the oldest was\n19.\n\n\n" What\'s your name?"\n\n\nInspector Ng asked the leader of the gang in Hokkien.\n\n\n" Tan Leng Siong".\n\n\n" Any aliases?"\n\n\n" Simon".\n\n\nAfter warning Simon to state " truly the facts and circumstances" of\nthe incident, Inspector Ng sat behind his typewriter, ready to record the\nevents that led to the murder...\n\n\nSimon first came into contact with secret-society activities in 1984\nwhile still attending secondary school.\n\n\nHe befriended members of the Ang So Tong Triad of the Ji It group and\nwas soon recruited into its fold.\n\n\nNot long after his indoctrination into the group, the headman\ndemanded\n&dollar;250 from Simon.\n\n\nThe adolescent was unable to raise the money and reported the\nincident to his mother.\n\n\nThe police were informed and the headman was subsequently arrested.\n\n\nIt was then that Simon had his first brush with the law.\n\n\nHe was interviewed by officers of the Criminal Investigation\nDepartment and advised to disassociate himself from the gang.\n\n\nHe did so...but not for long.\n\n\nThe members of the Ang Soon Tong Triad Society did not take kindly\nto Simon\'s betrayal and threatened to assault him.\n\n\nTerrified, Simon sought protection from the Gi Leng Kiat Secret\nSociety of the " 24" group.\n\n\nIn mid-1985, Simon had his second brush with the law.\n\n\nThe ever vigilant police force moved in on the gang.\n\n\nSeveral members of the gang were arrested and dealt with under the\nCriminal Law ( Temporary Provisions) Act.\n\n\nSimon was however fortunate enough to escape arrest.\n\n\nAs a result of the incident, the remaining society members kept a\nlow profile for some time.\n\n\nThe following year Simon established the Gi Leng Kiat Secret Society\nof the " 24" group at Block 10 Ang Mo Kio.\n\n\nWith almost two years of background experience in secret society\naffairs, Simon had the confidence to appoint himself as headman.\n\n\nHis concerted efforts to recruit members proved fruitful.\n\n\nWithin a year, 19 teenagers had pledged their allegiance to the\nsociety.\n\n\nOn 29 August 1986, Simon and his gang met at the void deck of Block\n104 Ang Mo Kio.\n\n\nIt was during their deliberations on what they should do that night\nthat they came upon the idea of gatecrashing a social function being held at\nthe community hall at Block 161 Ang Mo Kio.\n\n\nOn their way there, Simon met some of his friends and went off with\nthem while the rest of the gang proceeded on to the community hall.\n\n\nThe community hall was packed with youths dancing to the latest pop\nhits.\n\n\nThe gang members quickly joined in the fun.\n\n\nOne of them, Lim Eu Soon started to flaunt his dancing skills.\n\n\nHe danced so well that many girls started to clap for him, much to\nthe displeasure of their partners, who happened to be members of the Ang Soon\nTong Triad Society.\n\n\nThese young men from a rival society closed in on Eu Soon and beat\nhim up so badly that his friends had to carry him out of the community hall.\n\n\nIndignant at the attack on one of his men, Simon decided to\nretaliate.\n\n\nhe gathered his supporters, armed them with wooden poles and\nbottles, and led them to the community hall.\n\n\nWhen they got there, they found no sign of the rival triad group.\n\n\nThe police, having been alerted by the passers-by of the impending\nfight, arrived a few minutes later.\n\n\nSimon and his gang dispersed.\n\n\nSimon\'s gang regrouped later that evening at their " operational"\nterritory at Block 125, Ang Mo Kio.\n\n\nThey decided to launch a retaliatory attack on the rival triad\ngroup.\n\n\nHowever, before they could finalize plans for the attack, two\nuniformed police officers approached them.\n\n\nThey quickly dispersed.\n\n\nThe next day saw Simon busy with the preparations for the attack\nthat evening.\n\n\nHe met up with several members of an affiliated gang to make\narrangements for the weapons he needed.\n\n\nUsing his many contacts, Simon managed to borrow a yellow lorry.\n\n\nThe entire operation was carried out with the efficiency of\nwell-structured military exercise.\n\n\nSimon saw to it the advice of the senior members of the Gi Leng Kiat\nTriad Society was sought.\n\n\nAllies were requested " recce" Block 125.\n\n\nFinally, the blueprint for the evening\'s attack was completed.\n\n\nOn 30th August 1986, Simon and his gang met Block 104, Ang Mo Kio,\nat 7 pm.\n\n\nAmong those present were members of an affiliated gang.\n\n\nSimon contacted his reconnaissance party about the situation at\nBlock 125, Ang Mo Kio.\n\n\nHe was informed that there were some youths loitering there.\n\n\nThe " recce" team also briefed Simon on the various possible places\nwhere weapons could be concealed.\n\n\nThus informed, Simon decided that it was time for action.\n\n\nArmed with iron pipes, the horde of youngsters clambered up the\nyellow lorry that was to bring them to Block 125.\n\n\nBefore alighting, Simon instructed the driver to park the lorry at\nthe junction of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 and Ang Mo Kio Street 12.\n\n\nLike a general leading his troop into fierce combact, Simon advanced\ntowards Block 125 ahead of his comrades.\n\n\nThe place was deserted except for a couple sitting on a concrete\nbench.\n\n\nSuddenly, one of gang members shouted in Hokkien.\n\n\n" That\'s him!"\n\n\nEager for action and thinking that the young man was a member of the\nrival gang, Simon rushed over and hit the man across the left shoulder with\nan iron pipe. \n\n\nThe man immediately stood up but Simon struck him down again.\n\n\nThe impetus for the confrontation having been supplied by Simon\'s\nfirst blow, the rest of his gang rushed forward to join in the fracas.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ccf9b304-ec2e-4d58-9859-ee319aebcd96', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.759163+00:00',

{'text': 'Building a New Niche: The Story of Dr David B.H Chew \n\n\n Chapter 1 \n\n\n Forsaking the Good Life \n\n\nPeople emigrate for various reasons - not getting anywhere in life at\nhome; feeling stifled by the political system; uprooting because of marriage;\nor wishing to spend the remaining years of their lives in a new environment,\nand so on.\n\n\nThe first point was what drove most of the thousands of hopeful\nMalayans to Singapore after World War II; pouring down south to seek a better\neconomic future for themselves and their children.\n\n\nSingapore was like a welcoming beacon of hope, the land of promise.\n\n\nNever mind the politics.\n\n\nIn 1949, a tall, slim youngster of 18 named David Chew Beng Hwee from\nthe Malayan east coast state of Trengganu joined the migration.\n\n\nBut his reason for forsaking his motherland was the reverse of the\nnorm.\n\n\nStrangely, this young man wanted to escape from the good life he was\nenjoying in his hometown.\n\n\nHe was not compelled to leave by economic circumstances.\n\n\nThat was the marked difference between him and his less fortunate\nfellow emigres.\n\n\nThey did not have his options.\n\n\nThe handsome Malayan lad with slant eyes under black bushy eyebrows\nhad his life all cut out for him in the land of kain songket, giant\nleatherneck turtles and miles of golden sands.\n\n\nA fifth generation Chew from Fukian, he was born with a golden spoon\nin his mouth.\n\n\nHe did not count his pennies.\n\n\nThe Chew household of four boys and a girl prosperous and\ndistinguished land-owning family.\n\n\nThey were honoured and respected by the local community.\n\n\nDavid\'s father, the late Chew Woon Kiat, commanded acres of valuable\nreal estate in the choice areas of Trengganu, the state\'s capital.\n\n\nAt shophouse No 222 Kedai Payang, the enterprising Mr Chew also\nconducted a flourishing retail trade in a host of sundry items such as kain\nsonghet - that colourful, exquisitely designed cloth for which Trengganu is\nfamous.\n\n\nHis client list was an illustrious one, including royalty and British\ncolonial advisors and officials.\n\n\nAdded to that, the Chews claimed a distinguished ancestry going back\nthree generations.\n\n\nDavid\'s great-grandfather was the Kapitan China of Trengganu.\n\n\nHe was the head of the state\'s Chinese community appointed by the\nSultan to keep the peace.\n\n\nHe a leading citizen and entrepreneur who helped build the bedrock of\nTrengganu\'s social and economic life early 1800s.\n\n\nThe family business suffered only a slight setback during the\ncalamitous Japanese military occupation of Malaya in the early 1940s, when\nDavid was in his early teens.\n\n\nThe Chews were noted for their humility.\n\n\nThey never looked down on others or flaunted their wealth.\n\n\nThey lived simply, occupying the upper floors in shophouse No 222.\n\n\nMother did most of the housekeeping.\n\n\n" Our house was a good training ground for character building," David\nrecalls.\n\n\nOur father often told us never to show off, never to take anything\nfor granted.\n\n\nHe told us to work hard.\n\n\nDavid describes his father as a strict disciplinarian, but a fair\nminded man and his mother, Wee Tuan Joo, as a gentle, caring and devoted Mum.\n\n\nThey were good and loving parents.\n\n\nDavid and his three brothers, Beng Teck, Beng Chiat and Beng Keng,\nattended the Sultan Sulaiman English School.\n\n\nSister Siok Chin attended Wei Sin Chinese Primary School.\n\n\nTruly, the young David had no reasons to complain, growing up in that\nenviable environment of fame and fortune with his siblings.\n\n\nHe found nothing wanting.\n\n\nHis future was secure.\n\n\nPlaced in that delightful situation, most offsprings of wealthy\nparents would just wait for the opportunity to grab their share and bask in\nluxury for the rest of their lives, without doing a stroke of work.\n\n\nYet David, the fourth child and third son, was unhappy.\n\n\nHe woke up one day and decided that that kind of life was not for\nhim.\n\n\nIt was too easy and too comfortable.\n\n\nHe actually became disenchanted with it as he grew older.\n\n\nHe wanted to carve his own living, to be the architect of his own\nfortune.\n\n\nHe was prepared to rough it out to fulfill his ambition.\n\n\nHe believed success must be earned, not inherited.\n\n\nAn illuminating passage in a book entitled Self Help by poet and\nauthor, Samuel Smiles, had a great influence on him.\n\n\nThe passage, etched forever in his mind, says: The youth who inherits\nwealth is apt to have life made too easy for him, and he soon grows sated\nwith it, because he has nothing left to desire.\n\n\nHaving no special object to struggle for, he finds time hangs heavy\non his mind; he remains morally and spiritually asleep; and his position in\nsociety is often no higher than that of polypus over which the tide flows.\n\n\nWell, the restless and ambitious boy was not about to be a\nsea-anemone, lying at the bottom of the ocean with no aspiration, just\nsurviving.\n\n\nHis father\'s oft-repeated advice to work hard strengthened his\nconviction and resolve.\n\n\nHe chose Singapore for his new life.\n\n\nHe had heard of the great opportunities offered by the southern city.\n\n\nHis father had once taken him there on a visit and he liked it.\n\n\nThousands of other Malayans were moving there.\n\n\nDavid shared his dream with his parents sometime in 1949 after\ngetting his Senior Cambridge School Certificate from Sultan Sulaiman English\nSchool.\n\n\nThey did not a fuss.\n\n\nHowever, they were worried about his future.\n\n\n" Singapore is a very competitive place," said he.\n\n\n" Can you make it?\n\n\nCan you endure the hardships?"\n\n\n" I\'ll try," David replied.\n\n\n" I\'m determined to be somebody on my own.\n\n\nI\'ll ask Uncle Woon Poh to help me look for a job".\n\n\nDavid wrote to his uncle in Singapore.\n\n\nThe late Woon Poh ( his father\'s eldest brother), lived at Kurau.\n\n\nA bachelor, he was a director of several companies including Boustead\nRubber Estate and Public Life Insurance.\n\n\nAs a prominent businessman with good contacts, he was the right man\nto approach.\n\n\nWhile waiting for his uncle\'s reply, David looked for a temporary\njob.\n\n\nHe might as well start earning his keep and get some work experience.\n\n\nHe found a clerical post in the Chief Police Officer\'s Department,\nKuala Tren Police Force.\n\n\nOne anxious month passed, then two.\n\n\nThere was no news from Uncle Woon Poh.\n\n\nDavid lost hope.\n\n\nNot wanting to bother his busy uncle too much, he applied for a job\nin several organisations in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\nThe Malayan capital would be a good alternative to Singapore.\n\n\nIn October, one of these organisations, the Immigration Department,\ncalled him for an interview.\n\n\nHe took a bus to attend the interview in Kota Bahru, Kelantan.\n\n\nBarely had he returned to Trengganu when the reply from Singapore\ncame.\n\n\nUncle Woon Poh had arranged a job for David at the Malayan Airways as\na Traffic Officer.\n\n\nDavid was to come down to Singapore as soon as possible and see Alan\nBohm, the Traffic Manager.\n\n\nDavid was in seventh heaven.\n\n\nHe did not give the offer a second thought.\n\n\nHe wrote back, accepting the post.\n\n\nHe broke the happy news to his family.\n\n\nSwiftly, he settled his personal affairs and made preparations for\nhis journey.\n\n\nHe would take a boat.\n\n\nHe booked his passage on the Ho Hong which was leaving in November.\n\n\nThe fare was\n&dollar;5.50 for berth only.\n\n\nDavid chose sea travel because it was the best, safest and cheapest\nfor him at the time.\n\n\nTo fly would have been expensive and since there was no direct air\nservice between Trengganu and Singapore, he would have had to motor to Kuala\nLumpur to catch a flight.\n\n\nAlso, road and rail travel was risky because of the Communist\ninsurgency.\n\n\nThere was a bit of drama on the day of his departure.\n\n\nHe received the result of his interview with the Immigration\nDepartment in Kota Bahru.\n\n\nHe was successful and would be posted there.\n\n\nIn all the excitement of his preparation to depart, he had forgotten\nabout the interview with the Immigration Department.\n\n\nHe says today that if that letter had come before Uncle Woon Poh\'s\nreply, he would have accepted the Kota Bahru appointment.\n\n\nBut David Chew was destined to come to Singapore.\n\n\nIt was written in the stars.\n\n\nThere was no turning back now.\n\n\nThe wealthy landowner\'s son sailed off with only a small amount of\ncash ( about\n&dollar;100) in his pocket, saved up from his salary, and a small suitcase of his\npersonal belonging.\n\n\nHe wanted to start from scratch.\n\n\nHe harboured no illusions about what lay ahead of him in Singapore.\n\n\nHe knew what leaving the land of milk an honey for a tough world\nmeant.\n\n\nIndeed, he had his first taste of the harsh realities of his new\nlife on the way south.\n\n\nThe sea voyage was very rough and uncomfortable.\n\n\nTh Ho Hong was no luxury liner offering clean, finely furnished\ncabins and white-coated stewards dancing attendance to his every need.\n\n\nIt was a small coastal cargo vessel plying along the east coast of\nMalaya, transporting rubber and other products, and passengers who did not\ncare about travelling in style.\n\n\nAs a freighter, the boat had only four cabins, one each for the\ncaptain, the purser, the engineer, and European passengers.\n\n\nDavid and the rest of the 30-odd Asia travellers ( mostly\nfellow-emigrants) were deck passengers.\n\n\nThey slept on hard bunks in a large common room in the stifling\nlower deck with shared facilities.\n\n\nThe skimpy menu for the deck passengers, consisting mainly of fried\nnoodles and fried rice, did not go down well with him either.\n\n\nNothing like the comforts of home for the youngster born to wealthy\nparents.\n\n\nBut for a fare of\n&dollar;5.50 excluding meals, he could not ask for more.\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the little ship pitched and rolled alarmingly\non the rough waters of the South China Sea as it chugged sluggishly through\nthe waves for two agonising days and one night.\n\n\nAt one point, the young man felt really ill.\n\n\nHe was glad to be on terra firma again as the Ho Hong finally sai1ed\ninto Singapore that November afternoon.\n\n\nFrom the landing point, Johnson Pier ( now Cliff David Chew took a\ntaxi to Uncle Woon Poh\'s Telok Kurau, Katong.\n\n\nThe next morning, his heart beating with high anticipation, the\nMalayan Airways\' new Traff1c Officer reported for work.\n\n\nThe Traffic Manager, Alan Bohm, outlined his duties which included\nthe checking of the arrivals and departures of passengers at the airport then\nat Kallang.\n\n\nDavid was then introduced to his immediate superior, Ho Poey Kee,\nthe Senior Traffic Officer.\n\n\nThe young emigre from Trengganu had completed the first step of his\nlong, long journey to his dream.\n\n\nAhead of him lay the unknown.\n\n\nHe was on his own in a new country.\n\n\n Chapter 2 \n\n\n Drama at Malayan Airways \n\n\nThere are three kinds of people - those who make things happen,\nthose who watch things happen, and those who say, " What happened?"\n\n\nDavid Chew easily fits the first category.\n\n\nHe is no fence-sitter.\n\n\nThe emigre from Trengganu loves getting into the thick of things,\neither to start something or just lend a hand to a cause he considers worthy\nof support.\n\n\nThe man of action is never one to refuse a challenge.\n\n\nWith him, it seems that the sparks are always flying.\n\n\nIn his senior years at Sultan Sulaiman English School, the\nlandowner\'s son bore many of his alma mater\'s activities on his young\nshoulders.\n\n\nHe was also a source of inspiration to his mates as he led them as\nhouse captain, school prefect and captain of the basketball and table-tennis\nteams.\n\n\nSelf-assured and outgoing, David did not exactly take Singapore by\nstorm.\n\n\nBut since sailing in on the heaving Ho Hong that November afternoon\nin 1949 to work as a Traffic Officer for Malayan Airways, he has displayed\nhis calibre numerous times as he engaged himself in domestic affairs, as one\nmight say.\n\n\nHis local adventures began in the airline itself, his very first\nplace of employment in his adopted country.  Indeed, the opening chapter\nof the drama affected his own career.\n\n\nDavid\'s career in the airline started normally enough.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '469952f4-f1bb-429d-b6b2-646b3df844a2', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.760628+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9903675317764282, 'non_english_score': 0.009632468223571777}
{'text': 'Handbook for Stock Investors \n\n\nby Goh Kheng Chuan\n\n\n Chapter 8 \n\n\n NEW SHARE ISSUES AND OTHER ISSUES \n\n\n New Share Issues  Companies who are in need of funds for\ninvestments and expansions may choose to raise the required sum through\npublic listings and rights issues.\n\n\nThere are various systems where new public listings ( new share issue)\ncan be conducted.\n\n\nThe most common ways are:\n\n\na) Public Issues\n\n\nb) Tender system\n\n\nc) Offers for Sale\n\n\nd) Placements\n\n\n Public Issues \n\n\nThis form of public listing is also known as fixed price offering\nsystem.\n\n\nThe listing company will decide on the number of shares to offer and\nthe price of the shares which is called the issue price or offer price.\n\n\n Offer For Sale \n\n\nThis involves an issuing house buying the shares at a fixed price or\na certain sum of money from the company and reselling them to investors at a\nhigher price.\n\n\n Auction Pricing System or Tender System \n\n\nUnder this system, the company first set a minimum price per share\nand applicants for the shares are required to bid the shares at a price of\ntheir choice.\n\n\nThe company will then select a price above the minimum price from the\nrange of prices chosen by investors.\n\n\nThe selected price is known as the strike price.\n\n\nThose who bid below the strike price will not be allotted the shares\nwhile those who bid above the selected price will be allotted accordingly.\n\n\n Placing or Placement Agreement \n\n\nThis involves the selling of new shares or large quantity of existing\nshares to institutional buyers, private investors and agents.\n\n\n Are New Share Issues More Attractive? \n\n\nMany investors are drawn towards new share issues because they\nbelieve that there is a good chance for the share price to rise upon listing.\n\n\nFor example, Compact Metal Industries offered at a price of\n&dolalr;0.75, closed at the end of the first day of listing at\n&dollar;1.66. \n\n\nThose investors holding the shares would have made a profit of\nmore than 100 per cent from the investment.\n\n\nIn general such a phenomenon happens to most issues.\n\n\nHowever, there are also some new issues which have fallen below their\noffer prices on the day they are listed.\n\n\nFor example, SIA shares closed at\n&dollar;4.70 on its first trading day, a fall of 6.0 per cent from its offer price\nof &dollar;5.00 in 1985.\n\n\nTherefore the point is that a price rise of the shares upon listing\nmay not always occur for there are exceptions.\n\n\n Factors Affecting New Share Issues \n\n\nIn the earlier chapters you have learnt that share prices rise when\nthey are presently traded below its worth, ( ie under-priced) in relation to\nearnings.\n\n\nThe same reason applies to new share issues.\n\n\nThe factor causing the price for new share issue to rise is because\nit is under-priced to provide an incentive to investors to buy the shares.\n\n\nFurthermore, investors who buy new issues are faced with some form of\nrisks.\n\n\nFirstly, it is uncertain as to how the shares will perform without a\nprevious trading record.\n\n\nSecondly, investors have to bear the risk of a sudden change in\nmarket trends during the period of the offering date and the listing date\nwhich can last from a month or more.\n\n\nFor example, what if the stock market turns bearish after undergoing\nan impressive bull run?\n\n\nIf it happens the chance of making a profit on listing day would be\nlost.\n\n\nAs a result, the offer price of most new issues are usually\nunder-priced to some extent to make it more attractive to investors.\n\n\n Market Trends \n\n\nShares prices are affected by market trends and sentiments.\n\n\nIn a bull market, new share issues are more well received and\nattractive to investors.\n\n\nUpon listing, there will be greater buying interests and support\nleading to a price rise.\n\n\nHowever, in a bear market, while only a handful who knows how to\nselect the good quality stocks will enter the market, most investors stay\naway from the market.\n\n\nHence, a price rise will not occur due to the lack of demand.\n\n\n Trading on " When Issued Basis" \n\n\nTrading on a " when issued" basis is a trading facility which allows\ninvestors to trade the shares in an IPO ( Initial Public Offering ) before\ninvestors are confirmed of their allotment of shares and before the shares\nare officially listed.\n\n\nThis facility is implemented by the SES with the aim of reducing the\nrisks of investing in new share issues.\n\n\nTrading on a " when issued" basis will normally begin on the next day\nafter balloting of share applications.\n\n\nTrading will continue until the third business day after despatch of\nnotifications of allotments to CDP account holders.\n\n\nAll buy and sell trades done on " when issued" basis will be due for\nsettlement on a single date.\n\n\nThis date will be the same as the settlement date for trades done on\nthe first day of trading on normal ready basis.\n\n\nInvestors should be warned that if they wish to sell the share during\nthis period, they are doing so at their own risk.\n\n\nThis is because they could be selling shares which they do not own\nwhen they find out that they have been unsuccessful in the allotment.\n\n\nIn such an event, if the investors do not have sufficient shares in\nthe Securities Accounts with CDP on settlement date, the shares will be\nbought in by SES.\n\n\n Studying The Prospectus \n\n\nBefore you plunge into buying new issues, you should read the\nprospectus like the way you read the annual report.\n\n\nYou should note the following:\n\n\n1) History and nature of business\n\n\n2) Earnings performance and various accounting ratios such as\nearnings per share, net tangible asset, dividend yield, price earning ratio\nand debt to equity ratio\n\n\n3) Growth prospects\n\n\n4) Management quality\n\n\n5) The deadline for submission of your application\n\n\nIn addition, there are two other types of information that are worth\ntaking note of.\n\n\nThey are: a) Issue Purpose: This tells you the reason for the issue.\n\n\nIn most cases, the reason given is for further investments and\nexpansions.\n\n\nb) Size of issue: The issue size has an effect on the share price on\nlisting day.\n\n\nIn general, the larger the issue, the more likely that demand would\nbe met.\n\n\nAs a result, it becomes difficult for the shares to fetch a higher\nprice as there could be more supply than demand.\n\n\nHowever, if the issue size is small, there would be a greater chance\nfor the shares to be over subscribed and hence a price rise.\n\n\nThis is because those investors who have not been allotted the shares\nbut are still keen on buying will offer to buy at higher prices.\n\n\n Electronic Share Application ( ESA) \n\n\nThe Electronic Share Application ( ESA) system enables ATM\ncardholders of selected banks to apply for Initial Public Offers ( IPOs) of\nany specified share issue.\n\n\nThis removes the inconvenience of buying a bank overdraft from the\nbanks and the submission of application forms.\n\n\nThe ESA system is currently provided by POSB, DBS, OCBC bank group\nand OUB but more banks will soon be providing the service, particularly the\nother CPF agent banks.\n\n\n Using Your CPF Savings for Initial Public Offering ( IPO) \n\n\nCheck that you have sufficient funds in your CPF Investment Account\nto pay for the shares.\n\n\nIf it is insufficient, you can transfer additional funds from your\ninvestible savings in your CPF Ordinary Account to your Investment Account.\n\n\nTransfer can be made by: a) Using your CPF- Personal Auto Link ( CPF\nPAL Phone) before 8 pm on weekdays and 1 pm on Saturdays ( excluding public\nholidays).\n\n\nb) Submit the CPF withdrawal form to CPF Board through its offices\nbefore 2 pm on weekdays.\n\n\nThe transferred funds will be credited to your Investment Account on\nthe next business day.\n\n\nFor withdrawal application made after the time mentioned earlier, the\nfunds will only be available on the second business day.\n\n\nThe latest date for making the transfer is the day before the closing\nday of the share offer.\n\n\nNext, you need to buy a CPF Cashier\'s Order from your agent bank and\nsubmit together with your application form.\n\n\nAlternatively, at your convenience, you may use your ATM card to\napply for the shares if your agent bank provides such a service ( Electronic\nShare Application).\n\n\nAlthough new share issues will likely experience a price rise upon\ntrading on the open market, it does not imply that every new listings will be\nprofitable.\n\n\nThe outcome depends very much on the market trends at the point of\ntrading and the share\'s fundamentals which will shape the perceptions of\ninvestors towards the shares and hence the demand.\n\n\nHowever even if the shares performed below your expectation, it may\nin the long run becomes quality stocks.\n\n\n Bonus Issues \n\n\nA company may issue bonus shares to its shareholders when it has\nsubstantial revenue reserves.\n\n\nBonus shares are issued in proportion to the number of registered\nshares held by the shareholders.\n\n\nFor instance, if the company announces a 1 for 2 bonus issues, it\nmeans that shareholders will receive 1 bonus shares for every 2 shares held.\n\n\n Entitlement to a Bonus Issue \n\n\nBonus shares are issued to the existing registered shareholders and\nto those investors who buy the shares at a price quoted on a cum bonus basis.\n\n\nHowever to qualify for the entitlement of bonus shares you must have\nthe shares registered in your name before the book closure date ( this\napplies to the non-scripless counters where you are holding physical scrips).\n\n\nThe book closure date is the deadline for buyers to register their\nshares with the company in order to be entitled the bonus shares or any other\nentitlements.\n\n\n Your Securities Account and Bonus Issue \n\n\nUnder scripless trading, if you are entitled to the bonus issue, CDP\nwill credit your bonus shares to your Direct Securities Account to your\nholdings in proportion to your holdings.\n\n\nYou will be informed by CDP of the allotment by mail if your are a\nDirect Securities Account holders or by your Depository Agent if you are a\nSub-Account holder.\n\n\n Do I Benefit from a Bonus Issue? \n\n\nYou may gain from a reduction of your cost per share and hence\nincreasing your profit margin if you sell it after the bonus issue.\n\n\nFor example, assuming you buy 1,000 ABC shares at\n&dollar;3.00. \n\n\nWhen the company announce a one for one bonus issue, you will\nreceive another 1,000 shares for free.\n\n\nHence, the cost per share would be reduced to\n&dollar;1.50 (\n&dollar;3,000 divided by 2,000) instead of\n&dollar;3.00. \n\n\nAfter the bonus issue if the share price ( ex-bonus price)\ngoes up to above\n&dollar;1.50, you will make a profit if you sell it.\n\n\nYou can also benefit from a price rise of the shares if you already\nowned the shares before the bonus issue is officially confirmed.\n\n\nUsually, when there are news of a bonus issue for a stock, the price\nof the stock tends to rise as investors chase the stock.\n\n\nInvestors are attracted to the stocks as they think that they can\nbenefit from a price rise after the bonus issue.\n\n\nFor example you bought the shares at\n&dollar;3.00 and on rumours of a bonus issue, the price rocketed to\n\n&dollar;3.60. \n\n\nAt this instance, you may choose to take profit if you think\nthat the appreciation in the share price after the bonus issue may be too\nsmall or not occur at all.\n\n\nYou may also make a loss if for instance, you bought 1,000 shares at\n&dollar;3.60 with a 1 for 1 bonus issue just before the exdate.\n\n\nYour cost per share would be\n&dollar;1.80 (\n&dollar;3600 divided by 2000).\n\n\nIf the share price falls to\n&dollar;1.60 on the following day after the price has been adjusted you make a loss\nof\n&dollar;0.20 per share.\n\n\n Rights Issues \n\n\nRights issues involve the issuing of rights to existing shareholders\nin proportion to the number of shares they already owned to subscribe for new\nshares at a special price ( usually below the market price).\n\n\nFor example, if the company decide on a one for two rights issue, it\nmeans that an existing shareholder will be entitled to the right to buy 1 new\nshare for every 2 shares that he held. \n\n\nShareholders entitled to the rights may chose to accept it and use\nit to buy the shares at the stated price or sell it on the stock exchange.',

{'text': "Eating Salt - An Autobiography \n\n\nby Ho Rih Hwa\n\n\n Chapter 1 \n\n\n My Childhood \n\n\nI like to think that my own beginnings are loosely intertwined with\nthe beginning of Singapore itself.\n\n\nAs a port, Singapore's existence has always depended on the sea - and\nespecially on shipping.\n\n\nSimilarly, as a family, my immediate ancestors had also depended on\nthe sea and on shipping for their livelihood.\n\n\nThe first member of my family to come to Singapore was my\ngreat-grandfather.\n\n\nHo Chong was a shipwright - a carpenter skilled in the construction\nand repair of ships.\n\n\nIn the 1840s, he arrived as a young man in the bustling new port of\nSingapore, about twenty years after its founding by Raffles.\n\n\nChina had just lost the Opium War, and the country was in the midst\nof political turmoil and severe poverty.\n\n\nLike many other pioneers from southern China who emigrated to\nSingapore, my Cantonese great-grandfather must have sensed that this was a\nland of opportunity.\n\n\nHe was right.\n\n\nFrom his humble beginnings as a carpenter, he was later to establish\nhis own shipyard, building junks and later steamers in Tanjong Rhu.\n\n\nIt must have been a relatively large shipyard at the time, because\nthere is official record of a fire in it.\n\n\nThis was described in Song Ong Siang's book, A Hundred Years of the\nChinese in Singapore.\n\n\nIn April 1867 an attempt was made to set fire to the extensive\npremises of Ho Ah Chong and to murder him.\n\n\nThis shipwright, who had come to Singapore in the Forties, had been\nuntil 1864 the foreman at Messrs Tivendale's yard at Sandy Point ( Tanjong\nRhu).\n\n\nIn that year he started business as a shipwright and blacksmith, next\nto his former employer's premises, and employed between two and three hundred\nmen.\n\n\nLike many of the early Chinese immigrants here, Ho Chong later\nreturned to China, where he married and where his children were all born.\n\n\nHis oldest son, Ho Guang Yan, followed in his father's footsteps, and\nalso came to Singapore as a young man to work in the Tanjong Rhu shipyards.\n\n\nPresumably he also returned to China at some point and started a\nfamily there, because his five sons were all born in China.\n\n\nHe died five years after his fifth and youngest son - my own father -\nwas born.\n\n\nMy father, Ho Ting, born in 1892, was therefore the third generation\nof Chinese who, although born in China, spent a large part of their working\nlife in the Tanjong Rhu shipyards of Singapore.\n\n\nOn my mother's side, I am only able to trace back two generations.\n\n\nMy mother's father, Seck Yek Kuon, was born in Canton, China, and\ncame to Singapore in the 1880s.\n\n\nHe became a contractor responsible for painting ships, and was quite\nprosperous.\n\n\nLike many other men of his time, he returned to China and married\nthere.\n\n\nTheir first child, born in 1895, was my mother, Seck Choy Fung.\n\n\nIt is safe to hypothesize that both my father and my mother came to\nSingapore at about the same time, shortly after the turn of the century.\n\n\nEach already had their respective family ties in Singapore.\n\n\nAfter a few years here, they were introduced through a matchmaker,\nand were married in 1913.\n\n\nMy father was twenty-one years old and my mother was just eighteen.\n\n\nThey settled in a corner of my uncle's boat yard, where my father\nworked as a carpenter, living in a small wooden house with a zinc roof built\na few feet off the ground.\n\n\nThere, in quick succession over the next fourteen years, they had\nseven children: my elder sister Yue Ying ( 1915), me ( 1917), my second\nsister Yue Mei ( 1918), my brother Yat Wing ( 1920), my third sister Yue Qun\n( 1923), my fourth sister Yue Lian ( 1926) and my fifth sister Yue Xian (\n1927).\n\n\nOur childhood was spent playing barefoot around the half-finished\nhulls in the boat yard.\n\n\nWe had the sand and we had the sea and we had each other.\n\n\nI don't remember feeling poor or particularly deprived, although I do\nknow that when my third sister had a serious case of worms, she was taken to\nthe Poor People's Hospital, so financially we must have been quite poor.\n\n\nBy today's standards, our home would be considered very crowded.\n\n\nThere were only two rooms.\n\n\nMy mother and five sisters shared the bedroom ( three on a bed, three\non the floor, on a piece of linoleum which was added later), while my father,\nmy brother and I would use the living room to sleep in, setting up our\nfolding canvas cots every night.\n\n\nI never remembered my mother complaining, although she must have felt\nvery pressured and unhappy sometimes.\n\n\nOne of my earliest memories is of mother threatening to commit\nsuicide.\n\n\nShe must have been offended by her children or our father.\n\n\nOn one dark evening, in front of the house, she said she wanted to\nkill herself by jumping into the sea.\n\n\nI was scared and cried, and clung to her legs.\n\n\nThis lasted a few minutes.\n\n\nFinally, she went back to the house.\n\n\nUp to this day, I don't know how seriously she meant it.\n\n\nI think I was four or five years old then.\n\n\nMy mother did all the cooking but my father did the shopping, perhaps\nbecause he wanted to have sole control of the money, and also perhaps because\nhe simply enjoyed it.\n\n\nEvery morning, my father went to the main ( and only) road of Tanjong\nRhu, to do the marketing.\n\n\nI have fond memories of my father holding onto my hand as we walked\naround the marketplace.\n\n\nThe hawkers brought their vegetables, seafood, and meat in baskets\nand laid them out along the roadside for the customers to buy.\n\n\nIn addition to those fresh foods, some cooked food was also served by\nhawkers, mainly for the workers as breakfast.\n\n\nOne of the food hawkers was our seventh grandaunt, whom I remember\nvery well.\n\n\nShe sold rice congee with gingko nuts.\n\n\nThe eldest and most senior member of the Ho Clan, she was a tiny\nfigure under five feet, weighing possibly eighty to eighty-five pounds, but\nshe always looked dignified.\n\n\nEven much later, when she was old and wrinkled at eighty, she was\nactive and agile, looking after a large group of grand and great-grand\nchildren.\n\n\nShe was ten years older than my mother and yet outlived my mother.\n\n\nDuring her old age, she still came to my mother's home every Chinese\nNew Year to pay an annual visit.\n\n\nOn these occasions, I always gave her a red packet of two hundred\ndollars, knowing that she needed the money for her large brood.\n\n\nOn January 6, 1982, she gave me a red packet containing two dollars\nthrough my mother with a blessing for my good luck and good health.\n\n\nThat same year, she finally passed away at the age of ninety-seven.\n\n\nI still treasure the red packet of two dollars from her, and keep it\ncarefully in the locked drawer of my desk at home.\n\n\nOur second uncle was the second eldest of my father's five brothers.\n\n\nHe was an opium smoker and he must have come to Singapore at an early\nage.\n\n\nI visited him for the first time at the workers' dormitory of a\nfamily friend's boat yard.\n\n\nI had to walk up three flights of rickety wooden stairs to see him.\n\n\nHe was smoking opium inside a little room.\n\n\nI have only vague recollections of him now.\n\n\nI do not know what he was doing at the boat yard.\n\n\nThe third uncle was the father of Fuon Gor who is seventy-three or\nseventy-four by now.\n\n\nI remember this third uncle as a big, tall and husky man, who\ncommanded the respect of all his workers.\n\n\nHe was a heavy drinker.\n\n\nAs my father's older brother, he placed my father as an apprentice in\nhis boat yard, and built our house next to it.\n\n\nThis was where my father learned his trade as a boat builder.\n\n\nThird Uncle died at the age of only fifty-nine or sixty of some sort\nof liver trouble, most likely as a result of his drinking.\n\n\nOf his wife I don't recall much.\n\n\nBut when I grew much older, I learned from my mother and sisters,\nthat she was quite a mean woman, always picking on my mother in trivial\nmatters, complaining, for example, that my mother's children were scavengers,\nand picking up too many nails from the ground of her husband's shipyard.\n\n\nShe had one daughter and one son.\n\n\nMy youngest sister was once adopted by her, but she could not stomach\nit and ran back home after a short while.\n\n\n( This is why my youngest sister was not in the family picture taken\nbefore I went to China to study).\n\n\nAnd so my boyhood years were spent in the shipyard at Tanjong Rhu,\nwithin a poor but hardworking and loving family.\n\n\nIt was only when I reached school-going age, at seven, that my world\nexpanded beyond this, out towards the city district of Singapore.\n\n\nSince there was no school in Tanjong Rhu, I was sent to the city of\nSingapore to attend school.\n\n\nThe school chosen for me was Yang Zheng Chinese School.\n\n\nIt was located at today's Club Street, and was the logical school for\nme to go to, since it was a Cantonese school, using Cantonese as the medium\nof instruction.\n\n\nIn addition, my maternal grandfather was one of the directors of the\nSchool, and his second son, who was two years older than I, was already\nattending school there.\n\n\nSince it was impossible for me to commute from Tanjong Rhu to school\nevery day, I was made to stay with my maternal grandfather.\n\n\nHe had already made a name for himself, at least among the Cantonese\ncircle, and was considered well to do.\n\n\nHe was a contractor responsible for painting ships with Keppel\nShipyard.\n\n\nIn those years, contractors like my maternal grandfather could, and\napparently did, make a small fortune by bribing the British supervisor.\n\n\nFor instance, when there was a painting job to be done, the\ncontractor would report a work force of seventy men when he actually hired\nonly fifty or sixty.\n\n\nThe difference in wages was presumably shared with the British\nsupervisor.\n\n\nMy maternal grandfather's house was across the road from Keppel\nShipyard in an area which is probably Telok Blangah now.\n\n\nIt was then a hill with a paved road leading to the hilltop, where\nnice brick bungalows housed the yard's British staff.\n\n\nMy grandfather's house was the last one of a row of seven or eight\nterrace houses on the slope.\n\n\nThe terrace house next door was leased to an Indian.\n\n\nHe must have been one of the contractors to Keppel Shipyard, for\nevery day at lunch time there would be thirty to forty Indian workers having\ntheir lunch in front of the house.\n\n\nThey ate the same thing everyday: white rice with curry and a single\nsmall potato.\n\n\nThe two-storey terrace house I moved into was a typical one of the\nold days.\n\n\nThe entrance led directly into a living room, which in turn opened\nout into an open atrium at the centre of the house.\n\n\nOn the other side of the atrium was a dining room, a kitchen and a\ntoilet.\n\n\nMy grandfather's household consisted of quite a number of people.\n\n\nHe had three wives, which was not unusual in those days.\n\n\nHis first wife, my grandmother, did not live there.\n\n\nShe had given birth to my mother in China, and then come to\nSingapore, where she bore another girl, my aunt Yue Yi, fifteen years younger\nthan my mother.\n\n\nMy grandmother apparently could not stand the second wife's\nbossiness, so she eventually left Singapore and returned to China.\n\n\nThis second wife, whom we called Small Grandmother, was a little fat\nwoman.\n\n\nShe was the mistress of the household.\n\n\nThe mere fact that she bore two sons, Ze Ling and Pak Ling,\nnaturally meant that she could usurp the first wife's place to assume the\nrole of mistress in the household. \n\n\nThe third wife, whom we called the Third Grandmother, was a tragic\nfigure and had no say whatsoever in the household, because she came from a\nlow status in society.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

Anthurium andreanum\n\n\n2) Caladium - Caladium spp\n\n\n3) Elephant's Ear Plant - Colocasia spp\n\n\n4) Dumbcane - Dieffenbachia spp\n\n\n5) Money plant - Epipremnum aureum\n\n\n6) Fishtail Palm - Caryota mitis\n\n\n Irritant raphides \n\n\nAnthurium andreanum - Linden Flamingo Lily ( Fig 1).\n\n\nAn attractive and popular flowering herb, the plant is commonly\nplanted for its ornamental value.\n\n\nThe narrowly erect, pale yellowish flowering head is subtended by a\nshowy red, pink or white spathe.\n\n\nCaladium spp - Caladium ( Fig 2).\n\n\nThese are attractive foliage plants with simple, heart-shaped leaves\nwhich are often beautifully marked with red, white or other colours.\n\n\nColocasia spp - Elephant's Ear Plant ( Fig 3).\n\n\nThese plants are large herbs native to Asia.\n\n\nLeaves are large, simple and heart-shaped.\n\n\nThey are planted for the attractive foliage or for the edible tubers.\n\n\nDieffenbachia spp - Dumbcane ( See p 26).\n\n\nThis is a group of attractive foliage plants commonly planted in pots\nfor indoor decorations or in landscapes outdoors.\n\n\nThe large simple leaves are variously variegated.\n\n\nScindapsus aureus Engl - Money Plant ( See p 52).\n\n\nThese plants are commonly placed indoors in containers of water where\nthey can survive for long periods without exposure to the sun or fertiliser\napplications.\n\n\nIt is a creeper with simple, heart-shaped leaves which are green with\nyellow variegations.\n\n\nWhen grown in the ground it can develop into a large vine.\n\n\nCaryota mitis Lour - Fishtail Palm ( Fig 4).\n\n\nThis palm is easily recognised by the twice compound leaves and the\nfishtail-like leaflets.\n\n\nA palm of the secondary forests of the region, it is commonly used to\nline the wayside.\n\n\nThe tissues contain needle like crystals which can cause intense\nirritation.\n\n\n CONTACT URTICARIA ( CONTACT DERMATITIS) \n\n\nThis is caused by coming in contact with the minute stinging hairs of\nplants or irritant sap.\n\n\nImmediately after contact there will be itching of the skin\naccompanied by redness, which may be followed by wheal and flare response (\nFigs.\n\n\n5 & 6), ie swelling at the site and fluid collection in the skin.\n\n\nThe itching may continue for a few hours and usually passes away.\n\n\nAllamanda cathartica L - Common Allamanda ( Fig 7).\n\n\nA medium-sized shrub planted for the large, attractive, yellow\nflowers, the plant oozes a milky latex when any parts are broken.\n\n\nNative to tropical America and widely planted as an ornamental, the\nCommon Allamanda is easily recognised by its showy flowers, simple leaves\narranged in opposite pairs or in whorls and the white latex.\n\n\nA dwarf cultivar is now popularly planted in gardens.\n\n\nNerium oleander L - Oleander ( See p 46).\n\n\nThis is a tall shrub with narrow, pointed, simple leaves arranged in\nwhorls of threes.\n\n\nFlowers are showy and arranged in terminal clusters, varying from\nyellowish to rose-pink, red-purple or white.\n\n\nAll parts of the plant contain a watery sap.\n\n\nThe plant is now popularly planted in gardens.\n\n\nAnanas comosus ( L.) Merr - Pineapple ( Fig 8).\n\n\nThe pineapple is a tropical American plant widely planted throughout\nthe tropics for the succulent fruits.\n\n\nHowever, isolated plants may be grown in pots or gardens for their\nornamental value.\n\n\nThere are also a few colourful cultivars that are commonly grown.\n\n\nThe plant is easily reconised by the spirally arranged leaves which\nare stiff, long, sword-like and tipped with a sharp spine.\n\n\nFlowers are in a compact head developing into a fleshy fruit bearing\na prominent crown of leaves at the top.\n\n\nRhoeo spathacea ( Swartz) Stearn - Purple Queen ( Fig 9).\n\n\nThis erect herb is an attractive foliage plant native to tropical\nAmerica.\n\n\nIt is easily recognised by its many long, narrow leaves which are\ndark green on the upper surface and purple on the lower.\n\n\nFlowers are small, white and enclosed within pairs of boat-shaped\nbracts found at the base of the plant.\n\n\nChrysanthemum spp - Chrysanthemum ( Fig 10).\n\n\nThese are basically grown as ornamentals as the flowers are large and\nshowy.\n\n\nWith colours varying from yellow, red, purple, pink, orange to white.\n\n\nThe plant is a low herb and often aromatic.\n\n\nRicinus communis L - Castor Oil Plant ( See p 51).\n\n\nThis is a small tree or a large shrub with leaves like those of the\npapaya's.\n\n\nThe plant may be planted as an ornamental because of the attractive\nfoliage, but beware, the seeds are highly poisonous.\n\n\nGrevillea robusta A Cunn - Silk Oak Tree ( Fig 11).\n\n\nThis is an uncommon wayside tree of Australian origin.\n\n\nA nunber of fine specimens can still be seen in various locations in\nSingapore.\n\n\nIt can be recognised by the feathery leaves which are dull green on\nthe upper surface and silky white below.\n\n\n Irritant sap or latex \n\n\nPlumeria spp - Frangipani ( Fig 12).\n\n\nThis is an attractive medium-sized tree with stout, soft branches\nand an abundance of white latex.\n\n\nLeaves are simple and large and flowers are showy and variously\ncoloured.\n\n\nEuphorbia tirucalli L - Pencil Cactus ( Fig 13).\n\n\nThis succulent is easily recognised by the green, pencil-like\nbranches and the minute leaves which drop off at an early stage.\n\n\nWhen a part of the plant is broken, copious white latex oozes out.\n\n\nEuphorbia milii Desmoul - Crown-of-Thorns ( Fig 14).\n\n\nThe plant is a spiny shrub commonly grown in pots for the attractive\nbright red or yellow, paired flowering bracts.\n\n\nThe stems are slender and very spiny.\n\n\nAll parts of the plant has a white latex which oozes out when\ndamaged.\n\n\nExcoecaria agallocha L - Buta Buta ( See p 32).\n\n\nA medium-sized tree found along the fringe of mangrove areas, the\nwhite latex is extremely poisonous and capable of blinding the eye, thus the\ncommon name.\n\n\nPedilanthus tithymaloides ( L.) Poit - Devil's Backbone ( Fig 15).\n\n\nA common and attractive foliage plant, the Devil's Backbone is so\nnamed because of its zig-zag stem.\n\n\nThe simple, yellow and green leaves are arranged in two rows along\nthe stem.\n\n\nAll parts of the plant contain a white latex.\n\n\n PHOTODERMATITIS ( PHYTO PHOTODERMATITIS) \n\n\nSome individuals will become sensitive to ultraviolet rays in the\nsunlight after exposure to certain plants.\n\n\nThese plants contain a substance known as psoralens ( furocoumarins)\nin the sap which can enter into the skin especially when it is moist.\n\n\nIf the skin is subsequently exposed to sunlight it will become\nreddish, appearing like sunburn, sometimes with severe reactions such as skin\neruptions and bullae formation ( Fig 16).\n\n\nThe plants which can produce photodermatitis are: Ficus pumila L -\nCreeping Fig ( Fig 17).\n\n\nThe plant is a vine creeping by means of the numerous roots arising\nfrom the stem.\n\n\nIt is commonly grown to cover walls of buildings, overhead bridges\nand other structures.\n\n\nThe leaves are small and simple.\n\n\nFruits are pear-shaped figs arising from erect branches.\n\n\nAll parts of the plant contain a white latex.\n\n\nCitrus aurantiifolia ( Christm.) - Swingle Lime.\n\n\nThe Lime is a spiny shrub with elliptic-oval leaves which are\nnarrowly winged along the stalk.\n\n\nFlowers are small and white, oval, greenish yellow and acid.\n\n\n ALLERGIC CONTACT DERMATITIS \n\n\nThis clinical condition occurs following repeated contact with the\nplant and is an allergic phenomenon.\n\n\nThe sensitising substance from the plants reacts with protein in the\nskin to form the antigen.\n\n\nOnce this antigen is formed, there will be a lag period of one to\nthree weeks during which immunological changes in the body and the skin take\nplace.\n\n\nOnce the sensitivity has been established, subsequent contact with\nthese plant substances will produce skin reactions ranging from mild erythema\nto blisters, crusting and scaling very shortly after the contact.\n\n\nThe plants which can cause allergic contact dermatitis are:\nAnacardium occidentale L - Cashew-nut Tree ( see p 8).\n\n\nThis tropical American tree is occasionally encountered in Singapore\nand recognised by its characteristic kidney-shaped nuts.\n\n\nThe edible succulent receptacle from which the nut rises turns\nbright red or yellow with maturity.\n\n\nThe sap from all parts of the plant is poisonous and irritates the\nskin.\n\n\nMangifera indica L - Mango ( Fig 18).\n\n\nThis attractive fruit tree is commonly planted in gardens, giving\nregular flushes of copperish young leaves.\n\n\nFlowering occurs twice a year when the entire crown is covered with\npinkish white flowers.\n\n\nFruits are variously shaped according to the cultivars, green\nturning yellow.\n\n\nAll parts of the plant contain a brownish sap which can result in\nallergic contact dermatitis. \n\n\n\n\n Plant Around Us \n\n\n Plants and Their Differences \n\n\n1) Plants are living things.\n\n\nThey grow, reproduce and respond to changes.\n\n\n2) They also need food, air and water to survive.\n\n\n3) There are many different kinds of plants around us.\n\n\n4) Plants can differ from each other in the places where they grow.\n\n\nThey can grow in drains, on walls, roofs and even on other plants.\n\n\nThey are also different from each other in their plant parts such as\nthe stems, leaves, flowers and fruits.\n\n\n Differences In Stems \n\n\n1) Trees have strong, woody stems that can grow very tall. \n\n\nThese are called trunks.\n\n\nBranches grow from the trunks.\n\n\n2) The tree trunk and its branches are protected by a covering\ncalled bark.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '69936777-ba2e-4efc-b360-8ca37afec97d', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.764512+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9338142275810242, 'non_english_score': 0.06618577241897583}
{'text': 'THE CORALS OF THE FAMILY AGARICIDAE \n\n\nby Jeffrey Low and L M Chou\n\n\nThe agaricid corals form a small part of the large number of\nreef-building corals.\n\n\nOf the six genera found world-wide, three are very common in local\nwaters, namely Pavona, Leptoseris, and Pachyseris.\n\n\nThese corals may be boulder-shaped ( massive) or encrusting, or more\ncommonly laminar ( plate-like) or foliaceous ( leaf-like).\n\n\nThey are common on protected reef slopes and in lagoons.\n\n\nThe genus Pazona can be differentiated from the other two by the\npresence of corallites on both sides of the plate ( bifacial).\n\n\nThe corallites are inter-connected by thick plate-like walls called\nsepto-costae.\n\n\nPavona species are usually found on the upper reef slopes.\n\n\nSome of the species are capable of attaining large dimensions, for\nexample Pavona cactus, which can grow to 10 metres in diameter in turbid\nwaters.\n\n\nThis species has thin, contorted and upright fronds, which are pale\nor greenish brown in colour.\n\n\nTogether with another species, Pavona decussata, whose colonies have\nthick, inter-connecting laminae, they are known to harbour various species of\nporcellanid ( Porcellana sp.) and hairy ( Pilumnus sp.) crabs.\n\n\nGrowth form and colour variation in this genus can be quite varied.\n\n\nPavona explanulata for instance, has colonies that are encrusting or\nhas thin laminae, but it may sometimes be submissive or columnar.\n\n\nThis species is distinguished by a distinct column called the\ncolumellae rising from the centre of the corallite.\n\n\nAlso, the polyps extend their tentacles during the day, and the\ncolour of the colonies may range from grey, brown, pink, purple, green,\nyellow to mottled.\n\n\nIn Pavona clavus, the growth form may be columnar, laminar, or both.\n\n\nThis species is found mainly on the upper reef slopes that are\nexposed to currents.\n\n\nColonies of Leptoseris can usually be found on the lower reefslopes,\nunder overhangs or in the openings of caverns, and also on lagoon floors and\non the ocean floor between reefs.\n\n\nThe corallites are found only on one face of the colony ( unifacial),\nand are separated by irregular ridges.\n\n\nLeptoseris explanata has laminae that are either lobed or entire, and\nmay be contorted or partly upright.\n\n\nThe corallites are widely spaced and facing outward, and the\nsepto-costae form conspicuous radiating ridges.\n\n\nThe colonies are pale or yellow brown with white margins.\n\n\nLeptoseris scabra is encrusting and is highly contorted, sometimes\nforming hollow columns and tubes or fronds.\n\n\nThe corallites are not outwardly inclined, and the colonies are\ncoloured dull grey or brown green with white margins.\n\n\nColonies of Pachyseris are similar to Leptoseris, being laminar and\nunifacial, but the plates are highly contorted, with concentric ridges\nrunning parallel to the edge.\n\n\nThe colonies may also be branching.\n\n\nThe corallite centres are not distinct, and there has been no record\nof extended polyps being seen in the day or night.\n\n\nOnly two species have so far been found in Singapore.\n\n\nPachyseris rugosa has upright and contorted plates, and may be\ncoloured deep bluish grey or brown.\n\n\nThe colonies have been reported to grow to eight metres in diameter\nin shallow turbid waters.\n\n\nPachyseris speciosa, on the other hand, may grow in a wide range of\nhabitats, but usually does not exceed two metres in diameter.\n\n\nIt is pale brown to deep grey, and is laminate, although upright\nridges and columns may develop. \n\n\n\n\n A Guide To Freshwater Life in Singapore \n\n\nedited by Peter K L Ng\n\n\nIn 1981, the Singapore Science Centre released the first in its\nguidebook series - A GUIDE TO POND LIFE, written by R S Bhathal and T S Foo.\n\n\nSince then, 16 guides have been released, and the standard of the\nbooks has been improving ever since.\n\n\nOver 30,000 books have been sold, and it is still the most useful\nreference for school children studying freshwater life in Singapore.\n\n\nThe present book endeavours to update as well as expand the scope of\nthat book.\n\n\nWhile every attempt has been made to ensure the accuracy of the text,\nI accept the onus for any mistakes which may have slipped through.\n\n\nI am also grateful to Professor Anne Johnson for writing the\nforeword.\n\n\nHer husband, the late Professor Desmond S Johnson, was one of the\nmost respected limnologists in this region.\n\n\nThe credits for the various sections are as follows:\n\n\nFreshwater Fungi -

These are usually in areas which have\nbeen developed and include agricultural land and large bodies of water.\n\n\nThese include: Ponds, lakes and reservoirs; monsoon canals and\ndrains; rural streams and riverine habitats.\n\n\nThe water in these habitats is generally eutrophic ( high levels of\norganic matter and nutrients); not very clear due to suspended silt, soil\nparticles and phytoplankton; almost neutral to only slightly acidic or\nalkaline ( pH 6-8); and only moderately hard ( ie with some dissolved salts\nlike calcium and bicarbonates).\n\n\nThe water in the raw water reservoirs are generally cleaner.\n\n\nForest Fresh Waters - Ponds; shallow streams and freshwater swamps.\n\n\nThe water in forest areas are generally oligotrophic ( low levels of\norganic matter and nutrients); relatively clear ( unless disturbed) ( with\nvery little phytoplankton); acidic to highly acidic ( pH 1-6 and very soft (\nie with almost no dissolved salts).\n\n\nThe freshwater environment in Singapore is less complex than that of\nits neighbours owing to the relatively small land area, and the absence of\nany significantly large freshwater riverine systems.\n\n\nThe objective of this book is to provide readers, especially school\nchildren and undergraduates with a reference to the more common organisms\nwhich may be found by a reasonably observant person.\n\n\nTo expand the scope of the original book on POND LIFE, we have\nincluded the flora and fauna of forest streams as well.\n\n\n THE CHEMISTRY OF FRESH WATER \n\n\nIt is well known that fresh waters constitute only a miniscule part\nof the water on earth.\n\n\nOf this, about 2.15% is unavailable, frozen up as ice, mainly in the\nNorth and South Poles.\n\n\nThe oceans and seas constitute a staggering 7.3% of all our water\nsupply.\n\n\nExcluding the inland saline lakes, soil moisture and water vapour;\nonly about 0.6% of the water is fresh water; and most of this is underground.\n\n\nAll the surface lakes, ponds, reservoirs, rivers and streams contain\nonly 0.009% of the total water.\n\n\nThe chemical content of fresh water is often misunderstood.\n\n\nFresh water is not always free of dissolved matter.\n\n\nIn fact, it may often have much more dissolved salts that equivalent\nseawater.\n\n\nThe distinction lies in the fact that seawater or the marine habitat\ncontains much more sodium, potassium and chloride ions.\n\n\nWhile many freshwaters often have a relatively high\ncarbonate-bicarbonate component.\n\n\nThis is not the case in tropical areas where waters may become very\nacidic.\n\n\nFresh water in general has a pH ( acid-alkaline scale) ranging from\n4.4 to 8.6 ( in sharp contrast to the 7.8 to 8.3 of seawater).\n\n\nThe fresh water habitat, to dispel the " myth" that it is a\nhomogenous habitat, it is in fact, very heterogenous.\n\n\nThe problems of osmoregulation are well known; and it is not just\nconfined to too much water entering the organism.\n\n\nTo achieve a fine balance in salts often poses greater problems.\n\n\nIn Singapore fresh waters, temperatures during the day rarely exceed\n35@C ( surface) even in open areas; and usually do not drop lower than 25@C\neven in shaded forested areas at night.\n\n\nAt most times, temperatures range between 25.5 and 28@C.\n\n\nThe depth of the waters vary, but nowhere does very deep water occur.\n\n\nFlowing waters rarely exceed two metres in depth during normal times,\nbut during monsoons, depths easily reach three metres.\n\n\nIn general, the depth increases as the waters flow closer to the sea,\nbecoming more brackish and subjected to tidal influences.\n\n\nThe completely freshwater reservoirs like Seletar, MacRitchie and\nPeirce have depths of about 10 m or so.\n\n\nOur waters are generally turbid, and at depths of three or four\nmetres, almost all the light has been absorbed.\n\n\nOxygen levels in general are high, exceeding 50% in cool forest areas\nwith flowing water.\n\n\nIn areas with dense submerged or aquatic vegetation, oxygen\nsaturation may even exceed 150% under strong sunlight because of\nphotosynthesis.\n\n\nAt night however, the oxygen levels in these areas become severely\ndepleted due to plant respiration; sometimes falling below 10% saturation.\n\n\nThis can lead to mass mortality of fish life due to asphyxiation.\n\n\nExtreme habitats are not uncommonly found.\n\n\nThe waters of a monsoon drain are such an environment.\n\n\nDirect sunlight, open terrain with little cover, polluted waters\nwith high ion and organic content, torrential water during rains etc all pose\ntremendous challenges.\n\n\nIn such habitats, native animals tend to fare very badly.\n\n\nAnother " extreme habitat" is a freshwater swamp forest, where the\nwater sometimes gets so peaty ( laden with tannins and humic acids) that it\nbecomes brownish and highly acidic ( pH 5.5 or less) - a condition\nlimnologists term " blackwater".\n\n\nInterestingly, many exotic and beautiful native fishes and prawns\nsurvive in these stale or slow-flowing shallow waters with high acid levels\nand large amounts of decaying vegetation.\n\n\n HOW TO USE THIS BOOK \n\n\nThe present book treats the flora and fauna in a taxonomic way.\n\n\nThe number of groups of organisms of both plant and animal covered\nin this book make it very difficult to have a " standardised" presentation.\n\n\nThe term " freshwater" is used as a adjective, eg freshwater\nhabitat, freshwater organism, freshwater fish, freshwater prawn etc.\n\n\nWhen the water itself is discussed, we use the term fresh water" as\na noun instead.\n\n\nIt is extremely important to note that the names published here are\nto be used by the layman carefully.\n\n\nThis is especially so when species names are given.\n\n\nWe have chosen what we believe are generally common species; but in\nsome places, other similar looking species may dominate.\n\n\nIdentifications to genus, family and orders can be more reliable (\nin that order).\n\n\nWe are still a long way before we have precise names for many of our\naquatic animals and even further from understanding their often complex\necology and general biology.\n\n\nSome of the scientific names used here ( especially in water plants)\nwill differ somewhat from what has been published.\n\n\nChanges here have been necessitated by revisions and corrections of\nold mistakes.\n\n\nThe original guidebook on pond life was designed for younger school\nchildren.\n\n\nHence, a minimum of jargon, technical and scientific names was used.\n\n\nIn the last ten years however, education standards have risen\nsharply, and students in general, expect more.\n\n\nThe present book has now been conceived to suit students up to the\nundergraduate level.\n\n\nConsequently, we have tried our best to achieve a " tricky balance"\n- a text that is easily understood pleasant to read and yet, " respectable".\n\n\nSome of the more basic aspects have been omitted.  There has been\nan intended " bias" towards the plants and water insects in this book because\nthese have been poorly or inadequately dealt with in other books.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '6cf5d379-53e6-46c9-9dc5-81798621555c', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.765627+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9521840214729309, 'non_english_score': 0.04781597852706909}
{'text': 'TRILOBITE LARVAE \n\n\nby Peter K L Ng and H S Yong\n\n\nBiologists recognise a term called NEOTENY, which is used to describe\nan animal which retains all its juvenile features even when it has grown to a\nlarge size and is sexually mature.\n\n\nIn layman\'s language, neotenic animals can perhaps be described as "\nmature overgrown babies"!\n\n\nIn the insect world, one of the most dramatic and best known cases of\nneoteny occurs in some members of the beetle family Lycidae.\n\n\nBeetles ( Order Coleoptera) are the most diverse living things on this\nplanet, and there are more beetle species than any other group of animals.\n\n\nIt is thus not surprising that some beetles have adopted a very\npeculiar strategy to survive in the extremely competitive rainforest.\n\n\nIt is well known that beetle larvae and pupae look very different from\nthe adult.\n\n\nMore often than not, they look more like worms or caterpillars,\nalthough all possess the six segmented legs characteristic of insects.\n\n\nThey are also exceptionally diverse in their habits and habitats.\n\n\nThe males of all members of the family Lycidae are typical beetles,\npossessing the hardened outer wings, membranous inner wings for flying and\nall the general features.\n\n\nThe females of some lycids on the other hand, never seem to " grow\nup".\n\n\nThat is, unlike males, these female larvae keep on growing without\nmetamorphosising to pupae and then to the normal adult.\n\n\nThey also become very large ( up to 6 cm long), sexually mature and\ncapable of reproducing!\n\n\nThe male of these lycid beetles on the other hand, are very small - -\nonly about 0.5 cm in body length.\n\n\nIn one of the most extraordinary copulations in nature, a male mates\nwith a female totally different from himself and some 12 times his size (\nmany more times in bulk)!\n\n\nThe female lycid larvae have in fact been known to biologists for\nalmost 160 years, when these larvae were made known to science by an English\nentomologist named Perty.\n\n\nThe animal was so unusual that Perty described it as \'larva\nsingularis\' - - the remarkable larva.\n\n\nHis colleagues meanwhile, did him the dubious honour by calling the\nanimals \'Perty\'s larvae\'!\n\n\nWhile the six legs of \'Perty\'s larva\' necessitated its classification\nin the Class Insecta, little else could be deduced.\n\n\nFlightless, large and peculiar in almost every respect, even studies\nof live animals imported into Europe defied attempts by biologists to better\nunderstand them.\n\n\nWhile entomologists were confident that it was the larva of some\ninsect, probably a beetle, no one could confidently associate it with any\nknown family.\n\n\nAmidst this intrigue, some English entomologists coined the name \'trilobite\nlarvae\' for these animals, alluding to the general similarity of some kinds\nof these larvae to the extinct and totally unrelated trilobites.\n\n\nThis name has remained in popular use ever since.\n\n\nOnly in 1924 was the mystery of the \'trilobite larvae\' solved - - by\na Swede explorer, Eric Mjoberg.\n\n\nMjoberg showed that \'trilobite larvae\' were all females, and were\ncapable of reproducing.\n\n\nSome of his animals actually laid eggs, which he recorded as being as\nlarge as sago grains and up to 400 in number.\n\n\nHe postulated that the male might well be something very different\nfrom the female and perhaps even capable of flight.\n\n\nAfter nearly 2 years of doggedly trying to find the males in the\nrainforests of Sarawak, Borneo, he finally managed to observe and collect\nthem, using the female \'trilobite larvae\' as bait!\n\n\nAnd as expected, males were typical beetles.\n\n\nIn Malaysia, we have seen large, non-feeding females perched almost\nmotionless on branches and dead wood, apparently waiting for prospective\nmates in the middle of the night.\n\n\nSo it seems, at least in some Lycidae, males and females adopt\ncompletely different modes of life to maximise their chances of survival in\nthe forest.\n\n\nFor females to be large makes a lot of biological sense - - for one\nthing, she can produce more eggs.\n\n\nThese lycids have gone to the extreme to achieve this, with their\nfemales retaining their larval features all the way to adulthood.\n\n\nNot only have they grown very large in comparison to the males, they\nhave also lost the ability to fly, directing all their energies, presumably,\nto reproduction instead.\n\n\n\'Trilobite larvae\' are known from Southeast Asia, including Malaysia\nand Singapore, and come in many shapes, forms and sizes.\n\n\nThe taxonomy and identification of \'trilobite larvae\' are very\ndifficult.\n\n\nOne of the better known species is the appropriately named Duliticola\nparadoxa, the one studied in detail by Mjoberg.\n\n\nPublished sources indicate that at least two other beetle families\nhave larviform females, the Lampyridae ( fireflies) and Drilidae.\n\n\nIn these two families however, the females metamorphose from normal\npupae into flightless adults which lack both sets of wings.\n\n\nThey are hence not truly neotenic.\n\n\nThe lycid \'trilobite larvae\' do not undergo a pupal stage and have a\ndifferent and more \'larval\' body form.\n\n\nLarge and flightless, \'trilobite larvae\' defend themselves by\nsecreting a whitish foul-tasting fluid to discourage potential predators.\n\n\nTheir heads are telescopic, and can be protruded during feeding or\nretracted if disturbed.\n\n\nAt the rear of their body, they have a suction pad.\n\n\nAs far as is known, they feed on rotten wood ( according to Mjoberg),\nor more likely, on small animals or fungi in the wood.\n\n\nMjoberg reported that he could keep his animals alive for many months\nwith a continuous supply of rotten wood and " ...bathed twice a day"!\n\n\nWe have found specimens on fungi ( Basidiomycetes), and it is\npossible that some species are fungivores.\n\n\nThe suction pad of a \'trilobite larva\' is able to attach itself to\nsmooth and rough surfaces, and helps anchor the animal.\n\n\nCertainly, Mjoberg reported collecting many from among rotten wood.\n\n\nWe have observed some of them apparently grazing on the fungal\ngrowths on rotting wood.\n\n\nMany of our specimens have been found on rotting hardwoods.\n\n\nThe wood is damp and termites are not very common.\n\n\nThey are mainly nocturnal, and usually move about only after dusk.\n\n\nThey have however, been observed moving around during the day on\ngrass or mossy patches after rain or during the wetter parts of the year.\n\n\nThere has also been a report that they feed on land snails ( D H\nMurphy and Kwan Hun, " An Eye on Nature", Maruzen Publishers, 1983); using\ntheir suction pads to attach themselves onto the shell of their prey, their\ntelescopic heads pursuing the snail even if it retreated into its shell.\n\n\nIf this is indeed the case, then the feeding habits of \'trilobite\nlarvae\' will parallel those of the better known glow-worms, the larvae of\nfireflies.\n\n\nIn the laboratory however, we have not been able to persuade our\ncaptive specimens to eat snails of the genera Dyakia or Achatina.\n\n\n\'Paddy\' Murphy has kindly informed one of us ( P Ng) that the large\nspecimen on which he based his report on was collected from Peninsular\nMalaysia many years ago, and the collector had informed him that it fed on\nsnails.\n\n\nThe specimen ( not the same one figured in his book) was brought back\nto Malaysia by the collector.\n\n\nOn retrospect, he suggests that the snail-feeding animal might well\nhave been a very large glow-worm and not a true \'trilobite larva\' ( pers\ncomm).\n\n\nThe same can perhaps be said for another report that the larvae of\nsome Lycidae have " ...along the margins...a string of luminous organs which\nflash on and off, signaling in a predetermined code.\n\n\nThe light produced is weak, cold light...\n\n\nThe larvae are predaceous and are found on foliage and tree trunks in\nopen woods".\n\n\n( Vincent Tung, " Common Malaysian Beetles", Malaysian Nature\nHandbooks, Longman, 1983:, p.\n\n\n80).\n\n\nWe have never observed bioluminescence in \'trilobite larvae\' from\nSingapore or Malaysia, and neither are there any reports of this.\n\n\nThese observations are more likely to refer to the Lampyridae!\n\n\nNeither are \'trilobite larvae\' known to be carnivorous, which\nlampyrids are known to be.\n\n\n\'Trilobite larvae \' , in our experience, prefer more wooded, forested\nareas, and do not climb more than two metres above the ground, and not on\nleaves.\n\n\nA \'trilobite larva\' is very dorso-ventrally flattened.\n\n\nThe ventral surface of Duliticola, showing the six legs which\nidentify it as an insect.\n\n\nThe body form of Duliticola, with its armour-plate-like segments and\nprojections, superficially resembles that of the ancient and now extinct\nmarine trilobites, hence its popular name.\n\n\n\'Trilobite larvae\' are popular collector\'s items, and are much sought\nafter by coleopterists.\n\n\nTheir secretive habits however, render them generally uncommon in\nMalaysia and Singapore.\n\n\nThere is however, still a great deal we do not know about lycid\nbeetles and their \'trilobite larvae\'.\n\n\nMatching the many kinds of beetle-like males is very difficult unless\nthey have been observed copulating.\n\n\nThis involves a great deal of field work and perseverance.\n\n\nAs a result, a stable taxonomy for \'trilobite larvae\' is still not\npossible.\n\n\nMany of the questions posed by Mjoberg remain unanswered.\n\n\nIn many ways \'trilobite larvae\' are still very much a mystery, as\nthey were over 160 years ago.\n\n\nAnother form for \'trilobite larva\' ( Duliticola sp.) from Mount\nKinabalu in Sabah.\n\n\nIt can be encountered during the day at the Park Headquarters.\n\n\nThe males of \'trilobite larvae\' are typical beetles in every respect,\nin sharp contrast to their neotenic females.\n\n\nThese two species of unidentified male lycid beatles resemble the\nknown males of \'trilobite larvae\'.\n\n\nIt must be emphasised that not all female lycid beetles are \'trilobite\nlarvae\' - - many are typical beatles too.\n\n\nAcknowledgements.\n\n\n- - Thanks are due to Dr Damir Kovac for

\n\n\nNow to species: You are most likely to catch bonnethead or nurse\nsharks, both of which are strong, but of little danger to life and limb.\n\n\nThe bonnethead is like a baby hammerhead.\n\n\nIt averages about 7-lbs and grows just into double figures.\n\n\nIt has proper " sharky" teeth and can give you a serious bite if you\nare lax enough to let it.\n\n\nThe nurse has an incredibly muscular torso and even a twenty pounder\ncannot be held straight.\n\n\nIt has tiny eyes, relies on smell for locating baits and has\ncrushing, rather than cutting teeth.\n\n\nIt looks somewhat like a bull huss.\n\n\nAn average nurse shark would be about thirty pounds.\n\n\nA big one, maybe seventy pounds up.\n\n\nThey grow to over 200 lbs.\n\n\nYou may also locate lemon and black tip sharks, though in all the\nyears, I have fished there, I have only had one in daylight hours.\n\n\nThey are certainly out in force at night and are true oceanic,\naggressive sharks.\n\n\nA 100 pounder would easily be capable of removing a hand but as you\nare on heavy mono traces, any meeting with one will be brief.\n\n\nShould you use wire traces, you will get less pickups in daylight\nthan mono but will stay attached to both blacktips and lemons.\n\n\nMuch of the time, you can actually see the sharks working their way\nup a scent trail as they track down on a bait.\n\n\nThis makes it exciting and the bigger nurse sharks throw up clouds\nof coral sand as they rip into a legered bait.\n\n\nThe largest I have boated would be about 90-lbs but I had a couple\nof carp guys out last April/May who took seven in a day to an estimated\n125-lbs, using standard carp gear and baitrunners.\n\n\nAssuming you are now all gung-ho for a session, let me give you a\nbreakdown of a spring trip.\n\n\nPackages are best worked out in twos.\n\n\nTwo to a room, hire car and boat break costs down to bearable\namounts.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "The Mynas ( Acridotheres spp.) of Singapore \n\n\nby Kang Nee\n\n\nThe Common Myna, Acridotheres tristis, and the White-vented Myna, A\njavanicus, are two of the most common species of birds in Singapore.\n\n\nThe Common Myna ranges from Afghanistan to Southwest China.\n\n\nIt is resident in most of Southeast Asia and has been introduced in\nmany countries, eg Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii.\n\n\nThe Common Myna was first recorded in Singapore in 1936 as it expanded\nits range southwards from Peninsular Malaysia.\n\n\nThe White-vented Myna ranges from East Pakistan to South China and is\nresident in Myanmar, Thailand, Indochina, Java and Sulawesi.\n\n\nIt was introduced locally around 1924 either deliberately or as\nescaped cage birds.\n\n\nCommon and White-vented Mynas are medium-sized birds ( total length ca\n250 mm) with overlapping distributions in Singapore.\n\n\nBoth species are abundant because urbanisation and deforestation have\ncreated suitable habitats for them, whether in the heart of the city,\nindustrial estates, or suburban housing, park or beach areas.\n\n\nThey are also numerous in the few remaining patches of rural habitat.\n\n\nHowever the two species do not occur in equal abundance: there are\npresently about three times as many White-vented Mynas as Common Mynas.\n\n\nFeeding is an important activity and occupies about 25% of a myna's\ntime budget.\n\n\nBoth species of myna are omnivorous and eat a variety of food ranging\nfrom insects and earthworms found in grass-field to food scraps.\n\n\nSome types of food may be termed ephemeral: these are temporary\nsources of food which occur in superabundance, and are usually clumped in\ndistribution.\n\n\nFor instance, a common sight is that of aggregations of mynas on a\nnewly mown field, feeding on earthworms and insects disturbed by the activity\nof the grass mowing machine and often following it.\n\n\nHeavy rain often causes waterlogging of fields, and earthworms and\nother soil fauna evacuating their flooded burrows provide another ephemeral\nsource of food.\n\n\nInsects swarm under certain environmental conditions and these swarms\nserve as transient but protein-rich source of food for mynas and other\ninsectivores.\n\n\nPlants also provide different types of ephemeral food in the form of\nnectar from flowers and fruit, whether wild ( eg figs tembusu berries) or\ncultivated ( eg papaya, banana, jambu).\n\n\nCasuarina, usually planted along the coast and beach areas, fruits\nperiodically and the exposed ovules in the ripened cones form yet another\ntemporary supply of nourishment for mynas.\n\n\nAnother example of ephemeral foods includes carrion in the form of\nthe occasional dog, cat or bird killed by motor vehicles.\n\n\nCommon and White-vented Mynas appear to have adopted different\nfeeding strategies.\n\n\nThe White-vented Myna behaves opportunistically and supplements its\nregular food sources by exploiting ephemeral foods when they are available.\n\n\nIn contrast, the Common Myna appears to be more of a specialist, and\nrelies predominantly on regular food supplies found on its home range.\n\n\nBy adopting different feeding strategies, the two species are able to\nco-exist in the same habitats in Singapore.\n\n\nIt has been suggested that the 'aggressive' mynas may have been\nresponsible for the decline of some species of birds in Singapore.\n\n\nSome studies in New Zealand and Hawaii have implicated the Common\nMyna as a predator of eggs and nestlings of some seabirds such as\nshearwaters, noddies and terns.\n\n\nCommon Mynas have also been reported to destroy the nests of some\nland birds such as warblers in New Zealand.\n\n\nHowever in Singapore, it was observed that both species of myna\nusually direct their aggression towards members of their own species.\n\n\nFights over food or nest sites involve grappling and tearing at the\nopponent with the legs and pecking.\n\n\nSometimes such fights can be fatal.\n\n\nBut both species are generally submissive when they encounter other\nspecies of birds, eg Black-naped Oriole Oriolus chinensis, Collared\nKingfisher Halcyon chloris and House Crow Corvus splendens.\n\n\nOne may often see mynas running or flying for cover when chased by\nthese birds.\n\n\n Bowing display used in courtship and pair-bonding \n\n\nMynas are reported to be monogamous and breed throughout the year.\n\n\nCourtship and pair-bonding behaviours are observed from August\nonwards, followed by nest-building and incubation from January to May.\n\n\nFledglings are often seen around June or July.\n\n\nMynas nest in holes and are catholic in their choice of sites, eg on\nwindow ledges, in tree-holes, abandoned vehicles, air vents and man-made\nnest-boxes.\n\n\nBoth sexes are involved in nest-building.\n\n\nThe nest is often an untidy mass made of leaves, paper, pieces of\nplastic and a variety of other materials.\n\n\nTwo nests built on window ledges that were used by Common Mynas for\nseveral years were as large as half-a-metre in diameter!\n\n\nNests made in nest-boxes consist of a pile of materials lining three\nsides of the box.\n\n\nA shallow depression lined with leaves is formed in one corner and\nserves to hold the clutch.\n\n\nCommon Mynas lay between 3 to 6 eggs per clutch while White-vented\nMynas have been observed to lay about 2 to 4 eggs per clutch.\n\n\nThe eggs of both species are elliptical in shape, pale blue in colour\nand are about the same size and weight.\n\n\nEach egg is about 30 mm long and 21 mm wide and weighs about 7 g.\n\n\nA one-day old White-vented Myna begging for food.\n\n\nThe other nestling is two days old.\n\n\nThe last egg was eventually removed by the parent birds.\n\n\nA nest built by White-vented Mynas in a nest-box with a clutch of two\neggs.\n\n\nNot all the eggs of a clutch will hatch - - usually two fledglings\nare observed for each pair of birds, with broods of 3 or 4 being infrequent.\n\n\nThe length of time taken from the laying of the clutch to fledging\nhas been reported to be around 4 weeks for Common Mynas.\n\n\nMore work is currently being carried out to study the breeding\nbiology of both species in the aviary and in the field.\n\n\nMynas are considered pests in Singapore because of their habit of\nroosting communally in housing estates, where they irritate the residents\nwith their noise and soil the ground and objects below with their faeces.\n\n\nSo far, no effective method has been found to control these birds.\n\n\nMethods that are based on reducing food, nesting and roosting sites,\nare unlikely to succeed since both species use a wide range of these\nresources.\n\n\nSimilarly roost dispersal measures such as the pruning or removal of\nroost trees and scaring or killing the birds are only temporarily effective\nas birds return when the disturbance is stopped.\n\n\nAt present it seems that the public must learn to tolerate mild\ninconveniences as it is impossible to solve all roost problems.\n\n\nAfter all, mynas have always been roosting communally and it is\nalteration to the natural habitat which has created sites in our housing\nestates that provide suitable alternative roosting sites for the birds.\n\n\nMynas are not exotic but they are interesting birds to study.\n\n\nThere are still many aspects of their behaviour and ecology which\nwarrant investigation.\n\n\nFor instance, White-vented Mynas are expanding fairly rapidly up\nPeninsular Malaysia ( D R Wells, pers comm).\n\n\nHow would the population dynamics of Common and Buffalo Mynas A\nfuscus, which are resident in Peninsular Malaysia, change as White-vented\nMynas spread into their habitats?\n\n\nAnd in Singapore, the question still remains as to whether\nWhite-vented Mynas would displace Common Mynas as White-vented Mynas are the\nmore numerous species.\n\n\nWhilst both species have adapted well to the urban environment in\nSingapore, White-vented Mynas may be using a feeding strategy which better\nexploits the sources of food that are available.\n\n\nFor instance, government planning policies which cater for the\nplanting of fruit and flowering trees may inadvertently enhance the success\nof White-vented Mynas.\n\n\nIt has been estimated that of a total of about 691,915 trees that are\nmaintained by the Parks and Recreation Department, Ministry of National\nDevelopment, about 17% or 119,035 trees provide or could provide potential\nsources of food in the form of nectar or fruit which can be effectively\nexploited by White-vented Mynas.\n\n\nAnd fruit and nectar are not the only ephemeral food patches provided\nthrough the activities of Man.\n\n\nLawns and fields in parks, schools, gardens or road verges need to be\nmown regularly to remain well-kept and it has been seen that this activity\nsupplies insect prey and earthworms for mynas.\n\n\nA fledgling White vented Myna - - it can be distinguished by the\nwhite colour of its irides.\n\n\nAt this stage, it is still partially dependent on its parents for\nfood.\n\n\nThe number of birds in a roost ranges from a few to thousands.\n\n\nMany roosts are mixed, containing Common and White vented Mynas as\nwell as Philippine Glossy Starlings Aplonis panayensis.\n\n\nA communal roost in a housing estate - - the noise disturbs the\nresidents and faeces soil the cars parked below.\n\n\nMynas returning to roost as evening falls.\n\n\nHence Man's role in changing the habitat has contributed to the\nspread and increase in the size of the myna population in Singapore.\n\n\nHis activities may also have helped to enhance the success of\nWhite-vented Mynas in particular, by providing supplemental sources of food (\nie ephemeral food sources) which are exploited effectively by this species.\n\n\nThus two factors, use of a feeding strategy by the White-vented Myna\nthat may be more successful than the one adopted by the Common Myna, and\nMan's role in altering the habitat may have contributed to the White-vented\nMyna becoming the more common myna in Singapore.\n\n\nAcknowledgements.\n\n\nI am most grateful to Jeffrey Lee Pheng Guan for his critical\ncomments which have greatly improved the manuscript.\n\n\nPaul Sweet, Wang Luan Keng and Tommy Tan spent much valuable time and\neffort in helping to rear and breed mynas in captivity.\n\n\nI am indebted to the Parks and Recreation Department for providing\ninformation important to the study, and all others who have helped in one way\nor the other.\n\n\nThe

environment.\n\n\nYet their existence is often taken for granted and their importance\nto Man is overlooked.\n\n\nTo help pupils appreciate the roles of plants and animals in our\nenvironment, it is necessary to make pupils aware of Man's dependence on\nother living organisms.\n\n\nAt the same time, pupils should know that there are a number of\nplants and animals that can be harmful to Man.\n\n\nHowever, it must be impressed on pupils that whether a living\norganism is helpful or harmful usually depends on the situation.\n\n\nFor example, in the preceding chapter, pupils learned that\ndecomposers are essential to the natural environment.\n\n\nOn the other hand, in this chapter pupils learn that decomposers can\nbe harmful in that they destroy a lot of food and other materials.\n\n\nAt the end of this chapter, pupils should\n\n\n1) be able to describe how some plants and animals are useful.\n\n\n2) be able to describe how some plants and animals are harmful.\n\n\n3) know some methods Man uses to control harmful animals.\n\n\n4) know the cause of food decay.\n\n\n5) be able to describe common methods of food preservation.\n\n\nFrom the human point of view, an animal or a plant is often regarded\nas distinctively helpful or harmful.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it actually depends on the situation.\n\n\nEven then, it is not easy to tell whether a given organism is being\nhelpful or harmful.\n\n\nHence, many a time judgement has to be suspended.\n\n\nOne important fact we have to recognize is that every living\norganism is part of and important to the global community.\n\n\nWe, humans, depend on the rest of this community.\n\n\nWith increasing global concern about the preservation of Nature, it\nis important to emphasize that plants which are used by Man should be\nspecially cultivated.\n\n\nIn this way, we do not deplete natural resources.\n\n\nPlants can be useful in the following ways.\n\n\n1) Plants replenish the atmosphere with oxygen during the process of\nphotosynthesis.\n\n\n2) Many plants are grown for food.\n\n\n3) Many plants are grown for the manufacture of medicine and other\nhealthcare products. \n\n\n4) Some plants provide us with useful materials to make the objects\nwe need.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5f646722-84f5-4bdd-bbd7-dab4b7b5d22e', 'added':

{'text': "The Silvered-leaf Monkey of Bukit Melawati, Selangor \n\n\nby Lee Pheng Guan and Kang Nee\n\n\nThe Silvered-leaf Monkey or Silvered Langur, Presbytis cristata (\nRaffles), also known as Lotong Kelabu in Malay, is found in southern Myanmar,\nIndo-China, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, south to Sumatra, Java and Borneo.\n\n\nIt frequents mangrove and freshwater swamp forests where its natural\ndiet consists of fruit, leaves and shoots of many plants, including that of\nmangrove species.\n\n\nThe adult monkey is generally dull grey with pale silver tips to the\nlonger hairs.\n\n\nThe hands, feet, crown and tail are somewhat darker.\n\n\nA distinctive feature, is the ragged crest of erect hairs on the top\nof the head.\n\n\nThe monkeys can be divided into a few age groups.\n\n\nThe infants are covered with bright orange fur until 3-5 months old,\nafter which the fur gradually changes to a dull grey, starting with the fur\non the head, face, hands and feet.\n\n\nThe older infants thus have grey-coloured heads with pale orange\nbodies.\n\n\nThe juveniles have the adult coloration but are smaller.\n\n\nAdults are sexually mature and larger, a full grown male may reach\n560 mm excluding the tail or 686 mm including the tail.\n\n\nAdult females can be distinguished from males by their having\nirregular patches of white on the inner portion of the upper thighs.\n\n\nWe had an opportunity to study the monkeys in June 1991 during a\nfield trip to Kuala Selangor Nature Park.\n\n\nBukit Melawati is a rocky outcrop rising 40 metres above the town of\nKuala Selangor and is the site of an ancient fortress.\n\n\nIt subtends the Kuala Selangor Nature Park to the west.\n\n\nThe organisation amongst primate societies may be complex and a\ndetailed analysis of the social organisation in the Silvered-leaf Monkeys of\nBukit Melawati could not be made due to our short period of study.\n\n\nHowever, some interesting behaviour within and between troops were\nobserved, including food choice, social interaction, infant care, inter-troop\nbehaviour and interactions with man.\n\n\nThe Silvered-leaf Monkeys at Bukit Melawati Park are fairly tame,\nranging freely through their territories, including over available rooftops\nand pylons.\n\n\nThey frequently come down to the ground to feed on food thrown to\nthem by visitors.\n\n\nThis behaviour is quite unlike that of their shy counterparts\ninhabiting the nearby mangrove forests of Kuala Selangor Nature Park.\n\n\nTheir tameness allowed us to observe them at play, at rest, feeding\nand interacting within and outside the troop.\n\n\nThe group we observed was a large one, comprising three troops, each\nwith about 30 members.\n\n\nA researcher, Irwin Bernstein, studied these monkeys in the mid-60s.\n\n\nInterestingly, judging from the troop movements and territories of\nthe troops we observed, these three troops could well be the same three\ntroops Bernstein had studied on Bukit Melawati, which he labelled as troops\nM, W and E.\n\n\nThough the borders of the territories of the three troops might have\nshifted somewhat, they still corresponded roughly to those reported by\nBernstein.\n\n\nIf this is true, then we can compare the population sizes of the\nthree troops to their population thirty years ago.\n\n\nIn 1968, the troop size of M was 42-51, that of W was 26-31 and E\n20-23.\n\n\nIn 1991, we have tentatively designated troops E, M and W as\ncorresponding to our troops 1, 2 and 3, which comprise 27, 20 and 26\nindividuals respectively.\n\n\nIt can be seen that the population sizes of troops 1 and 3 have\nchanged little while that of troop 2 has decreased.\n\n\nTroops of monkeys have been reported to occupy territories of 20\nhectares on average.\n\n\nEach troop is led by a dominant male, known as the control male.\n\n\nWhen two or more of the troops we were studying met, there were\nfrequent displays of territorial aggression towards one another.\n\n\nThis usually occurred on the boundaries of adjacent territories where\nthere were a few disputed trees.\n\n\nA food patch set up to observe their feeding behaviour.\n\n\nPeanuts are one of their favourite foods.\n\n\n Food choice and feeding behaviour \n\n\nWe chose this disputed area to lay down our food patches to study the\nfeeding behaviour of the monkeys.\n\n\nAltogether nine types of food were presented and the feeding choice\nof the monkeys recorded.\n\n\nThe monkeys fed most frequently and readily on food items like\npeanuts, banana and watermelon, but jackfruit and green apple were taken last\nand in small quantities.\n\n\nRaisin, dates, melon seeds and grasshoppers were avoided completely.\n\n\nThe monkey's choice of food may be partly a reflection of their\nhabituation to humans.\n\n\nPeanuts and banana are often regarded by humans as standard 'monkey\nfood' and would be the food items most likely offered to the monkeys.\n\n\nThey would thus have learned to eat these foods.\n\n\nWatermelon may be taken readily because it is relatively easy to\nprocess, being soft and fleshy.\n\n\nJackfruit and apples are perhaps less 'familiar' food to the monkeys\nand thus were taken less readily; or they may require more effort to eat.\n\n\nThe monkeys seemed to be deterred from eating apples by their\nhardness - - one monkey was seen to spend more than three minutes eating an\napple, compared to the one minute spent on softer fruit like banana and\nwatermelon.\n\n\nEating jackfruit involved prying open the chambers to get at the\nedible parts inside.\n\n\nWe also found that they ate the seeds of the jackfruit as well.\n\n\nA troop of Silvered-leaf Monkeys amongst the branches of an Angsana\ntree at Bukit Melawati Park.\n\n\nLeaves remain the staple diet of the monkeys.\n\n\nThey choose the youngest leaves or leaf buds.\n\n\nOne reason why raisins and dates were avoided may be due to their\nhigh sugar content.\n\n\nBeing herbivores the monkeys depend on microorganisms in the gut to\nhelp digest the cellulose in their food.\n\n\nIt is possible that a high sugar diet may lead to the microorganisms\nfermenting the excess sugar and eventually causing the animal to become ill.\n\n\nIf so, they may associate the sweet taste or the sight of such foods\nwith illness and thus avoid these foods.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it could be that they have not formed a search\nimage for these items, not having been offered any before.\n\n\nSuch might be the case for the melon seeds as well.\n\n\nThe grasshoppers with their hind-wings and legs removed, were not\nnoticed by the monkeys, who were more intent on the fruit.\n\n\nThe insects thus managed to crawl away from the food patch.\n\n\nWhen the food had been eaten, the troops moved away from the food\npatches and engaged in other activities like grooming, playing, etc.\n\n\nIn the later part of the afternoon, some disturbance was noticed\namongst members of troop 2 and vocalizations like low squeaks and squeals\nwere heard.\n\n\nA few juveniles started running over the grass towards a stand of\nlarge Angsana ( Pterocarpus indicus) trees, pausing now and then to call.\n\n\nEventually, one juvenile clambered up a tree, to be followed very\nshortly by the whole troop.\n\n\nThe troop then proceeded to eat the leaves of the Angsana,\napparently, selecting the lighter-green, young leaves and leaf-buds.\n\n\n Intra-troop behaviour \n\n\nBefore we laid down the food patches in the early afternoon, troops 1\nand 3 were observed to be resting.\n\n\nMembers of the troops sat quietly in the trees, some scanning the\nsurroundings, grooming, or sleeping on their stomachs, with legs and tails\ndraped over the branches.\n\n\nWith the laying down of the food patches, a few adult males clambered\ndown almost immediately and started eating before we had finished laying out\nthe food.\n\n\nOther members of the troop followed shortly but there were always a\nfew remaining in the trees.\n\n\nAssertion of dominance was sometimes displayed at the food patches\nthat were set up.\n\n\nOne or two males were seen to monopolize the food patch, sometimes\npreventing others from taking the food.\n\n\nSome other adults stayed near the food and ate without being\ndisturbed.\n\n\nMost older infants and juveniles snatched a handful of food and then\nran off somewhere, like up a tree and ate it slowly.\n\n\nThe dominance hierarchy seemed fairly established, since all-out\nchallenges involving pulling or slapping were not observed.\n\n\nNo threat displays were observed either.\n\n\nFemales with infants were allowed to feed freely at the food patches\nand were seldom chased away.\n\n\nA dominance hierarchy can be observed at the food patch where\ndominant individuals get to feed first.\n\n\nThe greeting display of the monkeys was interesting.\n\n\nOne individual would walk up to another and sniff at its thigh.\n\n\nSniffing and hugging were observed frequently.\n\n\nIt has also been recorded that embracing of the flanks is performed\nduring periods of apparent distress.\n\n\nAt play, the monkeys pulled at each other's faces, executed light\npunches, engaged in wrestling or chased each other up the trees.\n\n\nMost play behaviour involved immature animals but animals of all ages\nand both sexes sometimes participated.\n\n\nJuveniles and infants were most active.\n\n\nThey were quite destructive to the surrounding vegetation.\n\n\nOne troop was observed to charge up an Allamanda shrub creating a\ncommotion and then scampering off leaving behind broken branches, fallen\nleaves, flowers and stems.\n\n\nGrooming usually involved two animals, and was most frequently\nobserved between females and infants.\n\n\nOne male was observed to move alone, often sitting by himself while\nwatching others at play, but never taking part in any of the activities.\n\n\nHe received some grooming from another adult male, but did not\nreciprocate the action.\n\n\nHe was also observed to attempt to join another troop but was chased\naway by the juveniles and adults of that group.\n\n\nThis suggests that the male may be left alone within his troop, but\nis unwelcome in another, unlike the juveniles which were seen to move freely\nfrom one troop to another.\n\n\nIn contrast to the juveniles, infants were rarely left alone.\n\n\nThere was nearly always an adult female within an arm's length away\nthat kept an eye on the infant as it moved around amongst the branches or on\nthe ground.\n\n\nAs soon as an alarm call was given by any member of the troop, the\nadult female would pull the infant towards her and scramble off to safety\nwith the infant clinging to her chest.\n\n\nIt was also observed that an infant does not always stay with just\none adult female, but may be looked after by other adult females, juvenile\nfemales and even adult males.\n\n\nThis is known as allomaternal behaviour.\n\n\nOne infant was transferred between five 'baby-sitters' during the two\nhours it was followed, and it was seen to suckle from two of the females.\n\n\nWhen danger approaches, or when the troop is on the move, the infant\nis carried under its guardian's chest.\n\n\nThe transfer of an infant usually occurred when a female approached\nthe playing infant and its female baby-sitter and tried to pull the infant\ntowards her.\n\n\nUsually the transfer took place smoothly without any aggression\nbetween them.\n\n\nHowever, such transfers can occasionally lead to a fight between the\ntwo females with the loser backing off from the infant.\n\n\nIn the case of transfer of infants between males, it was usually the\ninfant which initiated the interaction and the males were the passive\nparticipants.\n\n\nMany theories have been suggested to explain this allomaternal\nbehaviour or infant transfer in primates, particularly in terms of the social\nadvantages to the females.\n\n\nFor instance, through the interactions with infants, females learn\nparental care.\n\n\nWhen the mother of an infant dies, the frequent interactions between\nthe infant and its baby-sitter may allow the infant to be adopted by another\nfemale or even an older sibling.\n\n\nWhilst troop 2 was feeding on the leaves of the Angsana tree, we\nnoticed a persistent squealing from one of the infants.\n\n\nOn closer inspection, we discovered that this individual did not\nhave a left hand.\n\n\nThe forelimb was broken off at the middle of the forearm.\n\n\nUnlike other infants, this individual was not tended to despite its\nsqueals.\n\n\nThe adults continued to feed on the leaves and only after a few\nminutes did one female drew this individual into her arms. \n\n\nInfant transfer between two adults.\n\n\nSuch allomaternal behaviour may benefit both infant and adult - -\nthe former gaining extra protection and care; the latter a lesson in looking\nafter young.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '63bfc6f2-805c-4c35-85cc-c8a964762e44', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.769349+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': 'The rare Indo-Pacific furry lobster, Palinurellus wieneckii (\nfamily Synaxidae) \n\n\nPeter K L Ng\n\n\nThe coral reefs of the Indo-West Pacific abound with numerous\nbeautiful and brightly coloured decapod crustaceans.\n\n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing interest in these\ncrustaceans by aquarium keepers.\n\n\nMany small species are not only brightly coloured but also have\ninteresting habits.\n\n\nOne of the rarest possible acquisitions must surely be the bright-red\nIndo-Pacific Furry Lobster, Palinurellus wieneckii ( De Man, 1881).\n\n\nPalinurellus wieneckii is a small lobster by any standards.\n\n\nAdults are not known to grow larger than 200 mm ( usually less than\n100 mm) in total length, and have a stunning bright red colour all over.\n\n\nThe numerous short hairs covering its body give the animal its common\nname of Furry Lobster, although in Hawaii, it is called the Mole Lobster (\nprobably because of its shape).\n\n\nThe Indo-Pacific Furry Lobster is quite rare but widely distributed\nand has been recorded from many localities throughout the Indo-West Pacific.\n\n\nToday, the Indo-Pacific Furry Lobster together with only two other\nspecies ( Palinurellus gundlachi from the western Atlantic and Palibythis\nmagnificus from the central Pacific), are placed in the Synaxidae, a family\nallied to the true spiny lobsters of the family Palinuridae.\n\n\nIn fact, in many books, Palinurellus is still classified with the\nspiny lobsters in the Palinuridae.\n\n\nThe Indo-Pacific Furry Lobster was first described as Araeosternus\nwieneckii by the great Dutch carcinologist J G De Man in 1881.\n\n\nThe species was named in honour of its collector, Mr Wieneck.\n\n\nDe Man thought that the species was so unusual and different from\ntypical spiny lobsters that he established a new genus for the species,\nAraeosternus.\n\n\nHe even established a new subfamily for it, Araeosterninae.\n\n\nUnfortunately, De Man did not know that a German carcinologist, E von\nMartens had described a very similar looking animal ( which he named\nPalinurellus gundlachi) from the western Atlantic three years earlier in 1878\nwhich he named as a new genus and species, Palinurellus gundlachi.\n\n\nDe man, on learning about von Martens\' species a year later, realised\nthat although his species, Araeosternus wieneckii was different from von\nMartens\' Palinurellus gundlachi, his genus Araeosternus was certainly the\nsame as Palinurellus.\n\n\nBy the rules of taxonomy, the genus name Palinurellus has priority\nover Araeosternus, and De man dutifully transferred his species to the genus\nPalinurellus.\n\n\nDe Man ( 1881) was right in recognising that his animal belonged to a\ngrouping distinct from typical spiny lobsters, hence his establishment of a\nnew subfamily, the Araeosterninae.\n\n\nUnfortunately for De Man, he again lost credit for this discovery - -\nby a mere four months!\n\n\nIn March 1881 the great English carcinologist, C S Bate, named a new\nfamily, the Synaxidae, for an American lobster he also described as new,\nSynaxes hybridica.\n\n\nBate\'s animal proved to be the same as von Martens\' Palinurellus\ngundlachi.\n\n\nAs von Martens\' animal was named earlier ( 1878 vs 1881), the species\nmust be called Palinurellus gundlachi.\n\n\nBut the sometimes quirky rules of zoological nomenclature mandate\nthat the rules of priority also apply for family and subfamily names.\n\n\nBate recognised Palinurellus as a separate family ( Synaxidae) in\nMarch 1881.\n\n\nDe Man recognised Palinurellus as a separate subfamily (\nAraeosterninae) in July 1881.\n\n\nSince the genus Palinurellus is today recognised as a distinct family\ngroup by itself ( with the allied genus Palibythus), the earliest name used\nmust be applied for the group.\n\n\nAs a grouping of subfamily rank can be upgraded to full family status\n( ie De Man\'s Araeosterninae becomes Araeosternidae), Synaxidae and\nAraeosternidae technically denote the same grouping!\n\n\nAnd Bate\'s Synaxidae is the earlier valid name by four months!\n\n\nPalinurellus wieneckii was described from Pulau Tikus ( literally\ntranslated from the Malay vernacular to mean Rat Island), an island off\nBengkulu, southwestern Sumatra.\n\n\nIt has since been reported from the Red Sea, South Africa, Mauritius,\nPhuket ( Thailand), Ryukyus ( Japan), Philippines, Sumatra, Borneo, New\nGuinea, Caroline Islands, New Caledonia, New Hebrides and Hawaii.\n\n\nBut few specimens are known.\n\n\nThe specimens figured here were obtained from an aquarium dealer who\nsaid they were from the Philippines.\n\n\nLarvae believed to be P wieneckii had been found in the Philippines\nbefore, but no adults as yet have been collected.\n\n\nPalinurellus wieneckii is quite unlike any spiny lobster species.\n\n\nNot only does it differ in being smaller and more brightly coloured,\nit also has much shorter antennae ( feelers) which are not spiny, and a less\ncylindrical carapace ( shell) with a cristate lateral margin.\n\n\nThe body is also covered with a relatively thick coat of short hairs.\n\n\nThe long frontal horns ( adjacent to the eyes) of typical spiny\nlobsters are also absent in Palinurellus.\n\n\nUnlike spiny lobsters, members of the genus Palinurellus also have\nbiramous pleopods ( swimmerets) on the second abdominal male segment ( vs\nuniramous).\n\n\nThe unusual features of Palinurellus and its only other known\nrelative, Palibythis, easily justify their placement in a separate family.\n\n\nTypical spiny lobsters ( of gourmet fame) belong to several genera,\nwith Panulirus being the most common in this part of the world.\n\n\nIn Southeast Asian coral reefs colourful spiny lobster species like P\nornatus, P versicolour and P homarus abound.\n\n\nThe spiny lobster most common in the market and restaurants, is P\npolyphagus, which is not a reef species.\n\n\nYoung specimens of these spiny lobsters ( especially P versicolour)\nare often kept in aquaria as pets.\n\n\nThere are still some unresolved problems with the rare and poorly\nknown Indo-Pacific Furry Lobster.\n\n\nOne of these problems pertains to sexual differences.\n\n\nSexing lobsters is easy enough.\n\n\nMale lobsters have their genital openings ( clearly visible in adults\nas a translucent pore) on the base ( coxa) of the last ( fifth) leg.\n\n\nIn females, the genital openings are on the bases of the third pair\nof legs.\n\n\nAccording to L B Holthius, who has worked on lobsters extensively,\nthe type ( original) male specimen of P wieneckii has no pleopods on the\nsternum of the first abdominal segment whereas female specimens do.\n\n\nThere have been reports, however, of the presence of a simple pleopod\non the first abdominal segment.\n\n\nIn the present specimens supposedly from the Philippines, the male\nhas no sign of pleopods on the first abdominal segment but the female has,\nsupporting Holthius\' belief.\n\n\nIn the aquarium, Palinurellus wieneckii is a very peaceful and shy\nspecies and can be kept easily with fish and other crustaceans without any\ndifficulty.\n\n\nIt hides under coral rocks during the day, and will feed on scraps of\nfish and prawns.\n\n\nIt has been collected from gill nets from waters ranging from 9-27\nmetres deep, and believed to be mainly nocturnal.\n\n\nOtherwise, biologists know almost nothing about the biology and\nbehaviour of this peculiar animal! \n\n\n\n\n SCUBA DIVING: BEING IN A DIFFERENT WORLD \n\n\nL M CHOU\n\n\nMan\'s desire to breathe and move about freely in the underwater\nenvironment led to the invention of the aqualung in the 1940s.\n\n\nSince then, constant technological improvement of the SCUBA ( Self\nContained Underwater Breathing Apparatus) equipment has enabled man to\nconquer the watery medium, giving him the much appreciated freedom to move\nabout and remain underwater with a portable supply of air.\n\n\nUpgrading and refinement of equipment have made scuba diving safe and\npleasant as a healthy sport.\n\n\nWhile occasional accidents do occur, most result from human\ncarelessness and disrespect for safety procedures, rather than from equipment\nfailure.\n\n\nScuba has become an indispensable tool for the study of what goes on\nin the mysterious world.\n\n\nAs a scuba diver and coral reef ecologist, I find myself in a job\nwhich few can complain about.\n\n\nLearning to scuba dive more than 12 years ago was more out of\nnecessity for the nature of my research, and there have been no regrets\nsince.\n\n\nLooking at marine life in its own environment is a very satisfying\nexperience.\n\n\nThe satisfaction comes not only from the incredible beauty of the\nplants and animals, but also from appreciating what it is like to live\nunderwater influenced by pressure and weightlessness.\n\n\nThe diver cannot help noticing the sudden transformation the moment\nhe plunges into the sea.\n\n\nThe ready welcome of the silent world is something quite\nunforgettable, especially after kitting up in a small crowded boat with noise\nand confusion reigning.\n\n\nThe hassle of struggling into the wet suit, donning heavy tanks,\nchecking equipment, clambering clumsily against all the weight to a vantage\npoint and balancing unsteadily before the final plunge, are all immediately\nforgotten on breaking through the water\'s surface.\n\n\nOnce in, the diver quickly takes control and moves about with little\neffort.\n\n\nThe weight of the equipment that threatens to drag the diver down is\nmiraculously gone.\n\n\nSwimming through the water and listening to your own breathing and\nthe occasional clicking sounds of the marine organisms, the diver learns to\nrelax and enjoy the full leisure associated with diving.\n\n\nThe mind relaxes.\n\n\nStress becomes unknown.\n\n\nThe beauty of the colourful underwater life can be admired\nunhurriedly and the feeling is only of great exhilaration.\n\n\nBreathtaking sights await the diver, and coral reefs of the region do\noffer the best attractions.\n\n\nFish and other marine life are abundant and diverse in these waters\nand they make every dive interesting.\n\n\nHaving good well-maintained equipment is essential as they are the\nonly life-support systems in the watery depths.\n\n\nDiving with an alert buddy is crucial and this basic rule should\nnever be ignored.\n\n\nA personal experience has imprinted on me the importance of this\nprotocol.\n\n\nAlthough my equipment was checked before the dive and had never been\nknown to malfunction, something happened to cause my air supply to run out\nunnoticed after only 20 minutes.\n\n\nFortunately my buddy was there to provide sufficient air for the slow\ndecompression ascent.\n\n\nWhen the equipment was sent for a complete check, nothing wrong was\nfound.\n\n\nTo date, there have been no further problems and I still do not know\nwhat caused the air to run out so rapidly on that particular dive.\n\n\nA second incident underscored the importance of a buddy.\n\n\nDuring a dive at 20 m to study fish populations at artificial reefs,\nI became too engrossed to check the time spent and the status of the air\nsupply and had to depend on my buddy during the ascent.\n\n\nResearch divers sometimes take unnecessary risks in order to complete\nthe final 10 meters of the survey transect or last few sectors of a permanent\nquadrat.\n\n\nThese incidents showed me how helpless a diver is underwater without\nfunctioning support systems.\n\n\nIt has however not discouraged me from continuing with this most\nself-fulfilling activity and experiencing the joy of being close to nature in\nits own realm. \n\n\n\n\n The Tricky Tripletail Or " Gotta Pick a Patipok" \n\n\nThis versatile fish lives in tropical and sub-tropical seas\nworldwide, ranging throughout mid Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.\n\n\nThey are often found around buoys, floating debris and weed lines.\n\n\nThey also like to lurk around bottom structures like shipwrecks.\n\n\nTripletails are deep-bodied, perch-like fish ( they look like a cross\nbetween a gourami and a talapia) with long, rounded anal and dorsal fins,\nextending almost to the tail.\n\n\nI first set eyes on this strange fish about 15-years ago when I\ncaught four whilst fishing over a wreck off Horsburgh Lighthouse.\n\n\nNobody on board knew its name so we decided to call it " Black\nSeabass".\n\n\nStrangely enough, I have never caught this fish at Horsburgh since.\n\n\nAbout 7 years ago, my good fishing buddy, Zainal Azman, called me\nsometime in early May.\n\n\n" Hey Grant, the patipok season is about to start, why don\'t you get\nsome of your khakis and we can camp at Pulau Bidan and catch some off the\ntarget buoys".\n\n\nI had absolutely no idea what a patipok was and not wanting to sound\nignorant, I said " Sure, I\'ll be up next weekend - how big are they?".\n\n\n" Oh, about 3-5 kgs", Azman replied.\n\n\nAs soon as I put the phone down, I called up several of my Malay\nfishing friends in an attempt to find out what a patipok was - not one of\nthem knew what I was talking about.  One even asked jokingly " You\'re sure\nit\'s not a currypok?" ( Malay curry-puff).', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '6e146d43-deb2-4140-8b37-0bcfc9d9870c', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.770627+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9587799906730652, 'non_english_score': 0.041220009326934814}
{'text': 'Naturally Yours, Singapore \n\n\nTan Wee Kiat\n\n\n INTRODUCTION:Singapore\'s Natural Heritage \n\n\nAlong the equator, the sun beats down from its zenith with a maximum\nintensity, that varies little between the peaks in March and September.\n\n\nThe length of day is also constant throughout the year.\n\n\nBarely a degree and a half north of the equator, a mere nine minutes\nseparate the longest day year from the shortest.\n\n\nIn this equable region, the daily dose of solar radiation warms the\nshallow waters of the China Sea to a uniform 28 degrees Celsius at its\nsurface.\n\n\nWind velocities are muted, even when the Southeast Asian monsoons\nbring minor variations to the weather.\n\n\nThe moisture laden air from these monsoons delivers more than 2000 mm\nof rain fairly evenly throughout the year.\n\n\nHere in the doldrums, where climatic variations are greater from day\nto night than from summer to winter, there lie some fifty islands which total\nthe 636 sq km of the Republic of Singapore.\n\n\nSet like the point at the end of Peninsular Malaya\'s exclamation\nmark, the 570 sq km Singapore Island and its offshore islands steep in the\nwarm waters, buffered from the seismic activity which rims the Asian-Pacific\nregion.\n\n\nMillennia upon millennia of incubator-like calm enjoyed by the\narchipelago has permitted a multitude of living organisms to adapt, evolve,\ninteract, reproduce and weave a web of life of such intricacy and complexity\nover the hospitable substrate that it has defied full understanding and\ndocumentation to the present day.\n\n\nAt the founding of Singapore in 1819, luxuriant lowland equatorial\nrainforest clothed the gently undulating terrain of the islands.\n\n\nIt was a view that was to inspire the naturalist in the founder,\nStamford Raffles, and to elicit the comment three years later from Crawford,\nEmbassy from the Governor-General of India, " I do not believe there is any\npart of the world which can afford a prospect in its way of superior\nbeauty....".\n\n\nThe land\'s intrinsic value and natural beauty did not stay the hand\nof man from rending the web of life which mantled the islands.\n\n\nThe colonial imperative, and later, priorities of nation building,\ndictated the wholesale reshaping of topography and clearing of forest to\nprovide space for the cultivation of crops.\n\n\nThe graceful contours of the land were flattened as hills were cut to\nfill in swamps and valleys.\n\n\nCoasts and bays were buried and smoothed.\n\n\nQuarries were gouged into granite-bearing rock, and timbers were\nextracted, all to meet the exigencies of a rapidly growing and thriving\ncommunity.\n\n\nSingapore came to provide a classic example of man\'s impact upon his\nenvironment, of a near total disruption of nature in all her aspects.\n\n\nThirty years after the founding of Singapore, more than half the\nforest was still intact.\n\n\nBy 1854, however, the noted naturalist, Alfred Russell Wallace,\ndescribed the forest as having been reduced to isolated patches on tops of\nhills.\n\n\nThe communities that were lost included those of the primary lowland\ntropical evergreen forest, the freshwater swamp, the mangrove, and the beach.\n\n\nDespite government ordinances and regulations set forth by the\nestablishment of the Forest Reserves in 1882, the political will to enforce\nthe laws for the protection of nature waxed and waned.\n\n\nWhen stewardship of Singapore passed from colonial hands, the\ninventory of nature reserves included Bukit Timah ( 75 ha), Pandan ( 219 ha),\nKranji ( 20 ha), Labrador ( 4 ha) and the central catchment area ( 1,622 ha).\n\n\nThe first 25 years of nationhood saw the remarkable transformation of\nSingapore into a cosmopolitan city-state.\n\n\nIt is often said that this has been achieved without the benefit of\nany natural resources.\n\n\nIt does not detract, however, from the obvious ability, dedication\nand strength of character of Singapore\'s builders to append that its natural\nresources have indeed contributed significantly to the nation\'s growth in the\npast.\n\n\nIncreasingly, as Singapore strives for excellence as a global city of\nthe future, the people are awaking to the importance of caring for her\nremaining natural resources.\n\n\nThe building of Singapore into a major centre of industry, commerce,\ncommunications and tourism has transformed a colonial trading post into a\ngleaming metropolis of concrete, glass and steel.\n\n\nMore than 80% of its population of three million own their homes in\nhigh- rise apartments in satellite towns.\n\n\nThe creation of comfortable work environments has elicited high\nproductivity from a competent and dedicated work force.\n\n\nThis is a notable achievement in a part of the world that is hampered\nwith high Discomfort Indices in terms of temperature and relative humidity.\n\n\nWithin buildings, air conditioning has been the key.\n\n\nFor the external environment, a " clean and green" agenda was\nestablished early in the development of the city.\n\n\nThe " garden city" programme saw to the planting of millions of trees\nand shrubs along city streets and highways.\n\n\nA system of parks and open spaces was developed to offer relief from\nan increasingly concretised environment.\n\n\nRefinement of the programme has brought more colour, fragrance and\nvariety to the planted areas.\n\n\nOver the years, an aggressive plant introduction programme has\namassed a rich array of cultivated species and hybrids on Singapore soil.\n\n\nReminiscent of the immigrant races who have made their way to our\nshores, many of these introduced plants thrived and became naturalised in the\nsalubrious environment.\n\n\nThe Garden City image of Singapore owes much to the presence of these\nelements from foreign shores.\n\n\nWith growing affluence, the needs and aspirations of a better\neducated and more widely travelled population are not easily satisfied.\n\n\nWell-tended parks where natural succession is kept at bay at great\nexpense of manpower and funds no longer suffice to fulfill aesthetic and\nspiritual needs.\n\n\nIt is a world-wide phenomenon, this gradual impingement upon public\nconsciousness that man\'s presence in the biological history of the earth is\nbut a mote in the rich tapestry of evolved life forms.\n\n\nAs Singapore has become an important international communication hub,\nher people are no longer insulated from sharing this experience.\n\n\nThis " green" awareness stimulated a growing appreciation for nature\nand the call of the wild.\n\n\nIt is bringing home the realisation that Singapore still possesses a\nrich heritage of native flora and fauna which requires nurture.\n\n\nThe confluence of this new-found awareness, the yearning to retain\ncultural and historical roots, and the capability to do something about it,\nculminated in the formation of a statutory body whose time had come.\n\n\nThe National Parks Board came into existence on 6 June 1990 with the\nresponsibility to develop, manage and promote the national parks and nature\nreserves of Singapore as valuable resources for recreation, research,\neducation and conservation.\n\n\nDesignated as National Parks are Fort Canning Park, the Singapore\nBotanic Gardens and over 2000 hectares of Nature Reserves in the centre of\nSingapore Island.\n\n\n NATIONAL PARKS OF SINGAPORE \n\n\n Fort Canning Park: green lung of the civic district \n\n\nWhen Raffles sailed into the mouth of the Singapore River, a hill 45\nm above the low-lying plain was the dominating feature that greeted him.\n\n\nThis was the " Forbidden Hill", Bukit Larangan, seat of the rulers of\nancient Temasek.\n\n\nThe crumbling fortifications emanating from the hill had once\nrepelled Siamese invaders from the north.\n\n\nA spring on the slope facing the river fed the bathing pool of the\nroyal family.\n\n\nThe tombs of 14th - century nobility kept the hill sacrosanct.\n\n\nRecognising the obvious advantages of the strategic site, the\ncolonial founder established his residence on the hill.\n\n\nRaffles not only had his house built there but also set about\nplanning the first botanic garden of Singapore on the hill.\n\n\nA 48-acre plot incorporating a portion of the eastern slopes of the\nhill was set aside for this purpose.\n\n\nRaffles expended much effort and personal expense in establishing the\ngarden.\n\n\nEssentially a plantation of economic crops on trial, this garden\ncarried the British hopes of breaking the Dutch monopoly on the lucrative\nspice trade in the East.\n\n\nTo the coconuts, bananas, betel nuts and vegetables of the early\nMalay settlers and the gambier and pepper cultivation of the first Chinese\nsettlers, Raffles added nutmeg and cloves.\n\n\nThis was followed by the introduction of other cash crops like\ncinnamon, coffee, cocoa, cotton, gamboge, indigo, vanilla and sugarcane.\n\n\nPests and diseases, with which the native species had achieved a\ntruce, made unprofitable the plantation cropping of most of these new\nintroductions.\n\n\nPepper and gamier proved successful.\n\n\nTheir tandem cultivation was however, to have disastrous consequences\nfor the forest of Singapore in the 19th century.\n\n\nThe residence of Stamford Raffles conferred upon the hill the name "\nGovernment Hill".\n\n\nIn 1859, the hill\'s strategic attributes caused it to be turned into\nan artillery fort complete with barracks, a hospital, magazines, ramparts,\ntrenches, 68-pounder cannons and other fortifications.\n\n\nIt was named Fort Canning in honour of Viscount George Canning,\nGovernor General and First Viceroy of India.\n\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, a Colonel Canning supervised the construction\nof the Fort.\n\n\nIn 1907, the artillery moved from Fort Canning Hill, and the Fort\nbecame the headquarters of the Far East Command.\n\n\nThe military role of the hill continued until the 1 970\'s, first as a\nmilitary base occupied by the British, then by the Japanese during World War\nII, and lastly by the Republic\'s armed forces.\n\n\nDeparture of the military presence left an oasis of green in the\ncentre of a brick, concrete, steel and glass jungle that has risen around the\nbase of the hill.\n\n\nA covered reservoir occupies the summit, and next to it lies buried\nan extensive bunker complex, silent testimony to the futile efforts of\nBritish Far East Command.\n\n\nTelecommunication installations have gracelessly usurped the site of\nthe former residence of Raffles.\n\n\nSome of the relics on the hill from the 14th and 19th centuries are\nbeing incorporated in a re-development programme by the National Parks Board\nto rejuvenate Fort Canning Park as Singapore\'s " Hill of History".\n\n\nOne of the two remaining military buildings, Fort Canning Centre, has\nalready been restored for cultural use, replacing the tramp of soldiers\'\nboots with the soft pads of dancers\' feet.\n\n\nThe other building, the old Singapore Common Staff College, awaits\nits turn for adaptive re-use in the plans to revitalise the hill.\n\n\nThe verdant growth of plants, native, introduced or escaped, is\ngradually softening the rude touch of man on the hill.\n\n\nA trace of the botanic garden, abandoned in 1829 through lack of\nproper administration and government support, is seen in several ancient\ncoconut palm which line a steep walkway leading to a splendidly restored\nkeramat.\n\n\nA kapu tree ( Ceiba pentandra) sheds cotton puffs on a lawn which was\nformerly the first Christian cemetery in Singapore.\n\n\nTropical fig species ( Ficussp.) are in full evidence in many forms\non Fort Canning.\n\n\nThey cover the Fort ramparts with a network of roots and smother host\ntrees to eventually become free-standing components of the canopy.\n\n\nThey creep up trunks of large trees to display their luscious fruit\nto tempt potential seed delivery agents and crawl over ground, rock and wall\nwith such an affinity as to form a green skin over bare forms.\n\n\nMagnificent raintrees ( Samanea saman) with wide-spreading crowns,\nintroduced from their native South America in 1876, have become vital\nnaturalised components of our greenscape.\n\n\nA whole community of epiphytes and arboreal fauna regards their\nbranches as home.\n\n\nGiant-leaved relatives of the breadfruit ( Artocarpus sp) rise tall\ninto the canopy, strewing the ground with leather-brown leaves like discarded\nplatters.\n\n\nMadras thorn trees ( Pithecellobium dulce), banished from the city\nstreets because of their untidy habits, grow to majestic size on the steep\nslopes of the hill.\n\n\nOther fine-leaved legumes like the saga ( Adenanthera pavonina),\nalbizia ( Albizia falcataria), tamarind ( Tamarindus indicsu) and yellow\nflame ( Peltophorum pterocarpum) blend their lace-like foliage with their\ncoarser-leaved cousins, the jiring ( Pithecellobium jiringa) and purple\nmilletia ( Milletia atropurpurea) to form a green screen which shields\nvistors from concrete towers that have sprung up at the foot of the hill.\n\n\nBreaks in the canopy afford historic views of the city that can still\nbe glimpsed from the once prominent hill.\n\n\nThe urban forest on the hill has grown to serve as a sanctuary for\nthe wild-life that eke out an existence in close proximity to man. \n\n\nThe flash of yellow of the black-naped oriole ( Oriolus chinensis) ,\nthe explosive blue of the collared kingfisher ( Halcyon chloris) and the\nmuted tones of the pink-necked pigeon ( Treron vernans) bring life and colour\nto the hill.',

{'text': 'Tales and Scales \n\n\nby Francis Leong Keng\n\n\n The Boas and Pythons \n\n\n Family Boidae \n\n\nThere are altogether about 70 species of boas and pythons found in the\nworld and they all belong to the family Boidae.\n\n\nBoas and pythons share some characteristics.\n\n\nBoth are constrictors and most possess vestiges of the third limbs\nwhich are usually present as claws or spurs on either side of the vent or\ncloaca.\n\n\nThey also have two lungs, though the left lung is smaller and may be\ngreatly diminished in the more primitive kinds of boas.\n\n\nHere the resemblance ends, for boas belong to the sub-family Boinae\nand range from 60 cm upwards in length.\n\n\nThese snakes generally give birth to live young ( ie they are\nviviparous) or they lay eggs which hatch almost immediately, a condition\nknown as ovo-viviparity.\n\n\nMost boa species are found in the New World, though there is an\noverlapping of the geographical distribution in Africa and the Indian\nsubcontinent with the pythons.\n\n\nThe Asian boas prefer arid sandy areas as they lead a\nsemi-subterranean way of life.\n\n\nThe pythons, on the other hand, belong to the sub-family Pythoninae.\n\n\nThey are generally snakes of massive proportions and great lengths\nand are hence well known in this part of the world.\n\n\nUnlike boas, pythons have heat-detecting pits along the lips of\ntheir mouths, are egg-layers and occur principally in the Old World of Asia\nand Australasia.\n\n\nHumid forests and well-watered areas are the preferred habitats of\nthe pythons.\n\n\nThere are about 20 species and sub-species of pythons occurring in\nthe Asia-Pacific region, and the largest of them is the reticulated python (\nPython reticulatus) which can attain an impressive length of about 10 metres\nor so.\n\n\nThis common and handsome snake is remarkably adaptable and can be\nfound in the dense jungles, areas close to water and even near human\nsettlements.\n\n\nBeing a good swimmer, the reticulated python also colonises numerous\noff-shore islands.\n\n\nThough the reticulated python produces only a single clutch annually,\nthe number of eggs deposited can be anywhere between 16 to 103.\n\n\nThe precious clutch is coiled around and incubated by the female,\nwhose presence effectively discourages common egg-raiders like civet cats and\nmonitor lizards.\n\n\nYoung pythons often frequent areas near human settlements where they\nprey on mice and rats, and hence can be regarded as beneficial for they keep\nthe population of such vermin in check.\n\n\nLarger reticulated pythons, however, tend to undo the good deed\noccasionally raiding the rural farms, taking fowls, piglets and even dogs and\ncats.\n\n\nAs a consequence pythons of all sizes end up being captured by the\nirate farmers and residents who sometimes donate the snakes to the zoo.\n\n\nI received as many 20 reticulated pythons during a particularly "\nproductive" month.\n\n\nOne can usually link the probable cause of this undesirable change of\ndiet to the shrinking natural habitats of the snakes, with the resultant\nscarcity of suitable natural prey.\n\n\nOn rare occasions, various forms of atypical reticulated pythons turn\nup in the steady flow of python donations to the zoo over the years.\n\n\nI was delighted one day when I opened a gunny-sack to find a\nstartling pale-coloured, wild-caught reticulated python, about 3 metres\nlong.\n\n\nEven normal reticulated pythons may come in either one of the two\nbody colour phases: those pythons in the dark colour phase are\nshort-tempered, while those in the bright colour phase are invariably\nselected by snake charmers and hobbyists because they are more easily\nconditioned to handling.\n\n\nThe reticulated python occurs in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand,\nIndonesia, Burma, Indo-China and the Philippines.\n\n\nIt has charmed many who have come to know and understand it.\n\n\nIts status in the wild seems secure for the regular field encounters\nand captures indicate that it is still common.\n\n\nBut one may ask, how long?\n\n\nAnother colourful python found in this region is the blood python (\nPython curtus).\n\n\nThis heavy and stout-bodied python reaches only about 3 metres in\nlength and it prefers humid habitats bordering waterways in the jungle where\nit hunts for small mammals, particularly rats.\n\n\nCaptive blood pythons are notoriously known to be difficult feeders,\nbut with patience and proper conditioning, one can induce some individuals to\naccept live chicks, gerbils and hamsters.\n\n\nI have recorded several matings in a well-established pair in the\nzoo, the copulations usually occurring in the early morning in the early and\nlater part of the year.\n\n\nRecently, they were observed mating in mid-May and it is hoped that\nthe female will at last produce a clutch of eggs soon.\n\n\nThe blood python is found in Malaysia, Indonesia, Borneo and Indo-\nChina.\n\n\nMy favourite in the python family is the rock python, of which there\nare two recognised sub-species.\n\n\nThe larger Burmese rock python ( Python molurus bivittatus) which can\ngrow to over 7 metres, is found in East Java, Burma, Indo-China, Southern\nChina and Hong Kong.\n\n\nThe rarer Indian rock python ( Python molurus molurus) occurs only in\nPakistan, India and Sri Lanka.\n\n\nBoth of these sub-species of rock pythons, when collected young, are\neasily tamed and hence highly popular with snake keepers, charmers and\nhobbyists.\n\n\nThese snakes adapt well to captivity and are easily maintained on a\ndiet of chicks, hens, rats and hamsters.\n\n\nAtypical rock pythons are quite rare and hence highly valued as\nexhibits and breeding specimens.\n\n\nI have known people who have willingly paid a princely sum of about\nSingapore\n&dollar;78,000 for a pair of atypical golden-white Burmese rock pythons.\n\n\nTowards the eastern part of this region can be found about a dozen or\nso kinds of pythons belonging to various genera, most of them occurring in\nthe Australian continent and parts of New Guinea.\n\n\nOne of them, the green tree python ( Chondropython virldis) is\nspecially adapted for an arboreal existence with its greatly enlarged front\nteeth, strongly prehensile tail and a long slim body.\n\n\nUnlike the Amazonian tree boa ( Corallus caninus) to which it bears\nstriking resemblance in both physical and resting posture, the green tree\npython is an egg-layer, producing up to 20 eggs in a clutch.\n\n\nThe baby tree pythons are brick red with white vertebral markings,\nbecoming yellow and then green as they mature.\n\n\nWild birds and small mammals are its natural prey, but in captivity,\nthe green tree python can be induced to accept mice, chicks, gerbils and\nhamsters.\n\n\nThe green tree python averages about 90 cm but may reach a maximum\nlength of about 2 metres.\n\n\nIt occurs in the forested parts of Northern Australia and New Guinea.\n\n\nAnother rare python which also occurs in New Guinea is the largely\nterrestrial and nocturnal white-lipped python ( Liasis albertisi).\n\n\nIt is so called because its blackish head is marked along the lips\nwith white and black bars.\n\n\nIts 2-metre-long body is characteristically cylindrical and covered\nwith smooth small scales which tend to give the python a beaded appearance.\n\n\nThe two adult white-lipped pythons which I encountered were hostile\nand kept striking the glass front of their tanks repeatedly at the slightest\nsign of disturbance.\n\n\nThe white-lipped python lays eggs and feeds on warm-blooded animals -\nin captivity it will feed on chicks and hamsters.\n\n\nThere are about 7 species of sand boas in the Old World, being\ndistributed from the Middle East to Northern Africa, eastwards to the Indian\nsub-continent and Northwest China.\n\n\nThe sand boa, as its name implies, inhabits dry sandy areas where it\noften spends much of the time buried in the loose soil or sand, usually with\nonly its head showing as it lies in wait for any passing unsuspecting prey\nlike rodents and birds.\n\n\nAt dusk, the sand boa comes onto the surface.\n\n\nIts slit-like valvular nostrils ( to exclude sand) and enlarged\ntougll scale on the snout ( to aid in tunnelling) are special adaptations for\na burrowing way of life.\n\n\nThe head of the sand boa is covered with numerous small scales like\nthe body.\n\n\nHowever, several longitudinal rows of scales along the back to the\ntail are keeled ( see Figs 1a and 1b) and rough to the touch.\n\n\nThe eyes are small with slit-like pupils.\n\n\nThe Russell\'s sand boa ( Eryx coicus) is attractively marked and\ngrows to between 49-90 cm long.\n\n\nIt occurs in West Pakistan, all over India and Sri Lanka.\n\n\nI have found this species to possess an unpredictable disposition -\nit may suddenly attack by lunging in a series of rapid sidelong slashes at\none\'s hand, inflicting bleeding wounds.\n\n\nIn captivity, it feeds on mice and day-old chicks.\n\n\nAbout 16 young are born in a litter, usually in the months of June\nand July.\n\n\nAnother interesting sand boa is the brown sand boa ( Eryx johni).\n\n\nSometimes also known as John\'s sand boa, it is uniformly dark brown\nwith a very blunt tail that resembles the head.\n\n\nWhen molested, it often assumes a defensive position with the tail\nsticking out of the body coils, thereby deceiving the enemy into thinking\nthat it is the head.\n\n\nThe reproduction and feeding habits of the brown sand boa are similar\nto that of the Russell\'s sand boa.\n\n\nJuvenile brown sand boas are lighter brown in colour, becoming darker\nas they mature.\n\n\nThey can reach a length of about l metre and are distributed\nthroughout the Indian sub-continent.\n\n\nThere exists a small but unique group of Boid snakes in the Solomon\nIslands in the South Pacific.\n\n\nThese snakes belong to the genus Candoia.\n\n\nLike the sand boas, they give birth to live young and possess\nvestiges of the hind limbs.\n\n\nAll the Solomon boas have the snout obliquely truncated, and the body\nscales keeled.\n\n\nOf the three Solomon Island species, two are described here.\n\n\nThe common tree boa ( Candoia carinata) can grow to about 1 metre,\nbut the average length is around 75 cm.\n\n\nIt is the most widespread of the Soloman Island boas, and occurs in\nthe forests, rocky and grassy areas, caves and cultivated areas.\n\n\nThe body coloration is very variable - being from light cream to\nbrown, brick red to dark brown with a darker zig-zag vertebral pattern.\n\n\nThe cryptic colouration helps conceal it on open ground among leaves\nand grass.\n\n\nUp to 20 young are born in a litter.\n\n\nIn captivity, it takes readily to white mice, and can be handled\nquite uneventfully if one is gentle enough with it.\n\n\nAnother species, the greater tree boa ( Candoia bibroni) is the\nlargest of the three species of Solomon Island boas, capable of reaching\nlengths of between 1.25 to 2 metres.\n\n\nThe body coloration is also quite variable, being dark grey or\nblackish with darker blotches forming a variegated pattern, this being very\ndistinct on the posterior body and on the tail.\n\n\nUnlike the former species it is largely arboreal, occurring in\nmangrove swamps, forests and even cultivated areas.\n\n\nThe greater tree boa hunts at night for small prey like lizards,\nrats, flying foxes and other birds.\n\n\nIn captivity, I have found this snake to be easily manageable, taking\nreadily to white mice and day-old chicks.\n\n\n The Blind Snakes \n\n\n Family Typhlopidae \n\n\nThis family of blind snakes comprises nearly 200 species which has\nsuch a wide pantropical distribution that it can also be found on some of the\nremote Pacific islands.\n\n\nThe blind snakes are generally soil burrowers, being small and\nworm-like in appearance.\n\n\nThey have specialised habits, with teeth only in the upper jaws and\nthey feed on soft-bodied insects and their eggs and grubs.\n\n\nMost species reproduce by laying eggs, the clutch size varying with\ndifferent species.\n\n\nAmong the larger of the blind snakes found in this region is the\nDiard\'s blind snake ( Typhlops diardi).\n\n\nSeveral sub-species are known, found in Malaysia, Singapore,\nThailand, Burma and Indochina.\n\n\nIn some parts of its range the Djard\'s blind snake is said to lay\neggs ( ie to be oviparous) whereas in others, it is reported to be\nviviparous.\n\n\nIt grows to about 30-48 cm long and spends most of its time\nunderground, occasionally coming onto the surface at dusk.\n\n\nI have collected specimens which had accidentally fallen into\nsteep-sided drains and consequently could not climb out.\n\n\nAs its mouth is small and barely distensible, the blind snake feeds\non small prey like lizards and worms. \n\n\nAnother smaller but more common blind snake is the Brahminy blind\nsnake ( Ramphotyphlops braminus).', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '41184219-d753-4eec-9252-069bb494ca7c',

Night-herons and a dozen of Purple\nHerons adorn an almost forgotten cluster of ageless mangroves that stands\nfrozen on the edge of extinction, in the middle of a prawn pond next to a\nBuddhist Temple.\n\n\nNo other bird sights - and this is certainly the last - in Singapore\nholds such a unique spectacle as Khatib Bongsu where the Night-herons and\nPurple Herons nest, feed and perform breath-taking acrobatic displays right\nbefore our eyes, as if we are part of their family.\n\n\nEvery evening when I return home from work, I see them flying over my\nflat to their coastal feeding grounds at Senoko, Punggol and possibly, even\nacross to West Malaysia.\n\n\nKhatib Bongsu radiates a certain magic both in sight and sound to all\nvisitors.\n\n\nThe Night-herons and Purple Herons nest almost side by side,\ncompeting for flying space.\n\n\nThe continuous woking and quacking of the birds echoing cries from\nthe dim mist of time produce a pleasant music that is soothing to the ears.\n\n\nThe only other known colony of the Black-crowned Night-herons in\nthis region is in Perak, West Malaysia.\n\n\nOver my three-year period of photography of the Night-herons, I\nrealised that they nest at all times of the year, fetching and carrying\nsticks throughout the daylight hours, especially during the first four hours\nafter sunrise.\n\n\nThe male Night-heron does the fetching of twigs and sticks to the\nnest site and passes them over to the female which assembles the materials\nwith utmost care and perfection.\n\n\nA home may take about two weeks to complete.\n\n\nTwo to three eggs are usually laid and fresh leaves are carried to\nthe nest after hatching to give it a soft padding.\n\n\nThe parents feed the young with regurgitated shrimps or small fish\nand often, a hungry chick is an angry creature, pecking at the feeding adult\nwith its wide-opened bill, some forcing it to flee.\n\n\nThe female never leaves the nest until the growing chicks outgrow it,\nand she is finally pushed out of the nest.\n\n\nThe young usually remain in the nest for about a month whereby it\nwill learn how to fly.\n\n\nI once saw a young fall from its nest into the pond and, well, it\nswam back safely to the mangroves!\n\n\nAmazing though it may be, it must be nature\'s way of ensuring their\nsurvival.\n\n\nI have seen fairly young birds pair off even before they assume the\nplumage of adulthood which is grey at the wings, dark on the head with a\nwhite crest.\n\n\nThe juveniles, in contrast, take on a rather speckled brown\nappearance.\n\n\nLife begins in full bloom at dusk when their " woking" cries radiate\nover the land.\n\n\nThey take off to their feeding grounds in flocks of ten, twenty or\nmore at a time, around the coastal region.\n\n\nThey return in the early hours of the morning and this period holds\nthe most exciting activities.\n\n\nDuring the migratory months, Little Egrets from the surrounding\nwetlands roost at their nesting haunts among the mangroves when they embark\nupon their nightly pilgrimage to the coastal areas.\n\n\nThere seem to be an age-old understanding between these two species\nof winged creatures.\n\n\nCrows, Brahminy kites and occasionally other birds of prey eye upon\nthis rich concentration of young birds.\n\n\nNeedless to say, they provide an easy meal and the parents of the\nNight-herons have to stay on guard against the natural predators.\n\n\nBrahminy Kites sometimes commit acts of " infant robbery".\n\n\nThe crows come in organised gangs of up to 80 birds to harass the\nnesting Night-herons, usually in the late mornings and evenings.\n\n\nIn the evening, the bulk of the Night-herons leave home for their\ncoastal feeding grounds.\n\n\nnesting females sit tight until the young are old enough to learn how\nto fly.\n\n\nDuring this time the male is the important life-line for he brings\nfood to the nest.\n\n\nNest-building, feeding, aerial courtship displays and territorial\nsquabbles take up a lot of their time during the active hours of the morning.\n\n\nThe intense heat of the afternoon usually drive them to hide amongst\nthe thick mangrove foliage.\n\n\nAs evening falls, they become active again.\n\n\nThis cycle has governed their life since their very existence long,\nlong ago.\n\n\nIt has earned these nocturnal travellers the name, " Night-herons".\n\n\nBesides the Black-crowned Night-herons, the other exciting community\nis that of the Purple Herons.\n\n\nA graceful bird, it soars the sky with its broad wings and is rather\ninactive at night.\n\n\nThere are at least half a dozen nesting pairs of Purple Herons at\nKhatib Bongsu and they occupy the higher tree tops which are located further\naway from human presence as they ten very shy.\n\n\nLike the Black-crowned Night-herons, the males are entrusted with the\ntasks of stick-fetching.\n\n\nThe young stay in the nest till they are about three months old.\n\n\nThey will depend on their parents for food even after that, lingering\nnear their nest sites.\n\n\nBy the fifth month, they can fend for themselves and they follow\ntheir parents to their favourite hunting grounds.\n\n\nSoon they will be independent of their parents and like them, will\nraise their own family in the mangroves of Khatib Bongsu.\n\n\n A LITTLE HIDING PLACE \n\n\nIn the quiet stillness of a warm April day, looming high amongst the\ngentle sway of the fronds, dangles the hanging homes of the Baya Weavers.\n\n\nThe warm mid-year wind is already here and while the wetlands echo\nthe silence of the bird habitats, now with only a few White-winged Terns in\ntheir dark-breasted summer plumage which have refused to return to their\nNorthern home, the trees suddenly seem to come alive.\n\n\nThe Baya Weavers are yet again raising their new families.\n\n\nIndustrious and unrelenting males work throughout the daylight hours,\nfetching long grass to make " helmet-shaped" nests to attract the females.\n\n\nOne male can build several nests to entice several mates\nsimultaneously nests.\n\n\nPolygamy, after all, is a way of life for the survival of the\nspecies.\n\n\nHeavily dependent on grass seeds for their source of food, Baya\nWeavers usually gather in colonies of up to 30 nests.\n\n\nWoodpeckers peck and pound the dead tree trunks, adorning them with\nan artistry of drilled holes of various dimensions.\n\n\nOf the five species of Woodpeckers here, the smallest of them is the\nBrowned-capped Woodpecker, slightly shorter than a 15-cm ruler, with the\nCornmon Goldenback, Laced Woodpeck Banded Woodpecker and Rufous Woodpecker\nvarying between the sizes of 25 cm to 30 cm.\n\n\nWoodpeckers are not the sole inhabitants of the dead tree trunks.\n\n\nCompetition for shell lead to other birds chasing them out of their\nholes.\n\n\nIn some cases, the Collared Kingfishers, with their unmistakable\nshrieking cries, too, make their homes on abandoned woodpeckers\' homes.\n\n\nEven the common Mynas sometimes rob the woodpeckers of their nests to\nmake them their own.\n\n\nBut the Barbets work on their own homes and we have two species here.\n\n\nOne, the Red crowned Barbet, is largely confined to forest habitats,\nespecially around our reservoir areas.\n\n\nThe other, the Coppersmith Barbet, is more easily located in nature\nparks and the surrounding islands like St John\'s Island.\n\n\nRed-crowned Barbets make rather hesitant " poop-poop" sounds,\nfollowed by 10-15 " poops" while the Coppersmith Barbets emit a mellow and\nmonotonous " poop".\n\n\nNow and then, we may find one or two Cockatoos flying over our nature\nparks.\n\n\nA pair used to make its home on top of a tree at Sentosa Island seven\nyears ago.\n\n\nVery likely an escaped species, it has since adapted to the living\nconditions in the wild here.\n\n\nOur tree-dwelling birds are plentiful and they can be found almost\neverywhere, especially in gardens and parks.\n\n\nThe Black-naped Oriole\'s strikingly brilliant yellow plumage with\nside dark bands around the eye and an orange beak, makes it a colourful\nhandsome bird.\n\n\nIts mellow whistling calls make soothing music even in the noisy\nconfusion of the city.\n\n\nA fruit-eating bird, it is found wherever there are fruit trees\nthroughout the island.\n\n\nAnother common fruit-eating bird is the Philippine Clossy Starlings.\n\n\nTheir impressive black feathers change to a metallic dark blue when\ncaught in the sun at certain angles.\n\n\nCoupled with the flaming red eyes, the bird takes on an impressive\nappearance.\n\n\nYellow-vented Bulbuls, too, often compete for fruits in the trees\ntogether with their distant cousin, the Olive-winged Bulbuls, a much rarer\nbird.\n\n\nSunbirds, Flower-peckers and Ioras are usually found where there are\nflowering trees and plants, especially so in isolated areas like forests and\nthe remaining undisturbed habitats.\n\n\nSunbirds and Flower-peckers are some of the most beautiful birds on\nour island.\n\n\nWe have six species of sunbirds, all sized between 10 to 14 cm, of\nwhich the now increasingly rare Crimson Sunbird is the most spectacular with\nits brilliant crimson breast, a shining purplish forehead and tail.\n\n\nPurple-throated Sunbirds and Crimson Sunbirds are not commonly found\nthroughout the island.\n\n\nHowever, the Mandai Orchid Garden seems to be one of the few places\nwhich these birds frequent.\n\n\nThe most commonly found of our sunbirds is the Olive-backed Sunbird\nand they can even be encountered in the heart of industrial complexes\nwherever there are flowering Callistemon, Erythrina or Russelia plants.\n\n\nThe Orange-bellied Flower-pecker and Scarlet-backed Flower-pecker\nnot only feed on nectar but on small insects as well.\n\n\n MUSIC EVERYWHERE \n\n\nSongs of birds are everywhere in the wild.\n\n\nUp in the air, deep in the forests, down on the earth and deep in the\nburrows.\n\n\nNight and day, rain or shine our feathered friends never fail to\nbring sweet music to our land.\n\n\nThe most familiar tune is that of the Spotted Dove or " merbok" as it\nis locally called, with their rolling whistled " coorroo-a-coo", repeated\nabout eight times.\n\n\nIn the long grasses, shrubs and vegetations of our fast-vanishing\nrural areas at Yishun, Sembawang, Changi and off-shore islands like Pulau\nUbin and St John\'s Island, thrive many species of small birds which make a\nmedley of sweet melodies.\n\n\nThe most commonly heard song of the grassland is that of the\nYellow-bellied Prinia that sings a lovely distinctive " chip-cheererere-up"\ntune.\n\n\nOccasionally, one also hears the rather coarse and halting utterances\nof the Pied Fantail.\n\n\nWhen pursuing insects it would sound like "\nchup-chupchup-choo-woot-cheweet-choowoot".\n\n\nAnd then, there are the Tailorbirds of which we have four species.\n\n\nThe Common Tailorbird would sing " chweep-chweep-chweep", the\nDark-necked Tailor bird produces a disyllabic " koo-chit koo-chit", the\nRufous-tailed Tailorbird calls " kuachi-kuachi-kuachi", while the Ashy\nTailorbird would make " pree, pree, pree".\n\n\nBut there is one sound which they all make when chasing insects and\nthat is " zit-zit".\n\n\nThe Lesser Coucal and Greater Coucal emit tunes quite similar to the\npronunciation of their names like \'hup-hup, t-t-tok" for the former and "\nboop, boop boop" for the latter.\n\n\nAs a layman, it is quite impossible for us to identify the exact\nbird by hearing their vocal cords, although it is quite unusual for someone\nnot to be able to make out the caws of the crows or the screeches of the\nMynas.\n\n\nThe melodious whistlings of the Magpie Robin hold such special magic\nthat they make just cannot be spelled out. \n\n\nTragically, their numbers have declined so badly there are only\nabout 20 left outside captivity.\n\n\nThere may not be any songs of the Magpie Robin that are sung wild\nand free anymore.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3a05c58f-9f7f-4149-a25e-46f347646e58', 'added':

{'text': 'Vanishing Birds Of Singapore \n\n\nLim Kim Seng\n\n\nThe Nature Society\n\n\n Chapter Three: PROFILES OF SPECIES AT RISK \n\n\nThis chapter highlights the plight of each of the fifty-two species\ndeemed to be presently in danger of extinction.\n\n\nEach species account is accompanied by details of ( i) conservation (\nii) past and present range, ( iii) the threats to survival, ( iv) habitat, (\nv) estimated current wild population [ A question mark ( ? ) next to a number\ndenotes a rough estimate, eg 50?], and ( vi) general comments illustrating\nthe main reasons for its decline, the conservation measures needs to be taken\nand the overall outlook for the future.\n\n\nENGLISH NAME: GREAT-BILLED HERON ( 1).\n\n\nSCIENTIFIC NAME: Ardea sumatrana.\n\n\nSUBSPECIES: sumatrana ( Gibson-Hill 1950) FAMILY: ARDEIDAE.\n\n\nSTATUS: ENDANGERED.\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION: Sentosa, St John\'s lsland, Lazarus lsland, P Tekukor,P\nBukom, P Sudong, P Salu, P Sakeng, P Hantu.\n\n\nSometimes visits the Pandan and Tuas coasts and recorded once ( 1976)\nfrom Sg Loyang.\n\n\nFormerly breeding but now absent from P Busing due to habitat\ndestruction.\n\n\nHABITAT: mangrove, islets.\n\n\nTHREATS: HABITAT LOSS AND DISTURBANCE.\n\n\nPOPULATION: 20.\n\n\nMeasuring a massive 1.15 metres from bill tip to tail tip, the\nGreat-billed Heron is the tallest living bird in Singapore.\n\n\nClad in a sombre dusky grey plumage, it is a frequent sight, either\nsingly or in pairs, along the regular ferry ride to Kusu and St Johns\nIslands, and at the coralarium on Sentosa.\n\n\nIts future is however less certain.\n\n\nSince this heron is only found in the southern islands, its continued\nsurvival is dependent on their fate.\n\n\nA large proportion of these have already been given to the building\nof oil refining complexes and tourist resorts.\n\n\nOther plans include the upgrading of the existing power station\nfacility on Pulau Tekukor and further land reclamation projects such as the\nlink-up of Pulau Sakeng and Semakau.\n\n\nOnly a few islands, for example, the live firing zone of Senang,\nPawai and Sudong, will be left as it is.\n\n\nThese changes to the southern islands could spell the end for the\nmagnificent Great-billed Heron.\n\n\nThere is therefore an urgent need to conduct a detailed survey of the\nheron\'s present range, especially the little-explored islands of the Ayer\nChawan-Merlimau group and the inaccessible islands of Senang and Pawai.\n\n\nPlenty should be put on the location of breeding sites and provisions\nmade for their protection.\n\n\nNSS has organised numerous cruises to the southern islands in the\nlast few years.\n\n\nThough far from comprehensive, they do give a picture of the existing\nrange and population of this bird and, more recently ( April 1990 and January\n1991), confirmation of the presence of at least one breeding pair.\n\n\nAn appeal is currently being made to the authorities to conserve this\nsite.\n\n\nENGLISH NAME: GREY HERON ( 2).\n\n\nSCENTIFIC NAME: Ardea cinerea.\n\n\nSUBSPECES: rectirostris ( Gibson-Hill 1950).\n\n\nFAMILY: ARDEIDAE.\n\n\nSTATUS: VULNERABLE.\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION: Found throughout the northern coastline from Sungei\nBuloh in the west to Pasir Ris in the east.\n\n\nAlso recorded along the West Coast and in the northern parts of the\nCentral Water Catchment area as well as the islands of Pulau Tekong and Pulau\nUbin.\n\n\nHABITAT: marshes, ponds ( brackish and freshwater), reservoirs,\ncoasts and mangroves.\n\n\nTHREATS: LOSS OF NESTING SITE.\n\n\nPOPULATION: 250.\n\n\nAlthough common throughout the northern and western coasts of\nSingapore, the Grey Heron breeds only in the remnant mangroves and woodlands\nof the Kranji River system.\n\n\nThey were about 70 pairs in this colony.\n\n\nUnfortunately, disaster struck in October 1990 when work to clear the\nnesting site, which happens to lie within an area designated for a new\ntransmission station for the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation, commenced.\n\n\nDespite a public outcry, work, which was temporarily stopped to allow\n28 eggs and 26 young abandoned by the breeding adults to be collected for\nsafekeeping by the Jurong Birdpark, continued and by January l991, the\ndestruction was complete.\n\n\nIn June 1991, 16 young birds were returned to their birthplace after\nsix months in captivity and three months of rehabilitation.\n\n\nAnother 11 are however destined to spend the remainder of their lives\nin captivity.\n\n\nFears of local extinction in Singapore shortly after the complete\ndestruction of the original colony led to their close monitoring by concerned\nNSS members and a complete picture of the reaction of the Kranji herons was\nthus obtained ( H C Ho, pc).\n\n\nAfter an initial three-month period when breeding birds hung around\nthe remnant colony in apparent confusion, a small colony was begun within 100\nmetres of the now-levelled original one.\n\n\nThis colony had 20 nests but was found abandoned in June 1991.\n\n\nAnother three colonies discovered since July 1991 in the same Kranji\nRiver system had a total of 40 active nests and action is now being taken\nwith the authority ( Public Utilities Board) involved to conserve the active\ncolonies.\n\n\nFurther exploration of the Kranji River System is needed so that\nexisting heronries can be mapped and protected.\n\n\nIt is hoped that this crucial area can be preserved as a protected\narea in view of its importance for resident water-birds, particularly the\nGrey Heron.\n\n\nENGLISH NAME: BLACK-CROWNED NIGHT-HERON ( 3).\n\n\nSCIENTIFIC NAME: Nycticorax nychcorax.\n\n\nSUBSPECIES: nycticorax ( Gibson-Hill 1950.) FAMILY: ARDEIDAE.\n\n\nSTATUS: THREATENED.\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION: Throughout the entire northern coastline; Central Water\nCatchment reservoirs; Marina East and South; Jurong Lake; and the islands of\nPulau Teong and Pulau Ubin.\n\n\nHABITAT: mangrove, ponds, marshes, reservoirs and coasts.\n\n\nTHREATS: DISTURBANCE OF NESTING SITE; PESTICIDE POISONING POPULATION:\n300?\n\n\n( formerly 1200).\n\n\nLike the preceding species, the Black-crowned Night-heron is a common\nand widespread species with only a single known nesting site.\n\n\nThis is located in a tiny one-hectare Rhizophora mangrove island\nbeside a Chinese temple at Sungei Khatib Bongsu.\n\n\nAn estimated 300-350 breeding pairs made their nests here together\nwith a small colony of Purple Herons.\n\n\nA proposal by the NSS to preserve the site as a sanctuary for the\nnight-herons was accepted in principle by the government in late 1989.\n\n\nThe sanctuary is to come under the management or the Housing and\nDevelopment Board as part of the proposed Simpang New Town Project and the\nfuture appeared secure for this species.\n\n\nHowever, tragedy struck the 1,200-strong colony in July 1990 when\nofficials from the Ministry of Environment\'s Vector Control and Research\nDivision ( VCD) started fogging the mangrove island for an entire week and\nonce a week thereafter till October in response to complaints by residents of\na nearby housing estate of attacks by Culex sitrens mosquitoes.\n\n\nWhether or not the mosquitoes actually came from the Khatib Bongsu\nmangrove was not satisfactorily proven by the VCD.\n\n\nThe results of this intensive fogging operation were catastrophic.\n\n\nAccording to the temple owners, the poisoned birds started dying\nalmost immediately and corpses of dead birds were present everywhere in the\nvicinity of the heronry during the months of July and August.\n\n\nThose that survived deserted their nests, leaving the eggs and\nnestlings to die of starvation and exposure, or to the mercy of the\nscavenging House Crows.\n\n\nBy late September, not a single bird could be found in the heronry;\nthe small colony of Purple Herons also vanished.\n\n\nAlerted of the disaster by a letter written by a member of the public\nto the press and by letters of appeal from the NSS to the various government\nbodies, including the Ministry of Environment, the fogging operation was\nfinally stopped in October.\n\n\nThe first returning birds were seen in early November.\n\n\nUnfortunately, these showed no interest in returning to nesting\nactivities but merely used the heronry as a roosting site.\n\n\nWorse news followed.\n\n\nThere has been no signs of the night heron here since March 1991;\neven the Purple heron has not returned to date.\n\n\nIs it because the area is still heavily contaminated?\n\n\nA detailed investigation, which should include the collection of\nfield samples, is needed to determine if the heronry is still "\nchemically-unsafe".\n\n\nPeriodic field surveys are still being carried out at Khatib Bongsu\nby the NSS to monitor the \'health" of the heronry in the hope that the night\nherons will one day return.\n\n\nSome of the " missing" night herons have since been discovered to be\nnesting in Jurong Lake and though numbers are still very small ( circa 20\npairs) protection is now being sought for these birds.\n\n\nNight herons are resilient birds.\n\n\nGiven the protection that they deserve, including the protection of\nboth nesting and feeding sites, they will be a continue to be a part of our\nnatural heritage, as they have for the last two or three decades at Khatib\nBongsu.\n\n\nENGLISH NAME: LESSER TREEDUCK ( 4).\n\n\nSCENTIFIC NAME: Dendrocygna javanica.\n\n\nSUBSPECES: None described.\n\n\nFAMILY: ANATIDAE.\n\n\nSTATUS: VULNERABLE.\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION: Senoko, Sungei Seletar Reservoir, Ponggol, Marina East,\nMarina South, Pasir Ris, Poyan and Pulau Tekong.\n\n\nFormerly Jurong, Simei, Ulu Sembawang and Seletar Reservoir.\n\n\nRecently, Sg Buloh.\n\n\nHABITAT: freshwater ponds and marshes.\n\n\nTHREATS: HABITAT LOSS AND DISTURBANCE; ILLECAL HUNTING/ TRAPPING.\n\n\nPOPULATION: 200.\n\n\nThe present rather scattered distribution of the Lesser Treeduck is\nthe result at a gradual loss of habitat to housing, industrial, urban and\nroadworks projects in the last twenty years.\n\n\nThe phasing out of the old-style aqua-culture ponds has also\ncontributed to its decline as it avoids brackish wetland sites like Sungei\nBuloh or Sungei Khatib Bongsu ( personal observation).\n\n\nIt is also absent from the central catchment reservoirs.\n\n\nThough common and even abundant in certain areas, eg Manna South,\nnone of the sites listed above is protected and its continued survival is\ntherefore uncertain.\n\n\nThere is also the threat of illegal trapping and hunting.\n\n\nMarina South, for example, is constantly plagued by poachers who use\nnets to snare unwary ducks ( as well as other waterfowl in the area) while at\nSenoko, " weekend sportsmen" have been observed shooting them for " sport".\n\n\nNumbers have plunged from a peak of fifty in February 1990 to the\ndozen now due to poaching and disturbance.\n\n\nThere is therefore a pressing need for such sites to be monitored\nregularly for signs of poaching.\n\n\nAnother measure is for the increase of compound fines ( currently\nS&dollar;1000) for those caught violating the Wild Animals and Birds Act ( 1972) to\nact as a more effective deterrent.\n\n\nUnless steps are taken to remove the twin threats of habitat loss\nand poaching, these engaging birds, such as those which frolic in family\ngroups in the ponds at Marina South to the delight of passers-by everyday,\nwill soon become a thing of the past.\n\n\nENGLISH NAME: COTTON PYGMY GOOSE ( 5).\n\n\nSCENTIFIC NAME: Nettapus coromandelianus.\n\n\nSUBSPECES: coromandelianus ( Gibson-Hill 1950).\n\n\nFAMILY: ANATIDAE.\n\n\nSTATUS: INDETERMINATE.\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION: WEST COAST, KRANJI RESERVOIR.\n\n\nHABITAT: FRESHWATER PONDS, MARSHES AND RESERVOIRS.\n\n\nTHREATS: UNVIABLE POPULATION LEVELS.\n\n\nPOPULATION: 20?.\n\n\nAs it is extremely localised in Singapore, the Cotton Pygmy Goose -\nthe world\'s smallest wildfowl - is highly at risk from extinction.\n\n\nIt is however classified as " indeterminate" in this study due to\ndoubts surrounding its status.\n\n\nIn South-east Asia, it is also assumed to be a resident as there is\nno evidence to show that it migrates.\n\n\nConversely, there are also to date no records of this species\nnesting anywhere within the region although it is present all year round (\nMedway & Wells 1976; White & Bruce 1986; and Van Marle & Voous 1988).\n\n\nWhatever its real status may be, the Cotton Pygmy Goose must\ncertainly qualify as " endangered" as it is only regularly recorded from one\nsite - Poyan - and the biggest flock ever counted numbers no more than\ntwenty.\n\n\nIt is only found in freshwater wetlands - a habitat which is in\nshort supply in Singapore.\n\n\nA survey of all existing habitat is therefore needed to ( I) survey\nsites for evidence of the presence of this bird and ( 2) assess population\nsizes and importance of sites containing this species.\n\n\nAreas with potential are the reservoirs of the Central Water\nCatchment Area.\n\n\nKranji Reservoir ( where there\'s only been one record), Sungei\nSeletar Reservoir and the largely unexplored Murai, Sarimbun and Tengah\nReservoirs of the Westem Water Catchment Area.\n\n\nBarring a surprise find in the above-mentioned sites, it would\nappear that Poyan holds Singapore\'s last surviving wild Cotton Pygmy Geese.\n\n\nAs such, they should be given total protection and closely\nmonitored. \n\n\nUnfortunately, because Poyan is also part of the military\nlive-firing area, it is unlikely that it ( Poyan) will be preserved as a bird\nsanctuary or that permission be granted to scientists to monitor the site on\na regular basis.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b0a0018e-d311-4f7d-aa7c-d06b64a0cab0', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.775297+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9482539296150208, 'non_english_score': 0.05174607038497925}
{'text': 'NUS Computing News Issue No 11 March 1992\n\n\nMicrocomputer ( pp 22)\n\n\n Windows 3.1: Is it Worth Waiting for? \n\n\nVicki Ching\n\n\nMicrosoft made a whirlwind in the world of personal computers when\nthey launched Windows 3.0.\n\n\nIt creates such an ingenious interface platform for advanced users, it\nhas spurred their imaginations wild in working towards that " perfect" system\nenvironment of high efficiency and great power; with no crashing, no hanging,\nand no UAE ( Unrecoverable Application Error).\n\n\nWord Perfect for Windows, Harvard Graphics for Windows, Pagemaker for\nWindows, Superbase 4 for Windows...nobody dares to doubt Microsoft Windows is\ngoing to be the most recognised and widely used Graphical User Interface (\nGUI) for the PC.\n\n\nThough news of Windows 3.1\'s release may bring plenty of Windows\nenthusiasts together for some hearty discussion, but your ranking of this\nproduct over version 3.0 is really very much dependent upon the individual\'s\nrequirements, needs and computing environment.\n\n\nI shall hereby provide a brief discussion on some of Windows 3.1\'s new\nand enhanced features, as well as how far it stands with respect to its\npredecessors.\n\n\nWell then, let\'s just start right from the beginning with a simple\nquestion: Have you scratched your head enough trying to verify the many\nquestions when you installed Windows 3.0; then Express setup is for you.\n\n\nThere is automatic detection of your hardware and configuration is\ndone to optimise performance.\n\n\nMicrosoft claims this to be one of the most dramatic additions: the\nuse of TrueType fonts.\n\n\nTrueType fonts are scalable to any point size, and what you see on\nthe screen is what you will get when you print with any Windows-\napplications.\n\n\nIf you are tired of Cut and Paste between different Windows\napplications; this new powerful feature: OLE, Object Linking and Embedding,\ncan be an enough and sufficient reason for upgrading.\n\n\nCreate an object with an application, and embed or dump it in the\ndestination document which can be in a different application.\n\n\nAnd when you need to make any changes to this embedded object, just\ncall up the application which created it, within the destination document!\n\n\nYou can link several documents to a source document; and change the\nobject from within any one of them.\n\n\nThe updated version is reflected in all the documents that have a\nlink to that object!\n\n\nThe only limitation: Not all Windows applications support OLE!\n\n\nFile Manager in Windows 3.0 wasn\'t a hit with DOS-command experts.\n\n\nVersion 3.1 retains its basic features, but a new look with added\npowerful features may change some DOS buffs\' minds.\n\n\nThis time, the directory window is split, with the left hand portion\nshowing the directory tree, and the right hand side displaying the current\ndirectory contents.\n\n\nYou can choose to display the names of files and directories with\nyour favourite font; or print a file by dragging its file icon to the\nminimised Print Manager window or icon, but this does not work with all types\nof files.\n\n\nForget about Windows 3.1 if you have only 640K memory; since Windows\n3.1 does not run on anything less than 1 MB.\n\n\nSo upgrade your memory board and be prepared for smoother and faster\nswitching between Windows and non-Windows applications; faster printing; new\nmultimedia features; enhanced serial-port support; context-sensitive help\nsystem; screensavers that can be password-protected and many many more.\n\n\nJust look at the number of forums that have been set up all over the\nworld on Windows and that of magazines\' editorial comments on the same\nsubject; there is no question on the level of interest and enthusiasm among\nWindows gurus; but it also proves one thing: that Windows can be a difficult\nand frustrating thing to deal with.\n\n\nSo whether the young Windows 3.1 can solve the seemingly unsolvable\nand intractable problems Windows 3.0 regrettably offers; or whether it will\nstop Windows users and programmers from crossing their fingers hoping that\ntheir systems won\'t hang again; or whether it will meet up to the\nexpectations of not just those who wish for a more trustworthy interface, but\nthose who have been panting for those " extra things" that Windows 3.0\nlacks...well, only time and the individual can tell.\n\n\nMicrocomputer ( pp 18)\n\n\n Why PostScript Printers? \n\n\nChong Chiang Seng\n\n\nIn the market today, there are mainly two kinds of printers: HP\nLaserJet compatibles, and Postscript printers.\n\n\nIn this article, I will examine the reasons why PostScript printers\nare preferred.\n\n\n PostScript compared with PCL \n\n\nThere are various reasons for using the PostScript printers:\n\n\n- one printer driver for all variety of PostScript printers.\n\n\n- all software that are used in the departments are able to print to\nthe PostScript printers.\n\n\nThis makes installation of software easy and simplifies the\ncomplexity of choosing fonts and cartridges for the users.\n\n\n- PostScript printer is more economical as compared to the HP\nLaserJet \n\n\nThe cartridges and replaceable items are cheaper.\n\n\nUnder the university\'s tender, the PostScript printers cost slightly\nmore but also offer more.\n\n\nYou have 35 built-in fonts as compared to 8 built-in fonts for the\nLaserJet \n\n\nYou have a 16 page-per-minute engine for the PostScript printer\ncompared to an 8 page-per-minute engine.\n\n\nPrinting speed will be discussed later.\n\n\nSuffice to mention that speed is a factor of more than just the\nengine speed.\n\n\nBut an engine that is built for higher speed would last longer than a\nlower speed given the same load.\n\n\n- PostScript offers greater flexibility and ease of use.\n\n\n- PostScript provides more features.\n\n\n- PostScript for compatibility and connectivity.\n\n\n Greater Flexibility and Ease of Use \n\n\nPostScript is a device and resolution independent printer language,\nunlike the PCL5.\n\n\nPCL5 ( Hewlett Packard Printer Control Language 5) like its\npredecessors, was designed for a 300 dot-per-inch laser printer.\n\n\nPostScript documents can be printed at any resolution on any printing\ntechnology.\n\n\nPostScript printers range in resolution from 300 to 4000\ndots-per-inch, and PostScript is available in laser, color, thermal, inkjet,\ntypesetter, and film recorder technologies.\n\n\nPCL is available only with a single marking technology at a single\nresolution.\n\n\n- Most applications provide a generic PostScript driver that will\ndrive most PostScript printers.\n\n\nWith PostScript printers, there is no need to go in search of the\nlatest driver to support a new printer.\n\n\nHP requires different drivers for each class in its family.\n\n\nFor example, there are at least four different types: LaserJet,\nLaserJet Plus, LaserJet II, LaserJet \n\n\n- PostScript is supported on many computer systems.\n\n\nPostScript printers easily connect to Macintoshes, PC\'s, UNIX\nworkstations and IBM mainframes and provide a broad range of print\ntechnologies for cross-platform support.\n\n\nIn fact, the PostScript printer driver comes standard on every\nMacintosh.\n\n\nPostScript delivers professional output.\n\n\nFor users who need sophisticated requirements and special effects,\nPostScript is a necessity.\n\n\n More Features with PostScript \n\n\n- PostScript provides color and greyscale support.\n\n\nPostScript printers are available with support for color and up to\n256 shades of grey.\n\n\nPCL5 does not support color and has very limited greyscale support.\n\n\n- There is more internal font support for PostScript.\n\n\nPostScript printers come standard with at least 35 built-in scalable\noutline fonts.\n\n\nThe LaserJet III comes with only 8 scalable typefaces.\n\n\n- There is an extensive selection of additional PostScript fonts.\n\n\nThe Adobe Type Library has over 550 PostScript typefaces in 120\npackages, with more shipping every day.\n\n\nAt present, there are more typefaces available for the PostScript\nprinters than for LaserJet \n\n\n PostScript for Compatibility and Connectivity \n\n\n- One file fits all - file format is portable to any PostScript\ndevice.\n\n\nThis means you can print the same files on a laser printer, color\nprinter, typesetter or film recorder and not have to spend time and effort\nrecreating, reformatting or modifying a document in order to print on another\ndevice.\n\n\n- One font fits all - font format portability to any PostScript\ndevice.\n\n\nPostScript can generate high quality fonts on any device from a\nsingle representation.\n\n\nPurchase a type package ( eg Helvetica, Times, etc) only once and use\nit with any PostScript printer regardless of vendor, resolution, or printing\ntechnology.\n\n\n- Easy connectivity for increased printer sharing.\n\n\nPostScript printers are easy to network.\n\n\nThey can be shared among many users thereby greatly reducing the cost\nper use.\n\n\nMost PostScript printers come with networking capabilities built-in\nor as an option.\n\n\nTherefore, you can easily share one printer among many users.\n\n\n How fast are PostScript printers? \n\n\n- It is fast enough for any printing and publishing application you\nmay have.\n\n\nPostScript printers are available today at rated speeds ranging from\nfour to 40 pages per minute.\n\n\nHow fast a specific document prints depends on the design of the\nprinter, how efficiently the application you\'re using communicates with the\nprinter, and how complex the document is.\n\n\n- For 300 dot-per-inch resolution, a text-only document will print\nout faster using a LaserJet III than a PostScript printer.\n\n\nAs more processing is involved in printing a PostScript document, a\nPostScript printer\'s speed is generally slower than a LaserJet \n\n\nHowever, recent development of RISC processors specifically designed\nfor graphics processing and PostScript has helped to overcome this problem.\n\n\nAnd Adobe is developing new controllers based on these latest RISC\ntechnology.\n\n\nIn fact, these new controllers are already appearing in the market\nnow.\n\n\n Conclusion \n\n\n- In an environment where you have to support Macintosh and PCs, or\nwhere you want to standardize on one printer type, it is good to purchase a\nPostScript printer.\n\n\nThis will eliminate the fact of managing so many printer drivers for\nyour applications.\n\n\nAnd at the same time, you are assured of future support from the\napplications you are using.\n\n\n Microsoft\'s Disk Operating System Version 5.0 \n\n\nby Ravi Chandran and Tommy Hor\n\n\nMicrosoft\'s Disk Operating System Version 5.0 ( DOS 5.0) was\nintroduced in late 1991.\n\n\nThough most of the major magazines have already summarized the major\nfeatures of DOS 5.0, I was requested by my editor to highlight the more\ninteresting features and to address the compatibility of this new version\nwith our current hardware and network environment.\n\n\n DOS 5.0 uses less memory than DOS 4.0 \n\n\nOn a 80286-class ( or higher) systems with at least 1 mega-byte of\nmemory, DOS 5.0 can load itself in the first 64 kilo-byte of extended memory\n( High Memory Area - HMA), leaving more conventional memory available for DOS\napplications.\n\n\nTo load DOS into the HMA area, you will need these two statements in\nyour CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n\nDEVICE = HIMEM.SYS\n\n\nDOS = HIGH\n\n\nOn a 80386-class ( or higher) systems certain device drivers and\nmemoryresident programs ( TSRs) can now be loaded to the upper memory blocks\n( UMBs) without the need for third party memory managers.\n\n\nThis again might free up more conventional memory depending on\nwhether the device drivers and TSRs work when loaded in the UMBs.\n\n\nSay you wanted to load the ANSI.SYS device driver into the UMBs,\nthese lines are required: DEVICE = HIMEM.SYS DEVICE = EMM386.EXE DOS = HIGH,\nUMB DEVICEHIGH = ANSI.SYS If you wish to load a TSR into UMBs through your\nAUTOEXEC.BAT file, simply add " LOADHIGH MOUSE.COM" in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file\n\n\n DOS 5.0 Shell. \n\n\nWith the DOS 5.0 Shell program you can now switch from running one\nDOS application program to another without exiting the first program.\n\n\nYou can thus switch from the current program to the one you were\nworking on previously and continue from where you left off.\n\n\nOnly one single program can be used at any one time.\n\n\n New and Improved Utilities \n\n\nDOS 5.0 has added new commands, as well as improvements to existing\ncommands.\n\n\nNew and useful commands include the DOSKEY command which can recall,\nedit, and carry out commands that you have already used.\n\n\nUNFORMAT and UNDELETE allow you to undo a format or delete\noperation, restoring your disk or file to its original state.\n\n\n On-line Help \n\n\nOn-line help is now available for all MS-DOS 5.0 commands by typing\nthe command name followed by / ? , or by typing help followed by the command\nname.\n\n\n Full Screen Editor \n\n\nA new full-screen editor to create and modify text files has now\nbeing included with DOS 5.0. \n\n\nThe full-screen editor which can be invoked by the EDIT command\nrequires QBASIC which comes with DOS 5.0.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7b6c58b1-1e27-4be9-b719-072564731eb9', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.776631+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9262404441833496, 'non_english_score': 0.07375955581665039}

\n\n\nGrowing vegetables in one\'s own garden is a common hobby for many\nhouseholds in the west.\n\n\nCan we in Singapore indulge in such a hobby.\n\n\nThe answer is yes!\n\n\nYou may find it more expensive than direct purchase from the market,\nbut there is some pride and joy in cultivating vegetables and harvest the\nfruits of your labour.\n\n\nYou need not require a large vegetable plot of land.\n\n\nIt can be lm by 5m plot or any dimensions.\n\n\nFor those living in compound household a small piece of land is no\nproblem.\n\n\nEven in condominiums and HDB apartments, growing of some leafy\nvegetables may be possible at the balcony in proper troughs.\n\n\nThere must be 4 to 5 hours of sunlight exposure, either to the\nmorning or afternoon sun.\n\n\nIf you are hesitant to invest on a proper cement trough, with\ndrainage hole, the cheapest way would to buy a few plastic bathtubs.\n\n\n LADY\'S FINGER \n\n\nThe seed colour varies from dark green white to brown and black.\n\n\nThe sowing process involves digging a small hole ( about 3 cm) and\nplace the seed into it and covered up with soil.\n\n\nThe holes should be sown about lm apart, since it is a woody shrub,\nabout 2m tall when matured.\n\n\nAt each growing point, it is advisable to have two sowing positions\nclose to each other, so that hopefully at least one seed will germinate.\n\n\nShould both germinate then one of them, usually the weaker one is\nbeing removed.\n\n\nThe seeds will germinate about 5 days from sowing, and watered at\nleast twice a day.\n\n\nThe new seedlings will appear weak and if sunlight is too strong,\nprovide some overhead shade.\n\n\nIt takes about a month for it to mature to a sturdy plant.\n\n\nThe stem is slightly hairy.\n\n\nSoluble fertilizer is used , since it is easily absorbed by the leaf,\nroot and other parts of the plant.\n\n\nIf granular fertilizer is used, do not apply it too near the stem, as\notherwise it may burn the bark and cause rotting.\n\n\nThe leaf is large, alternate and cordate.\n\n\nThe flower is attractive sulphur-yellow having a dark purple or\nmaroon eye in the center.\n\n\nNaturally when flower blossomed, ants and insects will crawl all\nover.\n\n\nAfter the petals fall off tiny bud appear.\n\n\nThe bud will grow into a full grown lady\'s finger in about 6 days\ntime.\n\n\nDo not delay the harvest as the fruit will turn fibrous and become\nless palatable.\n\n\nIf harvesting is late, the fruit is hardened when checked by a gentle\nsqueeze by hand or fingers.\n\n\nAllow it to grow to maturity and let the fruit to dry naturally by\nitself to brown colour.\n\n\nThe matured seeds can be harvested from the pods for future sowing.\n\n\nKeep the seeds in a cool dry place.\n\n\nInspect the leaves for any fungi growth or other infection eg POWDERY\nMILDEWS, because they impart a white powdery appearance on infected plant\nparts.\n\n\nThen spray it with TRITOGOL-MZ FUNGICIDE or other appropriate\npesticide.\n\n\nMake sure you can identify the correct pesticide for the problem.\n\n\nIf not, refer to some reference books or pesticide particulars from\nthe bottles or labels.\n\n\nTry not to use too much pesticides, after all the objective of home\ngardening is to have pesticide free vegetables.\n\n\nTry not to harvest until four/five days after spraying pesticide.\n\n\nThe lady\'s finger plant will continue to bear fruit for about 2\nmonths, during which period each plant produce about 35 to 40 fruits.\n\n\nThe fruit is a pointed and more or less cylindrical ( lOcm-15cm long)\nwith five ridged capsule.\n\n\nLady\'s finger is a delight for various cooking methods, for example;\na) fish head curry.\n\n\nb) steam it in a rice cooker just before the rice hardens.\n\n\nc) cut it to thin slice and fry it in oil with a bit of salt.\n\n\nYou can taste the natural sweetness and freshness from the the fruits\nof your own labour, literally.\n\n\n KANGKONG \n\n\nIt appears that there are mainly two varieties of kangkong are\ncultivated.\n\n\nThe aquatic form planted in the rice fields, provides a succulent\nleaf vegetable called the " WATER KANGKONG".\n\n\nThe other variety is the dryland form, known as " KANGKONG PUTEH".\n\n\nIt is grown from seeds as are other vegetables, except it requires\nplenty of water.\n\n\nThe leaves are long and slender and plants can be planted in a high\ndensity.\n\n\nIt is rich in iron content, and often fed to patients who are anemic.\n\n\n CABBAGE \n\n\nIt produces a large, more or less dense " head" of leaves from a\ncondense stem.\n\n\nCabbages are harvested after the " head" has been formed.\n\n\nWhen the head begin to turn white colour from green, indicates the\ntime to harvest.\n\n\nThe outer leaves\' protecting the head or in contact with the soil,\nwill drop off first.\n\n\nCaterpillars nest between the large leaves, and is their favourite\nplace.\n\n\nAlso, stagnant water or rain will be trapped between the leaves and\ntend to breed mosquitoes.\n\n\nSpend more time catching caterpillars, as they can camouflaged\nthemselves quite well.\n\n\nLeaves are eaten cooked or raw in salads.\n\n\n CHYE SIM \n\n\n( Scientific name Brassica rapa L )\n\n\nThe seeds are tiny dark brown to black in colour.\n\n\nThe seeds are buried about 2 cm below the soil.\n\n\nSeeds can be sown in a relatively high density pattern.\n\n\nThe seeds will take about a week to germinate.\n\n\nThe seedlings can then be transplanted evenly over the planting bed\nto ensure proper distribution.\n\n\nAll plants should be harvested within 8 to 9 weeks from sowing,\notherwise their stalks will become too fibrous for cooking.\n\n\nThe plants should be watered at least twice a day, with occasional\nliquid or solid fertilizer used.\n\n\nThe frequency of fertilizer used will depend on trial and error, but\ntoo much fertilizers would kill the plant.\n\n\nShould an infestation of caterpillars occur, either completely\nharvest the crop and replant with another type of vegetable, or spray the\ncrop with the recommended pesticide.\n\n\nSince a garden plot is normally a small area, pesticide may not be\nnecessary, but you have to spend time catching caterpillars.\n\n\nThe numerous caterpillars of moths, feed on leaf tissues, producing\ntranslucent patches.\n\n\nChye Sim are excellent for making soups and frying with other\ningredients, for various dishes.\n\n\nIt is relatively a fast crop, compared by KAI LAN and cabbages.\n\n\n KAI LAN \n\n\nThe leaves are thick bluish-green and oval in shape.\n\n\nIt is cut for the market from the young plants or before the first\nflower buds begin to open.\n\n\nKAI LAN takes a longer time to grow, hence it is more expensive than\nCHYE SIM.\n\n\n WASHING VEGETABLES HOW TO WASH THE VEGETABLES \n\n\nWash vegetables thoroughly to remove soil particles and\nmicro-organisms that are in the soil.\n\n\nPesticide residues can also be removed by a thorough rinsing of the\nvegetables under a tap for at least a minute.\n\n\nWashing can be done in a basin of clean water.\n\n\nIf so, you ought to change water several times.\n\n\nDuring each change of water, lift up the vegetables before draining\noff the waste water to avoid recontamination.\n\n\n FERTILIZERS \n\n\nThere are many types of fertilizers available.\n\n\na) solid or granulated.\n\n\nb) water soluble.\n\n\nWater soluble types can be:-\n\n\n THRIVE \n\n\n Directions. \n\n\nDissolve one spoonful in 4.5 litre of water ( two to an average\nwatering can) and apply fortnightly.\n\n\n4.5 litres of mixture is sufficient for an average sized shrub ( one\nmetre) for a dozen annual plants, six boxes of seedlings, or an area of\napproximate 4 m square.\n\n\n VEGETABLES \n\n\nThrive is good for all leafy vegetables, lettuces, spinach, silver\nbeat, etc, give weekly applications for fast growth.\n\n\nFor crop bearing vegetables apply immediately after flowers appear.\n\n\n FLOWERS \n\n\nGive all your flowers a flying start, apply Thrive soluble plant\nfood as soon as buds begin to show.\n\n\nYou will be rewarded with strong blooms.\n\n\n SEEDLINGS. \n\n\nApply Thrive solution monthly, in warm water ( first ensure the soil\nis damp).\n\n\nHelps keep them healthy and shiny.\n\n\nHalf strength for delicate ferns.\n\n\n SHRUBS. \n\n\n4.5 litres of thrive solution is the average for a shrub about 1m\nhigh.\n\n\nYou will find growth is good and blossoms last well using Thrive\nregularly.\n\n\n HORTI-SOIL \n\n\nHorti-soil is a natural product of humus which is made on the\nmaturation by intense bacterial action of a mixture of organic matter, peat\nmoss, medium loam and supplemented with inorganic superphosphate, muriate of\npotash, limestone, essential trace elements and a fungicide.\n\n\nHorti-soil will improve soil structure, has high water holding\ncapacity and will supply adequate nutrients.\n\n\nAuxins for promoting plant growth resulting in healthy and disease\nfree plants.\n\n\nWhen preparing the RED soil for the bed, it is best to mix it\nthroughly with horti-soil or other commercially produced compost.\n\n\n PESTICIDES \n\n\nThere are many types of pesticides available in the market.\n\n\nIt is a question of identifying the correct one for the particular\ndisease.\n\n\nYou may have to read some reference books or get some tips from the\nnurseries.\n\n\n EXAMPLES:   TRITOGOL-MZ FUNGICIDE \n\n\nTritogol-MZ fungicide is a new formulated carbamate compound foliar\nfungicide.\n\n\nIt is very effective in controlling a wide range of diseases on\nvegetables, fruits trees, flowers, field crops, turf grass, ornamentals and\nshrubs.\n\n\nIt\'s stable and provides long protective period.\n\n\nIt has low toxity and will not damage plants.\n\n\nRATE OF APPLICATION:- in general use 1 tablespoon to 4.5 litres of\nwater.\n\n\n CAPTAN 50% W.P. \n\n\nIt is a chlorinated hydrocarbon specially formulated to combat\nfungus diseases of fruits, vegetables, ornamentals and estate crops.\n\n\nIt is extremely effective.\n\n\nIt is also used as a preplanting soil treatment against soil borne\ndiseases.\n\n\nCaptan is compatible and can be readily used with most fungicides\nand insecticides.\n\n\n DIRECTIONS FOR USE. \n\n\n ORCHIDS, ORNAMENTALS and SEED TREATMENTS. \n\n\nAnthracnose, Black rot, flower blight, leaf spot, groundnuts, peas\nand vegetables, etc.\n\n\nApply a spray containing 10-15 gm of Captan 50 in 10 litres of\nwater, as soon as disease first observed.\n\n\nSpray as

farmland.\n\n\nThere were more than 20,000 farmers producing vegetables, food\ncrops, pigs and poultry, on small plots of land, averaging half a hectare\neach.\n\n\nManual labour was used intensively in the various stages of farming,\nsuch as land preparation, sowing, transplanting, watering and weeding.\n\n\nTO:\n\n\nToday, only two per cent of the land area is cultivated by fewer\nthan a thousand licensed farmers.\n\n\nUsing modern farming methods to save labour, machines are used in\nland preparation and sprinklers for watering crops.\n\n\nIn a greenhouse, such as the one shown below, well over 100 tonnes\nof vegetables can be harvested from one hectare of farmland, compared with 70\ntonnes from the same plot in a traditional farm. \n\n\n\n\n Bang & Olufsen BeoLab 8000

{'text': 'ACS goes cashless \n\n\nBy SUMATHI VAIDYANATHAN\n\n\nThe Anglo-Chinese School\'s \'smart\' card is a versatile piece of\nplastic.\n\n\nIt has a magnetic strip that stores up to\n&dollar;50 in credit and is bar-coded so that it can be used as a library card.\n\n\nIt also serves as a school identity card.\n\n\n" We use it everywhere; in the canteen to buy food, in the bookshop\nand library, for photocopying.\n\n\nI can\'t imagine doing without it", enthused Shon Mathew, 12, a Sec 1\nstudent.\n\n\nWhen the card was introduced last June, students bowled over by its\nusefulness, dubbed it \'smart\' even though it lacked the one essential\nprerequisite of its truly \'smart\' counterpart - a computer chip.\n\n\nAccording to property manager Mr Wong Wei Li, the school decided to\nintroduce the card because it wanted to give students a taste of the future.\n\n\n" We thought it would give students hands-on experience of a cashless\nsociety.\n\n\nA cashless school seemed the best way". The GiroVend system installed\nin the school is imported from Britain while the cards are manufactured\nlocally.\n\n\nThe system consists of an \'organisation unit\' - its brain.\n\n\nThe unit\'s hardware components include a standard keyboard, a desktop\nprocessor and printer that can display up to 24 characters and a magnetic\ncard reader and writer.\n\n\nAll cards originate from this unit which encodes the card holder\'s\nnumber and the monetary value.\n\n\nMini portable tills, each with a keyboard, microprocessor and reader\nare plugged into electrical outlets at all stalls in the canteen, in the\nlibrary and the bookshop.\n\n\nWhen the card is swiped through the reader the available balance\nappears on the display screen.\n\n\nThe operator then keys in the purchase amount which is deducted and\nthe new balance appears on top.\n\n\nThe system also includes a top-up machine called a loader which\naccepts cash and adds to the card\'s value.\n\n\nAccording to the card\'s manufacturer, Computer-Forms Toppan Moore,\nthe organisation unit costs about\n&dollar;10,000 while a mini till costs\n&dollar;7,00l. \n\n\nThere is no doubting that the card has scored points within\nthe school for various reasons.\n\n\nIt has stilled boys\' complaints about lost money or about being\nshortchanged at the canteen.\n\n\nWhen a card is reported lost, it is \'blacklisted\' to render it\nuseless.\n\n\nCanteen operator Miss Goh Ming Keow is happy because she does not\nhave to count coins at the end of each day.\n\n\nFor librarian Mrs Vadevaloo Sushila, the card is a time-saver: "\nEarlier, we had to keep written records of all files.\n\n\nNow, students just use the card".\n\n\nAccording to Mr Wong, parents have added their praise.\n\n\n" Previously, when the boys brought cash to school, parents were\nnever sure about how the money was spent.\n\n\nNow, they don\'t have to worry about their kids bingeing at fast food\njoints".\n\n\nHe says that the next step is to capture identity details of each\nstudent and employee on the magnetic strip: If it is feasible, we will go\nahead".\n\n\n Variations on a computer \n\n\n Composer Yan Hui-Chiang creates while his Atari system takes it\ndown \n\n\nBy EVA WONG\n\n\nComposer Mr Yan Hui-Chang used to agonise over a moment of\ninspiration and its long journey to paper - until he found his bridge over\ntroubled water in a computer.\n\n\n" In the past, I would get this inspiration, a tune or a feeling in\nme.\n\n\nI\'d try to write the notes down, but that took longer than what was\ngoing through my head, so some of it was lost," Mr Yan, 39, said in Mandarin.\n\n\nAnd if I was at a piano, I could play what\'s in my head, but when I\nwas through, there\'s nothing to show for it.\n\n\nIt was frustrating!"\n\n\nThen two years ago, he discovered computer-generated music.\n\n\nThe composer was then the principal conductor and artistic director\nof the Beijing Central Chinese Orchestra, conductor of the Beijing Concert\nHall Philharmonic, guest professor of the China Music Conservatory and\ncomposer of several award-winning orchestral compositions in China.\n\n\nBeijing Stone, a Chinese computer company, invited him to be its\nmusic director, to test its new computer products and software which helped\ncreate music.\n\n\n" Many of the older composers and conductors were suspicious of\ncomputers," he said.\n\n\n" But I saw its virtues when they demonstrated to me what it could\ndo".\n\n\nMr Yan, who is now music director at KK productions, a recording\ncompany here, has cut two albums of his own compositions in the past year.\n\n\nThe albums " The Moon" and the " Clouds", unlike his previous\nclassical works, combine orchestral and synthetic sound.\n\n\nThey demonstrate how closely the system can imitate the sound of\nnature and musical instruments, and how new sounds can be created by\nmodifying the computer\'s sound modules.\n\n\n" The sound modules put so many sounds and variations at my\nfingertips," said Mr Yan, who can play virtually every instrument in a\nChinese orchestra, and some Western ones as well.\n\n\nThe system\'s ease of use means music composition is put into the\nhands of the non-musician.\n\n\n" But I would like to think you need some musical ability before the\nmusic gains acceptance," he said.\n\n\n How the system works \n\n\nMr Yan Hui-Chang uses an Atari system in his recording studio.\n\n\nThe system is installed with the Sealab Notator software which\ntranslates digitally what he plays on a synthesiser into a music score which\ncan be read on the computer screen.\n\n\nThe system also captures the pressure on each key, the volume, tempo\nand timing, so when played back, the song sounds exactly as when it was\nrecorded.\n\n\nLinked to the system are five programs which imitate the different\nnotes made by musical instruments, voices, noises and sounds of nature.\n\n\nThe system lets him play all the instruments on a score by himself\nwhich gives him more control, said Mr Yan.\n\n\n" I don\'t have to worry that a musician doesn\'t play the way I want.\n\n\nI can be both composer and musician".\n\n\nThere are 128 musicians in a Chinese classical orchestra.\n\n\nThrough the keyboard synthesiser, Mr Yan plays the score of each\ninstrument, assigning each score a track.\n\n\nThe computer can capture more than 120 tracks per composition, and\nwhen they are played together, a symphony is born.\n\n\nBut the true beauty of the system, Mr Yan contends, lies in the ease\nof editing a score.\n\n\nWith manual editing, the composer has to erase notes by hand.\n\n\nAnd adding bars in the middle of a score is a composer\'s nightmare.\n\n\nOn the computer screen, that is all done at the click of a mouse.\n\n\nHe can transpose a score from key to key, or change its tempo,\nvolume, instrument and expression.\n\n\nThe entire system, with a mixer, speakers and tape deck, costs about\n&dollar;16,000. \n\n\n Brace yourself for digital future \n\n\n The progress of multimedia has so far been mediocre at best, but\nis it here to stay?\n\n\nYes, says IBM\'s multimedia expert Lucie Fjeldstad \n\n\nBy Grace Chng\n\n\nThe song " Unforgettable" was a piece of technological wizardry.\n\n\nNatalie Cole sang the song with her crooner father, the late Nat King\nCole in the song and the video.\n\n\nDigital technology made this possible.\n\n\nNat King Cole\'s original recording was electronically joined with\nNatalie Cole\'s version.\n\n\nThe result: a haunting duet which when shown during last year\'s\nGrammy awards presentation touched the hearts of millions of viewers\nthroughout the world.\n\n\n" We are in the digital world.\n\n\nWhat was once impossible is now possible.\n\n\nYou cannot imagine what is \'do-able\' today," said Mrs Lucie J\nFjeldstad, IBM Vice-President and General Manager, Multimedia Application\nSolutions.\n\n\nMrs Fjeldstad is responsible for the company\'s global strategy in\nmultimedia and high performance computing.\n\n\nShe was here in early March on a business visit.\n\n\nMrs Fjeldstad defines multimedia as the " marriage of the\nentertainment capabilities of television with the programming possibilities\nof the personal computer".\n\n\n" And what it does is it energises the senses - sight, sound, touch,\nand one of these days, smell," she said.\n\n\nBut its progress has been mediocre at best.\n\n\nTo this, Mrs Fjeldstad emphatically argues that multimedia is already\ninvading our lives.\n\n\nThat one cannot feel and touch them, does not mean that multimedia\napplications are not available.\n\n\nIn the United States, she says, IBM has been working with several\ncustomers who want multimedia to " augment their business, by making\ninformation available to them ( their customers) on a 24-hour basis".\n\n\nThe challenge was to " bring information to people through touch,\nsight and hearing, because that\'s the way people think".\n\n\nOne application was an information kiosk in California that, among\nother things, helps a driver renew his or her driving licence and find out\nwhat jobs are available.\n\n\nThe ATM-like machine comprises a computer and a touch-screen that\nallows you to instruct the computer with your fingers instead of using the\nconventional keyboard.\n\n\nFuture information kiosks can do more things, predicts Mrs Fjeldstad,\nincluding dispensing marriage and driver\'s licenses, stamps and air and\nrailway tickets, providing weather information and allowing the people to pay\ngovernment bills.\n\n\nSince the key word is convenience, new businesses have sprung up\nusing multimedia to offer their services.\n\n\nMrs Fjeldstad recounts the case of a specialty carpet store in the US\nthat was able to do away with its costly warehouses-cum-showrooms after\ninstalling several information kiosks in its 40-odd branches.\n\n\nUsers respond to several questions that appear on the touch screen of\nthe information kiosk to decide the type, colour, pattern and cost of the\nflooring they want.\n\n\n" You push with your finger and go through everything they have and\nyou look at it as if you are looking at your own room.\n\n\nAfter you decide what you want, you push a button to tell them how\nmuch you want and the computer will respond with the price.\n\n\nYou put in your credit card and they give you a date when it would be\ndelivered".\n\n\nThe key point of multimedia is its interactiveness and connectivity\nwhich allows people located in different areas to come together to do\nsomething.\n\n\n" If I went to the doctor to have a cat scan and the result shows a\nspot ( on my body) and he doesn\'t know what it is but he knows a specialist\nin the next city who could tell me.\n\n\nHe calls the expert and electronically sends him the scan.\n\n\nThe specialist calls up the scan.\n\n\nSo all three of us are looking at the scan simultaneously and then\nthe specialist gives me an opinion".\n\n\nWhen this finally happens - and it is not too far away, Mrs\nFjeldstad feels the whole medical industry will dramatically change".\n\n\nWorking at home, too, can be enhanced through a process Mr Fjeldstad\ncalls collaborative work.\n\n\nIBM has a customer who is a soft drink bottler in Atlanta, US.\n\n\nThe customer wants to create an advertisement which will also be\nused in Singapore.\n\n\n" If the US guy and his Singapore counterpart can create the\nadvertisement together, that is, they are on-line to each other and they each\ncan see the same image on their computer screens, they can work faster and be\nmore productive".\n\n\nWork habits will then be dramatically changed.\n\n\nBecause of the time difference between Singapore and the US, one\nperson will be working from home.\n\n\nWhen this happens, multimedia will begin to appear in homes, said\nMrs Fjeldstad.\n\n\nAs an extension to this idea, she said it could be possible for a\ndepartmental store to start direct marketing on a computer.\n\n\nShe would for example, be able to buy clothes without having to go\nto the store herself.\n\n\nShe can specify to the computer the types of clothes she normally\nwould buy.\n\n\nAnd the computer would pop these up for her to see on a regular\nbasis.\n\n\nShe would be able to select them and have a hologram of herself "\ntry" the clothes out for her to see.\n\n\nIf she wants to buy it, she would key in her credit card number and\nthe clothes would be delivered to her doorstep.\n\n\nFor all these applications Mrs Fjeldstad talked about, there must be\nfast electronic highways capable of carrying gigabits of information quickly\nso that data can be ferried from point to point without any loss of time. \n\n\nHigh capacity data networks capable of carrying 45MB of data per\nsecond has been installed in an American research and development network\ncalled NSFNet.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '528007c0-f4c3-44bb-97f5-1871f48484ca', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.778999+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9734463691711426, 'non_english_score': 0.026553630828857422}
{'text': 'Making connections What to look for when buying a modem \n\n\nby CHENG CHEE SENG\n\n\nWhen buying a modem, you need to consider features like the\ntransmission speed, standards and reliability.\n\n\nSpeed or baud rate refers to the speed at which data in bits are\ntransmitted per second.\n\n\nThe slowest is the 1200 bps modem and the fastest is 14,400 bps.\n\n\nAs a rough guide, at 1200 bps, transmitting an A4 page of text takes\nabout 40 seconds; 20 seconds with a 2400 bps modem; five with a 9600 bps\nmodem; and just two seconds flat at 14,400 bps.\n\n\nThings could he speeded up if the document is compressed to a fraction\nof its size.\n\n\nOr slowed down by the modem\'s error-correction facilities which\ndetects transmission errors and automatically orders a re-transmission, which\ncould double or treble the transmission time.\n\n\n Standards \n\n\nThere are two worldwide standards for modems.\n\n\nOne is CCITT ( Comite Consultatif International Telephonique) and the\nother MNP ( Microcom Network Protocol).\n\n\nFor simple data transmission you will need a modem that is built to\ncomply with CCITT V.21 ( 1200 bps) or CCITT V.22bis ( 2400 bps).\n\n\nFor faxmodems, CCITT V.27 means that it is a fax modem and faxes are\nsent at 4800 bps while data is at 2400 bps.\n\n\nCCITT V.29 tells you that the modem will fax at 9600 bps and transmit\ndata at 7200 bps.\n\n\nThe latest standard in error correction is MNP 5 that has a data\ncompression rate of 2:1.\n\n\nThat means data are first compressed to half its original size before\ntransmitting.\n\n\nIf the modem also complies with CCITT V.42bis, data compression is\n4:1.\n\n\nBut note that for all that to happen, both the sending and receiving\nmodems must comply with the same standards.\n\n\n Internal or external? \n\n\nAn external modem has a row of lights that keep the user informed of\nthe status of transmission.\n\n\nIt is connected to the computer through a cable.\n\n\nThe external modem can also be switched from one computer to another.\n\n\nPocketable modems, about the size of a chocolate bar, are especially\ngood for this as they have features as the desktop modems and are portable.\n\n\nFor example, a user can unplug one from the office computer for use\non his home computer over the weekend.\n\n\nAn internal modem is a bare printed circuit board with all the\ncomponents visible and is fitted inside the computer.\n\n\nIt is simple to install and does not add to cables and devices\nattached to the computer.\n\n\nHowever, it takes up a valuable slot space that may be needed for\nother card-devices like a Windows Accelerator or Network card.\n\n\nAlso, it adds to the heat generated from the electronics inside.\n\n\n Fax modems \n\n\nThese allow you to fax computer generated documents along with any\ngraphics without having to print it out first, a boon when on the road.\n\n\nFax modems cost as little as\n&dollar;300, about half the price of most basic desktop fax machines.\n\n\nThey also come with background sending and receiving features.\n\n\nThat means faxes can be received and automatically stored or sent as\nsoon as the fax line is free.\n\n\nImagine being able to read a proposal, add in some amendments and\nthen send them simultaneously to the legal, advertising and managing\ndirector, all with a few keystrokes. \n\n\n\n\n Microsoft\'s Database for non-programmers No computer degree\nrequired for effective use \n\n\nBy YEONG AH SENG\n\n\nMicrosoft\'s Access is the latest relational database program to enter\nan already crowded market.\n\n\nPriced at an aggressive\n&dollar;199 ( introductory offer only), it is likely to give cause for worry to\nrivals like Borland.\n\n\nLike all other Microsoft products, setting up Access is easy.\n\n\nJust insert " Disk One" into the disk drive and activate " SETUP.EXE"\nfrom the program manager and follow the instructions after that.\n\n\nA complete installation took up 15 megabytes of disk space, which is\ntypical of most Windows programs.\n\n\nAccess, unlike other database programs, manages the separate files\nthat makes up a database system into a group.\n\n\nInstead of using cryptic names like " seta.idx" and " seta.dbf",\nAccess allows you to use plain English to describe your database; files like\n" Students" and " Grades".\n\n\nThis is a very useful feature as it simplifies developing database\nsystems.\n\n\nHaving set up the database, Access lets you enter information in a\ncolumnar format.\n\n\nIn this view, it is pretty much like a spreadsheet, allowing you to\nresize the columns to view more information.\n\n\nWhat is missing, however, is the ability to resize columns to the\noptimum size.\n\n\nMicrosoft should have included this feature like they did in Excel\n4.0.\n\n\nYou can also create custom forms for data entry.\n\n\nMicrosoft has included a very nice built-in utility to let you create\ngreat looking forms quickly and easily.\n\n\nAccess also provides buttons for browsing records.\n\n\nThe buttons are, however, too small and too spaced apart to be\nconveniently used.\n\n\nThe query feature is good but rather awkward to use.\n\n\nI had to save the query first in order to change it.\n\n\nWhat Microsoft could have done is to implement a split window to\nallow the user to simultaneously view the query and the result together at\nthe same time.\n\n\nI usually make more than one query at a time, so it was rather\ninconvenient.\n\n\nAccess was somewhat sluggish on my 4 MB 386/25 with a Quantum 105 Mb\nIDE hard disk and frequently accesses the hard disk.\n\n\nAccess is a good database product with very neat features like Cue\nCards to guide me in my database creation and usage.\n\n\nRelating databases was just a matter of clicking and dragging the\nprimary field of one table to another.\n\n\nForms can also be created to view information from related tables\nsimultaneously.\n\n\nThe program also lets you create macros and programs to automate your\ndatabases.\n\n\nOverall, I find that Access is useful and promising program, if\nMicrosoft will trim it down a little to make it faster; make use of more "\ncheckboxes" than " drop menus" to make it easier to change field types and\ngive more thought to the user interface.\n\n\nOr perhaps I just may need more powerful hardware. \n\n\n\n\n Compaq\'s colour Contura goes 486 \n\n\nBy JANET TAN\n\n\nOver the past few years, I have been using laptops and notebooks,\nupgrading every 9-12 months.\n\n\nI using the Compaq 3/25 when offered the opportunity to use a Compaq\nContura 4/25CX recently, and it is the most satisfying to date.\n\n\nAs it turned out, I found little difference between the Compaq LTE\nLite 4/25C and the new Compaq Contura 4/25 CX, with the exception of the\nprice, the looks and the former\'s option of a docking station to house\nadditional peripherals.\n\n\nWith its 486 SL chip and 120MB hard disk, the CX can satisfy the\nappetite for today\'s powerful software requirements of the mobile executive.\n\n\nAdding a new active matrix colour display to it certainly makes\ngraphical software much easier to use.\n\n\nI particularly like the built-in trackball - a near-mandatory\nrequirement if you ever use Windows.\n\n\nNo more external mouse connected to the serial port - a real\ninconvenience if you are on the move.\n\n\nMost other built-in track-ball configurations that I have seen tend\nto be situated in the centre or below the keyboard.\n\n\nWhile these do not discriminate against left or right handers, it is\nprobably neither convenient to both.\n\n\nThe keyboard is sufficiently silent without losing that touch and\nfeel so necessary to know you have hit a key.\n\n\nThe " silent" clicking sound of the keyboard and alarm when you close\nthe screen makes the machine less of an attention getter especially when you\nuse it in a meeting.\n\n\nThe slimmer keyboard compared with the LTE Lite 4/25C, makes typing\nmore comfortable and less strenuous.\n\n\nThe notebook\'s batteries are now slimmer, and the Hibernation feature\nand improved Nickel Metal ( NiMH) type is supposed to help with power\nmanagement.\n\n\nBut each battery still lasts only slightly more than two hours,\nunfortunately.\n\n\nFor me, this means three battery packs to get any decent usage on\nthose long plane journeys.\n\n\nThere are various power management/conservation utilities which I did\nnot have the time to explore.\n\n\nThe Hibernation feature is neat in that you can place a mark to save\nyour work and power off.\n\n\nHibernation comes on automatically when the power is low.\n\n\nIn addition, there is the new, slimmer AC dual-voltage pack to power\nup the system and to recharge the batteries at the same time.\n\n\nRecharging also appears to be faster than previous machines.\n\n\nThe black-coloured design is sexier than the LTE Lite 4/25C.\n\n\nThe CX carries a three-year worldwide guarantee and pre-installed\nMS-DOS and MS Windows.\n\n\nAt a suggested retail price of S&dollar;6,152, the Contura does stand very\ncompetitively with other similar offerings. \n\n\n\n\n Unix six take on Windows NT power As the battle is joined between\nflexibility and power, who will emerge the winner? \n\n\nby Grace Chng\n\n\nComputer vendors are gearing up to meet the challenge posed by the\nimpending launch by Microsoft of its much publicised Windows NT operating\nsystem.\n\n\nThe six computer vendors - Hewlett-Packard, IBM, the Santa Cruz\nOperation, Sun Microsystems, Univel and Unix System Laboratories - have\nagreed to adopt a common set of technologies that will result in software\nbeing truly interchangeable on their machines.\n\n\nCoincidentally, Microsoft held a sneak preview of Windows NT in\nSingapore just before the global announcement of the six.\n\n\nWindows NT expects to deliver the power that is needed for\nlarge-scale complex computing functions that used to be carried out on large\ncomputers like mini computers.\n\n\nTherein lies the threat to vendors like the six who have banded\ntogether.\n\n\nThey supply organisations with powerful computing systems that can\nreplace bigger computers known as minicomputers and mainframes.\n\n\nApplications on these big computers run Unix, an operating system\nwhich allows applications, like payroll and database, to be used on any - -\nalmost any - - type of hardware supplied by them.\n\n\nWindows NT promises to deliver these applications on PCs and\nworkstations that are based on DOS and some Unix programs.\n\n\nThe cooperation of the six vendors mean that their hardware will use\nthe same technologies based on the Unix environment.\n\n\nTo users, they can mix and match the hardware and software of their\nchoice.\n\n\nSoftware developers now know which technologies to use to write\ntheir applications programs.\n\n\nUsers will benefit from this as the cost of software will fall as\ndevelopers need not write separate versions for different hardware platforms.\n\n\nPreviously, Unix applications were not truly interchangeable.\n\n\nThey had to be fine-tuned to ensure that they can run on different\nhardware platforms.\n\n\nCurrently, Microsoft, the world\'s largest software company, has a\nstranglehold over the PC software market.\n\n\nWith Widows NT, Microsoft seeks to extend its influence to the\nhigh-end computing arena.\n\n\nThe six vendors have received the endorsement of many other hardware\nand software companies.\n\n\nThey include Computer Associates, Convex Computer, Fujitsu, Hitachi,\nICL, Ingres, Oki Eletric Industry, Oracle, Samsung, Siemens-Nixdorf, Stratus\nComputer, Unisys and Autodesk.\n\n\nHowever, Hewlett-Packard, which initiated this move about a year, is\nnot closing its doors on Windows NT.\n\n\nSaid Mr Paul Chan, managing director of HP Sales ( Singapore):Buyers\nvote with their money.\n\n\n" If they prefer Windows NT, then we will ensure that our hardware\ncan run Windows NT". \n\n\n\n\n Digital music Minidisc style  Originating from Japan, land\nof the coolest electronic gadgets, is the sharp MD-MS701.\n\n\nIt\'s tiny, square, and ultra-cool.\n\n\nRetailing at\n&dollar;499, this is the ultimate cool accessory for the musically-inclined.\n\n\nIt plays and records, and comes with enough editing options to make\na Sasha/Digweed/Warren/Fontaine wannabe happy ( moving, joining, splitting\nand deleting tracks).\n\n\nWhat\'s more, the controls are well thought-out and easy to use.\n\n\nThe remote control\'s design is also something all portable MD\nplayers should emulate: it has got a head-phone jack so you can use any\nheadphones you desire.\n\n\nIt\'s finally cool to be square. \n\n\n\n\n Motorola StarTac X \n\n\nCome June, the StarTac will get even smaller with the new and\nimproved StarTac X.\n\n\nCompared to the current StarTac 90, the " X" model is smaller and\nlighter by 15%, uses the small SIM card, has a new " silky texture" finish (\nincluding a gold bat wing logo), and has a longer talk and standby time.\n\n\nThe " X" model also retains the

{'text': 'Pen-based organiser that boosts your IQ \n\n\nBy Salma Khalik\n\n\nSharp has come out with a pocket hercules.\n\n\nIts latest organiser, the IQ-9000, does almost everything you can\nthink of, plus a few more.\n\n\nOrganisers started as simple electronic diaries cum phone book and\nmemo pad.\n\n\nThe 9000 adds greater power and versatility.\n\n\nOne obvious improvement is the larger keyboard and screen.\n\n\nThe keypad on most organisers are fairly small and therefore difficult\nfor two-handed typing.\n\n\nWith the 9OOO many of the function keys have been moved to a touch\nscreen on the cover, freeing space for larger keys.\n\n\nIts word processing is very much like that of a personal computer,\nwith fonts, underlining and indents.\n\n\nLike earlier models, information can be printed or downloaded into a\nPC.\n\n\nA novel feature is the pen that comes with it.\n\n\nMy initial reaction: " a useless gimmick".\n\n\nWas I wrong!\n\n\nThe pen allows you to write or draw stuff onto the scrapbook.\n\n\nOne of my reservations - how do you write neatly onto a screen?\n\n\n- still stands.\n\n\nUnless you are a calligrapher who can write with your hand in the\nair, you\'ll need to rest your hand on the keyboard or edge of the organiser,\nand that does not make for smooth writing.\n\n\nBut that should not be a concern.\n\n\nThe pen is an asset only when you need to jot something down fast,\nand there is no paper around, without having to spend time opening the right\nfiles.\n\n\nThe advantage with any organiser is the ability to carry so much\ninformation, and space to write more, in a compact case that weighs just 430\ngrammes.\n\n\nWhen you have the time later, you can transfer the information by\ntyping it into the section you want.\n\n\nThis can be easily done as the scrapbook can be shrunk to half its\nsize and some other file opened on the screen.\n\n\nThe pen also makes using the touch screen easier.\n\n\nSure you can use your fingers, but the soft point of the pen is more\naccurate, especially when using the calculator.\n\n\nPerhaps what I like most about the 9000 is its filing system that\ncuts across all sections without taking up much of the available 125K memory.\n\n\nNo more frantic searches through schedules, memos and outlines to\nfind some piece of information I know I had put in but can\'t remember where.\n\n\nThe filing system lets you tag all material related to a particular\nsubject under one file.\n\n\nThere is also a search function, and again, it cuts across all\nsections.\n\n\nSo if you had forgotten to tag a piece of information in your filing\nsystem and do not know where you had put it, you can still find it easily and\ntransport the text to the right section without having to re-type it.\n\n\nAnother thing I like is the " To Do" function which comes in three\nsections - things you need to do, things you have done, and your goals.\n\n\nThis complements the Daily Schedule section, and gives the\nflexibility to put in things that need to be done, with no specific deadline.\n\n\nYou can prioritise the items, and easily change the priority if\nsomething more important comes along.\n\n\nIt would have been better if we could arrange the To Do pages to suit\nour individual needs.\n\n\nAs it is, one item has only one line of space.\n\n\nUnlike Sharp\'s earlier organisers which use lithium batteries, this\nuses four small alkaline batteries.\n\n\nWhile this might mean lower cost, the batteries do not last very\nlong, especially if the organiser is used frequently.\n\n\nAt an hour a day, the manufacturers say it\'ll last two months\ncompared to the one year lifespan of the lithium.\n\n\nFortunately, an alert comes on when your batteries are running low,\nand there is a Lithium back-up that only needs to be changed every five\nyears, so there is little danger of losing information.\n\n\nThe set automatically switches on if left unused for longer than 12\nminutes.\n\n\nThis prevents batteries from running down due to user carelessness.\n\n\nAnd while I\'m asking for improvements, how about giving the cover\nwhich holds the screen more than the two positions it can be opened at.\n\n\nRight now, it either tilts slightly back from the perpendicular or at\na l80 degree angle.\n\n\nPerhaps these are some things that can be addressed with the next\nmodel.\n\n\nMeanwhile, maybe I should trade my Sharp IQ-8200 in for this beauty.\n\n\n The new players \n\n\nby Yeong Ah Seng\n\n\nFIRST, the compact disc ( CD), then the digital audio tape ( DAT) and\nnow the two much-vaunted digital audio products of the \' 90s - the digital\ncompact cassette ( DCC) and the Minidisc ( MD).\n\n\nWhile the CD has virtually killed off the vinyl LP record, DAT has\nflopped by comparison.\n\n\nWhat fate awaits DCC and MD, the latest offerings in a crowded\nconsumer electronics market?\n\n\n Philips DCC900 \n\n\nTHE DCC was first launched in Singapore some months back by Philips,\nthe originator of the format, which introduced a desktop model, the DCC900.\n\n\nPortable DCC machines and dashboard models for the car are expected\nlater this year from Philips as well as licensees of DCC technology such as\nMatsushita, Sanyo, Hitachi, Sharp and Pioneer.\n\n\nLike the conventional compact cassette invented by Philips in 1963,\nthe DCC is a record and playback system for both pre-recorded and blank\ntapes.\n\n\nDigital signals are recorded on nine parallel tracks and there is no\nneed to flip the cassette which runs at the normal cassette speed.\n\n\nDCC cassettes come in 45-, 60-, 75- and 90-minute formats.\n\n\nThe DCC boasts digital quality sound with none of the annoying hiss\nprevalent in analogue cassettes.\n\n\nAnd it offers backward compatibility, which means that users can play\ntheir old cassettes on a DCC machine although recording is not possible.\n\n\nThe technical specifications are impressive and what one would expect\nfrom a digital format.\n\n\nFrequency response from 5 - 20,000 Hz, dynamic range of more than 105\ndB and signal-to-noise ratio of 92 dB.\n\n\nAs with CD and DAT formats, the DCC offers direct track access.\n\n\nDigital markers coded onto the tape when a recording is made make\nthis possible.\n\n\nIn addition, it displays text information such as album title, the\ncomplete list of track titles and the names of the artiste on each track.\n\n\nFuture text information is likely to include lyrics which can be\ndisplayed in synchronisation with the music.\n\n\nLike DAT, the DCC comes with a Serial Copy Management System ( SCMS).\n\n\nThis means that a digital copy can be made from pre-recorded digital\nmaterial but only directly from the original material.\n\n\nThe recommended retail price of the DCC900 is\n&dollar;1299. \n\n\nPre-recorded and blank DCC tapes cost between\n&dollar;20 and\n&dollar;25. \n\n\nSony MZ-l Minidisc\n\n\nCOMING hot on the heels of the DCC, Sony launched its recording MD\nplayer MZ-l last month.\n\n\nThe 64-mm MD, considerably smaller than a CD, is encased in a plastic\nshell like the 3.5 inch floppy disks used for computers.\n\n\nIt is a recordable optical disk.\n\n\nThe MD is half the size of a DCC tape.\n\n\nAnd like the DCC, it can make digital copies via magneto-optical\nrecording on a blank MD and play back pre-recorded MDs.\n\n\nThe specifications are also similar: 5-20,000 Hz frequency\nresponse; greater than 105 dB dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio of 95\ndB.\n\n\nOwners of Discmans say one of the biggest problems in using portable\nCD players is track skipping caused by vibration and shock.\n\n\nThe MD format addresses this problem by means of a 4-megabyte DRAM\nmemory which smooths out disruption caused by shock.\n\n\nSo even if there should be a break in data pickup from the disk\nbecause of shock data read ahead and stored in memory effectively covers the\ngap.\n\n\nThe MZ-1 offers quick track access and data on the track numbers and\ntitles of the individual tracks.\n\n\nAnd when material is copied onto a blank MD, there is provision for\ninput of such information.\n\n\nBut despite the MD\'s small size, the MZ-1 is quite large compared\nwith CD Discmans.\n\n\nIt measures 114 x 43 x 139 mm and weighs 690 g.\n\n\nThe incorporation of a recording mechanism may be the reason for the\nrelative bulk.\n\n\nSony will shortly be releasing a play-back-only model, the MZ-2,\nwhich should be not only smaller but also cheaper.\n\n\nurrently, only blank MDs of 60-minute duration are available but a\n74-minute blank MD is expected to be released soon.\n\n\nThis is important as a 60minute MD is not long enough for a complete\ntransfer from CD, especially for classical recordings.\n\n\nThe Sony MZ-1 retails for\n&dollar;l,000, and pre-recorded and blank MDs cost between\n&dollar;20 and\n&dollar;25. \n\n\nNext week: DCC vs MD, which is better?\n\n\n DCC vs MiniDisc \n\n\nby Yeong Ah Seng\n\n\nLAST week, this column featured two products, Sony\'s MiniDisc ( MD)\nand Philips\' Digital Compact Cassette ( DCC).\n\n\nToday, a look at the\n&dollar;64,000 question which many consumers or hi-fi enthusiasts are likely to ask:\nWhich is better, features and sound-wise, DCC or MD?\n\n\nIt should be noted at the outset that the Sony MD machine ( MZ-l)\nused is a portable whereas the Philips DCC machine ( DCC900) is a desktop\nmodel.\n\n\nThis means the DCC900 would have a leg up on the Sony in terms of\nadditional features and possibly sound quality.\n\n\nIt would have been a better comparison if a DCC portable was\navailable.\n\n\nBut this is not expected to be available until the middle of the\nyear.\n\n\nNotwithstanding the slight mismatch, a comparison of the essential\nfeatures of DCC and MD, and what music recorded on the two formats sound like\nyielded the following results ( see boxes).\n\n\nSONY MZ-1\n\n\n Pluses: \n\n\n· Provision for input and display of track information including\nartiste, song title and time.\n\n\n· No skipping of tracks unlike portable CD Discmans.\n\n\nThe MZ-l is almost impervious to shock save for the hardest thump.\n\n\nGreat when one is on the run.\n\n\n· The mini-disk is much smaller and compact compared to a DCC tape.\n\n\n· Multiple over-writing of the recordable minidisc would not lead to\nwear and tear unlike a DCC tape.\n\n\n· Sound quality emphasises mid and high frequencies.\n\n\nVery dynamic sound and ideal for pop music.\n\n\nThe MZ-1 also has a credible bass booster which can kick up quite a\nbeat.\n\n\nSound quality of playback from a CD transfer to MD is very close to\nthe CD original.\n\n\n Minuses: \n\n\n· The MDW-60 ( 60 minutes blank MD which is currently available is\nnot long enough to record longer pieces, especially classical music.\n\n\nUntil the longer MDW-74 ( 74 minutes) blank MD is available later\nthis year, users would have to put up with this inconvenience.\n\n\nMDW-60 blanks cost\n&dollar;19 each.\n\n\n· MZ-1 is a heavier machine compared to current CD Discmans.\n\n\nMore miniaturisation is definitely needed.\n\n\n· Unlike DCC, sound reproduction from the MZ-1 can be rather hard on\nthe ear over an extended period of listening.\n\n\nThis could be because the MZ-l, which is not really a hi-fi machine,\nis aimed at the section of the market which favours portable boom boxes.\n\n\nPHILIPS DCC900\n\n\nPluses\n\n\nComprehensive text information on tracks played; CD synchronisation\nfor easy transfer from a CD; clear track, time and recording mode displays;\nand ease of editing.\n\n\nUnlike analogue cassette recordings where one has to wind the tape\nto a tapecounter setting determined by an educated guess, access to\nindividual tracks is quick.\n\n\nDCC tape advances to the exact starting point of any track when a\nbutton is pressed.\n\n\nSimilarly for rewind to previous tracks.\n\n\nSound quality of playback from pre-recorded DCCs is excellent.\n\n\nSmooth, dynamic and definitely high-quality reproduction which is\neasy on the ear.\n\n\nSound quality of playback from CD transfer to DCC is also good.\n\n\nThere is some very minor loss in the high frequencies but overall,\nthe reproduction is quite faithful to the original source.\n\n\nWide range of software available because of Philips\' close\naffiliation to Polygram, a major music software distributor.\n\n\nDCC blanks cost:\n&dollar;15 for 90 mins;\n&dollar;13.50 for 75 mins;\n&dollar;l2 for 60 mins; and\n&dollar;11 for 45 mins. \n\n\nMinuses:\n\n\n* Compared to MD, DCC track access is slow as it takes time to wind\nthe tape to a particular spot.\n\n\n· As with all tape devices, there is the likelihood of tape wear\nover the long term.\n\n\nDigital Audio Tape ( DAT) suffers from this disadvantage as well.\n\n\n· DCC\'s backward compatibility feature, which allows analogue\ncassettes to be played on DCC machines, can be a drawback.\n\n\nSome old analogue cassettes can be quite grotty or even\nfungus-ridden.\n\n\nWhat that does to the DCC heads is unimaginable.\n\n\n· Sound quality from playback of analogue cassettes passable but\ndefinitely not up to the standard of reproduction on a high-quality deck like\nNakamichi.\n\n\nOVERALL, I preferred the sound of the DCC.\n\n\nBut in terms of size and portability, the MD comes out ahead.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'f69c8468-c0a7-4670-8760-db905a678f9d', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.781524+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': 'Electronic mail anywhere \n\n\nby Joanne Lee\n\n\nA NEW super-pager device for people who need to receive electronic\nmessages out in the field may be launched soon.\n\n\nIt will enable them to receive numerical messages from telephones (\nlike a normal pager) and electronic mail from desktop PCs.\n\n\nThey will need a Hewlett Packard HP 95LX palmtop computer and a\nreceiving device called the Motorola News Stream.\n\n\nA desktop PC running a special software from Hewlett Packard will be\nable to send messages of up to 400 characters to a palmtop or a group of\npalmtops anywhere in Singapore.\n\n\nThe messages will be automatically directed to update appointments,\nspreadsheets, telephone directories and to-do lists in the palmtop.\n\n\nOne of the first target groups of users will be forex dealers, who\nwill be able to receive instantaneous updates of financial information from\nReuters Information Services, HP told Life!\n\n\nIt is negotiating with Singapore Telecom and Reuters Information\nServices on the details about the new service.\n\n\nForex dealers can already receive the Reuters service through a\nspecial pager that allows them to see the incoming information line by line.\n\n\nThe HP system, however, can display a whole screen of 400 characters\nat a time.\n\n\nIf the negotiations come through, Singapore will be one of the few\nforex markets in the world with this service, HP said.\n\n\nNegotiations for a service in Hong Kong is under way.\n\n\nLaunched in April 1990, the HP 95LX has a list price of\n&dollar;800 for the 512 kilobyte RAM and\n&dollar;1,200 for the new 1 megabyte RAM.\n\n\nBut they will be on offer at\n&dollar;576 and\n&dollar;980 respectively until June 1.\n\n\nThe palmtop comes with built-in software such as the MS-DOS\noperating system, the Lotus 1-2-3, an advanced financial calculator, data\ncommunications software, a memo-editor, phone book and appointment book.\n\n\nThe Motorola NewsStream receiver, which costs\n&dollar;500, is sold separately. \n\n\n\n\n How safe is your system? \n\n\nDespite proposed laws against misuse, computers everywhere are at\nrisk\n\n\nby Grace Chng\n\n\nOn Mar 6, an electronic virus named Michelangelo struck computer\nsystems around the world, wreaking untold havoc.\n\n\nA fortnight ago, two hackers in the US pleaded guilty to breaking\ninto computer systems in what US authorities termed " crimes of the future".\n\n\nMeanwhile, a 19-year-old British youth was found not guilty for\nbreaking into computer systems including those of the Ministry for Defence.\n\n\nSingapore is not immune to the activities of such criminals.\n\n\nAnd it is to protect against them that the proposed computer misuse\nlaw was introduced earlier this month in parliament.\n\n\nThe Computer Misuse Bill is intended on cracking down on computer\ncrimes here as well as those crimes committed from outside the country via\ntelephone lines but affect systems in Singapore.\n\n\nAccording to Prof Chin Tet Yung, Dean of the Law Faculty, National\nUniversity of Singapore, laws against computer misuse were not introduced\nearlier because " the problem had not become that great even on a global\nbasis".\n\n\nThe laws are now needed here as Singapore is in an advanced stage of\nits computerisation programme.\n\n\nThe threat will be increased as Singapore implements IT2000, a\nblue-print that will see Singapore criss-crossed by electronic highways which\nare ultimately plugged into global networks.\n\n\nThese electronic links can be accessed by a hacker anywhere in the\nworld equipped with only a computer.\n\n\n" This seems remote," said Prof Chin, " but once we are\nelectronically linked to the rest of the world, such activities can happen".\n\n\nProf Chin, who is also the chairman of the sub-committee on computer\ntechnology and the law at the Singapore Academy of Law, sees enormous\nsecurity risks in the proliferation of networking in organisations.\n\n\nHe cited an example: " A medical database contains patients\' data\navailable only to doctors.\n\n\nBut what if someone gains unauthorised access to the data and changes\nvital information such as medication?\n\n\nLives can be endangered".\n\n\nThe laws, when they come into effect, will help deter misuse,\nespecially by casual hackers.\n\n\nBut laws can do only so much to protect computer users.\n\n\nOrganisations need to take preventive measures to protect from data\nloss and virus attacks, and also against computer frauds and breakdowns.\n\n\nSaid Prof Chin: " What is more necessary than laws is the creation of\nawareness among computer professionals and users on the need for security".\n\n\nCertainly, awareness has been growing in recent years, as reflected\nin the increasing number of computer security conferences here.\n\n\nMedia publicity on the Michelangelo and other viruses as well as\noffenders who access computer systems illegally have also helped in damage\ncontrol.\n\n\nMr Chew Teck Soon, a partner with management consultants Coopers and\nLybrand, believes that with the mushrooming of international data networking,\nthere needs to be an authority that can police the flow of information across\nborders.\n\n\nThis is still a very grey area at the moment, he said.\n\n\n" Countries have incorporated it into their legislation in terms of\ndefining their scope of where and what they can prosecute".\n\n\nThe recently introduced Computer Misuse Bill has included this\ntrans-border data flow crimes.\n\n\nThe bill covers offences on computer systems here or committed from\noutside the country via telephone lines.\n\n\nBeyond that, Prof Chin of NUS\'s Law Faculty sees a need for a " code\nof conduct for computer professionals not only for security but also for data\nprotection and privacy".\n\n\nAdded Coopers\' Mr Chew: " The group of young adults proficient in\ncomputers is growing.\n\n\nIf the ethics of these people is not managed well, we stand a greater\nrisk of a juvenile delinquent breaking into a system here".\n\n\nAt the end of the day, however, the toughest laws and the most\nsophisticated security system will not keep out the most determined of\ncriminals.\n\n\nThe problem then is having people who know how to nab the electronic\ncriminals.\n\n\nThe traditional policeman is no longer enough.\n\n\nThe new-age law enforcer is more likely to be the savvy computer\nwizard who understands electronic pulses and cyberspace - - the area between\ntwo computers - - to be a hacker. \n\n\n\n\n Inside DOS 6 \n\n\nDOS 6, the long-awaited update to the most widely-used operating\nsoftware in the world, DOS 5, is now out.\n\n\nFrancis Chin gives it the once-over.\n\n\nMicrosoft\'s DOS version 6 is now available.\n\n\nDOS, or Disk Operating System, controls the entire working of the\npersonal computer, from the XT to the top-of-the-line 486/66 machine.\n\n\nCurrently, almost users have MS-DOS 5 in their PCs.\n\n\nThere is only one competitor\'s operating system, known as DR-DOS ( DR\nstands for Digital Research), which can replace Microsoft\'s system.\n\n\nDR-DOS is more powerful, has more features and functions, and is no\nmore difficult to use than MS-DOS.\n\n\nVery few people have heard of DR-DOS because of poor or non-existent\npromotion and marketing.\n\n\nMS-DOS 6 is intended to solve two common problems: insufficient\nconventional memory and a full hard disk.\n\n\n Conventional memory \n\n\nAll PCs running on DOS have only 640 kilobytes of processing memory\nto access and handle application programs.\n\n\nThis 640K is the limit, regardless of the millions of bytes of RAM\nyou may have put inside the machine.\n\n\nSo, you have the weird but very common situation in which you have 4\nmillion bytes of RAM and your computer uses only 640,000 bytes.\n\n\nThe other 3,380,000 bytes appear to be idle and quite useless.\n\n\nMeanwhile, of the 640K, a bit goes to handling your mouse, a bit goes\nto taking care of your sound card, a bit goes to disk-caching ( faster\ntransfer of data from the hard disk to the processor) and a bit goes to other\ndevices hooked to the PC.\n\n\nAll these bits add up and usually you are left with say 550K of\nconventional memory.\n\n\nWhen you start your favourite word processor programme or flight\nsimulator game, you get this message on screen: insufficient memory.\n\n\nYou read the box cover of your game again and there in small print it\nsays: This game requires 600K of memory.\n\n\nDrat!\n\n\nFor a company thought to be run by pretty smart people, you wonder\nwhy Microsoft gives you the dumb 640K limit, leaving out those millions of\nbytes you still have in the rest of your RAM chips.\n\n\nIn MS-DOS 5, Microsoft tried to redeem itself by creating upper\nmemory segments, expanded memory and extended memory.\n\n\nAll those bits of memory needed for your mouse, disk-cache, sound\ncard and other devices can be taken from upper memory which is something\nabove the 640K conventional memory.\n\n\nWith odd commands like DEVICEHIGH and LOADHIGH, you now have 610K,\nwhich is just adequate to fly your F-15 simulated jet over Baghdad, complete\nwith the roar of the after-burners and the whistling of the wind over your\nPlexiglass cockpit.\n\n\nThe new MS-DOS 6 offers more of the same memory juggling feature\nwhich now goes by the fancy name of MemMaker.\n\n\nAlready in the past week since a review in Singapore, power users are\nname-dropping MemMaker in their conversation the way you toss ketchup on\nstale spaghetti.\n\n\nPersonally, I do not see much difference in what Memmaker can do\ncompared with what MS-DOS 5 has already accomplished.\n\n\n Hard-Disk Capacity \n\n\nIt is an iron-clad law that data and application programmes expand\nfaster than the hard disk can store them.\n\n\nThree years back, a 40MB hard disk was quite capacious; now a 200MB\ndisk ( at\n&dollar;900) is barely enough.\n\n\nNow Microsoft says that with MS-DOS 6, you can temporarily halt this\nmadness of changing your hard disk every year.\n\n\nIt offers a feature, called DoubleSpace, which squeezes the data\ninside the hard disk to half their normal size, in effect doubling the\nstorage.\n\n\nSo a 200MB disk becomes a virtual 400MB, using DoubleSpace.\n\n\nThe squeeze on your data is safe and you need not bother how it\nworks.\n\n\nNow you can throw away Stacker 3.0 ( if you are using a pirated copy\nbought for\n&dollar;5 at Katong Shopping Center), a special software from Stac Electronics that\ndoes basically the same thing.\n\n\nThere is something not quite right here: originally Microsoft wanted\nto use the Stacker technique for its DoubleSpace.\n\n\nIt discussed this with Stac Electronics, then said it could do it\nwithout Stac\'s assistance.\n\n\nStac has since sued Microsoft in a Los Angeles court for alleged\nstealing of its patented techniques and using them in DoubleSpace.\n\n\nMicrosoft officials in Singapore say what is employed inside\nDoubleSpace has nothing to do with Stac\'s patents.\n\n\nBut they declined to comment further.\n\n\n Other features \n\n\nDOS 6 throws in lots of extras to make your daily housekeeping chores\nless tedious.\n\n\n* Backup facility ( in a DOS and Windows version) for fast backup of\ndata from the hard disk to floppies and tapes.\n\n\n* Anti-virus protection scheme to scan, detect and destroy viruses.\n\n\n* Undelete to bring back to life the file you have deleted.\n\n\n* Defrag for " unfragmentising" files and data that are scattered in\na mess on the hard disk.\n\n\n* Three new commands for the C prompt - - MOVE, DELTREE and CHOICE.\n\n\n Prices \n\n\nThe DOS 6 package that you can buy off the shelf is for upgrading\nonly.\n\n\nThis means that your computer must have already been running any\nearlier version of DOS.\n\n\nThe installation of DOS 6 will overwrite the old systems files.\n\n\nDOS 6 is priced at\n&dollar;99.95. \n\n\nMicrosoft Corporation says all major PC manufacturers are\nexpected to pre-install DOS 6 in their new machines.\n\n\nSo, should you move to DOS 6?\n\n\nIf you have just bought a PC, definitely.\n\n\nIf you are already using DOS 5 plus pirated versions of utility\nsoftware like PC tools, Norton Desktop and Stacker, definitely.\n\n\nBut if you have bought original copies of the above utilities (\nwhich can total over\n&dollar;500), do not make the switch just yet.\n\n\nWait and see. \n\n\n\n\n 3Com Palm Death of the Filofax? \n\n\nPalm Computing, Inc., a 3Com company has produced the third\ngeneration of its award-winning and highly popular Palmpilot: the Palm \n\n\nWith more than a million units of its predecessor the PalmPilot sold\nworldwide, this latest gadget looks set to become the preferred product for\ndigital organiser users here and abroad.\n\n\nThe new palm III looks much sleeker, with softer edges all around\nand even a protective flip cover to make this essential gadget look like a\nStar Trek Tricoder only slimmer. \n\n\nWeighing in at just 6 ounces, this " can-do" machine comes with 2\nmegabytes of memory, stores 6,000 addresses, 1,500 " to-do" items, 1,500\nmemos, 200 e-mail messages, and 3,000 appointments.\n\n\nwhat\'s more, it features improved handwriting recognition and\ninfra-red capabilities for easy data transferral.\n\n\nThe Palm organiser applications include a date book, address\nbook, mail, " to do" list, memo pad, expense, calculator, games, and a\nHotSync feature for easy exchange of data to and from your desktop computer.\n\n\nNow all you need is a teleport device to beam you from the\nthousands of places you have to be today.\n\n\nI\'ve thought of enquiring with 3Com but I don\'t think they are\nworking on it yet.\n\n\nTsk.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL',

Kevin Lim\n\n\nComfortably lounging on a sofa in his three-room HDB apartment, Mr Tan\nreaches for his TV remote control to check which Sharon Stone movies are\navailable on TV.\n\n\nHe considers Basic Instinct but finally chooses Crocodile Dundee.\n\n\nHalfway through, he presses " Pause" on the remote to stop the movie.\n\n\nHe calls up another function, and orders a pizza from a menu which\nappears on the TV screen.\n\n\nHe presses " Start" to continue watching the movie until the delivery\nboy shows up with his pizza a while later.\n\n\nThis is the world of video-on-demand ( VOD).\n\n\nA couch potato\'s dream and a video rental shop operator\'s nightmare,\nVOD is seen as the killer application that will provide the initial impetus\nfor the interactive TV industry.\n\n\nWith the complete digitalisation of Singapore\'s telephone network,\nVOD and other interactive services will soon become a reality.\n\n\nThe same VOD network can also be used for two-way services such as\ntele-shopping ( like in the case of ordering the pizza), long distance\nlearning, and playing computer games with friends several thousand kilometres\naway.\n\n\nIn Singapore, VOD trials will start in June next year with 150\nhouseholds which will be increased to 500 within 18 months.\n\n\nSingapore Telecom, which is conducting the trial, will initially\noffer services like movies-on-demand, customised news, home shopping and\ninteractive education.\n\n\nBeginning March 1996, it will introduce additional services like\ngames and karaoke-on-demand, Telecom spokesman Mr Ivan Tan said.\n\n\nThe trials will cover a broad cross-section of Singapore households\nand will not be restricted to just a few areas.\n\n\nTelecom expects to award the tender for trial VOD equipment within\nthe next two months, he added.\n\n\nVOD involves the conversion of movies and television shows into\ndigital form so that they can be piped into homes via telephone lines.\n\n\nAt the household, a little " black box" converts these signals into\npictures which are then played over the TV screen.\n\n\nVOD\'s advantage over TV or the cinema is obvious - - subscribers can\nchoose which programmes they would like to watch, when they want to watch it,\nand all from the comforts of home.\n\n\nAll they have to do is use a small remote control to make their\nselections which will be sent via telephone line to a computerised switch.\n\n\nThe switch will in turn direct the information to a computer called a\nvideo server which stores all the programmes.\n\n\nThis server will then deliver the requested programme via telephone\nline to viewers.\n\n\nFor VOD service to take off, the price of a movie must be no more\nthan what it takes to rent a video or see a movie.\n\n\nIn Singapore, that price would be around\n&dollar;5 to\n&dollar;10, said Mr Anil Uberoi, Sun Microsystems Group Marketing Manager for\nNetworking Products.\n\n\n" More than\n&dollar;5 and consumers would think twice before signing up for VOD".\n\n\nApart from price, there are several challenges that VOD operators\nmust overcome before they can implement a system.\n\n\nVOD is a capital intensive project.\n\n\nApart from the " pipes" that carry the movies, games and other stuff,\nthe VOD operator must have the equipment and the software to bill customers.\n\n\nWhat about the " black boxes" - - do customers pay for them?\n\n\nThen there are also technical difficulties such as standards and\nelectronic storage of contents like movies.\n\n\nThese issues are examined in the next pages. \n\n\n\n\n Get ready to ride the movie highway \n\n\nDepite the many problems that persist, there is no doubt that the\ninformation superhighway will eventually have a tremendous impact on the way\nwe live\n\n\nby Kevin Lim\n\n\nBy this time next year, Singapore will have jumped onto the\nvideo-on-demand ( VOD) bandwagon with the start of the nationwide trial by\nSingapore Telecom.\n\n\nSingaporeans from an initial 150 households will be able to call up\nmovies at the touch of a button and watch the movie on their television set.\n\n\nThey will also be able to receive customised news, and have access to\nhome shopping and interactive educational services.\n\n\nOperating on a smaller scale, the Marina Mandarin installed recently\na VOD service offering guests up to 60 video titles a day.\n\n\nThe system will be up and running by the end of the month, the\nhotel\'s spokesman said.\n\n\nIn fact, it seems just a matter of time before cinemas and video\nrental shops go the way of the dinosaur.\n\n\nHowever, behind this seemingly unstoppable march into the 21st\ncentury lurks several customer, technical and business issues that need to be\nresolved.\n\n\nThey include the choice of the TV set as the receiving vehicle for\nVOD, which is being questioned by those who say the PC is preferable, not\nonly for movies but also for all sorts of information delivered over the\ninformation highways.\n\n\nCurrently, the most pressing issues facing VOD operators seem to\nrelate to technology, especially compression and storage.\n\n\nStoring digitised video continues to be a struggle.\n\n\nFor example, a 120-minute movie eats up at least 2 GB of memory.\n\n\nAs such, a modest video server containing only 50 titles requires\nover 100GB of computer storage.\n\n\nPiping this information through the telephone lines to homes and\noffices is another technical challenge.\n\n\nCurrent compression technology can only send 20 frames of a movie per\nsecond on copper.\n\n\nThis gives a picture quality that is similar to what video tapes\noffer.\n\n\nTo achieve TV-type quality requires 30 frames per second.\n\n\nAs such, it does not matter how short the distance between the fibre\noptic trunk and the television set is.\n\n\nAlthough fibre optics are used throughout Singapore, the stretch\nbetween the kerb and the flat or house requires another several hundred\nmetres of copper wire.\n\n\nInstalling fibre optics would be expensive but maybe unnecessary\nbecause of potential future developments in compression technology.\n\n\nScientists are currently trying to reduce the strain of transmitting\nvideo over telephone lines by filtering out redundant information - - for\nexample the mountain in the background - - between one frame and the next, so\nthat the network need only carry the parts of the video that has changed.\n\n\nOther issues which VOD providers and equipment vendors must look into\ninclude compatibility between the different equipment on the market, and\ndeveloping systems that allow signals to be sent over a hotchpotch of\ntelephone lines.\n\n\nThis is because even in the most advance cities like Singapore,\ntelephone lines comprise copper, coaxial and optic fibre cables.\n\n\nAnother issue for VOD operators to ponder is ease of use.\n\n\nMr Charles Christ, the vice-president in charge of Digital Equipment\nCorporation\'s thrust into the interactive TV market, said: " VOD must be\npainless to use, and the response time must be instantaneous".\n\n\nThe same TV viewers today who still do not know how to program a\nvideo cassette recorder are the potential VOD customers.\n\n\nNo VOD system is going to have any headway if it is difficult to\naccess.\n\n\nThe system\'s response time must be like that of a remote control-TV\nconnection.\n\n\nIf VOD does not respond immediately, users will be put off, he said.\n\n\nIn addition, there is the billing system to consider.\n\n\nIt must be automatic, like using the telephone.\n\n\nCurrently, most cable operators charge viewers a fixed monthly\nsubscription rate.\n\n\nBut once viewers only pay what they choose to view, VOD operators\nmust be able to track usage.\n\n\nCable operators who want to provide VOD must learn quickly how to put\nin place such a system.\n\n\nOther issues need to be faced by VOD operators like cost, government\nregulations and the type of movies and other services to deliver using the\ninformation highway.\n\n\nSaid Oracle Systems Singapore\'s marketing manager Mr Gary Winder: " A\ncity-wide VOD service will take some time to take off.\n\n\nThere are huge investments and test-marketing to consider".\n\n\nHongkong Telecom, for example, said it probably needs a critical mass\nof 200,000 subscribers, each spending an average of around HK&dollar;350 ( S&dollar;70), if\nits project is to be successful.\n\n\nHighlighting the problem of getting accurate feedback, Dr William Lo,\nHongkong Telecom\'s director for strategic planning and project director for\nVOD, said: " If you stop a person on the street and ask him what he wants, he\nwill say educational programmes.\n\n\nVery few people will tell you what they actually want to see".\n\n\nFinally, there are deeply ingrained habits that are hard to break.\n\n\nFor example, it is possible that many Singaporeans go out to the\ncinema not just because they want to catch that particular movie.\n\n\nTo them it could just be an excuse to get out of the house to do\nsomething and to mingle with the crowds.\n\n\nAs such, it seems that the light at the end of the tunnel for VOD is\nnot as bright as it might first appear.\n\n\nMany problems persist, but there is no doubt that the information\nsuperhighway will become a reality.\n\n\nAnd it will have a tremendous impact on the way we live.\n\n\nVOD equipment will become as commonplace as TV sets and radio, and\ninteractive TV services will grow into a multi-billion dollar business.\n\n\nThe only question is how soon. \n\n\n\n\n Highway ticket \n\n\nThe information boom will drive growth in the 90s.\n\n\nThere will be new jobs and services and the way we live, work and\nplay will change\n\n\nby Grace Chng\n\n\nThe information superhighway can be used for the following uses: "\nTalking" to people from all over the world via modems and PCs; more than just\nsocial chat, it widens one\'s shouting distance where others respond to\nappeals for assistance.\n\n\nFor work where office workers reach across the other side of the\nworld electronically to look for information on on-line databases.\n\n\nDiscuss projects with customers through video conferencing and stay\nin touch with office through telecomputing; and Shopping where people can buy\nmany things such as clothes, toys, theatre tickets and books in an electronic\nsupermarket.\n\n\nInvesting in stocks and shares as well as personal finance\nmanagement; the computer\'s ability to manipulate complex databases located in\ndifferent parts of the world allows users to track both personal and\ncorporate investments.\n\n\nOne example is Internet, a giant global electronic community of 20\nmillion users linked together by 25,000 interconnecting networks.\n\n\nInternet has already transformed the way people view the world from\ntheir living rooms, laboratories, factories and offices.\n\n\nSingapore hopes the same transformation will take place with its own\neffort, the national information infrastructure, which will see the island\ncriss-crossed by several networks delivering a variety of features and\nfunctions.\n\n\nThe spectrum of applications stretches from video-on-demand to other\nmore significant efforts such as emergency medical services. \n\n\n\n\n Just Cool! \n\n\nYou\'ve just got back from a bad day at work.\n\n\nYou need a cold beer, fast.\n\n\nBut just to complete that confounded day, the missus ( or your\nfoolish self) had to forget to put new beer in the fridge and heaven knows\nyou hate to mix ice in your beer.\n\n\nDiluted beer is for old men who hang out at

but...Client/server systems are\nsuccessful only when implemented as part of a firm\'s re-engineering strategy\n\n\n\nby Kevin Lim\n\n\nMore large companies are replacing their older mainframes and\nminicomputers with client/server systems.\n\n\nThe reasons are many.\n\n\nA network of PCs and workstations - - on which client/server\napplications are built - - costs less than a mainframe of equivalent power.\n\n\nClient/server solutions also involve distributed computing where work\nis shared by the client ( the PC) and the server ( either a high-end PC or\nworkstation).\n\n\nHence a database or even a heavy-duty engineering program can be\nproduced on the PC, with the server acting only as backup or a means of\ndistributing the data.\n\n\nIn contrast, the old mainframe environment requires all\nnumber-crunching to be done at the mainframe level, as dumb terminals can\nonly relay signals to and from the main computer.\n\n\nThis unnecessarily slows the system down.\n\n\nBut switching to client/server systems has not always been positive.\n\n\nInternational Data Corporation ( IDC), a research firm, following a\nsurvey of large users in the US earlier this year, said: " Mainframes clearly\ninvolve higher capital costs.\n\n\nHowever, we believe that it is a mistake to extrapolate that higher\ncapital costs necessarily incur higher operating costs.\n\n\n" Indeed, for certain complex applications, mainframes enjoy distinct\ncost advantages over local area networks ( LANs)."\n\n\nMr Klaus Wenger, Andersen Consulting\'s regional coordinator for its\nAsean/Greater China Technology Integration Services organisation added: "\nThere are probably hundreds of client/server type systems that have failed to\ndeliver.\n\n\nThese failures have however never been highlighted.\n\n\nAccording to IDC, staffing costs account for a large portion of total\nrunning costs of complex networks.\n\n\nAnd even if companies are prepared to pay for staff, they may not get\nenough of IT professionals who are familiar with client/server systems, said\nMr Lionel Lim, Asean managing director of Sun Microsystems.\n\n\nAdded Mr Wenger: " Even though LAN flexibility improves personal\nproductivity, it can dramatically increase complexity, and therefore systems\nmanagement costs as workloads increase in sophistication." dditionally, some\nissues still plague client/server systems.\n\n\nSecurity and maintenance of remote servers containing critical\ninformation are two such key issues.\n\n\nSo why switch to client/server?\n\n\nMr K C Lee, the National Computer Board\'s assistant chief executive,\nGovernment Systems Division, said that " by comparing cost alone, you are not\ncomparing apples with apples.\n\n\nYou can do more on a PC than on a dumb server".\n\n\nWith the emphasis on service, front-end counter staff will need more\nprocessing power in order to respond quickly to customer enquiries.\n\n\nAnd while he concedes that mainframes still possess several\nadvantages, the government expects to spend more on client/servers over the\nnext few years while mainframe related expenses will remain the same\nproportion of the total budget, he said.\n\n\nThe increasing emphasis on multimedia which takes up more digital\nspace on networks, will also give mainframe systems more problems.\n\n\nElectronic Data Systems, the systems integrator for the recent USA \'\n94 World Cup, said concern about delivering multi-media type information was\none of the main reasons that prompted the World Cup organisers to choose a\nclient/server system.\n\n\nThis system, built on Sun Microsystems workstations, provided on-line\nand on-time information to journalists and officials involved in the World\nCup in nine US venues and Zurich, Switzerland where FIFA ( the world soccer\nbody) is based.\n\n\nMr Cheche Vidal Noya, vice-president in charge of technology for the\nWorld Cup USA 94, said: " We identified a client/server model right from the\nstart because we knew it can overcome the geographic, logistical applications\nand information challenges presented by this event.\n\n\n" And we were proven right.\n\n\nAll our applications were developed very quickly and easily.\n\n\nMore importantly, we were able to implement these applications\nrapidly in a very large network".\n\n\nUsers must realise that to fully benefit from client/server systems,\nthey must incorporate it into the whole process of change, which covers not\njust computers but the entire business processes in their companies.\n\n\n Handy Computing with the PDA Smaller and lighter than a filofax\nor mobile phone, the personal digital assistant ( PDA) is finally gaining\nrecognition \n\n\nby Cheng Chee Seng\n\n\nThe application that is giving hope to personal digital assistant (\nPDA) makers is wireless communications.\n\n\nPDAs like the Apple Newton MessagePad allow users to send and receive\ndata wirelessly.\n\n\nThe Newton has an infrared capability that allows users to beam data\nacross to another Newton.\n\n\nWith many applications now available, the PDA is not only a roving\nelectronic secretary but also a stocks adviser and the gateway to the\nelectronic highways of information banks and communications worldwide.\n\n\nAlthough they are commonly known as palmtop computers here, PDAs are\nnot computers in the true sense of the word.\n\n\nYou cannot run your favourite software applications such as Windows,\nWordPerfect, or QuarkX-press on them.\n\n\nNeither is it practical to prepare your company\'s\n&dollar;60 million budget and write a 100,000 word novel on them.\n\n\nThey are small - - half the size of a shorthand pad weighing under\n350 gm.\n\n\nMost have either a QWERTY keyboard ( like the HP100LX) or pen-based\ndesign ( like the Newton MessagePad 110).\n\n\nThe Sharp Wizard on the other hand is a hybrid with a keyboard as\nwell as an on-screen sketch-pad.\n\n\nApple\'s Newton blazed the trail for PDAs.\n\n\nBut the reception when they were launched 12 to 18 months ago was\ncold because the PDA did not live up to its expectations of being an\nelectronic filofax.\n\n\nOne possibility is that there were insufficient applications to run\non the Newton.\n\n\nThe crucial faxing, paging, connection software and other important\nutilities did not appear in time.\n\n\nAs a result, the Newton was seen as just a pen-based electronic\norganiser that recognises handwriting.\n\n\nA more plausible explanation is that consumers were perhaps looking\nfor desktop computing power in a palmtop or PDA.\n\n\nNew developments in the region\'s data communication technologies and\ninfrastructure have changed this.\n\n\nAlso, consumers are now more aware of the true role of PDAs as a\npocketable mobile personal information device that also provides two-way\ninformation exchange.\n\n\nIt is interesting that where Apple flounders, palmtop computer\npioneer Hewlett-Packard ( HP) has been quietly moving towards its goal of\nbeing the " most connectable" PDA.\n\n\nThe second generation and higher-powered HP100LX offers users\nreal-time stocks prices and news-flashes round-the-clock.\n\n\nThis new service has been put together by HP together with Singapore\nTelecom and Motorola which developed the modem for this service.\n\n\nBut it is with the introduction of Singapore Telecom\'s new public\nmobile data service, DataRoam, in late July that two-way wireless\ntransmission became a reality.\n\n\nBy plugging the Motorola InfoTac data communicator into the HP100LX,\na user will gain instant access into the new world of wireless two-way\ncommunications. \n\n\nIn other words, you may be working on a ship anchored at the\nEastern Anchorage in Singapore port but you can still check your electronic\nmessages in your office PC or monitor your stock portfolio.\n\n\nYou can even confer with service engineers back home in your\nheadquarters in the United States.\n\n\nDigital Equipment Singapore\'s field service engineers are using a\nDataRoam service to keep in touch with customers.\n\n\nEngineers at the customer site can access Digital\'s database\nlocated in the United States for information and recommend solutions almost\nimmediately.\n\n\nPostmen from Singapore Post\'s Local Urgent Mail Service are\ndirected to their destinations through the DataRoam service, resulting in\nfaster service.\n\n\nWith seven out of the 21 wireless networks in the world located in\nAsia where many areas still lack good communications infrastructure, PDAs\ncould well become very popular.\n\n\nMr Tan Kiok Siang, Marketing Manager for Hewlett Packard\'s mobile\nproducts estimated that sales for the palmtops in the last ten months jumped\n70 percent.\n\n\n" I am confident that the upward trend will continue especially\nwith the tremendous opportunities offered by wireless comunication".\n\n\nA hope that will no doubt be shared by key players like Apple,\nAmstrad, Tandy, Casio and Compaq.\n\n\nPDA\'s success rests on software developers.\n\n\nThey have to develop more applications especially in the credit\ncard sized PCMCIA format.\n\n\nAlready some PCMCIA-based applications are available like\nTravelling Software\'s Newton Connection for Windows, Ex Machina\'s PocketCall\n( a terminal emulation software) and Microsoft\'s " Microsoft At Work"\noperating system for hand-held device adopted by Compaq for their yet\nunnamed PDA.\n\n\nWith the exception of a couple of companies here like Reuters\nSingapore and Associated Breweries, companies are still unconvinced about the\nbenefits of palmtop devices.\n\n\nBut the good news is there are more companies assessing PDAs for\ntheir use.\n\n\nFor example, courier companies are looking into their use.\n\n\nThere is also talk of developing wireless two-way communication to\nexecute the buy-sell instructions for share trading.\n\n\nThe attraction is instant confirmation of transaction and price.\n\n\nOn the drawing board are software development efforts to tap the\npower of DataRoam for wireless faxing, 2-way messaging, wireless

{'text': 'New tools drive client/server boom \n\n\nUsers are turning to software tools to develop client/server\napplications which is seeing rapid growth from now until 1996\n\n\nby Abdul Rahman b Mohd Said\n\n\nForrester Research estimates sales of client/server software and\nrelated services to hit US&dollar;4.7 billion ( S&dollar;7.1 billion) this year, up from\nUS&dollar;2.5 billion in 1992.\n\n\nBy 1996, client/server software and services will account for 20\npercent of a US&dollar;100 billion international software industry.\n\n\nThe Gartner Group predicted that new multi-user online applications\nusing a client/server architecture will account for 75 percent and 90 percent\ntotal applications developed by 1996 and 2000 respectively.\n\n\nBut it also warns that only 5 percent of current is development staff\nhave the skills to develop cooperative type applications.\n\n\nThis will create a serious anomaly: whereas demand for client/server\napplications will boom in the next few years, the capability to develop such\napplications will be severely limited.\n\n\nUsing off-the-shelf client/server packages may help lighten this\nproblem, but packages generally do not meet the user requirements.\n\n\nCustom mission critical applications are often needed by\norganisations to gain a competitive edge.\n\n\nExpertise is needed as client/server applications become complex.\n\n\nThey tend to be split, with different parts of the program resting in\ndifferent computers and each performing a differing part of the processing.\n\n\nYet they all have to work together as one.\n\n\nSome of the common client/server development tools tend to provide\nusers with an easy to use interface to extract data from the server.\n\n\nBut client/server development must be seen as an enterprise-wide\neffort.\n\n\nDevelopment must be coordinated between departments to prevent any\nintegration problems.\n\n\nThe solution to enterprise-wide client/server development can be\nfound in the tools now being used to develop mainframe type solutions.\n\n\nIntegrated CASE ( Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools such as\nTexas Instruments\' Information Engineering Facility ( IEF) and Oracle\'s\nCooperative Development Environment ( CDE) are designed to automate the\nentire software development life-cycle.\n\n\nBoth have grown from the mainframe computing model, and now support\nthe split processing required in client/server environments.\n\n\nAlthough integrated CASE has faced some resistance because of the\ndiscipline and methodology it imposes upon software developers, this is\nprecisely what is needed for an enterprise-wide development effort.\n\n\n" Client/server developments in an organisation can easily become\nuncoordinated, unless developers enforce strict rules on the definitions and\nrelationships between different data groups," says Mr Teng Cheng Chong,\nGeneral Manager ( Asia) for TI\'s Advanced Information Management ( AIM)\nDivision.\n\n\nThe heart of the integrated case approach lies in the concept of the\nshared repository around which different processes of the development life\ncycle - - software planning, analysis, design and code generation - -\nrevolve.\n\n\nThe repository also helps increase developer productivity by allowing\ncommon program components and objects to be shared and reused.\n\n\nDeveloping client/server applications requires the program to be\nsplit and run across different hardware platforms.\n\n\nBy breaking up the application into its data, logic and presentation\ncomponents, it can be deployed at both the client ( workstation) and servers\nto be processed separately but cooperatively.\n\n\nThe various components can then communicate with one another\ntransparently across different hardware platforms.\n\n\nBest of all, these tools support a wide range of client, server, and\ncommunications systems so that users can mix and match their hardware.\n\n\nThey need not learn the specifics of each database or communication\nprotocol as the Case tools will integrate these for them. \n\n\n\n\n New modes of working \n\n\nSharing processing tasks in client/server models have resulted in\nusers finding new ways of working more productively\n\n\nby Abdul Rahman b Mohd Said\n\n\nClient/server computing is not the be-all and end-all of computing.\n\n\nEven as the desktop and server computers begin to work cooperatively,\nsharing the processing tasks, this new mode is spawning other new forms of\ngetting information across the organisation.\n\n\nMuch of the " split personality" of a client/server system comes from\na set of functions contained in popular relational databases such as Oracle,\nSybase and Informix.\n\n\nFeatures such as remote procedure calls and triggers enable a user\nusing his terminal to issue a command to the database which then\nindependently executes the procedures and sends back the results to the user.\n\n\nMany organisations maintain separate databases, either on a\ndepartmental or regional level.\n\n\nBut distributed processing cannot support split processing on\nmultiple servers at the same time without complex programming.\n\n\nAll this changed in 1992, when Oracle launched what it called the\nfirst cooperative-server database in its Oracle7 product.\n\n\nA cooperative-server database hides the complexity of a computer\nnetwork by allowing applications to access data located on multiple computers\njust as if all the data were stored on a single computer.\n\n\nIn this way, a cooperative-server database simplifies application\nbuilding and improves decisions by making access to information easier.\n\n\nMany experts agree that the distributed database model is the\nultimate form of client/server computing.\n\n\nUsers can extract the latest information from across the\norganisation, integrate it and make more meaningful analyses.\n\n\nAnother rapidly emerging trend is to embed a new technology called\nworkflow automation into a client/server application.\n\n\nWorkflow simply means getting the computer to pass information from\none person in a work chain to another.\n\n\nFor example, approvals for loan applications which involve a chain of\npeople checking on information, risks and other issues.\n\n\nIt takes as long as two weeks to complete the process manually\nwhereas on the computer - - with embedded workflow - it takes only two to\nthree hours to process the application.\n\n\nAccording to a leading US research and analysis company, The Meta\nGroup, embedded workflow will be the norm in client/server offerings in the\nnext two years.\n\n\nLeading the pack are companies like Computron and Dun & Bradstreet\nSoftware.\n\n\nOne key element of workflow automation is the intelligent agent or\nsoftware robot which can filter and route information.\n\n\nFor example, you can program the agent to read your electronic mail\nand automatically reroute the messages to wherever you are.\n\n\nYou can also instruct the agent to arrange your messages according to\na set of priorities that you define.\n\n\nAny user of electronic mail will appreciate this, as it saves a lot\nof time wading through the messages. \n\n\n\n\n Less fuss at NUS \n\n\nSubject registration at NUS is now easier because of a\nclient/server-based registration system\n\n\nBy Kevin Lim\n\n\nFirst year students at five National University of Singapore\nfaculties chose their subjects via computer when they were admitted this\nyear, thanks to a software developed by the NUS Computer Centre.\n\n\nBased on a client/server model, the new subject registration provides\nstudents with a " one-stop shopping destination" and reduces time spent on\nqueuing and applying separately for each subject.\n\n\nThe new system was introduced to tie in with the modular system\nadopted by the Arts and Social Sciences, Business Administration, Building\nand Estate Management, Engineering, and Science Faculties.\n\n\nOver 4000 students were affected.\n\n\nA trial involving Business Admin students was carried out a year\nearlier.\n\n\nMrs Wong Ai Luen, deputy-director of NUS\' Computer Centre and Head of\nits Planning Services Unit, said the Centre chose client-server, primarily\nbecause it had to design an easy-to-use graphical user interface for\nregistration.\n\n\nThis was necessary as earlier surveys had indicated that about half\nthe incoming students were computer-literate.\n\n\n" NUS wants to take advantage of the full power of the PC and\nWindows.\n\n\nWe wanted to use colourful screens which host-based mainframe\nsystems have difficulty providing," she said.\n\n\nThe Computer Centre developed its subject registration system using\nOracle\'s relational database and development tools and an IBM RS/6000 Unix\nserver.\n\n\nThe project stretched over several months and also involved the\nRegistrar\'s Office, Centre for Education Technology, Estate Office, and the\nNUS Student\'s Union.\n\n\nThe registration for the Science and Arts faculties took place at the\ngym where 40 of NUS\' mostly Digital PCs were transported to, while students\nin the other faculties registered for subjects at their respective faculties\'\ncomputer rooms.\n\n\nNUS made separate arrangements for Arts and Science because they were\nthe biggest faculties with intakes of about l,500 students each.\n\n\nThe introduction of the modular system - which allows students to\nchoose which courses they want to take during each semester, as well as\nduring a special term if they wish to graduate earlier made registration more\ndifficult.\n\n\nCiting the Arts Faculty as an example, Mrs Wong said the manual\nprocess was tedious since the faculty\'s 12 departments offered a wide choice\nof subjects.\n\n\nIn addition, there are four special programmes like European Studies\nand Mass Communications which students can opt for.\n\n\nFirst-year Arts students must select three subjects comprising two\nunits each.\n\n\nIn most cases, they had to do one of the two units in the first\nsemester and the second in the second semester.\n\n\nBut now that computers are being used for the first time, Arts can\nkey in their choices within 10 minutes instead of applying for each unit one\nat a time over a one to two week period.\n\n\nFor Science students, the system works even better since they will\nknow straight away whether or not they have been allocated the subject, since\nthe faculty\'s policy is to let students study what they want as long as they\nmeet the prerequisites.\n\n\nThere is also an additional facility in the registration process for\nScience students in that the PC will display only those major subjects which\nthe student can apply for, based on his " A" level results.\n\n\nThe Computer Centre developed different registration procedures for\ndifferent students using the same client/server system, owing to the diverse\nneeds of the five faculties.\n\n\nDescribing how the system works, Mrs Wong said that a student will\nhave to key in his matriculation number and smart card pin number to enter\nthe system.\n\n\nThe system then displays his name and the course he is pursuing.\n\n\nFrom here, the student selects his choice of major subjects and the\nunits he wants to pursue.\n\n\nThe system will prompt the student when he keys in too many or too\nfew options or when he is expected to sign up for a compulsory unit.\n\n\nMrs Wong said NUS will extend its computerised subject registration\nsystem to include undergraduates in their second, third and fourth years when\nthe next academic year begins in July next year, as this is in line with NUS\'\ncomputerisation plans and Singapore\'s IT2000 goals. \n\n\n\n\nThe Straits Times Saturday June 26 1999\n\n\n Hybrid Cars: What a Gas \n\n\nby Leow Ju-Len\n\n\nIt is no joke.\n\n\nThe future of motoring is in alternative fuel technologies.\n\n\nThis week, we take a peek at what drives Toyota\'s Prius and other\ngreen cars.\n\n\nTomorrow\'s car is here - today.\n\n\nThe Toyota Prius is the world\'s first petrol-electric hybrid car to\nbe rolled out for sale.\n\n\nIt runs on two power systems - a 1.5-litre petrol engine or an\nelectric motor, or both at once.\n\n\nThe result: It can double the distance you could get out of a full\ntank of petrol with a comparable car.\n\n\nWith an outstanding fuel economy rating of 28 km per litre and a\n50-litre petrol capacity, the Prius can travel an amazing 1,400 km between\nfill-ups.\n\n\nWith that sort of efficiency, the average Singaporean driver, who\ncovers 20,000 km annually, would in theory need to fill up the tank just 14\ntimes a year.\n\n\nBut it has more tricks up its sleeve.\n\n\nIt also emits only half the carbon-dioxide emissions of a comparable\ncar and its toxic emissions are just 10 per cent of Japan\'s legal limits.\n\n\nPlus, it seats five comfortably and has a proper boot that will\nswallow luggage or golf bags easily.\n\n\nIn fact, its tall design means that although it is the same size as a\nCorona on the outside, its interior volume matches that of the larger Camry.\n\n\nWhat makes its efficiency possible is the Toyota Hybrid System (\nTHS).\n\n\nThis complex arrangement of several key components work in concert\nto drive the car in various modes ( see graphic) to cut fuel consumption.\n\n\nThe heart of the system is the Prius\' engine, a low-revving,\nlow-friction 1.5-litre petrol four cylinder.\n\n\nIt develops just 58 bhp, but is tuned for optimum fuel efficiency\nrather than power.\n\n\nOther key components include a 41-bhp electric motor, which\nsupplements the engine; a sealed nickel-metal hydride battery; an on-board\ngenerator that tops up the batteries; a water-cooled AC/DC inverter; and an\ningenious power-split device which takes the place of a conventional\ntransmission. \n\n\nThe latter is able to vary the amount of engine power used to drive\nthe car or charge the batteries, or it can combine the driving force from\nboth the engine and motor when extra performance is required.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '6cea4d17-0340-43a2-a705-ddac9c3b8b09', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.786420+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9566320776939392, 'non_english_score': 0.04336792230606079}

ENCYCLOPEDIA Published by Compton\'s New Media\n\n\nENCARTA MULTIMEDIA ENCYCLOPEDIA\n\n\nPublished by Microsoft Home Series\n\n\nThese are the three top selling encyclopedia CD ROMs.\n\n\nYou can hardly go wrong choosing any one of them if all you want is an\nencyclopedia on a disk for dipping into occasionally.\n\n\nBut if you are particular or have specific needs, you may find one\nmore satisfying than the other.\n\n\nThere are many common features.\n\n\nAll have compiled an amazing number of articles from documented\nsources and impressive bibliography.\n\n\nAll need 4MB RAM to run well, although Encarta\'s Mac version prefers\n5 to 8 MB.\n\n\nTopics covered tend to fall into similar categories such as history,\ngeography, the arts and science.\n\n\nAll three have a timeline in which key events are laid out from year\ndot to the present.\n\n\nDifferences are largely in depth and source of information, as well\nas interface.\n\n\nHow significant these differences are depends on your needs and\npreferences.\n\n\nMultimedia features\n\n\nThese are what impresses in CD ROMs.\n\n\nGrolier has 53 video clips in seven categories, including 16 great\nhistorical events such as Charles Lindbergh\'s transatlantic flight.\n\n\nCompton\'s 33 video, 12 animated clips and 54 slide shows are\nimpressive though the explanations are more suited to students.\n\n\nEncarta\'s paltry 12 video is balanced by 89 animated videos which\nrange from an impressive explanation of the Doppler Effect to how a cat lands\non four feet.\n\n\nOverall, Encarta has the most number of pictures, sound bites, video\nclips and narrated animations and maps.\n\n\nSearch facilities\n\n\nGrolier\'s search template has four fields to include or exclude words\nor phrases, and can also be programmed to meet specific needs.\n\n\nArticles are linked for quick cross reference.\n\n\nUsing the Knowledge Tree, you can search by six main topics, opening\nup categories and subcategories and tabulated information.\n\n\nCompton\'s Info Pilot links an article automatically to four related\narticles which are useful if they are what you want but may be irrelevant.\n\n\nIts Topic Tree, however, works better than Grolier\'s Knowledge Tree.\n\n\nCompton\'s Expert Mode is also brilliant in giving the user limitless\nwork space which can be saved and returned to at the next session.\n\n\nEncarta\'s equivalent is its Find Wizard which opens up into an\nelaborate template from which to choose from nine topics.\n\n\nYou can narrow your search by keying the dates, place and other\nparameters.\n\n\nBy the way, you can\'t beat Encarta for its picture quality.\n\n\nEase of learning and use\n\n\nThis is important because nothing puts one off more than software\nthat takes ages to learn.\n\n\nThe most intuitive of the three is Compton\'s, which makes it best\nsuited to children and younger students.\n\n\nGrolier is most user-friendly with a well-planned tool pallet.\n\n\nIt comes with a well-planned, no-nonsense user\'s guide which contains\nnotes to a guided tour, and tips on research.\n\n\nEncarta has the most elaborate and attractive user\'s guide with\ncartoon drawings to make the learning process simple and painless, if a\nlittle childish.\n\n\nHelp for the researcher is in a separate booklet that is a little\nmore serious and an excellent tool for new researchers.\n\n\nIt even has a chapter on how to write a research paper.\n\n\nOn balance\n\n\nChoose Grolier for its comprehensive and in-depth information from\nhighly-regarded sources.\n\n\nEncarta is a CD ROM lover\'s delight, which the information does not\nmatch.\n\n\nCompton\'s sits between the other two in terms of multimedia features\nand information.\n\n\nThe bottom line: Grolier for serious encyclopedia user; Encarta for\nthe CD ROM enthusiast; Compton\'s for a relative new-comer to both.\n\n\nCD titles for PCs were evaluated on NEC\'s Power-mate 425i PC, NEC\'s\nMultisync monitor and NEC\'s triple speed CD drive.\n\n\nAlso used was Creative Technology\'s Sound Blaster 16 SCSI-2.\n\n\n Sound advice on CD ROMs \n\n\nBy Lulin Reutens and M K Wong\n\n\nSound is only one of the three components of a CD ROM.\n\n\nAlthough sometimes not absolutely essential, good sound can add much\npleasure to the enjoyment of CD ROMs.\n\n\nHowever, many new users have encountered problems in trying to get\nthe sound working.\n\n\nWHAT SOUND?\n\n\nTo understand the situation, it is important to know that there are\nthree sources of sound from a PC with a CD ROM drive.\n\n\nIf only some sound or no sound at all is heard, it usually means that\none of the three sources is not connected, or initialised.\n\n\nDigitised & synthesized sounds\n\n\nA CD ROM which contains, say, an encyclopaedia, is likely to have two\ntypes of sounds:\n\n\n· Digitized sound, which is a close representation of the original\nsound, is usually used for narration, ie voice.\n\n\nSynthesized ( or midi, which stands for musical instrument digital\ninterface) sound is usually used for music.\n\n\nIt is actually a mathematical formula which gives only an\napproximation of the sound of a particular musical instrument.\n\n\nThe quality of the music produced is nothing like digital sound.\n\n\nThe reason midi sound is used in CD ROMs is that it takes up less\ndisk space - as little as one per cent.\n\n\nMidi sound is used mostly in games and encyclopaedia CD ROMs.\n\n\nIf your system is not set up properly, you may not hear the midi\nsound.\n\n\nSo music or perhaps background sounds may not be heard.\n\n\nIf some sounds can\'t be heard, you can re-run the set-up program for\nthe sound card and run the diagnostic program to make sure both types of\nsounds are audible.\n\n\nBoth types of sound from a CD ROM disk is heard through the speakers\nconnected to the soundcard\'s output jack.\n\n\nAudio-format sound\n\n\nThe third type of sound is the music which comes from playing an\naudio CD in a CD ROM drive.\n\n\nThe data ( ie sound) is output via the headphone jack in the front\npanel of the drive.\n\n\nMusical CD ROMs\n\n\nSome CD ROM disks, such as those from Microsoft Home\'s series,\ncontain a combination of all three types of sound.\n\n\nThe extra track of audio-format sound is usually used for\nhigh-quality recordings of classical music.\n\n\nThis technology has enabled CD ROM users to enjoy music of a quality\nas good as that from audio CD players.\n\n\nSuch CD ROM disks can also be played with a normal CD player for the\nmusic portions.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE 2 PAIRS OF SPEAKERS?\n\n\nIn the set-up described above, you need two pairs of speakers - one\nfor the sound card, the other for the headphone jack.\n\n\nBut this means extra expense.\n\n\nIt is possible to connect the components so you need only one pair.\n\n\nThis is how it is done: Of the three jacks in the soundcard, one is\nthe line out for the speakers.\n\n\nAnother is for the microphone.\n\n\nThe third is a line in.\n\n\nUsing a cable with RCA jacks at both ends, connect the headphone jack\nof the drive to the line in of the sound card.\n\n\nThis can be done only if your CD ROM drive is external.\n\n\nFor internal drives, the connection is made internally.\n\n\nHowever, if sound quality is important to you, be warned that such a\nconnection will affect the quality of the sound, especially the music.\n\n\nPC CHAT With Cheng Chee Seng\n\n\n TRUE COLOURS \n\n\nThe war among colour inkjet printers is fierce and fiery.\n\n\nCanon fired the first salvo by handing out folders with print samples\nof its Canon JC-600 alongside with Hewlett-Packard\'s Deskjet 550C showing the\nlatter the worse in comparison.\n\n\nLast month Epson joined the fray when it too handed out folders\ncomparing print samples of its brand new Epson colour Stylus with the Canon\nand HP printers.\n\n\nObviously Epson\'s printout of the " fruit basket" scanned-image came\nout best with the HP560C coming out better than the Canon BJC600.\n\n\nTwo weeks later, HP could stand it no longer and issued out " several\nhundred" colour print sample folders to their dealers.\n\n\nThere is obviously a lesson to learn here.\n\n\nIt is clear that there is a way of making print samples of one\nprinter look better - or worse - than another.\n\n\nBut how?\n\n\nHere are some suggestions from several industry-insiders:\n\n\n· Printers are usually optimised for use with certain types of paper.\n\n\nUsing the right paper produces better results.\n\n\nEven the right paper will produce poor results if it has\ndeteriorated because of dampness.\n\n\nAltering the " Bleed Control" settings or overriding the automatic\nmode will affect the printout adversely.\n\n\nSome printers work better with scanned images while others print\nbetter patterns.\n\n\nAn outdated printer driver will also affect the printout.\n\n\nSo how can consumers find out more accurately what a colour inkjet\nprinter can really do?\n\n\nThe experts have some advice too.\n\n\nInsist on an on-the-spot printing test on plain photocopying paper.\n\n\nUse the same graphics and drivers to test your next preferred\nprinter.\n\n\nTests should be made on the type of work you normally do.\n\n\nOf course some dealers may not let you do all that, but at least now\nyou know!\n\n\nAnd you may be lucky enough to find a friendly dealer.\n\n\nBIG DEAL.\n\n\nThe " Biggest NoteBook Computer Sale" held at the Funan Centre\nrecently didn\'t quite live up to its name.\n\n\nThere were just 10 booths consisting of mostly newcomers to Funan\nCentre and to the notebook scene, with the exception of Addon Systems, Votrex\nand South Asia.\n\n\nOn the first morning of the show, an amused notebook dealer on the\nfifth floor observed: " Look at those poor guys trying to do a demonstration!\n\n\nAnybody who knows just a bit about notebooks will know that the\nbright sunlight from the skylight will make the LCD screens unreadable, let\nalone impress would-be customers".\n\n\nStill, good try, Pidemco.\n\n\nSIM LIM SCENE\n\n\nThings are moving again at Singapore\'s second oldest computer-mart.\n\n\nIt seems that quite a few computer dealers have moved out following\na rather substantial rental hike.\n\n\nSome moved to Funan Centre and others elsewhere.\n\n\nMost complained bitterly about how hard it was to live with high\noverheads.\n\n\nOne computer vendor obviously thinks otherwise.\n\n\nGravis has just taken out a big shop on the fourth floor lining it\nwall-to-wall with one of the biggest collections of computer systems,\nperipherals and accessories, second only to the Challenger Superstore in\nFunan.\n\n\nut there is a major difference and one that matters too!\n\n\nThe prices at Sim Lim Square are much lower!\n\n\n Getting the best out of client/server Don\'t just introduce\nclient/server technology for the sake of it.\n\n\nUse it to solve business problems \n\n\nBy PETER GOH\n\n\nClient/server technology is not necessarily a faster, cheaper or\neasier alternative to mainframe computing.\n\n\nIt is also not the answer to every business problem.\n\n\nHence, to be able to get the best out of client/server technology,\nit is crucial to apply it to the right situation.\n\n\nOrganisations which have successfully implemented client/server\ntechnology did so to solve business problems rather than merely introduce a\nnew technology.\n\n\nClient/server computing is justifiable if it is done as part of\nbusiness process re-design which involves re-thinking existing applications\nto remove non-value-added activities.\n\n\nClient/server technology can be a key technology for implementing\nbusiness changes.\n\n\nONE CASE STUDY\n\n\nThe experience of a social security department of a European country\nbore this out.\n\n\nInstead of simply implementing new information technologies, the\ndepartment wanted to have new ways of delivering benefits, including social\nsecurity, unemployment and child support to more than 20 million people.\n\n\nIt then decided on a revamp of the way its 80,000 civil servants in\n1,800 locations did their jobs.\n\n\nThe department wanted to develop a holistic approach to delivering\nbenefits, integrating on one terminal a complete picture of each person\'s\nsituation, including all benefits and payments.\n\n\nA good job was done of preparing the environment for the\nintroduction of the new technology.\n\n\nThese included preparing workers accustomed to manual operations for\nthe upcoming changes.\n\n\nThe department realised that users must adapt to work with the\nsystem and that means extensive change management. \n\n\nIS professionals must change their way of thinking and behaving,\nparticularly if the brunt of their experience has been with a mainframe.\n\n\nThe system, installed in 1989, dispatches 74,000 payments a day.\n\n\nThe majority of benefits are distributed through 20,000 post\noffices in the form of booklets with six month\'s worth of cheques that\nrecipients cash each week.\n\n\nThe new retirement pension system handles 99.5 percent of all cases\nautomatically and is saving this government an estimated S&dollar;2.5 billion a\nyear, with an increase in efficiency of more than 20 percent.\n\n\nAlso, error rates on assessments dropped from 10 percent to 2\npercent.\n\n\nTHE RISKS Many of the benefits associated with client/server arise\nout of new types of applications.\n\n\nLikewise, many of the risks and costs of client/server arise from\nthese same sources.\n\n\nThere are several reasons why client/server systems are riskier to\ndevelop.\n\n\nFor one, the development and maintenance of client/server systems\nare more complex.\n\n\nOne reason is because client/server applications incorporate GUIs (\nGraphical User Interface).\n\n\nThey are very interactive and potentially require more complex\nlogic than traditional mainframe-style interfaces.\n\n\nTherefore, the economic benefits of implementing client/server\ntechnology need to be carefully analysed.\n\n\nIt would be foolish indeed to scrap millions of dollars that have\nbeen invested in existing host-based applications without a clear\nunderstanding of the economic benefits.\n\n\n SOLVING BUSINESS PROBLEMS \n\n\nClearly, client/server is not the antidote for all of today\'s\nbusiness problems.\n\n\nWhen applied correctly and for the right reasons, client/server can\nhelp companies address competitive pressures and meet customer needs.\n\n\nBut to deliver potential client/server models must add value to the\norganisation.\n\n\nThe key objective is to create as much value as possible from the\ntechnology investment without getting swept away by the technology.\n\n\nTo create value, client/server can help computers become greater\nassets by making their roles more active; computers can become more active\nparticipants in the decision making process, rather than act as passive word\nprocessors or number crunchers.\n\n\nClient/server also brings power to the desk-top - power to make\nstrategic decisions and strengthen the capability of the workforce.\n\n\nThe key is to look for value that more than pays for the\ntechnology.\n\n\nThe return on investment should be sound before proceeding with\nclient/server.\n\n\nClient/server is not the solution to every business problem, but in\nthe right situation, with a sound investment and a process that is designed\ncorrectly, client/server can help organisations operate and compete more\nstrategically.\n\n\nPeter Goh is a manager with Andersen

Dhanabalan\n\n\n02-04-93  Structure of economy stabilised; hollowing-out unlikely\nin S\'pore \n\n\nBy Chan Hwa Loon\n\n\nTHE structure of the Singapore economy has stabilised and the relative\nsizes of the major sectors should not change drastically from their present\nlevels.\n\n\nThis was the assessment of Trade and Industry Minister S Dhanabalan,\nwho said in an interview on Tuesday that the kind of " hollowing out" of\nindustries seen in Hongkong was not likely to take place here.\n\n\nIn the long term, the share of manufacturing in the economy should be\nbetween Switzerland\'s 25% and Japan\'s 28%.\n\n\nManufacturing makes up about 27 per cent of Singapore\'s Gross Domestic\nProduct today, compared to about 10 % in the 1960s.\n\n\nOn suggestions of hollowing out Mr Dhanabalan said that so far\napplications for industrial land and Jurong Town Corporation ( JTC)\nfactories, as well as the number of retrenchments did not indicate that it\nwas happening.\n\n\nHe added that the drop in JTC factory tenants was due mainly to large\ntenants moving out into their own premises, rather than companies pulling out\nof Singapore.\n\n\nLast week, JTC released the occupancy rate for its flatted factories,\nwhich showed a fall to 94 % last year from 99 % in 1991.\n\n\nIn his view, the commerce sector may decline in relative terms, with\nthe financial and business services sector picking up the slack.\n\n\nHowever the Government is not targeting any sector for growth at the\nexpense of others.\n\n\nNor is it forcing Singaporeans to venture abroad.\n\n\nWhat the Government is trying to do is to draw attention to the\nopportunities overseas and remove impediments to venturing abroad.\n\n\nOn the ideal size of Singapore\'s external economy, he said the\nGovernment has not set any targets.\n\n\nBut as Singapore\'s stock of private foreign direct investments was\nonly 12 % of Gross National Product, compared to Switzerland\'s 30 %, " there\nis room for us to improve".\n\n\nWhile economic upgrading and regionalisation were complementary, he\nwas concerned that the structural changes should not happen so fast that\npeople could not cope with them.\n\n\nGovernment incentives should at best be neutral and not make overseas\ninvestment more attractive than local investment, as higher wages were\nalready putting steady pressure on companies to upgrade.\n\n\nLocal businessmen have not been slow in venturing into Vietnam\nSINGAPORE businessmen have not been slow in venturing into Vietnam although\nfigures show that others appear to have stolen a march on them, said Trade\nand Industry Minister S.\n\n\nDhanabalan.\n\n\nIn an interview with The Straits Times, Mr Dhanabalan said many small\nSingapore investors in Vietnam are not captured in the statistics.\n\n\n" These people like to do things quietly.\n\n\nAnd as somebody said, these people have found the honey pot and why\nshould they go round broadcasting it to everybody else.\n\n\nThe fact that we don\'t have complete figures doesn\'t worry me," he\nsaid.\n\n\nAccording to Vietnamese data, Singaporeans have invested in 24\nprojects there last year worth about US&dollar;110 million ( S&dollar;176 million).\n\n\nInvestments worth another US&dollar;500 million are awaiting approval.\n\n\nAlthough Singapore is the 11th largest foreign investor in Vietnam,\nit is still ahead of neighbouring countries including Thailand, which had\nsaid it wanted to see Indo-china as its market.\n\n\nSome big Singapore companies like Straits Steamship, Keppel,\nAsia-Pacific Breweries have already gained a foothold there.\n\n\n" People are already going there.\n\n\nIt doesn\'t have to be centrally controlled, directed and restricted.\n\n\nThat is not the way our economy develops," he said.\n\n\nOn the trade front, Singapore is Vietnam\'s largest trading partner.\n\n\nTotal two-way trade amounted to about S&dollar;l.7 billion last year.\n\n\nMr Dhanabalan said that although Vietnam was not as big as China, it\nwould become an important market for Singapore investors and traders. \n\n\n\n\n Private firms, \'not stat boards, must lead overseas investments\'\n\n\n\nBy Chan Hwa Loon\n\n\nThe function of spearheading overseas investment should not be\nfoisted on statutory boards, said Trade and Industry Minister S.\n\n\nDhanabalan.\n\n\nHe said on Tuesday that government bodies are not set up to perform\nthat role.\n\n\nThey should let the private sector negotiate deals overseas, and\nprovide " technical backup" when needed.\n\n\nIt would be " putting things the wrong way round\' if the government\nbodies were the ones to assess the risks of a deal.\n\n\n" It would be a mistake for them to do so, as they do not have the\nexpertise for that," he said.\n\n\nHe noted that statutory boards have come to know many local suppliers\nand contractors over the years.\n\n\n\'They can and should help these people, if they want help, to do\nbusiness elsewhere," he said.\n\n\nGiving an example, he said a contractor who had done work for the\nPort of Singapore Authority ( PSA) could use those credentials to try to win\nan overseas project, and even draw on PSA\'s expertise if necessary.\n\n\nGovernment bodies should change their present attitude that it was\nnot their business to help local companies obtain deals abroad.\n\n\nBut they should not be expected to go overseas and secure business to\ngive to local firms as they are not equipped to do so.\n\n\nHe said a successful example of Government-private sector\nco-operation is Jurong Town Corporation\'s investment in a Thai industrial\nestate together with the private sector.\n\n\nMr Dhanabalan\'s comments came amid a nationwide discussion on the\nneed for the economy to sprout a second wing.\n\n\nSenior Minister Lee Kuan Yew recently said that statutory boards,\nGovernment-linked companies ( GLCs) and private firms need to pool their\nresources to succeed abroad.\n\n\nHe said they have to trust each other and share information on the\nregion.\n\n\nPrivate-sector companies have complained to him that statutory boards\nand GLCs held them at arm\'s length and were unhappy at the prospect of\npartnering Singapore entrepreneurs of questionable reputation.\n\n\nTuesday\'s 90-minute interview was Mr Dhanabalan\'s first with the\npress since he took over Brigadier General ( Res) Lee Hsien Loong\'s Trade and\nIndustry portfolio last December.\n\n\nHe is standing in for the Deputy Prime Minister, who had been\nundergoing chemotherapy for cancer.\n\n\nMr Dhanabalan also disclosed in the interview that the Committee to\nPromote Enterprise Overseas, chaired by Minister of State ( Finance and\nCommunications) Commodore ( Res) Teo Chee Hean, would be looking further into\nthe role of government bodies in regionalisation efforts.\n\n\nHe said the Government would like to change the mentality of\nbureaucrats and the small and medium sized enterprises ( SMEs) so that they\ncan work better together.\n\n\nNoting that SMEs often find bureaucrats unsympathetic, Mr Dhanabalan\nsaid this was untrue as the Government has given them a lot of assistance "\nThey expect the Government to just scatter money but the Government can\'t do\nthat.\n\n\nIt has to insist on proper assessment of business proposals.\n\n\n" The businessman can put his own money on a hunch but if he is asked\nto justify and quantify his hunch, he gets upset.\n\n\nIf that is so, then nothing can be changed," he said.\n\n\nIn contrast, the GLCs were more like private firms and should not be\nput in the same category as statutory boards and other government bodies.\n\n\nThey have been successful so far because the Government does not\ninterfere with them. \n\n\n\n\nThe Straits Time interview with S. Dhanabalan\n\n\n Asean countries will lose their credibility if Afta fails \n\n\nSingapore will be involved in any move that will mean greater access\nto markets\n\n\nby Chan Hwa Loon\n\n\nTHE Asean countries would lose their credibility if the Asean Free\nTrade Area ( Afta) fails and becomes another version of the moribund\nPreferential Trading Arrangement, said Mr S. Dhanabalan.\n\n\nThe Trade and Industry Minister said in an interview on Tuesday that\nthe schedules put up by the Asean countries to implement Afta were " a little\ndifferent" from expected.\n\n\nBut he felt that the end point would still be the same - - that under\nthe fast track, the tariffs would be reduced to a minimum of 5 per cent in\nseven to 10 years, and under the normal track, in 10 to 15 years.\n\n\nEven as Singapore rolls back its tariffs under Afta, it is prepared\nto join other free trade areas if conditions are right and if they are not\ninward-looking.\n\n\n\'We want to be involved in any move that will mean greater access to\nmarkets.\n\n\nNafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement, would be the nearest\npotential free trade area but nothing has moved yet.\n\n\nHe noted that although Afta\'s progress was slow, the Asean countries\nhad made a start and Asean leaders have come a long way in recognising that\nAfta cannot afford to fail.\n\n\nMr Dhanabalan said he would " wait and see", as it was " still a bit\nearly in the day" to pass judgment on Afta.\n\n\nIn his view, Afta is not significant enough yet to make Asean a\ncompetitive destination for foreign investments.\n\n\nTuesday\'s 90-minute interview - - which covered issues ranging from\nthe Singapore economy to regionalisation efforts - - was Mr Dhanabalan\'s\nfirst with the press since he took over the Trade and Industry portfolio last\nDecember from Brig-Gen ( Res) Lee Hsien Loong.\n\n\nOn protectionism, most people still remembered the 1930s when world\ntrade contracted tremendously because of trade barriers.\n\n\nBut there are fears among analysts that the baby boom generation in\nthe US did not have memories of what happened then and may resort to tariff\nbarriers to solve their present economic problems.\n\n\nIf they do that, " they will very soon find that they are severely\nburnt" as even regional trading blocs like Nafta and the European Community (\nEC) had strong trade links with other economies.\n\n\n" So, they must face up to the consequence of a significant part, or\nmaybe a greater part, of their trade being affected if they become too\ninward-looking."\n\n\nMr Dhanabalan added: " I see that as a kind of a natural safety\nfactor against an inward-looking trend.\n\n\nBut this of course presumes that people work and think logically and\nrationally.\n\n\n" Sometimes the hard reality of logic can be diverted by immediate\npolitical pressures."\n\n\nGrowth of Chinese market need not be at expense of other areas\n\n\nTHE liberalisation and growth of the Chinese market is not a zero sum\ngame and would not be at the expense of other areas such as the Growth\nTriangle, said Trade and Industry Minister S. Dhanabalan.\n\n\nMr Dhanabalan said in an interview with The Straits Times on Tuesday\nthat although China is a large country with vast resources, it is not a\nself-contained economy.\n\n\nHence, as the country grows its relationship with the world will also\ngrow and it does not mean that foreign companies would stop investing\nelsewhere.\n\n\nThe minister was responding to a point made by some economists that\nthe Growth Triangle, covering Singapore, Johor and Indonesia\'s Riau region,\nwould become less attractive to investors as a result of the investment boom\nin south China - - if nothing is done to accelerate the project.\n\n\nMr Dhanabalan said that Batam, one leg of the triangle, is attractive\nto investors because it can ride on Singapore\'s infrastructure.\n\n\nLocal investors who go to Batam may not be competing in the same end\nmarket as those going to China.\n\n\nAnd even if they are, other factors like consistency and certainty of\npolicies, undertakings and commitments would set the two apart.\n\n\n" Certainly, many companies here have more experience in Indonesia\nthan in China," he said.\n\n\nRepublic \'must watch developments in Japan and EC carefully\'\nSINGAPORE would have to watch developments in Japan and the European\nCommunity carefully as the impact of their economic slowdown has not been\nfelt here, said Mr S Dhanabalan.\n\n\nThe Trade and Industry Minister said this in an interview on Tuesday\nin reply to a question on whether he thought the effects of the European and\nJapanese recession have trickled down to Singapore.\n\n\nMr Dhanabalan said that so far Singapore has avoided being hard hit\nby adverse conditions abroad because it managed to stay competitive.\n\n\nThe most competitive products would be the last to be cut back in an\neconomic slowdown and the first to experience an increase in demand when the\neconomy recovers.\n\n\nIn the\n\n\npast, before recessions in these countries could affect Singapore\ntheir economies had started to pick up again. \n\n\nSaid Mr Dhanabalan, " This underscores the need for us to be very\ncareful about our competitiveness.\n\n\nWe must never reach the point where our exports would be among the\nfirst to be cut off in a recession."', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1f3de0fc-7c28-4308-8d0b-98071298dbc6', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.789033+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9765602946281433, 'non_english_score': 0.02343970537185669}
{'text': 'Straits Times April 5, 1993\n\n\n Unconducive and cramped work place among complaints \n\n\nby Rachel Tan\n\n\nTEACHERS at Pasir Ris Secondary seek retreat from work stress in a\nlounge right in their school, a pastel-coloured, carpeted room as cosy as\nhome.\n\n\nThe mauve painted lounge, complete with dimmers, a comfortable settee,\nand shelves stocked with reading material, is also equipped with a karaoke\nset for the teachers.\n\n\nThis aspect of the school is atypical of most government schools where\nteachers complain about an unconducive work environment, like poorly\nventilated and cramped work spaces.\n\n\nBut this is set to change.\n\n\nThe Education Ministry is going to ensure that adequate work space is\nprovided and staff rooms are air-conditioned.\n\n\nIn fact, other changes are in store.\n\n\nThe Straits Times spoke to 20 teachers in primary, secondary and\njunior colleges about the impending changes and the results of a teacher\nsurvey.\n\n\nBut all those interviewed refused to give their full names or\ninitials.\n\n\nThere\'s homework too.\n\n\nThe survey found that teachers work six to eight hours a day in\nschool.\n\n\nBut those who spoke to The Straits Times said more work is done at\nhome,up to about two hours a day.\n\n\nAs Mrs Li, a secondary school teacher, said: " Most days I have to\nbring home books to mark because there is just no time to do that in school.\n\n\nMy spare time in school is spent on administrative duties like\ncollecting fees, marking registers, planning the curriculum, organising\nschool activities like Founders Day and overseeing ECA " I also have four\nhours of remedial classes a week and need to make time for my pupils to\nconsult me about their work between lessons."\n\n\nPrimary and junior college teachers cited similarly long hours,\nalthough their duties vary somewhat.\n\n\nWhile teachers could benefit from having the ministry\'s promise of\nmore support staff to perform the clerical chores, they could also probably\nbenefit from time management courses.\n\n\nSaid Mrs Wong, who quit her job recently after over 10 years of\nservice: " We juggled many duties.\n\n\nSome teachers worked fast and did minimal work at home while the\nslower ones were forever marking books.\n\n\nI did all my marking in school so I needed to prepare the curriculum\nat home - - this alone took me at least five hours a week." One teacher, many\nroles?\n\n\nPressure from parents and principals for teachers to play multiple\nroles as educators, mentors, role-models and counsellors place great strain\non the teachers.\n\n\nSaid an English teacher in a primary school: " Much as I would like\nto play the ideal teacher, I have other roles: as mother, wife and daughter\nto my family."\n\n\nAdded another teacher: " Each role suffers given the demands on our\njobs." Her solution?\n\n\nDefine the teacher\'s role clearly and employ specialists, like social\nworkers, who can complement their work.\n\n\nAn option is to increase the teacher-student ratio.\n\n\nTeachers also cited unrealistic expectations of principals and\nparents as a main concern.\n\n\nThe English teacher said: " They can\'t expect us to turn the average\nstudent with 50 % passes into a star performer scoring 90%.\n\n\nWe\'re educators, not miracle workers."\n\n\nIn service courses good, but...\n\n\nWhile teachers are generally satisfied with the range and content of\nin service courses, some are reluctant to attend them.\n\n\nSome teachers find they are exhausted at the end of the day.\n\n\nThey may attend a course from 8 am to noon, then rush to school for\nlessons from 1 p.m to 6.30 p.m Said a teacher: " We\'re so exhausted that\ngiven the choice we would rather forfeit the chance to upgrade ourselves.."\nOn sabbaticals and no-pay leave, some teachers suggested that the ministry be\nmore flexible.\n\n\nSaid a junior college teacher: " We get burnt out.\n\n\nIt\'s difficult for us to apply for time off because we are so\nunderstaffed." Storeroom of a work environment Teachers are glad that the MOE\nintends to upgrade their cramped working quarters by installing air\nconditioning and providing adequate work space in the staff rooms.\n\n\nSaid Mrs Paramita Bandara, principal of Pasir Ris Secondary: " We\nhave about 70 teachers and our staff room is so short of space that it looks\nlike a store room.\n\n\nObviously it was designed by non users." Closer partners in the\nmaking Teachers welcome the steps the ministry intends to take to show that\nit is interested in feedback from teachers.\n\n\nSaid teacher Ms L Tan: " While there\'s a lot of emphasis on how to\nattract new teachers, the ministry should consider even more ways of\nretaining those already on the job." \n\n\n\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES, MONDAY, MARCH 29, 1993\n\n\n Caution\'s the word for students at Aussie varsity fair \n\n\nThey are worried about low entry requirements\n\n\nBy Rachel Tan\n\n\nTHEY may be keen on pursuing a degree, but they will not compromise\nstandards.\n\n\nSingapore school leavers who are looking at educational opportunities\nin Australia say they are worried about the low entry requirements.\n\n\nAt an exhibition put up by 48 Australian educational institutions\nhere, they ask the universities to name their brightest academics as one way\nof checking whether they would be enrolling into a good university.\n\n\nOn their part, the Australians say that they provide enough\ninformation for the students to make an informed choice.\n\n\nThe three-day exhibition, which ended yesterday, attracted about\n5,000 people.\n\n\nAn estimated 700 people visited the exhibition within three hours of\nits opening.\n\n\nMost were A-level school leavers looking at prospective undergraduate\nor foundation courses.\n\n\nBecause of the purported hard sell of the Australian education\nindustry here, these school-leavers were concerned that the institutions\nmight be using marketing hype to get fee paying students in.\n\n\nThey tread carefully when selecting their schools, and some come\narmed with notepads filled with questions for the universities\'\nrepresentatives.\n\n\nMiss Kang Mei Ling, 19, who is planning to do a medical course, is\none who has done her research.\n\n\nBesides the usual questions about course content and living expenses,\nshe also asked representatives about their recent medical breakthroughs,\ntheir most well-known academics and the current areas of research that they\nare pursuing.\n\n\n" I can check it up so don\'t lie to me", is her attitude towards the\nhard sell at the exhibition.\n\n\nShe intends to verify her information by checking with libraries,\nprofessional bodies and friends who have studied in Australia.\n\n\nLike her, Eugene Tan, 20, intends to make a thorough comparison of\nthe entry requirements for the different universities.\n\n\nSaid the national serviceman, who intends to pursue a humanities\ncourse:\n\n\n" I would worry if the entry standards set are too low, as there\nmight be a catch to the degree."\n\n\nHe also intends to check if potential employers will recognise the\ndegrees he is interested in.\n\n\nThe Australian Trade Commission ( Austrade), which is organising the\nfair is aware that these concerns have been raised because of the perceived\nhard sell by the universities.\n\n\nSaid a spokesman: " If the universities lower standards or give\nmisleading information, it would be at the risk of their reputations.\n\n\nOur best marketing strategy is still word of mouth."\n\n\nThe trade commission told the students to visit the Australian\nEducation Centre for further " impartial counselling" about their schools,\nand reassured applicants that the Australian government has legislation to\nprotect overseas students.\n\n\nFor example, all institutions holding courses for overseas students\nhave to have their curriculum and even campus facilities endorsed by the\ngovernment.\n\n\nFurthermore, financial legislation ensures that government-funded\nuniversities, secondary schools and polytechnics are in no danger of\nfinancial collapse.\n\n\nStill, caution is the keyword for many.\n\n\nSaid Dave Chung, 22, who is looking for a business course: " Do not\nrely too much on the glossy brochures and the marketing hype.\n\n\n" An informed choice can be made by knowing what you want, asking the\nright questions and checking it up with alumni and other unbiased parties\nlike teachers and friends.\n\n\n\n\nIVF programme:\n\n\nHusbands need support groups as well MEN with wives in the in-vitro\nfertility ( IVF) programme should join support groups to help them through\nthe " private hell" they go through when they fail repeatedly to conceive.\n\n\nWhile it is acknowledged that the women suffer the physical and\nemotional trauma that comes with repeated attempts and failures to become\npregnant, few people know what the men go through.\n\n\nThis call was made yesterday by 25 current and former patients of the\nSingapore General Hospital\'s Centre for Assisted Reproduction ( Care) at a\ncelebration marking Care\'s fifth anniversary.\n\n\nThe 25 have started an informal support group at the centre.\n\n\nAbout 50 IVF children and their families attended the celebrations.\n\n\nIn-vitro fertilisation occurs when a woman\'s egg is fertilised in a\nlaboratory dish and then transferred back into her womb.\n\n\nMore than 20O babies have been born to Care since the centre opened\nin March 1988.\n\n\nDuring the celebrations, the centre asked current and former patients\nof the centre to join the support group, which will be registered within six\nmonths and acknowledged that while women remain the group\'s prime focus, the\nmen need support, too.\n\n\nMen may initially have to face the fear that they may be found to be\ninfertile - - which many think makes them less of a man.\n\n\nThen they have to cope with the daily sperm collections, blood tests,\nsex on demand, abstinence, and the long wait to see if they have succeeded.\n\n\nThis feeling of helplessness is intensified when the couple fails to\nconceive after repeated trials.\n\n\nSaid Mrs Marilynn Woo, a former Care patient who now has a\none-year-old IVF baby: " My husband was very excited when I first got\npregnant.\n\n\nHe told everyone and bought baby clothes.\n\n\n" When we lost the baby he became just as depressed as I was and even\nrefused to look at baby things anymore because of the fear that we might not\nsee the new baby through."\n\n\nThe trials do not end when the woman gets pregnant either.\n\n\nWhile all the attention is focussed on her, the husband is largely\nforgotten, although the pregnancy takes an emotional toll on him as well.\n\n\nSaid one husband, who declined to be named: " It was a trying time as\nshe was suffering from severe mood swings because of the hormone injections\nneeded to keep her womb from spontaneously aborting the baby.\n\n\n" This was something I had to try hard to understand, and it helped\nto meet other husbands with problems like mine to whom I could voice my\nanxieties."\n\n\nSaid Mr Tom Werry, 48, father of two IVF boys: " As a father who has\ngone through the programme, I could share my experiences so that anyone going\nthrough it can feel more comfortable and less alone."\n\n\nOnce the support group is registered, it aims to provide moral\nsupport for Care patients as well as administrative support for seminars and\ntalks for couples who have difficulty conceiving.\n\n\nIt hopes that this will increase awareness and encourage couples to\ncome forward and seek help for their fertility problems.\n\n\nYesterday\'s celebrations also featured talks by Professor Maureen\nTsakok, Head of Singapore General Hospital\'s Care and the Obstetrics and\nGynaecology Department, and Dr Ho Lai Yun, the head of the Department of\nNeonatology.\n\n\nProf Tsakok spoke about the Care programme and the progress it has\nmade over the last five years.\n\n\nAbout 33 % of the couples in SGH\'s IVF programme have successfully\nhad babies, compared with the national figure of 14.8 % culled from the\ncombined success rate for all the six fertility centres - - Kandang Kerbau\nHospital, SGH, National University Hospital, Mount Elizabeth Hospital,\nThomson Medical Centre and Gleneagles Hospital.\n\n\nDr Ho revealed that about 1.5 % of babies born each year in Singapore\nare IVF babies.\n\n\nHe added that while their mothers faced high-risk pregnancies - -\nwith premature babies that might initially need intensive neonatal care - -\nthe babies they had " are not different from any non IVF baby and should thus\nbe treated the same way."\n\n\nThere is no reason to show that IVF babies do worse than non IVF\nbabies on developmental tests of intelligence or physical ability.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'eb96ca28-1596-4e75-8b38-4ecb8b3b4ff0', 'added':

He noted that the courts had\nincreased significantly the number of cases it heard last year.\n\n\nFor example, more than 35,600 claims were settled in the Small Claims\nTribunal last year, a 70 per cent jump over l991.\n\n\nThe number of civil cases dealt with in the court was also up 20 per\ncent to 1832 cases last year while 10,349 criminal cases were heard, a 14 per\ncent increase over l991.\n\n\nThe result: Almost all of the backlog of cases which built up between\nl983 and 1991 had been dealt with.\n\n\nThe remaining few would be heard by June.\n\n\nSome of the steps taken to speed up the administration of justice\nincluded holding pre-trial conferences to ensure that the parties were\nproperly prepared before their cases came up and introducing more night court\nsessions.\n\n\nThe system of charging hearing fees for civil cases going to trial,\nintroduced last July, also meant that parties had to make a more realistic\nassessment of their cases before seeking more of the courts limited hearing\ntime.\n\n\nAs a result the number of civil cases coming up for hearing fell by\n15 per cent since the system was introduced.\n\n\nAsked about complaints from some lawyers that the changes had meant a\nback-breaking pace of work, he said: These are just birth pangs.\n\n\nWe are going through a major change in work practices and culture.\n\n\nAfter a while, we will all get used to it, and be the better for it."\n\n\n\n\n\n PM to S\'poreans: Lift your sights and focus on national interests\n\n\n\n Staying ahead economically as a nation more important than\ncommunal matters \n\n\nBy Warren Fernandez\n\n\nStraits Times June 6, 1993\n\n\nSINGAPOREANS must focus on the challenges facing the country, such as\nhow to stay ahead of the economic competition, and not be preoccupied with\ncommunity issues, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said last night.\n\n\nHe said that while each ethnic community had its own problems which\nneeded attention, these could only be addressed after overriding national\ninterests had been met.\n\n\nSpeaking at a dinner to mark the 60th anniversary of Jamiyah, the\nMuslim Missionary Society of Singapore, he urged the Malay community to focus\nmore on national issues and to see Malay issues from a national perspective..\n\n\nThis applied to the Chinese-speaking community as well, he added,\nsaying that unless the various communities here lifted their sights, and saw\nthe woods and not just the trees, Singapore would lose its bearings.\n\n\nThe basic, perennial issue facing the country was how to stay ahead\nof the economic competition, he said, reiterating a theme that has dominated\nhis recent speeches.\n\n\n" Malay Singaporeans, like other Singaporeans, will have to worry\nabout basic issues, like making a living, and how to sustain progress in the\nlight of challenging regional and global developments.\n\n\n" These issues will affect the well-being of your community.\n\n\nYour community\'s problems cannot be resolved in isolation.\n\n\nThey can only be resolved in the context of the nation, and after\noverriding national interests have been resolved," he said.\n\n\nMr Goh began his 20-minute speech to about 1,000 guests at the\ndinner, held at the Orchard Hotel, by commending Jamiyah for its non-communal\napproach to community issues.\n\n\nThis enabled Malays and non-Malays to support its welfare and\neducational programmes, he said.\n\n\nTo gauge the current concerns of the Malay community, he said that he\nhad asked the Information and the Arts Ministry to go through issues of\nBerita Harian, the Malay daily, over the last two months.\n\n\nThe survey revealed that the topics most on Malay minds were: the\nattendance of Malay students in the madrasah or Islamic schools, Malay youths\nin teenage gangs, Malay participation in investments, the sale of non-halal\nmeat and the use of English in Malay homes.\n\n\nWhile these issues needed to be addressed as they were important to\nthe development of the community, they were not the most serious issues\nfacing the Malay community in the future, he said.\n\n\nThe same might be said of, the Chinese-speaking community, he\ncontinued, recounting how he was struck by the similarities in the tenor and\ntone of two separate dialogues for Malay- and Chinese-speaking Singaporeans,\nheld by the Feedback Unit.\n\n\nNational issues were hardly discussed.\n\n\nInstead, participants had spent an undue amount of time on evergreen\nissues such as the status and use of the Malay language, and the status,\nstandards, teaching, learning and use of the Chinese language.\n\n\nUnless Singaporeans tackled the bigger issue of how to raise their\nstandard of living further, he said, they would not be creating the wealth\nneeded to solve the problems of each community.\n\n\nGiving examples of the intense economic competition ahead, he noted\nthat Penang had attracted high-tech investments, while Labuan was being built\nup as a tax haven and a financial centre.\n\n\nIndonesia was building bigger ports in Batam and West Java, which\ncould result in less of its cargo passing through Singapore.\n\n\nAnd Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok both aimed to be the aviation hubs of\nthe region.\n\n\nWarning that Singapore risked becoming a \'has-been\' if it did not\nstay ahead of the competition, he said: " If our services are not better than\nothers, what else can we do?\n\n\nThis question will have to be answered by all Singaporeans,\nregardless of the specific issues which engross the different communities."\n\n\nMr Goh, who was welcomed on his arrival by a Malay kompang band, was\nlater presented with a kris by Jamiyah.\n\n\nSeveral guests interviewed last night agreed with the Prime\nMinister\'s message.\n\n\nAdministrative manager Khalid Hassan, 37, said: " Most Malays would\nagree that we need to focus on the bigger picture, as Singapore is facing a\nlot of competition.\n\n\n" But with more immediate day-to-day concerns, they may need to be\nreminded."\n\n\nSaid Mr Umar Abdul Hamid, an MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC: " I think the\nMalay community is mature enough to look beyond its present concerns and\ncontribute to the national debate on how to secure the future." Another BT\njournalist charged with breaching Official Secrets Act By Warren Fernandez\nANOTHER Business Times ( BT) journalist was charged in court yesterday with\nbreaching the Official Secrets Act, just three days before a joint trial of\nfour other men for a related offence was to begin on Monday.\n\n\nTechnology editor Kenneth James, 45, was charged with receiving and\npassing on information relating to the official flash estimates of\nSingapore\'s economic growth in the second quarter of last year.\n\n\nJames, an economics correspondent with the newspaper at the time of\nthe alleged offence, pleaded not guilty and was released on a\n&dollar;5,000 bail.\n\n\nAt a separate hearing later yesterday, Senior District Judge Richard\nMagnus ruled that in the light of this development, the two-week trial\nscheduled to begin on Monday would be adjourned.\n\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Errol Foenander yesterday declined to say\nwhy the new charges were brought against James at this late stage.\n\n\n" Of course, I cannot reveal the reasons, " he told reporters after\nthe pre-trial hearing.\n\n\nJames was one of several BT staffers interviewed by the Internal\nSecurity Department soon after seven ISD officers searched BT\'s offices last\nAugust.\n\n\nThe two charges against him relate to a BT report published on June\n29 last year, a few days before the flash estimates - - quick, initial\ncalculations - - of Singapore\'s growth had been released officially.\n\n\nFour men were charged last December on nine counts of breaching the\nOSA in connection with the BT report.\n\n\nThey are Tharman Shanmugaratnam, 35, director of the Monetary\nAuthority of Singapore\'s economics department, Manu Bhaskaran, 34, Crosby\nSecurities\' economic research director; Raymond Foo Jong Chen, 28, a Crosby\nregional economist; and Business Times editor Patrick Daniel, 38.\n\n\nAll four were in court yesterday.\n\n\nIf found guilty, they each face a maximum sentence of a\n&dollar;2,000 fine or two years\' jail, or both.\n\n\nYesterday, Mr Foenander applied to have James tried jointly with the\nother four accused men.\n\n\nHe said the prosecution was prepared to go ahead with the trial next\nweek, if the defence agreed to a joint trial.\n\n\nCounsel for James, Mr Harry Elias, however, pointed out that his\nclient had been arrested on Thursday night and charged yesterday.\n\n\nHe therefore needed more time to decide whether to agree to a joint\ntrial and to prepare his client\'s defence. \n\n\n" There is so much to do in so little time.\n\n\nIn fairness to my client and myself, it would be difficult to begin\non Monday," he said.\n\n\nMr Foenander replied that he was not seeking an adjournment, but if\nthe defence sought to have the hearing postponed, he would not object to it.\n\n\nCounsel for Shanmugaratnam, Manu and Daniel, however, argued that as\nthe prosecution had not asked for an adjournment, the court should proceed\nwith the hearing on Monday.\n\n\nUrging the judge not to postpone the trial, counsel for Bhaskaran,\nMr Michael Khoo, said: " These are serious charges that have hung over my\nclient for the last few months, and we want the trial to go ahead as soon as\npossible.\n\n\n" There can be no reason to delay the trial just because the\nprosecution has, at the eleventh hour, added additional charges." Agreeing,\nMr K.\n\n\nShanmugam, counsel for Daniel, added that since the prosecution was\nnot making an application for an adjournment, the court could go ahead with\nthe trial, and consider if James should be tried with the rest some time next\nweek.\n\n\n" If the arguments for a joint trial are thrown out, then we would\nnot have wasted two weeks," he said.\n\n\nA further complication arose when Mr Tan Kok Quan, counsel for Foo,\napplied to be discharged from representing his client, saying recent\ndevelopments had put him in " a conflict situation".\n\n\nFoo agreed to discharge his counsel, adding that he expected to\nappoint a new lawyer by later yesterday.\n\n\nThe new lawyer, he said, was prepared to go ahead with the case\nnext Monday.\n\n\nTo resolve these matters the judge asked Mr Elias, counsel for\nJames, how long he would need to prepare his arguments on whether his client\nshould be tried jointly with the others.\n\n\nThe lawyer said while he would like to have two weeks he could do\nso by tomorrow adding " if need be, we will burn the midnight oil".\n\n\nBut he said he could not be expected to prepare his client\'s\ndefence by Monday.\n\n\nFurthermore, he would be tied up with another case in the High\nCourt for 10 days from June 28.\n\n\nThe judge then decided to adjourn the case and schedule a pre-trial\nconference for next Friday to settle the issue of whether the five men should\nbe tried jointly and fix new dates for the hearing.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '450c908f-9c3e-4629-9087-87d7e3f5d8ac', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.791648+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9785163998603821, 'non_english_score': 0.02148360013961792}
{'text': 'Straits Times April 5, 1993\n\n\n Teachers\' working conditions to be improved: MOE \n\n\nBy Leong Chan Teik\n\n\nTHE Education Ministry will take several measures to improve the\nworking conditions of teachers in response to feedback gathered from them.\n\n\nIt will provide teachers with more support staff to take care of\nnon-teaching needs.\n\n\nIt will also air-condition school staff rooms.\n\n\nElaborating on the report of a 1991 survey which it circulated to\nteachers last week, the ministry said that there was an on-going programme to\nbuild new schools with more facilities and to upgrade existing school]s.\n\n\nIt said the Finance Ministry had approved the air-conditioning of\nselected areas such as staff rooms in all schools with effect from this year.\n\n\nTeachers will not have to wait long for the installation.\n\n\nThe ministry said it would also set up more channels of communication\nas it now had infrequent contact with teachers.\n\n\nIt also addressed another perennial complaint of teachers that they\nhave to do chores unrelated to their professional duties.\n\n\nThe ministry said it would set aside\n&dollar;2 million for schools to hire more support staff.\n\n\nIn addition, each school may spend up to 20 per cent of the\n&dollar;l00,000 annual Edusave grant it receives on support services.\n\n\nSome measures had been announced earlier.\n\n\nThe ministry was elaborating in response to questions from The\nStraits Times.\n\n\nIt said the release of the report, completed last April, had been\nplanned since then.\n\n\nThe release, it said, was not in response to grouses raised at a\ndialogue between the ministry and the Singapore Teachers\' Union ( STU) which\nwas publicised recently in the union\'s newsletter and in the press.\n\n\nThe main grouse raised there was that the teachers\' workload had\nbecome very heavy because principals were anxious about the annual school\nranking exercise which was begun last year.\n\n\nThese are the survey\'s findings:  * TEACHER ACTIVlTIES \n\n\nOn average, teachers spend between six and eight hours a day on\nprofessional duties in school.\n\n\nAbout an hour is spent on other duties.\n\n\nMr Ying Cheok Ping, STU\'s general secretary, commented that teachers\nalso spent time at home, sometimes until midnight, marking students\' work and\npreparing lessons.\n\n\nIn the survey, many highlighted the need for more support staff to\nperform tasks such as collecting school fees, typing, photocopying and\nstapling examination papers and tests.\n\n\n * WORKLOAD \n\n\nTeachers were unanimous in saying that examination time was when they\nfelt the greatest demands of them.\n\n\nThey also felt pressed by heightened public interest in education\nmatters.\n\n\nThey wanted clearer definitions of what was expected of them since\nthey assume the roles of educator, mentor, role-model and counsellor.\n\n\n * TRAINING \n\n\nTeachers are satisfied with in-service courses and workshops, which\nthey described as useful.\n\n\nSome indicated that a basic course in counselling would benefit all\nteachers.\n\n\nChinese language teachers suggested they be sent to Beijing and\nTaiwan for visits and lecture programmes.\n\n\n* WORK ENVIRONMENT: Teachers complained about noise, lack of privacy,\nphysical discomfort because of the weather, and inadequate storage for books.\n\n\nThe ministry will draw up guidelines on teacher responsibilities,\nincluding items such as extra-curricular activities in timetables to reflect\nteachers\' workloads more accurately.\n\n\nIt will also review the focus of in-service training periodically to\nensure that it meets teachers\' needs.\n\n\nThose who teach mother tongues will continue to be sent for overseas\ntraining.\n\n\nTwenty-two will go this year and overseas trainers may be brought so\nmore can benefit.\n\n\nSTU\'s Mr Ying said: " It has become apparent for some time that the\ndemands on teachers has increased." Referring to their non-professional\nduties, he said: " Many find these tasks have interfered with their\nteaching." He added: " We welcome the ministry\'s follow-up actions.\n\n\nSTU is pleased to note that the ministry has shown that it is serious\nabout working in that direction." \n\n\n\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES, TUESDAY, JUNE 8, 1993\n\n\n S\'pore children meet friends from many nations - - in Japan \n\n\nBy Leon Chan Teik\n\n\nFEW Singaporeans have any inkling where or what Latvia is, but\n11-year-old Raihainah Ramlee has met several children from this Baltic\nrepublic.\n\n\nThanks to the sponsorship of various organisations and regional\ngovernments in Japan, a number of Singapore\'s 11- and 12-year-olds have been\nable to visit Japan on cultural and friendship programmes involving children\nfrom all over the world.\n\n\nOn one such trip in April Raihainah of Min Xin Primary in Bedok and\nfive pupils from Nanyang and Rosyth primary schools stayed in Kobe for 10\ndays at the invitation of the city\'s mayor.\n\n\nThe organisers paid for their expenses and that of Min Xin\'s\nprincipal Mrs Helen Tan, who chaperoned the children.\n\n\nThe occasion was the World Children\'s Forum, held in conjunction with\nUnicef Week Last week, 20 pupils from Northland Primary in Yishun, their\nprincipal, Mrs Thio Soei Ho, and some teachers flew off to Japan on another\n10 day programme.\n\n\nThe organiser of the programmes is a Japanese volunteer group,\nChildren\'s Communication on Earth.\n\n\nIt has no political or religious connections.\n\n\nIts objective is to promote international ties among children.\n\n\nGoing by responses of pupils like Raihainah, the programmes are a\nsuccess.\n\n\n" I learnt about friendship and made many new friends in Japan," she\nsaid.\n\n\nSince returning home, she has been keeping in touch with her\nnew-found friends including those from Latvia.\n\n\nShe added that she was fascinated with the richness of the different\ncultures as depicted during a performance put up by participants.\n\n\nFor Trisha Lee of Nanang Primary, who went on the same trip, being\naway from home by herself for the first time made her a more responsible\nperson, she said.\n\n\nHer mother, Mrs Lianne Lee, a housewife, agreed.\n\n\n" I find she has matured a lot.\n\n\nI used to have to ask her to do her work but now she is more\nsensible." She added: " She has become more caring too." Every day Trisha was\nin Japan, she called home.\n\n\nThe phone bill ran to about S150.\n\n\nMrs Tan, their chaperone, was not surprised that her charges had "\ngrown up".\n\n\nThey really had to look out for themselves.\n\n\nMost of them have maids at home.\n\n\nThey had never made their own beds.\n\n\nBut some days in Japan, they had to wash their own clothes." While\nsharing her daughter\'s happiness over the trip, Raihainah\'s mother, Madam\nRohaiyah Mohd Noor, worried a lot, too.\n\n\n" My daughter and I have never been apart like this.\n\n\nI felt very down.\n\n\nShe is my only child and I\'m a single parent," said the clerical\nofficer.\n\n\nAnother Singaporean group was invited to Japan early this year.\n\n\nIt was made up of 12 football players in Primary 5 or 6, selected\nfrom eight schools.\n\n\nThey played two friendly matches with their hosts, who paid for most\nof the expenses But soccer was not the most important item on the agenda,\nsaid Mr Mat Ariff, 47, the soccer adviser to Singapore schools who\naccompanied them.\n\n\nAbove all else, the Japanese viewed the occasion as a cultural\nexchange programme, he said.\n\n\nThey got the Singaporeans to stay with the families of the Japanese\nfootballers for two nights to experience Japanese hospitality.\n\n\nNext month, eight 11-year-olds will be taking yet another\nall-expenses paid trip to Japan.\n\n\nThis time, the pupils from Anglo-Chinese, Raffles Girls, Mayflower,\nChongzheng, Jin Tai and St Andrew\'s primary schools will be there for the 5th\nAsian Pacific Children convention.\n\n\nMoney back promise with this card By Leong Chan Teik THE first stored\nvalue cards here which no one but the owner can use will be available soon.\n\n\nA local electronics company, Signetics Systems, has been appointed by\na subsidiary of Japanese telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and\nTelephone Corporation ( NTT) to market cards which can be blacklisted once\nthey are reported lost.\n\n\nA spokesman for Goldtron, the parent company of Signetics, said its\ncards are the first here with that feature.\n\n\nIn contrast, other prepaid cards, such as phone cards, can be used by\nany bearer.\n\n\nAn owner who has lost his card can be compensated for the remaining\nvalue after a computer has tracked its earlier purchases.\n\n\nBut for that - - and to prevent fraudulent claims - - organisations\nusing the card system will need to keep particulars of the card buyers, as\norganisations in Japan do.\n\n\nGoldtron is targeting its cards at " closed systems" - department\nstores, fast food chains, supermarkets, petrol stations and restaurants.\n\n\nThe card is good for different types of transactions.\n\n\nFor instance, at a participating shopping centre, it can be used to\npay for goods and car park charges.\n\n\nSignetics is signing an agreement on Monday with U-Card Incorporated,\nan NTT subsidiary, to market the cards here and in the region, and manage the\ncard systems.\n\n\nU-Card Inc will design and manufacture the cards.\n\n\nSignetics\'s first client is NTUC\'s Pasir Ris Resort.\n\n\nThis came after a seven-month trial ending in May, said Mr Charlie\nGoh, the resort\'s personnel and marketing manager.\n\n\nUnder the system, the resort\'s 320 staff slot their cards into a "\nreader" for meals in the resort\'s cafeteria.\n\n\nA &dollar;3 value is deducted each time from the card which has a stored value of\n&dollar;75 and is valid for a month.\n\n\nPreviously, they had to search for their name against a staff list\nand sign against it.\n\n\nThe resort has ordered a year\'s supply of 40,000 cards at a cost of\n&dollar;1.50 each.\n\n\nIt is looking into the possibility of extending the use of the card\nto regular visitors.\n\n\nNTT\'s cards, known as U-cards in Japan, are used in more than 10,000\nshops there, said NTT\'s chief representative here, Mr Hitoshi Kato.\n\n\nOne benefit of prepaid cards, he said, is that they will facilitate\ntransactions when the 3 per cent Goods and Services Tax is introduced here\nnext year.\n\n\nPayments are likely to involve loose change and one cent\ndenominations.\n\n\nCustomers using prepaid cards need not prepare the exact change or\naccept many coins.\n\n\nThe cards can also be used as gifts in place of vouchers, he said.\n\n\nPrepaid cards can also incorporate a bonus system, as found in cards\nfor Yishun\'s 10-cinema multiplex.\n\n\nFor a year now, it has been offering\n\n&dollar;45 transferable cards which allow patrons to buy 10 tickets costing\n&dollar;5 each - - which means that one is a bonus free ticket.\n\n\nSince January, the price of a ticket has gone up to\n&dollar;6, but patrons who use the prepaid cards can still buy 10 tickets.\n\n\nMrs Sally Crawford, a spokesman for the complex, said 15,000 cards\nhave been sold so far, and their popularity is increasing.\n\n\nA bonus system and the flexibility of being offered as gifts are\namong the features that will allow prepaid cards to hold their own when Nets\'\nCashcards are implemented nationwide in 1995, said industry sources.\n\n\nThe Cashcards can be used for a range of purposes.\n\n\nAsked about the blacklisting feature, Nets said this week that it is\nnot necessary for the Cashcard, when used as a substitute for cash, to have\nthat capability, " just as you would not generally blacklist currency notes\nyou lost." Cashcards which are combined with ATM card functions, however,\nwill be personalised, and it can be verified easily if the user is the owner,\nit added. \n\n\n\n\nStraits Times, June 24 1993\n\n\nPastor comforts dying motorcyclist\n\n\nA SINGAPORE pastor was on hand to comfort and pray for the dying Mr\nTan Kheng Sun.\n\n\nReverend Leslie Quahe, 35, himself a biker, helped Mr Tan " make\npeace with God", said tour organiser Rodney Yeo.\n\n\nA motorcycling enthusiast who rides a Honda NV 400, Rev Quahe of the\nChrist Methodist Church in East Coast Road switched to the motorcycle three\nyears ago when car and petrol prices started going up.\n\n\nHe was travelling on his first rally.\n\n\nHis wife, Lin Yun, 26, their nine-month-old daughter Ariel, and\nfamily members of other bikers went along in an accompanying 44-seater coach.\n\n\nSome bikers said that Mr Tan could have survived the accident if his\nhelmet had not fallen off.\n\n\nThey said he hit his head hard when he crashed onto the road.\n\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Madam Wong Souk Yee, 34, who was not on\nthe trip. \n\n\nThe couple have no children.\n\n\nShe was one of 22 people detained in 1987 for being involved in a\nMarxist plot to overthrow the Government.\n\n\nShe was released in 1989 after the Government decided that she was\nunlikely to resume subversive activities and pose a security threat.\n\n\nShe is a playwright and one of the founder members of the drama\ntroupe Third Stage.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0a6e0c84-097d-4f99-a335-8fd284a27151', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.792846+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9832367300987244, 'non_english_score': 0.016763269901275635}

The idea for the programme is a spin off\nfrom the Defence Familiarisation Programme for women, launched last year, for\nfinal-year female junior college students.\n\n\nThe idea to put trainee teachers through a similar programme was put\nforward by members of the Advisory Council on Community Relations In Defence\n( Accord) at Mindef in Bukit Gombak, where he officiated at a short ceremony\nto welcome four new members to the council, which he chairs.\n\n\nEleven members were re-appointed and four others retired after having\nserved between two and three years in Accord.\n\n\nAccord was formed in 1984 to seek increasing support and recognition\nfor national servicemen and reservists from their families, employers and\npeers.\n\n\nIt also helps to create awareness and understanding among the general\npublic of their roles in total Defence.\n\n\nDr Lee called the council " Mindef\'s best critics" and the first\npublic audience for policy changes and mass communication programmes.\n\n\nIts members hold senior positions in various sectors of the community\nsuch as grassroots organisations, schools, the business sector and\ngovernment.\n\n\nIn recalling some of the major contributions of Accord, Dr Lee said\nthat when Mindef first presented the Defence Familiarisation Programme for\nWomen to Accord, council members highlighted the need to involve teachers in\nthe programme as well.\n\n\nAccord members said that it would give teachers a better\nunderstanding of the SAF for general discussions with their students on\nSingapore\'s survival, security and success, noted Dr Lee.\n\n\nIn the nine-day programme for female junior college students,\nSingapore\'s national security issues were examined through group discussions\nand policy-gaming classroom sessions.\n\n\nThe group also stayed at an army camp where they got to handle some\nmilitary equipment and weapons.\n\n\nDr Lee said that other Accord contributions over the years included\nsuggestions to make the dial-a-date system, for the booking of fitness test\ndates for reservists, simpler and more user-friendly.\n\n\nMore recently, Accord members were briefed on the mandatory\nrequirement for reservists to inform Mindef of their overseas travel if it is\nlonger than 24 hours.\n\n\nDr Lee said that suggestions from the council to put up notices along\nthe way to the Causeway and to install toll-free lines at the airport for\nreservists to make last-minute calls to the Mindef Notification Centre are\nnow being considered for implementation.\n\n\n Who\'s who in Accord \n\n\n New members: \n\n\nMr Mohamad Maidin, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\nInformation and the Arts Mrs Lee Phui Mun, principal, Victoria Junior\nCollege;

On\nthe proposed exchange of sites for conservation, the society said six of 18\nsites demarcated as nature areas were public parks with little flora or\nfauna, while another site, which forms a substantial part of the total area,\nwas actually the Singapore Armed Forces\' live-firing area.\n\n\nThe society proposed that four other sites be conserved instead: *\nSENOKO: It consists of the mangrove, palm forest and ponds on either side of\nSungei Sembawang.\n\n\nThe area is the richest bird site in Singapore in terms of species\nand numbers.\n\n\nFound here are 189 species or 57 per cent of the total number of\nspecies recorded in Singapore, including internationally endangered birds\nlike the Chinese Egret and the Asian Dowitcher.\n\n\n* KHATIB BONGSU: The coastal wetland site off Yishun is home to 150\ndifferent species of birds, including several species of Herons.\n\n\nIn the migratory season, up to 10,000 birds feed and nest at the\nsite.\n\n\n* PUNGGOL GRASSLAND: The 50-ha site is the only substantial grassland\nhabitat in Singapore.\n\n\nAlthough an HDB estate is planned for the area, the NSS hopes that\nthe site could be built into the estate as a nature park, complete with\ntrails.\n\n\n* BATU PUTEH TERNERY: The rocky islet off the northern Changi coast\nis the nesting site of the Black-naped Tern, featured in Singapore\'s\n&dollar;1 note.\n\n\nThe NSS also suggested that once the nature areas are finalised, they\nshould be legislated as such to ensure their protection.\n\n\nIn addition, the society said that a coordinating body, consisting of\nrepresentatives from tertiary institutions, the NSS and other organisations,\nshould be formed to assist the National Parks Board in the management of\nnature areas.\n\n\nThe NSS feedback, together with other suggestions raised during\npublic forums and discussions with interest groups, will be considered by the\nrespective work groups over the next two months before the final Green Plan\nis released in September.\n\n\n Dispute over trade in endangered wildlife   \'Banned\' birds\nnot imported illegally: PPD \n\n\nReport by Dominic Nathan\n\n\nTHE " resident" songbird of housing estate bird shows, the\nMata-Puteh, is not being smuggled in from Malaysia.\n\n\nNeither is the Red-whiskered Bulbul being brought in illegally from\nThailand.\n\n\nThe Primary Production Department has refuted allegations, by the\nNational Council on the Environment ( NCE), that the birds were being sold\nhere despite being banned for export in their countries of origin.\n\n\nThe birds are available throughout the region, maintained the PPD.\n\n\nThe PPD spokesman also said that the birds are imported here legally\nas they are not listed as protected species under Cites, the international\nconvention on wildlife trade.\n\n\nThis is the latest development in the dispute between the PPD and the\nNCE over Singapore\'s alleged role as a transhipment centre in the illegal\ntrade of endangered species.\n\n\nThe controversy enters its second week as the PPD has challenged\nevidence of illegal wildlife trade here, provided by Mr Robert Kwan, the\nNCE\'s chairman, to The Sunday Times last week.\n\n\nIn the June 6 report, Mr Kwan maintained that although Malaysia has\nbanned the export of the Mata-Puteh and Thailand, the Red-Whiskered Bulbul,\nboth birds can be found in shops here.\n\n\nHe said that a survey of 46 bird shops here last year and this year\nfound at least 150 species of Indonesian birds being traded here, although\nIndonesia listed only 46 species as being approved for export.\n\n\nMr Kwan\'s evidence came from the international wildlife monitoring\nagency, Traffic Southeast Asia, based in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\nIn reply, the PPD said that Mr Kwan had failed to substantiate his\nstatement about Singapore\'s role in the illegal trade.\n\n\nSaid its spokesman: " However, he now implies that by the presence of \'protected\nbirds\' in Singapore, they are illegally imported, and such imports are\ntolerated by the Singapore authorities.\n\n\n" This is not true and needs clarification.\n\n\n" He explained that if a country wishes to stop the trade in its\nbirds, it should list it under the Convention on International Trade in\nEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.\n\n\nHe pointed out that the two birds in question are not listed by any\ncountry.\n\n\nIn addition, they are native to many countries in this part of the\nworld, such as Burma, India, China and Vietnam, aside from Malaysia and\nThailand.\n\n\nAll of these countries also export their birds to Singapore, he said.\n\n\nMr Kwan\'s assumption that the birds are either smuggled in or allowed\nin by PPD, in contravention of Cites, is therefore not true.\n\n\nHe noted that the convention, which Singapore signed in 1986, only\nregulates trade in endangered wildlife, and does not ban the trade of\nprotected birds.\n\n\nProtected birds under Cites fall under three groups: \n\n\nAppendix I: Birds listed here are absolutely not allowed to be\ntraded unless under special conditions, like for zoos and research.\n\n\nAppendix II: Birds here are protected, but international trade is\nallowed, subject to the convention rules.\n\n\nAppendix Birds listed by certain countries which seek the\nco-operation of other countries to prevent or restrict their export.\n\n\nThe Singapore Avicultural Society also commented on Traffic\nSoutheast Asia\'s findings. \n\n\nA society spokesman said that the protected birds found in local bird\nshops included several species of soft-billed birds, which are not given any\ninternational protection at all.\n\n\nIn addition, some of the protected birds may have been imported\nbefore Singapore signed Cites in 1986.\n\n\nSince the Cites export quotas are updated annually, the Traffic\nchecks carried out at bird shops may have included birds allowed into\nSingapore under earlier quotas, he added.\n\n\nAs for the NCE chairman\'s comments on the need to introduce wider\nlaws and plug existing legal loopholes to prevent protected species from\nbeing traded here, the PPD said: " Mr Robert Kwan is requesting Singapore to\ngo beyond the requirements of Cites.  \n\n\n" This is different from implying that Singapore is not following\nthe convention, and is a centre for illegal trade in wildlife."  \n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES, THURSDAY, JUNE 17, 1993\n\n\n HOME   Malaria danger over, but dengue threat is rising\n\n\n\nNumber of breeding sites has risen in last 3 months\n\n\nBy Dominic Nathan\n\n\nMALARIA has been overcome, but now dengue fever is threatening to\nbreak out across the island.\n\n\nThe number of breeding sites has gone up over the last three months\nsignalling a potential new outbreak.\n\n\nThe number of homes found breeding the Aedes mosquito went up to 953\nlast month, from 817 in April and 626 in March.\n\n\nDengue fever is spread by the Aedes mosquito.\n\n\nIn fact, the Aedes mosquito was found breeding in 48 per cent of\noutdoor sites checked last month.\n\n\nIn March it was found in only 8 per cent of sites checked and in\nApril, 9 per cent.\n\n\nThe increasing incidence of Aedes breeding sites comes barely a week\nafter the Environment Ministry declared the malaria outbreak at Punggol over.\n\n\nMore than 20 people were infected between late April and mid-May.\n\n\nOn the dengue situation, an ENV spokesman said that the recent rainy\nspell had resulted in water collecting in receptacles, both discarded and\nthose stored outdoors. \n\n\nPlastic and canvas sheets, defective roof gutters and blocked\ndrains are also common breeding sites.\n\n\nThe spokesman added: " The public is reminded to be extra vigilant\nin preventing mosquito breeding in their homes during this rainy period." The\nnumber of cases of dengue fever still remains low.\n\n\nThere were 10 isolated cases reported last week, a dramatic drop\ncompared with the 140 cases a week in July last year, at the peak of the\nthree-year outbreak.\n\n\nThis claimed 15 lives and afflicted nearly 7,000 people.\n\n\nIt is an offence to breed mosquitoes.\n\n\nFirst offenders can be fined S50.\n\n\nThe fine is\n&dollar;100 for a subsequent offence.\n\n\nRepeat offenders are taken to court.\n\n\nThe spokesman also suggested the following anti-mosquito measures:\n\n\n* CHANGE the water in flower vases and plant bowls every two days\nand scrub the interior of the vessels to remove mosquito eggs;\n\n\nAVOID using flower pot plates.\n\n\nIf they are used, empty the plates every two days.\n\n\nMAKE sure pails, basins and watering cans do not collect rain\nwater.\n\n\nCLEAR the grounds of any unwanted containers that can collect rain\nwater.\n\n\nREPAIR or remove defective roof gutters and keep them clear of\nleaves sand and silt.\n\n\nCLEAR leaves from drains and use non-perforated gully traps; and\nFILL up tree holes with cement.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ccfead05-5bab-4cba-abc8-5572e3048464', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.794073+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9556372165679932, 'non_english_score': 0.044362783432006836}
{'text': 'Lawlessness and insecurity pervade many parts of Cambodia with\nfrequent clashes between Khmer Rouge and Phnom Penh regime soldiers.\n\n\nOur Bangkok correspondent,TAN LIAN CHOO, who was in Cambodia recently,\nlooks at how residents of Stoung in Kampong Thom Province and UN peacekeepers\nare coping.\n\n\nKhmer Rouge and govt troops bane of key Cambodian town STOUNG (\nKampong Thom Province) - In the day armed soldiers strut about arrogantly\nwith their AK47 machineguns slung casually over their shoulders.\n\n\nBy nightfall, these soldiers belonging to the Phnom Penh regime are\noften drunk and shooting randomly.\n\n\nHere, in the heart of one of Cambodia\'s most contested territories,\narmed clashes between Khmer Rouge fighters and the state of Cambodia\'s forces\nare a way of life.\n\n\nGunfire is often heard throughout the night and residents stay behind\nlocked doors after 7 pm.\n\n\nThis no longer disturbs Stoung district\'s nearly 80,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n" But we head for our bunkers when the fighting gets heavy and if\nthere\'s shelling from mortar fire," said a 49-year-old woman, Pon.\n\n\nShe has three small children.\n\n\nTogether they mind a shop selling canned soft drinks and beer.\n\n\nThey also grow rice, like all their fellow villagers, and try to make\nends meet.\n\n\nHer survival instincts intact, Ms Pon advised me before she retired\nbehind her locked door: " If you hear a knock on your door in the middle of\nthe night, do not open it!" .\n\n\n- On March 5, Khmer Rouge fighters approached Stoung from several\ndirections.\n\n\nThere had been heavy shelling for six hours before the Khmer Rouge\nentered the town, occupied it for about two hours, ransacking and looting\nseveral houses.\n\n\nThe offices of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia\n( Untac) were not spared either.\n\n\nIts civilian police and electoral office in Stoung was ransacked.\n\n\nUntac personnel had earlier retreated to the bunkers in the\nIndonesian peacekeeping battalion compound for safety.\n\n\nThere was no counter-attack by Phnom Penh troops, which had retreated\nwithout any resistance.\n\n\nStoung had no defences and even though Khmer Rouge fighters left the\ntown after the attack, thousands of residents fled to the provincial capital\nabout 48 km away.\n\n\nShops remained closed for a week and many fleeing families do not\nreturn.\n\n\nWe estimate that about 20 per cent of Stoung\'s population left and\nhave not returned because they are too scared," said Lieutenant-Colonel Mark\nWalton, head of the UN military observer team in Stoung.\n\n\n\'I suspect the intention of the Khmer Rouge was not to dislodge the\ntroops of the Cambodian Peoples Armed Forces ( CPAF) but just to let people\nknow that they are still around in the area and can attack anytime," he said.\n\n\nLt-Col Walton, a Briton, was one of the first UN peacekeepers to be\nheld hostage by the Khmer Rouge last December.\n\n\nHe was freed unharmed after being detained with five other\npeacekeepers for nearly a week.\n\n\nHe noted that the situation in Stoung was very tense.\n\n\nOn the UNTAC military map, it remains marked as a CPAF stronghold.\n\n\nBut UN peacekeepers know that Khmer Rouge bases may be merely 5 km\naway.\n\n\n\'In the best of times, the whole area can be described as \'unstable\'.\n\n\nThere is a lot of military activity and shelling or random shooting\ncan take place anytime," he said.\n\n\nCompounding the already tense situation is the problem of\nundisciplined CPAF troops, often loafing around and firing their weapons to\nresolve any personal disputes.\n\n\nEarlier this month, a group of CPAF soldiers went to the Stoung\nmarket.\n\n\nTraders here refused their 50-riel notes, the smallest local currency\ndenomination officially in circulation.\n\n\nThe angry soldiers opened fire above the heads of traders, emptying\nseveral rounds of ammunition.\n\n\nEveryone fled.\n\n\n" The CPAF soldiers are frightening people with their undisciplined\nways," Lt-Col Walton said.\n\n\nThese drunken soldiers are often unruly, demanding cigarettes from\npassers-by, and clearly desperate for money.\n\n\nMost of them have not been paid for months.\n\n\nIn contrast, Khmer Rouge soldiers are well-disciplined.\n\n\nUN military observers said their weapons were always well-maintained\nand the men were not distracted by drinking.\n\n\n" But people here are still very frightened of the Khmer Rouge," said\nLt-Col Walton.\n\n\n" This comes across all the time".\n\n\n" Many people say they have buried their voter-registration cards\nbecause they fear being caught by the Khmer Rouge with their cards".\n\n\nSuch fears among residents, largely illiterate and mostly very poor,\nare not unfounded.\n\n\nAt the Stoung district hospital, where security cannot be guaranteed,\nonly eight patients have dared to be warded.\n\n\nThe walls of the hospital are still pock-marked with holes from\nmachine-gun attacks, the worst of which took place in 1991.\n\n\nCambodians living in these parts have frequently fled their native\nvillages whenever fighting flares up.\n\n\nThey are not known to have ideological allegiances and often flee in\nthe direction of retreating forces, be they Khmer Rouge or troops loyal to\nPhnom Penh.\n\n\nOver the years, Stoung\'s fleeing inhabitants have joined Cambodia\'s\nswelling internally displaced population which now totals 160,000.\n\n\nIn the Stoung district alone, more than 1,150 families are currently\ncamping temporarily by Route 6, the main Kampong Thom-Stoung trunk road after\nfleeing recent fighting.\n\n\nThey have been there for the last three months.\n\n\nThese families, which relief officials said amounted to more than\n5,000 people, are sleeping under blue plastic sheets.\n\n\nThey have not been able to return to their homes in villages situated\n15 km north of the road, now under Khmer Rouge control and recently re-mined\nby the guerillas.\n\n\nThe Kampong Thom-Stoung road itself is also laid with mines.\n\n\nAnti-personnel mines are laid every night and removed in the mornings\nby CPAF troops.\n\n\nAll Untac and international relief officials have been warned not to\ntravel on these roads too early or too late in the day.\n\n\nStanding safety instructions include avoiding being the first car on\nthis road on any day.\n\n\nDespite such widespread insecurity and lawlessness, Untac officials\nare hopeful that elections can still take place in May.\n\n\nBut so far, UN peacekeepers said, security could be assured for only\nfive out of 13 planned polling stations. \n\n\n\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES, TUESDAY, MARCH 30, 1993\n\n\n Practice of human rights will vary among countries: Chuan \n\n\n Superiority of norms in more-developed countries a misconceived\nidea, says Premier \n\n\nby Tan Lian Choo\n\n\nBangkok correspondent\n\n\nBANGKOK_There can only be one set of fundamental human rights for\nwhatever part of the world but approaches to implement these rights must\nnecessarily vary from country to country, according to Prime Minister Chuan\nLeekpai.\n\n\nOpening a five-day regional conference on human rights here\nyesterday, Mr Chuan said: " Perception of rights does not exist in pure air.\n\n\nIt is a result of complex inter-actions among several groups in the\nsociety.\n\n\n" Therefore, it is natural that approaches to the implementation of\nfundamental human rights vary because of differences in socio-economic,\nhistorical, cultural backgrounds and conditions.\n\n\nThe promotion of human rights would be more effective if there is a\nclear understanding and recognition of such differences.\n\n\n" Changes to human rights must emerge primarily from within and not\nimposed from outside.\n\n\nHuman rights should also evolve at their own pace if they are to be\npeaceful and sustainable.\n\n\n" Mr Chuan, implicitly responding to criticism by Western countries,\nalso said it was a " misconceived idea" that human-rights norms in more-\neconomically-developed countries were superior to those in less-developed\nones.\n\n\nForeign Minister Prasong Soonsiri called for an adjustment of\nattitude and methods to improve the existing approach which, he said, often\nled to " suspicion and mistrust because of the self-righteous and censorious\nattitude usually adopted by the stronger and more developed countries against\nthe weaker, developing countries".\n\n\nThe Asia-Pacific regional meeting is a preparatory session for the\nWorld Conference On Human Rights, to be held from June 14 to 25 in Vienna and\nseeks to boost the United Nations\' role in addressing human-rights violations\nin member-countries.\n\n\nThe 49 participating countries here, including Singapore, will draft\nthe Asia-Pacific groups collective position on human rights.\n\n\nMr Chuan, who took over last September as Thailand\'s first elected\nPremier, after the Thai military brutally suppressed unarmed pro-democracy\nprotesters in May, also called for more democratisation.\n\n\n" The Inherent inter-relationship between human rights, democracy and\ndevelopment has become clearly visible.\n\n\nThe need to keep a fair balance between those fundamental components\nbecomes even more urgent.\n\n\nThis is particularly so in a time of greater political and economic\nuncertainties in our world today," he said.\n\n\nHe said Asia could play a more prominent role on the world stage if\nit ensured that its peoples were provided with their rights and freedoms as\nset forth in the United Nations\' Charter and the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights.\n\n\nThe UN Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Mr Ibrahima\nFall, told the conference that in spite of " undeniable progress" in\ncombating human-rights abuses, much more could be done to make the\nimplementation of human-rights norms more effective.\n\n\nSeveral non-government human-rights organisatians, including the\nLondon-based Amnesty International, are campaigning actively at the Bangkok\nmeeting.\n\n\n Fears that transfer of power may be thwarted \n\n\n Funcinpec set to be declared winner \n\n\nBy Tan Lian Choo in Phnom Penh\n\n\nPHNOM PENH_The royalist Funcinpec party yesterday emerged as the\nvirtual overall winner in last week\'s United Nations-run elections after 90\nper cent of the votes were counted, raising fears that extremist elements in\nthe Phnom Penh regime may resist a transfer of power.\n\n\nHead of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk immediately stepped in as a\nmediator, asking the leaders of Funcinpec and the regime\'s Cambodian People\'s\nParty ( CPP) to meet him over lunch.\n\n\nPolitical sources said he was considering a proposal by CPP strongman\nChea Sim that the Prince become the Prime Minister.\n\n\nUnder this plan, the CPP and Funcinpec leaders will be Vice-Premiers\nin a coalition government.\n\n\nHowever, Funcinpec head Prince Norodom Ranariddh, currently in the\nnorth-western Banteay Meanchey province, is said to be cool to the idea.\n\n\n" There\'s a groping behind the scenes for some kind of acceptable\nformula for power-sharing," said Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia ( Untac).\n\n\nHe told The Straits Times in an interview yesterday that Prince\nSihanouk was " very active".\n\n\nAccording to Untac, Funcinpec had won 5.7 per cent of votes counted\nso far, while the CPP, political arm of the Vietnamese-installed government,\nsecured 38.1 per cent.\n\n\nUntac said that nearly 3.4 million of the 4.2 million votes had been\ncounted up to yesterday.\n\n\nThe counting of the rest of the votes is expected to be completed\ntoday.\n\n\nElectoral pundits predict that Funcinpec would emerge with the most\nseats and may even secure a simple majority in the 12-member Constituent\nAssembly.\n\n\nThe CPP would be the second largest party with about 55 seats, but it\nthreatened on Tuesday to reject the results unless fresh polling was held in\nfour provinces.\n\n\nUntac election experts said complaints by the CPP about "\nirregularities" in balloting were " normal" but they did not merit a new\nvote.\n\n\nSenior Funcinpec officials playing down their pending electoral\nvictory because of death threats, yesterday appealed to Untac not to give in\nto the \'blackmail" by Phnom Penh leaders.\n\n\nSaid Funcinpec spokesman Prince Norodom Sirivudh, a half-brother of\nPrince Sihanouk: " We are very worried.\n\n\nWe have to be prudent.\n\n\nWe have asked our representatives in remote areas to halt\ntemporarily their political activities.\n\n\nThe latest victims of post-polls violence directed at Funcinpec\nfollowers were a 57-year-old woman and her 23-year-old son.\n\n\nThey were killed by a group of 12 attackers using automatic rifles\nwhile they were in a Funcinpec office in the eastern Prey Veng province.\n\n\nFive other people were also wounded in that attack, which villagers\nalleged had been the work of State of Cambodia policemen.\n\n\nIn another violent incident in the central province of Kompong\nChhnang, two Funcinpec activists were said to have been decapitated and\ndisembowelled.\n\n\nOfficial Phnom Penh Radio yesterday announced ominously: " The\ncurrent situation is bad.\n\n\nWhatever the election results be, the authority in place will\nremain.\n\n\n" All laws must be enforced strictly.\n\n\nThe state of Cambodia and the CPP are trying to resolve the current\nbad situation. \n\n\nWe appeal to the people, the army and the police to stay calm.\n\n\nLet there not be chaos."

{'text': 'Companies sack staff who suffer from epileptic fits \n\n\n Dismissals reflect widespread ignorance of disease \n\n\nby Brendan Pereira\n\n\nTHREE jobs in two months - but Mr Lewis Williams is not a job-hopper.\n\n\nHis services have been terminated on each occasion by employers\nbecause he suffers from epilepsy, a condition where a person has recurrent\nseizures According to five neurologists interviewed by The Straits Times,\nsuch cases are not uncommon.\n\n\nIn some of them, the doctors have had to intervene on behalf of their\npatients and plead with employers not to sack them.\n\n\nThey said that this action reflects widespread ignorance about the\ndisease, which affects about 1 per cent of the population here.\n\n\nRelating his experience, Mr Williams, 36, said that every time he\nsuffered a seizure at his workplace, it spelt doom Two of his employers, a\nmultinational and a reputable company, told him that it was dangerous for him\nto continue his work as a technician.\n\n\nThe third company, where he worked as a storekeeper, felt that it was\n" very bad for business if customers witnessed him having an attack".\n\n\nHe said: " It was very frustrating because I only had the fits on a\nfew occasions when I was under stress or felt tired.\n\n\nMost of the time, I worked well".\n\n\nAt present, he is working in an office as a general worker.\n\n\nWhen contacted, a personnel officer of one of the companies said that\nit had to take such action because his safety could not be guaranteed if he\nsuffered a fit on the workfloor.\n\n\nIt was also disruptive to other workers.\n\n\nEpilepsy takes many forms.\n\n\nSome patients lose consciousness and are hit by convulsions, or\nappear dazed or confused.\n\n\nOthers have strange sensations in the stomach or limbs.\n\n\nThe disorder can be caused by many factors, including head injuries,\ntumours and brain infections.\n\n\nBut often, no cause can be found.\n\n\nNeurologists interviewed said they have come across such cases as Mr\nWilliams\'.\n\n\nDr Tang Kok Foo, a private practitioner, said that five of his\nepileptic patients lost their jobs.\n\n\nA similar situation was reported by Dr Michael Cbee, senior registrar\nat Tan Tock Seng Hospital\'s Department of Neurology.\n\n\nHe said: " It is sad when employers react this way because these\npeople are normal 99 per cent of the time.\n\n\nAnd even when they do suffer an epileptic attack, it is only for a\nfew seconds.\n\n\nAnother neurologist, who is in private practice, said that a number\nof his patients have lost their jobs.\n\n\nHe said: It is a question of employers being afraid of being held\nresponsible if any accident happens to someone suffering a seizure".\n\n\nThis fear could be overcome by making these employees sign a form,\nabsolving the company of any responsibility for injuries suffered during a\nfit he said.\n\n\nDoctors also said that ignorance about the disorder was another\nstumbling block.\n\n\nFor example, a survey in 1989 by a group of medical students showed\nthat 20 per cent of those interviewed felt that the disease was contagious.\n\n\nAnother 54 per cent thought that epileptics should stay at home.\n\n\nDon\'t put hard objects in mouth.\n\n\nDO NOT shove a spoon or other metal objects into the mouth of someone\nwho is suffering an epileptic seizure.\n\n\nIt will result in the person ending up with crooked teeth, or even\nworse, no teeth.\n\n\nDr Michael Chee, senior registrar at Tan Tock Seng Hospital\'s\nDepartment of Neurology, said: " People put something hard into the mouth of\nan epileptic person believing that it will prevent him from biting off his\ntongue.\n\n\nThis is a mistake.\n\n\nThe hard object may even be dangerous to the person".\n\n\nHe said that there was little danger of someone who is suffering from\na seizure biting off his tongue.\n\n\nIf the person bites his tongue really hard, the brain will send a\nsignal, pain will be registered and the patient will relax the grip, he said.\n\n\nHis advice to the public: let the seizure run its course.\n\n\nGive someone who is suffering from fits space and do not attempt to\nrestrain him.\n\n\nHe said: " He becomes aggressive if pinned down.\n\n\nGive him space and the attack will be over in a few seconds." But\nintervene if the epileptic person is having an attack near a busy road or in\nan area where he is likely to be in some danger.\n\n\nPrivate doctors urged to join forces to cut costs\n\n\nSMA feels pooling will help curb steep increases\n\n\nBy Brendan Pereira\n\n\nDOCTORS intending to enter private practice are being encouraged to\nform partnerships to cut overheads and put a lid on increases in health care\ncosts.\n\n\nAt the same time, the Singapore Medical Association ( SMA) is also\ngetting existing clinics run by sole practitioners to pool their resources\nand upgrade their practices.\n\n\nDr Tan Eok Soo, president of SMA, said that by pooling resources,\nclinics will be able to offer services such as blood and electrocardiogram (\nECG) tests for heart diseases.\n\n\nIn an interview with The Straits Times he said that primary health\ncare costs are likely to rise in the next few years, largely because of the\nhigh salary for staff and high rentals of shophouses and units.\n\n\nOne way to tackle this problem is by persuading doctors just\nbeginning their practices to form partnerships to share equipment, premises\nand staff to cut costs.\n\n\nA possible benefit from this move is that with starting up costs\nunder control, consumers will not face steep charges.\n\n\nDr Tan said: " I do not think it\'s possible to say that patients will\npay less if doctors practise economy of scale".\n\n\n" It is more likely that steep increases will be a thing of the past\nin primary health care".\n\n\nHe said that at present, the rental and purchase of Housing Board\nshop lots represents the biggest overhead cost for doctors.\n\n\nSome sole practitioners are paying as much as\n&dollar;7,O0O a month for rental in areas such as Simei and Yishun.\n\n\nOthers who buy their own units are paying astronomical amounts.\n\n\nIn fact, one doctor bought a unit in a popular area in Choa Chu Kang\nfor\n&dollar;1.2 million, Dr Tan said.\n\n\nHe said: " If doctors have to pay such large amounts, it is likely\nthat they will have to pass on some of the costs to consumers.\n\n\nThat is why SMA is trying to encourage doctors to join forces.\n\n\n" This will lessen the burden on themselves and also their\ncustomers".\n\n\nIt is learnt that doctors who pay higher rental are charging about\n&dollar;2 to\n&dollar;3 more for consultation than their counterparts in older estates.\n\n\nAt present, there are about 800 medical clinics in Singapore.\n\n\nIn addition to being cost-effective, partnerships also mean that\nclinics can stay open for longer hours and waiting time is reduced.\n\n\nAlso, with other doctors to share the patient load, a doctor can\nspend more time with each patient.\n\n\nA doctor in private practice for the last eight years agreed that\nforming partnerships has its advantages.\n\n\nHe said: " A second opinion is readily available within the same\npremises".\n\n\nAnother strategy by the SMA is to persuade existing one-doctor\nclinics to pool their resources and upgrade their practices.\n\n\nMore than 90 per cent of private clinics are run by sole\npractitioners.\n\n\nDr Tan said that at present, it is not viable for general\npractitioners to buy better medical equipment.\n\n\nBut this problem can be solved if doctors pooled their resources.\n\n\nFor example, two clinics within walking distance in an area such as\nBishan could team up and buy equipment which would complement each other.\n\n\nOne clinic could have an instant blood testing unit and another an\nECG machine.\n\n\nSaid Dr Tan: " With the emphasis now on primary health care and\nfamily doctors, I think the public\'s expectations of general practitioners\nwill go up.\n\n\n" This is one way in which we can keep pace with their expectations.\n\n\nInstead of going to specialists or to hospitals for these tests, they\ncan be done at the clinics".\n\n\nLicenses for pet birds?\n\n\nALL pet birds in Singapore homes are being kept illegally, if one\ninterprets local environmental laws strictly, said Mr Robert Kwan.\n\n\nMr Kwan, chairman of the National Council on the Environment, said\nthat under Singapore\'s Wild Animals and Birds Act, it is an offence to keep\nany bird without a licence.\n\n\nBut there are no provisions for the licensing of birds here.\n\n\nHe was referring to findings in a paper entitled Wildlife Protection\nLaws in Singapore by Associate Professor Lye Lin Heng from the National\nUniversity of Singapore\'s Law faculty.\n\n\nMr Kwan said that the licensing of birds, for example, would provide\nan important check on the legal trade.\n\n\nSmuggling a thing of the past: Bird dealers\' group ILLEGAL shipments\nof birds are a thing of the past, say the Bird Dealers\' Association here.\n\n\nAll traders are licensed by the Primary Production Department.\n\n\nEach separate import and export also requires a licence, said an\nassociation spokesman.\n\n\nIn response to an earlier statement by National Council on the\nEnvironment chairman Robert Kwan that Singapore was a major transhipment\ncentre for illegal trade in wildlife, the association said: Mr Kwan\'s\nstatement contained remarks that are misleading".\n\n\nThe spokesman added that the association was not aware of any traders\ninvolved in smuggling.\n\n\nHe said that traders have to produce supporting documents and all\nbirds are inspected by the PPD for import and export.\n\n\nHe added: " This procedure is carried out for all consignments, even\nthose which are shipped in the middle of the night.\n\n\nWith such control, illegal shipments are a thing of the past".\n\n\nBut he declined to answer a question on how some birds that are\nbanned for export in their countries of origin still find their way here.\n\n\nThe spokesman said: " Please refer to the PPD.\n\n\nThey are in a better position to answer this question".\n\n\nEarlier, Mr Kwan had also said: " In Singapore, we are promoting bird\nsinging contests.\n\n\nBut this is in conflict with wildlife conservation as some of the\nbirds trapped in the wild are on the endangered list.\n\n\nIn response, the spokesman said that keeping songbirds is very much\npart of Singapore\'s cultural heritage and that many of the birds are not\nendangered.\n\n\nBesides, some traders have also turned to captive breeding as an\nalternative source of supply of birds.\n\n\nHe said: " Proper breeding arms ensure a continuous supply of birds.\n\n\nCaptive breeding is recognised internationally as an important method\nof conserving endangered species".\n\n\nBudgerigars, cockatiels, rosellas, canaries and other bird species\nare now being bred in large numbers and have even replaced the demand for\nbirds caught in the wild.\n\n\nHe added that the association\'s members have also turned to breeding\nmore endangered species of parrots and other birds as part of their\nconservation efforts.\n\n\nCrowds yet to return to Punggol Point by Dominic Nathan PUNGGOL\nPaint has been declared malaria-free, but the crowds have not returned to the\nseafood restaurants and boatels in the area yet.\n\n\nBut businesses in the area, which now have the Sea Games and wet\nweather to contend with, expect things to pick up by the weekend.\n\n\nOn Saturday, the Environment Ministry announced that the malaria\noutbreak at Punggol Point had ended, and that the last five patients infected\nin the area had been treated and discharged.\n\n\n" Malaria, Keep Out" signs, which were put up at various points\nalong Punggol Road have also been removed.\n\n\nThings are beginning to return to normal slowly at Punggol Point,\nthe popular haunt of seafood lovers which was like a ghost town in the last\ntwo weeks, after the ministry advised members of the public to stay away.\n\n\nThe Marinaview Seafood Restaurant and Boatel reopened for business\nover the weekend after being closed for over a week.\n\n\nThe restaurant\'s manager who did not want to be named, said: " Now\nthat the area is safe again, people are slowly starting to come back.\n\n\nWe expect normal business by this weekend".\n\n\nOperators of the other seafood restaurants at Punggol Point also\nsaid that business was picking up slowly. \n\n\nOn Sunday, it improved further.\n\n\nThe turnout was between 30 and 40 per cent of what it used to be.\n\n\nBut yesterday\'s heavy downpour put a damper on business again.\n\n\nA helper at one of the restaurants, Mr T H Tan, 34, said: " At\nfirst, they were scared of malaria, and now, everyone is at home watching the\nSea Garnes.\n\n\n" But by next week, it should be okay".\n\n\nThe only site still closed is the People\'s Association Punggol\nPoint Sea Sports Club.\n\n\nOfficials at the PA said that they had no instructions to reopen\nthe club, which is usually heavily-booked during the June school holidays.\n\n\nAlthough the outbreak of the disease has ended, ENV said that it\nwould continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance over the disease and\nmosquito situation.\n\n\nActive case detection, mass blood surveys and " search and destroy"\noperations for the malaria-spreading Anopheles mosquito will continue.\n\n\nSo far this year, the total malaria count stands at 120 cases,\nincluding 94 imported cases ( victims who were infected overseas).\n\n\nAmong the few patrons at the Marina Seafood Restaurant last night\nwas Mr Richard Tan, 32, and his colleagues He said: " We saw the newspaper\nreport about the area being safe, so we decided to come here for a meal.\n\n\n" We were hoping to get a discount on the seafood because I am sure\nbusiness has been bad for the restaurant.\n\n\nUnfortunately for them, some things, such as the prices, have not\nchanged at Punggol\'s restaurants, low turnout or not.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd002662c-0d42-4bae-8ad1-40e65da2d23d', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.796455+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': 'It\'s Job Week, so give us work, not money: Scouts \n\n\nBy Geraldine Kan\n\n\nWHEN Paul Cheak went knocking on doors last year during the Boy\nScouts\' annual Job Week, half the households he approached gave him money\nwithout asking him to do any work.\n\n\nA scout\'s dream come true?\n\n\nHardly.\n\n\nPaul and his friends would rather work for their money .\n\n\nBut many Singaporeans with busy schedules and hired help have no time\nto supervise the scouts who come knocking on their doors.\n\n\nOthers say they cannot find odd jobs at a moment\'s notice.\n\n\nThat is not good news to the scouts.\n\n\nSaid Chua I-Min, 17: " It\'s more meaningful for us to work - it\'s\ncalled Job Week, not Donation Week." I-Min, Paul and eight other scouts spent\nyesterday morning at the Istana, sweeping, polishing and cleaning to launch\nJob Week.\n\n\nFrom today till Sunday, ll,000 scouts carrying pledge cards will ring\ndoor-bells and look for work.\n\n\nLast year, they raised\n&dollar;280,000. \n\n\nThis year, their target is\n&dollar;350,000. \n\n\nMr Peter Joe Chia, Financial Resources Commissioner of the\nSingapore Scout Association, said: " I know people are busy, but they can\nstill get the boys to do jobs like sweeping the floor.\n\n\n" The point is to teach them that honest work is worth emulating and\nthat there is honour in labour - yes, money is important, but that\'s not the\nbe-all and end-all of the job." Some people mean well when they send the\nscouts away with a few dollars.\n\n\nSaid Ms Wee Lee Fung, an accountant in her 30s: " I already have a\nmaid who does the housework, so I just give the scouts a bit of money.\n\n\nThis way they won\'t feel discouraged."\n\n\nSome people feel the scouts cannot do a thorough enough job without\nsupervision - and to sit and direct them would be too inconvenient.\n\n\nSeveral companies feel that theirs would be the wrong place to do odd\njobs - factories, for example, could be dangerous, while others say their\nstaff do everything.\n\n\nFor example, Ms Dinger Leong, assistant manager of advertising and\npublic relations at the Holiday Inn Parkview, said that there are no jobs\navailable for such a short time frame.\n\n\nEven jobs such as cleaning are done on a set schedule and are handled\nby trained staff.\n\n\nHowever, Mr Albert Toh, general manager of the Hard Rock Cafe, feels\nthat work can always be found.\n\n\nThe boys he said, could do odd jobs such as mending and cleaning\nfurniture, with some staff supervision.\n\n\nHe would then get his staff to pitch in and pay the scouts.\n\n\nMoney is not all that the boys get - they also do work they would not\ndo otherwise and learn to negotiate and deal with rejection.\n\n\nPaul, for instance, has worked as a baby-sitter, cleaned tennis\ncourts and polished cars.\n\n\nAt home, his housework is confined to washing dishes.\n\n\nPersuasive skills are also honed.\n\n\nSaid I - Min: " Sometimes, people get quite hostile - but you just keep\ncalm and explain your purpose." Some have picked up a tip or two on where to\nget work.\n\n\nZhuang Tian Wei, 18, for instance, knows that jobs come easier at\nhousing estates rather than affluent neighbourhoods with landed property - -\nthe latter are more likely to have maids, he explained.\n\n\nPresident Wee Kim Wee, who offered cakes and drinks to the 10 scouts\nwho spent the morning sprucing up the Istana, said: " It helps for the boys\nto know they can raise money with their own hands." \n\n\n\n\n S\'pore to hold first major art fair in September  \nOriginal works by Picasso and Salvador Dali to be featured \n\n\nBy Geraldine Kan\n\n\nSINGAPORE\'S first major art fair, to be held in September, will\nfeature more than US&dollar;50 million ( S&dollar;80 million) worth of art for sale under\none roof - including original works by Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Salvador\nDali and David Hockney.\n\n\nCalled Tresors 1993, the exhibition, to be held at the World Trade\nCentre from Sept 29 to Oct 3, will be the first on such a large scale in the\nregion.\n\n\nIt will bring together 100 of the world\'s leading dealers from\nEurope, North America and Asia.\n\n\nMr William Burris, president of Bradbury Ltd, the UK-based company\nmanaging the fair, said: " Tresors\' ambition is to establish the Singapore\nfair as one of the five great international ones within five years so that\nthe top fine art and antique dealers and galleries will have a major fair in\nthe largest potential market in the world." The event, which will be open to\nthe public, targets buyers from Hongkong, Taiwan and Malaysia as well as\nother countries in the region.\n\n\nIt will be an annual event for the next few years.\n\n\nApart from Singapore\'s location and the region\'s projected growth, Mr\nBurris also cited government support for the arts as a reason the company\npicked the Republic as the venue over other contenders like Seoul and\nHongkong.\n\n\nHe said he sees Singapore as the ideal place for Tresors because of\nits potential, despite its fledgling art scene.\n\n\n" You can only put so much water in a glass.\n\n\nIn a country like Hongkong, the glass is full.\n\n\nBut in Singapore and South-east Asia, no one knows how big the glass\nis or how much water there is in it."\n\n\nHe said although European and American art dealers had been eyeing\nAsian buyers, they had only been using Hongkong and Japan as a base.\n\n\nThe fair, he said, will be a way for dealers to reach buyers in this\nregion.\n\n\nSaid Mr Yeo Seng Teck, the chief executive officer of the Trade\nDevelopment Board ( TDB) and chairman of the Empress Place Museum:\n\n\n" It will give a boost to the Singapore arts scene - both artists and\nthe public will be exposed to some of the best works in the world.\n\n\n" The Government regards this fair as an important pioneering event\nin our efforts to promote Singapore as an international arts centre, not only\nfor the development of arts and culture, but also as an important new\neconomic activity."\n\n\nAt a briefing yesterday, dealers from cities including New York,\nParis and Zurich previewed about a dozen pieces that will be shown at the\nexhibition.\n\n\nThese include Picasso\'s Bearded Man, Chagall\'s Clown on a White Horse\nand Hockney\'s Seascape.\n\n\nThe event is supported by the TDB, Empress Place Museum and the\nEconomic Development Board, which is helping with the logistics.\n\n\nMs Sarina Tang, an art consultant with Sarina Tang Fine Arts in New\nYork, said she is attending the exhibition because the region is on the verge\nof putting much more emphasis on the arts and also because of Singapore\'s\nlink to the East and West.\n\n\n" Once countries achieve a certain amount of economic success, they\nturn to finer things," said Ms Tang, who brought in Hockney\'s Seascape, which\nis worth about US&dollar;225,000.\n\n\nIn September, she will bring in works by artists such as Jackson\nPollock, Fernando Botero and Willem de Kooning.\n\n\nA\n&dollar;10,000 PRIZE for the best original local artwork is being offered in\nconjunctlon wlth the art exhibition Tresors.\n\n\nThe multi-media competition, which is open to all professional\nartists living in Singapore, is divided into two groups: painting and three\ndimensional art.\n\n\nThe two top works in each category of the Philip Morris Group of\nCompanies Singapore Art Awards 1993 will be shown at the Roy Miles Gallery in\nLondon.\n\n\nThe panel of local and foreign judges include Mr Ng Eng Teng, Thomas\nYeo, both local artists, as well as Mr Roy Miles, owner of the London gallery\nin which the winning entries will be put on display.\n\n\nThe top five entries in the painting category and the top three in\nthree-dimensional art will receive cash awards amounting to\n&dollar;43,000. \n\n\nAll winning entries will also be exhibited at the Philip\nMorris Group of Companies Pavilion at Tresors. \n\n\n\n\n More singles over 35 seeking help from matchmaking agencies \n\n\nBut people are urged to be realistic about their future Spouses\n\n\nBy Geraldine Kan\n\n\nMORE men and women over 35 years old are turning to matchmaking\nagencies to help find a partner, but traditional expectations of spouses are\nstill hampering a successful match.\n\n\nMatchmakers say women still prefer men their age or slightly older.\n\n\nThe men must also match their educational and financial status.\n\n\nMen are less fussy about a woman\'s status, but they are still choosy\nabout her looks and age.\n\n\nDates have to be about five years younger.\n\n\nMatchmaking agencies have had to resort to counselling to persuade\nboth men and women to be more realistic - and even to advertising for older\nmen.\n\n\nThe government matchmakers, the Social Development Unit ( SDU) and\nSocial Development Section ( SDS), have reported a near-doubling in the\nnumber of singles over 35 joining them since 1990.\n\n\nAt the same time, private matchmaking agencies have reported a\none-third increase in the number of singles registered with them.\n\n\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said that the proportion of\nunmarried women above 35 years old had increased between 1980 and 1990.\n\n\nIf not corrected, he said the trend would weaken family building\nblocks.\n\n\nHe also said that there was a growing number of single men.\n\n\nBut while most single women had secondary and post-secondary\nqualifications, single men mostly did not have secondary school education.\n\n\nThe SDU and SDS have also seen the number of older members rise\nfaster than those of other age groups.\n\n\n" Both sides are looking for spouses, but perhaps they are\nconcentrating on careers first," said Dr Ang Wai Hoong, SDU\'s director.\n\n\nMrs Jean Lim, head of SDS, said that it has several activities every\nmonth, ranging from talks to outdoor trips, open only to those over 30.\n\n\nShe added that there are more marriages every year since 1990,\nalthough there are no figures on the rates between the different age groups.\n\n\nSome private agencies have even resorted to advertising for potential\nmates to meet their clients\' needs.\n\n\nMr Horatio Lee, manager of the 1-year-old Goodluck Friends Centre,\ntargets car owners, leaving brochures under their windscreen wipers to draw\naffluent, older single men to meet the demands of older single women.\n\n\nThe matchmakers\' persuasive powers - getting clients to lower their\nexpectations - are also being tested.\n\n\nMrs K.\n\n\nSaroja, a consultant with Introducer, said that some of her male\nclients are becoming status conscious when looking for a spouse, though men\nin general are not as concerned about status as women.\n\n\nShe also noted that grooming and manners have become more important\nto both sexes, as well as how partners spend their free time.\n\n\nGenerally, they prefer someone who likes outdoor activities such as\nracquet games and cycling, or who share their own leisure activities.\n\n\nMs Angela Raju of matchmaking agency Icebreakers said: " I foresee my\njob becoming more and more difficult.\n\n\nIf neither side wants to change their thinking, it will be harder for\nus to find someone for them." \n\n\n\n\n Win Olympic medal, PM challenges sailors \n\n\nBy Tay Cheng Khoon\n\n\nPrime Minister Goh Chok Tong has thrown a challenge to Singapore\'s\nyachting fraternity:\n\n\nWin a medal at the 2008 Olympic Games.\n\n\nSpeaking at the official opening of the National Sailing Centre at\nthe East Coast Parkway yesterday, he said that Singapore\'s sportsmen should\naim not only for regional recognition, but also strive to be world beaters.\n\n\n" I therefore want to throw out a challenge to you.\n\n\nWin an Olympic medal for Singapore at the 2008 Games. \'\n\n\n" This is an ambitious goal, he admitted, but one within reach."\n\n\nThen, to the applause of the 400-strong audience, he added:\n\n\n" You can be the little giant who succeeds in an Olympian task."\n\n\nHe then praised the Republic\'s sailors who, in recent years, have\nperformed well in various regional and international competitions.\n\n\n" More importantly, their discipline, commitment and spirit of\nsacrifice have been exemplary.\n\n\n" You need more athletes like them to keep the Singapore flag flying\nhigh in international competitions."\n\n\nSuch successes, he said, help nation-building.\n\n\nSports can entertain,excite, bond the people and bind a nation. \n\n\nEarlier on, he disclosed that the Singapore Sports Council is keen\non making sailing as popular as swimming.\n\n\nThis, he said, makes a lot of sense.\n\n\n" We are an island-state surrounded by the sea.\n\n\nSailing is a sport that all Singaporeans can enjoy."\n\n\n" It helps develop self-discipline and mental and physical\nstamina."\n\n\n" It brings us closer to the great outdoors and helps us to better\nappreciate our environment."\n\n\nHe would encourage more schools, community centres and clubs to\ninclude sailing in their activities.\n\n\nMr Goh, a keen golfer and tennis player, later told The Sunday\nTimes that he " never had a chance" to try sailing, although he lived near\nthe sea when he was young.\n\n\nIt was just swimming and " rowing the sampans."\n\n\nThe 2.4-hectare National Sailing Centre costs\n&dollar;8 million.\n\n\nIt caters for all classes of sailors -

{'text': 'Pre-U Seminar \n\n\n Asian countries \'showing more boldness at forums\' \n\n\nBy Chiang Yin Pheng\n\n\nASIAN nations are now " talking back" to the West and expressing their\nworld views with greater confidence at international forums, said Professor\nChan Heng Chee yesterday.\n\n\nTheir newly-felt presence at conferences, such as the current one on\nhuman rights in Vienna springs from the confidence of having robust\neconomies.\n\n\n" Going with the economic power is that sense of Asian pride that has\nAsian countries telling Western ones: \'Look, I am going to have a dialogue\nwith you, " she said.\n\n\nWorld forums are therefore seeing more evenly-matched debates between\nWestern and Third World nations, said the head of the Singapore International\nFoundation and the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies.\n\n\nShe made these observations while fielding questions from students at\nthe Pre-University Seminar, held at the National University of Singapore.\n\n\nAsked whether the economic power and influence of Asia would\novershadow that of the Western powers, she said that the issue had to he seen\nin perspective.\n\n\nWhile Western nations were in a general state of recession, they were\ncertainly " not in a state of rot".\n\n\nGermany, for example, was expected to bounce back from its\nunification problems in five years or so; and although America was in a\nslump, its store of creativity, capital and energy would pull it through, she\nsaid.\n\n\nFor now, however, Asian economies were picking up economic strength -\nand the confidence to tell Western nations, at the human rights conference in\nVienna for example, that the rights to safe homes and good jobs were more\nvital than the right to free elections.\n\n\nIn her speech earlier, she urged her young audience to look outwards\nand deepen their knowledge of the region.\n\n\nIt was not enough for them to know the hard facts about these\ncountries, she said.\n\n\nThey should also know the " soft-ware" - the language and the\nculture - to be able to function abroad.\n\n\nDuring question time, 24 students raised issues, ranging from\nbusiness opportunities in Russia to the devaluation of the Chinese renminbi.\n\n\nSeveral posed specific scenarios and asked how they could affect\nSingapore\'s go-regional drive.\n\n\nSuch was the diversity of questions that Prof Chan remarked later: "\nWhen I accepted the invitation to speak on \'Looking beyond Singapore\', I\ndidn\'t think that I would be discussing every country under the sun." To a\nquestion on the Cambodian election results, she said if order could reign,\nSingapore and other businessmen would do well there.\n\n\nBut the country must wipe out corruption and build its\ninfrastructure.\n\n\nWhat if the Chinese economy overheated, one student asked.\n\n\nShe said there could be a worst-case or best-case scenario but\nstressed that China\'s long-term-prospects were good as its economy was big.\n\n\nOn whether Japan could become a world power on par with the United\nStates, she said that it would take time.\n\n\n" Whether it should become a military power is still being debated\nbut I think it is hard for a country to assert its status if it is not a\nmilitary power.\n\n\n" Japan was now trying to come up with a new concept of world power\nthat excluded the military dimension.\n\n\nThis was a kind of " soft " power, she said.\n\n\nTo questions on the media\'s role in pointing out where overseas\nbusiness opportunities were, she said that the best fallback was still the\ninvestors\' instincts to go where money could be made: " It is no use telling\nthem to go here or there.\n\n\nEntrepreneurs - the good ones - know it even before analysts put the\nfigures down on charts".\n\n\nProf Chan made such an impact on the youngsters that at the end of\nthe session, they gave her a standing ovation.\n\n\n Pre-U Seminar \n\n\n Go regional \'can mean bringing region to S\'pore\' \n\n\nEDB chief cites Michael Jackson concert as example\n\n\nby Chiang Yin Pheng\n\n\nTHE go-regional drive has another dimension - in addition to taking\nSingapore into the region, the region could be brought into Singapore.\n\n\nFor example, the Michael Jackson concert and the Les Miserables\nmusical were events which would draw in audiences and resources from outside\nthe country, said Economic Development Board\'s managing director Tan Chin Nam\nyesterday.\n\n\nWith " borrowed resources" in the form of foreign talents being\nwatched by " borrowed audiences", Singapore would become a cultural and\nentertainment hub for the region.\n\n\nSpeaking to 500 students attending the Pre-U Seminar at the National\nUniversity of Singapore campus, he gave an overview of how Singapore was\nmarshalling its resources for the " go regional" drive.\n\n\nReferring to the forums and workshops being held and the various\nnational plans to entrench information technology, biotechnology and\nautomation, Mr Tan said that they were all part of the " total national\nresponse" to the call.\n\n\nTo illustrate his points more vividly to the 17- and 18-year-olds,\nhe produced graphics, video clips set to pop music and a segment of a\nBroadway musical.\n\n\nHe said that the Michael Jackson and Pavarotti concerts, as well as\nthe musicals Cats and Les Miserables, were steps in bringing a piece of the\nworld into Singapore.\n\n\nFor the Michael Jackson show, he noted that telephone calls for\ntickets were coming from as far as Sri Lanka.\n\n\nSuch events, which bring regional audiences here, would generate\neconomic spin-offs for the hotels and strengthen the economy, he added.\n\n\nAs for Singapore going into the region, Mr Tan gave the example of\nhome-grown entrepreneur Ong Beng Seng.\n\n\nAs holder of the Asian franchise for the Hard Rock Cafe string of\nrestaurants, Mr Ong has opened outlets in Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok\nand will do so in Bali, Taipei and Beijing soon.\n\n\nIn his hour-long speech he urged the students to think Singapore\nUnlimited.\n\n\nSingapore\'s small size meant it could be quick to respond to changes\nin economic conditions.\n\n\nAnd think of the world as a borderless one.\n\n\n" In this new age, cities will compete, but they will also\ncollaborate, drawing on each other\'s strengths," he said, adding that wealth\nwas now measured in how productive a country could be, not how much resources\nit had.\n\n\nThe EDB chief also noted that the public and private sectors still\nhad some way to go in pooling their efforts to build Singapore\'s external\neconomy.\n\n\nDisclosing the findings of a Government survey on cooperation between\nthe private and public sectors, he said that four in l0 respondents thought\nthat current efforts were not enough.\n\n\nBut three quarters of the respondents agreed strongly that the two\nsectors should work together to exploit economic openings outside Singapore.\n\n\nThe gap between reality and the ideal meant that more work still\nremained to be done, he said.\n\n\n Youthful spirit prevails at 65th anniversary reunion of Raffles\nCollege \n\n\nBy Chua Mui Hoong\n\n\nTHEY came, some limping with canes in hand, some supported by spouses\nand friends, nursing arthritic joints and ageing bodies.\n\n\nBut tongues wagged furiously to reveal their youthful spirits when\nthe 250 Raffles College alumni and their spouses got together last night for\ntheir 65th anniversary celebration dinner at the Mandarin Hotel.\n\n\nAs Mrs Lily Padman, 65, said of her husband of 40 years, Stanley 74,\nand his cronies from the batch of 1940: " When they met up, they behaved like\nboys." Not surprisingly these " boys" - whose ages range from about 65 to 86\n\n- recalled the ragging that took place with chuckles.\n\n\nMr Padman said that he got off relatively mildly - he only had to\nsing.\n\n\n" Mr Lee Kuan Yew had to push a mothball with his forehead," he\nrecounted.\n\n\nSenior Minister Lee and his wife, both Raffles College alumni, were\nalso at the dinner, as were former Cabinet ministers Howe Yoon Chong, Lim Kim\nSan and E.\n\n\nW.\n\n\nBarker, and from Malaysia, the Governor of Penang, Tun Dato Seri Dr\nHamdan Sheikh Tahir.\n\n\nMr Paul Chang, 74, said he was almost drowned in the bathtub every\nday for a week.\n\n\nBut it was all good, clean fun, he added.\n\n\nOn a more serious note, he said reflectively: " I was 17 when I\nentered Raffles College.\n\n\nAt the end of it, I was transformed from a raw, diffident timid boy\nto a self-assured young man." He is the former chief inspector GE schools in\nMalaysia.\n\n\nThese boys grew into confident men, many taking up illustrious\npositions in government and commerce.\n\n\nThe college has produced at least two heads of government, three\nheads of state, 11 Cabinet ministers, two attorney-generals, five judges,\nand 23 high commissioners and ambassadors from among its 573 alumni produced\nfrom 1928 to 1949.\n\n\nAfter that, the college was reinstituted to become the University of\nMalaya.\n\n\nThey came back for the three-day anniversary get-together beginning\non Friday, from as far away as Canada.\n\n\nIt was an historic occasion, and at least one man was aware of it.\n\n\n" Look at this, the original college crest," said Mr M.\n\n\nS.\n\n\nSelvamamy, 67, pointing to his breast pocket where his wife had\npainstakingly sewn the college crest cut from his old college blazer.\n\n\n" It\'s a part of history, I can tell you.\n\n\nI will donate it to the alumni office." Many remembered fondly the\nclose ties forged during their college days, when the student population was\nsmall and camaraderie strong.\n\n\n" It was like an extended family," said Mr Selvamamy mistily.\n\n\n" There was no distinction in race, religion, class.\n\n\nWe knew everybody," he added, proving the truth of this by naming in\nan undertone those who were walking into the hotel\'s Belvedere Room for a\nseafood dinner.\n\n\nLast night\'s fare of garoupa, prawn and lobster were a far cry from\ncollege grub served in the post-war years when food was scarce and what there\nwas, was so badly cooked students reportedly threw eggs at the cook.\n\n\nAs Mr Siew Nim Wah, 66, said " The food was so bad when we wrote home\nwe used to say we were given yesterday\'s bread and tomorrow\'s bananas."\nYesterday\'s programme included a tour of the old Raffles College campus at\nBukit Timah, now the National Institute of Education.\n\n\nMadam Tay Kheng Eng, 82, who was among the pioneer batch of 43\nenrolled in 1928, liked the way the modern additions blended in with the\ncolonial-style buildings.\n\n\nBut Mr Khoo Seang Hoe 70, did not.\n\n\n" They have murdered our dormitories," he grumbled.\n\n\nLast night, the men came dressed in dark batik shirts or coat and\ntie, the women wearing pearls and cheongsams.\n\n\nMurmurs of " you look the same", alternated with puzzled stares and\nembarrassed laughs as old classmates failed to recognise each other after not\nmeeting for over half a century. As old boy and now university pro-chancellor\nMaurice Baker put it: " Some have turned into blondes and some have lost\ntheir hair altogether, but this is a good way to crown the anniversary\ncelebrations." \n\n\n\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES SATURDAY JUNE 26, 1993\n\n\n Pre-U Seminar   Passion, not profits alone, drives the\nentrepreneur, say bosses \n\n\nBy Chiang Yin Pheng\n\n\nA MAGNIFICENT obsession - not just the search for profits - is what\nmakes an entrepreneur.\n\n\nHe takes risks in a field he is passionate about and picks himself up\nwhen he fails.\n\n\nThis composite sketch of the entrepreneur emerged yesterday when four\ncorporate chieftains shared their insights with students on the last day of\nthe Pre-U seminar on the theme " Growing the Second Wing: Our External\nEconomy".\n\n\nThey were Wuthelam\'s executive chairman Koh Boon Hwee, Heshe\nHoldings\' managing director Chia Shi Teck, Scotts Holdings\' managing director\nRafiq Jumabhoy and Wah-Chang International\'s president Ho Kwon Ping.\n\n\nMr Koh and Mr Chia saw entrepreneurs as more than just businessmen\nout to make money.\n\n\nMr Koh said an entrepreneur had to start a business which provided\njobs and had growth potential, and which was a fresh, value-added idea.\n\n\n" Mr Ho Kwon Ping is an entrepreneur.\n\n\nHe brought Wah-Chang into the holiday resort business.\n\n\nOf course, the company\'s acquisition of many more resorts don\'t count\nas entrepreneurial moves anymore.\n\n\nThose are business expansions," said Mr Koh, to laughter from his\nfellow panelists and the audience Mr Ho, however, argued that entrepreneurs\noften did not start out knowing the growth potential of their ventures. \n\n\nThis was because their businesses were extensions of their "\nmagnificent obsessions", activities which they enjoyed for their own sake.\n\n\nPeople did not " decide" to become entrepreneurs or receive\ntraining for it, he said, citing Steve Job and Bill Gates of the computer\nindustry and fashion designer Liz Claiborne as those whose businesses grew\nout of their passions.\n\n\nTo the 500 seminar participants, he added: " Your thought process\nshould be \'Is there anything in life I want to pursue\' rather than \'How do I\nbecome an entrepreneur?\' " The panelists agreed that the Government could,\nhowever, nurture entrepreneurial qualities through an education system which\nrewarded creativity, not mere technical competence.\n\n\nMr Jumabhoy noted that the spirit of entrepreneurship often came\nout when individuals were driven to carve out niches for themselves, or to\nprove that they could succeed.\n\n\nThey were people who believed in their chances for success,\nmobilised their resources to grab opportunities and who were in touch with\nwhat their customers wanted.\n\n\n" The entrepreneur should not take on the image of a glorified\nTarzan, steering his company from the top," he said.\n\n\nAll agreed that entrepreneurship had a risk element and on the need\nto accept failure and move on.\n\n\nMr Koh revealed how a million-dollar joint venture he started with\na friend became a\n&dollar;1.4-million loss in six months.\n\n\n" But we persevered and turned the business around.\n\n\nIt\'s doing well now," he said, declining to say what it was.\n\n\nThe panelists also agreed that Government incentives were not the\ncrucial factor in deciding whether an individual took the plunge into\nbusiness here or abroad.\n\n\nPerks were only the frosting on the cake, said Mr Koh, agreeing\nwith Mr Chia that Singaporeans had been going abroad to do business for a\nlong time - without Government support.\n\n\nPerhaps the entrepreneur has been scrutinised too closely,\nsuggested Mr Ho:\n\n\n" All this talk about entrepreneurs is making those who are\nsupposed to be entrepreneurs feel a little like panda bears: Not only are we\nsupposed to be an endangered species, with so many people watching, we can\'t\nactually reproduce in public."', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c179ce94-cb56-4f95-a932-5acc17e10f06', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.799159+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9828090667724609, 'non_english_score': 0.017190933227539062}
{'text': 'No regrets, but I feel loss at leaving ministry: Mattar \n\n\nby Zuraidah Ibrahim\n\n\nDR AHMAD Mattar looked back on his 16 years in Cabinet yesterday and\nsaid he felt a " most heavy loss" leaving the Environment Ministry which he\nhas led since 1985.\n\n\nIn an interview with the press, he said: " It is a ministry that I\nhave come to cherish and love not just for its efficiency and effectiveness\nbut for the cohesiveness and tremendous esprit de corps among its staff.\n\n\n" I have enjoyed every moment of it." The Environment Minister and\nminister-in-charge of Muslim affairs, who is leaving Cabinet on June 30,\nreturned to this theme several times during the hour-long session at his\noffice.\n\n\nRelaxed and affable, he entertained questions from the personal to the\npolitical, but was at his most effusive when describing his Environment\nMinistry work.\n\n\n" I am leaving behind an epoch of my career which concentrated on\nachieving a clean and healthy environment for Singapore," he said.\n\n\n" Although this may not be as well documented as our more historical\nevents, our clean environment is there for all to see.\n\n\nI am proud of this effort and it will always remain in my memory." In\nrecent years, his ministry has boosted efforts to establish Singapore as a\nmodel green city and has ventured into environmental technology as an export\nindustry.\n\n\nThe urbane minister, who wore a silk tie and blue shirt, spoke at\nlength on the subject during the interview, which was interrupted once by a\ntelephone call from a Malaysian minister who had just heard of his decision.\n\n\nHe also released two letters he sent to the Prime Minister the first\nseeking resignation and the second thanking and bidding farewell to Mr Goh\nChok Tong and his colleagues.\n\n\nIn his letter dated April 16, he said he wanted to leave " Cabinet,\nif not...Parliament".\n\n\nHe said: " I have my reasons for wanting to go now.\n\n\nIt is also a promise to my wife which I have to fulfil."\n\n\nHe had first informed Mr Goh he wanted to leave in 1991.\n\n\nBut as the People\'s Action Party had not secured a higher percentage\nof votes, he was asked to stay on.\n\n\nThe Prime Minister\'s landslide victory in the Marine Parade GRC\nby-election last December prompted Dr Mattar to seek resignation again, as he\nfelt that the PAP had recovered political ground.\n\n\nHe told Mr Goh he would continue maintaining Brickworks GRC as a safe\nward for the party.\n\n\nAn ex-university lecturer in applied acoustics, Dr Mattar said\nyesterday he had decided - after much deliberation - not to return to academia.\n\n\nOn his future plans, he said: " As I shall be a private citizen soon,\nI would like whatever I do after July 1 to remain private...\n\n\nuntil such time when I decide to make it known.\n\n\n" I will now take stock of my life, re-assess my position in society\nand give deep thought to what my heart desires." He had no regrets making the\ndifficult decision to leave Cabinet, he said, adding that he was equally\nsatisfied with his work as minister-in-charge of Muslim affairs, particularly\nin education.\n\n\nThe formation of the self-help group Mendaki, he said, had been\ninstrumental in bringing the Malay MPs and Malay grassroots bodies together.\n\n\nAsked why Mr Abdullah Tarmugi was promoted to minister-in-charge of\nMuslim affairs - above eight other Malay MPs, Dr Mattar replied that the\nappointment was decided by the Prime Minister.\n\n\nHe was confident that Mr Abdullah had the ability to take over his\nportfolios.\n\n\nAs chief Malay/Muslim political leader, Dr Mattar steered the\ncommunity through some difficult times, such as during the controversial\nvisit of Israeli President Chaim Herzog in 1986, and when the issue of Malays\nin the armed forces was raised.\n\n\nOffering an insight into the ties among Malay MPs, he said that\ncontrary to some people\'s perception there were no rifts.\n\n\nThey might differ on issues, but always made sure they arrived at a\nconsensus.\n\n\nAs an example, he cited how they took " quite some time" to adopt a\ncommon stand on the Gulf War in 1991 when allied forces bombed Iraq.\n\n\nHe said this was because some MPs saw the war as a religious battle,\nwhile others viewed it as political.\n\n\nIf he seemed measured in his answers about the Malay/Muslim\ncommunity, Dr Mattar was more candid about his experience in Cabinet.\n\n\n" For a while, there will be a void in my life.\n\n\nI had always looked forward to Cabinet meetings," he said.\n\n\nIn his letter dated June 2, he thanked the Prime Minister and his\ncolleagues.\n\n\nThey had been, he said, a " source of strength, support and ideas" .\n\n\n" I shall miss all of you dearly...I bid you and my other Cabinet\ncolleagues a fond farewell and wish you all the very best for the future.\n\n\nI know there are even more challenging times ahead.\n\n\n" I had served the Cabinet and the nation to the best of my ability\nand I hope that I had served them well." A friendly yet firm leader and\nminister FRIENDLY yet firm.\n\n\nThis is how those who have worked with Environment Minister Ahmad\nMattar would describe the 53 year-old leader who is leaving Cabinet at the\nend of this month.\n\n\nDr Mattar\'s exit will be felt most palpably in the Malay community\nwhom he has led for mare than two decades.\n\n\nHe led a group of Malay MPs in 1980 to set up the Malay self-help\ngroup, Mendaki, and was its chairman until last week.\n\n\nThe 1980 Census results which revealed the underperformance of the\ncommunity had prompted him and others into action.\n\n\nAn ex-lecturer in applied acoustics who taught in the then University\nof Singapore, he was inducted into politics after several years of\ninvolvement in Malay grassroots affairs.\n\n\nOn becoming MP for Leng Kee in 1972, he was appointed Parliamentary\nSecretary for Education.\n\n\nHe became Acting Minister for Social Affairs in 1977 and full\nminister later.\n\n\nIn 1985, he took over the Environment portfolio.\n\n\nIn his early years in politics, he emphasised the training of young\npeople and skills upgrading.\n\n\nThat this was a constant theme in his speeches had much to do with\nhis experience then as chairman of the Vocational Institute and Training\nBoard.\n\n\nHe has been at the helm of the Environment Ministry at a time of\nburgeoning interest in " green" issues.\n\n\nHis ministry has evolved from being associated mainly with sanitation\nand vector control, to being at the forefront of efforts to turn Singapore\ninto a model environmental city.\n\n\nIt launched the Clean and Green educational campaign, was behind the\nGreen Plan, and ventured into environmental technology as an export industry.\n\n\nAs the minister-in-charge of Muslim affairs, he has steered the\ncommunity through the troubled years in the early 80s when Malays were doing\nespecially badly in education and faced other problems, such as not being\nadequately represented in the armed forces.\n\n\nHis speeches, always moderate in tone, often urged Malays to look to\nthe future. \n\n\n\n\n Chiam quit after CEC vetoed censure move \n\n\nby Zuraidah Ibrahim\n\n\nMR CHIAM See Tong resigned from the Singapore Democratic Party ( SDP)\nafter its central executive committee ( CEC) did not support his proposal to\ncensure one member.\n\n\nThis was revealed in a letter, dated June 21, to SDP cadres and\nmembers by the party\'s " collective leadership" to explain the change-over.\n\n\nSigned by all 13 CEC members, the letter did not say who Mr Chiam\nwanted to censure.\n\n\nBut sources told The Straits Times that Mr Chiam had wanted to\ncensure his deputy Chee Soon Juan for going on a hunger strike.\n\n\nFormer university lecturer Dr Chee hit the headlines when he went on\na 10-day hunger strike in April, claiming that his dismissal from the\nNational University of Singapore was politically motivated.\n\n\nThe university had sacked him for the improper use of research funds\nto send his wife\'s thesis to an American university.\n\n\nThe SDP, which agreed that the sacking was politically motivated, had\nasked him not to go on the strike, but also said it would respect his\ndecision.\n\n\nThe letter to cadres said Mr Chiam handed in his resignation " on the\nspot" on May 17 at a CEC meeting.\n\n\nNo CEC member present had been willing to support his motion of\ncensure against the particular CEC member, said the letter.\n\n\nHe took this as a vote of no-confidence against him.\n\n\nSeveral attempts were made to reconcile with Mr Chiam, but to no\navail.\n\n\nThe two-page letter said Mr Chiam had placed unacceptable conditions.\n\n\nThese were not disclosed, except that they included the dismissal of\nanother CEC member.\n\n\nAfter a month, Mr Chiam indicated that he was going to inform the\nRegistry of Societies of his resignation.\n\n\n" It was then that the CEC decided that it had no choice but to make\nknown Mr Chiam\'s resignation...," said the letter.\n\n\nThe statement, issued on June 18, said Mr Chiam was stepping down as\npart of leadership rejuvenation.\n\n\nBut he told reporters on the same night that he had resigned to\nsignal the serious differences between him and the CEC.\n\n\nThe letter also said he had disagreed with the CEC on issues " for a\nperiod of time".\n\n\nWhen contacted yesterday, Mr Chiam would only say: " What sort of\npeople are we dealing with here?\n\n\nTheir press statement said it\'s regeneration and now they are saying\nsomething else...\n\n\n" I would not want to wash dirty linen in public.\n\n\nIf there are any issues they want to force on me, I will then answer\nappropriately.\n\n\nI will not say more for now."\n\n\nThe letter to the members said the CEC was committed to collective\nleadership, and that it would be the policy-making body of the party, as\nlaid down in its constitution.\n\n\n" This is the bone of contention between the CEC and Mr Chiam.\n\n\nA party calling itself democratic must have a democratic\ndecision-making process." It added that it had several plans, including\nfinding party premises, publishing a party programme and vision for\nSingapore, and holding a seminar and walkabouts. \n\n\n\n\n SDP committee blocked me on many issues: Chiam \n\n\nBy Zuraidah Ibrahim\n\n\nMR CHIAM See Tong yesterday said the Singapore Democratic Party\'s\ncentral executive committee ( CEC) had blocked him on many issues, making his\nvision of the opposition\'s role in Singapore harder to achieve.\n\n\nIn his first detailed interview of his sudden resignation as\nsecretary-general from the party he founded, he said that these differences,\nincluding over how town councils should be run, had been unresolved for some\ntime now.\n\n\nAs he saw it, the opposition should help in nation-building.\n\n\nIt needed to build itself up as a credible force that did not act\nirresponsibly or have in its ranks men of questionable record.\n\n\n" The opposition must in fact be better than the PAP, be more honest,\nwork harder for the people, be more reliable.\n\n\nBut finding good men is easier said than done," he said in a 50\nminute interview at his law firm.\n\n\nAnd although the CEC might agree with him on these broad principles,\nits members had blocked him, he said.\n\n\nMr Chiam quit as secretary-general when CEC members did not go along\nwith him on the motion to censure assistant secretary-general Chee Soon Juan\nfor his hunger strike.\n\n\nAsked if he saw Dr Chee\'s action as an irresponsible act he said: "\nIn my view, he should not have gone on hunger strike.\n\n\nAnd this is the view of the general public.\n\n\nIt will do more damage in the long term to the party than good.\n\n\n" Mr Chiam, who remains a member of the SDP, also challenged some\ndetails of the account of events leading to his resignation contained in a\nJune 21 CEC letter to members.\n\n\nHe said that although it gave a true picture of his resignation, it\nhad inaccuracies.\n\n\nCEC members, he said, did not vote on his motion to censure Dr Chee\nbut on whether they agreed to have the motion before them.\n\n\nHe said he had tabled the item for the CEC meeting on May 17 but was\nnot allowed to discuss it by chairman Ling How Doong. \n\n\nWhen asked why, Mr Chiam would only say: " You have to ask Mr Ling."\nMr Chiam lost when the matter was put to a vote.\n\n\nThe CEC letter had said that members voted according to conscience.\n\n\nChallenging this assertion, he noted yesterday that eight out of\nthe 14 CEC members were " directly or indirectly employed" in Bukit Gombak\nand Nee Soon Central town councils.\n\n\nMr Ashleigh Seow, Mr Low Yong Nguan, Mr Wong Hong Toy and Mrs Chee\nwere in Bukit Gombak, with Mr Ling as chairman.\n\n\nMr Francis Yong and Mr Abdul Rasheed are in Nee Soon Central which\nis chaired by Mr Cheo Chai Chen.\n\n\n" I am not making any allegation.\n\n\nBut what I want to ask is, if eight out of 14 are in the town\ncouncils, can they vote according to their conscience?" he asked.\n\n\nOn how his view on town councils differed from the rest, he said\nthere ought to be " central control" by the party over the SDP town councils\nas members were elected through their party.\n\n\n" It is not right to give full powers to the MP.\n\n\nHe cannot say, \'The town council is mine, I can do whatever I\nlike\'.\n\n\nThe party had a right to set broad directions, he said, but would\nnot elaborate.\n\n\nReferring to the CEC press statement issued on June 18 which said\nhis resignation was to rejuvenate the party, he said the CEC " cannot even\ntell the truth".\n\n\n" I am 58 and I am fit, hale and hearty.\n\n\nSo there is no reason for me to step down because of health and\nage." He also revealed that he had not been told that there was a 4pm\ndeadline for him to respond to the statement - before it was sent to the\npress.\n\n\nDr Chee was asked, but failed, to inform him of the deadline, he\nsaid.\n\n\nThus he did not know it was out until he met reporters outside his\nhome that night.\n\n\nHe had written to Mr Ling to ask the CEC to discipline Dr Chee.\n\n\nOn the party being without premises, he said he had found an office\nin Geylang which cost\n&dollar;350,000 but members disagreed and the matter was left to Mr Cheo.\n\n\nAsked if he would consider being co-opted into the CEC, as proposed\nby the committee, he replied: " They think they have great powers and they\ncan even co-opt Chiam See Tong, the founder of the SDP.\n\n\nThis is the sort of men we have at the helm now." He added that he\nhoped common sense would prevail among members, noting that the main issue\nwas not the squabbles but the sort of opposition needed.\n\n\n" Let\'s work together to establish that for the sake of country and\nsake of the people."', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0ce40682-e8c7-4fb5-a5ac-c83409c765ae', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.800500+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9919503331184387, 'non_english_score': 0.00804966688156128}
{'text': 'International drug rings steering clear of S\'pore \n\n\nBy David Miller\n\n\nMAJOR international drug smugglers are avoiding using Singapore as a\ntransit station following the arrests of many of their couriers here.\n\n\nIncreased pressure by the Central Narcotics Bureau ( CNB) and the\nsharing of intelligence with other countries in the region have forced these\nsyndicates to alter their smuggling routes.\n\n\nPreviously, couriers flew from Thailand to Singapore, and then caught\nconnecting flights to final destinations in Europe and the United States.\n\n\nNow, couriers moving out of the Golden Triangle - the main\npoppy-growing region which borders Thailand, Myanmar and Laos - travel\neastward, across China to Hongkong, or west to India and Sri Lanka, for their\nconnecting flights, according to foreign anti-narcotics agencies.\n\n\nThe syndicates have altered their methods of smuggling drugs into\nSingapore frequently, but better surveillance and advanced detection\nequipment have continually foiled attempts to bring the drugs here, forcing\nthem to change their smuggling circuits.\n\n\nCNB officers have noted with satisfaction that two major syndicates\nusing Nigerian and Hongkong runners seem to have stopped coming through\nSingapore.\n\n\nIn 1991, the CNB smashed several Nigerian operations, while the last\ntime a Hongkong trafficker was detected here was in July last year.\n\n\nThe change in couriers\' routes has resulted in a fall in the number\nof big-time traffickers facing the death penalty here - from a high of 88 in\n1991 to 72 last year.\n\n\nCNB chief Sim Poh Heng said that its revamped intelligence system and\nbetter co-ordination between the CNB and its counterparts in other countries\nhave also resulted in record heroin seizures, which amounted to 60.5 kg last\nyear - up from just 10 kg six years ago.\n\n\nAs of May 31, 94 of the 372 traffickers who are facing the death\npenalty have been sentenced to death.\n\n\nForty of them have been executed.\n\n\nThe authorities are also paying more attention to drugs smuggled in\nby sea.\n\n\nAlthough there have been just a handful of cases where drugs were\nfound hidden on fishing trawlers, Mr Sim said that the Police Coast Guard,\nwith its faster boats and better radar, will continue to tighten the screws\non drug smugglers at sea. \n\n\n\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES, FRIDAY, JUNE 18, 1993\n\n\n Jail,\n&dollar;50,000 fine for running illegal billiard saloons \n\n\n Students found there will be arrested too \n\n\nBy David Miller\n\n\nILLEGAL billiard saloon operators could find themselves behind bars\nor facing stiffer fines following a decision by the Attorney General\'s\nChambers to charge them under a different law.\n\n\nThe decision to use the Common Gaming Houses Act which carries a jail\nterm of up to five years and a maximum fine of\n&dollar;50,000, will put more bite into police enforcement.\n\n\nThe decision also means that patrons, including students, found\ngambling in such dens could also, for the first time, be hauled to court.\n\n\nThe Act has a presumption which states that any person found in a\ncommon gaming house shall be deemed to have been gaming unless he can prove\notherwise.\n\n\nSuperintendent Ng Kee Hoe, the Commander of Central Police Division\nwho first mooted the idea said: " This Act will definitely have a more\ndeterrent effect on operators.\n\n\n" We also want to issue a stern warning to students during their\ncurrent vacation, that if they are found gambling in these saloons, they are\nliable to be arrested." Operators of illegal saloons were previously charged\nunder the Public Entertainment Act which carries a maximum fine of just\n&dollar;5,000. \n\n\nBut bearing in mind the highly lucrative nature of the\nillegal business, operators had no trouble settling the fine.\n\n\nMore than 100 raids by the police in the past two years hardly made a\ndent in this mushrooming gambling business which was attracting students in\ngreater numbers.\n\n\nMany dens hit by the authorities who confiscated their equipment,\nwere back in business within a week.\n\n\nThis prompted Supt Ng to propose to the Attorney General\'s Chambers\nlast month that the Common Gaming Houses Act should be invoked to deal with\nthe problem.\n\n\nThe Attorney-General gave the go-ahead last week, Supt Ng told The\nStraits Times.\n\n\n" This Act will definitely have a greater deterrent effect on\noperators," said Supt Ng, who warned that the police will continue to\ncrackdown on these saloons.\n\n\n" We will not stop until this menace has been cleaned up." \n\n\n\n\n Girl, 16, among 46 nabbed in massive drug blitz \n\n\n Death for youngest suspect if convicted \n\n\nBy David Miller\n\n\nA 16-YEAR-OLD girl - the youngest suspect to be arrested for drug\ntrafficking here - was among 46 Singaporeans nabbed in a series of raids that\nbegan on Wednesday.\n\n\nThe unemployed girl will be charged as an adult and, like five other\nmen who were arrested in the raids, will face the mandatory death penalty if\nconvicted.\n\n\nThe blitz, codenamed Operation Potato, was the largest in terms of\nsuspects arrested.\n\n\nIt netted 2 kg of heroin with a street value of about\n&dollar;800,000. \n\n\nThis was the second major drug syndicate to be smashed by\nthe Central Narcotics Bureau ( CNB) in the past two months.\n\n\nLast month, CNB officers arrested 18 Singaporeans and seized heroin\nworth\n&dollar;200,000 in a crackdown codenamed Operation Tanah Merah.\n\n\nMr Masbollah Fazal, CNB\'s deputy director, said his men had worked on\nthe latest case for about two months after receiving information that a local\nsupplier was smuggling between 2 kg and 4 kg of heroin each week from across\nthe Causeway.\n\n\nThe drug was sold quickly to a few major distributors who then\nrepacked it into small sachets to be sold to pushers and addicts.\n\n\nAccording to the CNB, the supplier, a 31-year-old unemployed man,\nused pagers and handphones to contact his distributors.\n\n\nHe was very cautious when setting up meetings and normally met a\ndistributor at a pre-arranged spot, but not before keeping close surveillance\nto ensure that he was not walking into a trap.\n\n\nHe even planned multiple escape routes.\n\n\nEach transaction, lasting only a matter of minutes, took place in his\ncar, a white Honda Accord, while he was driving so that he could check easily\nif he was being followed.\n\n\nBoth parties left in different directions immediately after the sale\nwas completed.\n\n\nThe CNB moved in at about 4.30 pm on Wednesday when the supplier was\nseen picking up a known distributor, an unemployed 35-year-old man, at\nSaujana Road in Bukit Panjang.\n\n\nUsing various teams, CNB officers trailed the car, which later\nstopped at Jalan Lokam off Upper Paya Lebar Road.\n\n\nWhen the suspected distributor alighted from the car, the officers\nmoved in.\n\n\nBoth men put up a violent struggle, but were subdued and arrested.\n\n\nA packet of heroin weighing 442 g was found in the distributor\'s\npocket, while\n&dollar;2,600 - proceeds from the drug sale - was found on the supplier.\n\n\nThe distributor\'s rented room in a house along the same road was\nraided.\n\n\nThree men in their 20s and the 16-year-old girl were arrested.\n\n\nThe four were apparently packing heroin weighing 301 g into 43\nsmaller sachets when they were caught.\n\n\nThe supplier\'s flat in Hougang was also raided, and 352 g of heroin\nwas seized.\n\n\nThe man led CNB officers to a flat in Saujana Road later that night,\nwhere another 884g of heroin was found.\n\n\nOnce the main suspects were picked up, the CNB launched a massive\nisland-wide sweep to weed out the rest of the syndicate\'s members.\n\n\nFrom midnight to 6 am yesterday, 40 suspects, including three women,\nwere arrested.\n\n\nMore heroin and 11 packets of opium were confiscated.\n\n\nIn all,\n&dollar;12,150 in cash was seized.\n\n\nMr Masbollah said that 26 of the 40 suspects picked up in the later\nraids tested positive for drug consumption and would be sent for\nrehabilitation.\n\n\nHe said that some of them may be charged with drug possession after\nthey are discharged from the rehabilitation centre.\n\n\nAs a result of the latest raids, " addicts are going to find it more\ndifficult to get their hands on the drugs", he added.\n\n\n" For our part, we are going to do our best to keep the pressure up\nto stop any new syndicates from setting up shop here".\n\n\n Seized: Radio scanner that intercepts signals \n\n\nA RADIO scanner ( right), capable of intercepting signals from\nhandphones, walkie-talkies and possibly even frequencies used by the police\nand the Central Narcotics Bureau ( CNB), was seized in Wednesday\'s drug\ncrackdown.\n\n\nThis is another indication to the authorities that drug syndicates in\nSingapore are using more sophisticated equipment.\n\n\nIn December last year, the CNB seized a laptop computer that was used\nby another suspected trafficker to check his distribution network.\n\n\nCNB\'s deputy director, Mr Masbollah Fazal, said the scanner was used\nprobably to monitor transmissions which could alert syndicate members to an\nimpending raid by the authorities.\n\n\nHe said the scanner had yet to be checked to see if it could tune in\nto police or the CNB\'s radio frequencies.\n\n\nIn the past few years, more drug suspects had been using handphones\nand pagers to set up deals.\n\n\nSeized pagers have been known to provide the authorities with vital\nclues.\n\n\nDuring yesterday\'s press briefing on the drug bust, a few of the six\nseized pagers kept beeping.\n\n\nSaid Mr Masbollah: " We will have to check these numbers.\n\n\nWe could expect more arrests to be made soon." Two main challenges\nfor CNB in fight against drug abuse \n\n\n\n\n Curbing relapse rate \n\n\n Beefing up prevention programme \n\n\nby David Miller\n\n\nTHE two main challenges facing the Central Narcotics Bureau ( CNB)\nwill be to curb the high number of relapse cases among hardcore drug addicts\nand to look into ways to beef up its drug prevention programme.\n\n\nThe CNB\'s director, Mr Sim Poh Heng, made these points while giving\nan overview of the drug situation in Singapore.\n\n\nAlthough the relapse rate fell for the second successive year, it was\nstill high at 70.3 per cent for 1992 - down from its peak of 78.1 per cent\nthree years ago.\n\n\nThe CNB, together with the Prisons Department, which runs the\nrehabilitation programme, will be discussing ways to make the detoxification\nprogramme more effective, particularly for those who have gone through it\nthree or more times but have not been able to break the habit.\n\n\n" The problem of hardcore addicts must be resolved in order to\nimprove the drug situation," stressed Mr Sim, who declined to give further\ndetails as plans are still being worked out.\n\n\nThe CNB is also looking at ways to revamp its drug prevention\nprogramme, to ensure that it leaves a lasting impression on the target group.\n\n\nMost drug addicts here fall within the 20 to 39 age group.\n\n\nMany are school dropouts and are either unemployed or holding\nblue-collar jobs.\n\n\nOn the current drug scene the CNB said that its constant pressure had\neradicated " black areas" - - places where drugs are bought and used openly.\n\n\nIt also said that although the number of drug addicts is believed to\nhave risen marginally last year, this is not a cause for concern.\n\n\n" The drug situation is well under control and will continue to be so\nas long as we do not become complacent about it, said Mr Sim.\n\n\nHe said the CNB\'s simple strategy of tackling the problem of drug\nabuse from both the demand and supply fronts has been effective.\n\n\n" In order to reduce the supply, we hit very hard at drug suppliers,\nfrom small-time street-pushers and distributors to big-time syndicate\nleaders," he said.\n\n\nLast May, in the largest operation in CNB history, 37 suspects were\nnabbed and heroin with a local street value of about\n&dollar;6 million was seized in a blitz codenamed Operation Monopoly.\n\n\nOne reason why drug suppliers continue to try to penetrate the local\ndrug market is the erroneous perception that there is a large market for the\ncontraband here because of the higher prices it commands.\n\n\nThe Woodlands checkpoint remains the main avenue for traffickers to\nsmuggle in drugs meant for local consumption in Singapore.\n\n\n" Drug traffickers are aware that detection is hampered by the high\nvolume of traffic, and they take advantage of this. \n\n\n" We have,therefore stepped up our operations at the Woodlands\nCheckpoint and introduced other features like high-tech equipment and\nnarcotic dogs," said Mr Sim.\n\n\nHe said that for security reasons, he could not elaborate on the new\nequipment.\n\n\nOn the demand side, the CNB arrested a record 5,600 local addicts\nlast year - up from 4,425 in 1991.\n\n\nOne area of particular concern for the bureau is the increasing\nnumber of intravenous drug abusers, whose numbers shot up from 23 in 1989 to\n238 last year.\n\n\nWhile their proportion is still small compared with the total\nnumber of addicts arrested, the CNB is monitoring the situation closely.\n\n\nThe bureau\'s concern is understandable.\n\n\nApart from the higher chance of an overdose, intravenous abusers\nusing shared needles also run the risk of infection and contracting diseases\nsuch as malaria, hepatitis B and Aids.\n\n\nSo far, five people have contracted Aids through intravenous drug\nabuse.\n\n\nThe CNB attributed the rise in the number of such addicts to the\ninfluence of foreign drug abusers, who use needles to administer the drug\ndirectly into the bloodstream for a faster and harder " kick" compared with\ninhaling heroin fumes - or " chasing the dragon" - the method favoured by\nlocal addicts.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9cb815dc-0101-49d9-829f-455d81428eff', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.801882+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9733706712722778, 'non_english_score': 0.026629328727722168}
{'text': 'Bosses and unions split on CPF contributions for workers over 55\n\n\n\nby Ahmad Osman\n\n\nEMPLOYERS and unionists are divided over how much Central Provident\nFund contributions of older employees should be cut in return for allowing\nthem to work past 55.\n\n\nThe Singapore National Employers\' Federation ( SNEF) wants both\nemployees\' and employers\' Central Provident Fund contributions for workers\naged between 56 and 59 to be cut from 12.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent of their\nmonthly salaries.\n\n\nIt has also suggested that the government stop CPF contributions for\nthose above 60 who have paid their housing loans and have enough in CPF and\nMedisave accounts to pay their medical bills.\n\n\nUnion leaders are against the proposals which are backed by the\nSingapore Manufacturers Association ( SMA).\n\n\nThey said that if existing contribution rates had to be cut, the\nreduction should not be more than 2.5 percentage points for those between 55\nand 59.\n\n\nThey also rejected the suggestion that CPF contributions were\nunnecessary for employees above 60.\n\n\nThey argued that many who continued to work after reaching the\ntraditional retirement age of 56 needed Central Provident Fund funds to\nservice their housing loans.\n\n\nThese workers must also continue to top up their Medisave accounts to\nensure that they will be able to pay hospitalisation bills.\n\n\nThe current rate for those between 60 and 64 is 15 per cent, and for\nthat for 65 and above is 10 per cent.\n\n\nThe contributions are split equally between workers and employers.\n\n\nThe rate for those below 55 is 18 per cent for employers and 22 per\ncent for workers.\n\n\nLabour Minister Dr Lee Boon Yang announced in Parliament on March 18\nthat Central Provident Fund rules for older employees will be revised in\ntandem with the proposed legislation to impose a minimum retirement age of\n60.\n\n\nHe gave no details but rejected a call to exempt workers above 55\nfrom contributing to CPF.\n\n\nSNEF president Stephen Lee declined to comment on the percentage of\nCentral Provident Fund cuts expected by the federation.\n\n\nBut he pointed out that companies paying less CPF could offer higher\nsalaries to retirees.\n\n\nAn SMA spokesman said the five percentage point cut SNEF proposed\nwould help offset any loss in productivity from employing older workers who\nare generally slower than their younger colleagues.\n\n\nThe extension of the retirement age, he said, made it necessary to\nstep up efforts to upgrade the skills of Singaporeans in their 40s and early\n50s who wi11 be able to work till 60.\n\n\nMr Diong Tai Pew, president of the Association of Small and Medium\nEnterprises, argued that a cut of 5 percentage points in CPF for employees\nbetween 55 and 59 would help them to compete better for jobs.\n\n\nHe said the Government would allow those above 60 to ask their\nemployers to stop making CPF contributions if they have enough savings.\n\n\nSpeaking for workers, Nominated MP Tong Kok Yeo, the general\nsecretary of Union of Telecoms Employees of Singapore, said a moderate cut of\naround 3 percentage points for those aged between 55 and 59 would be more\npalatable for those concerned about rising medical costs.\n\n\nTwo other unionists, Mr Victor Pang and Mr Cyrille Tan - wanted the\npresent CPF rate to be maintained.\n\n\nBut they were ready to accept a reduction of 2.5 percentage points in\nthe rate for those aged between 55 and 59 Mr Pang, general secretary of the\nSingapore Airport Terminal Services Workers\' Union, said that with average\nlife spans of around 70, those working after 55 need their Central Provident\nFund savings for the next 20 years of their lives Mr Tan, general secretary\nof the United Workers of Electronic and Electrical Industries, said that deep\ncuts in the current rates would contradict the Government\'s aim of ensuring\nthat older Singaporeans had sufficient funds for their old age. \n\n\n\n\n Civil servants can now take half day annual leave on Saturdays\n\n\n\nBy Ahmad Osman\n\n\nCIVIL servants are now allowed to take half day annual leave on\nSaturdays.\n\n\nBut they can do this for only a maximum of six Saturdays in a year if\ntheir services are not required, a spokesman for the Public Service Division\nsaid on Tuesday.\n\n\nThe policy took effect on June 2, she said, and would meet the needs\nof those who cannot avoid appointments at the end of a 5 1/2-day work week.\n\n\nIt was introduced about nine years after the Government revised the\nrule requiring civil servants to take full day leave on week days, weekends\nand the eve of public holidays.\n\n\nThey were allowed to take a half day off on week days.\n\n\nFeedback gathered by the division since then showed that many\nemployees wanted the scheme to be extended to Saturdays.\n\n\nThey felt that it was not fair to take a day\'s leave on Saturdays\nwhen all they needed were only a few hours.\n\n\nThe spokesman said that the limit of six Saturdays would ensure that\nthere would be enough people to provide public services on weekends.\n\n\nIt would also prevent any abuse of the holiday leave arrangement.\n\n\nIf unlimited half-day leave was allowed, an employee with 2 days\'\nannual leave, for example, could take every Saturday off for the whole year.\n\n\nHe would work a five day, instead of a 5 1/2-day week.\n\n\nThe Government had made it clear in the past that the 66,000 strong\ncivil service would not set the trend for the majority of the companies in\nthe private sector to switch to a five day work week.\n\n\nA 5 1/2-day work week is the norm for 70 per cent of the 122,000\ncompanies in Singapore, which numbers about 900,000 employees.\n\n\nAs most of these companies already allow their staff to take half-day\nleave on Saturdays, the latest government policy is not likely to have a\nmajor impact on them.\n\n\nBut it will be welcomed by the 66,000 employees in more than 40\nstatutory boards who have to work for 5 1/2 days a week.\n\n\nThe Housing Board, Port of Singapore Authority, Public Utilities\nBoard and Singapore Tourist Promotion Board have adopted the new policy.\n\n\nStatutory boards have the autonomy to decide whether they should\nfollow the policy, the spokesman said. \n\n\n\n\n Registrar seeks A-G\'s help to settle co-op row \n\n\nBy Ahmad Osman THE Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Mr Ng Fui\nFong has asked the Attorney General for legal advice to help settle a dispute\nbetween two groups battling for the leadership of a thrift and loan society.\n\n\nHe wrote to the Attorney General after the group of four, who lost an\nelection held by Telecoms Credit Coperative Society, failed to comply with a\nrecommendation he made on April 22 this year.\n\n\nHe had asked the losers and the four victors to settle their\ndifferences over the result of the election on April 4 through arbitration in\nthe High Court.\n\n\nThe winners - Messrs Chandra Mogan, Abdul Aziz Sulong, Tan Chwee Kim,\nand Dominic Wong complied.\n\n\nThey filed an application to the court to ask the Chief Justice to\nappoint an arbitrator to look into a complaint by their rivals that there\nwere irregularities in the election.\n\n\nMessrs S Shanmugam, Lee Kim Hong, A.\n\n\nK.\n\n\nLatchumanan and Lim Joo Chye wrote earlier to Mr Ng on April 5\nclaiming, among other things, that many members did not have time to cast\ntheir votes during the election.\n\n\nBut they missed the deadline set by the Registrar for both parties to\napply for the appointment of an arbitrator.\n\n\nTheir main backer, Mr S.\n\n\nMoganaruban, the society\'s chairman, chaired an extraordinary general\nmeeting on May 22 sought by about 400 members.\n\n\nAbout 1,600 members present elected the losers of the April election\ninto the society\'s management committee.\n\n\nIt was held a day after the court lifted an interim injunction\npreventing Messrs Chandra Mogan and his team mates from holding office,\npending the outcome of the complaint referred earlier to Mr Ng.\n\n\nThe action taken by the four who lost the April election has left the\nRegistrar in a quandary.\n\n\nHe does not have the power under the Co-operative Societies Act to\nforce both parties to accept his recommendation to go for arbitration.\n\n\nHe has asked the Attorney General to advise him on his next step and\nis seeking answers to several questions.\n\n\nOne issue raised by Mr Chandra Mogan and his team mates is whether\nmembers should be allowed to hold an EOGM to throw out four officials whose\nelection had not been declared as null and void by the court or the\nRegistrar.\n\n\nHe said he will write to the Registrar to challenge the legality of\nthe EOGM.\n\n\n" If the other group gets away with what they did, members will be\ndiscouraged from contesting elections the society will hold in future as they\ncan be thrown out even if they win," he said.\n\n\nHe said his group were not happy over the society\'s investment in\nPremier Travel, a company which had been losing money for a few years.\n\n\nIn April\'s election, members approved the management committee\'s\nrequest to invest another\n&dollar;500,000 in the firm.\n\n\nMr Moganaruban said they were aware the company was losing money and\nthat additional funds were needed to improve its performance.\n\n\nHe said the EOGM he chaired was held in accordance with the by-laws\nset by the society.\n\n\nHe said an Extraordinary General Meeting must be held within one\nmonth after the committee receives a petition signed by at least 100 of the\nsociety\'s 4,300 members. \n\n\n\n\n Local

up an\n&dollar;18 million factory in France to produce Asian dishes like chicken curry in "\nself-heating" containers for the European market.\n\n\nIt has already drawn up plans for the new factory and has obtained\nabout 12 acres of free land from the French authorities, its managing\ndirector, Mr Paul Tan, said.\n\n\nThe company has not however made a firm commitment to the French\ngovernment, as it is awaiting the results of a detailed study to test the\ndemand for its product, which is going on at the moment, he said.\n\n\nThe results of an earlier preliminary survey had been " very

{'text': 'Long queues at cineplex despite computer system \n\n\nby Cheryl Tan\n\n\nTICKET queues at cinemas are supposed to move faster with a new\ncomputerised system, but not at some when blockbusters are being shown, it\nseems.\n\n\nPatrons may still have to deal with long, slow-moving queues at some\ncinemas when such movies are screened.\n\n\nThe long queues spotted snaking out of the cinema lobby at Changi\ncineplex last Sunday during the screening of Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, are\na case in point.\n\n\nThe computerised system has been in use at the cineplex since last\nmonth.\n\n\nWhen contacted, a spokesman for the Shaw Organisation, which runs\nChangi cineplex, said: \'There was a long queue because of the movie\'s\npopularity." He added: " We have experienced such long queues when popular\nmovies were screened in the past." However, he declined to comment when asked\nwhy the computerised system, which cinema operators said would cut waiting\ntimes for tickets, has not helped.\n\n\nThe cineplex, which has three cinema halls, has only two ticket\nbooths.\n\n\nPatrons can buy both current and advance tickets for a movie shown at\nany of the halls from either booth.\n\n\nThey are also given a choice of seats.\n\n\nSome patrons interviewed felt that this was the reason why queues\nwere still long.\n\n\nSaid housewife K Y Ong, 34: " If the cinema operators want to adopt\nsuch a system where everybody queues at the same place to buy tickets for\ndifferent movies, they should not let patrons choose their seats as it slows\nthe whole process down." Student Alicia Lee, 18, felt that the system was\nunfair to patrons who wanted to see the less popular movies.\n\n\n" The cinema should have separate queues for the different movies\nbeing screened," she said.\n\n\n" It is very unfair that I have to deal with a long and slow queue\njust because another movie that I don\'t want to see is very popular." Some\nother cinema organisations interviewed agreed.\n\n\nAn Eng Wah Organisation spokesman pointed out that Changi\'s system\nmade it confusing for the ticket-sellers.\n\n\n" They will have to switch screens all the time for the different\nshows, which makes it even more time-consuming," she said.\n\n\n" It defeats the purpose of computerising."\n\n\nEng Wah has not computerised its ticketing system yet as it is still\nlooking for the best way to do so.\n\n\nA Cathay Organisation spokesman said another reason for the\ncineplex\'s problem may be that there are only two ticketing booths for three\ncinema halls, but added:\n\n\n" Shaw only started the computerised system not too long ago and is\nstill in the midst of testing the system so these may just be teething\nproblems.\n\n\nWe have to give it some time." \n\n\n\n\n Women are bigger, going by their bras \n\n\nBy Cheryl Tan\n\n\nSINGAPOREAN women have become more developed over the past few years\n- in the bust, that is, said brassiere manufacturers here.\n\n\nAnd younger women are wearing bigger bras at an earlier age too, said\nlingerie manufacturer Triumph International, which has phased out the\nsmallest AA cup from BeeDees, its teenage bra range.\n\n\nIt checked the schoolgirls\' bust sizes at several schools last year\nand measured girls between the ages of 11 and 18 at the yearly talks it gives\nat these schools.\n\n\nTriumph International, which has nearly 70 per cent of the market\nshare of the lingerie industry here, found that girls are wearing bigger bra\nsizes at younger ages.\n\n\nMiss Ginny Goh, a Triumph International spokesman, said it will\nintroduce bras with C cups in their young range here soon.\n\n\nThe letters A, B and C refer to the size of cups, of which A is the\nsmallest.\n\n\nThe AA cup was started for girls who had not developed enough to wear\nan A cup bra comfortably.\n\n\nBra sizes 28, 32, 34, 36 correspond to a woman\'s chest frame measured\nin inches.\n\n\nSales figures also show a trend towards bigger bras.\n\n\n" Our best-selling bra size is now 34 B compared with four years ago,\nwhen it was 34A," said Miss Goh.\n\n\n" There are even women buying more C and D size cups." Spokesmen for\nother lingerie brands, including Wacoal Singapore, St Michael\'s and Vanity\nFair, agreed with Triumph\'s observations.\n\n\nMr Thomas Lam, 48, spokesman for Japanese bra manufacturer Wacoal\nSingapore said: " Over the past 10 years the market share for size 32 bras\nhas slipped 12 per cent while that for size 36 for example, gained 11 per\ncent."\n\n\nHe noted that when converted into actual quantities, the percentages\nindicate a decrease and increase of thousands of bras.\n\n\nWacoal\'s market share for A cup bras dropped by 9 per cent and that\nof B cups rose by 7 per cent - both over the past five years.\n\n\n" This indicates that Singaporean women are not only getting\nbigger-built but better-developed too," said Mr Lam.\n\n\nWhen contacted, two Ministry of Health nutritionists said the\nfindings could be attributed to better nutritional intake in recent years.\n\n\nSaid Dr Mabel Yap, deputy director of the ministry\'s Food and\nNutrition Department, " Our studies show that children and adolescents today\nare bigger-sized and taller than those 10 to 20 years ago."\n\n\nShe said children today would develop faster and earlier as their\nnutritional intake improved with better quality food and increased emphasis\non good dietary habits.\n\n\n" As Singapore becomes more affluent, children will mature even\nfaster because of better food and environment during their growing years."\n\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES, MONDAY, JUNE 14, 1993 \n\n\n\n\n Breast reconstruction throws in a tummy tuck \n\n\nBy Cheryl Tan\n\n\nNOW you can get a new breast and a tummy tuck at the same time\nthrough a new procedure at the Singapore General Hospital ( SGH).\n\n\nDoctors can now more reconstruct a more realistic new breast for\nwomen undergoing a mastectomy with flesh from her lower abdomen.\n\n\nThe result?\n\n\nA softer and more well-shaped breast which has no chance of\nrup-turing - unlike breasts created with implants.\n\n\n" There are many ways of reconstructing breasts using either silicone\nor saline implants, or even using tissue from backs but this, so far, is the\nbest," said Dr Leslie Kuek, 36, a consultant plastic surgeon at SGH.\n\n\n" Other methods may be equally feasible but they all have their\nproblems " he said.\n\n\nSilicone and saline implants could rupture or even harden due to the\nbody\'s reaction to it, and a woman\'s back might not provide adequate flesh\nfor a proper breast.\n\n\nThis new procedure using fatty tissue and muscle from the abdomen,\ncalled the Free Flap operation, has been made available in SGH since July\n1991.\n\n\nBut only 11 women have gone through it so far.\n\n\nIt was introduced after Dr Kuek studied the procedure in Japan for a\nyear.\n\n\nHe felt that Singaporean women should be able to opt for such an\noperation.\n\n\nHe said: " Previously when a woman had breast cancer, she was\ncondemned to wearing stuffed bras.\n\n\n" It is important that such women be given a solution to mastectomy\nwhich makes them feel more normal." The Free Flap operation involves the\nremoval of fatty tissue and muscle from a flap opened at the lower abdomen.\n\n\nSuch tissue is then inserted through a slit near the armpit to form a\nbreast.\n\n\nThere will of course be scars, but Dr Kuek said they will fade with\ntime.\n\n\nThe procedure was first developed in 1979.\n\n\nThe one used at present is the improved version of the Transverse\nRectus Abdominis Myocutaneous ( Tram) Flap in use here for the past eight to\n10 years.\n\n\nThis is a similar transplant of a flap of tissue from the lower\nabdomen except that the tissue cannot be moulded into shape.\n\n\n" It is important that the tissue can be moulded as the breast we\ncreate must match the other natural one exactly in shape and size," he said.\n\n\nTo perfect the look, a nipple can be created by pinching skin\ntogether or by transplanting half of the woman\'s remaining nipple, if ample\nenough, onto the new breast.\n\n\nBut Dr Kuek warned that the procedure cannot be used for women with\nflat abdomens as there would not be enough tissue to transplant.\n\n\nThe operation costs about\n&dollar;8,000 when done with a mastectomy, and\n&dollar;5,800 when done alone.\n\n\nIt increases the operating time for a mastectomy from about 1 1/2\nhours to six or seven hours.\n\n\nDespite this, Dr Kuek advises that patients have both operations done\nsimultaneously.\n\n\n" It reduces the psychological trauma of the mastectomy," he\nexplained.\n\n\n" At least women will wake up from the operation with two breasts,\nnot one." He stressed that there was minimal risk due to the present level of\nexpertise in anaesthesia.\n\n\nBut the selection process for patients is still quite stringent.\n\n\n" We select the stronger and younger patients who can better cope\nwith the strenuous operation," he said.\n\n\nPatients also have to spend at least eight days in hospital\nrecovering.\n\n\nBut patients who have undergone the operation feel that it is worth\nit, with some even experiencing sensation in their new breasts which,\ntechnically, could not happen as the nerves are not re-attached.\n\n\nThose interviewed said the operation made them feel like normal women\nagain.\n\n\nSaid a 54 year-old clerk who did not want to be named: " My new\nbreast is exactly the same shape and size as my old one and matches my other\nbreast perfectly.\n\n\n" The best part is, I emerged from it with a flatter tummy." How the\nfree flap procedure works\n\n\nA piece of tissue and muscle is cut from the lower abdomen\n\n\nAn artery and vein are detached along with muscle, so that the new\nbreast continues to be living tissue\n\n\nA flap of fatty tissue and muscle is removed from lower abdomen after\ndetaching blood supply.\n\n\nThe flap is folded to achieve the desired breast shape.\n\n\nThe flap is inserted into the chest wall.\n\n\nThe blood vessels are rejoined using an operating microscope.\n\n\nA new nipple is created when all wounds have healed.\n\n\n Michael Jackson fans booking Amex priority tickets jam up phone\nlines \n\n\nBy Cheryl Tan\n\n\nMICHAEL Jackson fans yesterday jammed fax and phone lines for\nAmerican Express priority tickets to his concert, while a few teenagers began\nqueueing for discounted tickets from as early as 2 am, although tickets went\non sale only at 11 am.\n\n\nSeveral irate Amex cardmembers who tried unsuccessfully to get\nthrough the whole day called The Straits Times to complain.\n\n\nThe priority offer, which began yesterday and will run until July 15,\nis part of Amex\'s Applause programme and entertainment booking service\nexclusively for cardmembers.\n\n\nThe total number of 90,000 tickets is available to Amex cardmembers\nbut the two promoters, Lushington Entertainment and Sunvic Productions, say\nthat they will ensure that there will be tickets left for non-cardmembers.\n\n\nApplause allows cardmembers to book an unlimited amount of\n&dollar;200 and\n&dollar;125 tickets by just calling or faxing in their orders.\n\n\nThose who want\n&dollar;65 tickets have to book them personally at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.\n\n\nA handling charge of\n&dollar;3 for the first 20 tickets and an additional\n&dollar;3 for every additional 20 tickets is levied.\n\n\nNon-cardmembers can buy their tickets only from July 16.\n\n\nWhen contacted about the phone jam, a spokesman for ticketing system\nSistic confirmed that the response to Amex\'s offer was overwhelming, but\ndeclined to say how many tickets were sold.\n\n\nHe said: " The phones were ringing non-stop the whole day - nothing\nlike the normal response we get while handling bookings for other shows." He\nalso declined comment when asked if Sistic was thinking of adding more phone\nlines to facilitate faster booking.\n\n\nSeveral callers to The Straits Times who were not cardmembers felt\nthat allowing American Express cardholders to book an unlimited amount of\ntickets was unfair.\n\n\nSome said it might even encourage black-market dealings.\n\n\nHowever, Amex spokesman Mrs Helen Rauff said that it had offered\nsimilar booking privileges for other popular shows like David Copperfield,\nbut had not experienced any problems.\n\n\nShe maintained that the system was not unfair, saying: " Cardmembers\ncould be booking large numbers of tickets for their family friends or staff\nwho are non-cardmembers and cannot book them otherwise." \n\n\nAmex cardmembers were not the only ones who had a chance to get\ntickets before other Singaporeans, however.\n\n\nTeenagers staked out the Hard Rock Cafe from as early as 2 am\nyesterday to get the 880 discounted tickets for front-row seats specially\nreserved for those between the ages of 12 and 18.\n\n\nAccording to a spokesman for the show\'s promoters, the first six\nrows for both Michael Jackson\'s shows on Aug 29 and 30 - were reserved for\nyouths at the request of the superstar, who has an affinity for children.\n\n\nAll 880 tickets were sold out by 5.30 pm.\n\n\nThe spokesman said an enthusiastic response from teenagers was\nexpected, but the eagerness of three who started camping outside Hard Rock\nCafe from 2 am and bought tickets for both nights was not anticipated.\n\n\nSaid one of them, 18-year-old student Vivien Chong: " We came just\nas the night crowd at Hard Rock was leaving, so they must have thought we\nwere pretty crazy." " We were plagued by mosquitoes the whole night and\nalmost got dragged into a brawl with about 20 drunken men across the street\nbut it was all worth it."\n\n\nShe added: " Seeing Michael Jackson is something that we have\ndreamt of for the past five years."', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1c11200a-751c-4907-b9b6-8dc06f62caf2', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.803929+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9768112301826477, 'non_english_score': 0.023188769817352295}

" \n\n\n\n\n S\'pore\'s record against music piracy the best in S-E Asia \n Only 5 % of revenue went to fakes \n\n\nBy John Lui\n\n\nSINGAPORE now has the best record against music piracy in South-east\nAsia, according to an official from a piracy watchdog group.\n\n\nAnd this record is second only to Hongkong in Asia.\n\n\nBut a new breed of high-tech pirates - illegally copying compact\ndiscs ( CDs) - lurks around the corner.\n\n\nMs Lisa Gordon, director of communications of the International\nFederation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI), told The Straits Times that\nonly 5 per cent of money spent on music here last year went to pirates\ncompared with 90 per cent a decade ago.\n\n\nIFPI is a worldwide body of sound recording and video producers that\nacts against music piracy.\n\n\nShe said: " Singapore is now a model for other countries in\nSouth-East Asia to follow.\n\n\nIt\'s an accomplishment which speaks for itself." She praised the\nlocal office of the IFPI, the police, the Law and Home Affairs ministries in\nnearly wiping out the sale of pirated cassettes here.\n\n\nWith fewer pirates, legitimate recording companies are making more\nmoney than ever, she said.\n\n\nRecording labels will also foster more new artistes, helping\nSingapore become a regional artistic and cultural centre, she added.\n\n\nLast year, Singaporeans spent\n&dollar;112 million on music, an increase of 13.5 per cent over 1991.\n\n\nMs Gordon is among 200 delegates at the Westin Plaza Hotel attending\na three-day conference on the music business in the Pacific Rim.\n\n\nThe conference, which ends today, is organised by the International\nMusic Market, a Europe-based music marketing company.\n\n\nMs Gordon presented a paper on the state of music piracy in Asia on\nMonday.\n\n\nShe told The Straits Times that in this decade, the IFPI will have to\nfight a new breed of high-tech pirates.\n\n\nAt present, there are many affordable second-hand CD manufacturing\nmachines available to Asian businessmen, she said.\n\n\nOver eight million pirated discs were sold in Asia in 1991.\n\n\nThey were believed to have been made in places such as Taiwan,\nThailand and China.\n\n\nIn fact, the IFPI has civil suits pending against five Singapore\ncompanies which allegedly sold about 40,000 pirated CDs last year.\n\n\nUnlike cassettes, pirated discs can be easily passed off as\nlegitimate copies, she said.\n\n\nThis means recording companies would have to be more sophisticated\nthan the pirates.\n\n\nThey may have to stamp a digital code on the CDs so that officials\narmed with machine " readers" can quickly single out the fakes, she said.\n\n\nThe 1987 Copyright Act makes it an offence to copy intellectual works\nwithout authorisation.\n\n\nOffenders can be fined up to\n&dollar;10,000 per illegal copy, with a\n&dollar;100,000 maximum, and be sentenced to up to five years\' jail. \n\n\n\n\n Take some scrap parts, use your imagination and you get sculpture\n\n\n\nBy John Lui\n\n\nSWATCH watches claim to be part of the arts, but Singapore Automotive\nEngineering believes that art is born of parts.\n\n\nScrap parts from its workshops are being bent, hammered and welded\ninto sculpture by employees in a novel programme to bring culture into a\nworld of rivets and steel.\n\n\nTwelve employees, including five women, are taking weekly classes\nconducted by artist Vincent Leow at the firm\'s workshops in Portsdown Road.\n\n\nSaid Mr Leow: " I hope to have fun with the students.\n\n\nThey are all eager and have good ideas.\n\n\nI\'m showing them how to bring it out." In just three lessons, rusty\nstruts, wheels and rods have been turned into objects called Arrow of Love,\nPromise of the Future and The Horse.\n\n\nOne of the creators of The Horse, computer operator Mary Ang,\n23,signed up because she always wanted to " learn how guys do welding and to\nfeel what it\'s like to wear overalls".\n\n\n" I saw that the scrap pieces I took looked like the body of a horse,\nI decided to make one.\n\n\nWelding is fun," she said.\n\n\nStudents learnt how to wield the 150 volt arc welding set from Mr\nLeow and those among them who are experienced in welding.\n\n\nMr Nasrudin Sahari, 39, welds all day at SAE, working on vehicles,\nbut he said:\n\n\n" Sculpture is different.\n\n\nI can\'t design when I\'m working on a vehicle.\n\n\nBut I can do what I like here, and I find it satisfying." Advertising\nand promotions executive May Ng, 32, who is also taking the class, said she\nhoped to have staff skilled enough to make sculpture good enough to be sold\nfor charity.\n\n\nSAE, which is a subsidiary of Chartered Industries of Singapore, the\nordnance arm of Singapore Technologies, is involved in activities ranging\nfrom the upgrading of military vehicles to taxi rental.\n\n\nThe management agreed to let the workers off an hour early to attend\nthe eight two-and-a-half hour classes and foot the\n&dollar;5,000 plus bill.\n\n\nAlso, the classes recycle the company\'s small amount of scrap, which\nwould otherwise have been thrown away, said Ms Ng.\n\n\nShe said that until they are good enough to be sold, the student\'s\nworks may find their way into the firm\'s small park, framing a carp pond.\n\n\nBut the classes\' most enthusiastic student, Mr Sabahni Zainal, 29,\nwelder, felt his work was ready to be shown.\n\n\nIn just three weeks, he has made a small-scale car and four abstract\npieces.\n\n\nHe said proudly: " Just chrome any of them and they will look good in\nyour house." \n\n\n\n\n Stricter enforcement needed on child restraint law, dealers say\nWe have been taking action against those who flout law: Traffic Police \n\n\nby John Lui\n\n\nNINE major dealers, sitting on 27,000 unsold child restraints, have\ncomplained to the Traffic Police, saying that the authorities should do more\nto encourage people to buy the safety seats.\n\n\nOne of the dealers said that they had placed big orders on the urging\nof the Traffic Police when the law on compulsory child restraints was to be\nintroduced .\n\n\nProject executive Phillip Tan of Car Dynamics, which sells\nrestraints, said: " We feel there\'s not enough enforcement.\n\n\nThere\'s also no publicity about those being booked."\n\n\nThe businessmen are sitting unhappily on 27,000 child restraints\nvalued at more than\n&dollar;2 million, he told The Straits Times.\n\n\nWhen the Traffic Police met the nine dealers in February this year,\nthey were sympathetic.\n\n\nThey promised stricter enforcement and wider publicity, he said.\n\n\n" We hope more can be done to make parents aware of the dangers of\ndriving without child restraints.\n\n\nWe believe many are still not using them," he said.\n\n\nAccording to dealers, sales show that less than half of the vehicles\nwhich need them have them.\n\n\nA Traffic Police spokesman confirmed the February meeting and said: "\nThe dealers were informed that with the end of the educational phase, as it\nwas nearly five to eight months after the introduction of the new child\nrestraint requirements, enforcement action was being taken."\n\n\nHe said meetings with the motor trade industry were to keep the\npolice abreast of developments in the industry.\n\n\nThe dealers sell brands like Evenflo, Aprica, Safe-n-Sound, HTS and\nBritax Romer.\n\n\nMr Brinal Chua, sales manager of Car Dynamics, said that his company\nhad imported 12,000 seats before the child restraint laws were passed in July\nlast year.\n\n\nThe Traffic Police had urged dealers to make restraints readily\navailable to the public, he said.\n\n\n" If I had known sales would be so slow, I would not have bothered,"\nhe said.\n\n\nHis company is storing 6,000 unsold seats valued at\n&dollar;800,000, in two warehouses at a cost of\n&dollar;10,000 a year.\n\n\nThe company has also spent\n&dollar;200,000 on advertising.\n\n\n" We had expected a rush to buy when the laws were introduced last\nJuly.\n\n\nWe are still waiting," he lamented.\n\n\nA market survey by the industry, based on census reports and figures\nfrom the Registry of vehicles had shown that one-third of the 300,000\npassenger cars here needed restraints.\n\n\nAs of July last year, children under eight years sitting in the\nfront seat of a car, pickup or truck had to be secured with child restraints.\n\n\nIn October, this requirement was extended to children sitting in the\nback seat if there were rear seat-belts.\n\n\nSeat belt laws: 183 booked ONE hundred and eighty-three people have\nbeen hauled up by the Traffic Police for flouting seat belt laws so far this\nyear, 56 of them for not putting restraints on children in their vehicles.\n\n\nIn a statement to The Straits Times on Saturday the Traffic Police\nsaid at least 127 ignored the available rear seat belts in their vehicle.\n\n\nAs of last Friday, 56 motorists had been summoned for ignoring the\nchild restraint requirements.\n\n\nAs the rules were introduced for the safety of motorists and their\npassengers, all motorists should observe them, said the police.\n\n\nSo far, two children under eight years have been killed in reports\nof accidents since the child restraint law was introduced.\n\n\nNeither child was in a restraint.\n\n\nIn December, Mohammad Iqbal, a two-month-old baby boy, died along\nwith three adults after the car he was in crashed into a bus along

{'text': 'Clan\'s recreation club woos ex-Perfect Match participants \n\n\nBy Wang Hui Ling\n\n\nA HOKKIEN district clan has found a novel way to boost its membership\n- by recruiting young men and women who had taken part in the Singapore\nBroadcasting Corporation\'s television dating game show, Perfect Match.\n\n\nThe youth arm of the Lam Ann Association formed the Perfect Match\nRecreation Club in 1990 to bring together the game show participants.\n\n\nIt now has 300 members.\n\n\nAnd, true to the objective of the game show, it can boast of one\nmarried couple and four others heading up the aisle.\n\n\nLam Ann\'s spokesman, Ms Linda Chia said that the idea for the club,\nfor singles only, came about after the clan sent some of its younger members\nto be part of the studio audience in the show.\n\n\nSBC\'s Perfect Match, which ended in April after a six-year run,\npaired up singles who were brave enough to be teased on national television.\n\n\nIt did not confine its matchmaking efforts to contestants.\n\n\nEvery week, two organisations sent a team of 3 men or women to form\nthe studio audience, who also stood a chance to win prizes.\n\n\nThe 30 clansmen who took part in the show later met other\nparticipants and decided to keep in touch by forming the club, and the clan\nchipped in with money and the premises.\n\n\nThey also printed recruitment leaflets which were distributed to\nthose who took part in subsequent Perfect Match programmes.\n\n\nMs Chia said that the club\'s aim was to let members socialise,\nadding: " We are also trying to respond to the Government\'s call to young\npeople to get married earlier."\n\n\nBesides getting members together or traditional clan activities such\nas Lunar New Year celebrations, the club also organises cycling trips and\npicnics.\n\n\nTwo club members, sales executive Vincent Teo and clerk Anna Lim,\nboth 23, tied the knot two weeks ago.\n\n\nMr Teo said he met his wife on a Perfect Match programme three years\nago and decided to join the club for recreation and to keep in touch with\nother participants.\n\n\nWhile the fresh approach to recruitment has won them many young\nmembers, not all club members, however, have ancestors who originated from\nthe Nan-an region in southern China.\n\n\nAsked if this contradicted the clan\'s founding principle, Mr Teo Kek\nYeng, head of the clan\'s youth roup, said that the clan has always accepted\nany Chinese, regardless of their ancestry, as members.\n\n\nBut the clan does insist that only those whose ancestors were from\nNan-an can stand for election to the executive committee.\n\n\nHe added that few people today knew or cared about where their\nancestors came from.\n\n\n" Society has changed, most Chinese are born in Singapore, and we\nwill have to make suitable adjustments and not keep insisting on such\nlocality links," he said. \n\n\n\n\n Hainan clan leader eyes top post in umbrella body \n\n\nBy Wang Hui Ling\n\n\nTHE man involved in a leadership tussle at the Singapore Hainan\nSociety is now making a bid for power in the umbrella body.\n\n\nDental surgeon Cheng Tim Jiam, 54, said that he and about 30 others\nwould contest the elections at the annual general meeting of the Kiung Chow\nHwee Kuan at NTUC Conference Hall on Sunday.\n\n\nThe Kiung Chow Hwee Kuan, headed by lawyer Wee Tin Teck, 71, serves\nas an umbrella body for about 60 Hainanese clans here.\n\n\nIt is based in Beach Road and has assets totalling\n&dollar;15 million.\n\n\nTwo factions Dr Cheng\'s and another - are now claiming leadership of\nthe 37-year-old Singapore Hainan Society.\n\n\nBoth are now waiting for a ruling from the Registry of Societies.\n\n\nDisclosing his plans to The Straits Times last night, Dr Cheng said\nthat his group will vie for the 3 seats on the executive committee of the\nKiung Chow Hwee Kuan.\n\n\nThis will be the second time that the Young Turks, as they are\ndubbed, are planning to take over the reins of the umbrella body.\n\n\nThey failed in their last bid in 1991.\n\n\nAsked if he might be viewed as a troublemaker, given his involvement\nin a number of disputes, Dr Cheng said: " Whatever I do, there will be people\nwho will say it is good and people who will say it is bad.\n\n\nWhat\'s important is that I know what I am doing. "\n\n\nHe said that he is taking an active part in clan activities as he\nfears that with falling membership, clans would be made irrelevant if they do\nnot modernise soon.\n\n\n" If there are people who are willing to pay\n&dollar;200,000 to join a golf club, why is it that clans, with their low admission\nfees cannot attract more people to join?\n\n\n" There must be something wrong with it somewhere, right?"\n\n\nDr Cheng said this is why he is leading young professionals into the\nclans and introducing new activities such as golf tournaments.\n\n\nOne of his supporters, Mr Edwin Chan, said that they are not out to\noppose for the sake of opposing.\n\n\n" Our main objective here is to effect change in the clans.\n\n\nHow many organisations have the same leader for 25 years?" And what\nif they lose the elections again on Sunday?\n\n\nDr Cheng said he does not rule out trying again.\n\n\nHe said that with the interest sparked by the controversy, he has no\ndoubt that more Hainanese would step forward and join him in serving the\ncommunity.\n\n\nContacted yesterday, Mr Lee Ah Fong, Kiung Chow Hwee Kuan\'s\nvice-president, said in Mandarin: " We will definitely be contesting the\nelections. "\n\n\nHe said that it was possible that Mr Wee, who has been at the helm of\nthe clan for 25 years, might contest the election, but did not wish to give\nfurther details. \n\n\n\n\n Rebel leader fails again to lead Hainan clan body \n\n\nBy Wang Hui Ling\n\n\nREBEL Hainanese clan leader Cheng Tim Jiam yesterday failed in his\nsecond attempt to enter the executive committee of Singapore\'s biggest\nHainanese clan.\n\n\nOnly 87 members of the Kiung Chow Hwee Kuan, the umbrella body for\nabout 60 Hainanese clans, voted for him, about 100 fewer than for the last\nperson voted into the 3-member policy-making committee.\n\n\nOnly three clansmen in Dr Cheng\'s slate of candidates were voted in.\n\n\nBut they were also supported by the incumbent clan leaders.\n\n\nThe other 30 seats were also won by the incumbents\' nominees.\n\n\nThe clan\'s president of 25 years, lawyer Wee Tin Teck, 71, did not\ncontest.\n\n\nHe had said that he wanted to make way for younger leaders.\n\n\nThe committee, which will sit for a two-year term, will elect its new\npresident and other office-bearers soon.\n\n\nDr Chau Sik Ting, 53, a People\'s Action Party MP for Thomson from\n1980 to 1984, polled the most votes out of a possible 449.\n\n\nHe was nominated by both factions.\n\n\nThe talk is that he could be the next president of the clan which\nholds assets worth\n&dollar;15 million.\n\n\nIt is based at Beach Road.\n\n\nDr Cheng, 54, a dental surgeon, admitted defeat but expressed\nsatisfaction that Dr Chau had been elected as a committee member.\n\n\n" Change is coming about...so that is good.\n\n\nI do not have to be in," he said Dr Cheng and his group of\nprofessionals - dubbed the Young Turks - have been embroiled in several\nleadership disputes in recent years.\n\n\nThey and their rivals in a leadership tussle over the Singapore\nHainan.\n\n\nSociety are now awaiting a ruling from the Registry of Societies.\n\n\nDr Cheng s group made its first bid to join the Kiung Chow Hwee\nKuan\'s executive committee in 1991.\n\n\nThe police had to be called in when the meeting became rowdy.\n\n\nIn contrast, yesterday\'s voting at the Singapore Conference Hall\nproceeded peacefully.\n\n\nBut some clansmen, who are also Singapore Hainan Society members,\nwere heard complaining about Dr Cheng\'s role in the society\'s leadership\ndispute.\n\n\nThree Cisco officers hired by the clan were seen walking about.\n\n\nAlso present were two photographers hired by Dr Cheng\'s supporters to\nmake sure that " everyone is accountable for what they say and do", said one\nof the supporters.\n\n\nMany of the elected members interviewed said that they were not\nagainst Dr Cheng\'s claim that clans should be modernised to attract younger\nmembers.\n\n\nBut lawyer Lee Chin Seon, 36, who was elected into the executive\ncommittee, felt that Dr Cheng wanted to change things too drastically.\n\n\n" Change is necessary but it must be evolutionary, not\nrevolutionary," he said.\n\n\nSaid Mr Lee: " The older generation wants continuity.\n\n\nWhile the young have different aspirations from the old, they must\nstill co-ordinate and learn the ropes from the older generation." \n\n\n\n\n Satisfying a sweet tooth for gold \n\n\n Upmarket eateries offering gold-speckled cakes \n\n\nBy Cephah Tan\n\n\nFANCY eating gilded food?\n\n\nYou can do so now at some upmarket eateries without causing too big a\nhole either in the pocket or in the teeth the gold simply melts in the mouth.\n\n\nGossamer-thin petals of gold, which crumble at the slightest touch,\nare being dabbed onto dainty cakes and pastries to add a sparkling and rich\nfinish.\n\n\nEating gold is fashionable in Japan and Thailand, where it is\nconsidered to be a gift from god only the very rich can afford to eat it.\n\n\nIt is supposed to make complexions glow like gold.\n\n\nBut it has yet to catch on here although the Ministry of the\nEnvironment has said that eating gold is harmless.\n\n\nAt the Pan Pacific Hotel a customer can order the Empress Pigeon Tea\nwith Quail Eggs and Morelle, a soup served in a bowl and covered with gold\nfoil, for special functions only.\n\n\nOne serving sets you back by\n&dollar;24. \n\n\nThe Pan Pacific and the Shangri-La offer the hosts of functions\nheld at their hotels chocolates and pastries garnished with gold flakes.\n\n\nMr Darryl Wee, Pan Pacific\'s public relations manager, said that the\ngold foil comes from Thailand and each piece weighs only 0.25 g S & P\nrestaurants, a food chain in Thailand, is also putting gold on sweets,\ncookies and cakes at a Thai food fair held at the Concorde Hotel this month.\n\n\nMiss Chandnibha Suriyong, S & P vice-president, said: " In Thailand,\ngold is used to decorate desserts for festivals and celebrations like\nweddings.\n\n\nIt is used traditionally in desserts for royalty."\n\n\nShe added: " Gold, being very expensive and beautiful, is believed to\nbe a gift from god.\n\n\nIn the past, only the very rich could afford to eat it.\n\n\nIt is supposed to increase your longevity and make your complexion\nglow like gold."

{'text': 'Private firm gets job to ferry SAF troops to Pulau Tekong \n\n\nBy Matthew Pereira\n\n\nA PRIVATE company has taken over the ferrying of SAF troops and\nequipment from the mainland to its training area on Pulau Tekong.\n\n\nThe move is part of the Defence Ministry\'s on-going efforts to\nprivatise its non-essential services to keep manpower costs down.\n\n\nIt will also help free the resources of the Republic of Singapore Navy\n( RSN), which has been ferrying the troops, for more effective operational\ndeployment.\n\n\nThe task of shuttling the Changi-Tekong route was given to Tian San\nShipping two months ago.\n\n\nThe shipping company\'s general manager, Mr Ho Sow Wah, said: " The\narrangement with the navy is on a time-charter basis, where we provide the\ncrew, fuel, boat, maintenance and everything."\n\n\nHe added: " The arrangement is just like chartering a bus the people\nengaging us do not have to worry about anything."\n\n\nThe vessels used for the ferry service, each 30-metre-long, can match\nthe RSN\'s capability and can transport, for example, six three-ton trucks at\none go.\n\n\nBut most of the time they will be used to ferry recruits who do their\nBasic Military Training on Pulau Tekong to and from the island.\n\n\nThe company has to match the navy\'s readiness level as well.\n\n\nSaid Mr Ho: " We have to have two of these vessels on stand-by, 24\nhours a day, 365 days a year." The vessels make scheduled trips to the island\nand back but are available on call too.\n\n\nNoted Mr Ho: " There are times when the SAF holds night training, and\nwe have to move the men back at whatever time they finish their training."\nThe move to hire a civilian contractor to operate the ferry service ties in\nwith Mindef\'s objective of making better use of scarce manpower resources.\n\n\nIt has been increasing its use of civilian staff or contractors in\nsupport roles to release more SAF personnel for combat duties.\n\n\nThe privatisation of the service also allows the navy to reduce the\nadministrative duties and responsibilities for the ferry service.\n\n\nThe RSN had a similar arrangement with the Port of Singapore\nAuthority, which took over the ferrying of men to the Brani Naval Base from\nthe navy for some time.\n\n\nIt ended recently with the opening of the bridge to the island last\nyear. \n\n\n\n\n Best Unit Award winners find it tougher each year \n\n\nBy Matthew Pereira\n\n\nWITHIN a year, the RSS Valiant not only joined the Navy as a fully\noperational battle ship, but also went on to take this year\'s Best Ship\naward.\n\n\nIts commanding officer Major Chng Teow Hiang, said the award did not\ncome by accident.\n\n\n" We started off with the objective of winning the award," he said.\n\n\nOther winners include the commandos, who picked up the Best Combat\nUnit title for the 11th time, while the Air Force\'s 125th Squadron took the\nBest Tactical Support Award.\n\n\nThey are among 11 top units from the Army, Navy and Air Force which\nwill receive the much-sought after Best Unit Awards at the Singapore Armed\nForces Day Parade on July\n\n\n1. The Valiant became fully operational in March last year and wasted\nno time setting its sights on the award, said Major Chng.\n\n\nHe added: " You do not just saunter along and hope that you win the\naward by chance."\n\n\nHe said he checked the unit\'s progress every month, rectified what he\nthought were its weak areas and kept at improving the whole year.\n\n\n" This is also a competition for consistency," he noted.\n\n\n" It assesses your year-round performance.\n\n\nYou cannot make a sprint in the last quarter and hope to pick up the\naward." The Best Combat Unit, the 1st Commando Battalion, on the other hand,\nis an old hand at winning the competition.\n\n\nIt picked up the award for the 11th time since 1974.\n\n\nBut the unit\'s Commanding Officer, Major Chiang Hock Tew, said: " It\nis get-ting harder each year.\n\n\n" The point count of the top units is getting closer by the year.\n\n\nBut it is the reputation, the fact that we are the Commandos, the\nelite, the ones with the red beret which makes the men push themselves a\nlittle bit harder." The Commandos are experts in several special skills, such\nas rappelling, jungle survival, demolition, infantry small arms and signal\ncommunications.\n\n\nFor 125 Squadron, realistic tactical flying was one of the factors\nwhich clinched the award for them, said its commanding officer, Major S\nThanabalan.\n\n\nHe did not want to elaborate on what tactical flying meant, except to\nsay that it was more than flying from point A to point B.\n\n\n" Doing that is really tough and pushed the men to their limits.\n\n\nEveryone talks about learning from their mistakes.\n\n\n" We cannot make mistakes." \n\n\n\n\n Navy\'s first mine hunter launched in Sweden \n\n\nBy Mathew Pereira\n\n\nTHE first of the Singapore Navy\'s new mine countermeasure vessels (\nMCMVs), was launched in Sweden by Mrs Yeo Ning Hong, the wife of Singapore\'s\nDefence Minister, on Thursday.\n\n\nChristened RSS Bedok, it is one of four such vessels which the\nRepublic of Singapore Navy ( RSN) is acquiring to protect and keep\nSingapore\'s sea lanes of communication open.\n\n\nThe other three minehunters are the RSS Kallang, RSS Katong and RSS\nPunggol.\n\n\nThe 47-metre-long ships, weighing 360 tons each, are highly\nmaneuverable and can detect, locate, identify and destroy mines.\n\n\nThey can reach speeds of up to 15 knots and are each equipped with a\n40 mm Bofors gun and computerised navigation and minehunting information\nsystems.\n\n\nThey also carry remote-operated underwater mine disposal vehicles.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Defence said in a press statement that the narrow and\nshallow sea lanes around Singapore are vulnerable to mining, and that the\nminehunters will keep this economic lifeline open and safe.\n\n\nThe Swedish-built RSS Bedok is being outfitted and will undergo sea\ntrials later this year before it is delivered to Singapore early next year.\n\n\nThe hulls of the other three ships were also built in the\nKarlskronvarvet Shipyard in Sweden, but will be outfitted here by Singapore\nShipbuilding & Engineering ( SSE).\n\n\nOne is being outfitted in Singapore and the other two will be\ndelivered to Singapore at intervals over the next few years.\n\n\nA project team comprising officers and engineers from the Defence\nMaterial Organisation ( a member of the Defence Technology Group, Mindef) and\nthe RSN designed and developed the ships.\n\n\nThe ships\' names were picked from a selection of entries sent in by\nparticipants of the Navy\'s " Name Hunt" contest launched in January.\n\n\nPresent at the launch of the first MCMV in Sweden were the Minister\nfor Defence, Dr Yeo Ning Hong; the Swedish Defence Minister, Mr Anders\nBjorck; the Chief of Navy, Colonel Kwek Siew Jin; and senior Mindef, RSN and\nRoyal Swedish Navy officers.\n\n\nDr Yeo, who is on a three-day visit to Sweden, called the launching\nof the RSS Bedok " another symbol of the close defence relations between\nSweden and Singapore".\n\n\n" Our two countries share many similarities.\n\n\nBoth of us are small nations in regions of larger nations," he noted.\n\n\n" Both of us are committed to defence in order that our people may\ncontinue to live in peace and prosperity." The ultimate male?\n\n\nWhy did they do it?\n\n\nGERALDINE KAN asks a doctor, a banker and an engineer, who are all\ngame to show themselves off in the Manhunt contest later this month.\n\n\nON JUNE 25, a doctor, banker and engineer will exchange their work\nsuits, ties and in one case, stethoscope, for skin-tight swimming trunks and\nevening wear, parade around on stage and vie for the title of the ultimate\nSingapore man.\n\n\nClean-cut and smart, the three are finalists in the Manhunt Singapore \'\n93 contest beauty pageant for men.\n\n\nIn casual shirts and jeans, relaxed and smiling after a game of pool,\nRohan Mendis ( doctor), Kenneth Tan ( banker) and Timothy Wang ( engineer),\nall look like the sweet young man next door.\n\n\nSo why do they allow themselves to become part of a beefcake flesh\nparade?\n\n\nOr are they really a shortlist for the ultimate, as the organisers,\nMetromedia, claims?\n\n\n" It\'s not just about looks and body," says 25-year-old Mendis, who\nentered the contest to see how far he could go.\n\n\n" You\'ve got to show your confidence and personality - there\'s much\nmore to it." Points are divided between swimwear, evening wear and\noff-the-cuff interview segments to judge their physique, poise and\npersonality.\n\n\nTheir co-workers seem to take their competing in stride.\n\n\nWang\'s general manager even teased the 27-year-old about being extra\ncareful on the streets after all the media attention.\n\n\nTan is pretty confident that fellow bankers and clients will not\nthink any less of him.\n\n\n" They know I draw a line between my professional life and extra\ncurricula activities.\n\n\nI still take my work very seriously." And if someone laughs at the\n25-year-old who has to saunter in his skivvies?\n\n\n" That\'s a risk I\'ll have to take," says Tan.\n\n\nMostly, it is the " personality" part of the contest that the three\nguys hinge on to take the edge off the flesh parade charge.\n\n\n" It\'s not degrading.\n\n\nIt\'s really not that different wearing swimming trunks on stage or at\nthe beach, people still look at you," says Wang.\n\n\n" Anyway, even a good physique doesn\'t come just like that it takes\ndiscipline and work." Mendis\' mother, however, apparently stared in surprised\nsilence at a sizeable colour photo of her son, in tight swimming trunks in\nThe New Paper.\n\n\nAnother relative said he was so embarrassed that he would not attend\nthe finals.\n\n\nHis girlfriend, however, has been very supportive of his move, from\ndiscussing the pros and cons of entering the contest, to telling him how to\nremove his makeup after a shoot.\n\n\nBut a brief walk on stage is where they draw the line.\n\n\nThey say that they would never parade around in G-strings or do a\nstriptease like the Hotbods men did a few months ago.\n\n\n" Shows like that are designed to inspire lust - now that\'s\ndegrading," says Tan.\n\n\nSo just what is the ultimate Singapore man, anyway?\n\n\n" Intelligent, with above-average looks, healthy someone who lives\nlife to the fullest," he says, and smiles cheekily.\n\n\n" I\'d rate myself an eight since I model the ultimate after myself."\nSo why did they enter?\n\n\nIs there not just a tiny urge to show off?\n\n\n" We just want to present ourselves at our best," says Tan, " After\nall, we\'re supposed to represent the ultimate." Fair enough, but take note.\n\n\nThese are three guys who did push-ups before the photo session to\nmake their muscles look bigger in front of the camera.\n\n\nThe finals for Manhunt Singapore \' 93 will be at Orchard Hotel on\nJune 25 at 8.30 pm.\n\n\nTickets are at\n&dollar;88 and\n&dollar;128, inclusive of dinner at 7 pm.\n\n\nCall Metromedia on 334-0818. \n\n\n\n\n Three generals promoted \n\n\nBy dominic Nathan\n\n\nThree Singapore Armed forces officers will move up to the rank of\nmajor-general in this year\'s promotion exercise.\n\n\nAdding a second general\'s star to their epaulettes are the Chief of\nArmy, Brigadier-general Lim Chuan Poh; the chief of Air Force, BG Raymond Ng;\nand the chief of Joint Staff, BG Ng Yat Chung, who is also the directore of\nthe joing operations and planning directorate.\n\n\nThey are among 477 officers promoted this year.\n\n\nThose promoted to lieutenant-colonel or a higher rank received their\ncertificates of promotion from the Deputy Prime Minister and Defence\nMinister, Dr tony Tan, yesterday.\n\n\nAmong them are two women officers who are being made\nlieutenant-colonel, the highest rank so far for women in the SAF.\n\n\nBut heading this year\'s list is the chief of Defence Force,\nLieutenant-general Bey Soo Khiang who retains the same rank but moves up in\ngrade from superscale B to B1.\n\n\nFour officers holding the rank of brigadier-general and one officer\nwho is a rear-admiral, the naval equivalent of that rank, are also being\npromoted in grade.\n\n\nGetting their first general\'s star to break intot the top echelons\nof military hierarchy as brigadier-general are six officers who are now\ncolonels. \n\n\nIn addition, five officers holding the rank of lieutenant-colonel,\nand who are all SAF Overseas Scholars, are being promoted in grade to\nsueprscale G.\n\n\nAll are 32.\n\n\nThe Strait Times, June 30 1999', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '20fdcc20-a892-462e-91b0-9304c448fb63', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.807383+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9763180017471313, 'non_english_score': 0.023681998252868652}
{'text': 'PAP Foundation to cap nursery places at 20,000 for few years \n\n\n Foundation\'s top priority is to provide kindergarten education\n\n\n\nby M. Nirmala\n\n\nNURSERIES run by the PAP Community Foundation ( PCF) offered about\n9,000 extra places last year to meet the demand from parents in neighbourhood\nestates, said Dr Arthur Beng.\n\n\nThe chairman of the PCF kindergarten committee told The Straits Times\nin an interview that about 21,000 places were provided last year compared\nwith only about 12,000 places in 1991.\n\n\nBut, 20,000 places is the limit, he said.\n\n\nThe cap at 20,000 will stay for the next few years and this total will\ncater for about half the number of babies expected to be born.\n\n\nThis limit will remain until the PCF is able to cope with its No.\n\n\n1 priority to provide kindergarten education.\n\n\nKindergarten education, he said, is more important as it helps\nprepare children for primary education.\n\n\nHe said: " We have noticed the surge in demand for nurseries in the\npast five years.\n\n\nBut, nurseries are not our priority.\n\n\n" Its better that a child looks forward anxiously to going to\nkindergarten rather than cry when he goes to nursery," he said.\n\n\nHe added: " There is no necessity to generate a demand for nursery\nplaces." The Straits Times asked him to comment on the growing demand for\nnursery places at PCF-run kindergartens, and how the foundation, a main\nprovider of kindergarten places at 240 education centres, is going to cater\nto the demand.\n\n\nThe centres, spread out in Housing Board estates, charge about\n&dollar;30 a month for three-year-olds who attend two-hour nursery classes a day.\n\n\nAt kindergarten, five- and six-year-olds attend two- or four-hour\nclasses daily and, depending on what they study, pay\n&dollar;20 to\n&dollar;80 a month.\n\n\nPrivate centres charge about\n&dollar;150 for nursery and\n&dollar;500 for kindergarten classes.\n\n\nThe PCF, Dr Beng said, has seen the demand for nursery places coming,\nbased on these two developments: THE birth rate has been going up since 1987\nand is now about 49,000 a year PCF kindergartens have seen a big jump in the\nnumber of nursery places up from 11,893 in 1991 to 20,825 in 1992.\n\n\nThe number should stabilise at around 20,000 a year and hence the\nPCF, which runs these classes, has decided to cap them at this figure.\n\n\nThe PCF will be able to cope with this target as 3 education centres\nhave been built in the past two years.\n\n\nDr Beng had this advice for parents: " Do not be coerced by peer\npressure, otherwise your child is the one who will lose out." Parents\ninterviewed earlier said that they were sending their children to nurseries\nto help them make more friends and study.\n\n\nMany are uncomfortable with the idea of maids teaching their\nchildren.\n\n\nThey feel that maids should only wash, feed and look after children.\n\n\nDr Beng also asked parents to be accommodating as not every child can\nbe placed at a centre in the block where they live.\n\n\n" We understand that the children are young.\n\n\n" We know that walking three blocks and crossing two streets may be a\nproblem for them," he said THERE are no tests and homework in PAP Community\nFoundation ( PCF) nurseries and parents are wrong if they think that studying\nthere will help their young to top Primary 1, said Dr Arthur Beng.\n\n\nInstead, the three-year-olds studying at the 174 education centres\nare taught through play how to listen, speak, socialise and hold a paint\nbrush.\n\n\nA structured syllabus to teach language skills and numbers is used\nonly when the children attend kindergarten classes at age five and six.\n\n\nDr Beng, who is in charge of the PCF\'s Kindergarten Committee, was\nresponding to some parents\' views in The Sunday Times.\n\n\nSome parents had said that they were anxious to enrol their chidden\nin nurseries so that the toddlers can make friends and study.\n\n\nMany were working parents who did not like the idea of leaving the\nmaids to teach their children.\n\n\nThey felt that maids should only feed and wash their kids.\n\n\nSome said that having children in the PAP-run nurseries would help\nthem score better when they entered primary school.\n\n\nDr Beng said: " I would like to stress to parents that they should\nnot expect a rigid curriculum.\n\n\n" Parents should also not expect their children to write or do\nhomework.\n\n\nHomework and tests may turn a child off." To help the young minds,\nthe centres had cut the three-hour sessions to two hours, he said.\n\n\nDuring these sessions, children are taught language skills, not\nthrough writing but by speaking and listening.\n\n\nChildren are taught to sit still and listen during story telling\nsessions.\n\n\n" If the child\'s attention span is short, he will not be adequately\nprepared for Primary 1," Dr Beng said.\n\n\nHis advice: " I\'ll not say that if a child misses out on nursery, he\nwill not go to the university.\n\n\nEach parent has to decide what\'s best for his child." \n\n\n\n\n Parents rush to enrol toddlers in nursery school \n\n\n More places planned in PCF-run pre-schools \n\n\nBy M.\n\n\nNirmala\n\n\nKINDERGARTENS run by the PAP Community Foundation ( PCF) are seeing a\nrush of toddlers some as young s 18 months being enrolled for classes.\n\n\nThis has prompted the kindergartens to plan for more nursery places.\n\n\nDr Arthur Beng, chairman of PCF\'s Kindergarten Committee, told The\nStraits Times: " We have observed the trend that parents want to send their\nchildren to nurseries." He said that the foundation was trying to provide\nnursery places and train nursery teachers.\n\n\nNursery facilities are now available at about 150 kindergartens out\nof the 240 PCF-run kindergartens.\n\n\nBut, the foundation\'s priority, he said, was to build more\nkindergarten classes to help prepare pupils for primary education, he said.\n\n\n" Missing a nursery year is not as crucial as missing kindergarten,"\nhe said.\n\n\nThe Punggol ward in Cheng San GRC had a taste of the " nursery rush"\nrecently at a registration exercise at its education centre in Block 414,\nHougang Avenue 10.\n\n\nWhen the 45 places available were filled, some angry parents who had\nqueued overnight started shouting.\n\n\nOne mother kicked a door and punched the windows.\n\n\nThe police had to be called in.\n\n\nExplaining what happened, the ward\'s MP, Dr Michael Lim, told The\nSunday Times that several parents refused to switch to a nearby centre which\nhad vacancies.\n\n\nDr Lim said: " What happened that day was unfortunate." He and his\nstaff had seen this new demand for nursery places coming, he said.\n\n\nOne kindergarten class was converted into a nursery class, creating\n45 more places to prepare for the second registration phase.\n\n\nHe said that about 45 parents on the waiting list were later given\nplaces in the four other centres in Punggol.\n\n\nTo cater for future demand, Dr Lim said, there are plans to build a\nnew pre-school centre in 1995, bringing the total in his ward to six centres\noffering 2,300 nursery and kindergarten places.\n\n\nOf the six, one is run by the People\'s Association while the rest are\nrun by the PCF.\n\n\nChildren between 18 months and three years old attend nursery classes\nbefore starting kindergarten classes at the age of four.\n\n\nPCF-run nurseries offer four two-hour nursery sessions a day.\n\n\nParents pay from\n&dollar;360 a year at a PCF-run centre to\n&dollar;6,480 at private centres.\n\n\nDr Lim said that there was more demand for nursery places because\nyoung couples now make up about half of the 19,000 Punggol estate households.\n\n\nThe emphasis on education is one reason.\n\n\n" Nobody wants their child to be left behind," he said.\n\n\nSeven private child care centres and nurseries also say they see a\ngrowing demand for nursery places.\n\n\nThey could not give figures but said they were receiving more calls\nasking specifically about nursery facilities.\n\n\nMrs Yap Siow Kuan, Head Child Care Operator at Kinderland Educare\nServices, said more parents are now asking if nursery places will be offered\nin their estates.\n\n\nA spokesman from the NTUC Child Care Co-operative said that feedback\nfrom its 17 child care centres showed that parents wanted music and movement\n- a component of a nursery programme to be taught.\n\n\nA Ministry of Community Development spokesman said that some of the\n285 child care centres offer nursery facilities.\n\n\nOthers could follow suit.\n\n\nThey only need to inform the ministry about the nursery facilities\nbeing offered, said the spokesman.\n\n\nParents opting for shorter hours of nursery schools WITH toddlers\nbeginning school so early, parents are opting for nursery schools which offer\nshorter hours, instead of the usual half- or full-day care at child care\ncentres.\n\n\nParents prefer shorter hours because younger children adapt better to\nthem, said several of the 10 mothers and fathers interviewed.\n\n\nThey are also sending them to play school early because tiny tots\nwith nursery training socialise better and have strong scores when they enter\nprimary school.\n\n\nThe parents\' main aim in sending their children to nursery schools\nwas to help the young ones make friends and learn to be independent.\n\n\nAlmost all of them were working parents and did not like the idea of\nmaids teaching the youngsters.\n\n\nMaids should only help wash, feed and look after the children they\nsaid.\n\n\nMr Khong Mun Pew, 35, a civil servant, said he pulled his first son\nout of a child care centre when the boy started throwing tantrums at the end\nof the day.\n\n\n" He didn\'t have his toys and brothers to play with the whole day, so\nhe didn\'t like the full-day programme." His son adjusted well when he went on\na three-hour programme, and Mr Khong plans to put his two other sons aged two\nand 16 months old, into a similar programme.\n\n\nMrs Brenda Yeo, 35, a secretary with two sons, aged two and one, is\nanother parent who believes in an early start.\n\n\nShe said: " When I was six months pregnant, I began calling nurseries\nto book a place.\n\n\nThey told me to come back after my son turned one."\n\n\nShe wants her sons to go first to a nursery school which emphasises\nlearning through play.\n\n\nAfter one year, her sons will attend a nursery school where the\nsyllabus emphasises learning the alphabet, numbers and Mandarin.\n\n\n" This will help them adjust well to a structured syllabus in Primary\nOne.\n\n\nThey will also score well.\n\n\n" People can say I\'m kiasu, but as a parent I only want the best for\nmy children." Are such parents putting too much pressure on their toddlers?\n\n\nAll the parents agreed with Mrs Bertilla Watanabe, 32, a copywriter,\nwho felt her two-year-old son would benefit from having more friends to play\nwith.\n\n\n" It would be cheaper for me to keep him at home.\n\n\nI could save\n&dollar;340 a month," she said.\n\n\nMrs Jenny Chan, 38, a clerk, said that to cut costs she sent both her\nsons to a PAP Community Foundation education centre near her flat in Yishun.\n\n\nShe is happy with the fees of\n&dollar;30 and the more formal Mandarin and mathematics lessons.\n\n\nMrs Yuhidar Abdullah, 28, however, has found that Mother is still\nbest.\n\n\nShe quit her teaching job to look after her sons, aged three and 1\n1/2.\n\n\nShe said that when she sent her elder boy to a nursery school to make\nfriends, he began protesting.\n\n\n" Maybe he was just too young when I sent him.\n\n\nHe wanted me to teach him at home and I have given in," she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n Growing demand for pork from Australia \n\n\nWith the scarce supply of live pigs, imports of chilled Aussie pork\nhave shot up since the virus outbreak.\n\n\n\n\nBy Tan Hsueh Yun and Wendy Tan\n\n\nPork from Down Under is making its presence felt on dinner tables\nhere.\n\n\nSuppliers have had to turn to chilled australian pork to satisfy\ncustomers, filling a vacuum left after live pig imports from Malaysia were\nbanned.\n\n\nSingapore imported about 87 kg of chilled pork a day in January, two\nmonths before the Nipah virus outbreak in March.\n\n\nIn april, the figure shot up to an average of 24 tonnes ( 24,000 kg)\na day. \n\n\nLast month, it went up to 29 tonnes daily, the Primary Production\nDepartment ( PPD) said.\n\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES, JUNE 30 1999', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '6fe6a751-9fde-4675-97c9-da664fdca995', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.808530+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9820155501365662, 'non_english_score': 0.017984449863433838}
{'text': 'Companies offered in-house psychiatric therapy service \n\n\nby Tan Yong Meng\n\n\nIS THERE a psychiatrist in the house?\n\n\nCompanies would be able to say yes to this question if they take up an\nin-house counselling and psychiatric therapy service now on offer.\n\n\nErnst and Young Consultants is selling this service as part of a\nwellness programme to companies in the banking and financial services, public\nrelations and electronic manufacturing.\n\n\nSaid one of the architects of the programme, executive consultant\nCatherine Sim: " Our targets are our existing clients, mostly MNCs.\n\n\nQuite a few have expressed interest in it."\n\n\nErnst and Young Consultants provide management consultancy services to\nboth public and private hospitals here.\n\n\nSaid Dr Alison Tan, the other executive consultant in the scheme: " We\nhave a vast network of professionals medical doctors, psychiatrists, family\ntherapists and counselors." Employees who have problems coping with family\nresponsibilities, or, are going through a mid-life crisis, or are just plain\nfed up with work, can get advice from in-house counsellors and psychiatrists\nif their companies subscribe to the service.\n\n\nThe wellness programme is designed to improve employees\' total\nwell-being.\n\n\nProfessional counselling is one of a 10-module package covering\ntopics like jobstress management strategies and retirement planning.\n\n\nMiss Sim explained: " We\'ll have an on-site counsellor at the company\npremises for a few sessions a week.\n\n\n" Whoever needs counselling can just make an appointment to see the\ncounsellor or psychiatrist in their company premises."\n\n\nFirms can also choose instead to have a list of appointed counsellors\nin private practice or employees to visit, she added.\n\n\nThe counsellor may be a social worker, psychiatrist, a clinical\npsychologist or even a family therapist.\n\n\nThe first 45 minute session costs between\n&dollar;80 to\n&dollar;120. \n\n\nSubsequent sessions of between half an hour and 5 minutes range\nbetween\n&dollar;5O to\n&dollar;90. \n\n\nCompanies which subscribe to the service can either bear the\nfull cost, subsidise it, or make the service part of a flexible benefits\nsystem.\n\n\nUnder such a system, employees can pick from a buffet of benefits\nwhich could include professional counselling.\n\n\nMiss Sim said: " Our immediate target are those in middle management\nwho may be more aware and receptive to such help.\n\n\nAt the lower levels, we\'ll start with physical health awareness\nfirst, then proceed to mental health." Right now, some big companies here\nalready have some form of employee wellness programmes.\n\n\nPharmaceutical company Johnson and Johnson\'s " Live For Life"\nprogramme focuses on a healthy lifestyle in the work place.\n\n\nOther companies like Great Eastern Life and NTUC Income also adopt\nthe same programme for their employees.\n\n\nHewlet Packard has a four-year-old programme covering areas like\nhealth education and stress management.\n\n\nBut no company is believed to have an in-house professional\nCounselling service yet.\n\n\nMr Suprabim Bose, managing director of Johnson and Johnson, said: "\nWe provide only outside counselling.\n\n\nAs of now, we haven\'t got into a situation that requires an in-house\nservice."\n\n\nMiss Prema Govindan, the Wellness programme manager at Hewlett\nPackard, added: " The employee support programmes we have at the moment are\nsufficient.\n\n\nl don\'t see a need for it at this point." In-house counselling as\npart of an Employees Assistance Programme has proved very useful in the US,\nsaid Dr Y C.\n\n\nLim, a consultant psychiatrist in private practice, who has worked in\nthe United States.\n\n\nHe said: \'There, problems of alcohol and drug abuse are quite\nrampant.\n\n\nCounselling has proved useful as a preventive strategy for companies.\n\n\nIt\'s also quite cost effective in the long term." But will it catch\non here?\n\n\nMiss Sim is optimistic.\n\n\nShe said: " We\'re anticipating the need for it.\n\n\nPeople will became more receptive to it with increasing awareness."\n\n\n\n\n\n No defects in tape that ran out, says Konica \n\n\n NTSC signals take up more space, hence the shortfall \n\n\nBy Tan Yong Meng\n\n\nTRY recording a two-hour movie from a laser disc onto a two-hour\nvideo tape and the video tape will run out before the movie ends.\n\n\nNot many people know this, and video tape manufacturers do not carry\nany warnings about it on the cover of their tapes.\n\n\nThe tapes will run out because most laserdisc movies available here\nuse the NTSC format an American colour-scanning system which has a faster\ntape running speed than the PAL system which is used here.\n\n\nThe NTSC system is used by countries like the United States, Taiwan,\nthe Philippines and Japan.\n\n\nThe PAL system is used in Britain, Hongkong, Singapore and Malaysia.\n\n\nA third system, Secam, is used by some European countries like France\nand Russia.\n\n\nLawyer Goh Kok Yeow, 32, found out that recording NTSC-format movies\nuses more tape when he tried recording a laser-disc movie with a Konica VHS\nE-l20 tape on his multi-system video recorder, which can record and play back\nmovies in the NTSC mode.\n\n\nAn ordinary video recorder cannot do that.\n\n\nBut when he later used the same tape to record a two hour TV movie,\nthe 120 minute Konica tape ran out before the movie ended.\n\n\nThe irate Mr Goh called The Straits Times, which then tested four\nKonica tapes.\n\n\nOne was found to be only 109 minutes long, 11 minutes short of the\nstated 120 minutes.\n\n\nThis tape, together with Mr Goh\'s were handed over to Konica\nSingapore which then sent them to Japan for more tests.\n\n\nThe results, according to its general manager, Mr Arthur Ting, showed\nthat the two tapes were not defective.\n\n\nMr Ting said: " Lengthwise, the tapes are fine.\n\n\nWe measured them, and both meet the standards." One tape was 173.33\nmetre long, while the other was 173.18 m.\n\n\nThe standard length for a two-hour tape, according to Mr Kazuyuki\nYamamoto, the assistant to the managing director, is 173 m.\n\n\nManufacturers usually could give an extra of up to 0.33 m.\n\n\nMr Goh\'s tape ran short because tests showed that both PAL and NTSC\nsignals were in it.\n\n\nFor the same duration, NTSC signals take up more tape space than PAL.\n\n\nThe combined length for both the NTSC and PAL signals added up to\n174.61m on the tape, longer than the maximum 173.33.\n\n\nThe total recording time on the other hand, is only 101 minutes, 19\nminutes short of the 120 stated on the tape.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, users can buy multi-system video recorders\nwhich have a long-play mode.\n\n\nThis will more than double the recording time of a video tape, but\nthe quality, according to Mr Yamamoto, is not as good.\n\n\nAs for The Straits Times\' tape, Mr Yamamoto said there were no PAL or\nNTSC signals on it to determine its running speed.\n\n\nHe attributed this to a possible fault in the video recorder that was\nused to record TV programmes on this tape.\n\n\nKonica added that it has proper quality control systems for its tapes\nand it tries its best to make sure its products are in good condition.\n\n\nBuyers want warning label, tape makers see no urgency.\n\n\nIF PAL video tapes can record only 70 per cent of a programme in the\nNTSC format, why not stick a label on them to warn customers?\n\n\nFive tape manufacturers who spoke to The Straits Times felt that\nthere is no need because people who record from NTSC-format laser discs are\na minority, although several customers felt otherwise.\n\n\nA spokesman for TDK said: " We have had no complaints from our\ncustomers so far." Kodak said it has not encountered such problems either.\n\n\nNational Panasonic, Sony, Kodak and TDK also said they will consider\nadding the relevant information only if more consumers demand it.\n\n\nKonica\'s managing director Yasuji Nakaone said: " We\'ll consider it\nif the need arises." Added Konica\'s general manager, Mr Arthur Ting: " We\ndon\'t want to confuse our customers with too much information on the tape\ncover." But several customers disagreed.\n\n\nSaid shop assistant Karen Lim, in her twenties: " We\'re not so\nstupid.\n\n\nIf they explain it clearly and print the instructions clearly, it\'ll\nhelp." Lawyer Goh Kok Yeow, 32, whose complaint started the check on Konica\ntapes added " I don\'t think such information will confuse.\n\n\nA table showing the differences will definitely be very useful for\nconsumers like me." A spokesman for Asia Matsushita Electric, which\ndistributes the National Panasonic tapes, said there is a shift from TV\nrecording to laser disc dubbing and additional information may become\nnecessary." \n\n\n\n\n Muscling through with looks and brains \n\n\nBy Geraldine Kan\n\n\nWHAT are a doctor, banker and engineer doing sauntering around in\ntheir swimming trunks?\n\n\nClue: They are not going for a dip.\n\n\nThe three are part of a growing number of professionals taking part\nin the quest for the ultimate man the Manhunt pageant.\n\n\nAll three are finalists in the contest.\n\n\nThe doctor, former Anglo-Chinese School student Rohan Mendis, 25,\nentered because he wanted to keep up the ACS spirit of doing the\nunconventional.\n\n\nBanker Kenneth Tan, 25, from rival school St Joseph\'s Institution,\nwanted glamour.\n\n\nAnd engineer Timothy Wang, 27, from St Gabriel\'s Secondary School,\njust wanted to expand his social circle.\n\n\nSaid Ms Mallika Joseph, the public relations manager for the contest\norganisers, Metromedia Marketing: " A few undergraduates and professionals\nhave been getting into the finals, and this has attracted more of their peers\nand has given Manhunt more respectability." When the pageant began as a male\nmodel search in 1988, it attracted only 90 contestants - mostly students and\nnational servicemen.\n\n\nAbout 45 of this year\'s crop of more than 300 are professionals.\n\n\nThe men, aged between 17 and 27, are judged on how they look in\nswimwear to assess their physique, and in evening wear to rate their fashion\nsense and poise.\n\n\nThe judges also interview them to gauge their personalities.\n\n\nThe finals of the contest will be held on June 25 at the Orchard\nHotel.\n\n\nTwo years ago, a senior manhunt segment was added for men above 28.\n\n\nBank manager Joseph D\'aranjo, last year\'s senior manhunt winner, is\nquick to point out that this is not a competition for male bimbos.\n\n\n" It doesn\'t just depend on your looks," said the 33-year-old.\n\n\n\'You have to be able to conduct a decent conversation, be logical and\ncurrent on world events.\n\n\nLast year, the judges asked me about the impact of the Earth Summit\nin Rio de Janeiro." And yes, the doctor, banker and engineer look after their\nbrains as well as their bodies.\n\n\nThe three, avid sportsmen, also make sure they keep up with their\nreading.\n\n\nDr Mendis, who is currently working at the Jurong Polyclinic, likes\nRoald Dahl\'s books for their wit and humour.\n\n\nHe also likes the animated movie Aladdin for the same reason.\n\n\nMany people, he said, centre their lives around their jobs.\n\n\nHe would rather keep himself open to new experiences.\n\n\n" Life," he said, breaking into a shy smile, " should not be taken\ntoo seriously." \n\n\n\n\n Forge proof NDP tickets \n\n\nThis year\'s National Day Parade tickets will come with security\nmeasures to prevent counterfeiters from scanning or photocopying them.\n\n\nAlthough no one has been caught with fake NDP tickets so far, the\norganisers said the features were meant to deter potential forgers.\n\n\nThey were concerned because last year, some people offered to sell\ntheir free tickets for\n&dollar;100 over the Internet.\n\n\nAt a briefing yesterday, Brigadier-General Andrew Tan, chairman of\nthe parade\'s executive committee, said that this year, the venues for\ndistributing the tickets would be made known only on July 9, two days before\nthe counters open on July 11.\n\n\nThis is because organisrs do not want people to camp at the venues\ndays before the distribution date.\n\n\nEach person can collect either two tickets for the National Day\nParade on Aug 9 or four tickets for the preview on July 31.\n\n\nAbout 56,000 tickets will be available for each day.\n\n\nBut the committee is looking to increase the seating capacity by\nadding more portable rows of seats on both sides of the sheltered VIP seats.\n\n\nThis wil allow a few thousand more spectators into the stadium.\n\n\nApart from the usual goodie bag, ticket-holders will be given a\ncommemorative MRT card which will give them free rides to and from the\nparade. \n\n\nBrig-Gen Tan encrouaged spectators to dress in the national red and\nwhite colours, which will be indicated on their tickets, during the parade.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'aef61763-045c-43e6-af11-8235dd1f0a52', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.809683+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9695122838020325, 'non_english_score': 0.03048771619796753}

SCHEME \n\n\n\n1) I am pleased to inform staff that the Hospitalisation, Surgical\nand Maternity Insurance Scheme underwritten by the Netherlands Insurance\nCompany will be renewed for another year from 1 January 1993, details of\nwhich are indicated below.\n\n\n\n2) I should be grateful if Heads would draw this circular to the\nattention of all staff in the Department.\n\n\n\nStaff can submit Photocopied application form at Appendix ( C).\n\n\n\n3) This Scheme, once signed on, becomes an automatic renewal scheme,\nwhereby annual premiums will be automatically deducted from the staff\'s\nsalary in January of each year and the staff covered for the duration of that\nyear, until the staff decides and inform the Personnel Department, in writing\nin December of each year to discontinue from coverage by the scheme for the\nfollowing year or the staff leaves University service, whichever is earlier.\n\n\n\nThe staff himself cannot prematurely terminate his policy before the\nend of the year.\n\n\n\n4) The Scheme is designed to top up existing hospitalisation\nbenefits provided under the University\'s Medical Services Scheme.\n\n\n\nIn this connection, the medical insurance scheme seeks to cover\nhospitalisation expenses, otherwise not payable under the University\'s\nMedical Services Scheme, as follows.\n\n\n\n( a) Staff members\' share of the ward charges ( 20%) and that of\ndependants\' share ( 50%) up to SGH Pte Ltd rates ( as at 31 December 1992).\n\n\n\nAs NUH Pte Ltd and private hospitals charge more than SGH, staff\nwill still have to bear a portion of the charges.\n\n\n\n( b) In regard to hospitalisation surgical treatment expenses in a\nprivate hospital, the difference between private hospital and SGH Pte Ltd\nrates will be payable subject to the limits spelt out in the Government\nPrivate Hospitals Plan.\n\n\n\n( c) Accouchement fees not payable under the University\'s Medical\nServices Scheme will be claimable under the Maternity Benefits Cover, in\naddition to ward charges.\n\n\n\nBenefits under this Cover will be extended to include reimbursement\nof pre-natal and postnatal consultation fees ( excluding medications etc) in\nexcess of University subsidy, the limits being the savings from the unused\nportion of the limits under " DELIVERY FEES" in the Medical Benefits Plan Med\n02/93.\n\n\n\nStaff not under the Maternity Benefits Cover cannot claim for ward\ncharges incurred on confinement.\n\n\n\n( d) The scheme also provides coverage to dependants who will be\nautomatically excluded from the University\'s Medical Services Scheme, upon\nreaching the age of 18.\n\n\n\nCoverage in this connection will be granted to dependant unmarried\nchildren from the age of 18 right up to 25 years, provided they can be\ncertified to be full-time students.\n\n\n\n( e) As an added benefit, the medical insurance scheme is applicable\non a world-wide basis.\n\n\n\nThe University\'s Medical Services Scheme on the other hand is\nconfined to Singapore only.\n\n\n\n( f) Benefits normally not covered by the University\'s Medical\nServices Scheme such as cosmetic surgery or restricted medical benefits will\nlikewise not be covered by this insurance scheme.\n\n\n\n5) Your attention however is drawn to the list of exclusion clauses\nspelt out in Paper Med 03193, that are applicable to the scheme.\n\n\n\n6) The insurance scheme is an optional one and staff members would\nhave to pay the premium if they decide to join the scheme.\n\n\n\nThis is an automatic renewal scheme and a one-time deduction of the\nannual premium will be made from salaries in January of each year for\ncoverage for that year as indicated in paragraph ( 3) above.\n\n\n\n7) Coverage will cease when a staff member leaves the services of\nthe University and a pro-rata refund of the premium will be made accordingly.\n\n\n\n8) All claims are to be made on prescribed forms obtainable from the\nPersonnel Department, and are to be sent direct to the Netherlands Insurance\nCompany by the staff member himself.\n\n\n\nAny disputes over claims with the insurance company will have to be\nresolved by the staff member himself and the University will not be involved\nin any way.\n\n\n\n9) Staff who are interested in the scheme should complete the\napplication form at Appendix ( C) and return it to me by 31 December

TRANSPORT CLAIM \n\n\nUnder existing rules, a staff member who performs duty enroute\nbetween his home and office and vice-versa may be paid duty transport\nallowance for the distance which is more than the distance between his home\nand office.\n\n\nThe reimbursement is currently based on the additional distance\ntravelled using the same mode of transport.\n\n\nFor example, if travel from home to place of duty, and from place of\nduty to office are both by taxis, the amount to be reimbursed would be the\ntotal taxi fares incurred for the 2 trips less the notional taxi-fare from\nhome to office ( even if the normal mode of travel to office is by personal\ncar).\n\n\nWith effect from 1 February 1993, a staff member who travels by taxi\nor other means of public transport to perform duty en route between his home\nand office, or vice versa, may be reimbursed the actual expenses for the\njourney less his normal expenses for commuting between his home and office.\n\n\nIf he uses his own vehicle for the journey, the present practice of\npaying him a transport allowance for the distance which is more than the\ndistance between his home and office, will continue.\n\n\nThe revised transport allowance claim form is attached for the use\nof staff in your department.\n\n\nIf you need any clarification on the above, please call Ms Tew Woon\nLing at extension 2407.\n\n\nR

31 July 1992\n\n\n TIMETABLES AND CLASSROOMS \n\n\nI have been receiving requests from some of you to change the time\nof your classes.\n\n\nI am sorry I have not been able to accede to most of the requests.\n\n\nThe problem lies with the venue.\n\n\nBecause of the increased student intake in recent years, the room\nsituation this year is particularly tight.\n\n\nSince the departments have not been able to give rooms for your\nalternative times, some of you have scouted around for rooms and suggested\nsome rooms.\n\n\nPlease note that the various academic departments have been\nallocated rooms in different blocks.\n\n\nFor example, the Mechanical & Manufacturing ( MM) Department has\nbeen allocated most of the rooms in Teaching Block 21, although the Business\nAdministration ( BA) Department and the Maritime Technology & Transportation\n( MTT) Department have two rooms each in that Block.\n\n\nThese rooms are for the exclusive use of the " owner" departments.\n\n\nWe cannot, therefore, hold a class for the BA Department in a\nclassroom allocated to the MM Department without the approval of the latter\nDepartment.\n\n\nAlso, the academic departments expect us to use the rooms given to\nus for Language classes.\n\n\nIf you have left your room vacant for a long time because you are\nteaching in a " better" room, the department will take the room for the use\nof its own staff.\n\n\nThis will then leave you in a dilemma when you are asked to leave a\nroom which you have been using illegally.\n\n\nPlease, therefore, refrain from using any vacant room you see\nbecause you run the risk of being asked to leave the room.\n\n\nI would appreciate it if you could keep to the times and rooms given\nto you.\n\n\nMany thanks.\n\n\ncc Chee Hian\n\n\nKim

commitments, the University has proposed that the following course of\naction be taken:\n\n\n ( 1) Teaching Workload \n\n\n( a) When staff members are away on reservist training, arrangements\nshould be made for their teaching duties to be covered by staff members who\nare non-reservists, as far as possible.\n\n\nReservists should only be asked to undertake make-up lectures on\ntheir return if there are insufficient staff in their area of expertise.\n\n\n( b) With reference to the teaching duties of staff members for each\nterm/year, the overall teaching load of staff members who are reservists may\nbe reduced to some extent in those cases where their teaching duties cannot\nbe covered by other staff members during their reservist training.\n\n\n ( 2) Holiday Leave during term-time  Flexibility will be\nexercised to allow staff members whose reservist training fall during\nvacation periods to take leave during term time, subject to exigencies of\nservice.\n\n\n ( 3) Annual Review for promotion/salary adjustment  The\ncurriculum vitae ( cv) form that staff members have to update each year will\nbe amended to enable details of any reservist training undertaken in the year\nof assessment to be included.\n\n\nThis is to facilitate proper records being kept and for the\nEstablishment Committee to give allowance, where necessary and appropriate,\nto any reduced output in research and publications from such staff members.\n\n\n( As the curriculum vitae form for the October/November 1990 Review\nhas already been sent to staff members, please note that this change will\nonly be reflected in the cv form for the April/May Review in 1991).\n\n\n2) I should be grateful if Heads of departments would note the above\nfor appropriate action.\n\n\nOng Jin Soo (

{'text': 'In Search Of Singapore\'s National Values \n\n\ned Jon S T Quah\n\n\n The New Environment, The Young Singaporeans and National Values\n\n\n\nZainul Abidin bin Rasheed & Arun Mahizhnan\n\n\n CHAPTER 6 \n\n\nIt has been said that in order to see the future one should look at\ntoday\'s young.\n\n\nLooking at the young in Singapore today, one would have mixed feelings\nabout the future, if the standards of the old are to be applied.\n\n\nThe Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, surprised everyone, young and old,\nwhen he said in November 1988 in Australia that he was not sure if " this\nman-made article called Singapore" would still exist in a hundred years.\n\n\nAbout six months later, in an interview on the BBC World Service, he\nagain expressed his worry about the country\'s long-term future.\n\n\nHe said: They ( the younger generation) think they have all the\nfreedom of choice now of a mature, developed society.\n\n\nI do not believe that.\n\n\nAnd they will discover it to be so.\n\n\nMy problem is that the tide is still against us, and a younger\ngeneration believes it isn\'t.\n\n\nBut I know it is.\n\n\nBut why the gulf?\n\n\nThe younger generation is but a product of a successful older\ngeneration.\n\n\nKernial Singh Sandhu and Paul Wheatley, the editors of the\nrecently-published Management of Success: The Moulding of Modern Singapore,\nended their book by stating that " the fundamental issue facing Singapore in\nthe years ahead will be not only how to achieve success but even more\nimportantly how to manage it once achieved".\n\n\nThey also expressed their doubts " how long a demographically\nyouthful, affluent, well-educated, globally-informed, travelled,\nEnglish-speaking ( and therefore open to foreign influence) population will\nbe content with a centrally-managed, petitionary political culture largely\ndevoid of the give and take of practical politics".\n\n\nThe young have seen nothing more serious than the economic recession\nof 1985 which the present government managed to turn around fast - apparently\nto the regret of some older generation leaders.\n\n\nFor them it was a missed opportunity to let the younger generation\ntaste the kind of hardships they had experienced.\n\n\nThe founding generation faced worse problems including the lack of\nresources yet they were able to harness their collective strengths and were\nable to build the unique Singapore that many young people now take for\ngranted.\n\n\nThe leaders have been quick to remind younger Singaporeans of the\nnation\'s vulnerabilities.\n\n\nSingapore\'s basic constraints - geo-political realities, geography,\nland, water, population, short history, lack of strong cultural roots and its\nmulti-racial, multi-religious constitution - all add up to a situation of\nsome fragility.\n\n\nIndeed, the Prime Minister has described Singapore as " a very\nunlikely country" in his National Day Rally speech in August 1987.\n\n\nHe quoted Rupert Emerson to show how formidable the task of\nnation-building can be and another American scholar, Professor Robert Tilman,\nto show how " geography, history, language, and culture have all conspired\nagainst the countries of ASEAN to make their task of nation-building and\neconomic development more difficult".\n\n\nThe process of nation-building may be formidable, but many in the\nyounger generation will object to any implied doubts about their calibre or\nability to cope with Singapore\'s potential problems.\n\n\nThey will say that, after all, men are products of their own times.\n\n\nIn a letter to the Straits Times, a young Singaporean studying at\nCambridge University wrote:\n\n\nToday\'s young Singaporeans are shaped by the successes of a modern\nnation as much as Mr Lee and his older colleagues were galvanised by the\nfailures of a falling colony.\n\n\nThe political generation gap is as difficult to close as it is to\nbridge the difference between a straight-laced mother and a fun-loving\ndaughter.\n\n\nIt is difficult, human nature being what it is, to expect a young\ngeneration brought up in a crisis-free era to inherit the crisis mentality\ncharacteristic of the Old Guard.\n\n\nHe added that while young Singaporeans can understand the constraints\nand vulnerabilities on the intellectual plane, there can be no empathy\nbecause they were never a part of those crises that brought home the sense of\nbeing on the knife-edge.\n\n\n DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT \n\n\nToday\'s young Singaporeans share a substantially different\nenvironment from the environment shared in their youth by people who are now\nin their forties and sixties.\n\n\nThose who are now in their sixties have faced and survived a world\nwar.\n\n\nThey waged an independence battle against colonial rule.\n\n\nLater, they fought the Communists and communalists and had to\nstruggle for economic survival after separation from Malaysia.\n\n\nThe period between the 1940s and the 1960s was turbulent and\ncrisis-prone.\n\n\nThe whole society seemed to be under siege by common threats from\ncommon foes.\n\n\nIn such circumstances the ethnic communities and different classes of\npeople were able to suppress their differences and rally to common causes.\n\n\nA fraternal bond was forged among them despite class differences and\nlittle understanding of each other\'s ethnicity.\n\n\nThe people as well as the leaders of that generation subscribed to\ncommon goals that were wrought out of common suffering and shared\nexperiences.\n\n\nThere was also another force that added impetus to this process the\nburning desire, especially among the immigrant communities, to do-well.\n\n\nIn his National Day message in 1989, the Prime Minister drew\nattention to the keenness and the spirit of Singaporeans which gave the\ncountry its competitive edge.\n\n\nHe said: This comes from our immigrant culture.\n\n\nOur forefathers had left their homelands to make good in a strange\nland and were determined to succeed, keen to achieve their best.\n\n\nThe determination to work hard and to achieve became a habit which\nthey passed on to their children.\n\n\nBut after the second generation, and more often, many years of\ncomfortable growth and prosperity, we have tended to take things for granted.\n\n\n THE NEXT GENERATION \n\n\nThose of the next generation, who are in their forties today, were\nwitnesses to, if not participants in, many of the historical developments of\nthe 1960s.\n\n\nThey also carried with them memories of an earlier era transmitted\nthrough their parents.\n\n\nThey were filled with the drive not just to survive but to succeed.\n\n\nThough they did not go through the trauma of a war or the political\nupheavals of a nationalist struggle, they did wrestle with the problems of a\nbleak and gravely uncertain economic future and the constant threat of\nCommunist and communalist undercurrents which burst out sporadically.\n\n\nStreet battles waged by the Communist and united front elements and\nsympathizers during the late 1950s and early 1960s are well documented.10\nMemories of the Maria Hertogh riots of 1950 my be vague and fading but\nmemories of the racial-religious riots of the 1960s certainly are not.\n\n\nScenes of hundreds of innocent Malays and Chinese being injured,\nmaimed or killed in the heat of the emotional turmoil are still vivid in the\nminds of many who were unlucky enough to be on the streets during the sudden\nand unexpected outburst of racial violence in 1964.\n\n\nSingaporeans of that generation know the price many had to pay for\nprimordial sentiments.\n\n\nBut it made them more determined to weld together disparate cultural\nand ethnic identities to form a recognizable and viable Singaporean image,\nwith racial and religious harmony as a cornerstone for future security and\nprosperity.\n\n\nThere is some question about whether this enthusiasm would have\nlasted long had Singapore\'s veteran politicians known what lay ahead.\n\n\nAs Lee Kuan Yew recalled in 1979: Although we knew it was going to be\na difficult task to create a better life for all, it was as well that we did\nnot realise how daunting were the problems of building a nation out of\npeoples of totally different races, languages, religions and cultures.\n\n\nI would be appalled if I am asked to start off all over again on 21\nNovember 1954 with the heavy knowledge of the almost irreconcilable divisions\nwhich were to open up.\n\n\nIn helping to build an independent, stable and prosperous nation,\nthis generation of Singaporeans was again largely united, focused and\npolitically cooperative.\n\n\nThe social glue was further strengthened by government initiatives in\npublic housing, bilingualism and National Service, as discussed in Chapter 4.\n\n\n TODAY\'S YOUNG SINGAPOREANS \n\n\nThose in their twenties and below today have grown up in a very\ndifferent Singapore and carry little of the mental or emotional baggage of\nthe previous generations.\n\n\nToday\'s young Singaporeans are the product of a rapidly modernizing\nand Westernizing environment.\n\n\nThey have grown up in a period when social and political changes were\nmanaged peaceably without the cathartic upheavals of the past.\n\n\nIt was also a period when sustained economic growth had brought about\na widespread feeling of economic well-being, even affluence.\n\n\nHowever, there was a negative side, identified in strong terms by Ho\nWing Meng.\n\n\nHe wrote: Increasingly, acquisitiveness has become the very soul of\nsociety, penetrating almost every aspect of social life and thought.\n\n\nEverything has a price attached to it, so much so that Singaporeans,\nespecially during the 1970s when the economy grew by leaps and bounds,\nappeared to be fast developing a system of values according to which the\nworth or significance of any person, object or activity was calculated\nexclusively in terms of his or its potential or actual pecuniary value.\n\n\nIt was the market value ( an expression which was used with\nincreasing frequency) of any person, his services or his goods in terms of\ndollars and cents which mattered most, and anything which was not reducible\nto such quantitative terms ( for example love, courage, honour, sacrifice,\nintegrity, selflessness, each with its irreducible qualitative wholeness) was\nlargely ignored or at best regarded with mild contempt.\n\n\nBut for all the negative factors of material success, the positive\naspects had added up to establish in the minds of the young a sense of\nsecurity and self-assuredness.\n\n\nAccording to Ho Wing Meng: By 1984, the government had become so\nconfident of its record of success through good planning and efficient\nadministration that Mr Goh Chok Tong, First Deputy Prime Minister, could\nunveil his \'Vision for Singapore by the year 2000\'.\n\n\nAccording to this vision, by the end of this century Singaporeans can\naspire to a standard of living comparable to that which the Swiss enjoy today\nprovided they maintain the pace of economic growth at between 6 and 8 per\ncent per annum over the next one-and-a-half decades.\n\n\nIt is expected that by then the per capita income of Singapore will\nhave grown to about USS 15,000.\n\n\nHowever, in order to attain this level of wealth Singaporeans will\nhave to release what Mr Goh describes as " a second burst of energy" through\nhard work, greater productivity, the development of higher skills, and the\nuse of higher technologies and methods of automation in industry.\n\n\n15 The same theme was taken up by Trade and Industry Minister Lee\nHsien Loong before senior civil servants and corporate chief executives at a\nNational Marketing Workshop in August 1989, when he said the new generation\nof Singaporeans had the resources and opportunities to transform Singapore\nonce again, just as the earlier generation had transformed it from a poor\ndeveloping country into a new industrializing economy.\n\n\nAccording to him, the challenge for the new generation is to sustain\nand build upon this success for another quarter century.\n\n\nSuch a rebuilding, in terms of the physical environment, education,\nhealth care, standard of living and personal fulfillment, depended on\ncontinued social cohesion, political stability, and economic growth and\nvitality.\n\n\nA glance at the Taiwanese experience is instructive in this context.\n\n\nChan Hung-Chih, author of the \'Index of Trends" wrote in 1989 that\nTaiwan\'s youth " no longer play the role of appendages to adults or schools;\nthey are now an independent group.\n\n\nTheir identity is nowhere more clearly defined than in their buying\npower".\n\n\nThe new consumerism in Taiwan has already prompted criticism of\ntoday\'s youth as materialistic and utilitarian.\n\n\nThe older generation, who experienced war, dislocation from homes,\nand extreme poverty, complain that young people lack the high aspirations\nthey had in their time, especially loyalty to country and the people. \n\n\nSingapore\'s sustained growth and the resultant feeling of economic\nconfidence also created a popular perception that there was room to " try\nsomething different".\n\n\nBut it was not an idea that created a commonality among those who\nsubscribed to it.\n\n\nThere were glaring differences between them, in their backgrounds\nand their process of socialization.\n\n\nWhereas the early Chinese were predominantly either Taoist or\nBuddhist or practised ancestor worship, more and more Chinese today have\nbecome or are becoming Confucianist or converting to Christianity.\n\n\nThere is a discernible trend among the Chinese to profess\nagnosticism as a preference.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL',

{'text': 'EDB ( 1992)\n\n\n Singapore - Your Global Business Architect \n\n\n Singapore : Strategic Economic Plan \n\n\nJudicious economic planning has characterised Singapore in its pursuit\nof growth and excellence since it gained self-government in 1959.\n\n\nThe plans set the priorities right by focusing on critical areas at\neach phase of economic development These have progressively transformed the\ncountry from an entrepot economy into a global city with capabilities in high\nvalue-added manufacturing and services industries.\n\n\nThe First Economic Plan, launched in 1960, concentrated on job\ncreation through industrialisation and the promotion of labour-intensive\nindustries.\n\n\nThe Second Economic Plan, developed in 1980, focused on raising\nproductivity to maintain Singapore\'s competitiveness, and on increasing the\npool of professional and technical manpower needed by industries.\n\n\nIn 1985, the Ministry of Trade and Industry\'s Economic Planning\nCommittee prepared the Third Economic Plan.\n\n\nThe main thrust was to sharpen Singapore\'s competitive edge for\nsustained economic growth.\n\n\nMeasures such as a flexible wage system and the promotion of the\nservices sector were recommended.\n\n\nAll three economic plans were highly effective in achieving their\nprimary aims.\n\n\n Vision For The 21st Century \n\n\nIn its continuing pursuit of growth and excellence, Singapore now\nintends to attain the status and characteristics of a first league developed\ncountry within the next 30 to 40 years.\n\n\nThese characteristics include economic dynamism and a high quality of\nlife.\n\n\nThe aspirations and the strategies for achieving the the goal are\ncontained in the Strategic Economic Plan developed in 1991 by the Ministry\'s\nEconomic Planning Committee.\n\n\n Strategic Thrusts \n\n\nSingapore has identified eight strategic thrusts for long term\neconomic growth.\n\n\nThese are: Enhancing human resources.\n\n\nUnder this programme, Singapore will increase the supply of the top\nechelon of talented and professional people.\n\n\nThis will ensure investors of an adequate pool of human resources to\nmeet their needs.\n\n\nThe new International Manpower Programme will attract more\ninternational talent to work in Singapore.\n\n\nPromoting national teamwork.\n\n\nChannels will be opened for business, labour and government to work\ntogether for better national performance.\n\n\nAt the higher level, an Economic Panel chaired by the Minister for\nTrade and Industry, with representatives from the public and private sectors\nwill discuss major economic issues of the key groups of the economy.\n\n\nAt the other level will be sectoral conferences to create a broader\nunderstanding within each sector of different perspectives and positions.\n\n\nSuch channels will provide investors with the opportunity to discuss\nother economic issues which have an impact on economic performance in the\nmedium- to long-term.\n\n\nBecoming internationally oriented.\n\n\nFor the past 30 years, Singapore\'s success has been based on tapping\nworld markets and global companies.\n\n\nIn the next lap of economic development, the country will go beyond\nthis by tapping global resources, technology and talent.\n\n\nTo achieve this objective Singapore will build up its capabilities in\nboth hard and soft infrastructure.\n\n\nCompanies will be encouraged to operate globally, investing in\nprojects that can generate economic spin-offs to Singapore.\n\n\nCreating a conducive climate for innovation.\n\n\nThe government will encourage companies and individuals to adopt\ninnovative ideas to increase business efficiency.\n\n\nSpecial precincts/districts such as the Science Park and the\nTechnology Corridor are available to provide a conducive and intellectual\nenvironment.\n\n\nFacilities for R&D work will be expanded.\n\n\nDeveloping manufacturing and service clusters.\n\n\nThe development of the core abilities of each cluster will have the\nadvantage of greater economies of scale and hence, more resilience to market\nconditions which may affect a particular industry.\n\n\nFourteen clusters have been identified.\n\n\nThese include precision engineering, electronics, information\ntechnology, petroleum and petrochemical, heavy engineering, general\nsupporting industries and international hub.\n\n\nA plan for each cluster will be formulated, in consultation with\nindustry and the relevant government agencies.\n\n\nSpearheading economic redevelopment.\n\n\nDomestic industries and businesses will be modernised, upgraded and\nmade more efficient to maximise their potential and enhance Singapore\'s\neconomic dynamism.\n\n\nLocal companies are encouraged to form strategic alliances to benefit\nfrom the economies of scale and management expertise.\n\n\nMaintaining international competitiveness.\n\n\nTo ensure that Singapore remains an attractive business location in\nthe Asia Pacific, information on short- to long-term competitiveness\nindicators will be compiled.\n\n\nA working group with representatives from the Ministry of Trade and\nIndustry, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Economic Development\nBoard ( EDB) will regularly review information on trends in competitiveness\nand make appropriate recommendations.\n\n\nReducing vulnerability.\n\n\nThis programme is to ensure a stable climate for companies to operate\nin.\n\n\nThe MNCs will be encouraged to use Singapore as a home base, rather\nthan just a business location, which is convenient and profitable in the\nshort term.\n\n\nLocal enterprises will be encouraged to develop to world-class\nstandards and provide a strong support base for the MNCs.\n\n\n IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SEP \n\n\nSingapore\'s past economic development strategies have stood the test\nof time.\n\n\nThe new strategies and initiatives in the SEP will guide the Republic\nthrough today\'s increasingly complex and competitive world business\nenvironment to its vision of tomorrow.\n\n\nIn its implementation, the Plan will be flexible and will be modified\nin accordance with the needs of prevailing economic situations.\n\n\nStrategic partnerships between companies and between countries are\nbecoming a global imperative in the advent of a " borderless" world.\n\n\nThese alliances, which harness their complementary strengths in a\nwide spectrum of business activities, enable companies and countries to\ncollaborate for mutual benefit and for collective competitiveness.\n\n\nAs the Asia-Pacific home of over 3,000 multinational companies (\nMNCs), of which 700 are in manufacturing, Singapore has forged strategic\nalliances with MNCs seeking business expansion in the region.\n\n\nIn its role as a global business architect, the Republic helps them\nplan their strategies to reconfigure and distribute their activities which\nwill capitalise business opportunities here.\n\n\n INTERNATIONAL BUSlNESS LINKAGES \n\n\nSingapore has widened its international business linkages.\n\n\nStrategic partnerships have been forged with several countries,\nincluding the United Kingdom, France and Hong Kong under a" Globalisation\nthrough Twinning" concept.\n\n\nCompanies in these countries are encouraged to identify specific\nbusiness opportunities which will bring mutual benefits to both parties.\n\n\nThese initiatives have opened the way for more business collaboration\nbetween companies in Singapore and in these economies, through cross\ninvestments and other activities.\n\n\nThrough its International Business Development Programme, the EDB\nwill facilitate overseas investment by Singapore companies for access to\ntechnology, markets and resources.\n\n\nThe initiative has resulted in a number of companies setting up\nbusinesses overseas in the United States, Europe and Asia.\n\n\n REGIONAL BUSINESS LINKAGES \n\n\nSimilar business linkages have been formed in Asia.\n\n\nThe most significant is the economic arrangement among Singapore, the\nRiau islands in Indonesia and Johor in Malaysia.\n\n\nThe rationale behind the move is to build on the complementary\nstrengths and capabilities of the three economies to provide the energy for\nfaster growth.\n\n\nWithin this Growth Triangle, investors can obtain the entire mix of\nresources such as sophisticated infrastructure, management and technical\nexpertise, labour and land to meet the requirements for expanding their\nregional distributed activities.\n\n\nEfforts to develop investment in projects utilising the complementary\nadvantages of the three regions are making good progress.\n\n\n TOTAL BUSCAPABILITIES \n\n\nOne of Singapore\'s competitive strength in its total business\ncapabilities in manufacturing and services, the twin engines of growth.\n\n\nLeading LNCs have expanded and diversified their spectrum of\nactivities here to include manufacturing, marketing, international\nprocurement, R&D, technical support, training, fund management and other\nservices.\n\n\nThe state-of-the-art technologies and expertise brought in by them\nhave heightened local competence and contributed to making the Republic an\ninternational total business centre.\n\n\nFor the next phase of economic growth, Singapore will enhance its\nindustrial and technology base through greater focus on research and\ndevelopment ( R&D ) in niche areas.\n\n\nWorking in partnership with international leaders in industry and\ntechnology, the Republic will build up its research, development and design\ncapabilities in these areas.\n\n\nThe process has already begun.\n\n\nTargets set up under the five year R & D blueprint ( the S&dollar;2 billion\nNational Technology Plan) are for total national R&D expenditure to reach 2%\nof the GDP by 1995 ( a minimum 50% private sector share of this total), and a\nratio of the number of scientists and engineers engaged in R&D activities of\n40 per 10,000 labour force by 1995.\n\n\n" The whole naion spells efficiency, productivity and reliability."\nMr John Fitzgerald, Vice President for the Asia-Pacific, United Parcel\nService.\n\n\nThe start of R&D in advanced microelectronic engineering at the new\nSS30 million Institute of Microelectronics ( IME) is a crucial step forward\nin the upgrading of the semiconductor industry in new areas such as\nsophisticated diagnostic tools, sub-micron IC technologies, advanced mixed\nsignal IC design and design methodology.\n\n\nTo further boost R&D activities in Singapore, three private and three\npublic organisations ( IBM Singapore is the largest shareholder in the joint\nventure) have set up a S&dollar;5 million commercial laboratory to conduct advanced\nIT ( Information Technology) R&D and leading edge solutions for the local and\ninternational markets.\n\n\nSince it started its economic development programme over 30 years\nago, Singapore has upheld its open-door policy.\n\n\nThe policy allows 100 % foreign ownership of companies, employment of\nforeign labour, tax-free imports and exports of raw materials, equipment and\nproducts, free movement of capital and repatriation of profits.\n\n\nThis pro-business attitude makes it easy for companies to start and\ndo business here.\n\n\nThe Government\'s pragmatic leadership has ensured political\nstability.\n\n\nIn addition, the harmonious tripartite relationship between\ngovernment, labour and employers has resulted in an enduring industrial\npeace.\n\n\nUnder this conducive operating environment, companies are free to\nfocus their attention on their business and implement their strategies\nwithout fear of disruption.\n\n\nSupport for business is also reflected in the close co ordination\namong the government agencies in Singapore to meet the needs of global\ncompanies.\n\n\n" Motorola decided to expand the Singapore operations because of the\nRepublic\'s excellent infrastructure, global airport, highly skilled\nworkforce, advanced education institutions, proximity to important customer\nbase and Motorola\'s excellent results and success during the past nine\nyears." - Mr Bob Becknell.\n\n\nVice President and Director of Far East Operations, Motorola\nEletronics.\n\n\n STRATEGIC LOCATION AND WORLD CLASS INFRASTRUCTURE \n\n\nSingapore\'s strategic geographical position in the Asia-Pacific\nallows easy access to the resource-rich region and fast distribution and\ntransshipment of goods, particularly for time sensitive items.\n\n\nMost major cities like Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, New Delhi\nand Sydney are within a six-hour radius of flying time.\n\n\nAll ASEAN ( Association of Southeast Asian Nations) capitals -\nBangkok, Bandar Sen Begawan, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Manila - are within a\ntwo-hour radius.\n\n\nSingapore\'s unique time zone and its sophisticated telecommunications\ninfrastructure enable companies here to conduct business with any part of the\nworld within a working day.\n\n\nToday, Singapore is ranked among the world leaders in\ntelecommunications, port facilities, air transport, power supply and road\nnetworks.\n\n\nThe state-of-the-art telecommunications services include direct dial\nlinks with some 180 destinations, a video-conferencing network covering 19\ndestinations, and tele-computer data access links with major databases in\nsome 60 countries.\n\n\nBoth the sea and airports are highly efficient and competitive in\nterms of services and are serving the needs of all types of businesses.\n\n\nSingapore\'s continuous investments to upgrade its infrastructure\nwill ensure that its facilities and services meet the changing and\nsophisticated requirements of businesses operating here.\n\n\nBusiness parks are being developed to meet the needs of modern\nbusinesses and high-technology industries setting up in Singapore.\n\n\nThese international business parks allow companies to integrate and\ncarry out their full range of activities including manufacturing, R&D and\ntraining, in one location.\n\n\nSingapore will continue to invest heavily in manpower development to\nenhance the quality of the labour force, rated the best in the world by\ninternational risk analysis firm, Business Environment Risk Intelligence (\nBERI) for more than a decade.\n\n\nIn its L992 Labour Force Evaluation Measure, BERI reported that\nSingapore\'s GDP per hour per worker of about US&dollar; 12 and wages averaging\nUS&dollar;3.20 per hour yield the world\'s highest relative productivity ratio.\n\n\nThe number of engineers available for industries here is growing.\n\n\nTo date, there are 29 research scientists and engineers per 10,000\nin the labour force.\n\n\nThis ratio will reach 40 per 10,000 labour force by 1995. \n\n\nThe National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological\nUniversity, polytechnics and training institutes currently produce about\n22,000 graduates and skilled craftsmen annually.\n\n\nFor knowledge-based industries, the AI Centre, set up with the\nassistance of the Japanese Government, will train 300 AI ( Artificial\nIntelligence) specialists over the next few years.\n\n\nThe number of r professionals will increase from the current 15,000\nto 30,000 by the year 2000.\n\n\nIn addition, MNCs operating in Singapore such as Glaxo, Sunstrand,\nYokogawa, Seiko, to name a few have participated in the national manpower\ndevelopment effort.\n\n\nFor instance, Glaxo contributed S&dollar; 50 million to the Glaxo-EDB\nHuman Resource Development Scholarship Programme and has a S&dollar;50 million joint\nR&D Programme with the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology of the\nNational University of Singapore.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '49b65d03-1f06-4cd0-8933-50f45d79f98f', 'added':

{'text': 'Renovation Guide For Homes Singapore Institute Of Architects "\nCalculating your Budget" \n\n\n Chapter Three \n\n\n Calculating Your Budget ESTABLISHING WHAT YOU WANT \n\n\nThe first consideration is to establish the extent of your renovation.\n\n\nA precise precise plan of your needs has to be drawn up so that\nmiscommunication between the contractor and you is reduced.\n\n\nContractors may interpret inaccurate information to their advantage.\n\n\nRenovation ideas can be sourced from friends, neighbours, magazines,\nshowrooms and exhibitions, interior designers, architects surveyors or\nbuilding surveyors.\n\n\nThese ideas can then be integrated with your basic requirements and a\nsketch plan with annotations, dimensions and scale can then be drawn.\n\n\nTogether with your detailed description of the work to be done, the\nscope of your renovation work can be identified.\n\n\nYour concept has then to be adapted to obtain planning permission and\napproval from the authorities.\n\n\nProfessional architects, surveyors and interior designers will be\nrequired to advise on the planning and the suitability and cost of materials\nand finishes that you want.\n\n\n ESTABLISHING A MAXIMUN And MINIMUM BUDGET \n\n\nEstablishing a renovation budget is important and when doing so, you\nhave to determine what are your sources of funds and what can be obtained\nfrom financial institutions.\n\n\nYou have to decide what percentage of your budget should be spent on\neach room and on floor finishes, wall finishes and ceiling finishes.\n\n\nMake an inventory of what is needed and fill in the prices which you\nare prepared to pay.\n\n\nYou can then tailor your available funds.\n\n\nA maximum and minimum budget has to be provided so that you have\nflexibility and reallocation of funds is possible should there be a change in\npriorities.\n\n\nThink of ways to use what you already have in order to maximise your\nbudget.\n\n\n CHECKLIST OF OVERALL BUDGET \n\n\nRenovation Cost\n&dollar; \n\n\nInterest Payments\n&dollar; \n\n\nProfessional Fees\n&dollar; \n\n\nFurnishings\n&dollar; \n\n\nContingencies\n&dollar; \n\n\n( Design changes, construction problems)\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n&dollar; \n\n\nTotal\n&dollar; \n\n\n BUDGETING GUIDE TO RENOVATION COSTS \n\n\nGenerally, there is a wide range of quality and prices for each type\nof material.\n\n\nFor example, the price of ceramic tiles may range from\n&dollar;30 to\n&dollar;80 sq metre and marble\n&dollar;120 to\n&dollar;300 sq metre including installation.\n\n\nPattern work costs more than plain work.\n\n\nSome types of wood, veneers and finishes for wardrobes and kitchen\ncabinets are in the high cost range.\n\n\nThus, you must work out your budget accordingly.\n\n\nSchedule of rates for renovation work: \n\n\nQty\n\n\nUnit\n\n\nRates\n\n\nFloor finish Parquet or timber flooring sq 1\n&dollar;30 to\n&dollar;60 Marble sq 1\n&dollar;120

several and check on their past performance with previous\nclients.\n\n\nCheck if the contractors kept within the budget.\n\n\nConfirm if the work was completed on time, whether they were\nsatisfied with the complete work and if there was supervision by the\ncontractors when the work was in progress.\n\n\nCheck if the contractors\' offices are not just answering machines.\n\n\nRemember each contractor must be given an identical specification and\nrenovation plan so that fair comparisons estimates is possible.\n\n\nIn addition, the contractors must conduct a thorough inspection of\nyour home.\n\n\nRemember that quotation is normally the contractor\'s best estimate as\nto how much the renovation will cost.\n\n\nBe cautious if the contractor suggest that prices are " subject to\nchanges".\n\n\nIt is necessary to put your agreement in writing.\n\n\nThe contract should certainly include the date, contractor\'s name,\nbusiness address and licence number.\n\n\nIn addition, there must be drawings, complete job specifications,\nstarting and completion dates, guarantees, liability coverage, and a clause\nto put the burden of cleaning up upon the contractor.\n\n\nThis is also covered in Chapter Seven and if you are employing a\nprofessional advisor these matters should be attended to on your behalf.\n\n\n CASH FLOW AND CREDIT LIMIT \n\n\nRemember to check the terms of payment before signing the contract.\n\n\nFor cash flow control record all your payments and monitor them\naccording to your Budget Checklist.\n\n\nMake payments at intervals while the work is in progress only as\nstated in the contract and if you are satisfied with the work done so far.\n\n\nIt is best to pay by cheque so that you have a record of payment.\n\n\nYou should insist on a receipt with the contractor\'s name, address\nand signature.\n\n\n VERIFYING ESTIMATES SUBMITTED \n\n\nDepending on the size of the job your professional advisor will\nsuggest you get at least 2 to 3 quotations for comparison.\n\n\nIn addition, the contractor should be required to break down the\nproject into components of work and unit rate.\n\n\nAn example of a simple house renovation estimate breakdown is as\nfollows: \n\n\n1 New Extension structural works floor slab floor finishes 2\nInternal painting wall ceiling 3 External painting wall 4 Kitchen cabinets\nlow cabinets m / m high cabinets m / m 5 Aluminium windows front windows side\nwindows 6 New flooring living room master bedroom bedroom 1 bedroom 2 toilets\n7 Electrical work wiring\n&dollar;/ point door bell new distribution board 8 Plumbing new pipe work fittings\nbathtub - type sinks - type WCs type \n\n\nBased on the detailed quotation, check with neighbours or friends who\nhave done similar renovation work.\n\n\nIn addition, if the work fairly large and you have engaged an\narchitect, interior designer or quantity surveyor, they will check the\nquotations with their records and advise you if the quotation is reasonable.\n\n\nIf you realise that you have exceeded your planned budget you may:\n\n\nGet the contractor to do part of the job and do the rest yourself.\n\n\nHowever, you will then have to coordinate the activities.\n\n\n· Modify your needs by substituting materials that cost less.\n\n\nSource relevant materials and adjust accordingly.\n\n\n· Prioritize your renovation work so that inessential items may be\neliminated until you have enough funds.\n\n\n· Schedule your work in several phases that cash flow is well\nmanaged.\n\n\nAn example would be, laying the tiles for a room and then furnishing\nit when more funds are available.\n\n\nYou have to assess the time that you have to complete your renovation\nproject.\n\n\nThus a target time frame has to be established and compared with\nsources of funds available within the time frame.\n\n\n Chapter Four \n\n\n Working With Professional Consultants \n\n\nWhich professionals you should employ depend on the scale of your\nrenovation.\n\n\nYou may need to work with an architect, an interior designer, a\nquantity surveyor, mechanical and electrical engineer, structural engineer,\nland surveyor and a specialist.\n\n\n ARCHITECTS \n\n\nArchitects are not only employed on commercial buildings and offices.\n\n\nSome specialise in domestic projects.\n\n\nYou will require their services especially in drawing up plans for\nthe statutory authority and obtaining planning permission.\n\n\n What Does An Architect Do? \n\n\n· An architect brings together within the project all the elements\nthat are required by the client, taking into consideration the client\'s\nlifestyle and preferences.\n\n\n· The architect deals with statutory authorities and obtains planning\npermission.\n\n\nSketches showing both the interior and exterior of the house are\nprovided for the client\'s approval before accurate drawings are submitted to\nthe relevant authorities.\n\n\nThe architect carries out the administration of the works from the\npoint of conceiving the project to the point where tenders are obtained.\n\n\nThereafter the architect checks the work on site and approves the\nhouse before it is handed back to the owner.\n\n\nThe architect acts as a quasi-arbitrator who professionally advises\nthe client and the contractor when disputes arise.\n\n\n SELECTING AN ARCHITECT \n\n\nReferrals.\n\n\nAsk your friends or neighbours who have used an architect and were\nsatisfied with the work for recommendations.\n\n\n Portfolios \n\n\nShop around and look at the architect\'s past record.\n\n\nDo you like his or her style?\n\n\nTalk to the architect\'s old clients.\n\n\n Conversing \n\n\nGet to know the architect in person through conversation.\n\n\nThis is very important.\n\n\nIf you find that you cannot communicate well with the architect at\nthis stage, it is likely that you will not be able to convey your ideas when\nthe project starts.\n\n\nSpend some time talking together and get a feel of how the architect\nworks.\n\n\nConsider whether the architect\'s style suits you.\n\n\nSingapore Institute of Architects.\n\n\nIf you cannot find an architect through personal recommendation or\nyou are not satisfied with the work of those architects you have seen, call\nthe Singapore Institute of Architects.\n\n\nThey will assist by channelling queries like this to the right\narchitect.\n\n\nThey will also send you upon request a list of names of architects\nwho specialise in the type of work you have in mind, or, you can always\nconsult a copy of the Institute\'s yearbook which lists the specialities of\nthe architects featured.\n\n\n What It Costs \n\n\nFees for architects vary according to the type of work and the\nextent of their involvement in your renovation work.\n\n\nThe Singapore Institute of Architects has laid down guidelines but\nthese are not mandatory.\n\n\nThe fees are mostly calculated as a percentage of the total building\ncost.\n\n\nThere are basically three levels of complexity to a job.\n\n\nThe first level is simple renovation, the second is slightly more\ncomplex work and the third, very complex work.\n\n\nRenovation work will fall in between one and two.\n\n\nIf the renovation work costs approximately\n&dollar;1 million, the guide provided by the Institute is about 8%.\n\n\nAnd if renovation is between\n&dollar;100,000 to\n&dollar;200,000, the fees will be between 6% and 9%.\n\n\nThe SIA does not permit fee-bid amongst its members.\n\n\n STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS \n\n\nA structural engineer is concerned with structural safety and\nstrength of a building.\n\n\nIn renovation, the structural engineer\'s role is to see that the\nexisting structure of a building is strong enough to support any additional\nload which may be required by the architect or the interior designer.\n\n\n What Does A Structural Engineer Do? \n\n\n· The structural engineer advises on foundations in areas where\nthere is likely to be subsidence.\n\n\nHe designs the main structural supports for your renovations.\n\n\n· The structural engineer prepares calculations and drawings for\nsubmission to relevant authorities for approval, calls for tenders and\nperiodically supervises building works.\n\n\n Selecting A Structural Engineer \n\n\nThrough Other Professionals.\n\n\nYou may have to engage a structural engineer on the recommendation\nof the architect or other professionals involved in the job.\n\n\nThis arrangement is advantageous as it permits architects or\nprofessionals to team up with someone they have worked with before.\n\n\nAssociation Of Consultant Engineers.\n\n\nApproach the association for a recommendation if you require the\nservices of a structural engineer.\n\n\nThe association will be able to supply you with names of members\nexperienced in handling domestic works.\n\n\n What It Costs \n\n\nThe fees vary with the type of work involved.\n\n\nAs a guide, work is usually charged on a percentage of the total\ncost of the job.\n\n\nThe range is between 2% to 3% of the total renovation cost.\n\n\n INTERIOR DESIGNER \n\n\nInterior designers are not always trained in building design but may\nhave acquired the necessary skill through practice.\n\n\nThe more qualified ones are able to organise internal space and have\nthe visual skill and imagination to make an exciting and comfortable\ninterior.\n\n\nThe less qualified ones are only able to advise you on how to choose\ndecorative finishes and may not understand the organisation of space which is\nfundamental to a comprehensive design.\n\n\n What Does An Interior Designer Do? \n\n\n· An interior designer advises on planning and reorgarusing of\ninternal spaces.\n\n\nThe designer makes sketches, prepares comprehensive colour charts\nand compiles samples of materials for all rooms to be renovated.\n\n\n· Assistance is given in the selection of fabrics, colour matching,\nfurniture and advice on storage and how to make best use of space.\n\n\n· The interior designer will call for tenders from builders,\ndecorators, upholsterers and electrical contractors.\n\n\n· The work on site is organised and periodically supervised.\n\n\nThe interior designer will check the progress of the project and\nassess the standard of work done.\n\n\n Selecting An Interior Designer \n\n\nShop Around.\n\n\nThere are several interior designers around.\n\n\nVisit these firms and ask to see their work in photographs and in\nreality.\n\n\nMake a comparison and decide on what style you prefer.\n\n\nReferrals.\n\n\nConsult your friends and get recommendations from them.\n\n\nConsult Interior Quarterly ( IQ) and Interior Digest ( ID) and other\ndesign magazines.\n\n\n What It Costs \n\n\nGenerally, the fees range from 10% to 15% of the total renovation\ncost.\n\n\nDesigners at the higher end of the market will only accept a\nrenovation with a budget of at least\n&dollar;150,000, but at the other end, there are designers who accept jobs with a\ntotal renovation budget as low as\n&dollar;50,000.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'From Garden To Kitchen \n\n\nby S K Lee\n\n\n 1 GROWING VEGETABLES IN SINGAPORE? \n\n\nGrowing of vegetables in one\'s own garden is a common hobby for many\nhouseholds in the west.\n\n\nIt is usual for housewives to harvest their own fresh potatoes,\ncabbages and other vegetables from their backyards for family consumption or\neven to give away to friends.\n\n\nOne may argue that such a hobby is only possible in the west where the\ncompounds of their premises are large and space can be allocated for the\nestablishment of a vegetable garden.\n\n\nExcept for a few fortunate households which have relatively large land\nareas, can we in Singapore indulge in such a hobby?\n\n\nThe answer is a definite \'yes\'.\n\n\nEstablishing a backyard vegetable garden does not require a big piece\nof land.\n\n\nYou can begin with a small area of about 5 m2 ( 1m by 5 m plot or any\nother dimensions).\n\n\nThis plot is ideally manageable for a hobbyist, whilst also adequate,\nto grow a reasonable amount of vegetables to satisfy part of the vegetable\nneeds of the family.\n\n\nThis means that such a plot can be established in the backyards of\nmost terrace houses, semi- detached houses and bungalows.\n\n\nEven in condominiums and HDB apartments, growing of some leafy\nvegetables may be possible at the balcony if a proper trough is installed and\nif there is adequate sunlight ( the trough with the vegetables must be\nexposed to the morning or afternoon sun for at least 4 to 5 hours a day).\n\n\nA fibre glass trough will be ideal as it is light and does not add\ntoo much load to the building structure.\n\n\nThe emphasis of this handbook, however is on the establishment of\nbackyard vegetable plots on landed properties.\n\n\nI am fortunate to have a compound house and the contents of this book\nare entirely based on my experiences of " farming" a backyard garden.\n\n\nAlthough you would still need to purchase various types of vegetables\nto satisfy everyday needs, it is a wonderful experience for you to be able to\ngo to the backyard to harvest your own vegetables; to wash and to cook them\nimmediately for the dinner table.\n\n\nOne can enjoy the real \'freshness\' from these fruits of one\'s labour.\n\n\nBesides, it keeps the gardener fit and healthy through the\nperformance of physical activities and the outdoor lifestyle associated with\ngardening.\n\n\nWhat then are the areas within the house premises which can be used\nfor the establishment of a vegetable plot without affecting the aesthetics of\nthe garden and other landscape features?\n\n\nSome of the possible sites that can be set aside for a vegetable plot\nare shown below.\n\n\nIf well maintained, such a vegetable plot can also serve as a\ndecorative feature within the house garden.\n\n\nCHILLI Scientific Name: Capsicum annuum L\n\n\n 1 Establishment of Plant \n\n\nThe common red chillies can easily be grown at a corner of your\nvegetable plot or within planting pots.\n\n\nTwo or three plants will be more than adequate for your kitchen\nneeds.\n\n\nBoth methods of cultivation require the initial sowing of seeds\nwithin a pot filled with a soil and compost mixture in the proportion of 2:1.\n\n\nThere is no need to specially purchase chilli seeds as those taken\nfrom red or dried chillies purchased from your wet market can be used.\n\n\nThe seeds are sown in pots and lightly raked into the soil.\n\n\nThe soil is then watered daily.\n\n\nThe seeds will germinate in a matter of 7 to 10 days.\n\n\nIf you want the chilli plants grown within the vegetable plot, the\nseedlings can be transplanted with the aid of a hand trowel about 5 weeks\nafter sowing.\n\n\nHowever, if it is intended to establish the plant in the pot, then\nthe other weaker seedlings should be thinned out and only the most sturdy\nones are left to continue their growth to maturity.\n\n\nManure the plants lightly ( about 5 g per plant) after the thinning\nprocess.\n\n\n 2 Management \n\n\nChilli plants are hardy and grow well either in the pots or within\nthe vegetable plot, especially if the soil is well manured.\n\n\nIn order to encourage branching of the plant so that more fruits can\nbe borne, the terminal buds of some of the branches should be nipped off.\n\n\nThe plants will begin to bear flower, about 1/2 months from the time\nof sowing.\n\n\nThe soil around the chilli plants should continue to be lightly\nforked with a hand fork to improve soil aeration.\n\n\nFor those chilli plants grown in a pot, some compost should be added\nto improve the quality of the soil to sustain good growth.\n\n\n 3 Pests and Diseases \n\n\nThe most common pest of chilli plants is the white fruit fly.\n\n\nThe adults normally reside on the underside of leaves.\n\n\nAs there are only a few plants, frequent inspection and removal of\nthe infested leaves may control the insect to some extent.\n\n\nIf the whole plant is heavily infested, it is advisable to remove the\nplant and dispose of it in a sealed plastic bag.\n\n\nThere should then be a short interval before another chilli plant is\ncultivated.\n\n\nAs there may only be one or two chilli plants, it would not be\nbeneficial to treat them with pesticides.\n\n\nAs for diseases, viral infection of the young leaves can be common.\n\n\nInfected leaves assume a smaller size than the normal leaves and they\nappear wrinkled and curled.\n\n\nBut the plant does not normally die.\n\n\nIndeed such symptoms can sometimes be masked with more intensive\nmanuring and improvement of the soil.\n\n\nTreated in this manner, the plants can still bear chilli fruits.\n\n\n 4 Harvesting \n\n\nThe first green fruit can be harvested about 3 to 4 weeks from\nflowering and if red chillies are preferred, the fruits will have to be left\nto mature on the plants.\n\n\nChilli plants will continue to produce an abundance of fruits for a\nperiod of 4 to 5 months if the are well maintained.\n\n\nBlTTER GOURD Scientific Name: Momordica charantia L\n\n\n 1 Establishment of Plant \n\n\nAs this plant is a climber, it needs space for its abundant vines to\ntrail healthily.\n\n\nWe should not grow more than two plants, otherwise they will be\ndifficult to manage.\n\n\nIt is suggested that 2 seeds be sowed at each end of the vegetable\nbed.\n\n\nThis is done by digging a 3 cm hole in the soil with the fingers, and\ncovering the hole with the soil after dropping in the seed.\n\n\nRemove 1 seedling if both seeds germinate at the two locations.\n\n\nThe seeds lie for about 7 to 8 days before germinating.\n\n\n 2 Management \n\n\nThe vegetable bed should be watered once a day and the bed is to be\nkept free of weeds.\n\n\nBeing climbing plants, they need the support of a netting.\n\n\nA simple netting can be woven using ordinary raffia strings.\n\n\nMesh size can be about 10 cm by 10 cm.\n\n\nOne side of the netting can be tied onto a fence ( if there is one\nadjacent to the planting bed) while the other can be supported by some wooden\nslats.\n\n\nThe bitter gourd plants will send out their tendrils ( climbing\nstructures) when they are about 18 to 20 days old and the young climbers will\nhave to be guided up the netting with the aid of a small stick.\n\n\nLightly manure ( about 20 g per plant) the plants by broadcasting\nsome granular fertilizers to boost their growth.\n\n\nThe plants are fast growing and they will soon cover the netting.\n\n\nShould the planting bed become compacted, lightly fork the soil,\nespecially around the collar of the plants.\n\n\nThe plants start to fruit about 45 to 50 days from the time of\nsowing.\n\n\nContinue manuring.\n\n\nAs the vines form a thick \'mat\' on the netting, weeds are suppressed\ndue to the lack of sunlight.\n\n\nHence, there is really very little to do in maintaining this plant.\n\n\n 3 Pests and Diseases \n\n\nNo serious pests and diseases are encountered except for some leaves\nbeing chewed up by ladybird beetles.\n\n\nThese can be left without need of treatment as the damage is minimal.\n\n\nThe occasional snails do not attack this plant at all, probably\nbecause the leaves may be too bitter!\n\n\n 4 Harvesting \n\n\nMany small gourds will appear at various axils ( where the leaves\nbranch out) along the vine.\n\n\nAs they grow, they will hang down below the netting.\n\n\nIt is indeed a beautiful sight to see the hanging gourds.\n\n\nThe gourds are ready for harvesting when they turn light green and by\nthis stage, the fruits may reach about 30 to 40 cm in length.\n\n\nTwo plants alone may yield some 25 gourds over a period of 6 to 8\nweeks.\n\n\nTo protect the fruits from being damaged by fruit flies which lay\ntheir eggs in the fruits, many growers do wrap their gourds with old\nnewspapers.\n\n\nWhile this may be slightly tedious, it is a precaution worth taking.\n\n\nThe netting used for supporting the plants can be saved for\nsubsequent use when the harvest is over.\n\n\n 5 Some Common Beliefs \n\n\nMany people shy away from planting bitter gourd because they are of\nthe notion that subsequent crops of other vegetables grown in the same place\nwill be bitterish in taste.\n\n\nThis is absolutely untrue.\n\n\nFrom my experience, lady\'s fingers planted after a bitter gourd crop\nproduce equally sweet and tender fruits.\n\n\nIV) BACKYARD FRUITS\n\n\nPAPAYA\n\n\nScientific name: Carica papaya L\n\n\nPropagating Material: Seeds\n\n\n Establishment and Management \n\n\nThe seedlings are normally grown in pots first.\n\n\nWhen they are about 15 cm tall, they can then be transplanted into\nyour garden.\n\n\nA planting hole about 1 m deep must be dug and backfilled with a\ngood quality top soil and compost mixture.\n\n\nIt would also be advantageous to add more of such soil mixture to\nform a mound about 30 cm in height over the planting hole.\n\n\nThis is to encourage surface drainage as papaya plants do not thrive\nin water-logged soil.\n\n\nThe seedlings should initially be manured with about 15 g of\nfertilizer per plant once a month, and this should subsequently be increased\nto about 30 g per plant monthly.\n\n\nA precaution though; fertilizer granules should not be applied too\nnear to its tree trunk as it may cause the stem to rot.\n\n\nA lot of variations do occur in papayas, hence seeds taken from a\nsweet fruit do not guarantee offsprings that can bear equally sweet fruits.\n\n\nLIME OR LIMAU ICASTURI\n\n\nScientific name: Citrus microcarpa Bange\n\n\nPropagating Material: Stem\n\n\n Establishment and Management \n\n\nGood quality grafted saplings can be purchased from the Primary\nProduction Department\'s demonstration farm at Lim Chu Kang.\n\n\nThe sapling can be planted either in a dragon jar filled with good\nquality soil/compost mixture or it can be planted in a prepared 1 m deep\nplanting hole.\n\n\nThe planting hole must then be backfilled with good quality soil/\ncompost mixture.\n\n\nThe sapling establishes itself rather fast and grafted ones normally\nstart to bear fruit early.\n\n\nThe plant must be frequently manured with about 20 g of fertilizer\nonce every 4 to 6 weeks to sustain its sturdy growth and a bountiful fruit\nproduce.\n\n\nThe plant is not susceptible to many pests or diseases, except the\noccasional blackish appearance of sooty moulds.\n\n\nSpraying with fungicides can prevent this problem.\n\n\nA lime plant can be a good source of fresh lime juice, to quench\nyour thirst or to give flavour to a variety of food.\n\n\nBANANA\n\n\nScientific name: Musa sp\n\n\nPropagating Material: Suckers\n\n\n Establishment and Management \n\n\nMany varieties of bananas are available for planting.\n\n\nThe selection depends on your preference.\n\n\nA sucker ( young soot growing from the base of a matured plant )\nplanted in a prepared 1 m planting hole can lead to the establishment of a\nvigorous clump.\n\n\nBanana plants grow better if the base is mulched with organic\nmaterials.\n\n\nThrough a bi-monthly application of 30 to 40 g of fertilizer, the\ncolony of banana plants can produce bunches of bright yellow harvests in due\ncourse.\n\n\nFor the clump to remain neat and aesthetically pleasing within the\nhome garden, all dry leaves should be removed. \n\n\nA common pest found in our garden is the banana leaf-roller, which\nis actually a caterpillar.\n\n\nThese caterpillars can be easily handpicked and then discarded.\n\n\nOne caution: bananas should not be planted on the same spot\ncontinuously as they may attract the build-up of diseases such as the Panama\nDisease.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'fa6888d2-b4cf-4ede-9189-4559d8d50998',

{'text': 'Local Enterpries Computerisation\n\n\nNational Computer Board\n\n\n Specifying your requirements \n\n\nBefore you can start building your computer system, you need to\nspecify your requirements.\n\n\nIn computer jargon, these requirements are called functional\nspecifications.\n\n\nThese are the " blue-prints" that are prepared to show exactly how the\ncomputer system is intended to function, and it is paramount that this first\nstep is done properly.\n\n\nBefore we go into the first step, a few preliminary comments are in\norder.\n\n\n Computerising Versus Automating a Manual System \n\n\nComputers and humans are different.\n\n\nYou cannot just look at what your manual system is presently doing,\nand automate that.\n\n\nYour manual system may be good for your existing needs because it is\ndesigned to take into account the strengths and weaknesses of people.\n\n\nIt may feature error prevention procedures ( eg double entry\naccounting) and contain opportunities for " fixes" and " creativity" ( eg\nspecial discounts for selected clients) and so on.\n\n\nA computer system must be designed to take into account the strengths\nand weaknesses of computers, and these are entirely different from those of\nhuman beings.\n\n\nFor example, computers never get tired, and never make mistakes on\nrepetitive tasks ( unless the program is wrong).\n\n\nHowever, computers cannot make judgements and may not be as flexible\nas humans are.\n\n\nThese differences demand new ways of looking at your operations so\nthat the computer system you are going to put in place will be appropriate\nand effective.  Can I Do It On My Own? \n\n\nDo not be tempted to purchase computers prematurely.\n\n\nConduct a thorough information systems requirement analysis with the\nassistance of an experienced analyst.\n\n\nIf you have no in-house computerisation expertise, and you do not\nwish to re-invent the wheel, it may be wise to engage the help of an IT\nconsultant.\n\n\nBut you have to be sure that this outside IT consultant has the\nspecialised skills, knowledge and experience that is appropriate for YOUR\nenvironment, as ultimately, the responsibility for the project is still\nyours.\n\n\nThe IT consultant should have a clear idea of the computerisation\nprocess and be able to guide you through the procedural steps discussed in\nChapter 3.\n\n\nFor a detailed discussion on the services of IT consultants, please\nrefer to Chapter 4 on " The IT consultant".\n\n\nThere are various technical and financial schemes available to\neligible local enterprises for computerisation.\n\n\nDetails of these are available in chapter 9 " Government Incentive\nSchemes."\n\n\n Are the Right People Involved? \n\n\nFor your computerisation project to be successful, you must ensure\nend-user involvement.\n\n\nEnd-users are the people who would ultimately use the system.\n\n\nThe end users are probably the best people who can help identify\nproblems early through ongoing review.\n\n\nAnd most of these problems, when identified, can be readily\naddressed.\n\n\nIt is rare for IT consultants to know your business and " business\nexperience", Furthermore, IT consultants and business people conceptualise\nthe world in different ways.\n\n\nA good working relationship between the consultant and the end-user\nshould be established.\n\n\nTherefore, ensure that at least one end-user is involved in the\nmeetings with the consultant.\n\n\n Who Should Take Charge? \n\n\nWhether you decide on using in-house expertise or an external IT\nconsultant, someone or some committee has to be set up to oversee the\ncomputerisation project.\n\n\nComputerisation is a cooperative effort between the users and the\nconsultant, and this effort needs to be guided to ensure a smooth\nimplementation.\n\n\nTo emphasise the importance of the effort being made by the company\nto computerise, active involvement and commitment of top management is often\nnecessary.\n\n\nIt is usually recommended that the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO) of\nthe company chairs a committee comprising the heads of departments affected\nby computerisation.\n\n\nThe committee should meet regularly to keep track of the progress of\nthe project, make the necessary important decisions along the way, and review\nthe post-implementation process.\n\n\nHaving said all these, we can now get down to the details of\nspecifying your requirements.\n\n\n What Are Your Computerisation Needs? \n\n\nThis is the first step of the feasibility study.\n\n\nIt aims to determine the computerisation needs of your company by\nidentifying and documenting the areas to computerise and to prioritise them\nbased on your business strategies.\n\n\n Things to do \n\n\nWhat you need to do during this first step is to: Review your\norganisation\'s goals and priorities.\n\n\nBy refreshing yourself on this, you will be better able to focus on\nhow computerisation can help you attain these goals.\n\n\nDetermine how computerisation can benefit your company strategically.\n\n\nHere, you may be able to work on getting strategic advantage out of\ncomputerisation rather than just looking at how to get a job done faster.\n\n\nDetermine which application systems offer the greatest potential\nbenefits to the company.\n\n\nThis will help you to prioritise the areas you want to computerise,\ntaking into consideration your strategic plans and costs.\n\n\nAssess your company\'s existing environment and structure.\n\n\nAre you ready to computerise?\n\n\nHave you establish your fundamentals?\n\n\nIf not, get everything in order.\n\n\n What is achieved \n\n\nBy the end of this step, you should be able to draw up a list of\nbusiness functions that can be computerised, as well as give some indication\nof the order of priority for computerisation.\n\n\n What Exactly Do You Want The Computer System to do for You? \n\n\nThe next step involves defining the detailed requirements involves\nboth the users and the IT consultants.\n\n\nThis process helps the company and IT consultant analyse existing\nfunctions and procedures in all areas of the company, and facilitates\nbreaking down of these functions and procedures into smaller and more\nmanageable elements.\n\n\nBy doing so, you are able to specify what you want out of\ncomputerisation for the different business functions you have identified.\n\n\n Things to do \n\n\nDuring this step, you need to:\n\n\n1) Review and analyse your current operations.\n\n\nThis examines the detail functioning of the different areas of your\noperations.\n\n\nBy looking at how things are presently done, you may decide to\nmaintain, develop new, enhance or even eliminate the work methods and\nprocedures so that full advantage can be taken of the strengths of computers.\n\n\n2) Gather samples of input documents for the different functions and\nreview the information captured in these documents to determine whether there\nis a need for it or whether any additional information is required.\n\n\nHere you must also determine the frequency of use of each of the\ndocuments.\n\n\n3) Gather samples of all reports ( or output documents) for the\ndifferent functions.\n\n\nAgain, you must take note of the content and frequency of each\nreport.\n\n\n4) Define and document the systems requirements.\n\n\nThis is the point where extra care should be taken to differentiate\nbetween what you must have, what would be useful to have, and what would be\nnice to have in the proposed System.\n\n\nThis will help you to develop a system that is appropriate and\nrelevant to your needs, given the constraints of budget, hardware and\nsoftware.\n\n\nThis is also the time for you to determine how the area under\nanalysis should be integrated to other application areas, how much\ninformation to keep, for how long, and how sensitive it is.\n\n\n What is achieved \n\n\nAt the end of the process, the IT consultant and the company should\nbe able to come up with a document that describes the functions and\nrequirements of the areas under study.\n\n\nExtracts of such a document can be found in Annex\n\n\n11.This document, generally known as a functional specifications\nreport will be submitted to the committee for approval.\n\n\nIt is a very important document which once approved, will be used as\npart of the request-for-Proposal document when shopping for vendors.\n\n\nSuch a report will provide the committee with an idea of the scale of\nthe project and a recommendation on whether customised software or\noff-the-shelf software is required for the project.\n\n\nAnd this in turn will, to a large extent, determine the type of\ncomputers to purchase.\n\n\n Selecting Hardware and software \n\n\nIn defining your requirements, you will already have determined your\napproach to computerisation to a large extent.\n\n\nThe functional specifications document should have given you an idea\nof the scope and magnitude of the project.\n\n\nBased on that, and your analysis of your own resources and direction,\nyou will be able to choose the kind of solution you want.\n\n\nThe main considerations at this stage are the kind of software\nrequired to process your business needs, and the hardware required to drive\nthe software.\n\n\n Software \n\n\nSoftware requirements are determined by the areas of your business\nthat you wish to have computerised.\n\n\nWhat are the applications which are required?\n\n\nIs it in the area of Accounting?\n\n\nProject management?\n\n\nProduction control?\n\n\nOr is it the provision of up-to-date management information?\n\n\nYour requirements would have been specified by now, and you should be\nlooking at whether the software you require can be bought off-the-shelf, or\nif you need to customise such software for your needs, or if you need someone\nto develop the software from scratch.\n\n\n Hardware \n\n\nYou should start looking at hardware requirements only after you have\ndecided on the kind of software required.\n\n\nThere is simply no point in buying the cheapest computer available if\nyour software is going to run like a tortoise on it.\n\n\nThis is the point where you have to identify the kind of computer you\nneed ( mainframe, mini or micro), how many you need, and whether you should\nnetwork them ( ie connect them up in such a way that they can " talk" to each\nother and share peripherals such as inters, modems, etc.) You should also be\nlooking at issues such as electronic storage space ( ie the size of hard\ndisks required), displays required ( large screen or small screen monitors,\ncolour or monochrome, VGA or CGA, etc) and memory etc.\n\n\nSome of the terms used here are further explained in the Annex \nCommon Computer Terms.\n\n\n Approaches to Computerisation \n\n\nSo how are you going to approach this question of selecting your\ncomputers and software?\n\n\nGenerally you have the following alternatives in determining your\napproach to computerisation: Aiming for a turnkey system for the whole\nproject.\n\n\nThis means you appoint a vendor or software house who will work very\nclosely with you in providing a solution for your needs.\n\n\nThis vendor may not be the supplier of all the equipment and\nsoftware that you need, but he will do the running around and put the package\ntogether, and be answerable for the whole solution so that you do not have to\ndeal with countless vendors.\n\n\nThis can be a good solution, except you have to be careful of\ntendency to be overly dependent on the vendor.\n\n\nIt also restricts you somewhat to the kinds of hardware and software\nyou can opt for.\n\n\n2) Developing a solution using pre-packaged applications This\napproach aims at using existing software packages to meet your needs.\n\n\nIt is an economical way to computerise.\n\n\nYou would also have the flexibility of selecting hardware and\nsoftware from a variety of vendors.\n\n\nHowever, it may leave peculiar aspects of your business uncatered\nfor, hence some degree of software customisation is often necessary when\nadopting this approach.\n\n\nIn addition, you must also ensure that all the software modules\nselected are integrated to meet the business needs.\n\n\n3) Opting for in-house development of a solution This option can be\ntaken if you have the resources to employ your own in-house systems people.\n\n\nIt could be the most satisfactory solution if you have highly\nspecialised needs that need constant tuning, customisation and attention.\n\n\nIt is also probably the most expensive.\n\n\n4) Using external systems services.\n\n\nYou may also choose to use what is commonly called a " bureau\nservice" for your business needs.\n\n\nThis means that you use the systems and software set up by an\nexternal company whose business is to cater for the computer needs of\norganisations like yours.\n\n\nFor example, you may be the publisher of a bi-monthly magazine.\n\n\nAll you need is to use the computer to do the layout of your\nmagazine once every two months, and for three to four days only. \n\n\nYou feel that you do not need to use computers in any other way.\n\n\nYou may consider buying time from a bureau service to do this.\n\n\nEach of these approaches has its inherent strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\nBut whatever the case, you will have to make a decision based on\nyour organisation\'s needs and a clear understanding of the strengths and\nweaknesses of the different approaches.\n\n\nOnce you have decided your approach, you can proceed with the\nnitty-gritty on this stage of the computerisation process.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '35236634-3039-4f74-b1ce-ca0e669c06da', 'added':

{'text': "A Guide To The Orchids Of Singapore \n\n\nby Dr Hugh T W Tan & Prof Hew Choy Sin\n\n\nDepartment of Botany\n\n\nNational University of Singapore\n\n\n Starting an orchid collection \n\n\nBefore starting to grow orchids, it would be useful to talk to people\nwho have experience in orchid growing.\n\n\nSome orchids are easier to grow than others and they flower more\nfreely.\n\n\nDendrobiums, for example, are rather robust and less susceptible to\nbacterial attacks than Phalaenopsises.\n\n\nThe Arandas and Ascocendas are free-flowering.\n\n\nCare must be taken to choose plants which fit your home environment.\n\n\nThe conditions in HDB flats or condominiums will be drier and shadier\nthan those in gardens or nurseries.\n\n\nThe duration and direction of sunshine are important considerations\nfor home orchid growing.\n\n\nAccording to many orchid growers, there are four basic rules to\nobserve for growing orchids well:\n\n\n1) Purchase only good healthy plants.\n\n\n2) House them adequately.\n\n\n3) Water and feed them correctly.\n\n\n4) Protect them from pests and diseases.\n\n\n Growing orchids in pots \n\n\nOrchids can be grown in orchid pots and wooden baskets.\n\n\nOrchid pots have holes in the bottom as well as at the sides.\n\n\nWooden baskets are commonly used for growing strap-leaved Vandas and\nAscocendas.\n\n\nSpecial pots are used for the cultivation of Phalaenopsises .\n\n\nWell-built, hard and symmetrical charcoal and/ or red brick are the\nmain potting media for epi phytic orchids.\n\n\nThese are broken up with a hammer into chips.\n\n\nThe size of the charcoal or brick chip depends on the size of the\nplant and pot.\n\n\nPlants with finer roots ( Oncidiums and Dendrobiums) grow better in\npieces of charcoal or brick ( 1-2 cm across) which provide better retention\nof water and nutrients.\n\n\nHowever with time, this may result in poorer aeration.\n\n\nTo ensure better aeration, place larger pieces of bricks or charcoal\nat the bottom of the pot.\n\n\nWhen charcoal is used, it is useful to place a few pieces of red\nbrick on top of the charcoal when plants are grown under full sunlight.\n\n\nCharcoal absorbs light readily and the surface temperature of\ncharcoal may rise above 40C by noon.\n\n\nThe red colour of the brick chips tends to reflect away the infrared\nrays, the source of the heat.\n\n\n( This is why traditionally, roofing tiles are reddish).\n\n\nAll potted orchids require a dry environment around the roots between\nwatering so the medium must be well-drained.\n\n\nFor potting monopodial orchids ( Arandas, Arachnises, Arantheras,\nHolttumaras, Mokaras and Vandas), the cutting is first placed at the centre\nof the pot.\n\n\nPlants with at least two aerial roots are used for planting.\n\n\nThe bricks and/ or charcoal chips are then filled in around the\ncutting, the larger chips at the bottom with progressively smaller ones at\nthe top of the pot.\n\n\nIf the cutting is heavy, then use more bricks which can anchor it\nbetter.\n\n\nCharcoal is less dense.\n\n\nSympodial orchids such as Dendrobiums and Oncidiums are planted with\nthe oldest pseudo bulb close to the side of the pot and the newest pseudobulb\nfacing the centre of the pot.\n\n\nThis will provide ample space for the new pseudobulb to grow.\n\n\nWhen planting sympodial orchids, use plants with at least two\nbackbulbs.\n\n\nThe more psuedobulbs, the more food reserves available to the clump\nfor new growth and recovery is faster.\n\n\nGenerally, orchids are repotted every three years or when the roots\nhave overgrown their pots.\n\n\nFreshly repotted plants are kept away from rain and strong sunlight.\n\n\nOrchids, like other plants, require sunlight to manufacture their own\nfood.\n\n\nGenerally, orchids can be divided into three major groups according\nto their light requirements - shade, ( 50% full sunlight),partial shade (\n70-80% full sunglight) and full sunlight ( 100%) Arachnises Arandas,\nArantheras Holttumaras, Mokaras and terete and semi-terete Vandas grow well\nunder full sunlight; strapped leaved Vandas and Phalawnopsises are more\nshade-loving; endrobriums and Oncidiums grow well under partial shade.\n\n\n Watering \n\n\nWatering can be too little, too much or the right amount.\n\n\nOrchids are often killed by excessive watering rather than by too\nlittle watering.\n\n\nIf the leaves are dull looking and the bottom leaves drying and\ndropping off, these are signs that the plants have been receiving too little\nwater.\n\n\nExcessive watering encourages fungal and bacterial infection.\n\n\nAlso, leaves become yellowish and weak, showing signs of starvation\nbecause the roots are not growing well.\n\n\nNew growth of roots is a good sign to note whether your orchids are\ngrowing well.\n\n\nIn Singapore, water the plant at least once a day.\n\n\n Fertilizers \n\n\nOrchids, like all other green plants, require both the trace and\nmajor elements.\n\n\nAn adequate supply of these elements in the form of fertilizers is\nessential for the healthy growth of orchid plants.\n\n\nFertilizers such as Gaviota 63 or 67, Welgrow, Hyponex and\nNitrophoska are commonly used.\n\n\nMost of these fertilizers contain the three major elements nitrogen (\nN), phosphorus ( P) and potassium ( K) in different proportions and some\ntrace elements.\n\n\nGaviota 63 has an NPK ratio of 21: 21: 21 whereas Gaviota 67 has a\nratio of 14: 27: 27.\n\n\nIn general, a high nitrogen content favours vegetative growth and\nlarge quantities of potassium and phosphorous encourage flowering.\n\n\nIt is a good practice to supply the orchids with lower dosage of\nfertilizers at more frequent intervals.\n\n\nThis will avoid excessive accumulation of nutrients in the potting\nmedia and wastage of fertilizer.\n\n\nOne should never exceed the recommended dosage.\n\n\nExtra fertilizers will not make plants grow faster but may kill them\nInstead!\n\n\nWhen using chemical fertilizers, it is important to dissolve the\nfertilizer completely before use.\n\n\nIf not, the crystals may be deposited on the leaves or roots and\ncause burn and injury to the plant.\n\n\nThe solution can then be sprayed on the leaves and roots.\n\n\nIt is a common practice to apply fertilizers in the late afternoon\nwhen the sun has gone down.\n\n\nThe droplets of fertilizers on the leaves can act as small lenses to\nconcentrate the light and the heat of the sun's rays and cause burn if one\nsprays during the late morning or noon.\n\n\nOrganic fertilizers may also be applied to a plant.\n\n\nThese are usually derived from chicken dung or bat and bird guano (\ndroppings) and applied at the rate of a teaspoonful per pot every few months.\n\n\nNeedless to say, follow the recommendations given in the\ninstructions.\n\n\nThis has the advantage of breaking down slowly and providing a\nsustained supply of nutrients over a period of time.\n\n\nInitially growth is vigorous after application.\n\n\nHowever, organic fertilizers tend to have an odour and ultimately\nbreak down to close up the potting medium leading to poor drainage and root\nrot.\n\n\n Pests and diseases \n\n\nIn this section, we have only provided brief descriptions.\n\n\nFor more details, we refer readers to the following books published\nby the Primary Production Department, Ministry of National Development,\nNational Development Building, 5 Maxwell Road, Singapore 0106, Republic of\nSingapore:\n\n\n1) Chuo, S.K.\n\n\n1979.\n\n\nAgriculture Handbook No 4.\n\n\nCommon pests of orchids in Singapore.\n\n\n2) Sanderson, F R and T A Yong.\n\n\n1972.\n\n\nAgriculture Bulletin\n\n\nNo 1.  Diseases of orchids in Singapore \n\n\nOrchids like other plants are attacked by various kinds of pests and\ndiseases.\n\n\nThe attacks occur when plants are grown under the best cultural\nconditions.\n\n\nCommon pests in orchid cultivation include the insects ( scale,\nmealy-bugs, yellow beetle, caterpillars, thrips) and the non-insects ( red\nspider mite, snails and slugs).\n\n\nOrchids can be infected by bacteria, fungi and viruses.\n\n\nThe most common orchid fungal disease anthracnose ( caused by\nColletotrichum species or Cloeosporium species) and flower blight ( Fusarium\nmoniliforme), crown rot ( Phytophthora palmivora) and basal rot ( Sclerotium\nrolfsii).\n\n\nLeaf spot caused by Cercospora species appears to be confined to\nDendrobiums.\n\n\nThe first symptom of an anthracnose infection is the presence of one\nor more yellowish brown lesions ( well-defined or circumscribed abnormal\nregion) in the leaf.\n\n\nThe lesions enlarge with time and turn dark brown.\n\n\nCrown rot ( black rot) first appears as a small watery brown spot on\nthe lower leaf surface.\n\n\nIt spreads and attacks the growing tip, causing a tip die back.\n\n\nRoot rot ( basal rot) follows after infection of the roots or basal\npart of the stem.\n\n\nOncidiums are highly susceptible to basal rot.\n\n\nBacterial rot is common in Phalaenopsises, particularly during the\nrainy season.\n\n\nA high percentage of orchids are infected with diseases such as\nCymbidium mosaic virus and Odontoglossom ringspot virus disease.\n\n\nVirus diseases are incurable at this time.\n\n\nTo destroy the virus one has to destroy the plant by burning or auto\nclaving ( pressure cook at a pressure of I kg cm2 for 15 minutes).\n\n\nEven purchasing certified virus-free will not ensure that they stay\nvirus-free forever.\n\n\nThe only hope is in the long term when plant breeders and\npathologists develop virus-resistant plants.\n\n\nIf the virus-infected plants do not show adverse symptoms or\nweakening, then one can still cultivate the plant, especially if the flowers\nare not affected.\n\n\nPests and diseases in orchids except virus disease, can be\ncontrolled by the use of appropriate insecticides, bactericides or\nfungicides.\n\n\nIt is beyond the scope of this book to describe in detail the\nvarious pests and diseases that attack the orchids and the control measures.\n\n\nIn management of pests and diseases, prevention is always better\nthan cure.\n\n\nIt is a good practice to keep the place well ventilated and clean.\n\n\nRemove all dead leaves or infected plant parts.\n\n\nKeep a constant watch for pests and diseases and speedy eradication\ncertainly helps.\n\n\nWhen spraying with pesticides ( acaricides, insecticides,\nbactericides or fungicides), take care not to get any spray onto flowers and\nbuds but make sure both sides of leaves are sprayed.\n\n\nIt is unwise to mix the various pesticides unless they are known for\ncertain to be compatible.\n\n\nThey may react to produce compounds that are very poisonous and kill\nor injure the plants.\n\n\nNeedless to say, extreme care should be exercised in using any\npesticide, particularly acaricides or insecticides in flats and homes,\nbecause they are mostly nerve-poisons.\n\n\nNerve-poisons can kill anything with nerves and this includes pet\ndogs, Cats, rabbits, hamsters, birds, fish and ourselves!\n\n\n INCREASING THE VASE-LIFE OF CUT-FLOWERS \n\n\nA flower, be it rose, carnation or orchid will fade faster when it\nis removed from the parent plant.\n\n\nThis is natural because upon excision, the supply of water and food\nto the flower is severed.\n\n\nThe hormonal balance is also affected.\n\n\nAll these will accelerate the processes of senescence ( aging) of\nthe flower leading its death.\n\n\nThe keeping quality of a cut-flower depends on the growth\nconditions of the plant ( preharvest factor) as well as the handling of the\nflower after harvest ( postharvest factor).\n\n\nAs we have no idea of the preharvest condition of the flower when we\nbuy the flowers from the florist, we will only look into some of the\npostharvest handling procedures which will help us to improve the keeping\nquality of the cut-flower.\n\n\nAdequate water uptake through the cut inf]orescence stalk Wilting of\nflowers in an infloresence occurs when the water loss exceeds uptake.\n\n\nUnder normal conditions, water is supplied to the flower\ncontinuously through the xylem.\n\n\nTransport of water through the water-conducting vascular tissues (\nxylem) in the inflorescence stalk is reduced as a result of vascular blockage\n( xylem blockage).\n\n\nVascular blockage can be physical or physiological and or caused by\nbacterial growth.\n\n\nTo prevent vascular blockage by air, it is advisable to recut the\nflorescence stalk under water after the inflorescence is brought back home.\n\n\nIf one cuts the stalk in the air, air bubbles might get into the\ntissues and block further flow of water up the stalk.\n\n\nIncluslon of chemicals or bactericides in the water of the vase will\nprevent microbial growth.\n\n\nAsprin, in small quantities, for example, has been reported to\nextend the vase-life of cut-flowers.\n\n\nAlternatively, one can recut the flower stalk every 2-3 days to\nremove any possible vascular blockage from dying tissue or bacterial growth.\n\n\nTo increase the absorptive surface, cut the stem at a slant.\n\n\nDo not immerse the infloresence stalk fully to ensure an adequate\noxygen supply to the cut stalk as water contains less oxygen than air. \n\n\nIf one does so, the stalk dies and rots quickly.\n\n\n Adequate food supply for the cut-flower \n\n\nSugars serve as a major food and energy source for flowers.\n\n\nTherefore, the supply of sugar in the vase solution is critical for\nthe extension of the vase-life of the flowers.\n\n\nGenerally, sugar is supplied in 1-2 % of the solution ( 1-2 gm in\n100 ml of tap water).\n\n\nHowever, the addition of sugar to the vase solution without\nbactericides may invite bacterial growth, and sometimes ants.\n\n\nFrequent changing of the solution in the vase is thus, desirable.\n\n\nMinimize the exposure of cut-flowers to ethylene.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1d91c073-451b-4fc3-9070-df3fc412d7e6', 'added':

{'text': "Growing Orchids in the Tropics \n\n\n Chapter Five \n\n\n High-Rise Orchid Growing \n\n\nGrowing orchids as balcony plants or as roof plants has always been\nattempted by inveterate enthusiasts lacking a garden.\n\n\nMany an elder pot of Cymbidium or straggly Arachnis can still be\nfound, along with scanty bougainvilleas and leathery Kheng Wah plants, in the\nmost unpropitious city sites.\n\n\nHowever, making orchids flourish under high-rise living conditions\nrequires some care and attention to the pros and cons of the particular site\nand which plants will grow there.\n\n\nThe potential for successful balcony growing is actually quite high,\nespecially given the increasing availability of more or less miniature\nplants.\n\n\nSomebody who rents or buys a flat does not usually do so with orchid\ngrowing in mind.\n\n\nRather, he or she is already living in a flat and wants to know how to\ngrow orchids on the balcony or other available space.\n\n\nSo the emphasis has to be on adapting principles of growing to the\nbalcony you have, rather than giving a prescription for the ideal balcony\nthat you will never have.\n\n\nAll the basic principles of orchid growing apply on balconies, but\ncertain difficulties arise in the application of those principles.\n\n\nThe main difficulties with balconies relate to shortage of space,\ncontrol over sunlight, and drying breezes.\n\n\n SPACE LIMITATIONS \n\n\nAlthough large plants can be grown, they do take up space, and the\nhigh-rise grower is in effect restricted to smaller plants.\n\n\nBut there are other considerations too.\n\n\nPlanning use of space is important.\n\n\nYou will need to consider how your total balcony area is to be\ndivided up between laundry drying and other activities requiring space, or\nfurniture such as a table and chairs.\n\n\nIf you do not have a balcony but just a window ledge, consider\nwhether plants will impede opening and closing windows and so on.\n\n\nHaving settled on where you intend to put the plants, bearing in mind\nsun and wind ( see below), you will then need to build shelving, benches, or\narrangements for hanging pots.\n\n\nIf your balcony is narrow, a single shelf about 15 cm below and\ninside the balcony parapet can be considered.\n\n\nThis is about waist height, which is convenient for watering,\ninspecting the plants and appreciating the blooms.\n\n\nLowering the shelf 15 cm below the parapet for safety ensures some\nextra pot support on the outer side.\n\n\nIf the balcony does not have a solid parapet but only railings, it\nmay be necessary to block the railings so that pots cannot fall through.\n\n\nAt this height the plants will be visible from inside the flat\nthrough the window.\n\n\nBear in mind though that the blooms will tend to grow towards the\nlight, and thus will tend to grow outwards over the balcony, or through the\nrailings, if the sprays are long.\n\n\nOnly turn the plants around to enjoy the sprays once the flowers are\nall opened, otherwise the sprays will bend back to get to the light.\n\n\nThough tempting, do not construct shelving projecting outside the\nbalcony parapet.\n\n\nIts use would be a hazard to those below and is illegal.\n\n\nIf the width of the balcony permits, a second shelf can be built\nbelow and further out, a step down from the top.\n\n\nThis shelf will be more shaded.\n\n\nAlternatively, if suitable, the wall dividing the balcony from the\nflat can be used to as a site for shelving or to hang pots.\n\n\nPots can be hung from hooks directly mounted in the wall, or into\nbattens of hardwood mounted for the purpose, in combination with shelving if\ndesired.\n\n\nAnother decorative alternative is to mount a robust trellis against\nthe wall, with or without training a creeper on it.\n\n\nOrchid pots can then be hooked on to the trellis.\n\n\nEven more ambitious growers may find it possible to construct a\ncomplete miniature orchid frame with provisions to hang pots or grow them on\nbenches as desired.\n\n\nIngenuity and a little thought can lead to very effective use of\nlimited space, limited only by one's creativity and the restrictions of\nrelevant regulations.\n\n\nFor those not fortunate enough to have balconies, windowsills will\ndo, but when the plants are watered provision must be made to catch the\nsurplus, so a suitable trough and a means to drain it are needed.\n\n\nGenerous watering is always needed with orchids potted in the\nnecessary loose potting materials, since 90@c of the water poured on runs\nstraight through.\n\n\nAttempts to grow orchids on windowsills only using spray misting or\nsmall trickles of water are likely to result in plants that are too dry.\n\n\nIf you are tempted to try growing orchids in the office, note that\noffices face the problem that many are air-conditioned during the day but\nnot at night.\n\n\nThis reverses the cycle of cooler nights that most orchids prefer.\n\n\nIt is not known if any orchids like a combination of cooler days,\nwarmer nights and limited illumination.\n\n\n SUNLIGHT CONTROL \n\n\nHow much sunlight a balcony gets depends on which way it faces and\nthe architecture of the building.\n\n\nSome balconies are more or less completely shaded.\n\n\nOn such balconies it is possible to grow a range of shade orchids.\n\n\nOther balconies are exposed to direct sunlight for at least part of\nthe day, getting more or less according to their orientation and the season\nof the year.\n\n\nSunlight shows considerable seasonal variation.\n\n\nNorth- or South-facing balconies will have seasonal differences in\nthe amount of sunlight.\n\n\nThe seasonal shifts in the sun's path may move the shadow on a\nbalcony a surprising amount, and create great variation in the duration of\ndirect sunlight.\n\n\nIt is common to find that a shady spot has become a sunny one through\nthe changes in the sun's path.\n\n\nThis can have disastrous effects on the plants if it is not\nanticipated.\n\n\nIt is necessary to provide extra shade or move the plants, possibly\nby having pots on a trolley rather than a fixed rack or stand.\n\n\nEast- or west-facing balconies are spared this variation, but cannot\nhave more than about six hours sunlight per day.\n\n\nEven on quite sunny balconies, full sun genera will not usually\nflower freely, since the sunlight is almost invariably restricted to some\npart of the day, either morning or afternoon, or is seasonal.\n\n\nBut this means that shading has to be considered anyway.\n\n\nAs was discussed in Chapter Three, it is necessary to provide some\nbreak or shading from direct sun for those plants that cannot take full sun.\n\n\nTo repeat the point, a morning of full sun followed by an afternoon\nof shade is not the same as 50% sunlight.\n\n\nIt is 100% sun followed by 100% shade.\n\n\nSo it is necessary to find some means of dappling or breaking the\nsunlight during those hours when the sun is shining directly on the plants,\nto avoid burning them.\n\n\nShading on balconies can be achieved in various ways.\n\n\nHardy foliage pot plants can be used as shading plants, or a\nframework to support vertical or horizontal shading nets can be used.\n\n\nSuch shade netting when used vertically can also provide a measure of\nwindbreak.\n\n\nCreepers trained on wires can also be used to provide shade screening\nand are attractive in their own right.\n\n\nGrilled balconies provide an easy way of adding netting, but such\nbalconies are likely to be shaded anyway unless facing more or less east.\n\n\nWindbreaks are especially helpful if you are growing shade-loving\norchids, since they are usually not tolerant of drying conditions, and need\ngood sun protection.\n\n\nHowever, in all cases, genera that are tolerant of drying out are\ngenerally better for balconies.\n\n\nIn any of these arrangements the grower will have to observe\nregulations governing the use of the balcony.\n\n\n DRYING BREEZES \n\n\nHigh places tend to be windy, and this dehydrates the plants.\n\n\nIt can also lead to some damage if plants are hanging and can swing,\nor if they have long inflorescences that can sway about when a breeze blows.\n\n\nOn the other hand, fungal problems created by stagnant air and damp\nconditions are not usually a problem in high-rise growing.\n\n\n Coping with Drying Breezes \n\n\nUse a less open potting mixture, with unperforated pots - for better\nmoisture retention.\n\n\nPlastic pots also keep the mixture moist longer.\n\n\nAvoid trying to grow plants on fern root slabs or on logs, or other\nmaterials where the roots are mostly exposed.\n\n\nWater more often than in exposed sites.\n\n\nProvide some form of windbreak as mentioned above.\n\n\nAvoid growing species or hybrids which are especially sensitive to\ndrying out.\n\n\nThis includes Jewel Orchids, Paphiopediums, and many Phalaenopsis.\n\n\nUse stakes or wires to provide more rigid support for flower spikes.\n\n\nTry growing ferns or other foliage plants beneath the orchids.\n\n\nThey thrive on the surplus fertilizer that runs off the orchids on\nthem, and they help provide a moister environment for the orchids.\n\n\nPut down wettable mats.\n\n\n WATERING \n\n\nBalconies are usually dry places, since their floors are designed for\nquick drainage.\n\n\nConcrete, tile or mosaic flooring can get very hot in direct sun, and\ndries very quickly as it does not retain moisture.\n\n\nThe more such a floor can be covered by benching or pots the better.\n\n\nCovering such exposed areas with moisture - retaining materials -\nartificial grass or other kinds of matting for example - should also be\nconsidered.\n\n\nReal enthusiasts will find it very helpful to have a tap installed on\nthe balcony.\n\n\nIf there is no such convenient supply, water will have to be carried\nthrough from elsewhere, which is troublesome.\n\n\nIt is also much better, if possible, to allow water to run through\npots and drain off on to the floor.\n\n\nFew individuals have the time and patience to take the pots to some\nplace else for watering.\n\n\nMoreover, plants on high-rise sites often need more frequent\nwatering because of drying breezes.\n\n\nFor these reasons anything that enhances humidity on the balcony is\nvaluable.\n\n\nOrchid plants do not like to 'have their feet wet.'\n\n\nDrainage is important and the pots should never be grown standing in\nsaucers or pans of water to promote humidity.\n\n\nIt is permissible to stand pots on trays of gravel, so long as the\npots are not actually wet.\n\n\n ADVANTAGES OF HIGH-RISE GROWING \n\n\nThere are a number of advantages in using balconies.\n\n\nPests are less of a problem: a collection of orchids on a balcony is\nmore isolated from other plants, and therefore pests are less likely to visit\nthe collection.\n\n\nAs well as fewer common pests, such as scale insects, this also\nmeans fewer bird dropping or bees pollinating the flowers.\n\n\nAlthough domestic pests like ants and cockroaches may still be\npresent, they are much easier to control.\n\n\nAs well as reduced pests, diseases are also less of a problem for\nbalcony growers.\n\n\nIn particular, the disadvantages of breezes are also their\nadvantages in helping to keep the plants free of disease.\n\n\nRestricted space always makes highrise growers careful about adding\nto their collections, and it pays off handsomely if such growers only choose\nhealthy pest-free plants.\n\n\nSimilarly, weeds are less of a problem, as the seeds do not get to\nthe orchid pots so easily.\n\n\nA word should be put in here to stress the potential of miniature\nplants for the balcony or indoor grower.\n\n\nTechnically a miniature is a plant which is mature at not more than\n15 cm high, but in this book the term is used loosely to refer to any orchid\nwhich is small by the standards normally found among orchids of that general\ntype.\n\n\nGrowers in temperate climates, faced with expensive heating bills,\nhave often specialized in miniature plants to save space, especially plants\nthat will grow under more temperate conditions.\n\n\nAn emphasis on miniatures has not hitherto been a feature of\ntropical growing, but there is no reason why it should not be, as the number\nof would-be growers with restricted space increases.\n\n\nAnyone whose space is limited, even in a garden, can find great\nsatisfaction in miniatures or smaller varieties. \n\n\nThese have a great charm of their own and should not at all be\nthought of as second rate substitutes for larger plants.\n\n\nThey are well worth growing in their own right.\n\n\nIt is to be hoped that more individuals will be tempted to attempt\ngrowing orchids under high-rise conditions, and will inform OSSlA of their\nexperience, so that the benefits of their efforts can be passed on.\n\n\nIt is also our hope that trends to miniaturization, especially in\nDendrobiums, Vandas and Oncidiums, will provide the grower with an increasing\nrange of viable windowsill and balcony plants.", 'subdomain':

{'text': 'Phonecards of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei &\nVietnam\n\n\n Hobby of Collecting Phonecards \n\n\nCARTELEGERY is a term used for telephone-card collecting.\n\n\nIn this age of information technology, more and more countries are\ndeveloping their telecommunication networks and switching from the\ntraditional payphone system to a cashless system.\n\n\nMore and more varieties of designs in phonecards will emerge, thus\nproviding phonecard collectors with a wealth of new materials to choose from.\n\n\nIn Singapore, the Singapore Telecom has so far issued many interesting\nand attractive phonecards which have caused strong enthusiasm in the\ncollecting of Singapore phonecards.\n\n\nAlthough it is a relatively new hobby in comparison with coin\ncollecting and stamp collecting, it is a very popular hobby amongst people of\nall walks of life.\n\n\nPhonecards can be collected in used or mint conditions.\n\n\nIn the case of used Singapore phonecards, a collector may, for\nexample, collects those with one punch-mark ( local term used is " FINE\nUSED").\n\n\nWith the increasing number of phonecards having an array of\nattractive designs, and the problem of certain phonecards having limited\nissue, a collector may turn to thematic collecting.\n\n\nAlthough a collector can collect Singapore or Malaysia phonecards by\ntype having a single design or pictorial view, there is an area of collection\nthat he can advance to and that is, collecting phonecards with various series\nnumbers ( eg 5SIGA) in the control numbers on the reverse side of the\nphonecards having a single design or view.\n\n\nUnless one has followed the issue from the start, he may not be able\nto obtain the early issue in mint condition unless he is willing to pay a\nhigh price for it.\n\n\nWe may then go for the used one which will be cheaper and easier to\nfind.\n\n\nA serious collector may go further and collect phonecards of various\nvarieties and errors which the manufacturer is unconscious of.\n\n\nThe collecting of peripherals in Singapore has gained interest\namongst many local collectors.\n\n\nSome examples of the peripherals are\n\n\n( a) the plastic and paper wallets in which the Anritsu phonecards\nand the complimentary\n&dollar;1 student phonecards are supplied in respectively.\n\n\nThere are 2 varieties of the Anritsu plastic wallets, one having the\nprinted telephone facing left and the other facing right.\n\n\n( b) the Anritsu instruction sheets which when folded up, are of\nphonecard size.\n\n\nThere are four different types to collect.\n\n\nWhatever the reason may be, one can tailor his collection to suit his\nbudget, interest and the availability of the phonecards.\n\n\nLIM KHENG CHYE\n\n\nAUGUST 1992 \n\n\n\n\n Attractively Designed \n\n\nPhonecards come in many attractive designs and can be bought from\nneighbourhood sundry shops as well as large, retail chains.\n\n\nA few companies have also used phonecards as promotional giveaways.\n\n\nYou can get a\n&dollar;2 phonecard free if you buy one of Mobil\'s car servicing packages.\n\n\nNEC gave away phonecards to its special visitors at the recent\nSingapore 2000 exhibition.\n\n\nNTUC Income, Sharp and Paris Miki are some of the other companies who\nuse phonecards as promotional giveaways.\n\n\nAs the popularity and demand for low denomination cards increases,\ncompanies have used these cards to place advertisements.\n\n\nOf the 29 designs available, 20 of these carry advertisements and\nmessages from various companies.\n\n\n A Collector\'s Item \n\n\nThe attractiveness and unique designs on phonecards have made them\ncollector\'s items.\n\n\nMr Dennis Lim, a lecturer from a local polytechnic, is one such\nenthusiast.\n\n\nHe started collecting phonecards in 1985 when he was a student in the\nUnited Kingdom.\n\n\nWhen he had to make long-distance calls home, Mr Lim found that it\nwas so much easier to use a phonecard than to grapple with coins.\n\n\nThe used phonecards became the start of his collection and today, he\nhas hundreds of phonecards from Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United\nKingdom.\n\n\nTo widen his collection, Mr Lim buys the lowest denomination cards\nfrom Singapore and exchanges them with collectors.\n\n\nNew additions to his collection are also acquired from overseas.\n\n\nMr Lim, who also collects coin, said that there are not many\nphonecard collectors in Singapore.\n\n\nHowever, this hobby will pick up and in a few years, collecting\nphonecards may be a favourite pastime with many, like stamp or coin\ncollecting.\n\n\nThis is already happening in countries such as Japan where there are\nthousands of designs of phonecards and a tereka ( telephone card) collecting\nmania has sprung up, mostly among high-school students.\n\n\nA highly-prized phonecard can sometimes be traded between collectors\nfor nearly 60 times its face value.\n\n\n Phonecard Exhibition  In Paris this year, an exhibition was\nheld for the first time for phonecard enthusiasts to display their\ncollection.\n\n\nA phonecard issued by French Telecom with a face value of only a few\ndollars was auctioned for\n&dollar;6,000 during this exhibition.\n\n\nAnother card signed by the former French Minister of Post and Telecom\nfetched S&dollar;4,300.\n\n\nThis could spur many to take up this hobby as phonecards, like coins,\nstamps and other collectibles, can appreciate in value with time.\n\n\nHowever, for now, most of us are contented with the practical uses of\nthe phonecard.\n\n\nLike the many cards that we carry in our wallet these days, the\nphonecard will probably be one which we will not want to leave home without.\n\n\nKEYLINES ( a publication of Singapore Telecom) ( August, 1990) \n\n\n\n\n First Phonecard Display \n\n\nCardphones were first introduced in Singapore in 1985.\n\n\nWith the issue of new and attrac1ive phonecards over the years,\nphonecard collecting has become a remarkably popular hobby in Singapore.\n\n\nLast month, the 185 designs of phonecards produced by Singapore\nTelecom since 1985 were exhibited for the first time.\n\n\nThe exhibition, organised by Singapore Telecom and held at its\nheadquarters in Comcentre, attracted collectors of all ages.\n\n\nIn opening the exhibition, Mr Wong Hung Khim, President and CEO of\nSingapore Telecom said th\'at there are more than 1,000 serious phonecard\ncollectors in Singapore.\n\n\nThis number is growing steadily, as can be seen in the queues,\nparticularly when phonecards with new designs go on sale.\n\n\nLast December, Singapore Telecom set up a Phonecard Collectors\' Club\nto cater to the special needs of collectors and to make it more convenient\nfor them to obtain new issues.\n\n\nThe club today has more than 300 members.\n\n\nThey automatically receive all new issues, without having to queue\nfor them.\n\n\nEach club member is also assigned a special serial number which will\nappear on all phonecards issued to the member.\n\n\nToday, phonecards produced by Singapore Telecom fall into several\ncategories.\n\n\nStandard cards issued by Singapore Telecom are known as \'definitives\'.\n\n\nThese are used for a period of time and reprinted when required.\n\n\nSingapore Telecom also issues \'commemorative cards\' for special\noccasions.\n\n\nThese are available in limited quantities.\n\n\nOf the 185 designs that were exhibited last month, 148 of these were \'advertiser\ncards\', produced by companies as an advertising and promotional medium.\n\n\nKEYLINES ( a publication of Singapore Telecom) ( March, 1992) \n\n\n\n\n Phonecard Collectors\' Club \n\n\nTo keep track of new releases of phonecards be assured of getting\nthem, collectors can join the Singapore Telecom Phonecard Collectors\' Club.\n\n\nTo become a member of the Phonecard Collector you hove to open a\nStanding Order Deposit Account for Phonecards with an initial deposit of\n&dollar;200. \n\n\nThis will guarantee you a set of phonecards with matching\nnumbers each time there are new releases.\n\n\nFor additional sets, you need to remit deposits in multiples of\n&dollar;200. \n\n\nThe deposit will be used to offset the cost of the phonecards\nallocated to you.\n\n\nYou need only top-up deposit account when you receive a statement\nfrom Singapore Telecom.\n\n\nFor more information, please call 284 2469 or write to the Phonecord\nCollectors\' Unit, Singapore Telecom, PO Box 38, Singapore 9123.\n\n\nKEYLINES ( a publication of Singapore Telecom) ( December, 1991) \n\n\n\n\n New Favourable Collection Item \n\n\n More And More People Collect Phonecards \n\n\nThe attractiveness and unique designs on phonecards have not only had\ntheir practical value, but also their collection value.\n\n\nMore and more people collect phonecards nowadays and some have even\nsuggested to form a phonecard club.\n\n\nPhonecard is a product of the age of informotion technology of the\ntwentieth century.\n\n\nPhonecards have gradually become a new favourable collection item\nbesides numismatic and philatelic items.\n\n\nSingapore Telecoms launched its experimental phonecard service in\n1985.\n\n\nSome collectors had since then started collecting phonecards.\n\n\nThe first generation phonecards ( Anritsu phonecards) which have the\nsame thickness as the present MRT stored value cards are of simple and plain\ndesign in red and white colours.\n\n\nA full-scale launching of the phonecard service was made in January\n1989.\n\n\nNew generation of phonecards ( manufactured by GEC-Plessey\nTelecommunicatons Ltd) are not only thicker but also with a characteristic of\ncolourful design.\n\n\nThere are to-date 33 different designs issued by the Singapore\nTelecom, of which 22 designs are advertisement type and the remaining 11\ndesigns are definitive issues by Singapore Telecom.\n\n\nMr Wong Hon Sum, 51 year old businessman with more than 40 years af\ncollecting experience said that he realized 5 years ago that phonecard has\nits collection potential.\n\n\nHe had seen the craziness in collecting phonecards when he was in\nJapan in 1985.\n\n\nSince then he has started his collection.\n\n\nHowever, the unattractiveness design of the Anritsu phonecards had\nbeen discarded after use in the early days.\n\n\nWith his abundant experience, Mr Wong also said that he knew that\nTelephone cards would be one of the collectors item, as experience tells him\nthat where something is being thrown away, the quantity of the item would be\ngetting lesser and lesser and eventually, it would become a valuable\ncollection item.\n\n\nTime has proven his soothsay.\n\n\nThe experimental Anritsu phonecards are now difficult to acquire.\n\n\nWith the rapid technological advancement nowadays, there are\ndifferent systems developed in the phonecards technology.\n\n\nFor example, France uses RAA chip in the phonecords which is very\ndifferent from Singapore phonecards.\n\n\nMr Lim Chor Pee said that phonecard symbolizes the prosperity of the\nsociety, and the pace in the advancement of information technology.\n\n\nYou will not only see the change in design philosophy but also the\nadvancement of technology.\n\n\nHe is a 39 year old professional who commented that collecting\nphonecards is o new hobby for the nineteen eighties and nineties.\n\n\nHe started his collection five years ago when he was a student in\nEngland and he has hundreds of them now.\n\n\nNr Ng Ko; Chin, 55 years old, who has 12 years experience in\ncollecting philatelic items also started his collection 5 years old.\n\n\nHe said that it is human nature to collect something.\n\n\nWith no exception, he started his collection when phonecards were\njust introduced by Singapore Telecom.\n\n\nMr.Lim also said that when you collect phonecards you will enjoy the\nhobby and that you will get to know more friends.\n\n\nThis will help you to widen your social circle.\n\n\nIt is just like playing a game.\n\n\nIt is a meaningful hobby and a healthy social activity.\n\n\nAn English translation from an article in Chinese in Sin Ming Daily\n( Chinese newspaper) ( September 28, l990) \n\n\n\n\n Mistake In Phone Card \n\n\nOne of the four phone cards issued recently by Singapore Telecom to\ncelebrate the Lunar New Year has been printed with a wrong Chinese character.\n\n\nThis is believed to be the first incident of its kind, the Chinese\nnewspaper Lianhe Zaobao reported today.\n\n\nThe four cards link up to form one single motif with a dancing lion\nand dragon.\n\n\nOn one of them, a\n&dollar;20-card, is the word " Spring".\n\n\nThe lower half of the Chinese word " spring" ( " chun") is a " re" (\nmeaning" sun").\n\n\nBut it has been written with an extra stroke changing it into " mu"\n( which means " eye").\n\n\nA calligrapher, Mr Chen Hang, told the newspaper it was " a definite\nmistake".\n\n\n" Even if it was to be accepted as a form of ancient writing, the "\nre" cannot be written as " mu", Mr Chen said.\n\n\nA Telecom spokesman said it has not received any complaints so far,\nbut investigations are underway.\n\n\nHe said it is quite impossible to recall the cards now.\n\n\nTelecom is not sure how many have been sold.\n\n\nThe New Paper ( February 5, 1991) \n\n\n\n\n\n Now, A-Lat-Card For Phone Users \n\n\n\nLAT, Malaysia\'s premier cartoonist, is one up on Superman. \n\n\n\nHe has been slipping in and out of telephones lately.\n\n\n\nNot phone booths like the cape crusader but the very instruments\nthemselves.\n\n\n\nActually, it is his alter ego, the tousled hair kampung boy who is\na central character in his immensely popular cartoons depicting life in\nMalaysia, that has been doing all the work.\n\n\n\nThat character and others have been roped in to help sell\nUniphoneKads, the phone card for Malaysian telephones.\n\n\n\nFour different illustrations from the 40-year old cartoonist\'s\nScenes of Malaysian Life series were selected for printing on the M&dollar;10 (\nS&dollar;6.50) phone cards.\n\n\n\nThey were advertised this week.\n\n\n\nThe new vehicle for the former journalist\'s cartoons highlight the\nappeal of his creations.\n\n\n\nThe Straits Times ( April 12, 1991)', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source':

{'text': "The Collector's Guide To Singapore Postage Stamps & Postal\nStationery ( First Edition 1992) \n\n\n Starting and Caring for your Stamp Collection \n\n\nStarting a stamp collection is like building up your own miniature art\ngallery and encyclopedia.\n\n\nBecause that's what stamps are - little pieces of art, each with a\nstory.\n\n\nThrough stamps you can find out the history and geography of a\ncountry, understand its culture and ideals, marvel at its achievements,\nadmire its scenery, architecture or handicraft, appreciate its flora and\nfauna.\n\n\nYou can also enjoy a stamp for its own sake, studying its beautiful\ndesign details, printing intricacies and colours.\n\n\nStamps are so fascinating it is little wonder that even after so many\nyears, stamp collecting remains the most popular hobby in the world today.\n\n\n STARTING \n\n\nStamp collecting need not be an expensive hobby.\n\n\nThere are a few ways to get you started.\n\n\na) Save whatever stamps come on mail you, your family or friends\nreceive.\n\n\nCut the stamps off the envelopes making sure not to cut too closely\nas otherwise the stamp may be damaged.\n\n\nThen place them face up in warm water till they are well soaked and\ncan come off the backing paper easily.\n\n\nNext wash off any residue traces of gum from the back and put the\nstamps between the pages of a thick book such as a telephone directory till\nthey are dry and nicely pressed and you have just started your own\ncollection!\n\n\nb) Buy a pack of used stamps from a stamp dealer or bookshop.\n\n\nThe pack may contain stamps from all over the world or from just one\ncountry.\n\n\nThe stamps in the pack may also be on a specific theme eg ships and\nboats, aircraft, birds, etc.\n\n\nc) Buy stamps currently available from the post office.\n\n\nFor a wider selection of stamps, you can go to any of the 6\nphilatelic outlets.\n\n\nOr you can start a Standing Order Deposit Account ( SODA) and be\nassured of receiving your stamps for every new issue.\n\n\nMore details of the services available for collectors are given on\npage 28.\n\n\nd) Exchange stamps with fellow collectors.\n\n\nJoining stamp clubs is a good way to help you meet up with other\ncollectors and learn more about the hobby.\n\n\nIf you know about a stamp exhibition, you should visit it to see how\nothers write up their collections.\n\n\n COLLECTING AND COLLATING \n\n\nAs you progress in your understanding of stamp collecting, you may\nwant to organise or specialise according to subject or theme.\n\n\nYou can choose themes which interest you such as transportation,\nbirds, flowers, sport, architecture.\n\n\nYou can also collect according to country, e.g. all the stamps of\nSingapore, or according to a period of time in the postal or political\nhistory of a country.\n\n\nWhatever your interest, your stamps will give you hours of pleasure\nas you spend time studying them.\n\n\n The COLLECTOR'S KIT \n\n\nStamps are like antiques-their value will diminish if not properly\ncared for.\n\n\nTo preserve the value of your stamps, you will need to keep them in\ngood condition.\n\n\nThere is a wide range of accessories in the market to help protect\nyour stamps from damage or deterioration.\n\n\nSome basic accessories are listed here.\n\n\nStamp albums can help you to organise your collection.\n\n\nThe album pages may be printed with illustrations of the stamps of a\nparticular country or may be plain with only the country name or the name of\na theme ( such as birds, transportation, etc.) printed on them.\n\n\nThe use of gummed paper hinges to mount stamps to album pages-are\nless popular these days as hinges disturb the gum of unused stamps.\n\n\nInstead, the use of transparent strips ( commonly called Hawid\nstrips) for mounting stamps to album pages have gained popularity.\n\n\nFor collectors of first day covers, first day cover albums with\ntransparent polythene pockets are useful.\n\n\nThey help keep the covers from soiling through frequent handling.\n\n\nTweezers allow you to handle stamps without dirtying or damaging\nthem.\n\n\nChoose those made of good quality stainless steel with flat rounded\nends as those with sharp ends may damage the stamps.\n\n\nThe tweezers you should buy are stamp tweezers which have flat ends\nand not cosmetic tweezers which have ridges for better grip.\n\n\nStock books with transparent strips for holding stamps are useful for\nbeginners.\n\n\nThey keep your stamps in one place.\n\n\nWhen you decide later on organising your collection, you can transfer\nthe stamps from the stock book to your stamp album.\n\n\nGlassine envelopes are made of special thin paper to keep grease and\ndampness from damaging stamps.\n\n\nYou can store your stamps in these envelopes until you put them into\nyour stamp albums.\n\n\nThese envelopes are available in packs.\n\n\nWhether you collect stamps for fun or for financial returns, you will\nfind a stamp catalogue an important reference book.\n\n\nStamp catalogues give complete listings of all the stamps issued by\ncountry.\n\n\nGenerally, catalogue listings provide details on the types of stamps\nissued, from the earliest to current, the dates of issue, face values and\nmarket values ( both mint and fine used), colours and descriptions of\ndesigns, perforation details, printing processes and varieties, names of\ndesigners and printers.\n\n\nThe information in such catalogues can help you estimate the value of\nyour collection, alert you to the printing varieties that exist so that you\ncan look out for them, let you know the number of stamps to make up a\ncomplete set and educate you on the various details to look for in a stamp.\n\n\nTo help you identify your stamps, some basic accessories are required\nand these are as follows:\n\n\nA Colour Guide will help both beginners and specialists in\nidentifying the colours of early issues which tend to be printed in single\ncolour or at most two colours.\n\n\nModern stamps are printed in four or more colours making colour\nidentification difficult.\n\n\nA magnifying glass is another important tool.\n\n\nAvailable in the form of table top, hand held or pocketsize, a\nmagnifying glass enables you to study details of the design and printing in\nthe stamp.\n\n\nThose interested in ascertaining the size of perforations of their\nstamps will find a perforation gauge indispensable.\n\n\nWith the gauge, you can measure the number of complete perforations\nwithin the length of 20mm of a stamp easily.\n\n\n PHILATELIC SERVICES \n\n\nSingapore postage stamps and postal stationery are designed by local\nartists and graphic designers.\n\n\nEach is a work of art which gives an insight into the country's\nunique history and heritage.\n\n\nCollecting Singapore postage and postal stationery is one way to\nlearn about Singapore in a colourful, fun and fascinating way. \n\n\nPhilatelic Counters

{'text': "Bodies and Non Bodies: Narrativity in Lin Hsin Hsin's Recent Works\n\n\n\nIn my introductory remarks to Lin Hsin Hsin's works of time ( 1991)\nwhich constituted the principal theme of her last exhibition, I made passing\nmention of Lessing, implying that discussion of time in art have to square up\nto him.\n\n\nOn reviewing those remarks I regret that I not provide sufficient\nairing of Lessing's notions on that subject, and remained content with a\ncryptic reference.\n\n\nLin's present works and the focus of my interpretation of them permit\nme to redress that neglect; in dealing with Lessing's thesis Lin's\nproductions can be seen in a wide historical field.\n\n\nMy concern here is with narrativity, it is an interest that has\nhovered at the edges of Lin's painting practice, occasionally streaming\ntowards and occupying the central arena of her pictures.\n\n\nI believe there has now emerged a sustained and serious attempt by Lin\nto explore the realm of pictorial narrative; her pre-occupation can\nespecially be discerned in small pictures executed in oil on paper.\n\n\nIn entering into this genre, she has moved into a context which has\nbeen dominant in art history until the advent of modernism; narrativity,\nhowever, has re-emerged with particular force in contemporary practices, and\nwith it has also surfaced interest in representation.\n\n\nNarrativity and representation have given rise to complex practices\nand works involving space, time and bodies.\n\n\nSpace, time and bodies are the constituent components of Lessing's\nthesis and it will be useful to briefly review his position and then proceed\ntowards a discussion of Lin's present productions.\n\n\nLessing distinguished the arts of space from those of time; he was\nprompted to do so as he probed into the deep structures of the Laoc group; in\ndoing so he proposed a thesis concerning narrative in visual arts, and\nparticularly in painting.\n\n\nRecently the implication of Lessing's advances have been viewed\ndubiously and in some quarters met with incredulity; nevertheless, his\nnotions have settled to form part of the grounds for art historical and\ncritical practices.\n\n\nPainting and poetry, according to Lessing, employ wholly different\nsigns; whereas the former utilises forms and colours in space, the latter is\nmade up of sounds in time.\n\n\nSpace and time are the distinguishing, defining dimensions in which\nthese arts assume their distinctive identities and characteristics.\n\n\nEven as they are distinctive, Lessing takes care to resist attempts\nto make then exclusive to one another; he is equally sensitive to the\nlimitations of both the arts of space and of time.\n\n\nIt is in these contexts that he offers his most compelling\nobservations.\n\n\nForms and colours in space area, in Lessing's eyes, analogous to\nbodies.\n\n\nObjects which exist side by side, or whose parts so exist, are called\nbodies.\n\n\nConsequently bodies with visible properties are the peculiar subjects\nof painting.\n\n\nA little further on in his diagnosis he adds: All bodies, however,\nexist not only in space, but also in time; painting can intimate, even\nexemplify time but only as it is suggested through forms.\n\n\nHow is this manifested?\n\n\nThe apprehension of time is possible through varying appearances of\nbodies; each single appearance is the outcome of a preceding one and is the\ncause of a following one; each appearance also projects a single moment of an\naction and embodies the centre of a present action.\n\n\nHaving advanced his thesis to this position Lessing proclaims the\nformative criteria of painting: as the painter can use but one moment at any\ngiven occasion, ie a single body cast in one appearance, it is vital that the\nmost important one be selected; this is the most pregnant one - one most\nsuggestive of what has gone before and what is to follow.' These conclusions\nentail a number of assumptions; I will highlight three of them.\n\n\nFirstly, the bodies referred to by Lessing are incarnated as human\nforms or figures; they are inflamed with purpose, identity, consciousness and\nare highly articulated.\n\n\nAction is equated with the human figure in motion; indeed, the figure\nin its entirety is a repertoire of gestures.\n\n\nSecondly, the arrangement and action of these bodies require space\nwhich is ample and correspondingly articulated; the spatialization envisaged\nby Lessing is akin to that of a theatrical stage.\n\n\nBearing in mind Lessing's twin interests in Homer and the Lacoon,\nthis analogy is not surprising; painting is theatrical action realised in\npictorial terms.\n\n\nThirdly, the content or subject matter of painting is firmly rooted\nin literature; the human figure, acting and moving in space, assumes its\nidentity, purpose and habitat from settled and stable iconographies.\n\n\nAgain recalling Lessing's interests, the shaping, sustaining force of\niconographies is epic literature in which time and space are sequential and\nhomogenous, while bodies and actions are continuous and harmonious.\n\n\nThe dynamics of pictorial narrative and representation have largely\nbeen determined by these conceptions - that is, until the emergence of\nmodernism.\n\n\nRepresentation and especially narrativity have been largely\nmarginalised, even suppressed in the dominant critical accounts of modern\nart; they were believed to be antithetical to such vaunted ideals as flatness\nof the picture surface and purity of the medium which are upheld as intrinsic\nqualities of painting and therefore its true criteria.\n\n\nRecently, critical enterprises have proceeded along radically\ndifferent lines; the situation has shifted away from such reductive, hermetic\npositions and moved towards expansive, multifaceted approaches.\n\n\nIn this respect, some most trenchant discourses have emerged from new\nreadings of productions such as Velazquez's Las Meninas ( 1656) and Manet's\n0lympia ( 1863); these works have proved to be fertile sites for cultivating\nnew, complex ways of constructing the dynamics of pictorial structures, which\ninclude modes of representation and narrativity.2 It is apparent that\nLessing's norms do not prevail.\n\n\nIt is no longer possible to project world views along continuous,\nsmoothly-gliding tracks; neither is it feasible to construct reality by means\nof homogenous entities or with entities which while being contiguous are not\nharmoniously connected.\n\n\nBe that as it may, and more than ever, space, time and bodies are\nstill among the constituting components of artsitic structures.\n\n\nHow are they utilised by Lin Hsin Hsin?\n\n\nHow do they come together in order to suggest narrative conditions?\n\n\nThe word is integral to Lin's cone of vision; however her entry into\nand involvement in the realm of words is appraised, there is little doubt\nwords are formative, shaping mechanism for her.\n\n\nEmotions, perceptions, reflections and sensations are nailed down and\ngiven concrete presences by the word.\n\n\nFor this occasion she has composed Back to Nature and casts it in the\nform of a splintering narrative which also acts as a compendium for her\nvisual creations.\n\n\nThe kernel of many of her pictures is contained in her poem; pictures\nemanate from that poem.\n\n\nBack To Nature satirises the urban dweller; wishing to escape from it\nall, he retreats to the country and having got there is not able to discard\nthe trappings of a city person.\n\n\nStill, there are many wondrous encounters, each tumbling upon the\nother, dispersing in a number of directions; however, these lead to the\nunremitting realisation that after all he's really an intruder/ he's out of\nfocus!\n\n\nBut he is unfazed; being and outsider has the advantage of being\nunfettered and that smells like freedom and success.\n\n\nAnd so, he is ready for takeoff.\n\n\nLet me move on to the pictures.\n\n\nIn discussing them I will focus on those executed in oil on paper for\nit is in these that Lin has moved to fresh grounds.\n\n\nThey are the outcome of her engagement with narrative modes, which\nare distinctive and articulated.\n\n\nThe events and actions embodied in these pictures are invented and\nconstructed by Lin; they arise from her observations of the foibles of her\nfellow human beings; it is important to underline the sense of fellowship.\n\n\nShe is undeniably sympathetic towards the conditions of man; every\nevent, every situation, every encounter wells up from an undiminished spring\nof empathy.\n\n\nLin also cherishes nature.\n\n\nHer approach to her fellow man, while forthright, is also indulgent;\nher belief in nature is unshakable.\n\n\nNot surprisingly her pictures project a consoling, warm aura.\n\n\nThe bodies that articulate her narratives are in part invented and\nspawned by her imagination and in part extracted from the world as it is\nexperienced.\n\n\nThe frog, turtle, bird and fish-like creatures are amongst the\npreferred entities; the human figure appears once in its entirety; also\nfeatured are sea and landscape features which do not merely act as props but\nare vital players in the narrative.\n\n\nIn a few compositions, Lin introduces wiry, figure-like form's, who\nappear to be pirouetting and careening at great speeds; these figures are\nsheer magic as they are conjured by deftly manipulating linear brushed\nelements which twirl around one another and settle into suggestive,\nanthropomorphic presences.\n\n\nAny discussion of Lin's painting practice and her artistic ideology\nwill have to deal with her utilisation of the medium; she employs oil in a\ndistinct and marked way, almost dissembling its conventional character; the\neffects of her approach determine her construction of pictorial narrative 3.\n\n\nLin radically alters the very nature of oil; she is not concerned\nwith its opulence, density, body or tactile qualities.\n\n\nOn the contrary, she suppresses such ostensive appeals for which oil\nis renown and for which it has been cultivated over the past five centuries.\n\n\nLin brushes oil on to surfaces as washes and as finely modulated\nbrush marks; she renders oil as a translucent membrane, through which light\nand textures percolate and radiate; Whereas artists customarily revel in and\ncultivate the substantial properties of oil, Lin transforms the medium into\ninsubstantial characteristics and conditions.\n\n\nTranslucency and fluidity are the hallmarks of Lin's manipulation of\noil; her pictures project delicacy pushed to the edge of self-effacement, and\nat times lean towards the borders of indeterminacy.\n\n\nThe effects of these on space, time and body are considerable.\n\n\nPictures titled those were the days and great minds think alike serve\nto introduce Lin's narrative world; in them she unveils the ambience of the\nprincipal characters and the nature of events and actions.\n\n\nThe bodies, while legible enough, are modestly formed; their presence\nis not marked by physical gravity and by casting dense shadows but by\nalertness which is elastic and kinetic.\n\n\nNote for instance the althleticism exemplified by the turtles in\nthose were the days and its kinship with the figures in great minds think\nalike.\n\n\nIn these two pictures, clearly marked horizons designate firm\nterrestrial basis; further up the picture surface, stains, dots and dashes of\npigment signify an enlivened firmament, possessing its own vivacity and not\nnecessarily related to the event or action as such.\n\n\nWhile Lin's form language is highly idiosyncratic, she employs it\nconsistently.\n\n\nFitness program and in search of excellence testify to this.\n\n\nThe turtle is familiar enough; the real in the articulated knot of\nlines which simulates a figure.\n\n\nIn fitness program, the figure is borne aloft, taking with it a puff\nof earth, with its legs and hands spread-eagled.\n\n\nIt is an electrifying vision.\n\n\nLin also employs letters adroitly, pressing them to divulge both\nsemantic and pictorial meanings.\n\n\nIn search of excellence marks a dramatic departure from established\ncompositional schemas; by and large Lin favours a horizontal ground which\nappears explicitly and on occasions implicitly congealed in the middle or\nlower middle sector of he picture surface; here the picture plane is tilted\nprecipitously upwards and at an acute gradient.\n\n\nThe ground beneath the turtle and the figure scream away at great\nspeed and the two bodies appear to be suspended over the movement.\n\n\nWittily and pungently Lin points to the ultimate source of\nexcellence: solar illumination and energy!\n\n\nIt is in conversation a la carte, curtains up, do not disturb,\nfootball unmatched and shadow boxing that Lin reaches accomplished heights in\nthe present exhibition.\n\n\nAll the bodies and pictures are articulated in their entirety; they\nconnect with one another through gestures, glances and bodily attitudes and\nyet retain their respective spaces and presences.\n\n\nThey do not require delineated spaces in an architectonic sense they\ndefine their spatiality through their actions and the created occasion\nsufficiently, and without ostentation. \n\n\nThe translucent rendering of the medium imbues these pictures with a\nsense of transitoriness ; time is not made concrete; or is it frozen by\ngrand, theatrical gestures.\n\n\nTime is fluid, flowing and elusive; the bodies constituting the\nnarratives congeal momentarily in order to convey an action or event and then\nthreaten to re-integrate into the flux of the medium and to become bodiless.\n\n\nSpace, time and bodies approach the condition of being erased.\n\n\nT K Sabapathy\n\n\nArt Historian\n\n\nSchool of Architecture\n\n\nNational University of Singapore", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '2ff4823e-1ea2-4e08-8f3c-410f3a2a656f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.834090+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9681620001792908, 'non_english_score': 0.03183799982070923}
{'text': 'TEACH YOUR CHILD \n\n\n A FUN WAY OF HELPING YOUR CHILD GAIN A HEADSTART IN LIFE \n\n\nLow Ming Choo\n\n\n STORY TELLING \n\n\n 8) Tell Me A Story \n\n\nThere is so much that can be got out of story-telling.\n\n\nIt is not just to entertain the child but also to feed him with\ninformation of his cultural background, to teach him moral values and to\nenhance family cohesiveness.\n\n\nThere are different types of stories and different ways of presenting\nthem.\n\n\nTo simplify things, stories could be categorized into family stories\nand classical stories.\n\n\n Family Stories \n\n\nThese stories give the child an idea of himself and the family he\nbelongs to.\n\n\n The child himself \n\n\nAs always, begin with the most familiar, which is, the child and his\nsurroundings.\n\n\nTell your child stories about himself as soon as he is old enough to\nunderstand.\n\n\nYou can even start with the labour room scenario - tell him his\nweight at birth and how he looked when he was born.\n\n\nTell him how you felt about that tiny " squealing bundle", and how\nDad was not sure how to carry him.\n\n\nHe looked so small and fragile then.\n\n\nShow him photographs of himself at that stage, if you have any, and\nsome of the presents he was given and who gave them to him.\n\n\nIf he is able to understand, tell him the symbolism of some gifts.\n\n\nThe little blankets and tiny gold anklets and bracelets from his\ngrandparents will fascinate him.\n\n\n" Was I that tiny?" he would ask.\n\n\nOne question will lead to the next and before you realize it, you\nwill have used up one side of a tape on the story of his birth.\n\n\nIf your child is old enough, you can even tell him of the customs\nyour family observes on the birth of a child.\n\n\nThe milestones of a child\'s development can be made into stories for\nhim.\n\n\nTell him of the time when he started teething.\n\n\nInclude the date and his exact age, if you can remember.\n\n\nHe could be irritable and bit at everything, including his elder\nsister.\n\n\nLet him know how his parents helped him through that difficult period\n- the teething biscuits and toys you bought for him to chew on.\n\n\nShow him his teething toys ( if you still have them) with his teeth\nmarks.\n\n\nHis next milestones are when he started to crawl, stand and walk.\n\n\nTell him what you had to do to accommodate his new skills.\n\n\nThis would include removing things out of his reach and helping him\nto cushion his falls.\n\n\nLet him know how he insisted on not being held when walking, even\nthough he was not steady on his feet, and how he wanted his independence, and\nsuffered many falls for it.\n\n\nLet him know how determined he was, and how he learnt very quickly to\nbreak his falls.\n\n\nHe could be climbing chairs too.\n\n\nTell him of the accidents if there were any, and how you had to buy\nhim very heavy chairs that would not topple as he climbed on them, and how he\nloved climbing stairs as well, that you had to line the steps with very thick\ncarpet and install child-safe doors at both ends of the stairs.\n\n\nTell him about the time when he started talking and how he tried\npronouncing his name and other family members\'.\n\n\nWe still tease our daughter about her " Que me, que me" when she\ntried to say " Excuse me".\n\n\nYou might have some recordings of his early utterances.\n\n\nPerhaps you could prompt him to talk or sing, to show him how he has\nimproved.\n\n\nBesides the milestones of his development, talk about incidents that\npunctuated his life: measles, his first encounter with a particular food,\nlike durian, or with an animal he had not seen, or his first ride on a Ferris\nwheel or a kiddy machine or even the lift.\n\n\nThere are so many firsts in his life that you can talk to him about.\n\n\nYou can practically turn everything that happened into stories for\nhim.\n\n\n Parents \n\n\nDelve as far as possible into your childhood for incidents of\ninterest to him.\n\n\nA younger child would like to compare situations between himself and\nhis parents.\n\n\n" When did Mummy start to walk?\n\n\nWas it at the same age as I?" are some of the usual questions.\n\n\nIt thrills him to see photographs of you as a child, your old toys,\nclothes and the things you used.\n\n\nMy daughter who can sprint, loves to compare herself with her father\nwho was an athlete during his younger days.\n\n\nIn such a situation, there is so much material to build stories on.\n\n\nThere are trophies, photographs and old school magazines to prompt\nDad on to yet another story of " When I was".\n\n\nI could see how her eyes would glow with pride for a father who could\ndo so much.\n\n\n School \n\n\nThere is so much of your school life that you would like to tell your\nchild.\n\n\nThis includes the talentime, camps, school concerts and trips that\nyou participated in.\n\n\nTelling him about each occasion brings to mind the friends and\nteachers involved.\n\n\nThis will inevitably take you to the description of the place where\nit all happened.\n\n\nPhotographs help with the narration.\n\n\nReference to former classmates who are familiar to him helps too.\n\n\nAgain, be careful about the scrapes you got yourself into unless you\ndo not mind your child doing the same.\n\n\n Home \n\n\nMemories of your own childhood days would not be too difficult to\nrecall.\n\n\nThey make interesting stories especially when they were spent in an\nenvironment that is entirely different from what your child is experiencing\nnow.\n\n\nThe difficulty lies in where to begin and who to begin with.\n\n\nIt is easier to use yourself as the main subject, and then find an\noccasion to work out a story.\n\n\nThen other people around you will just fall into place.\n\n\nTake an example:\n\n\nWhen Mummy was six years old, she had a fall and knocked her big toe\nnail out.\n\n\n( Question: Did it hurt?) Yes, it did.\n\n\nI was very much a tomboy and loved running around with the\nneighbourhood children.\n\n\nThey were all older than I and were boys.\n\n\nI tried to do everything they did.\n\n\nYoung girls did not usually have the freedom I had.\n\n\nIt was just that I was Grandma\'s first grandchild and I was allowed\nto do many things.\n\n\n( There were lots of questions here about why I was allowed so much\nfreedom and what else I did).\n\n\nOne day the children decided to do something very naughty.\n\n\nThere was a wide monsoon drain in front of Grandpa\'s house.\n\n\nThey challenged each other to cross it by balancing on the small\nwater-pipe which ran across it.\n\n\nThey went first.\n\n\nAll of them crossed it safely.\n\n\nThen it was my turn.\n\n\nI was scared.\n\n\nI did not like the look of the water rushing below in the drain.\n\n\nBut I did not want to be called a coward.\n\n\nSo I took my steps, balancing on the same pipe.\n\n\nWhen I was half-way through, Grandma came.\n\n\nI tried to hurry across and fell...not into the drain, but on the\nopposite side of it.\n\n\nThe big toe bled.\n\n\nI screamed.\n\n\nThat was the best way to avoid being disciplined.\n\n\nHowever, I did hurt myself.\n\n\nI found my big toe nail loose, hanging on only by a bit of the toe\nskin.\n\n\n Classics \n\n\nAs family stories increase a child\'s awareness of himself, classical\nstories and folklore prepare him for an understanding of his own culture.\n\n\nBesides, the child is bound to encounter reference to figures and\nsituations from classical stories later on.\n\n\n Folklore and mythology \n\n\nJust as a Christian child grows up with Bible stories, a Hindu child\nis equipped with those from the Ramayana and of the different deities of the\nHindu mythology.\n\n\nThe same goes for Muslim child, and a child from a Buddhist-Taoist\nfamily.\n\n\nBeside these, there are moral stories as well as tales of romance\nand heroism in each culture.\n\n\nThere is also folklore particular to the region where the family\ncomes from.\n\n\nThus there is so much each individual has from his heritage.\n\n\nIn our multi-cultural society, influenced by western education and\nmedia, there is a grave danger of an individual losing his cultural roots.\n\n\nA child needs to be taught his heritage early, or it would be\ndifficult to force it upon him when the influence of other cultures sets in.\n\n\nOne effective way is by telling him stories.\n\n\nA busy parent who feels that she does not have enough time for her\nchild can stretch her time by telling stories onto cassette tapes.\n\n\nShe can pitch the stories at the level her child can understand, and\npersonalize them with the child\'s responses and queries, and her reference to\nhim.\n\n\n Classics in English \n\n\n1) What to tell - Though it is best to teach one\'s own heritage, in\none\'s own mother tongue, there are some of us who are not properly schooled\nin it to be sufficiently proficient.\n\n\nThere is a whole wide range of classics in the English language that\nwill never grow old.\n\n\nTo name a few: · Children\'s classics, like The Ugly Duckling,\nCinderella, Snow White, and Jack and the Bean Stalk.\n\n\nAesop\'s Fables, like The Dog and His Reflection.\n\n\nBible stories.\n\n\nTranslations of stories from Chinese, Indian, Malay, Greek, and\nRoman mythologies.\n\n\nSimplified tales from Shakespeare.\n\n\nThe mythologies which may appear rather formidable can be\nsimplified.\n\n\nThe child may be about five years old when you tell him these\nstories.\n\n\nIt does not matter if many details need to be left out.\n\n\nThe purpose is to give him the main story line with emphases only on\nparts of the stories that interest him.\n\n\nIt would be enough for him just to know who Cinderella, Hang Tuah,\nSita, the Monkey God, or Helen of Troy is.\n\n\nAs these stories are classics, he will hear or read about them again\nand again, each time learning more.\n\n\nThe purpose of recommending classics over other stories is to\nprepare him for the original versions and for understanding references made\nto them, both in literature and in common day-to-day situations, like: · I\ncan\'t afford it, I need a fairy godmother to help me out.\n\n\nI cannot wear the shoes, I don\'t have Cinderella\'s feet.\n\n\nShe thinks she\'s Helen of Troy.\n\n\nHe has the wisdom of Pao Kung.\n\n\nYou need Samson to lift this.\n\n\nThus with some basic knowledge of the classics, the child\'s level of\ncomprehension is increased as he listens to adult speech, and when he starts\nto read by himself.\n\n\nOf course, this does not mean leaving out popular characters from\nMother Goose, Disneyland and Sesame Street.\n\n\nThere are so many picture story books about these characters.\n\n\nThe fact that they have been around for so long makes them classics\ntoo.\n\n\nHowever, these are more suitable for the child when he is younger,\nsay, two or three years old.\n\n\nSome children grow out of them sooner than others.\n\n\nBut use them for as long as the child wants them, together with the\nfairy tales.\n\n\n2) How to tell - For a child less than two years old, you could use\na picture book to tell the story.\n\n\nOf course, the choice of subject must be of interest to him, and the\nlanguage level an l the speed of narration must suit him.\n\n\nFor a two-year-old, you would not read the text in the book, but\ntell the story from the pictures, changing your tone of voice to match the\ncharacter and using sound effects for excitement.\n\n\nYou could prompt the child to help you.\n\n\nTake for example, in the Three Little Pigs, the wolf would have a\ngruff voice, the little pigs, cute voices and the mother pig a sweet voice.\n\n\nWhen the wolf knocks on the door of a little pig, you could knock on\nthe table to produce the sound and prompt your child to help you. \n\n\nWhen you tell about the wolf blowing the house down, you could blow\ninto the microphone, and prompt him to do the same.\n\n\nThe story would then not be a monotonous drone, but a lively\npresentation with the child\'s participation.\n\n\nWhen the child is ready to be introduced to print, read the story\nto him, pointing to each word as you go along.\n\n\nThe book might have been used many times before, and the story is,\ntherefore, familiar to him.\n\n\nBut it is easier for him to match spoken words with the written\nwords then.\n\n\nReading skills are picked up this way.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '2402be82-62c6-4fee-a7f5-06a0285c17da', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.835236+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9891197085380554, 'non_english_score': 0.01088029146194458}
{'text': 'Stop this criminal act  \n\n\n  IRAQ  \'s regional ambitions are not new.\n\n\nWhat is startling is the crude simplicity of the first step it has\ntaken towards realising them.\n\n\nTransforming an economic dispute with Kuwait into a military\none, Baghdad yesterday simply invaded its small neighbour reportedly forcing\nthe Emir to flee the country and installing a so-called  free\ngovernment  .\n\n\nIraqi President Saddam Hussein has lived up to his critics\'\ndescription of him as unpredictable and undependable.\n\n\nWhat remains to be seen is what the rest of the world can do about the\nman, his regime, what they stand for in the Middle East and what they mean\nfor the rest of the world. \n\n\n International reactions have been strong.\n\n\nThe UN Security Council met to condemn the invasion and demand the\nunconditional withdrawal of the Iraqi troops.\n\n\nMany nations have responded with sharp criticism.\n\n\nUS President George Bush has termed the invasion an act of " naked\naggression" and has signed an order freezing control of Iraqi assets in the\nUS and blocking almost all imports from that country.\n\n\nThe Soviet Union has called for the immediate and unconditional\nwithdrawal of the Iraqi forces.\n\n\nBritain and France have roundly condemned the Iraqi action.\n\n\nThe Arab states are meeting to decide on a response.\n\n\nIsrael, a traditional target of Iraqi ire, has declared that it is\nprepared to meet any attack.\n\n\nSingapore has strongly condemned the invasion, calling it a blatant\ndisregard of the UN Charter and other fundamental principles of international\nlaw that is a threat to the security of small states everywhere. \n\n\n Indeed, everybody everywhere should be concerned at the implications of\nthe Iraqi action.\n\n\nIt is a reminder, in these times when peace is said to be breaking\nout the world over, that the deep-rooted realities of international conflict\nwill not disappear just because there is super-power peg to hang them on.\n\n\nWhat is happening, rather, is that the dissolution of US Soviet\nrivalry is taking the lid off a veritable Pandora\'s box of local and\nregional conflicts which are steeped in history, culture and the\npersonality of rulers.\n\n\nIf the nuclear balance between East and West was one of terror, it\nwas also, thankfully, a balance.\n\n\nSmaller fry with big guns, who have no stake in an\ninternational balance of power, have correspondingly fewer\nqualms about breaking the\npeace around them if they think that others will accept the situation as a\nfait accompli. \n\n\n Unless something is done about this terrible disease, the primary\nrequirements of civilised international behaviour will be drowned in a flood\nof spreading anarchy.\n\n\nIt is the UN which, as the highest forum of international relations,\nshould play the leading role in getting Iraq out of Kuwait and restoring\npower to the emirate\'s legitimate rulers.\n\n\nThe Arab nations have a special responsibility in this regard, but\neveryone should cooperate, for Kuwait must not be allowed to set a\nprecedent for that most horrendous of international crimes: invasion.\n \n\n\n\n  Defence is the only defence  \n\n\n GOOD defences are like good teeth.\n\n\nBoth are hardly noticed while they are there; it is only when\nthe malfunctioning begins that they are missed.\n\n\nThe need for a country to have teeth is therefore an entirely apt\nmetaphor, as Kuwaitis today would be the first to acknowledge.\n\n\nBut today is already too late.\n\n\nDefence is what you thought of yesterday and maintain today to meet\nthe possible dangers of tomorrow.\n\n\nIn saying that Singapore must never allow itself to become another\nKuwait, First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong correctly reiterated the\ncrucial importance of a good defence system to national sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity. \n\n\n The comparison with Kuwait has a specific validity.\n\n\nBoth the kingdom and Singapore are small states which cannot threaten\nanyone but can only be threatened by others; the prosperity of both\ndraws not only public commendation but, it might be suspected, a\nmeasure of private jealousy in certain foreign political quarters; and both\nnations are part of regions where peace and stability are far from\npermanently guaranteed, especially in times of rapid global change.\n\n\nIn Kuwait\'s case, the absence of effective national defence turned\neach of these factors against the country.\n\n\nThe lesson is that Singapore must never allow such a thing to happen\nto itself. \n\n\n Defence needs a good - that is, well-trained and well-equipped -\nmilitary, which is why Mr Goh said that Singaporeans should take National\nService seriously and not press for the period of service to be shortened.\n\n\nBut defence, to be truly effective, has to go beyond military\ndeterrence.\n\n\nAn active, alert diplomacy is required to plug the country into the\ninternational political grid, primarily the UN.\n\n\nIn Singapore\'s case, the international element has been\nemphasised also by giving great powers a stake in the Republic\'s economic\nprogress and hence in its security.\n\n\nOngoing attempts at closer economic interaction with neighbouring\ncountries should give them a similar stake in Singapore\'s prosperity.\n\n\nStrengthening Asean should create another layer of protection. \n\n\n All these are external factors which can be underpinned only by social\nsolidarity and political stability at home.\n\n\nA country is like a family.\n\n\nDifferences of race and creed - like personal and intellectual\ndifferences in families - are there in Singapore, but if these take\nprecedence over the existence of the national family as a tangible,\nrecognisable entity, the seeds of destruction would have been planted without\nenemies abroad having to lift a finger.\n\n\nThus the need for political stability, the need to recognise the\nworth of the government which has made Singapore worth defending.\n\n\nIt is necessary for Singaporeans to mull over these things,\nindividually and collectively.\n\n\nSingapore is too small to determine the nature of international\npolitics: it is not too small to survive the jungles where that nature roams\nwild, red in tooth and claw.  \n\n\n\n  Telling it like it is  \n\n\n AS PETROL prices jump at rates Singapore hasn\'t seen in more than\nfive years; oil companies are coming under heavy fire for profiteering,\nmaking a fast buck, and other unethical conduct.\n\n\nThe hikes themselves are hardly unexpected; the pressure behind the\nhikes is the crisis in the Middle East which is causing crude prices to rise\ndangerously.\n\n\nThe bone of contention is, of course that prices are being upped too\nquickly while reserves bought prior to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait are still\navailable.\n\n\nAlso, falling crude prices are not as quickly reflected in lower\nretail prices.\n\n\nBut market leader Shell has denied these accusations, backing\nthem up with statistics showing it was actually faster to reflect\nwholesale price drops in lower retail prices, and slower in pushing up pump\nprices when crude got more expensive. \n\n\n Business is about profits; to think otherwise would be naive.\n\n\nDeregulation of the oil industry has meant more than anything\nelse, an opportunity for more competition and, ultimately, fair\nprofits.\n\n\nThe petrol price hikes underway, we trust, are grounded in some\nlogic, most inherently rising costs.\n\n\nBut the hikes are having immediate inflationary effects which don\'t\nportend well for Singapore, particularly at a stage when economic growth is\nmoderating.\n\n\nAs private companies, oil majors here have no legal obligation to\ndisclose their profit models, or how they arrive at their pricing.\n\n\nBut it may be timely and appropriate for oil majors to take the\ninitiative to inform business and the public of the basis for this round of\nprice hikes. \n\n\n The consequences the hikes could potentially have on the economy\nand business competitiveness are immeasurable, particularly with no\neasy solution to the Middle East crisis in sight.\n\n\nAs tensions escalate, the oil supply situation in that region\nthreatens to become even more precarious, despite excess supply\ninternationally.\n\n\nAs an open economy which depends on its links to the outside world,\nSingapore is potentially in an equally precarious position.\n\n\nAt a time like this, a gesture of goodwill is necessary.\n\n\nIt would be in the interest of oil companies to take the initiative\nthis point to allay fears of profiteering, and reassure public confidence.\n\n\n\n Price hikes are never painless.\n\n\nBut it helps to understand the nature and the source of the pain.\n\n\nIt may be more painful to suffer in ignorance.\n\n\nOil majors have always held a distinctive stature in the local\neconomy.\n\n\nFor all practical purposes, they provide an essential service which\nSingapore depends on critically.\n\n\nConversely, oil companies, with their vast stakes here, also have a\nvested interest in Singapore\'s economic well-being.\n\n\nOil is business, big business.\n\n\nBut there must be an implicit trust, almost faith, that doing\nbusiness here is mutually beneficial, to the economy and to consumers.\n\n\nAs responsible corporate citizens, the onus is on oil companies to do\nthe right thing by Singapore.\n\n\nTell it like it is.  \n\n\n\n  S\'pore is better prepared  \n\n\n  THE  dramatic events sparked by Iraq\'s\ninvasion of Kuwait have only underlined Singapore\'s economic vulnerability.\n\n\nJust half a month ago, government officials were optimistically\nenvisaging growth of the economy reaching or even topping their higher-end\nprediction of 8 per cent for this year.\n\n\nLast week, in the wake of sharp stock and money market reaction\nworldwide to the invasion, the official projection was decidedly more\ncautious.\n\n\nThe new developments made it  much less likely that we will\nexceed 8 per cent growth in 1990  , the Ministry of Trade and\nIndustry said.\n\n\nStill, the MTI remained confident that its original forecast of\n6 to 8 per cent growth would be achieved, given the momentum from the\nfirst half of the year.\n\n\nBut local business was not much heartened, if the stock market was\nany indication.\n\n\nShare prices continued their downward spiral apace with\ninternational markets, and have shown rather less bounce on the upswing\ncompared to their regional and international counterparts. \n\n\n The fear of inflation fuelled by the surge in crude oil prices is only\none reason, and quite likely not the major one either.\n\n\nThere is a larger concern that the oil price hike could be the weight\nthat tips an already debt-heavy American economy into recession.\n\n\nJapanese growth, so dependent on imported oil, is a related worry.\n\n\nWith the first quarter having registered a marked slowdown in the\ngrowth of total trade - 6 per cent, from the 19 per cent of the previous\nquarter - a further weakening of the Republic\'s major markets is not\nsomething to relish. \n\n\n But if an international slowdown has to come, the encouraging news is\nthat Singapore is now in a better position to deal with it.\n\n\nLearning from the 1985/86 recession, it now has several mechanisms in\nplace to better deal with the vagaries of the international economy.\n\n\nBusiness indicators, at home and abroad, are more closely monitored,\nas are business costs in Singapore and the country\'s closest competitors.\n\n\nAnd there has been a marked improvement in the quality,\nfrequency and public availability of economic data, for better\ndecision-making in the private and public sectors. \n\n\n Then there is the flexi-wage system, potentially the most valuable\nof these mechanisms.\n\n\nFlexi-wages, properly designed and implemented, offer employer\nand employee the best guarantee of optimal remuneration even with large\nfluctuations in the national economy and hence company performance.\n\n\nIts advantage shows up most clearly when compared with blunt\ninstruments for the industry or economy, such as cuts in CPF contribution.\n\n\nUnder the flexi-wage system, the fine-tuning of remuneration\ncan be done at the company level can be applied earlier, and restored as\nquickly when circumstances improve.\n\n\nFor those companies still hesitating over implementing flexi-wages,\nthe incentive to do so should be stronger now.  \n\n\n\n  Closer to the precipice  \n\n\n  WHY  is it that the Middle East cannot\nrid its politics of terrorism?\n\n\nTaking people hostage, while not a monopoly of that region or areas\nclose to it, has been perfected there.\n\n\nLibya elevated terrorism to the level of a philosophy, and Iran\ngave the philosophy a nasty twist when it extended hostage-taking to\ndiplomats.\n\n\nNow comes Iraq holding thousands of foreigners ransom in a bid to\nprevent other countries from contesting a possible extension of its invasion\nof Kuwait into Saudi Arabia.\n\n\nThe Iraqi action is doubly reprehensible. \n\n\nWhereas earlier instances of terrorism possessed a\nsemi-anarchic quality - which does not legitimise them but at least explains\nsome of their ultra-revolutionary fervour - Mr Saddam Hussein\'s use of\nforeigners as a human shield blatantly utilises every legitimate\nresource of state power, publicly and cynically, to commit a patently illegal\nact.\n\n\nIf he gets away with this, we might as well cease speaking of\ncivilised international relations. \n\n\n What is ironic is that Mr Hussein, in his very extremism, has left others\nwith very few options.\n\n\nIn the absence of a viable alternative, the West may be forced to\ngive Iraq a quick sharp and decisive reply.\n\n\nThe response may consist of tactical strikes on essential military\nand other installations in Iraq with the aim of avoiding large civilian\ncasualties, but escalation - caused, for example, by Baghdad using chemical\nweapons - might lead to such unfortunate destruction.\n\n\nWithin the Western camp, the US might find itself taking the lead\nand perhaps even moving unilaterally if coordination with other\ncountries poses political difficulties and costly operational delays.\n\n\n\n Other factors suggest that Iraqi intransigence may force the West\'s\nhand.\n\n\nFirst, any pussy-footing by the Western powers will turn the\nspotlight on Israel, which has everything to fear from an expansionary Iraq,\nand probably lead to an Arab-lsraeli conflict profoundly destabilising\nto the international order.\n\n\nSecondly, while a war with Iraq will hurt the international\neconomy, the depth of that damage will be less than if a deadly uncertainty\ncontinues to hang over a bristling Middle East.\n\n\nThirdly, the Soviet Union and other countries, in spite of expected\nverbal condemnations of any major US move, are unlikely to contest it.\n\n\nLast, and certainly not least, the fate of the foreigners in Iraq\nand Kuwait is a horrifying reality, but if the price for their freedom is\nacceptance of terrorism, more people will pay in future at the hands of\ndictators who have smelt blood. \n\n\n What is at stake is the existence of a system of international behaviour\nbuilt up painstakingly since World War II.\n\n\nThe Iraqi aggression against Kuwait is a structural threat to that\nsystem which, for all its imperfections, has preserved global peace for the\npast 45 years.\n\n\nThe root of the problem in the Middle East today is Iraq\'s invasion\nof Kuwait.\n\n\nIf Baghdad really wants peace, it should withdraw from that\ncountry.\n\n\nThe choice is Iraq\'s.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3270bb72-4c3c-4f6e-892a-a50df0d1c27a', 'added':

for deterrent action to warn other\nwould-be bullies that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated. \n\n\n To be sure, the courts have dealt sternly with the cases that have come\nbefore them.\n\n\nThat, plus the publicity given to the cases, may perhaps be\nsufficient to give pause to potential bullies.\n\n\nBut it usually takes two sides to make a quarrel and in some of the\ncases, it would appear that the miscreants were provoked or even\nthreatened in the first place.\n\n\nAnd while they fully deserve the punishment they get, it does\nnot seem right that the other side should get off scot-free.\n\n\nCivility and order on the road, all the more important as traffic\ngrows, can only be obtained if everyone abides by the rules.\n\n\nThey would be more inclined to do that if they know that punishment\nfor violations will be evenly meted out.\n\n\n\n  Green roots of Singapore  \n\n\n THE amount of waste generated in Singapore continues to offend the\nsmall number of environmentally conscious people here.\n\n\nSome have appealed for a comprehensive recycling scheme.\n\n\nThis is a worthy goal, but before it can take off, Singapore\'s\nbudding environmental activists need to convince others not only of its need,\nbut also of its practicability.\n\n\nIn particular, how would it fit into existing structures and\ninstitutions?\n\n\nThe widely held view of environmentalism as an idealistic\npreoccupation of a few makes it especially important that the eco-activists\nfind domestic roots for a green Singapore. \n\n\n This may not be as difficult as it seems.\n\n\nSingapore already has an indigenous environmental tradition to\nbuild on, even if it was never called that.\n\n\nThe state has cleaned streets, planted trees, kept out polluting\nfactories, treated sewage and cleaned rivers.\n\n\nThe success of these schemes, which addressed the environmental\nproblems as perceived at the time, depended on a combination of\npublic works, legislation and public education.\n\n\nAnd these are the very elements needed for any nation-wide recycling\nprogramme.\n\n\nThe precedents are encouraging. \n\n\n Nor can environmentalists afford to ignore the private sector.\n\n\nAfter all, the people at the frontline of environmentalism in\nSingapore are really the rag-andbone men who make the rounds of residential\nareas in search of recyclable paper.\n\n\nIdentifying the conditions that make this a profitable business\nin Singapore - it is not so in many other cities - could well point the way\nforward for environmentalists.\n\n\nIn turning Singapore\'s attention to new environmental\nchallenges, they need to build on the environmental tradition that\nalready exists.  \n\n\n\n  What a world to inherit  \n\n\n CHILDREN are the new international underclass.\n\n\nWhen they do not die at birth, poor children are forced into early\nadulthood without the physical and mental protection age brings, to work in\nthe marketplace, to fight wars, to help run drug rings, to go into\nprostitution.\n\n\nVenerated as the conscience and the future of the world, children are\nborn into a world without a conscience and a future, as it must seem to the\nmany Oliver Twists of today.\n\n\nThey suffer from poverty and crime not only in the developing\ncountries; children in the developed world, too, are scarred by\nhomelessness, loneliness and alienation.\n\n\nChildren do not have the vote, so their interests are not crucial to\npoliticians; kids cannot organise themselves, so they do not threaten the\nstate into ameliorative action.\n\n\nThe language of this underclass is a silence more awesome than words\ncan tell. \n\n\n The lot of the Singapore child is far better.\n\n\nRecognised as the only resource this country has, he is well fed,\nhoused, educated and generally well looked after.\n\n\nStrong family ties ensure that he lives not just in a house but in a\nhome.\n\n\nWhile some parents err on the side of softness, as others do on the\nside of the rod, the general ethos is balanced.\n\n\nThere are juvenile problems, but they do not subvert the basis\nof social life.\n\n\nThese are mercies whose worth is magnified many times over when\nSingaporeans look at the world. \n\n\n Today, more than 70 leaders from countries across the globe will\nmeet at the United Nations in New York to discuss the plight of children.\n\n\nThey should do so without politics intervening in the search for\nsolutions.\n\n\nNational governments, as well as the private organisations\nwhich sometimes are the only hope of these tragic children, have much to do\nto restore to the child his childhood - so that he can be a better father of\nthe man.  \n\n\n\n  Leaden answer  \n\n\n PERHAPS it was just a slip of the tongue.\n\n\nIf not, then Environment Minister Ahmad Mattar did himself and the\nGovernment injustice by the way he answered a question in Parliament last\nweek on unleaded petrol.\n\n\nHe had just announced that the Government would promote its use in\nSingapore.\n\n\nIt is a step that everyone is likely to applaud because, as he\nreminded the House, studies have shown that exposure to high concentrations\nof lead can do nasty things to people, especially children.\n\n\nBut the problem is that unleaded petrol costs more to produce.\n\n\nAnd experience in other countries, including environmentconscious\nGermany, shows that drivers will not voluntarily convert to the\ncleaner fuel if it costs them more.\n\n\nHow, then, can Singapore\'s motorists be encouraged to make the\nswitch? \n\n\n The answer, in Dr Mattar\'s words, is to  create a price\ndifferential in favour of unleaded petrol  .\n\n\nIn plain language, make unleaded cheaper than leaded.\n\n\nThe question is how?\n\n\nThe obvious and most equitable way, one would have thought, is to\nreduce the duty on unleaded, at least till such time that Singaporeans have\ngrown accustomed to using it and will continue to do so as a matter of\ncourse.\n\n\nTrue, it might mean a loss of revenue for the taxman.\n\n\nBut the increase in oil price since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has\nalready given the Government an unexpected windfall which should go some way,\nperhaps even fully, to compensate for the loss.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the Government does not look at it this way.\n\n\nSo along with the lowering of duty for unleaded petrol, it also\nintends levying an additional duty on the leaded variety. \n\n\n That might not be very objectionable if all cars in Singapore can switch.\n\n\nThen those wilfully refusing to yield to the lure of cheaper\nunleaded deserve to be hit by the extra tax.\n\n\nBut as Dr Mattar pointed out, this is not the case: some 10 per cent\nor 32,000 of the petroldriven cars on the road today are older than seven\nyears and  cannot  use unleaded petrol.\n\n\nTheir owners are thus being penalised unfairly in the drive for\ncleaner air, a point two MPs made.\n\n\nTheoretically, one could easily defend this.\n\n\nIt is hardly the first time that a section of the population, through\nno fault of its own, has had to suffer unfairness for the greater good of the\ncountry.\n\n\nLand owners, for instance, have periodically had their property\nacquired, for road widening or re-development.\n\n\nAnd pig farmers, not too long ago, had to give up their way of\nlife to make for a cleaner Singapore.\n\n\nIt may be unfair, but Singaporeans realise and can accept that this\nis the way life is sometimes. \n\n\n\n Sadly, Dr Mattar apparently did not think the MPs\' objections were of\nsufficient gravity.\n\n\nHis answer was a specious non-answer.\n\n\nThe  majority  of the affected cars,\nhe said,  belong to the category of BMWs, the Mercedes and so\non.\n\n\nAnd so I think they should have no problem in paying \n.\n\n\nThis reply cannot but beg a host of further questions.\n\n\nFor example, what has a person\'s ability to pay got to do with\nthe issue?\n\n\nIs one to conclude that in this instance, the underlying thinking is\none of soaking the rich?\n\n\nIf so, is the criterion ownership of certain brands of cars,\nregardless of model or age?\n\n\nWill it apply to areas other than duty on petrol?\n\n\nWhat does he mean by " majority"?\n\n\nWhat about the rest, the cheaper makes of cars?\n\n\nDo their owners get a rebate?\n\n\nBut instead of asking these and more, the MPs seemed to think that\nDr Mattar\'s reply was amusing and laughed heartily at it.\n\n\nBut it is no laughing matter, either to owners of those big cars or\nto Singaporeans who expect more from their MPs, especially now that they have\nbeen grouped into committees to help them tackle issues more\neffectively and in greater depth.\n\n\nThe opportunity had presented itself for MPs to demonstrate to\nSingaporeans that they could be counted on to raise pertinent issues\nand press home their arguments on ministers - and not let the latter get away\nwith wishy-washy answers.\n\n\nSadly, they let it pass.  \n\n\n\n  Rules to heed all concerns  \n\n\n FOR many young parents in Singapore, the daunting task of getting\ntheir child into a top-rated school begins at birth or before, the\ncompetitiveness of primary school admission being what it is.\n\n\nFor the past decade, parents and school administrators have\ncoped bravely, though not silently, with a tortuously complicated set of\nrules which puts children into six sub-categories under three phases of\nregistration for school entry.\n\n\nThe planned revision of these rules, the details of which areeagerly\nawaited, is therefore timely and welcome.  \n\n\n Entry to school in Singapore has been used since the 1960s as a tool of\npopulation planning.\n\n\nFirst, this was an effective means of controlling the size of the\npopulation increase in the stop-at-two era.\n\n\nLater, it was used for selective population control to enhance the\nquality of the increase by encouraging the better educated both to procreate\nand, if they already had a child, to have more children.\n\n\nThis was the aim of the graduate mother policy.\n\n\nThe last revision to the rules in 1987 came when the population\npolicy turned to exhorting young, bettereducated couples to have three or\nmore children if they could afford them.\n\n\nSingaporeans have been mostly responsive to the incentives and\ndisincentives wielded by the school admission criteria.\n\n\nThey had themselves sterilised, either temporarily or permanently,\nand had no more than two children.\n\n\nLater, graduate women began to have more children than just two\nthough it is uncertain if this was sufficient to offset the numbers of third,\nfourth or fifth children born of less-educated women.\n\n\nRemnants of the earlier policies, though no longer relevant, had to\nremain until their effects had worked themselves out of the system.\n\n\nThese have complicated the current rules. \n\n\n Both the Minister and the Minister of State for Education have indicated\nthat the revised criteria would give greater weight to education than to\nfamily considerations.\n\n\nThree criteria have been singled out: having a sibling in the\nschool of choice, having parents connected to the school and living near the\nschool.\n\n\nIt is difficult to fault these criteria in themselves since they\npromise parents an easier time, with less travelling and shuttling between\nschools, and encourage parents to be more involved in school activities.\n\n\nThey do focus on educational considerations in a broad sense and\nthey serve the interests of parents more than the demands of state planning.\n\n\nBut there can be unwelcome effects to policies based too\nsimplistically on such criteria.\n\n\nEducation policy-makers and professionals must know well that such\npolicies, in a system where schools vary greatly in the quality of education\nthey provide, may reduce the spread of educational opportunity to less\nequitable levels than before. \n\n\n True, no set of rules, no matter how well it balances competing\ninterests, can please all parents, or serve the more immediate individual\nconvenience and preferences of parents as well as the larger interests of the\nstate.\n\n\nThe criterion of connection to the school, for instance, is likely\nto work to the advantage of the wealthy and the socially privileged: Hence\nthe fear already expressed by parents who do not belong to this class.\n\n\nSchool admission is, understandably, an emotional issue for the\nmajority.\n\n\nAnd yet there are no easy formulas to resolve the problem.\n\n\nBalloting, but within quotas, may be one way, but competitive entry\nexaminations for five-year-olds are, emphatically, not.\n\n\nPolicy-makers will have to resist simplifying the rules merely to\nmake them easier to administer or more convenient for parents.\n\n\nIt is correct to disregard, or at least give less weight to, social\npolicy considerations such as family size and educational qualifications of\nparents, but criteria for entry to primary school must spread the best\neducational opportunity as fairly as it is possible to manage.\n\n\nThis will satisfy many, if not most, parents and ensure that more\nof the country\'s talent is nurtured than would be in a system where privilege\npulls too much weight.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL',

{'text': 'Creative business  \n\n\n IMAGINE you are in a cramped, little-known watering hole, on stage with\nyour band.\n\n\nThe spotlights are shining and you are belting out a Madonna hit.\n\n\nSeveral people approach you after your performance.\n\n\nThey say you have talent.\n\n\nThey want to promote and develop you.\n\n\nThey will help you get contracts at good nightclubs.\n\n\nYou will make a lot of money...\n\n\nThis, for many budding musicians in Singapore is the stuff dreams are\nmade of.\n\n\nBut it might well be a reality now.\n\n\nSince early this year, a team of people have been sussing out local\ncreative talent.\n\n\nThey look out for, and nurture, those with a flair not only in the\nfield of music but in acting, dancing, painting, movie-making, song writing,\ncinematography and design.\n\n\nThese people are officers from the 10-month-old Economic Development\nBoard\'s Creative Services Strategic Business Unit ( SBU).\n\n\nTheir mission: to invest in worthy creative talent and generate a\ncreative services industry as part of Singapore\'s continuing economic\ndevelopment. \n\n\n The setting up of the Creative Services SBU is timely.\n\n\nNo one can disagree that, for far too long, creative talent has been\nignored as a factor in Singapore\'s economy.\n\n\nThose in the creative fields, be they singers, actors, dancers or\npainters, have generally found it unprofitable to make a living out of their\nart.\n\n\nAt best it is a vocation, but hardly ever a career.\n\n\nThe often cited reasons include the lack of financial backing,\nopportunities and people to manage them.\n\n\nSociety too has traditionally placed little value on a career in the\narts, giving priority instead to more stable professions like engineering,\nmedicine and law.\n\n\nWhile this is true in many countries, it is true to a much greater\ndegree in a developing nation like Singapore, which has had to concentrate\nmost of its resources and energies on material achievements. \n\n\n Over the past five years, however, there has been a slow, but sure,\nblossoming of the local arts scene.\n\n\nNote the number of local singers, actors, writers, playwrights and\nphotographers who have emerged.\n\n\nNote too the growing clout of local fashion designers.\n\n\nIn recent years, the Government has also spoken much about its\nvision of Singapore in the 1990s as a society of gracious, cultured people.\n\n\nThe impending formation of the Ministry of Information and the Arts\nand the establishment of the National Arts Council are further signs of this\nnew emphasis on the aesthetic side of life. \n\n\n In light of this, there is a dire need for an organ like the Creative\nServices SBU to home in on a potentially important industry.\n\n\nIndeed, armed with what has been termed an  arsenal of\nincentives  like tax reliefs and training grants, the unit has\nalready embarked on several ambitious projects.\n\n\nIt has made remarkable headway in the movie-making field, which has\nidentified as having the most potential to take off.\n\n\nThe lucrative foreign investments it has secured include the\nsetting up of Hongkong actor Eric Tsang\'s Movie Impact Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\n\nThe unit has also encouraged Golden Harvest to set up a multiplex\ncinema theatre in Yishun New Town as well as the building of a\n&dollar;50 million Tang Dynasty Village in Jurong which will house three movie\nstudios.\n\n\nBut a word of caution must be sounded.\n\n\nThe Creative Services SBU must remember that while it is not its aim\nto be a champion of the arts, or an instigator of social change, it cannot\ndeny its indirect role in shaping the cultural life and tastes of\nSingaporeans.\n\n\nThe artistic merit of any project it wants to embark on must always\nbe given due consideration.\n\n\nQuality should not give way to commercial viability, and there must\nbe a stringent artistic base-line standard which it must follow.\n\n\nIt is also to be hoped that the unit will not devote too much of its\nresources on big organisations with big bucks.\n\n\nWhile they are the ones who can bring in millions of dollars to the\neconomy, there are also many talented individual artistes out\nthere waiting to be given attention and help.  \n\n\n\n  Designs on the future  \n\n\n  MADE in Singapore.  Will the label become world-famous\nfor good design?\n\n\nThat is the exciting goal of the Singapore Design Council, to\nbe set up next year by the Trade Development Board.\n\n\nThe goal of design excellence is ambitious, but the challenge must be\nfaced head on.\n\n\nAptly, the establishment of the council was announced last\nThursday at the opening of the Second International Design Forum.\n\n\nThe conference, which ended on Saturday, provided ample evidence that\nonly with a serious commitment to better design can Singapore industry\nmake it in the big league.\n\n\nFrom television sets to telephones, coffee pots to children\'s\nslides, the goods on display showed the high standards of design that\nSingapore manufacturers must strive for.\n\n\nFrom next year, their efforts will be supported by the design\ncouncil, which will include an Institute of Design at the Nanyang\nTechnological University, and a Design Centre. \n\n\n There is of course no single approach to good design.\n\n\nThis too, was demonstrated at last week\'s exhibition in the sheer\nrange of products and styles.\n\n\nAt the United Kingdom pavilion stood the suit of armour worn by\nKenneth Branagh in his movie production of William Shakespeare\'s Henry V,\nwhich won this year\'s Academy Award for costume design.\n\n\nAcross the hall, at the Japanese pavilion, was a display of the\nlatest in personal computer graphics.\n\n\nIncluded was an architect\'s and engineer\'s dream tool: a\ncomputer-aided-design package for three dimensional simulations,\ncapable of generating 16 million shades of colour.\n\n\nGood design can therefore mean anything from hand-crafting a replica\nof a 15th-century outfit that is part of a nation\'s heritage, to using\nkeyboard and mouse to produce images of future products that exist only in\nthe imagination. \n\n\n But no matter what the industry, the proposed Design Council can have\nreal impact across the board if it can establish in the minds of present and\nfuture manufacturers that   design adds value   ,\nas the theme of last week\'s conference put it.\n\n\nIt can also help by showing that design is not like a coat of paint\nadded as an afterthought at the end of the manufacturing process, or, worse,\nclever packaging to hide shoddy workmanship.\n\n\nInstead, good design, if it is to win the confidence and\nloyalty of increasingly discerning consumers, has to be incorporated into\nevery stage of the production process.\n\n\nAs important, there needs to be a recognition that good industrial\ndesign differs from art in one crucial respect: Form never gets in the\nway of function.\n\n\nSome of the entries for the Young Designers Award showed that\ncreative energy needs to be tempered with a sense of practicality.\n\n\nGood design is more than just aesthetics; it is also about\nvalue to the user. \n\n\n As for the proposed Design Centre, it could play a valuable role in\nraising the design consciousness of local producers and consumers.\n\n\nAs one designer who spoke at last week\'s conference noted, many\npoorly designed products in the world today are copies of other poorly\ndesigned products.\n\n\nA Design Centre that serves as a repository of good design will help\nto break the cycle, providing a reference point and helping to raise\nstandards. \n\n\n A final plea should be made on behalf of the Singapore consumer.\n\n\nThe Trade Development Board has said that the design council would\nimprove Singapore\'s competitiveness in world markets.\n\n\nThe domestic consumer should not be forgotten.\n\n\nFor too long, Singaporeans have come under what could be called\ndesign imperialism.\n\n\nThe tyranny of foreign design has imposed on Singapore materials and\ndesigns quite unsuited to local conditions.\n\n\nExamples range from video-cassettes which are very quickly\nattacked by fungus in the heat and humidity, to the  Fall Collection\n syndrome, of totally inappropriate seasonal fashions from\nEurope and North America.\n\n\nIf the design council nurtures an independent and talented pool\nof local designers able to meet Singaporeans\' practical and sophisticated\nneeds with more appropriate colours, styles and materials, that in\nitself would be a major success.  \n\n\n\n  Encore, sponsors  \n\n\n THE applause was short-lived for a recently concluded series of\nplays by TheatreWorks, but not because audiences were unappreciative.\n\n\nNight after night, members of TheatreWorks, Singapore\'s main\nprofessional drama group, interrupted the applause to make impassioned pleas\nfor funds.\n\n\nPartly because of the sudden withdrawal of one corporate sponsor, the\ngroup found itself short of\n&dollar;93.000 for renovations of its new premises at Fort Canning Hill.\n\n\nTheatreWorks\' plight draws attention to the wider issue of\nfunding for the Arts in general.\n\n\nThe situation may only get worse.\n\n\nWith an economic slowdown looming, it could well be the arts that\nsuffer as corporate backers pull out and audiences stay away. \n\n\n Finding the money for the finer things is a universal problem, but it is\nespecially salient in Singapore, where the arts scene is at a critical stage.\n\n\nFor perhaps the first time, it seems that all the right ingredients\nhave been assembled and are simmering in the cultural pot, promising a rich\nand varied diet of artistic offerings in years to come.\n\n\nThe signs have never been more encouraging.\n\n\nOn the part of audiences, the Singapore public is showing its growing\nappetite for local performing arts, including the fairly serious.\n\n\nSingapore Symphony Orchestra concerts are generally sold\nout, as was the Retrospective series of experimental plays by TheatreWorks.\n\n\nOn the part of practitioners, a corps of talented Singaporeans is\nclearly demonstrating a passionate commitment to their art.\n\n\nMost are part-timers, filling their evenings with demanding\nrehearsals and performances at the end of their regular day-jobs.\n\n\nAs for institutional backers, many are beginning to express their\nfaith in the future of Singapore arts.\n\n\nFor example, the British Council, instead of simply bringing in\nBritish companies to perform, is inviting directors to work with Singaporean\ntheatre companies and to conduct theatre courses. \n\n\n The final and easily the most important ingredient in this bubbling\nbroth has been a government that is increasingly supportive of the arts.\n\n\nIt has stated its intention to make Singapore a place where the arts\ncan flourish, and that Singaporeans have a legitimate need for\nself-expression and enjoyment of cultural activities.\n\n\nIt has backed this up by, for example, featuring cultural\nfacilities prominently in its master plan for the Civic District.\n\n\nIt has poured in\n&dollar;1.07 million to convert an old powerhouse into The Substation, a\nprivately-run multi-cultural arts centre.\n\n\nThe Government\'s perception of its role is refreshingly\nprogressive.\n\n\nIt wants to facilitate rather than prescribe, providing a framework\nwithin which the arts can blossom unhampered by bureaucracy, although\nthis also means that arts groups cannot expect blank cheques from government.\n\n\n\n The momentum must be kept up.\n\n\nAudiences should be prepared to experiment, to stretch their tastes\nrather than patronise only activities which they know beforehand they will\nenjoy.\n\n\nArtistes need to produce better quality work, and more of it.\n\n\nMore urgently, they need strong administrative back-up, to reach out\nto sponsors and ensure that they are well managed and fiscally responsible.\n\n\nGovernment might be able to do more.\n\n\nThe licensing system may need to be reviewed, as the Advisory\nCouncil on Culture and the Arts has proposed.\n\n\nThere continues to be some unhappiness among artistes that tax-exempt\nstatus is not granted liberally enough, or in a clearly understood way.\n\n\nIn the end, however, it may be private sponsors who will decide if\nthe fledgling arts scene flourishes or shrivels.\n\n\nNow that the arts are just about to really take off, it would be\ntragic if they suddenly find themselves stalled because sponsors and would-be\nsponsors are less generous with support in the economic downturn.\n\n\nInstead of the culturally vibrant society it is on the way to\nbecoming, Singapore could again revert to a cultural desert.\n\n\nIt must not be allowed to happen.  \n\n\n\n  What makes a film artistic?  \n\n\n  WHEN  film classification was first\nintroduced on July 1, the film censor\'s only headache was deciding\nwhat scene would be considered too explicit to be passed untouched.\n\n\nNow with the amended R(A) rating, the censor\'s work will be even\nmore complicated: just what is an artistic movie?  \n\n\nWhen the Government heeded public sentiment and called for a stop\nto the flood of " soft-porn" movies flooding local cinemas, it perhaps\nthought it was coming to an ideal compromise.\n\n\nIt would stop all the rubbish from coming in, yet give serious\nmovie-goers some leeway by allowing the " good" stuff in.\n\n\nThis ideal might work better if there existed clear-cut guidelines\nas to what makes a movie artistic.\n\n\nSo far, the guidelines have been general.\n\n\nA movie qualifies for the R(A) rating if it has a good storyline,\nis not exploitative, violent or erotic.\n\n\nIt should be critically acclaimed and have a credible cast.\n\n\nThe reality, though, is that one critic\'s good movie is another\ncritic\'s toilet roll.\n\n\nIt is very easy to weed out the usual rubbish such as Amy Yip\'s\nstrip-and-stare movies.\n\n\nWhat is less easy to identify, though, is the movie that considers\nitself artistic, but in reality does not come close.\n\n\nTake Zandalee, a movie currently showing and which would have made\nit to the screen under the R(A) rating.\n\n\nThe movie is about a frustrated wife who seeks a lover, a theme\nwhich wlll not have many parents jumping for joy.\n\n\nAs another example, White Palace, a movie to be released under this\nnew rating, is about a young man who gets involved with a seedy waitress\nalmost 20 years his senior.\n\n\nNeither of them boast a strong story-line nor critical acclaim.\n\n\nIf one of the main objections opponents of R-rated movies have is\nnot just the nudity but the so-called compromising of values that these\nmovies reflect, then this R(A) system is not going to make much difference.\n\n\nQuality, ultimately, is still subjective.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that a lot of trash has been coming in since the\nGovernment began to allow R-rated movies.\n\n\nBut some figures show that attendance at such movies has been\nfalling of late, and cinema operators have shown signs of screening more\npopular movies that do not require a minimum age limit.\n\n\nWhile it is good that the Government has shown that it does listen\nto the views of the people, it must be said at the same time that things\nshould not be done in half measures.\n\n\nConsidering that the classification of movies came about after\nyears of thought, to amend it with an R(A) system is almost tantamount to\ngoing back to the old days, for the element of choice is no longer there.\n\n\nRaising the minimum age from 18 to 21 was sufficient.\n\n\nTo go one step further and decree what is or is not artistic for\nadults will not just go down poorly, it will be an incredibly difficult, if\nnot impossible, thing to do.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b9a12f45-6f59-4643-9ab7-1c54178ca731', 'added':

at home.\n\n\nIf they are, there is no knowing where the Soviet Union will be\nheaded and what its demands of the International order will be.\n\n\nMoscow\'s international friends can do only so much; the real impetus\nfor reform must come from within.\n\n\nWhile it takes time to turn around countries as large and complex as\nthe Soviet Union, the frightening truth is that Mr Gorbachev does not have\nmuch time.  \n\n\n\n  Time to let go  \n\n\n A BOOK aptly entitled Soviet Disunion, published this year, sketches four\npossible scenarios for the Soviet Union in the l990s.\n\n\nThe first is the gradual disintegration of the empire; the second,\nthe creation of a Soviet Commonwealth; the third, a genuinely federal\ncountry; and the fourth, the restoration of Imperial authoritarianism.\n\n\nThe authors, Messrs Bohdan Nahaylo and Victor Swoboda,\nsay that these are scenarios for the l990s.\n\n\nAll indications are, however, that a stark choice may have to be made\nas early as next year.\n\n\nThere is an overwhelming consensus in the constituent republics that\nthe Soviet Union cannot continue in its present form.\n\n\nThe only real questions are whether the Kremlin will allow peaceful\nchange, or whether the country will tear apart, or whether reactionary\nelements in the military, the KGB and the Communist Party will try to\nreassert central authority.\n\n\nThe last possibility is very real, but not only is it questionable\nwhether force will be sufficient to quell nationalist discontent, it is also\ncertain that the West\'s attitude to the Soviet Union will change dramatically\nif the bayonet is used to keep the empire together.\n\n\nIt is to be hoped that Soviet dependence on Western food and other\naid will cause the reactionaries to think three times before taking any\nprecipitate action. \n\n\n Since nationalist feelings will not go away, the only feasible solution\nis one that sees a real devolution of economic and political powers to the\nrepublics, which will effectively become nations that can decide how to\nregulate their relations with one another.\n\n\nAdmittedly, this is not going to be easy.\n\n\nA reformulation of the federal structure that involves multiple\ntransfers of population will affect the substantial numbers of Russians\nliving in the non-Russian republics and   vice versa \n , a relocation made doubly difficult by the country\'s parlous\nfinancial situation.\n\n\nThen, there is a high level of integration in the Soviet economy,\nmade up of a series of intermeshing links between factories and firms\nacross the country.\n\n\nThese links, in matters such as the supply of raw materials at often\nartificially low prices determined by Moscow, might be costly for some\nrepublics to snap.\n\n\nThe counter-argument is that the republics will be free to set up new\ntrade regimes determined by market forces.\n\n\nIndeed, they are doing this to a certain extent even now, and since\nmany of these republics simply refuse to accept economic directions\nfrom the Kremlin or co-ordinate their economic policies anyway, it is\nbest to legitimise what is   de facto   and\nmake it   de jure   . \n\n\n Doing so involves an act of will.\n\n\nThe problem is that there is a lack of meeting ground between the\nKremlin and the republics.\n\n\nPresident Mikhail Gorbachev has always accepted the Soviet\nstructure as a given and thus is too parsimonious in the autonomy he is\nwilling to allow the republics.\n\n\nLeaders of the republics, on their part, are making extreme,\nand indeed often unrealistic, demands of Moscow in a bid to preserve\npopular support back home.\n\n\nThe gulf is dramatised by the repeated rejection of Mr Gorbachev\'s\nconstitutional offers by the republics, which are set on\nimmediate and unconditional independence.\n\n\nThe problem is compounded by bad blood between the Kremlin,\nwhich sees itself as the preserver of Soviet unity, and the rich and powerful\nRussian Federation, which sees itself as the greatest economic,\npolitical and cultural beneficiary of sucession from the Soviet Union.\n\n\nThere is tier upon tier of disunity. \n\n\n It is time wiser counsel prevailed, and all sides got together, not to\naccost each other as enemies but as partners who have the delicate, but by no\nmeans impossible, job of devising a new constitutional framework for\nthe Soviet Union.\n\n\nLetting the Baltic states leave might be the first step towards the\ncreation of a Soviet Commonwealth that can combine self-government with the\nretention of necessary economic links.\n\n\nMr Gorbachev owes his country a peaceful devolution of the Kremlin\'s\npowers.\n\n\nHe does not have very much time in which to do it.  \n\n\n\n  Last stand in Moscow  \n\n\n LOOKING back at all the signals coming out of Moscow in recent months,\nthe only surprise about the coup against Mr Mikhail Gorbachev is that anyone\nshould have been surprised at all.\n\n\nEver since former Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze warned\nlast December that the country was heading towards a dictatorship, hardline\nopponents of Mr Gorbachev have been calling for his ouster.\n\n\nIn April, the rightwing Soyuz group in the Soviet parliament\ncirculated a petition among members demanding a special session at which he\nwas to be called to account and removed.\n\n\nIn June, hardliners within the government briefly attempted a\nconstitutional coup and sought unsuccessfully to transfer many of his powers\nto Mr Valentin Pavlov, the conservative Prime Minister.\n\n\nA month later, a group of 12 hardliners accused reformers of leading\nthe country to ruin and called on the military to step in.\n\n\nThe military\'s response was a statement on Friday in the Armed Forces\ndaily, Krasnaya Zvezda, asserting that the Communist Party and armed forces\nwere under open assault from anti-communist forces and appealing to\nparty members to close ranks in defence of the  socialist\nFatherland  . \n\n\n The hardliners\' anger against Mr Gorbachev is not wholly unjustified.\n\n\nWhile the world might see him as the visionary who ended the\ndebilitating Cold War and as the gallant reformer trying to drag his country\ninto the modern era of growth and democracy, to them, he is the man whose\npolicies were destroying thc empire bequeathed to them by the Russian tsars\nand which the Communist Party had turned into a superpower.\n\n\nIn the manner of coup-makers everywhere, the hardliners have\nexaggerated the disorder in the Soviet Union to justify their move - but not\nby much: The country was gripped by chaos and anarchy and, in the words of\nthe so-called state-of-emergency committee, had become ungovernable.\n\n\nThe problem is that the committee is unlikely to be able to do any\nbetter than Mr Gorbachev and may, in fact, provoke far greater disorder and\nbloodshed than the country has seen so far. \n\n\n Throughout the country\'s long-running crisis, the hardliners have not\nproduced a single constructive proposal to rescue it from its most\nbasic problem - an economy that is in terminal decline.\n\n\nTheir only platform has been that law-and-order must be restored, and\nthis is what they pledge to do now.\n\n\nThe question is: how?\n\n\nAlthough they command awesome powers on paper, they do not have\ntroops enough to quell the entire country should the republican and local\ngovernments and the millions who voted them into office - in their parlance,\nthe  extremist forces  - refuse to submit to their\norders.\n\n\nIndeed, it is not at all certain that the troops that they do have\nwould do their bidding.\n\n\nThey may, when it comes to the crunch, simply fade away.\n\n\nAnd even assuming the best-case scenario for the coup-makers, the one\nclear lesson of recent decades is that the command system simply does not\nwork; the economy cannot be commanded to produce. \n\n\n There was tacit recognition of this in the first address by the new\nregime\'s acting President, Mr Gennady Yanayev, when he stated that the\nemergency measures were only temporary and  in no way mean\nrenunciation of the course towards profound reforms in all spheres of life of\nthe state and society  .\n\n\nBut reform, in today\'s Soviet context, necessarily means\naltering the power balance between the centre and the republics, and\nthat is precisely the point the hardliners refuse to concede.\n\n\nBy removing Mr Gorbachev when they did, the hardliners prevented his\nsigning the new union treaty devolving key powers to the republics.\n\n\nUltimately, however, they will have to take the same route if they\nare to have any chance of success at all in their proclaimed task of saving\nthe country.\n\n\nWithout the free consent of the republics, and their peoples,\nthe enterprise is doomed to fail.  \n\n\n\n  Averting a bloody split  \n\n\n WHEN the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia 74 years ago, they promised\nthe non-Russian peoples of the vast tsarist empire self-determination - and\nwound up controlling them more tightly than the Tsars had done.\n\n\nTen days ago, their bumbling heirs launched an abortive coup to try\nand save the empire - and dealt it its   coup de grace \n .\n\n\nThe Soviet Union is not just, as President Mikhail Gorbachev put it,\n a different country  from the one it was before the coup\nattempt.\n\n\nAs things look now, the Soviet Union effectively no longer exists as\na political entity.\n\n\nThe institutions and apparatus of state power remain - and are\nbeing swiftly absorbed one after another by the Russian republic under\nPresident Boris Yeltsin.\n\n\nThey are also becoming more irrelevant by the day as the\ncentrifugal passions unleashed by the coup and its aftermath spread to republics\nonce only remarkable for their fealty to - and dependence on - the\nunion. \n\n\n Some other form of association will be devised to take its place, if only\nbecause economically, the republics are highly dependent on one another and\nespecially on Russia.\n\n\nIt is the only one of the 15 to be near economic self-sufficiency.\n\n\nIt subsidises the others to the tune of some 70 billion roubles\na year, equivalent to about 7 per cent of the Soviet GNP.\n\n\nMore important, all the republics are bound by a system that\ncommanded that just one or two factories would supply the entire Soviet\neconomy with a particular product.\n\n\nTheoretically, that need not be an insurmountable barrier; what\nthe republics can no longer get from former partners, they can always import\nfrom elsewhere.\n\n\nIn practice, that option does not exist for the republics, none\nhaving the hard currency to pay for its needs or sufficiently attractive\ngoods to trade for them.\n\n\nIt is this realisation that lies behind yesterday\'s agreement between\nMr Gorbachev and the presidents of the Russia, Kazakhstan and Kirghizia\nto draw up an agreement on economic cooperation to be open to all 15\nrepublics. \n\n\n But even assuming the best, that all or the majority of the 15 will sign\non, the economic agreement is no substitute for the union treaty that was to\nhave been signed the day after the coup but which has now been rejected as no\nlonger acceptable, even by those who were its strongest proponents. \n\n\nThe search is now on for an alternative pact, but whether a formula\ncan be found to satisfy all the key republics is doubtful.\n\n\nPresident Yeltsin and his aides, by their words and actions during\nand after the coup, have made clear that Russia sees itself as the big\nbrother of the new union.\n\n\nBut at least two of the republics reject that claim, namely Ukraine,\nthe second-richest and most populous after Russia, and\nKazakhstan, the second-largest, which responded to Russian threats that it\nmight want to review its frontiers with republics seceding without its\nagreement by issuing its own warning, that war could break out if that\nhappened. \n\n\n It is probably a little premature to say that the Soviet Union will go\nthe way of Yugoslavia.\n\n\nBut the potential for that happening is enormous.\n\n\nOf the 23 inter-republican borders, only three are not contested.\n\n\nNearly as many Russians ( 60 million) live outside the Russian\nrepublic as inside it ( 82 million) and virtually every republic has\nsignificant minorities which want their own independence from the\nmajority population there.\n\n\nNot surprisingly for a state spanning 10 time zones, Russia itself\nis the prime example, having within its borders 31 " autonomous" republics,\nregions and areas - containing some of its most important factories,\nand raw materials.\n\n\nAlready creaky before the coup attempt, when there was still some\nsemblance of central authority that the key republics acknowledged at least\nnominally, the entire Soviet edifice could collapse, and very bloodily, if Mr\nYeltsin and other republican leaders do not proceed with great\nrestraint and care in the days and weeks ahead.\n\n\nThat crack-up, unlike Yugoslavia\'s, will not be easy for the world\nto ignore.', 'subdomain':

{'text': 'Wealth sharing S\'pore-style  \n\n\n FOR those who believe that massive give-aways are a panacea for the poor,\na sobering reminder is to be found in Finance Minister Richard Hu\'s keynote\naddress at an economics conference on income distribution held here last\nweek.\n\n\nHe said Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union which at tempted\ntotal elimination of income inequalities have ended up in economic atrophy\nand social disorder.\n\n\nSince all countries could profit from each other\'s experience in the\ncomplex subject of income distribution, Dr Hu recounted how Singapore\nsucceeded in tackling the problem by empha sising equality of\nopportunity and equity of re ward, rather than equality of income. \n\n\n With little land and other resources, Singapore was constrained from\nredistribution via direct progressive taxation or generous subsidies.\n\n\nAlso, at the beginning there was little to redistribute as mass\nunemployment, crowded and unsanitary housing and low per capita income were\nthe order of the day.\n\n\nThe only thing that the Government could give away was a conducive\nframework for job creation.\n\n\nThis it did by structuring a pro-business strategy that\nattracted investors.\n\n\nThe jobs rolled in.\n\n\nWhere others sought to tackle inequali ties with hand-outs,\nSingapore did with jobs.\n\n\nEqually important in this strategy is the practice of meritocracy\nwhich greatly fostered upward mobility and has bscome a powerful spur to\neconomic endeavour and new enterprise, underlining that equity of reward\nnot only effectively redis tributes income but ensures that the momentum\nfor job creation and, therefore, growth continues. \n\n\n While Singapore\'s strategy did not provide for consumption subsidies, it\ndoes allow help in asset accumulation.\n\n\nLow-cost housing, provided some times through acquisition of\nland from private owners at below market price, enabled a major\nredistribution of assets.\n\n\nThe scheduled upgrading of HDB housing where the Government will pay\n&dollar;2 for every\n&dollar;1 put in by the owner will redistribute wealth further.\n\n\nThe redistribution does not stop at mortar and bricks.\n\n\nBy continuing to invest heavi ly in education, in and outside of\nthe workplace, everyone is given a chance to accumulate human capital through\nthe acquisition of new skills.\n\n\nWith this " human capital", workers will be better able to negotiate\na more equitable share of an enter prise\'s income with the providers of\ntraditional capital.\n\n\nThis again redistributes wealth, but not without effort on the part\nof those receiving it.\n\n\nBut then this is what equity of reward is about.\n\n\nYou get equal opportunity to acquire the capital.\n\n\nYou invest it.\n\n\nYou get rewards commensurate with the value of your capital.\n\n\nThe integrity of capital, which makes savings meaningful, has been\nmaintained by a low inflation regime. \n\n\n Now if Singapore\'s approach to redressing in equalities is a bit\nhard-headed, it nevertheless is not heartless.\n\n\nFor although the emphasis remains  from each his contribution\nand to each his own reward  , it recognises that there will always be\nsome - like the aged poor and otherwise under privileged - who will need\nhelp.\n\n\nEconomic suc cess may reduce demand for Government-subsi\ndised basic health care and education but such facilities will remain easily\navailable to those in need.\n\n\nHowever, reflecting the ethos of self-help in the system, the\nGovernment expects private con tributions for the care of the\nunder-class, just as it expects cost sharing from those who want the\nGovernment to gild the lily by way of art and culture.\n\n\nAs First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said at the reopening of\nthe National Museum last week when the question of Govern ment aid for\nmuseums was raised: the Govern ment\'s priority would always be to\nsatisfy the people\'s material aspirations. \n\n\n This then is Singapore\'s experience in wealth sharing.\n\n\nThe formula may not work for everyone but because it has worked well\nfor Singapore, there must be something in it of benefit to coun tries\nwhich choose to emulate what has been done here through selective adaptation.\n \n\n\n\n  Poorer without Gatt  \n\n\n FOR all the dire warnings of the catastrophe that would follow a collapse\nof the current trade talks going on in Brussels, it may be assumed that the\nworld will still go on.\n\n\nAs some experts have noted, it is not politicians and governments\nthat trade but private businesses.\n\n\nAnd, increasingly, they are making cross-border investments and\nforging multilateral co-operative ties that will boost inter national\ntrade whatever politicians decide.\n\n\nNever theless, governments can make things easier or more\ndifficult for businesses.\n\n\nAnd there can be little doubt that it would be a poorer world if this\nweek\'s talks, the culmination of four years of intensive negotiations, end in\nfailure.\n\n\nThe benefits of free trade are obvious.\n\n\nThe establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (\nGatt) in 1947 and the reductions in tariffs achieved under its auspices have\ngreatly stimulated world trade and brought prosperity to the countries that\nhave abided by its rules. \n\n\n The latest round of talks, the most ambitious ever will determine how\nnations deal and co-oper ate with each other in a world that is no\nlonger divided by the Cold War and in which economic strength will\nincreasingly matter more than guns and missiles.\n\n\nWithout new agreement on a clear set of trade rules, the bickering\nand threats and counter-threats among the major trading nations in recent\nyears can only grow worse.\n\n\nDeveloping countries like Singapore that have been able to grow under\nGatt could flounder without continu ing access to the rich Western\nmarkets.\n\n\nThe poor er nations, in particular the debt-ridden Africans and\nLatin Americans and the East Europeans now struggling towards a market\neconomy, stand to suffer most if the talks fail.\n\n\nWithout access to Western markets, they cannot hope to succeed and\nwill only slide further into debt and poverty. \n\n\n The social disorders that must inevitably follow threaten not only them\nbut the rich nations as well.\n\n\nAt the very least, there will be even more people than ever from the\npoor countries making their way to the rich lands for jobs and opportunities.\n\n\nAs before, the rich countries will no doubt try to ward off the worst\nand along the way salve their conscience by providing financial assistance.\n\n\nBut the continuing, in some cases worsening, pov erty among many\naid recipients shows the limita tions of handouts.\n\n\nGenerosity in admitting their exports works far better.\n\n\nAccording to a recent World Bank study, developing countries would\ngain twice as much as they receive in foreign aid if the rich nations would\nremove their barriers on agriculture alone.\n\n\nConsumers in the rich nations would benefit greatly too.\n\n\nAccording to OECD estimates, it is costing them some US&dollar;147 billion a\nyear to protect their relatively few but well-off farmers against imports.\n\n\n\n Rationally then, all arguments are in favour of freer trade in\nagriculture.\n\n\nIronically, however, it is disagreement on this very issue that\nthreatens the whole liberalisation package.\n\n\nThe United States and its allies in the so-called Cairns group of\nfarm exporters, which include four Asean na tions, have warned that they\nwill walk away from the talks unless the European Community agrees to deep\ncuts in its agricultural price supports, subsidies and market barriers.\n\n\nThere is disagree ment too on a multitude of other issues,\nincluding the extension of Gatt rules to cover the fast-growing trade\nin services, two-fifths of which happens to be accounted for by the EC.\n\n\nHere, it is the US, which demanded the extension in the first place,\nwhich is acting as villain.\n\n\nIt now wants to exclude certain key sectors such as aviation,\nshipping and telecommunications from Gatt rules.\n\n\nThe EC, not surprisingly, has hit out at the Americans for this, but\nthe blame game does no one any good.\n\n\nWith out major concessions by all the key parties, and very\nquickly too, there will not merely be no new trade order to look forward to.\n\n\nThere may be no order at all; and the result could be trade dis\nputes that would make today\'s squabbling look like a tea party.  \n\n\n\n  When wealth gets in the way  \n\n\n A REFRIGERATOR, a washing machine and a video cassette recorder.\n\n\nDo these add up to being comfortably off?\n\n\nIf so, it appears that the majori ty of Singaporeans have indeed\narrived.\n\n\nAccord ing to figures released by Deputy Prime Minister Lee\nHsien Loong in Parliament on Monday, more than 70 per cent of Singapore\nhouseholds possess these consumer durables, owned by less than half of\nhouseholds 20 years ago.\n\n\nHe gave other figures too, all of them indicative of the dramatic\nprog ress that Singaporeans in all income groups have made.\n\n\nTogether, they are an effective counter point to remarks made\nduring a recent seminar by university don Tan Kong Yam that an impor\ntant segment of the population, the 20 per cent or so who may be\ncharacterised as the upper-middle class, is caught in a " middle class\nsqueeze". \n\n\n Dr Tan, vice-dean of the business administra tion faculty of the\nNational University of Singa pore, maintained that the top 10 per cent\nof in come earners had no grouses as their incomes were pegged to\ndeveloped country rates and could afford anything they wanted.\n\n\nThe lower 70 per cent were content to enjoy the benefits of heavy\ngovernment subsidies, in housing, health care and public transport.\n\n\nA happy political alliance be tween the " HDB heartland" class\nand the 10 percent elite ensured that the durability of this sys tem\ncontinues, Dr Tan surmised.\n\n\nBut, he went on, there was also the upper middle class who were not\nso happy: They aspired to something more than public housing and public\ntransport but were thwarted from attaining this by the superior pur\nchasing power of the top 10 per cent.\n\n\nIt was these people who were most likely to vote with their feet, Dr\nTan said. \n\n\n Brigadier-General ( Res) Lee\'s figures, and the comments he made on the\nsubject, are a reminder that, whatever the merits of Dr Tan\'s theory, it is\nridiculous to think of the upper middle class in Singapore as a deprived\ngroup.\n\n\nAs BG Lee noted, even millionaires could use Singapore\'s subsidised\nservices if they chose, except for public housing - which is open to 95 per\ncent of the population.\n\n\nAnd while some of those eligible might feel HDB flats beneath them,\nmany supposedly well-to-do for eigners, the Japanese in particular,\nwould only be too happy if they could have anything as good, and on the terms\nSingaporeans acquire them.\n\n\nSo if there is a middle class squeeze, it is not ground ed on\nfact but on expectations and perception.\n\n\nAnd therein lies the problem.\n\n\nIt is probably no where near as large as Dr Tan made out.\n\n\nIndica tions are that many Singaporeans, especially the young,\nno longer see the good life in terms solely of such things as ownership of\nprivate property, fancy cars or membership in country clubs.\n\n\nIn creasingly, they measure their well-being and sta tus by\nacquiring art work, designer clothes, for eign holidays or dining well -\nand are well able to indulge these. \n\n\n However, there can be little doubt that there are also many Singaporeans\nwho do hanker after big cars, a house with a garden and more.\n\n\nAnd for all that their incomes have risen year after year, along with\neveryone else\'s, the prices of their dream acquisitions have risen much\nfaster and are thus out of reach.\n\n\nHuman beings being what they are, it probably does no good - to point\nout that this is inevitable given Singapore\'s limited size, or to remind them\nthat they are far better off than their counterparts in Japan, or even the\nUnited States where real incomes have stagnated for two decades and\nuniversity graduates with working wives find that they cannot afford the same\nhouses their blue-collar parents had.\n\n\nHow many would actually be driven to emigrate is debatable.\n\n\nBut the mismatch between their expec tations and their ability\nto meet them is some thing that requires government attention.\n\n\nTo dis miss it out of hand would be to feed their unhappiness\nand discontent.  \n\n\n\n  Growth Advocate  \n\n\n Each rung up the economic ladder from develop ing country to newly\nindustrialising economy and onward to developed nation becomes increasingly\ndifficult to attain.\n\n\nIt is not only that the scale of economic activities is larger, the\nnature of the operations more complex andco-ordination of de\ncisionmaking among various parties more intri cate. \n\n\nThe unity of purpose among the population in according the same\npriority to economic growth also becomes harder to hold together.\n\n\nAs Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted last Thursday at the\nEconomic Development Board\'s 30th anniversary dinner, the circum stances\nin Singapore are no longer as desperate as in the Sixties when the threat of\na 100,000-strong army of unemployed was breathing the urgency of growth down\neverybody\'s neck.\n\n\nThere is now more room, and sometimes temptation, to argue for\npolicies on non-economic grounds, even if it means trading off some growth.\n\n\n\n This " we have arrived" syndrome that accompanies economic success is not\nentirely bad.\n\n\nIt makes the country kinder and gentler; more\nenvironmentally-conscious, and more supportive of the arts.\n\n\nBut as Brigadier-General ( Res) Lee stressed, the decisions to\ntrade off economic growth for other social objectives should be made with the\nfull understanding and acceptance of the implications, and not in the vague\nhope that no cost is involved.\n\n\nTo tot up the costs and keep them at the forefront of everybody\'s\nmind, an unswerving advocate of economic growth is needed.\n\n\nSo far, the EDB has played the role of growth advocate to the hilt,\npushing hard to get the entire population to go for growth and helping the\nGovernment to focus all its policies on promoting growth.\n\n\nAs Dr Goh Keng Swee said, without the EDB, some foreign investors\nwould still have come here.\n\n\nBut many more would not even have considered Singapore, or been\naware of what it had to offer. \n\n\n The EDB is a perfect counterpoise to the advocates of other social\nobjectives.\n\n\nThrough its network of overseas offices, it has its pulse on what\nthe foreign investors really need and what windows of opportunity are being\nmissed if the pursuit of other social objectives were to pull the shutters\ndown.\n\n\nAttaining developed country status will be put out of Singapore\'s\nreach if even the EDB succumbs to the blandishments to take it easy on\neconomic growth, for the sake of other social objectives.\n\n\nThat is when everyone starts to kid himself that there is no cost\ninvolved.\n\n\nThere will also be no more Texas instrument-like investments taking\noff within 50 days, however efficient the civil service continues to be.\n\n\nThe bedrock of Singapore society is continued economic success.\n\n\nWithout that, it cannot pay for gracious living or a cleaner\nenvironment.\n\n\nThe most important lesson the EDB should draw from its past 30\nyears of contributions to Singapore\'s economic success is that it must be\nsteadfast in making the case for the highest sustainable economic growth to\nthe Government, even if on occasion it might find itself a lone voice crying\nin the wilderness for growth. \n\n\n The EDB must preserve the boldness of its dreams and its role as the\nGovernment\'s leading entrepreneur.\n\n\nThree new areas of focus have been outlined by BG Lee for the\nboard.\n\n\nOne is to promote depth and breadth in those industries that are\nniches for Singapore, such as the Winchester disk drive industry.\n\n\nAnother is for the EDB to go international, building on its\noperational headquarters programme, its international direct investment\nprogramme and the Growth Triangle project.\n\n\nThe third focus is on contributing to Singapore\'s manpower\ndevelopment by building up the existing EDB training centres and institutes\ninto centres of excellence for core skills, and by tapping the board\'s\nwell-established international network to attract overseas talent.\n\n\nHow to keep these new economic objectives

{'text': "SES: More teeth and openness  \n\n\n FINANCE Minister Richard Hu last Friday cleared the air over several\nissues thrown up by the problems at United Industrial Corporation which had\nled to much unhealthy speculation about insider trading and debate on fitting\npunishments for companies which do not live up to their disclosure\nobligations.\n\n\nSpeaking in Parliament, he gave Singaporeans a lesson on what\nconstitutes an insider trading offence, reiterating a point he had made\nearlier in a letter to Nominated MP Maurice Choo.\n\n\nThere is no evidence of insider trading against UlC's former\ncontrolling shareholder, Mr Oei Hong Leong, and the executive chairman, Mr\nLee Kim Yew.\n\n\nThe laws here turn on whether the parties to a transaction have equal\ninformation about the deal.\n\n\nIndonesian tycoon Liem Sioe Liong knew about UlC's losses before he\nbought the shares.\n\n\nNeither buyer nor seller were disadvantaged, and insider trading\nallegations could not be sustained.\n\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore regularly evaluates many possible\nviolations of the Securities Industrial Act and where there is \n prima facie   evidence of wrong-doing they are sent to\nthe Attorney General or the Commercial Affairs Department for\ninvestigation and prosecution.\n\n\nThe facts of UIC's case show that no insider trading offence under the\nAct was committed. \n\n\n However, on whether public censure is enough for companies which do not\nhonour their undertakings to the Stock Exchange of Singapore, Dr Hu\nconceded that the SES might need tougher sanctions.\n\n\nCurrently, besides censure - seen by many as a mere tap on the wrist\n- it could suspend a company's shares or delist them.\n\n\nBut as the Minister pointed out, these are extreme measures and are\nlikely to hurt ordinary shareholders more than those responsible for a\ncompany's misconduct.\n\n\nThe two extremes of penalties now available must reduce both the SES'\nflexibility and subtlety when dealing with recalcitrants.\n\n\nSince Parliament has given it the encouragement, the exchange should\nseize the opportunity to review what weapons would be more responsive\nto situations arising from an increasingly sophisticated market.\n\n\nTo discharge its regulatory responsibilities better, it might\nhave to acquire equipment for precision bombing, which in the corporate\nworld could mean removal of the board, denial of market access or forbidding\ntrading in the shares owned by the culprits for a specific period.\n\n\nThe pain would then hit closer to home. \n\n\n Apart from a lack of suitable weapons to punish those who disobey, the\nSES has been shown by the UIC affair to lack also the sort of openness that\nis increasingly demanded in today's more open and consultative climate.\n\n\nComplaints centre especially on its rejection of rights or bonus\nissues without explanation.\n\n\nThis cannot last and Dr Hu has advised a change of heart.\n\n\nThe SES appears ready to do this, although it still wants to reserve\nthe right not to explain, in exceptional circumstances. \n\n\n For the sake of its credibility, the exchange should make those\ncircumstances extremely rare.\n\n\nThe market will allow the SES the discretion of silence only if it is\nconvinced that when the regulators keep quiet, it is genuinely in the\npublic interest - not because they are unable to justify their actions by\nreference to the rule-book.\n\n\nThe SES must accept that a well-regulated market is one where not\nonly are its rules obeyed, but one where the rules are also well-known.\n\n\nIts view is that they already are.\n\n\nEven so, more good than harm will come from reiterating them at every\nopportunity, since every exposition will reduce the number of those who can\nclaim ignorance in defence should they offend.\n\n\nAs for those clamouring to know why they do not meet the exchange's\nexacting standards, they must not turn squeamish if the SES tells all.\n\n\nThose who ask for more openness must expect that some candid truths\nhurt and not necessarily those who tell them.\n\n\nThe SES has been primed for more openness and tougher action.\n\n\nHopefully the market is ready for them.  \n\n\n\n  Banking on ethics  \n\n\n IS SINGAPORE'S financial sector over-regulated or could it do with having\nmore loopholes plugged to remove any residual temptation there might be for\nthe cavalier-minded?\n\n\nHow this question is handled depends on whether the response is from\nthose at the receiving end or from the side dishing it out.\n\n\nWhatever the answer is, there is no denying the benefits that have\naccrued to Singapore as a result of a regulatory framework that does not\ncompromise on sound prudent standards.\n\n\nConsequently, the country is able to boast of never having\nsuffered one single bank failure since independence - a remarkable\nrecord, considering the number of bank collapses that many developing and\ndeveloped countries have had to endure in the past 25 years.\n\n\nAnd despite the volatility and excesses that accompanied the\nglobal move to deregulate the international financial system,\nSingapore not only managed to come through the past decade unscathed but also\nenjoyed the underpinning of a financial sector that grew at twice the\nrate of what was already a high growth economy. \n\n\n However, while a comprehensive set of laws may keep the sector strong and\nthe crooked sidelined, it may not be fine-honed enough to deal with\nthose who abide by the letter but blatantly snub the spirit of the rules.\n\n\nThat there are people of such malleable ethics is reflected in the\nalarming jump in the number of written complaints which the Monetary\nAuthority of Singapore has received against financial institutions.\n\n\nIn the first 5 1/2 months of this year, the number was just three\nshort of the total for the whole of last year.\n\n\nMost are venal, not criminal.\n\n\nBut rather than wait for the situation to deteriorate and discipline\nto be imposed externally, the Association of Banks in Singapore has seized\nthe initiative - probably with the MAS' encouragement - to enforce order.\n\n\nA code of conduct that seeks to define the parameters of fair\nbank-customer relationship and ethical standards of conduct for bank\nstaff has been drawn up for consideration by the newly-elected council of the\nABS which meets tomorrow.\n\n\nWhile no penalties for breaching the code will be laid down, the ABS\nlooks to exerting moral pressure to bring member banks into line. \n\n\n The ABS move is a welcome change from the blinkered approach of the\nsecurities industry back in the 1980s when it steadfastly refused either to\nrecognise the dangers posed by its shortcomings or to reform, despite much\nprompting from the authorities.\n\n\nWhat followed belongs to the annals of Singapore's financial sector.\n\n\nThe unethical - and illegal - excesses culminated in the Pan Electric\nIndustries debacle, which forced the regulators to step in to restore order,\ntaking away much of the industry's self-regulating independence. \n\n\n Hopefully, the bankers' move to put their house in order heralds a new\nera where businesses will want increasingly to be responsible for policing\ntheir own activities and delineating what is, and what is not, the acceptable\nface of capitalism.\n\n\nHowever, for such self-regulation to work, business leaders\nwill need to have high moral authority.\n\n\nThat they can achieve only if they demand an impeccable standard of\nethics of themselves and refuse to tolerate anything less from their peers.\n\n\nBut when the Stock Exchange of Singapore had to intervene even in\nissues where the expected conduct is quite obvious - for instance, the SES\nhad to stop some major shareholders from allotting themselves giant portions\nof shares at preferential prices in executive stock option schemes - the time\nmay not be ripe yet for regulators to undo their gloves and look on the\nprivate sector as partners.\n\n\nThey can relax only when Singapore's financial community proves\nitself beyond doubt to have ethics that can be banked on.\n\n\nAny premature relaxation could court the massive business\nfailures and frauds which huge countries can shrug off with little dent to\ntheir credibility but not tiny Singapore which relies on its vaunted\nintegrity to keep the investors coming in, especially the foreign ones.\n \n\n\n\n  Invaluable lessons  \n\n\n IF anyone here thought it was through sheer good luck that the collapsed\nBank of Credit and Commerce International had no operations in\nSingapore, he was not allowed to retain that illusion for long.\n\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore issued a statement last weekend\nrevealing that BCCI had in fact made not one but three formal applications\nover a 10-year span between 1973 and 1982 for a licence to operate here.\n\n\nAfter that, it also met MAS officials on several occasions to plead\nits case, but to no avail.\n\n\nThe bank, like the defunct National Bank of Brunei, could not meet\nMAS' admission criteria and Singapore once again avoided the kind of\ndisruption to its banking system now causing severe problems to 69\ncountries where the failed BCCI had operations. \n\n\n There are invaluable lessons from this episode, one of which is the\ncrucial role played by vigilant regulators who are not dazzled or intimidated\nby well-known names or high-powered connections when it comes to deciding who\nshould be allowed to do business in a country.\n\n\nUntil convicted and fined for drug-money laundering in the United\nStates last year, BCCI appeared to have impressive enough credentials,\nincluding the ruler of Abu Dhabi as its 77 per cent owner.\n\n\nConsidering oil money's power of persuasion in the early 1970s when\nmost countries jockeyed for a share in recycling petrodollars, MAS'\nrefusal reflected both stringency and street-smartness of a kind not always\nevident in banking regulators.\n\n\nIt also showed a keen appreciation of the whispers circulating\nfor years about that bank on the international financial grapevine,\nalthough hard proof was not found until late last month when the Bank of\nEngland got the whole sorry story from BCCI's auditors.\n\n\nLosses had been systematically concealed for many years by\nusing virtually every accounting trick in the book.\n\n\nThe lesson from this is that there are times when regulators may have\nto act on well-founded suspicion alone, for by the time the dirty linen is\nuncovered, it may well be too late.\n\n\nCritics are now arguing that regulators in countries where BCCI had\noperations should have acted far sooner instead of waiting for proof. \n\n\n After the event, it is easy to see the sandy foundation on which the BCCI\nempire was built.\n\n\nIts main operations were based in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands,\ntwo financial centres with no central bank and only limited regulatory\ncapacity.\n\n\nIt also meant that BCCI had no lender of last resort other than its\nArab controlling shareholder.\n\n\nHowever, if protection of innocent depositors is to have any meaning,\nthe important thing is for guardians to grasp the implications before the\ndenouement, not after.\n\n\nThe worst dereliction is when regulators hesitate to act for\nfear of precipitating a collapse.\n\n\nThis seems to have been what happened in Hongkong.\n\n\nAfter Britain and other countries had acted against BCCI,\nregulators in the colony continued to make soothing noises, only to do an\nabout-turn a few days later. \n\n\n One further lesson from BCCI is the danger countries court by allowing\nforeign bank branches to proliferate within their frontiers, when they do not\nhave the means or the jurisdiction to follow such banks' activities globally.\n\n\nThe 120,000 small individual depositors in Britain who lost their\nmoney through BCCI's 25 branches are learning to their cost the danger of\nbanking with a foreign bank.\n\n\nHowever, the political cost to the ruling Conservative Party could be\nfar higher, as depositors will blame their government - which gave BCCI\na licence - for their loss, rather than their greed for high-yielding\nfacilities.\n\n\nTo be sure, even an offshore branch fraudulently managed could do\nmuch harm but certainly much less than if a whole network were allowed to\noperate on par with domestic banks.\n\n\nThe point is that regulators are not there to guarantee against bank\nfailures but to provide a system of checks to make them highly unlikely, and\nto limit the damage if the unlikely should happen.\n\n\nThat is what MAS has been doing.  \n\n\n\n  Self-rule needs high integrity  \n\n\n IS A Code of Conduct, now being studied by members of the Association of\nBanks in Singapore, necessary for banks operating here? \n\n\nIt will come on top of the Banking Act, the Securities Industry Act\nand the Companies Act besides the various rules and regulations imposed by\nthe Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Stock Exchange of Singapore on\nlisted companies and stockbroking firms.\n\n\nLocal banks are already listed directly or indirectly on the SES,\nwhile those with stockbroking arms have further to knuckle down to SES and\nMAS discipline like any member firm.\n\n\nThe existence of such multi-layered and multi-pronged supervision\ntogether with various laws suggest that there are already enough safeguards\nto cover any conceivable loophole for banks and their staff to misbehave.\n\n\nIt adds up to a persuasive case against having any more rules,\nespecially in light of the present climate where they are perceived as\nstifling creative flair or entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n\nYet like most persuasive arguments, it is speciously flawed. \n\n\n The existence of laws has not put the courts or jails out of business.\n\n\nAnd the existence of comprehensive companies and securities\nlegislation and formal guidelines may not keep the financial system\nconsistently scandal-free either, if there is no strong commitment to\nfostering increasingly higher standards of professionalism and integrity\namong practitioners in the industry.\n\n\nThe draft code will bring what are in the statute books right into\nthe dealing room or the banking hall by putting together a set of do's and\ndon'ts for bank officers, from abuse of position, to misuse of information\nand conflict of interests.\n\n\nSuch a code is particularly useful here where foreign banks owing no\nallegiance, for example, to the SES which provides one of the many safeguards\n- dominate the industry.\n\n\nTheir cultures and values may not always be consonant with the high\nstandards insisted upon here and the code would serve as a constant reminder\nto them of this. \n\n\n The trouble with the ABS code, however, is that it lacks the power of\nsanction.\n\n\nWhile it can preach and teach, it cannot impeach.\n\n\nIt is very much up to members' good sense and integrity whether the\ncode will become their bible or another theoretical tract.\n\n\nThe code also does not appear to distinguish between the seriousness\nof practices that run foul of the law, like insider trading or share price\nmanipulation, and those that may be merely unfair, like not telling a\ncustomer what his effective charges or the potential risks may be.\n\n\nAnd while it is not possible to provide for every contingency -\nleaving no room for any creative ethical equivocation by practitioners - the\ncode appears not to have fully addressed the issue of proper business\nconduct.\n\n\nInstead, it has enumerated what is standard market practice.\n\n\nNow when ABS cannot even get members to toe the line in quoting\neffective interest rates a recommendation made last year without the full\nweight of MAS backing - can bank customers be sanguine that the more\ncomprehensive code will not be compromised, when pressure to build up market\nshare and improve bottom-line performance rises? \n\n\n The hope lies in enough bankers holding dear the principle of\nself-discilpline.\n\n\nThen they will respond to the challenge to keep their own house in\norder with an integrity and commitment to standards to match those exhibited\nby MAS.\n\n\nThey will make the effort to obey the code, both in letter and in\nlaw, an adherence which the draft enjoins.\n\n\nIf that happens, MAS will surely be the happier for it, because\nmarket discipline has an important role in creating a safe and sound banking\nsystem to meet customers' evolving needs - a role for which, as regulators,\nMAS is no substitute.\n\n\nThe scandal-racked Tokyo financial markets where a collapse of\nconfidence underlines the damage caused by low standards and lack of\nintegrity must surely help convince bankers here that high standards and\nintegrity pay in the long term.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'f0cc4cc7-79cc-40ee-a70e-b976bf4e197a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.844045+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9697384834289551, 'non_english_score': 0.030261516571044922}
{'text': "How to be a good Chinese  \n\n\n IN CALLING for a comprehensive report on the future direction of the\nChinese in Singapore, Member of Parliament Ow Chin Hock recently\nsuggested how various strands of an ongoing discussion could be put\ninto a cogent format.\n\n\nDr Ow, who is MP for Leng Kee, said that Chinese clans community\ngroups, private companies and Chinese- and English-educated\nintellectuals should come together to produce an objective report\ncovering the culture, language, education and value system of Chinese\nSingaporeans.\n\n\nDr Ow warned, however, that setting up an association to\nrepresent the interests of the Chinese community was premature.\n\n\nIts purpose might be misunderstood and seen as divisive, he said, but\nadded that the idea could be considered if a grassroots committee\nsuggested it.\n\n\nThe Singapore Chinese Teachers' Union, speaking out in support of Dr\nOw's call has urged the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations or\nthe Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry to organise a\nconference to set up the proposed committee. \n\n\n As these discussions take off, it might be appropriate to suggest a\nfew basic parameters for them.\n\n\nThe first is that there is no doubt that Singapore's Asian culture\nneeds to be preserved and that includes addressing the cultural issues\nconfronting the Chinese community.\n\n\nAny report that, calmly and dispassionately, suggests how this may be\ndone will be a contribution to the country's cultural vitality.\n\n\nHowever, it is essential to ensure that the legitimate attempt to\nchart a culturally Asian future for Singapore does not get hijacked into an\nEast-West diatribe of the kind that comes naturally to some, both in the West\nand in the East.\n\n\nThe way to avoid the problem is to avoid adopting two cultural\nextremes: treating values as universal ( so that the question of giving them\na geographical setting is meaningless); and treating values as geographically\nexclusive, with the added proviso that the values of one part of the world\nare all bad and the values of another are all good. \n\n\n Thus, there  are  such things as Asian values in the sense that they\noriginated in Asia, have become identified with Asian history or today\nplay a larger and deeper role in the lives of Asian peoples than of\nothers.\n\n\nHowever, these values might be present in a similar or comparable\nform in other parts of the world ( though they might not be given the same\ncultural weight as they do here).\n\n\nMore important, not all Asian values are good and Western values bad.\n\n\nIgnoring this might cause cultural preservation to boomerang; after\nall, just as some values have ensured Asia's success, others have\ncaused a by-no-means negligible list of weaknesses that once resulted in\nstagnant societies ripe for a colonial takeover.\n\n\nFeudal ideas and attitudes - whatever their real or presumed\njustification - are a prime suspect. \n\n\n The other idea worth keeping in mind is the need not to confuse values\nwith language.\n\n\nA language helps to convey values associated with a particular\nculture, but a language is not a value in itself.\n\n\nThus, Chinese values are best taught in Chinese ( though they may\nalso be taught in other languages), but the mere emphasis on Chinese will not\nresult in better preservation of Chinese values.\n\n\nIt is an entire way of life the family, school, place of work and\ninteraction with friends and strangers - that has to be made compatible with\nthe values being taught for these values to remain genuine.\n\n\nAlso, not only must values be taught, they must be practised as well,\nespecially so that the young find such practice both viable and fulfilling.\n\n\nIn this context, the needs of Singapore's multiracial society\nhave to be firmly remembered so that, in the correct desire to keep\nChinese culture viable, the domestic realities of Singapore and the external\nrealities of the region are not transgressed.  \n\n\n\n  Helping the Chinese poor  \n\n\n TO say that the idea of a  Chinese Mendaki  was inevitable\nis not to suggest that the merits and implications of such a move should not\nbe thoroughly explored first.\n\n\nAs the proposed body would not receive any government funding, it\nwould thus be essentially different from Mendaki itself.\n\n\nGiven that recent self-help efforts among the Malays and Muslims have\nbeen very much in the public eye, and the Indian community has plans to do\nsomething for the Indian underclass, it is natural that some in the Chinese\ncommunity would want to explore the idea of making some concerted efforts to\nhelp the poor among them.\n\n\nBut beyond recognising this, what the Chinese elite, and this refers\nto wealthy Chinese businessmen, politicians and community leaders, must do\nis: first establish that there is the same need in the Chinese\ncommunity for self-help efforts to be coordinated on a national scale. \n\n\n Several distinctions between the Chinese, the majority group, and the\nMalay and Indian minority groups are worth noting.\n\n\nFirst, there may not actually be a Chinese underclass like that in\nthe Malay and Indian communities.\n\n\nPoor Chinese there certainly are, but poor Chinese do often pull\nthemselves out of poverty through education, of themselves or their children,\nor by sheer dogged enterprise.\n\n\nNot many lapse into hopelessness and remain poor generation after\ngeneration as other less striving, materialistic and success-oriented peoples\nmight do.\n\n\nMoreover, the Chinese community as such is already the most\nwell-off among Singaporeans and it is safe to assume that while there are\npoor Chinese, their numbers are not disproportionate, which is the case for\nMalays or Indians.\n\n\nThen also, the Chinese who are poor are also probably less poor than\nother poor Singaporeans.\n\n\nSecond, poor Chinese are already being helped through a host of clan\nassociations and other mutual aid groups.\n\n\nWould a national organisation merely and needlessly duplicate\nor supplant these existing organisations?\n\n\nThis also raises the important issue of what role the current\norganisations which are looked to for leadership of the Chinese community -\nthe Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the\nFederation of Clan Associations - will play if a  Chinese Mendaki\n were to be set up.\n\n\nShould these two organisations - the first often seen as being\npreoccupied only with business interests, and the second, whom some in the\ncommunity itself think could also assist needy Chinese as much as they are\ntrying to do in cultural preservation - not take the initiative?\n\n\nThe first has the financial clout while the second has knowledge of\nthe ground.\n\n\nWould a joint effort by the Chinese Chamber and the Federation be the\nanswer to how best to coordinate and expand the community's aid to poor\nChinese.\n\n\nThese and other related issues should be explored by the Chinese\nelite as they decide whether a national, government-initiated Chinese\nself-help organisation is needed. \n\n\n But posing these questions does not imply that there are no merits in a\nspecial national organisation.\n\n\nA high-profile national Chinese welfare organisation could well\njolt well-off Chinese into being even more generous of time and money than\nthey now are.\n\n\nCharged with one main task and rising above the level of clans and\nother subgroups, it would be more single-minded, efficient and\nequitable in its dealings. \n\n\n The proposal has been made.\n\n\nWhat is needed now is frank, rational and practical consideration of\nall relevant issues.\n\n\nBut while this takes place, it should also be remembered that the\npractice of Singaporeans helping only members of their own community must\nnecessarily be an interim arrangement along the way to building a truly\nnational community of compassionate and self-reliant\nSingaporeans.\n\n\nLet not the interim arrangement endanger the realisation of the\nultimate dream.  \n\n\n\n  Retain the critical values  \n\n\n SINGAPORE needs to retain the core Confucian values that have propelled\nit to economic success, but this does mean jeopardising its multicultural\nideal.\n\n\nWith this unambiguous statement, made to the Chinese Press Club,\nPrime Minister Goh Chok Tong has cleared much of the unease created by recent\nevents suggesting a resurgence of Chinese chauvinism in Singapore.\n\n\nAs he sees it, the problem is not whether Chinese Singaporeans\nwill lose their cultural identity and values but whether the country can\nsurvive without these core values of thrift, hard work and group cohesion.\n\n\nThe rise of the East Asian economies of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan,\nHong Kong and Singapore has demonstrated that Confucian dynamism -\nthose values in Confucianism that do not retard innovation - has underpinned\ntheir remarkable success. \n\n\n There are several important messages in the Prime Minister's\nclarification.\n\n\nThe first is that the minorities should have no fear that Singapore\nis turning its back on the founding ideal of multiculturalism.\n\n\nChinese language and culture are not being promoted to overwhelm the\nother languages and cultures in the Singapore matrix.\n\n\nThe second message is an appeal to the English-educated Chinese not\nto discard the values of their forebears for the Western values of\nindividualism to which their English-medium education and experiences\nhave attuned them.\n\n\nThat the English-educated Chinese now form the majority of\nSingaporeans is the result of history and economics and an integral\npart of the country's material success.\n\n\nThat success could be threatened as more and more Chinese\nSingaporeans lose touch with their cultural traditions and values.\n\n\nThe obvious solution is to reinforce those critical values in\nthe present and coming generations of young Chinese Singaporeans who will\ncontinue to be educated primarily in English. \n\n\n Two approaches are needed.\n\n\nThe first is to lure them back to the study of the mother tongue\nthrough sound pedagogy and precept, not administrative coercion.\n\n\nThe next is to reach out to the adult English-educated Singaporeans\nto convince them that an understanding of Chinese culture widens their\nhorizons and deepens their perspective in a way that brings tangible\nadvantages.\n\n\nThis is both the more urgent and difficult task.\n\n\nThe response of the English-educated to the recent Chinese\nChamber of Commerce and Industry's series of cultural talks is telling.\n\n\nRecent events have confirmed what every thinking Singaporean\nhas suspected for the past decade - that a divide opening up in Singapore\nsociety is not between the haves and the have-nots but between the\nChinese-educated and the rest.\n\n\nThis gulf has to be bridged now.\n\n\nThis can be done only by a meeting of the two sides of the cultural\ndivide: the Chinese-educated must be magnanimous enough to put aside their\nfeelings of resentment and alienation, justifiable though they may be,\nto approach their English-educated compatriots.\n\n\nThe English-educated on their part must discard their attitudes\nof superiority and disregard to welcome the help extended by their\nChinese-educated brethren. \n\n\n What is needed is for men and women of goodwill on both sides -\nSingaporeans knowledgeable about their own cultural traditions and yet\nreceptive to the ideas and values of others - to come together, as cultural\nbrokers almost, to negotiate meeting of the two cultures.\n\n\nA working group of sensitive, sincere and stout-hearted people from\nboth sides could sit down to reflect, share, plan and create activities that\nwill penetrate the self-sufficiency of the English-educated Chinese and in\nthe process, re-examine and re-express their attitudes and beliefs.\n\n\nThis exercise in retaining and transmitting the values that\nhave served the nation well is something that cannot be left to time or\nchance.\n\n\nWisely directed, it can serve as the beginning for a coming together\nof all Singaporean cultures that will lead to the articulation of a set\nof particularly Singaporean values that all the people can live by.  \n\n\n\n  A balance of interests  \n\n\n DEPUTY Prime Minister Ong Teng Cheong made an important point on\nWednesday night when he spoke about the need for the Government to pay equal\nheed to the interests of all racial, language and religious groups.\n\n\nSpeaking at a Chinese Press Club dinner, he said English-educated\nSingaporeans must understand that the Government cannot answer\nall their needs without regard to those of the other groups.\n\n\nThe Chinese-educated, he explained, had felt ignored and shown their\nunhappiness at the ballot box.\n\n\nGiven his seniority in the political leadership and his feel for the\nChinese ground, no one should under-estimate the strength of feelings\nthat must have led the Government to come out openly to signal to the\nChinese-educated that it is sensitive to their feelings and would do\nwhat it can to fulfil their aspirations.  \n\n\n Yet two points can be made about this assessment.\n\n\nFirst, it is by no means settled judgment that the Chinese-educated\nfelt or still feel alienated because they regard themselves as having been\nshort-changed all along just because they are Chinese-educated.\n\n\nIf indeed they were alienated, there might well have been other\nreasons.\n\n\nOr, to look at the issue from another angle, just how important was\nthe perceived preferential treatment of the English-educated a factor in the\nway the Chinese ground voted?\n\n\nNo one can say for sure, which suggests caution in interpretation\nand follow-up action.\n\n\nA number of factors must have gone into the way people voted, and it\nis difficult to separate these and assign them relative weights.\n\n\nHowever, it cannot be denied that the Chinese intelligentsia is\nindeed concerned over what it sees as the increasing dominance of English in\nSingapore, evident not only in the language being the key to education and\nemployment opportunities, but also in the way changing values have put\nChinese language and culture on the defensive.\n\n\nThe PAP, as a party that represents all the major interests in\nSingapore, cannot but be responsive to that concern. \n\n\n The second question is this.\n\n\nNo matter how important Chinese ground support has been, and still\nis, to the PAP, its relative value will itself decrease as more and more\nSingaporeans choose and use English as their first language.\n\n\nThus it cannot have escaped the PAP that the risk is there of it\nalienating the increasing numbers of English-educated if it should slip in\nbalancing the various, and sometimes competing, interests.\n\n\nIt is perhaps a comment on the times that any party ruling Singapore\ntoday has no choice but to maintain an equilibrium between the Chinese-\neducated, broadly equated with being more conservative, and the\nEnglish-educated, seen generally as being more liberal. \n\n\n There can be no easy answers.\n\n\nThis country is not the exclusive preserve of any racial, linguistic\nor economic group.\n\n\nIt is necessary for each to recognise the importance of others in\nthat common national effort called Singapore.\n\n\nMr Ong's intention in talking openly about the needs of the\nChinese-educated was obviously not to suggest any dramatic changes.\n\n\nMore than anything else, his was a timely reminder to everyone of\npossible fault lines in society and the need to prevent them from opening up\nfurther.\n\n\nBut the solution lies not in changing what has served Singapore so\nwell all these years.\n\n\nTo maintain a fine balance of competing interests, all groups must\nknow when not to overstep the limits, or be too strident in voicing their\nown.\n\n\nThe Chinese-educated must recognise and accept that Singapore's\nposition in the international economic grid necessitates the continuation of\nEnglish as the language of business and administration.\n\n\nThe English-educated, on their part, must acknowledge the need for\ngive-and-take and do nothing that will lead other groups to feel deprived of\ntheir fair share of the fruits of Singapore's success.\n\n\nSingapore is about symbiosis - whether that is written in Chinese,\nMalay, Tamil or English.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '4ef3557c-74a4-49da-b60d-7c295930e480', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.845356+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9658871293067932, 'non_english_score': 0.03411287069320679}
{'text': "Daring to dream  \n\n\n  IT  was a dream many thought Singapore's\npolitical leaders were mad to try to pursue.\n\n\nBut that dream, that vision 30 years ago of transforming a colonial\ntrading post into a dynamic, industralised economy, is today an undeniable\nreality.\n\n\nThirty years ago, Singapore, with a per capita income of barely\nUS&dollar;450, was desperate to create jobs for its unemployed masses.\n\n\nNow the Republic boasts a per capita income of more than US&dollar;11,OO0 and\nthe planners worry about the long-standing labour shortage.\n\n\nPlaying a key role in turning that dream into humming factories and\nbusy offices has been the Economic Development Board.\n\n\nThe EDB set out to be a single-stop agency to attract the foreign\ninvestor to Singapore and help him in every way possible to do business.\n\n\nAnd in its single-minded pursuit of this goal, as Deputy Prime\nMinister Lee Hsien Loong said last night at the board's 30th anniversary\ncelebration, the EDB helped the government to focus all its policies -\nfinance, education, communications, infra-structure development - to promote\ngrowth.\n\n\nIt pushed hard to get the entire population of Singapore to go for\ngrowth.\n\n\nGovernment, unions, and employers all pulled in the same direction,\nand the EDB can take pride in having, over the last 30 years, propelled\nSingapore's economic development and its prosperity. \n\n\n What is the board's role in the next lap?\n\n\nBG Lee, who as Trade and Industry Ministry oversees the EDB,\nlast night outlined the three thrusts of the board's work in the years ahead.\n\n\nStrength in specific niches, international reach, and high quality\nlabour - the key factors in keeping Singapore competitive.\n\n\nThe board's role, once predominantly to persuade foreign companies to\ncome to Singapore, now includes the challenge of helping Singapore companies\nidentify and grasp opportunities abroad so they can become world-class\nplayers.\n\n\nIn pursuing this goal, cold logic demands that the effort and\nresources available be allocated mainly to those companies with the best hope\nof becoming Singapore MNCs. \n\n\n But there must remain, alongside the logic and hard calculations, that\nroom for gambles, for dreams.\n\n\nFor small-scale entrepreneurs to turn to the EDB and other government\nagencies for help in trying to turn their dreams, what might seem to be\nwild dreams, into business success.\n\n\nIn the global competition for business, it may well be the Singapore\nInc approach that will give Singapore companies the best chance of success.\n\n\nBut Singapore Inc should not smother the small entrepreneur, for they\nare integral to the Singapore economy.\n\n\nThis the EDB undoubtedly recognises, and when the Strategic Economic\nPlan is unveiled in October, there will surely be measures designed to\nhelp give local entrepreneurs a leg up the business world.\n\n\nFor Singapore needs all its players, big and small, to keep pushing\ntowards new horizons.\n\n\nTo dare to dream.  \n\n\n\n  Bridging those divisions  \n\n\n  BIRTHDAYS  are neat milestones in a life, as much\nfor nations as for people.\n\n\nSingapore's 26th birthday today is especially notable because\nit is the first National Day for the Goh Chok Tong government.\n\n\nThe last 26 years have been a success story for Singapore, so much so\nthat, as Mr Goh noted in his eve of National Day address last night, the\nnation's problems are now the problems of affluence - obesity, controlling\nthe number of cars, and meeting the aspirations of a population\naccustomed to rapid progress and high standards.\n\n\nPrime Minister Goh said last night that he wants to build on the\ntrack record of the past 26 years, and to sustain Singapore's economic\ndevelopment and social progress. \n\n\n Continued economic growth is fundamental to Singapore's future.\n\n\nWithout it, there will not be the social progress, the luxury of\nother kinds of advancement - ever higher standards of education, healthier\nand more varied lifestyles, greater freedom of choice, the finer things in\nlife generally.\n\n\nThis economic growth will be affected by developments external to\nSingapore and beyond its control.\n\n\nThe world has been seen some dramatic changes in the last few years,\nmostly for the better.\n\n\nBut there have been the unwelcome developments, such as the stalemate\nin the GATT talks.\n\n\nIf this is unresolved and the world moves further towards\nprotectionism and trade blocs, Singapore's economic progress will be\nmade that much harder.\n\n\nBut good planning, strategic positioning.\n\n\nand the right reflexes - by both the government and the people - will\nhelp Singapore ride the economic ups and downs that may be ahead. \n\n\n Much as steering the economy in the right direction will remain a\npriority of the government under Mr Goh, the Prime Minister last night\nsaid his main objective is  people bonding  - drawing\nSingaporeans together in an extended family, in that sense of being part of a\nwhole.\n\n\nThis indeed is the critical task in the years ahead.\n\n\nWe are still in the process, intellectually and emotionally, of\ndefining 'the Singaporean'.\n\n\nRace, religion, and language are still potentially problematic\nissues.\n\n\nThere are other divisions that need to be bridged - between the\nEnglish-educated and the Chinese-educated; between socio-economic\nclasses.\n\n\nAnd there is the growing need to answer the question of how a\nnational identity can be maintained in an increasingly borderless world.\n\n\nThese are the issues Mr Goh wants to address in the years ahead, for\nit is in finding those bridges and answers that Singapore's continued success\nlies.\n\n\nThis year's National Day theme is My Singapore.\n\n\nIt is an apt theme for the first National Day of Singapore's next\nphase of development.\n\n\nIf more and more Singaporeans can make that declaration with\nconviction, both intellectual and emotional, then Singapore should continue\nto have many more good years ahead.  \n\n\n\n  Levelling, Singapore style  \n\n\n  OVER THE  next few weeks, or even months,\nwe may need to ponder deeply the meaning of Prime Minister Goh Chok\nTong's maiden National Day rally speech last Sunday.\n\n\nIts full import may take some time to sink in.\n\n\nBut, sooner rather than later, it will be plain how major a landmark\nhis state-of-the-nation address will be in the evolution of Singaporean\nsociety.\n\n\nMr Goh has always typified his leadership as one of continuity.\n\n\nIf change there must be, it is more in style.\n\n\nYet, he has been introducing policy shifts that are more of substance\nthan mere form.\n\n\nGradually, Mr Goh is emerging as a leader with his own mind.\n\n\nThe most indisputable evidence of this was the speech on\nSunday.\n\n\nWhen have we heard a government leader talk so passionately about the\nneed to  level up  Singaporean society, balancing the elitist\nface of Singapore with a more caring touch for the less able? \n\n\n For 26 years, Singapore has been built on the foundation of the\nmeritocratic idealism of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.\n\n\nThe system that has been entrenched is one in which the best and the\nbrightest are nurtured.\n\n\nThe system has worked in the context of Singapore's needs, and has\nbecome an inseparable part of the Singaporean identity.\n\n\nBut it has been tough.\n\n\nAnd some have opted out, voting with their feet.\n\n\nIt is therefore a mark of bold resolve, and certainly of\nleadership, on the part of Mr Goh to want to temper a system that has become the\nanchor upon which Singapore has survived for 26 years.\n\n\nIt is yet another stamp of his emerging political personality that he\nis doing this within a clear and coherent framework, steering the changes\nthrough without rocking established norms in what is clearly a dualism of\nchange and continuity. \n\n\n And so we are seeing, alongside present policies such as the Gifted\nprogramme for the brightest of our children, a specific set of new\ninitiatives clearly designed to benefit the non-elites who form the bulk of\nthe nation; initiatives in three key areas - housing, education, and\nhealth.\n\n\nHe is going to push home ownership to its limits.\n\n\nHe is opening up more opportunities in education for all, not just\nthe most able.\n\n\nHe is taking care of the health needs of Singaporeans who cannot\nafford expensive hospitals.\n\n\nBringing them all together neatly, he describes his aim as that of\nbuilding a caring, extended Singaporean family.\n\n\nMr Goh has thought it all through.\n\n\nHe has stamped his brand of leadership on the Prime Minister's job,\nand he now wants a clear mandate to proceed.\n\n\nMr Goh will be calling a general election soon.\n\n\nWith his popularity already so clear, Mr Goh's new thinking on the\npolicy front is likely to boost his standing, given the fact that there is so\nlittle in his plans to fault.\n\n\nDeciding whether or not to have him as Prime Minister is not going to\nbe a difficult choice.  \n\n\n\n  A greater stake in S'pore  \n\n\n  AS A  long-term investment, there are few\ninstruments that can beat property especially residential property,\nin land scarce Singapore.\n\n\nPrime Minister Goh Chok Tong's recent proposal to allow Housing Board\nflat-owners to own private residential property is therefore a good one and\nmany Singaporeans are looking forward to a change in the rules. \n\n\n The suggestion, which was put forward last Sunday at Mr Goh's first\nNational Day Rally speech as Prime Minister, will not only gladden the\nhearts of HDB home owners but also property developers, as it comes at a time\nwhen property prices are softening.\n\n\nThe Housing Board has, in fact, been gradually relaxing its\nrules.\n\n\nFor instance, since August last year, private home owners have been\nallowed to purchase HDB and HUDC flats in the resale market so long as they\ncomply with certain other conditions and live in these public flats. \n\n\n Mr Goh's proposal will also be welcome news to those with tidy sums in\ntheir Central Provident Fund accounts and looking around for suitable\ninvestments.\n\n\nWhile the CPF has relaxed its rules and allows the purchase of second\nproperties using savings with the board, HDB owners have not been able to\nenjoy the full benefits without having to sell their flats.\n\n\nThey can, however, own commercial property - an anomaly to those who\nargue that both commercial and residential properties are good investments in\nthe long run.\n\n\nWhile HDB home owners can invest their CPF savings in gold,\ncommercial property and shares, including property shares, they cannot at\npresent use the money to buy private homes unless they quit their HDB flats.\n\n\nMr Goh's suggestion is therefore a logical expansion of the\ninvestment options open to HDB home owners.\n\n\nThe condition that the investor should continue to live in his\nHousing Board flat will ensure that the private property is an investment.\n\n\nFurther conditions should be attached to ensure that the private\nproperty is a long-term investment and not just a short-term speculative\nflutter. \n\n\n While some may argue that those who can afford private homes should not\nbe allowed to own subsidised public housing, it must also be borne in mind\nthat the proposal will benefit, although not immediately, a majority of\nSingaporeans as 87 per cent of the population live in HDB flats.\n\n\nAlso, as the HDB gradually reduces its subsidies and moves closer\ntowards market rates, this argument will hold less water.\n\n\nAllowing HDB flat owners to buy private property without having\nto quit their present abodes will help at least to maintain their HDB\nproperty values as it should reduce the number of people putting up HDB\nflats for resale.\n\n\nIf the HDB relaxes its rules on the purchase of private\nproperty, this will not only offer to its tenants another investment option\nbut also a greater stake in Singapore.  \n\n\n\n  Openness must remain  \n\n\n  THE DUST  has begun to settle on what was\na watershed election.\n\n\nA watershed not just because it produced three more opposition\nmembers of parliament but because it was an election that saw Mr Goh Chok\nTong getting the endorsement of his prime ministership from\nSingaporeans rather than just his People's Action Party colleagues.\n\n\nAnd because it was an election Mr Goh fought on the strength of the\nnew style of government he believes Singapore now needs. \n\n\n The post-election analyses vary as to what the result said of that\nstrategy of Mr Goh's, and indeed of his style. \n\n\nIn giving him 61 per cent rather than the 64 or 65 per cent of valid\nvotes he was looking for, were voters expressing their concern over\nbread and butter issues such as rising living costs and missing\nincense-burning bins?\n\n\nWas the working class voicing its frustration with its lot in life?\n\n\nWas the conservative segment of Singapore signalling its\ndistress at too rapid a move towards a liberal climate?\n\n\nWas this conservative segment primarily the Chinese-educated\nwho felt the PAP under Mr Goh, had ignored their views and concerns in its\neagerness to keep the English-educated happy? \n\n\nIt was, surely, a combination of all these factors, and more.\n\n\nThe PAP leaders have, however, identified as a key factor the\nsurfacing of a tussle between the liberals and the conservatives, between the\nEnglish-educated and the Chinese-educated.\n\n\nA division, in other words, between those who heartily support Mr\nGoh's open and more liberal style and those who fear what it might mean for\nmoral values, for the discipline and the order which have been hallmarks of\nSingapore for so long.\n\n\nThe three opposition candidates who defeated the PAP incumbents\nwere Chinese-educated, so it would appear that it was the Chinese-educated\nconservative voters who were asserting their interests in this election.\n\n\nBut much as the PAP government will want to find ways to renew its\nfeel for the Chinese ground and take into account the concerns of more\nconservative Singaporeans when it makes policies, it will surely not want to\nover-react.\n\n\nTo interpret the election outcome from just one perspective and to\nthen shift into policies and approaches in line with this perspective wou1d\nrun the risk of alienating other segments of Singapore society.\n\n\nThe fact is the conservative-liberal divide cuts across all\nlanguage and ethnic groups, and the voters who said 'yes' to the opposition\non Aug 31 did so for a variety of reasons.\n\n\nThe Prime Minister has said he intends to press on with his open\nstyle of government, though he will have to slow the speed of his changes and\nmake sure he has all segments of Singapore moving with him.\n\n\nThis is reassuring.\n\n\nIt is this openness, the participative kind of government that Mr\nGoh and so many Singaporeans believe in, that Singapore needs at this stage\nof its development.\n\n\nThe tussle for attention between the conservatives and liberals,\nbetween the many interest groups there are in Singapore - this is inevitable\nat this point.\n\n\nIndeed it is a necessary and healthy part of the process of change,\nof the transition from a centrally controlled polity to one where citizens\nparticipate in the governing of their country.\n\n\nThis transition requires more debate, a greater willingness by\nSingaporeans to voice their views and to argue their case.\n\n\nIt is from this lively debate and exchange of views that people\nlearn to understand and accept that there are other ways of looking at\nissues, and to want to find ways to seek compromises and arrive at consensus.\n\n\nThis is what participative government is all about, and what will\nadd to the long term stability of Singapore.", 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '38c34cc4-09e1-454b-b986-c85064882041', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.846785+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9746220111846924, 'non_english_score': 0.025377988815307617}
{'text': 'A step to the Next Lap  \n\n\n\n WITH speculation about an early general election in the air recently,\nPrime Minister Goh Chok Tong\'s disclosure last Sunday that it would indeed be\nheld  way before  the end-1993 deadline has come as no great\nsurprise to many.\n\n\nOf course, Mr Goh had said after the 1988 poll that he planned to have\nthe new Parliament sit for the full five-year term, something unprecedented\nin Singapore history.\n\n\nThe longest Parliament has sat between general elections is four years\nand seven months, the shortest just a day short of four years.\n\n\nBut conditions change and Mr Goh, and his advisers, obviously feel\nthat it is unnecessary, perhaps even unwise, to put the polls off till the\nmandated expiry of the present Parliament.\n\n\nAnd, as virtually everyone has noted, the current situation\ncertainly looks ideal for the ruling People\'s Action Party - quite\napart from the chronic disarray and unpreparedness of the opposition parties.\n\n\n\n\n The economy is purring along nicely, at a rate that is higher than can be\nexpected to last for much longer, but not so high that labour shortages\nand high wages are squeezing the numerically significant small\nemployers who might be inclined to take it out on the PAP when they are\nhurting.\n\n\nThe cost of living, a hot topic not long ago, has lost much of its\nbite now that most of the increases in public fees and charges have been\nannounced and implemented.\n\n\nSimilarly the initial unhappiness over the car quota scheme now that\nthe Government has yielded to public criticism and agreed to try out\nnon-transferable certificates entitlement for a year.\n\n\nIn education, fears over the unaffordability of independent schools\nappear to have died down and the clamour for more places for higher education\nhas been dampened with the announcement that a fourth polytechnic and an open\nuniversity are on the way.\n\n\nThe government has also deflected somewhat rising medical\ncosts as an issue by its recent assurances on continued subsidies and Mr\nGoh\'s announcement that he was considering an endowment fund to top up\nMedisave accounts of the needy. \n\n\n\n The mood is sweet over the intangibles too.\n\n\nMalays who were unhappy with the Government at the last election have\nbeen reassured by its demonstrations since of continued support for the\ncommunity\'s aspirations while Indians who were chagrined because they thought\nthey deserved similar help are presumably pleased by the Government\'s\nsupport for their newly established self-help organisation, the Singapore\nIndian Development Association.\n\n\nThe majority Chinese population too has been soothed by an\nunprecedented degree of attention to their concerns, especially over language\nand culture, and assurances that the government cares as much for the welfare\nof the Chinese poor as for minority poor.\n\n\nIn nonracial terms, the desire of younger,\nEnglish-educated Singaporeans for a more relaxed regimen has been\naccommodated by a\nliberalisation of film censorship, balanced by promises to older or more\nconservative citizens that this can be moderated if that is what they want.\n\n\n In setting himself the full-term target in 1988, Mr Goh spoke of needing\nthe time to forge a new working relationship with the people of Singapore.\n\n\nIt is clear now that, in true PAP style, he had been unduly cautious.\n\n\nAlthough former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew remains in the Cabinet\nand plays an important role, Mr Goh has succeeded in putting his own\ndistinctive stamp and, to a lesser extent, agenda, on Singapore in his mere\neight months at the helm.\n\n\nSo the election is not merely a question of getting the people\'s\nmandate for the policies of the next few years.\n\n\nIt is also to measure public approval of Mr Goh personally, to\nconfirm that the Cabinet\'s choice of Mr Goh as Prime Minister is also the\npeople\'s choice.\n\n\nThat would mark the crossing of another threshold in the political\ntransition in Singapore, signifying that the nation has truly moved on to the\nNext Lap.  \n\n\n\n\n  Celebrate the S\'pore spirit  \n\n\n\n A GREAT little nation: This is certainly an exhilarating vision of\nwhat Singapore could be.\n\n\nBut visions can remain vague and dreams can evaporate in the\nclamour of the immediate and the urgent.\n\n\nAs Singapore turns 26 in a fervour of soul-searching and\nintrospection, it is a good time to turn people\'s thoughts to just what this\naspiration might mean.\n\n\nThe Next Lap has given substance to this vision but what\nSingaporeans can do to spur themselves on is to reflect on and realise what\ntheir country has been about, to understand the spirit that makes Singapore.\n\n\nThis spirit is something one could call a Singaporean virtue, virtue\nnot as in virtuousness, which is smug, but virtue as the hallmark or essence\nof what being Singaporean has become.\n\n\nIn this critical self-analysis, where does one begin?\n\n\nA good place is the past, for the past is often a beginning to the\nfuture. \n\n\n\n Twenty-six years ago Singapore was a state founded on the inauspicious\ndiscovery that it was not, after all, to be part of a larger, reassuring\nentity; that it was, in the cold-eyed assessment of its founding leaders, a\ncountry not meant to be.\n\n\nMany transformations have since been wrought.\n\n\nThe island that feared for its survival is now a city-state,\ngleaming, prosperous and renowned for its success.\n\n\nThe trading port no larger than a speck on the map is now the hub of\nair and sea routes reaching right across the world.\n\n\nEconomic prosperity has been achieved through Western science and\ntechnology but within a tightly co-ordinated economic and\nsocio-political system inspired more by Asian paternalism and Confucian\nconcepts of social order than Western libertarian ideals.\n\n\nA crowded island that might have turned into a sad cluster of slums\nand ghettoes is now a garden city with green lungs and nature reserves.\n\n\nA collection of immigrants, ethnically and culturally diverse\nwho overnight, almost three decade ago, found themselves citizens of\nSingapore, are now earnestly charting a joint destiny.\n\n\nThese transformations surely testify to the Singapore spirit, to that\nvirtue of making positives out of negatives, of turning inhospitable\nenvironments into conditions for success. \n\n\n\n What is the secret formula - Confucian core values, visionary and\ndedicated leaders and a wisely responsive people, Western education and\ntechnology, the sheer grit of people with nothing left to lose or merely the\nfavour of the gods?\n\n\nOr was it a winning combination of all these?\n\n\nWhat matters now is not which factors went into the formula or how\nmuch each contributed to it.\n\n\nWhat matters is that all Singaporeans should grasp and celebrate that\nvirtue that makes strength out of vulnerability, and take pride in being\npeople who will work to turn adversity into good fortune.\n\n\nThen will Singapore continue to stake out paths and possibilities few\nothers venture on.\n\n\nThe challenges of the future beckon: A state forged under a\nheavy authoritarian hand must now develop, without trauma and mishaps along\nthe way, into a nation of confident, self-motivated individuals; a society\nthat needs to remain fiercely competitive must yet feel a caring generosity\nfor those handicapped for the race or who fall by the wayside; a people\nbeginning to weary of the constant effort to excel must steel themselves for\nyet more striving; a younger generation must be allowed to grow up innovative\nand independent and yet keep united in purpose; a country poised precariously\nat the confluence of East and West, of old and new must find its own\nequilibrium; a people who see the world as their marketplace must remain\nanchored in the regional fold, and a people whose horizons span the world,\nwho travel, work and live in lands across the seas must call Singapore home.\n\n\n\n A nation not meant to be, but a people who thrived in achieving near\nimpossibles can surely strive yet again to become one of the more\nremarkable communities on the Pacific Rim.  \n\n\n\n\n  People-bonding the way ahead  \n\n\n IN the nine months since he became Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong\nhas brought about a participatory style of government which\nSingaporeans, accustomed to years of firm, paternalistic rule under Mr Lee Kuan Yew,\nfound liberating and refreshing.\n\n\nThe new Prime Minister\'s open and consultative style has gone down\nwell with many Singaporeans who see in him a leader who is not only willing\nto listen but also has empathy for the concerns of the common man.\n\n\nThis impression was clearly reinforced by his well-received\nperformance in his maiden National Day Rally address.\n\n\nBut it is hardly style alone that distinguishes Mr Goh.\n\n\nThe underlying theme in his approach to governance has been a strong\ndesire to instil in Singaporeans a sense of oneness and of sharing a common\ndestiny.\n\n\nThis philosophy is founded on the premise that unity - in his words,\npeople-bonding - is essential to Singapore\'s continued existence and\nwell-being, a point Mr Goh made very clear in both his eve of National Day\nmessage and National Day Rally address. \n\n\n Hence the emphasis on the need for Singaporeans to consider\nthemselves as part of an extended family of sorts, with the able being\nurged to lend the less-able a helping hand.\n\n\nIt is unquestionably a sound approach.\n\n\nFor it is through the fostering of such a spirit of mutual support\nthat negative feelings of envy can be ameliorated somewhat.\n\n\nAs Mr Goh noted correctly, there are nascent demonstrations of\njealousy among the not-so-successful which must be nipped in the bud if\nSingapore is not to go the way of the communist countries.\n\n\nWhile meritocracy has been, and will always be, the guiding principle\nof Singapore society, there is no under-estimating the importance of\nthose who have made it being seen to be sparing a thought for and helping\nthose who have not and those who are not likely to.\n\n\nIn so doing, they help to foster a feeling of togetherness. \n\n\n The major policy initiatives Mr Goh has taken since assuming office -\nEdusave, Medifund and housing - have all been geared towards making all\nSingaporeans feel that they not only expected to do their part for the\ncountry but that their country can do something for them in return.\n\n\nThe message he has been sending seems to be: Support the government\nand the government will support you in return.\n\n\nAs a social contract, this has been widely accepted as a fair deal.\n\n\nMr Goh\'s initiatives are not handouts in the socialist tradition;\nneither do people expect the policies to have the equalising effects of\ncentrally-planned economies which have proved to be so disastrous.\n\n\nWhat is significant, however, is that Singaporeans are now\nexperiencing the effects of a new leadership which has adapted itself\nto the evolving needs of the population.\n\n\nAnd they seem to be largely appreciative of the changes thus wrought.\n\n\n\n For the better part of Singapore\'s modern political history, the\nrunning of the country has been in the hands of a small core group of people\nwho called the shots.\n\n\nDecisions taken were largely handed down.\n\n\nIt was democracy by will.\n\n\nThe hallmark of the Goh administration has been to open the doors\nslightly to the decision-making process.\n\n\nPolicies are now debated openly and clearly this change is\nnecessitated by the new demands of an electorate made up of younger and\nbetter-educated Singaporeans who are questioning the tight rule which might\nhave been appropriate and necessary, in the past.\n\n\nSingaporeans have over the past nine months had a fair measure of the\nkind of government they can expect under Mr Goh.\n\n\nAnd indications are that they are largely in favour of his open-style\ngovernment which is more in tune with the times.\n\n\nIf that is the case, there can only be one logical response to Mr\nGoh\'s call for a solid mandate for him to carry his policies further.\n\n\nSay " yes" to him and give him a fresh mandate to do things for\nSingaporeans his way when the time comes.  \n\n\n\n\n  Obligations of the able  \n\n\nTHE Prime Minister in speaking of the growing gap between the able\nand affluent and the less able and less well-off has touched on a source of\npotential conflict within Singapore society. \n\n\nThe less able show signs of resentment and envy while the able and\naffluent are self-centred and uncaring of others\' needs.\n\n\nIt is a growing trend and an unhealthy gap, whose root causes are\nmany.\n\n\nSome suggest that education is to blame.\n\n\nEducationist will think it is a system too openly appreciative of\ntalent that tolerates, or worse, creates the kind of education that\ndistinguishes too starkly between the able and the average or slow learner.\n\n\nStill others philosophically see it as the innate self-centredness\nof human beings that is blind to the needs and feelings of others and,\nespecially, of those unlike their kind.\n\n\nOne of the Government\'s early strategies in nation-building was to\nscour the island for talent to develop to staff the leadership positions in\nevery field.\n\n\nThis was the right move as it quickly channelled much-needed talent\nto the civil service to run the country.\n\n\nIn those days, government scholarships and other forms of financial\naid went almost exclusively to children from really poor families who might\nhave been deprived of an education and a chance in life otherwise.\n\n\nThe top scholars and a host of other able people who were helped in\none way or another to rise through the system naturally carried with them a\nsense of indebtedness to a society which thus lifted them up from their\nhumble beginnings.\n\n\nTheir rise also benefited the country; in fact, it created the\nefficient leadership that pushed the country fast forward to prosperity.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Singaporeans became largely middle-class and the numbers\nof the really poor dwindled.\n\n\nThe first levelling up had begun.\n\n\nBut after each levelling up must come a time of pushing the more\nable in the next generation upward so that they can be the leaders who will\nnext take the country forward.\n\n\nWhen the benefits of more progress permeate down and the whole\ncountry is better off yet again, another levelling up is achieved.\n\n\nBut this is an Olympian view of society\'s progress not naturally\naccepted by the less privileged masses confronted daily with the\nconspicuously lavish lifestyles of the well-off.\n\n\nMuch as we dislike the fact, while ideals can be egalitarian, people\nare not made equal.\n\n\nBut acceptance of inequality demands a rationality and objectivity\nthat goes against the human grain.\n\n\nIt is in the nature of society to be hierarchical.\n\n\nIn the meantime, the second generation of able people do not feel\nthe same sense of indebtedness simply because they needed less help from the\nstate, their families being better off than the early recipients of state\nassistance.\n\n\nOther factors are at work too.\n\n\nMaterial well-being has a special seductiveness that can deny all\nother claims and blind those enthralled to all other values.\n\n\nThe yuppie in single-minded pursuit of monetary success and social\nrecognition does not see beyond himself.\n\n\nThis is not a peculiarly Singaporean problem.\n\n\nIn every society the haves are envied and resented by the have-nots.\n\n\nWhat is different about Singapore is that it has the resources - of\nexperience in successful social engineering, of communication between the\ngovernment and the people, of sufficient funds for education and other social\nservices, of small size and hence cohesiveness, to name only the most obvious\n- to tackle the problem.\n\n\nThe meritocracy in Singapore, orderly, transparent and open, is\nalive and well.\n\n\nBut for it to endure and ensure the nation\'s continued economic\nprogress, it will need those who are able and successful to constantly care\nand help the less well-endowed in their midst.\n\n\nIf this is not seen to be done, the less well-endowed who are the\nnatural majority can endanger the political stability crucial to national\nwell-being.\n\n\nThis is something the able and successful ignore at their own\nperil.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source':

{'text': 'Voting on Mr Goh  \n\n\n THE  plaintive cry that the Government is being\n unfair  in calling for election on Aug 31 is a little rich,\nand wondrously naive.\n\n\nAlthough called at far shorter notice than previous general elections,\nwhich were usually preceded by months of official hints that polls were in\nthe offing, the coming election is hardly a total surprise either.\n\n\nEver since Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong began his community visits in\nJune and the  subsequent announcement of a three-month\nbonus for civil servants, speculation has been rife that an early election\nwas on the way.\n\n\nWhen he confirmed early this month that this would indeed be the case,\nthe only question left was when exactly, with many observers noting that the\npresent was ideal from the  point of view.\n\n\nThe main opposition parties themselves came very close to the\nmark with their guesses: Potong Pasir MP and Singapore Democratic Party\nleader Chiam See Tong predicted a September poll, while Workers\' Party leader\nJB Jeyaretnam told everyone that it would definitely be before Nov 10, when\nthe 1986 prohibition on his running for Parliament ends. </sent> \n\n\n But knowing that an election is imminent and being ready for it are\ntotally different things.\n\n\nAnd the opposition, despite Mr Chiam and Jeyaretnam declaring\nthat their parties are prepared, is hardly in the same league as the ruling\nPeople\'s Action Party, which National Development Minister S Dhanabalan\naccurately likened to a machine which is always ready, needing only a press\nof the button to run. </sent>\n\n\nAs we noted in an Insight feature early this month, the opposition is\nstill running the last lap - although dozing might be a more appropriate\ndescription for most of the parties.\n\n\nMost are not even parties, except in name, being mainly the personal\nvehicles for a few individuals with pretensions to being politicians but who\nare nowhere to be seen or heard between elections.\n\n\nThe SDP and the WP are active throughout the year, but only in a very\nlimited way since each party has a mere 100 or so active members - some of\nthem working strictly for themselves.\n\n\nThey are not the stuff to frighten a government, let alone form one.\n\n\n\n None of the opposition expects to do the latter, of course.\n\n\nAll they can hope for is to increase their share of the votes and\npossibly win a few seats.\n\n\nObviously, their prospects would improve if the election were much\nlater.\n\n\nIt gives them time to find candidates, pick the most promising\nconstituencies to contest and in general crank themselves up to run.\n\n\nAnd, doubtless, they hope for a change in the public mood which would\nfavour them.\n\n\nAs the WP\'s Dr Lee Siew Choh noted in the Insight article,\nSingapore voters   only want an opposition when things are bad.\nIf the economy is booming and everyone is happy, it will be tough for\nus   .\n\n\nIt certainly looks as if it will be, which is unfortunate for the\nopposition, but hardly the fault of the Government.\n\n\nLike democratic governments everywhere else, the Government here\nnaturally seeks to maximise its own votes, not help the opposition, which\nmust win their own votes. \n\n\n Their best chances probably lie with Singaporeans who want an opposition\nfor the sake of opposition because there is really nothing at the moment to\nexercise voters against the Government.\n\n\nBesides having the economy in his favour, Mr Goh has also defused\nwhat could have been issues for the opposition by his announcement of\nmeasures to help average and lower-income Singaporeans in respect of health\ncare, housing and education, his agreeing to non-transferable certificates\nof entitlement for cars and promises to expand higher education\nopportunities.\n\n\nFor ordinary Singaporeans, the real issue is really Mr Goh himself,\nas heir to Mr Lee Kuan Yew, but going one better in terms not only of a more\nopen, relaxed style, but of kinder, gentler policies as well.\n\n\nAlthough the opposition has already dismissed the changes as\ncosmetic, we strongly suspect that Singaporeans know better - and will render\ntheir verdict accordingly on Aug 31.  \n\n\n\n\n  Make every vote count  \n\n\n THERE could not have been a more poignant backdrop for Nomination Day in\nSingapore than the crisis that threatened at one stage to tip the Soviet\nUnion over the brink and into all-out civil war.\n\n\nIt was entirely fortuitous, of course, that Mikhail Gorbachev\'s\nouster from power by a motley cabal of generals and communist hardliners\nshould have come just as Singaporeans began the democratic process of picking\ntheir own leaders for the next five years.\n\n\nBe that as it may, it cannot but bode ill for a Singapore ever\nvulnerable to the winds of change if its citizens were to ignore this\ndramatic reminder of just how uncertain, and perilous, life could be.\n\n\nEducation Minister Tony Tan put his finger on it when, speaking on\nTuesday night, he urged Singaporeans to ponder, in the cold, clear light of\nthe cataclysmic events that have shaken the world, just what the General\nElection ought to be about.\n\n\nThe answer, even if he did not supply it, is obvious: The election\nshould be about returning, unambiguously, the party that can best see\nSingapore through the years ahead.\n\n\nIf the tragedy that is unfolding in Moscow, and its impact on peace\nand stability across the globe, is too distant an event to jolt the mind into\nfocusing on the crucial choice to he made on Aug 31, then consider one that\noccurred closer home just two weeks ago - the joint exercise by Malaysian and\nIndonesian troops barely 20 km north of the Causeway.\n\n\nWhat more do Singaporeans need to grasp the importance of having in\nplace a strong government which enjoys their unequivocal confidence and which\ncan stand up to provocations or tests they do not want but will come anyway?\n\n\n\n All this is not scare-mongering.\n\n\nIt is about making a sober choice.\n\n\nIt is about seeing things in perspective.\n\n\nAnd it is about lifting one\'s sight above the sound and simulated\nfury of an election with no real issues in order to focus on the one that\ntruly matters - whether Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong deserves a clear mandate\nto carry out the programmes outlined in The Next Lap and carry on with his\nopen, more consultative style of government.\n\n\nHe has put himself on the line and asked Singaporeans for\nendorsement in the most direct of terms: " Every vote you withhold from me,\nor worse, you give to the opposition, will weaken my political position after\nthe election. Every vote that you give me will increase my political\nweight, in the country, in the Cabinet and in Parliament. I seek\nevery vote. I need every vote that you can give me."\n\n\nThere are no two ways about it. \n\n\n What makes this general election different from previous ones is that\nhere is the prime minister of the day asking not just for his government to\nbe returned but also that he be given a clear signal in the form of increased\nvotes for the People\'s Action Party, that Singaporeans want him and what he\nstands for.\n\n\nThe distinction is important.\n\n\nA mandate for the PAP to govern is, well, a foregone conclusion\nbecause Singaporeans, by and large, do not want any other.\n\n\nWhat Mr Goh needs is the endorsement of more votes as that will give\nhim the legitimacy to say he has carried the country with him.\n\n\nThis is what representative government boils down to.\n\n\nHe is now the issue. \n\n\n\n While there is little doubt that he, as a leader and as a person, is well\nreceived by most Singaporeans, the choice for some, or many, is not that\nstraightforward, given their inclination to want also to vote in an\nopposition.\n\n\nBut they cannot have it both ways.\n\n\nThey should ask themselves some tough questions.\n\n\nWhat has the opposition candidate standing in their constituency done\nto deserve their support?\n\n\nWhat do they expect him to do in Parliament and can he deliver?\n\n\nDoes it make sense to approve of Mr Goh, his policies and his\ngoverning style, and yet have him diminished by denying him the vote he\nneeds?\n\n\nEvery Singaporean whose mind is not made up will have to find his own\nanswers.\n\n\nHis vote counts as it will help determine this country\'s destiny.\n\n\nHe owes it to himself and his family not to gamble with it.  \n\n\n\n\n  Give Goh a clear mandate  \n\n\n SINGAPOREANS go to the polls today, the seventh since Independence, faced\nwith, essentially, only two key issues: the call by the People\'s Action Party\n( PAP) for a resounding endorsement of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong\'s style\nof government and his new policies, versus the Singapore Democratic Party (\nSDP) line that there must be stronger opposition in Parliament.\n\n\nBoth are serious issues.\n\n\nAre they mutually exclusive?\n\n\nYes, says the PAP.\n\n\nNo, says the SDP.\n\n\nThe Workers\' Party\'s answer - that the question is irrelevant - is\nbereft of sense.\n\n\nWhatever Mr Goh\'s reason for calling a snap election two years ahead\nof schedule - that is his prerogative, as the incumbent Prime Minister - it\nhas to be fought by the opposition.\n\n\nCalling it an  unnecessary  election is no campaign line.\n\n\nThe SDP\'s line at least has the merit of being clever: With the PAP\nreturned to power, having secured 41 out of 81 seats on Nomination Day, Mr\nGoh already has the mandate he wants; so vote in more opposition members,\nsays SDP leader Chiam See Tong. \n\n\n\n Mr Chiam\'s line would have been seductive to more voters if not for the\nPAP\'s effective campaign strategy, the most focused in recent elections.\n\n\nMr Goh surprised many when he said, early in the campaign: \n I am the issue.  \n\n\nVoters have heard again and again in the last nine days that the\nissue is his style of governing.\n\n\nThe word " style " does not do justice to what Mr Goh stands\nfor.\n\n\nWhat he is presenting to Singaporeans is a whole new political\nculture for the country.\n\n\nIt encompasses a number of important elements: a genuine search for\nconsensus; accommodation of alternative views, so long as they are reasonable\nand not extremist; harvesting the ideas of as many people as possible, right\ndown to the grassroots level; and keeping in close touch with the common man\nto hear his views.\n\n\nSo in this context, " style " is not the opposite of\n" substance ".\n\n\nIt is not abstract either because it affects the lives of\nSingaporeans in a concrete and practical way - for instance, in deciding the\nkind of parks they want in their neighbourhoods.\n\n\nWhat Mr Goh proposes is a grassroots democracy, no less - a big\ncompliment to the political maturity of the Singapore population. \n\n\n\n What are the alternatives?\n\n\nAs far as Mr Goh is concerned, a  weak signal  from\nthe electorate must mean that the majority of Singaporeans are not exactly\nenamoured of his new political culture.\n\n\nWill it also mean that the old style is still favoured - the one\nwhich says: I have your mandate, so I will govern the way I think best?\n\n\nIt will be difficult to say.\n\n\nTo be sure, this latter approach has it merits - and its supporters.\n\n\nBut Singaporeans, as a people, must choose which approach they prefer\nand be unambiguous about it.\n\n\nAt stake is their future and their children\'s future - and the way\nthat future will be shaped. \n\n\n\n As for Mr Chiam, he would like Singaporeans to believe that they can have\ntheir cake and eat it too - by giving a mandate to the Prime Minister and\nvoting in more opposition members.\n\n\nBut Mr Goh, who has proven to be a far more canny politician than\nmany have given him credit for, has scotched this idea and forced the\nfence-sitters to choose.\n\n\nTheir choice would have been more difficult if the opposition had\nfielded a better slate of candidates.\n\n\nSadly, the crop this time is only marginally better than in previous\nelections.\n\n\nMost are the same old tired faces.\n\n\nThis is sad because aside from questions of style and culture,\nSingapore\'s political system must have room for more opposition -\n good  opposition. \n\n\nSo voters face a dilemma only if they are presented with worthy\nopposition candidates.\n\n\nAs this is hardly the case in the majority of contested wards, and\nthe PAP has the better candidates in any case, the choice is a clear one.\n\n\nMr Goh deserves a decisive mandate - 65 per cent at least - and\nSingaporeans should give him one today.\n\n\nIf they do, they will be in good hands well into the next century.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c96bc6a5-ba53-494f-afd4-f31f03fbd5f4', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.849733+00:00', 'english_score': 0.982144832611084, 'non_english_score': 0.017855167388916016}
{'text': 'Sui awoke when she heard King\'s crow.\n\n\nShe ruffled her feathers to shake off the last bits of sleep, glanced\nat Cheek\'s nest and tucked her head under her left wing, away from the early\nmorning insects, for that one last warm residual wink that she enjoyed the\nmost before another day in the kampung.\n\n\nKing crowed again.\n\n\nSuch a majestic call!\n\n\n" I am the King of the World!" he said with that Cock-coor-a-coorrrr!\n\n\n" I am the King of the WOIt was a sound to awaken the world,\nwhich slept when he slept and awoke when he called.\n\n\nSui could imagine him now, standing on the lip of the well, holding\nfirm on that slippery surface with the sure grip of his giant claws that\ncould easily rip the eyes out of his enemies, greeting as mighty a God as the\nSun with his own bright eye and loud, clear voice.\n\n\nCock-coor-a-coorrrr!\n\n\n" I am the King of the WO\n\n\nAnd he was also father to her children.\n\n\nFather to the few who slept under her body for warmth.\n\n\nKIng was also the undisputed father to the children who were in her\nbody right now, whom she was due to release into the world, safe in their\nprotective shells, any day now.\n\n\nThey would be, hopefully, what her elder sister Cheek called " those\nwith long memories".\n\n\nSui smiled under the warm darkness of her wing, remembering.\n\n\nCheek had once told Sui there were only two types of animals on the\nfarm.\n\n\nThere were those with short memories and there were those with long\nmemories.\n\n\nThose with short memories deserved no respect but they were happier.\n\n\nThey included most of the hens, all of the ducks, all three cows and\ncertainly all of the pigs.\n\n\nThose with long memories included Cheek herself, both the dogs and\nsome of the hens.\n\n\n" And which am I?" Sui had asked.\n\n\nCheek had laughed abundantly at that and said, " If you have to ask,\nSui, you are a Short Memory!" And Cheek had also said - Cheek...\n\n\nSui pulled her head sharply out from under her wing.\n\n\nThe last bits of sleep fell off Sui like the fluff from the chicken\ncoop.\n\n\nShe stared at Cheek\'s nest.\n\n\nCheek was gone.\n\n\nOh no.\n\n\nSui shot up to look around.\n\n\nHer chicks started whining immediately as they always did at the\nslightest thing.\n\n\n" Cold!\n\n\nCold!" they cheeped.\n\n\nSui sat down again quickly to keep them warm.\n\n\nCheek was not in the shed.\n\n\nWhere was Cheek?\n\n\nSui had a bad feeling.\n\n\nYesterday, Cheek had been chased by the owner\'s children, until the\nyoungest boy had caught her roughly.\n\n\nSui\'s heart fluttered with a damning fear at the remembrance.\n\n\nThe young boy, scurvy in character and rude as his shorts, had held\nCheek upside down, her head hanging to the earth, her legs firmly in his\ngrip.\n\n\nWhat had unnerved Sui was the lack of fight in Cheek after she was\ncaught.\n\n\nShe had seemed limp in spirit, a sight that had struck Sui with the\nshock of the familiar turned strange.\n\n\nCheek, like King, had always meant strength to Sui.\n\n\nShe feared the worst.\n\n\nThere were malicious rumours about a disappearance of a hen long\nbefore Sui had been born.\n\n\nIt was Cheek herself who had always cut short without ceremony\nanybody she caught discussing these rumours and since there had not been a\ndisappearance of any hen since Sui had been born - only eggs - Su had\naccepted Cheek\'s dismissal that they were only superstitious mutterings.\n\n\nAnd when Sui had asked why the owners collected the eggs, Cheek would\nonly say, " They have gone to a better place.\n\n\n" Sui knew better.\n\n\nThe owners frequently exchanged the eggs with other such owners from\nother kampungs for sundry things.\n\n\nNo doubt the other owners had these eggs hatched to grow their own\nchickens.\n\n\nCheek had been returned to the coop yesterday.\n\n\nHer humour had been brittle, but who would not be after such rough\nhandling?\n\n\n" Nothing that matters!" Cheek had said when Sui asked what happened.\n\n\n" Just a game," she said when Sui persisted.\n\n\nAnd now Cheek was gone.\n\n\nIf she was not here when Sui awoke, she could not be anywhere that\nSui knew.\n\n\nCheek never went anywhere without Sui.\n\n\nThey never breathed air further than sight of each other.\n\n\nThen where was Cheek?\n\n\nSui began to feel faint.\n\n\nSomething horrible, something bad must have happened to her.\n\n\n" Children!\n\n\nStay!" she commanded as she hopped out of the nest, onto the muddy\nfloor.\n\n\nShe slipped, but found her feet and dashed out of the small chicken\nshed, ignoring the loud, shrill cries of her chicks as they screamed, " Cold!\n\n\nCold!\n\n\nCold!"\n\n\nSui ran straight to King, who still stood on the lip of the well.\n\n\n" Lord, Cheek is missing!\n\n\nCheek is missing!" KIng looked down at Sui with an imperious eye.\n\n\nThere was the familiar cock of the head and Sui waited for that\nprecious moment that King offered to the Wind God before he spoke.\n\n\n" Cheek?" That was all he said.\n\n\nSui waited for more but there was no more coming.\n\n\n" Lord, Cheek is missing!\n\n\nYou must do something!\n\n\nShe is gone!\n\n\nCheek is gone!"\n\n\n" Be QUIET!" Sui was shocked at the fierceness of his reply.\n\n\nWhat had she done to deserve this?\n\n\nCheek was missing!\n\n\nDidn\'t he want to know?\n\n\nWhat was he going to do about it?\n\n\n" Lord - " Sui began.\n\n\n" I said BE QUIET!" Sui looked at him appalled.\n\n\nWhat was going on?\n\n\n" Your children cry for you.\n\n\nThey are tearing their voices out of their lungs.\n\n\nIs your reply to cast them to the cold?\n\n\nWhat must you do now?\n\n\nWhat is it you must do?" Sui\'s eyes turned to iron weights, pulling\nher head down.\n\n\n" I must return to my children."\n\n\n" I will say no more."\n\n\nSui raised her eyes from the ground without any idea of how she dared\nto do it and looked hard into King\'s eyes.\n\n\nThey were as cold as the deep of the First Well.\n\n\nBut there was something else in them too.\n\n\nSomething she had never seen before and could not recognise.\n\n\nIt spurred a horrifying thought.\n\n\nHad King something to do with Cheek\'s disappearance?\n\n\nWas that it?\n\n\nHad KIng done something to Cheek?\n\n\nHe had a temper like the roar of the earth-shaking machines that came\nand went on the farm.\n\n\nHad he ripped her chest apart with those terrible claws for a word\nspoken without care?\n\n\nWhat had King done to Cheek?\n\n\nWhat right had he to hurt her; she was so gentle that Sui\'s own\nchildren called her Mother.\n\n\nSui turned and took uncertain steps back towards the chicken shed,\nher world suddenly just earth that was shifting under her feet.\n\n\nCheek gone.\n\n\nAnd King had something to do with it.\n\n\nSui hated King that moment with a fury that made a mockery of all\nher senses.\n\n\nShe thought she would go mad.\n\n\n" SUI!"\n\n\nShe turned sharply.\n\n\nIt was King.\n\n\n" Where are you going?\n\n\nI said return to your children!" Sui realised then that she had been\nwandering off on a confused tack.\n\n\nSuddenly hot blood filled her head with a rage that was white light.\n\n\nShe screamed and ran towards King in a killing rage." All the noise\nof the kampung stilled in shock and awe of that sight.\n\n\nSui, the loyal hen, was taking on KIng.\n\n\nKIng jumped down from the rock and confronted Sui squarely as she\nrushed blindly towards him.\n\n\nHis feelings were mixed with compassion and an involuntary rage that\nwas swelling up within him.\n\n\nAfter all, a hen.\n\n\nHow dare she act this way?\n\n\nAs she rushed up to him, he tensed his legs and lunged, checking her\nwith a body blow.\n\n\nSui fell - flew - backwards from the impact and fell heavily on her\nside, every bit of breath smashed out of her body.\n\n\nKing\'s blow had been harder and more brutal than he had intended.\n\n\nHe had lost control.\n\n\nAnd that only made him angrier.\n\n\nNo matter what, she had no right to act this way!\n\n\nNo matter what, a hen.\n\n\nAnd she had made him lose control over himself in front of the\nentire farm.\n\n\nIN FRONT of the ENTIRE farm!\n\n\nKIng turned and strutted away abruptly.\n\n\nHe walked past the perimeter of the farm and out of sight behind the\ntobacco plot.\n\n\nTowards the other farmer\'s plot.\n\n\nFew dared to go in that direction.\n\n\nEven King seldom did it without an audience.\n\n\nToday he did it alone.\n\n\nWith KIng gone, the other hens came running to Sui, who still lay on\nthe ground in a daze, her feathers heavy with mud from the wet ground.\n\n\nFirst to reach her was none other than Kai, who was the second wife\nof King and the self-styled matriarch of the group after King\'s first wife\nhad been crushed into the ground by one of the earth-shaking machines.\n\n\nIt was said of Kai that she had a heart like clean water; it was\nhard to find around here and held no harm.\n\n\nWithout a word, Kai began nudging Sui back on her feet, using her\nbeak to push under Sui\'s heavy body, never mind the wet dirt.\n\n\nSui got up unsteadily and found herself surrounded by nine clucking,\nfat hens.\n\n\nNot all of them had run to help.\n\n\nTwo of them, their ample flesh quivering with delight at her\npredicament, were already chiding her loud enough for the whole kampung to\nhear.\n\n\n" How can?\n\n\nHow can?"

"\n\n\nSui!\n\n\nCalm yourself!" Even as Madog said it, she cast a worried look\ntowards her male partner on the porch of the house.\n\n\nHe had got up off his belly and was watching intently for any more\nsigns of trouble.\n\n\nDog - who was younger than Madog, lean, handsome and alert - had\nbeen caught off guard by the little scene earlier, and he didn\'t intend to\nlet things get out of hand again. \n\n\nMadog quickly set her tail wagging to reassure him.\n\n\nShe talked to Sui as if in a light-hearted way to show that\neverything was all right.\n\n\nBut the words that fell rapidly from Madog\'s mouth were anything\nbut frivolous.\n\n\n" Sui, if you calm down enough to listen to me, I will tell you\neverything, but first you must go behind the cow shed.\n\n\nDo you understand?\n\n\nSui, do you understand me?\n\n\nSui, you must calm down!\n\n\nYou must.\n\n\nThere is danger for you if you don\'t."', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '08a6992a-98a8-4096-a16d-f21a6b5d8d72', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.850890+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9953829050064087, 'non_english_score': 0.004617094993591309}
{'text': 'GENTLY APART \n\n\nIN THE sultry silence of the hot June afternoon, Ah Hua knelt before\nthe ornately decorated altar and bowed in solemn reverence, nine glowing\njoss-sticks held between her palms.\n\n\nA fish offering of oranges and peaches sat beside the image of\nGuanyin, the Chinese Goddess of Mercy.\n\n\nAh Hua straightened and planted three of the joss-sticks into a\nporcelain urn which already held the remaining red wooden leads of previous\nofferings.\n\n\nWith a grunt, she stood up and, bowing piously to the deity, she\nretreated and moved to the front door where she placed three of the six\nsticks into a small joss-stick holder at the upper edge of the door for the\nLord of the Sky and the rest at the lower edge for the Grandfather Soil.\n\n\nAh Hua had great dreams.\n\n\nShe had always been the \'slightly crazy one\' in the family, dreaming\nof all the wonderful things which no one in the entire village even dared\nimagine.\n\n\nShe had been eager to achieve, to learn and to prove herself, if not\nanybody else.\n\n\nShe wanted to be somebody, someone who had accomplishments to be proud\nof, someone who could look back on her life and see that some meaning had\nbeen woven into what would otherwise have been a long boring routine.\n\n\nTwenty-seven years in the conservative world of the Chinese\ncommunists did little to curb her youthful enthusiasm.\n\n\nShe had arrived, a naive young woman with childish long plaits and\nadorned in a drab blue suit so characteristic of the Maoist reign but her\nheart had been filled with hopeful eagerness.\n\n\nThe next twenty-seven years had gradually killed her dreams,\nstrangling them with an eternal cord of hungry, boisterous children, an ever\nincreasing load of dirty clothing, the deary soaping and sudding of oily\nplates and bowls, and those hot tiring hours sweating before the blackened\ncharcoal stove, cooking for the workers in her husband\'s tinsmith shop.\n\n\nAs a child, she had been filled with fickle-minded ambitions.\n\n\nA singer, a teacher, an opera-performer, an artist, a writer, a\ncalligrapher - these had all been a part of her many ideals at one time or\nanother.\n\n\nNow, all she was and would ever be was a grumpy, disillusioned,\nboring housewife without a mind of her own, always slaving only to do some\ntasks set for her by others.\n\n\nShe hated it.\n\n\nHow she envied those women who had a career, some sort of direction,\ngoals to wake up to every morning.\n\n\nWhat did she have?\n\n\nA small untidy shop-house ridden with hideous cockroaches and rats,\ngrown children who never bothered to visit, and a husband who followed the\nmost boring schedule in the world.\n\n\nShe wanted some achievement which she could call her own.\n\n\nShe wondered if she was doomed to fighting fate and losing - every\ntime!\n\n\nHer husband had worked as a tinsmith even before they were married;\nhe had been apprenticed to the village tinsmith back in their village in\nGuangdong when he was only eight; that was his only expertise, but at least\nhe had an expertise, something he knew and could be proud of, a craft that he\nwas thoroughly familiar with.\n\n\nAfter all those years, he still had a passionate, defensive loyalty\ntowards his trade.\n\n\nAll those years, through the Depression, the entire Japanese\nOccupation, the riots and unrest of the fifties, he had got up at six,\nfollowed the same routine of food, work and hour of puffing at his enormous\npipe before retiring to bed.\n\n\nShe remembered time when he, too, had seemed to have the same\nbeautiful ideals as she had.\n\n\nYes, there had been a time when he had even bought a calculator to\nkeep a tab on his bills and receipts instead of using abacus.\n\n\nThere was a time when he had supported her fight against sexual\ndiscrimination; there was a time when he had agreed with her that Western\ncapitalism did not only mean greed but also progress, a desire to improve\nliving standards.\n\n\nThose times had vanished.\n\n\nThose times were so dim that it seemed as though they never existed.\n\n\nSlowly, he had settled down to a dull existence, making an honest\nliving from honest hours of hard work.\n\n\nHe stopped talking about moving up in society, or getting a better,\nmore hygienic apartment at one of those impressive new housing estates built\nby the government.\n\n\nTheir shop-house, forlorn and weary, stood squeezed among other\nequally pathetic looking structures, all crying for a coat of paint.\n\n\nThe floor of wooden planks rattled and complained at the slightest\nprovocation, and the tap, rusty and corroded, screeched like a gleeful wicked\nwitch when turned on.\n\n\nHe had been a little irritated when she tried to persuade him to get\nthe tap fixed.\n\n\n" We should be grateful we have a tap," he said.\n\n\n" In China, don\'t you remember, we don\'t get fresh water this easily?\n\n\nDon\'t you remember how we had to carry every drop from the well?\n\n\nNow we have a tap, so we really should not complain." He had a\nneutral way of speaking which was perhaps one reason why they never had a\nquarrel although she felt sometimes that he could be most exasperating.\n\n\nHe was never forceful in his speech and hence, never offensive.\n\n\nThis is not China, she had wanted to scream in frustration but of\ncourse, she did not.\n\n\nFor all his passiveness and lack of the aggressive drive which\nirritated her, he was still her husband and she did not believe in\nhenpecking.\n\n\nChina was a land they had left behind forever when they had stepped\nonto the unsteady overloaded junk in search of a better life.\n\n\nChina should be just a hazy memory of simple peasants who worked only\nto fill their stomachs and stored enough food to last through winter.\n\n\nHere was the new life they had sought, but still, he held on tightly\nto the surreal images of his old backward motherland; he was simply too\nafraid to let those familiar feelings of home die.\n\n\nNow, everyone had fashionable taps.\n\n\nEveryone was obsessively conscious of cleanliness and hygiene, and\nyet, he would calmly point out that they fortunate because they had a toilet\nthat flushed instead of having a night-soil collector visit them daily.\n\n\nHe was a good provider, she admitted, but his perspectives were all\nwrong.\n\n\nHe just could not accept the fact that they were not in the old land,\nthat their world should now belong to that of this ambitious island on which\nthey had indeed advanced a long way, indulging in luxuries which would never\nhave been possible in their homeland.\n\n\nIn his eyes, they were not hanging on to the lowest rung of the\nladder, the large group of illiterate, ignorant immigrants who slaved as\nlabourers in this land of promise and opportunity.\n\n\nIt was like telling themselves a little lie to justify inertia where\nenthusiasm and ambition should have been; it was like imagining that they had\nimproved tremendously when in truth, they had only taken a tiny steps already\nachieved by others.\n\n\nShe wanted a fight.\n\n\nShe wanted to scream out the frustration festering inside.\n\n\nPerhaps yelling and screeching like a lunatic would help release the\nbitterness and disappointment choking her life.\n\n\nThose wasted hours, those precious seconds, caught in a web of\ndrudgery when she could have done something, accomplished something\nmeaningful.\n\n\nThey never had a fight before.\n\n\nPerhaps it was time to start one.\n\n\nShe felt she could remain dormant no longer.\n\n\nShe bowed deeply from habit even as these angry thoughts ran through\nhe mind.\n\n\nHer husband had never been unfaithful and she wondered if she was\nquite out of her mind, for now she actually wanted him to be.\n\n\nThat, she thought, should add some excitement, some unpredictability\ninto their lives.\n\n\nShe glanced up at the huge dark clock on the wall.\n\n\nIt was one minute to four.\n\n\nShe removed two char siew buns, which were hot and deliciously soft,\nfrom the steamer and placed them on a chipped yellowed plate.\n\n\nThen regular as clockwork, her husband appeared at the door, wiping\nbeads of perspiration from his heads, a rolled up Chinese newspaper tucked\nunder his right arm.\n\n\nHe was a stocky man, balding slightly at the temple; he had enormous\nstaring eyes below his bushy eyebrows and showed carelessly arranged\ntobacco-stained teeth when he smiled; his pot belly, the result of years of\npork lard and beer, heaved as he walked.\n\n\nHe sat down, unfolded the newspaper and spread it on the table,\npartly touching the fresh buns.\n\n\nThen he flapped one corner, took a bun which now bore several black\nsmears from the newspaper print, and ate contentedly.\n\n\n" Look at that," she sighed loudly.\n\n\n" Just look at that!\n\n\nYou have made the buns all dirty.\n\n\nDon\'t you know the ink is poisonous?\n\n\nCan\'t you be more careful?\n\n\nOne of these days, you are going to die of poisoning, and then you\nwill be sorry, but it will be too late.\n\n\nYes, too late." She closed the lid of the pot with a loud clanging.\n\n\nHe looked up in surprise.\n\n\n" Huh?" " How is it that you never listen to me when I speak?\n\n\nYou never hear a word I say.\n\n\nMy words just blow pass your ears like the wind.\n\n\nYes, like the wind." She threw the ladle into the sink.\n\n\nA fight was starting up very nicely.\n\n\nUnperturbed, he sent his teeth into the freshly steamed dough and the\ntasty meat filling, his eyes on her, puzzled and a little surprised.\n\n\n" This tastes very good." " Can\'t you speak?\n\n\nAll you do when you come home is eat and sleep.\n\n\nYes, eat and sleep.\n\n\nThat is all you know how to do.\n\n\nWhy don\'t we talk any more?\n\n\nWhy am I the only one dreaming our big dreams now?" She gritted her\nteeth as she watched him slowly fold the newspaper back into a neat tube.\n\n\n" What are you talking about?\n\n\nWhat have char siew buns got to do with dreams?\n\n\nWhat are you talking about?" He rubbed his nose from which flared\nseveral long strands of hair.\n\n\n" One moment you are telling me to stop eating ink and then you\nsuddenly bring up dreams.\n\n\nWhat is the matter?" His voice was patient, as always.\n\n\n" Our big dreams!\n\n\nOur big dreams!\n\n\nYou used to have them too, remember?\n\n\nWe used to work for them together.\n\n\nWhy am I alone now?\n\n\nWhen we were in China, you had great ambitions.\n\n\nYou wanted to make a lots of money, you wanted to - " She stopped,\nexhausted and feeling that her efforts at sparking off a fire were futile.\n\n\n" Aren\'t you happy?" His face was calm and placid.\n\n\n" Damn it, I am not talking about happiness.\n\n\nI\'m talking about the dreams that you have given up chasing," she\nseethed.\n\n\n" Why are you always so angry, so frustrated?" He took another bite\nand chewed rapidly.\n\n\n" What is it that will make you happy?\n\n\nWill just dreaming and chasing dreams make you happy?\n\n\nHaven\'t we got all the clothes and food we need?" " Dreaming will\nnot make me happy," she cried.\n\n\n" It is dying dreams that is making me so mad and unhappy.\n\n\nI am not discontented with what we have - if this is the best we can\nmanage.\n\n\nWe could do better.\n\n\nA million times better." Yes, she was angry.\n\n\nYes she was frustrated.\n\n\nHer hopes, he ambitions, were now gradually drifting away.\n\n\nShe was angry because she was fifty-four and still as far from her\ngoal as she had been years ago.\n\n\nShe was only a housewife.\n\n\nShe hated being cooped up like the hens on the farm back home.\n\n\nWhere was the freedom that migration to this free land promised?\n\n\nShe felt deflated and suddenly, she wanted to cry.\n\n\nTears filled her eyes and overflowed into streamlets down her\ncheeks.\n\n\nA whole life wasted.\n\n\nHer whole life wasted.\n\n\nThen she felt his hands on the shoulder. \n\n\nThey seldom touched.\n\n\nFor a long time, the comfort of touching had been forgotten.\n\n\nShe gave a involuntary shudder and leaned against him, feeling\nsecure as his calloused hands tightened her.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '6ae67639-3a95-4895-b05b-322e37b94bc7', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.852422+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9927017688751221, 'non_english_score': 0.00729823112487793}
{'text': 'A Drop of Blood \n\n\nIT WAS almost ten in the morning and Raymond Wong was already locked\nup in his cramped two room Housing Development Board ( HDB) flat, revising a\nShakespearean play \'Macbeth\' for the afternoon literature paper.\n\n\nAlready, he was cramming as much as his tired mind could absorb\ndespite the Cantonese soap opera from the next door\'s Rediffusion box\nblasting against Macbeth\'s attempt on Duncan\'s life in Act Two, Scene Two.\n\n\nFrustrated, he closed the book and threw it against the wall.\n\n\n" Inconsiderate pigs!" he muttered, turning around and staring at the\nbook lying on the floor.\n\n\nFor many times, he had wondered why he had allowed himself to apply\nfor annual leave and be tormented under the immense pressure of the General\nCertificate Examination ( GCE) \'A\' level exams.\n\n\nHe hated studying.\n\n\nBut as his superior officer once said to him, " Wong, if you are to\nclimb the ladder it would be better to have a \'A\' level cert.\n\n\nOtherwise, you might remain as a detective for the rest of your career\nin the force.\n\n\nPaper qualification is important in Singapore."\n\n\nYes, a paper qualification would help ...a lot.\n\n\nReluctantly, he bent down trying to reach for the book, when the door\nbell chimed.\n\n\nStanding up, he pulled his crumbled loose pyjamas pants higher and\nopened the door.\n\n\nA five year old Malay boy, Ismail bin Mohammad, was standing there\nwith his arms behind his back.\n\n\n" Yah, Ismail?" The timid Malay boy quickly revealed his right arm,\nclutching a letter.\n\n\n" Encik, aunty ask me to give you this.\n\n\nPostman just came."\n\n\n" Okay, where\'s aunty?"\n\n\n" Market, buy food."\n\n\nWith that, he dashed along the corridor and down the stairs.\n\n\nRaymond closed the door, remarking to himself that he was never good\nwith children.\n\n\nSomehow, they always feared him.\n\n\nMaybe, because he was a Mata-Mata ( Policeman).\n\n\nOn the way to the bedroom, he tore open the brown envelope.\n\n\nOn the face was his scrawny written address:\n\n\nRaymond Wong\n\n\nBlk 701, 134V\n\n\nSingapore 0316\n\n\nSlumped onto his favourite Malacca cane chair, he pulled out the\nsheet of paper.\n\n\nOnly a drop of blood, or so it seemed, was easy to notice.\n\n\nIt was the size of a five cents coin, and was placed or dipped\nprominently in the centre.\n\n\nBut it did not interest Raymond Wong.\n\n\nThinking that it was one of those pranks played by the neighbourhood\nchildren, he tore it up.\n\n\nAfter all, children never liked him.\n\n\nThat night, his wife brought up a letter.\n\n\nIt was a similar brown letter with the scrawny written address.\n\n\nIn it, the content was similar too, if not, the same.\n\n\nA drop of blood.\n\n\nRaymond pondered over the matter and began to wonder about the person\nwho was so willing to spare his blood over a plain wordless sheet of paper.\n\n\nA practical joker?\n\n\nOr one of his colleagues who was trying to humour him with \'study\nwith blood and sweat\'?\n\n\nCould this be a woman?\n\n\nOr an ex-criminal seeking revenge?\n\n\nNot wanting to worry, he quickly stuffed the letter into his trousers\npocket.\n\n\nNonchalantly, he returned to his chair and started reading his\nhistory book.\n\n\nHe tried to study but his mind halted every time and he thought to\nsubmit himself into thinking of the letter.\n\n\nHe knew he would do badly for the history paper.\n\n\nImmediately after taking the history paper, which he did not do well\nat all, Raymond, a now worried man, went back to his office.\n\n\nFirstly, he was worried about the possible threat against him or his\nlone treasure, his wife.\n\n\nSecondly, he wondered what the response from his colleagues would be.\n\n\nHopefully, they would not laugh at him: a fully trained detective\nfrightened by a possible childish prank.\n\n\nNo one laughed.\n\n\nOn the contrary, much interest was expressed in the alleged threat,\nespecially on the letter which Raymond had brought along.\n\n\nThe Officer in Charge of the Detective Office, Inspector Tan,\nremarked that the letter was probably sent by someone who had a grudge\nagainst Raymond.\n\n\n" Me?" asked Raymond incredulously.\n\n\nHe had every right to be.\n\n\nFor the past few years, he had been handling only minor cases ranging\nfrom shoplifting to stolen vehicles.\n\n\nNothing of that would warrant a threat.\n\n\n" I\'II tell you what, Ray.\n\n\nFirst, I can send this to our lab for analysis and I will inform the\nstation to intensify patrol around your area.\n\n\nOther than that, there is nothing more we can do for the moment,"\nInspector Tan said.\n\n\n" And stay at home more often, huh.\n\n\nWe know what to do.\n\n\nAnd you know our regular advice: see anything suspicious, call us,\nall right?" his colleagues assured him.\n\n\nFeeling comforted, Raymond went home.\n\n\nAt least his friends were doing something.\n\n\nNow, all he had to do was to wait for the laboratory test result and\nstay at home more often.\n\n\nIt was true that he had not handled a major case since two years ago.\n\n\nDriving on his way back he was unconsciously thinking of the letter.\n\n\nThe more he dwelled on the subject, the more logic could initiate\nthat it was nothing more than a harmless prank.\n\n\nStop worrying, he told himself.\n\n\nPutting on a forced smile and whistling an off beat tune, he tried to\nconcentrate on the driving instead.\n\n\nHe reached home just as the telephone rang.\n\n\nOpening the door, he was surprised to find nobody at home.\n\n\nYet he shouted, " Mei!\n\n\nTelephone!" No answer.\n\n\nWhen the phone shrilled for the third time, Ray snatched the hand\npiece and muttered a curse.\n\n\n" Yah!" " Raymond?\n\n\nThis is Tan, we just got the lab result." It was his\nOfficer-in-Charge.\n\n\n" So fast?"\n\n\n" Yes, we gave you priority.\n\n\nLab result could not reveal any finger prints ...\n\n\nBut here is the good news.\n\n\nThat blood on the paper consists nothing but water colour paint."\nRaymond broke into relief laughter.\n\n\n" Nice to hear that, huh?\n\n\nAnyway, it seems to he a harmless threat so I am putting this matter\non KIV ( keep in view), but you will still have extra patrols around your\narea.\n\n\nVery Important Person treatment, you know," Inspector Tan laughed.\n\n\n" Hey, thanks.\n\n\nSure appreciate it!" From that moment on, Raymond felt reassured.\n\n\nA little child\'s prank?\n\n\nHe broke into laughter again.\n\n\nPutting his thoughts away, he resumed studying.\n\n\nOnly this time, he did so with full concentration power.\n\n\nThis time he was going to score in his Ceneral Paper and Economics.\n\n\nA wave of confidence swept through him.\n\n\nSeveral days passed and Raymond had made it a point to look into the\npost box regularly.\n\n\nThey were only bills and the usual junk mail.\n\n\nNothing else.\n\n\nHis fear, by this time, had almost disappeared, so much so, that he\ninformed his station, the Queenstown Police Station, also known as \'D\'\nDivision, to close the case.\n\n\nBut still, he did notice that there were more foot patrols around\nhis block of flats.\n\n\nAnd when he looked into the opposite block, he was shocked to see a\nperson standing at the corridor of the same level, staring into his dining\nhall.\n\n\nA wave of cold chill shot up.\n\n\nRaymond observed clearly and, after quite some time, to his relief,\ndiscovered that the man was his colleague, a plain clothes detective.\n\n\nReal kind of inspector, Raymond thought, and mental note to thank\nhim personally for the assistance.\n\n\nThe sight of the plain clothes policeman brought Raymond some peace\nand a feeling of foolishness.\n\n\nNo doubt, he had never felt safer in his own home but yet he was\nembarrassed to have troubled his friends.\n\n\nSeveral times a day, he would look into the opposite flat to confirm\nthe detective \'s presence.\n\n\nHe was still there.\n\n\nIt was coming to the end of the examination period and Raymond felt\nrelaxed.\n\n\nHis last paper was Chinese Language and there was nothing much to\nstudy for.\n\n\nSettled onto his favourite chair he started reading the newspaper.\n\n\nIt was Tuesday and it had been quite some time since he had a chance\nto read the morning paper peacefully now that the letter incident was dying\noff, and his wife out for facial treatment.\n\n\nSurprisingly, there was no noise from his neighbours, no kids\nscreaming along the corridor and, of course, no prank letters.\n\n\nOnly the passing of the morning traffic provided the disturbance he\nhad been used to.\n\n\nAs he read the paper, he was contemplating on how he should spend\nhis last two days of his leave.\n\n\nMovies?\n\n\nFishing orjust plain sleeping?\n\n\nHe was really enjoying the thoughts when the door bell chimed.\n\n\nHis wife?\n\n\nHe stood up, stretched himself and strode to the door.\n\n\nExpecting to see his wife or neighbour, he was surprised to see a\ntall Indian man dressed in light green shirt and dark green trousers.\n\n\nThe postman.\n\n\n" Yes?\'\n\n\n" Hello, I have a registered letter for Mr Raymond Wong.\n\n\nYou Raymond Wong?" His breath, filled with cigar smell, forced\nRaymond to totter a few steps backward.\n\n\n" Yes, yes, yes.\n\n\nLet me sign the paper." His hand quickly snatched the counterfoil\nand he signed it.\n\n\nUnlike the usual green slip, this copy was in light brown.\n\n\nRay commented on it and the postman quickly replied that this was\nthe new set of counterfoil.\n\n\n" Here you are."\n\n\n" Thanks, by the way, could I use your toilet?"\n\n\nRaymond smiled and with his warm hospitality directed him to the\ntoilet.\n\n\nWhile waiting for the postman, Raymond looked at the letters that\nthe postman had brought up for him as well.\n\n\nWell, there were the usual Reader\'s Digest bill, Public Utilities\nBoard bill, the registered letter from the Inland Revenue Department, then\nsomething struck him.\n\n\nIt was the letter from Reader\'s Digest.\n\n\nThere was a ten-cent stamp on it but it was not stamped by the post\noffice.\n\n\nEven the registered letter had his name and address on a label\nunlike the normal procedure which was on the envelope.\n\n\nNot really knowing what to do, he tore open the envelope.\n\n\nAnd there it was: a sheet of white paper.\n\n\nAnd a drop of blood.\n\n\n" It is going to be your blood." The voice startled him as Raymond\nturned around.\n\n\nHe gave a soft scream when he saw a gleaming kitchen knife and fell\nback onto the sofa.\n\n\nThe sudden chill pierced sharply into his abdomen as he uttered.\n\n\n" Who are you!" The Indian smiled, revealing his thick wet lips.\n\n\nIt was a smile that announced death.\n\n\n" You don\'t know me.\n\n\nThink, Wong, six years ago.\n\n\nThe Redhill Murder?" Ray\'s mind raced back six years ago.\n\n\nOne late evening a young 18-year old girl was found molested and\nmurdered in a slightly deserted car park.\n\n\nA dagger was found stabbed into her stomach.\n\n\nTen minutes earlier, a robbery was committed near this vicinity.\n\n\nThis time, there were witnesses.\n\n\nThe victim, an old man, identified the Indian during the\nidentification.\n\n\nThe other witness confirmed the identification.\n\n\nThe investigating officer, Detective Raymond Wong, immediately put\nhim under arrest.\n\n\nA week later, another charge of molesting and murder was served on\nhim.\n\n\n" Do you recall now?\n\n\nI was sentenced to six years imprisonment and not the death sentence\nbecause you could not put up a credible case.\n\n\nYes, I did commit the robbery.\n\n\nBut I never did kill that girl.\n\n\nYou wanted results, fast results and never bothered the life of an\ninnocent man.\n\n\nYou tried to kill me!"\n\n\n" No, no, listen, please.\n\n\nYes, it was my fault.\n\n\nI sort of got carried away, you know, the promotion and so on.\n\n\nI made a dumb mistake.\n\n\nPlease forgive me, I have a wife and maybe a child soon."

{'text': 'HOMECOMING \n\n\nThere was a tap at the window; a pair of glasses was visible between\nthe panes.\n\n\nHe got up and went to the window.\n\n\nThe man who stood outside was about forty, with a smooth clear skin\nand a slight paunch - it slopped out like a deflated punching bag over the\nlow-slung belt around his waist.\n\n\n" What do you want?" he said calmly: there was a hint of an accent in\nhis voice and the man outside began to look faintly antagonistic.\n\n\n" The owner of the flat died - about a week and a half ago and the HDB\nhas taken the flat back.\n\n\nStrangers are not supposed to be walking in and out - " " I\'m his\nson," he said.\n\n\n" I\'ve just returned from England and I\'m sorting out my father\'s\nthings." The man said, " Really, ah!\n\n\nI didn\'t know he had a son.\n\n\nIn fact, didn\'t even know he was married.\n\n\nHe was so quiet, you know - " " Yes, I know," the son said softly,\nand closed the window-panes, but so gently that it hardly seemed like a snub.\n\n\nThere was a tentative tap at the window again; he ignored it and the\ntap was not repeated.\n\n\nFar below, he could hear someone\'s radio blaring out the American Top\n40, while a piano was being thumped on in the flat above.\n\n\nHe could even hear the raised voice of a mother furiously and nasally\nscolding her child in Hokkien.\n\n\nHe had forgotten about the noise, all those years away, and he\nthought for a while about how noise even sounded different in a cold climate\n- it seemed to echo more, to have a quality of being suspended in air like\nfragile crystalware, giving a sense of breathless anticipation, of not\nknowing what to expect as you rounded a corner.\n\n\nOr so he thought.\n\n\nHere, noise seemed to come from the gut of some monster in the earth.\n\n\nHe roused himself.\n\n\nHis father had slit his wrists and bled to death in his bed and he\nwanted to find a reason for it, if he could.\n\n\nThe police had said, in a shocked way, Murder?\n\n\nNot this time, and they had stared accusingly at him, as though he\nhad driven his father to suicide himself, and was now trying to cover up for\nit.\n\n\nLoneliness, they said glibly.\n\n\nThe man had lived utterly alone for five years - no relatives to\nspeak of, no wife ( ran off with a foreigner, hadn\'t she!\n\n\n- bad lot), only son studying in the wilderness of Britain.\n\n\nNo friends to speak of either - he was terribly reclusive, the\nneighbours said.\n\n\nWithdrawn.\n\n\nRetired, moreover, three years ago.\n\n\nDid nothing but stay in his flat all day, re-reading the papers and\nwaiting for the day his son would come home.\n\n\nWell, then.\n\n\nMotives, reasons galore.\n\n\nHe had wanted to shoot the whole police station to bits.\n\n\nHe stood in the middle of the sitting room and stared round - but it\nwas no use, he could get up no feelings of regret, even recognition, for the\nhome he\'d once lived in.\n\n\nHe thought the two-room flat looked terrible, with its mottled,\naquamarine walls, mottled, aquamarine furniture, and the glaring starkness of\nthose same walls and furniture.\n\n\nHe thought he remembered a faded Van Gogh print and three Chinese\nscrolls - they were gone.\n\n\nThe closet in his father\'s room contained a week\'s change of clothes,\nall grey, all unironed, the artifacts of a man who did his own washing and\nhad ceased to care what he wore.\n\n\nUnder the bed he\'d discovered a pile of magazines about China,\ndust-ridden.\n\n\nHis father, he knew, had been born in Shanghai, had fled as a boy of\neight on a boat to Hong Kong during the Second World War, then Singapore, all\nthe while taking care of a younger brother who had eventually died of\ncholera.\n\n\nIt was a spectacular immigrant\'s story - the stuff of tear-jerkers\nin the Chinese press.\n\n\nAs a child, he had always enjoyed his father\'s narration: He (\nprompting): Then what did you do, Dad, when you got to Hong Kong?\n\n\nHis father ( sighing): Aaia, I was just eight, but what a resourceful\neight!\n\n\nI sold newspapers, I shone shoes ...\n\n\nI undercharged the street price once by a cent and they pulled a\nknife on me - I ran incredible risks for that lousy cent!\n\n\nI held car doors open for the women at the Jockey Club, while dodging\nthe commissionaire.\n\n\nDo you know, I would have held those car doors open for nothing.\n\n\nI just liked looking at a world I had no part of ...\n\n\nthey wore the most marvellous dresses, I thought, particularly the\nChinese women.\n\n\nThey felt they had to keep their end up, I suppose ...\n\n\nHis father had been a romantic, an unabashed sucker for sentiment and\nnostalgia.\n\n\nEven as an adult, he would take his only son with him in the evenings\nto a small hill-rise to watch the sun set and quote half-remembered snatches\nof poetry.\n\n\nHis wife thought he was a right nutter; she said so, too.\n\n\nShe made it clear that one had the prerogative to enjoy sunsets only\nafter one had shown one could provide for the family - which he was rather\ninept in doing.\n\n\nIt wasn\'t his father\'s fault, the boy thought loyally; even then he\'d\ndisliked his mother\'s no-nonsense realism, her work ethic, her battle-cry of,\nThe Chinese are not like the others - we Chinese, we work.\n\n\n( Thinking about it now, the man was reminded of the Indians and\nPakistanis he\'d met in England who said scornfully of the English that the\nonly reason for unemployment was because the Anglo whites were afraid of\ngetting their hands dirty.) Finally, though, his mother had relieved herself\nof her two burdens - there one day, gone the next - and she had never come\nback.\n\n\nThe child had rather hoped she would; after all, she was still his\nmother and the only one of them who could cook properly - but she never had.\n\n\nHe had given up hoping after a year.\n\n\nThose magazines on China bothered him.\n\n\nHad his father been planning a trip with his CPF savings?\n\n\nHe had distant cousins there, no more.\n\n\nPerhaps life in Singapore had become increasingly remote to him, as\nhe lived alone, and only his childhood, in the so-called motherland, had been\nreal to him.\n\n\nHis father had given no inkling of the kind in his letters.\n\n\nThose dry-as-dust, factual little letters that were each a replica of\nthe ones before.\n\n\nHe had always read them after his day at the university, standing by\nthe window of the bed-sit he had rented to cut down on living expenses and\nwhich wasn\'t large enough to swing a cat in.\n\n\nHe, too, had lived alone, and within the confines of the Asian\ncommunity at the university.\n\n\nRead the letters while the Jamaicans next door played their reggae\nand got high on ganja and dreamed of the Rasta man free in his own land.\n\n\nThe letters were like whispers through the crack in his mind which\nwas the only admission he gave of the existence of his country.\n\n\nHe had, for a while, gone through a violent phase of apostasy\nregarding the political and social systems he\'d been brought up in; the other\nSingapore students, as a result, had cut him dead.\n\n\nDear son ( the letters ran, in small, beautifully formed Chinese\nscript), How are you?\n\n\nI read the London temperature in the papers today - 10 degrees\nCelsius.\n\n\nIt seems to me extremely cold.\n\n\nYou had better keep warm.\n\n\nThank you for your letter, but I don\'t want you to feel you are\nobliged to write regularly.\n\n\nYour studies are far more important, believe me.\n\n\nA scholarship student like you has far more to live up to than the\nordinary paper chaser.\n\n\nI am well, myself.\n\n\nAs you know, I have been following The Father\'s House on Channel 8;\nit is exciting stuff...\n\n\nThey told nothing and gave nothing away and their tone remained the\nsame even when the son was furiously scribbling out his spleen at the\ngovernment who had sent him overseas and allowed his father to finally\npurchase his flat only in middle age.\n\n\nIt was as though his father spoke his whimsy to some cardboard\noffspring he had stuck on a wall in his room, ignoring the real one.\n\n\nBut that was his father, of course; he had realised that, when the\nexasperation had died down.\n\n\nHis father\'s life\'s work had been to escape reality, all along.\n\n\nHe could not find any of his letters to his father, except for the\nlast one, which had been found by his bedside.\n\n\nHe was piqued at not finding any, and even hurt, for a moment - but\nhis father had kept remarkably few things.\n\n\nNo superfluous pieces of paper - no lists, no bills, no diaries, no\nbooks - only his most important documents, tied up with a rubberband.\n\n\nAs though to be able to account for his existence if ever any\nmythical Secret Police broke in.\n\n\nNo photographs, the son realised.\n\n\nNo badly taken shots of him as a child, smirking horribly in various\nplaces of interest, no wedding snaps with everybody standing around trying to\nlook as if they were enjoying themselves.\n\n\nNo record of a life anywhere.\n\n\nHe thought his father must have been trying to whittle himself out of\nmemory and mind.\n\n\nParing himself down to nothing.\n\n\nHe knew, now, why the police were so certain his father had committed\nsuicide, despite the absence of a suicide note.\n\n\nHow could you cry for a man who wanted so desperately to be\nforgotten!\n\n\nHe had never known his father.\n\n\nThat sounded trite - after all, very few people did; their fathers\nwere figures in the background, sources of funds, reproaches and unwanted\nadvice.\n\n\nBut his father hadn\'t even been that.\n\n\nHe had always been shadowy and towards the end of his life he had\nstepped into the dark altogether and there was no spotlight strong enough to\nreclaim him.\n\n\nFor a moment, he was angry.\n\n\nHe had liked those photographs, dammit, they were a part of the life\nhe had left.\n\n\nHe hated coming back to find a robbed and empty mausoleum.\n\n\nHis father had had no right -\n\n\nGoing into his old room, he flung himself on his bed, staring at the\nceiling.\n\n\nHis father had left his things alone at least - the book prizes he\'d\nwon at school and never read, his track medals, other schoolboy bits and\npieces.\n\n\nThey revolted him now; everything in the flat revolted him and when\nhe thought of the packet of sugar and tin of beans he\'d found in the kitchen,\nnothing else, he wanted to throw up.\n\n\nWar rations!\n\n\nWhat did his father do with the sugar?\n\n\nLick it!\n\n\nFeed it to ants!\n\n\nCrunch it with his toes!\n\n\nAnd again the senselessness of his father\'s life and suicide struck\nhim.\n\n\nOkay, so his father hadn\'t wanted to live, had nothing to live for.\n\n\nA son whom he hadn\'t seen for five years - the scholarship money\ndidn\'t cover vacations - was nothing to live for and so he had left this life\nas quietly as he had lived it.\n\n\nHe wanted to shout, Murderer, and, What have you left me to live for\nnow?\n\n\nHe had wanted to come back, triumphant, with a First, and take care\nof his father in his old age, the old tale beloved of Chinese moralists, the\ntale of filial piety.\n\n\nWell, Dad, you had to take that away with you as well, didn\'t you,\nwhen you took everything else.\n\n\nThen he began to blame himself.\n\n\nHe should have sensed that his father was slowly going under: anyone\nwould, with nothing but four mottled aquamarine walls to talk to.\n\n\nHe should have known.\n\n\nHe should have brought his father out.\n\n\nHe should have - slit his father\'s wrists for him. \n\n\nHe lay for nearly an hour, fuming, battling his anger.\n\n\nAbove him the piano-player crashed out the opening chords of\nBeethoven\'s Fifth Symphony, every chord with a note wrong.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c6ac264c-3ea4-48c0-b99c-2db4f68f6223', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.854939+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9960329532623291, 'non_english_score': 0.0039670467376708984}
{'text': 'LOVE\'S LITTLE LEGACY \n\n\nI was in the kitchen, poking a satay-stick through the siew-mai I was\nsteaming when I sensed a presence behind me.\n\n\nLee was standing there, his body leaning against the door.\n\n\nHe wasn\'t looking at me, just at the roses he held in his hands.\n\n\nI strode to where he was.\n\n\n" Lee?" I bent down and stared up at his lowered eyes.\n\n\n" Oh!\n\n\nMei!" He looked startled.\n\n\nThe roses hung limply and the plastic that wrapped them crackled.\n\n\nI have known Lee for three years and I suppose, knowing him that\nlong, I\'m pretty familiar with his moods.\n\n\nRight now, he is not too communicative.\n\n\nSomething must be bugging him.\n\n\nI know well to leave him alone.\n\n\n" Here," I said, giving him a shove, " you go and rest for a while,\nthen later I\'ll scoop you a dish of siew-mai." He nodded and suddenly he was\naware of the flowers he held.\n\n\n" For you,\' he said, thrusting them literally onto me, his eyes fixed\non the flowers, his mind I think probably miles away.\n\n\nI was somewhere between exclamations of astonishment and ecstasy when\nhe turned abruptly, dragging his feet into his room.\n\n\nMind you, all this time I\'ve known this man of mine, he never buys me\nflowers, let alone roses.\n\n\nTo him roses embody passionate love and he is not the passionate\nsort.\n\n\nHe probably never heard of Don Juan.\n\n\nI love flowers.\n\n\nI love romance.\n\n\nI used to dream that it\'ll be lovely if Lee could write me love notes\neveryday, but well, one has to be realistic.\n\n\nHis parents like me.\n\n\nMy parents like him.\n\n\nWe love each other.\n\n\nTo everybody, we\'re a perfect couple.\n\n\nSo suddenly he brings me roses.\n\n\nI wondered why.\n\n\nSuch demonstrations of affection on his part are rare.\n\n\nCould he be trying to tell me something?\n\n\nThat he was sorry about last night\'s argument?\n\n\nWe seem to be quarrelling these past few months, petty arguments that\nlead nowhere.\n\n\nI\'ve snapped at him several times about his late nights spent\nvisiting his friend\'s sick mother, something I\'ve never got used to.\n\n\nShe was Joe\'s mother.\n\n\nJoe was Lee\'s army pal, perhaps two years older than him but they\nwere the best of friends.\n\n\nI remember that day the hospital called.\n\n\nJoe was involved in an accident and kept asking for Lee.\n\n\nFor five hours Lee had sat at Joe\'s bedside not uttering a single\nword, his hand gripping his friend\'s.\n\n\nJoe managed to whisper, " Take care of Mum" before he died.\n\n\nLee took it upon himself to visit her, initially a few times a week,\nnow every evening after work.\n\n\nCouldn\'t he have spent the time with me?\n\n\nI was jealous, hurt and angry with him for paying her so much\nattention.\n\n\nI knew I shouldn\'t feel this way but I was afraid, afraid of losing\nhim.\n\n\nSomehow I felt that we were drifting further and further apart.\n\n\nI felt a surge of joy, looking at the roses.\n\n\nI unwrapped the plastic and prised out the little card buried in\nthem, the sort you see on the stands during Valentine\'s Day.\n\n\nAs I opened it, my heart missed a beat.\n\n\nWhat could he have written?\n\n\nThe card read: ` Julie, you make my life more meaningful.\n\n\nLee.\'\n\n\nJulie?\n\n\nI stood rooted, my eyes blinked uncomprehendingly at the name.\n\n\nWho was she?\n\n\nThen it struck me.\n\n\nIt hit me so hard that I had to hold onto the chair to stop myself\nfrom blacking out.\n\n\nIt couldn\'t be.\n\n\nThis happened only in the movies.\n\n\nLee loved another girl.\n\n\nIt flashed before me, his moodiness these few months, his sudden\nbursts of temper, his lapses into silence.\n\n\nI thought his late nights were spent visiting Joe\'s mother.\n\n\nNow I thought differently.\n\n\nI gripped the chair hard.\n\n\nWe were planning to marry in six months\' time.\n\n\nThe ringing of the phone jolted me.\n\n\nI stuck the card back into the roses, and walked to the sink.\n\n\nMy hands trembled as I picked up a plate.\n\n\nI heard his door opening and pretended to dry the plate, anything so\nthat my back would face him.\n\n\n" Mei!" He sounded agitated.\n\n\nAs I expected, he headed for the flowers.\n\n\n" Have you seen the card?" I heard the crackle of the plastic, caught\nthe fragrance of the roses, and winced inwardly.\n\n\n" What card?" I tried to hide the undercurrent of anger from creeping\ninto my voice, tried to stifle it with forced nonchalance.\n\n\n" I bought two cards .... put the wrong one in.\n\n\nSorry.\n\n\nI\'ll buy you another next time." The onslaught of tears nearly took\nmy composure away.\n\n\nI gripped the dishcloth hard and willed myself to answer him.\n\n\n" It\'s okay, Lee.\n\n\nThe flowers ....\n\n\nthey\'re more than enough." " Mei ...." I felt Lee staring at me and\nwas glad I wasn\'t facing him.\n\n\nPerhaps he caught the tremor in my voice.\n\n\nPerhaps he was feeling guilty and wanted to make sure ....Well, what\ndid he expect me to say?\n\n\nIt isn\'t everyday a woman stumbles on the fact that her fiancé is\nentangled with another woman.\n\n\nWaves of self-pity overwhelmed me.\n\n\nHe was my man, yes, was, I had been so sure of him before .... but I\ncannot let go like that.\n\n\nI turned around slowly, fighting for self-control, checking back\nfresh tears that threatened to well up in my eyes.\n\n\nI had to make sure.\n\n\nI love him too much.\n\n\nHe was staring at the card he held.\n\n\n" Lee ...." He did not look up.\n\n\nI clenched my fingers into my palm, forcing every ounce of love and\nsincerity into my voice, searching for one last ray of hope.\n\n\n" Lee ....I love you," I said it softly, meaning every word of it,\nhoping to God he\'ll respond.\n\n\nHe muttered, " I love you too," but it sounded so false, so aloof.\n\n\nAs he slammed the door of his room shut, I burst into tears.\n\n\nWhen I stepped out of Lee\'s flat that night, I was determined to\nfight for him.\n\n\nCall it love, call it a woman\'s instinct.\n\n\nI felt he was mine and Julie had no right to him.\n\n\nI felt cheated and angry, angry with myself for not daring to\nconfront him with the truth.\n\n\nBut if I did, I knew I wouldn\'t be able to take it.\n\n\nBetter wild suspicions, then confirmed truth.\n\n\nI still believed in Lee, still clung to the conviction he wouldn\'t do\nthis to me.\n\n\nI blamed Julie, not the man I love.\n\n\nSo I checked his telephone booklet while he was having his bath.\n\n\nMy fingers trembled as I dialled her number.\n\n\n" Hello ...." the connection was poor, but the voice that greeted me\nwas warm and friendly.\n\n\n" Is Julie Kim in?" I asked, hoping she\'ll say no ....\n\n\n" Yes ...." It was then that my nerves broke.\n\n\nI hung up the phone.\n\n\nIt\'s no use.\n\n\nWhat do I ask her?\n\n\nIs Lee in love with you?\n\n\nDid he tell you about me?\n\n\nAn inner voice had chided me, " Confront her, you fool.\n\n\nYou love him, don\'t you?\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for?" Another cautioned me, " Don\'t jump\ninto conclusions so hastily.\n\n\nA note does not mean anything.\n\n\nThink of the times you\'ve shared with him.\n\n\nHas he ever hidden anything from you?"\n\n\nThe first voice pounded stronger than ever, it beat away all\nreasoning.\n\n\n" How stupid can you get ?\n\n\nTell me, what did the note say?\n\n\nAnd haven\'t you noticed his moroseness, his temper lately?\n\n\nHis fits of despair?\n\n\nNow what do all these add up to?" I had to do it.\n\n\nI had to see her.\n\n\nI groped for the directory, flipped it to alpha ` K\' and brought my\nfingers down the listing.\n\n\nKim.\n\n\nKim Jong Yin.\n\n\nKim Julie ....8 Anderson Drive.\n\n\nIt was far from here.\n\n\nI took a cab and as I alighted, I saw the light blazing from the\nwindow.\n\n\nAn elderly lady, about sixty, answered my knock.\n\n\nAll at once I warmed to her.\n\n\nHer eyes sparkled, and her smile was friendly, almost welcoming.\n\n\nHer face radiated a kind of hope, a hope in life.\n\n\n" Is Julie in?"\n\n\nShe looked puzzled.\n\n\n" But I don\'t know you."\n\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\n" Come in, won\'t you?" she invited.\n\n\n" It\'s cold outside."\n\n\nI backed away " I don\'t want to trouble you, Mrs Kim.\n\n\nIf Julie is not in, I\'ll come back another day." Mrs Kim chuckled.\n\n\nIt sounded like a thousand bells were chiming.\n\n\nHer cheeks glowed and I glimpsed a glimmer of mischief dancing in\nher eyes.\n\n\n" Julie?\n\n\nNever mind, come in.\n\n\nShe won\'t be back for a couple of days.\n\n\nYou aren\'t any of her regular friends.\n\n\nBut come in, here," she motioned me to an oversized sofa, " sit\ndown, now tell me, why this urgency to see Julie?\n\n\nYou look very pale, is anything troubling you?" Mrs Kim\'s eyes were\nmirrored with concern.\n\n\nI was so confused, so lost, I didn\'t know what to do.\n\n\nShe seemed to sense it.\n\n\n" You have been friends with Julie a long time?" she asked.\n\n\n" Yes ...." I stammered, " I mean ....no ...."\n\n\nI didn\'t know, what to tell her.\n\n\n" Lee ...." I began ....\n\n\nHer face lit into a smile.\n\n\n" You must be Mei.\n\n\nLee told me a lot about you." I was startled.\n\n\nWhatever I expected, it was not this.\n\n\n" Lee must have explained about the card to you .... or didn\'t he?"\nI shook my head, the words coming out in a rush.\n\n\n" Mrs Kim ....I love Lee, we were planning to get married soon, then ....then ....your\ndaughter ...." " My daughter?\n\n\nYou mean, Lee told you ...." " No, I didn\'t ask him.\n\n\nI read the card ....pretended I haven\'t....then I came here.\n\n\nI wish I didn\'t." I was desperate, my nerves were stretched to the\nraw and I was appealing to her, hoping she would understand.\n\n\nWhen she spoke, her voice was gentle.\n\n\n" What do you want me to do, Mei?\n\n\nTell Julie not to see Lee again?\n\n\nTell Lee not to come here again?\n\n\nWould it be fair?"\n\n\nI did not answer her.\n\n\nSomehow what she said made sense.\n\n\n" If Lee told you he needed a break, he wanted to think things over ....what\nwould you do?\n\n\nDo you love him enough to let him go?" I didn\'t think of it this\nway.\n\n\nIf he had told me that, I\'d probably start an argument with him.\n\n\nBut I didn\'t tell her that.\n\n\nIt sounded silly.\n\n\nDo I love him enough to let him go?\n\n\nDo I?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nMrs Kim took hold of my hand and squeezed it.\n\n\n" Mei, sometimes things are not as bad as you think.\n\n\nYou must rely on your faith in Lee.\n\n\nThat is what makes a relationship last.\n\n\nIf you had asked him, he\'d tell you Julie was his close friend ....\n\n\nWould you have believed that?\n\n\nIs your love strong enough to take this kind of test?\n\n\nThis is something you have to decide for yourself.\n\n\nIt\'s coming to terms about your love for Lee.\n\n\nNobody can help you, not even Lee.\n\n\nLove is a funny thing, Mei.\n\n\nIt can make you laugh, sometimes cry, then you\'ll wonder, is it\nworth it?\n\n\nWhy does he mean so much to me?\n\n\nBut you know that no matter what happens, you won\'t exchange this\nfor anything else ....\n\n\nit\'s an experience you want to feel forever...."\n\n\nShe smiled sadly.\n\n\nHer eyes were closed, as if she was reliving a moment in her life.\n\n\nA very special moment.\n\n\nShe was in a world of her own.\n\n\nI watched her, sharing her thoughts, my hand in hers.\n\n\n" I was in love, a long time ago.\n\n\nIt was during the war days.\n\n\nHe was a Japanese soldier and my family hated all Japanese.\n\n\nMy brother had been shot in the head by one of them.\n\n\nBut my soldier was different. \n\n\nHe hated the war.\n\n\nHe wanted to get back to Japan, to see his family.\n\n\nHe said he would bring me with him ....\n\n\nthen I was only nineteen.\n\n\nI didn\'t know\' what love was.\n\n\nHe told me love is something you give, and no matter how much you\ngive, you find there\'s always some more to give.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '84232281-b3d5-4225-a064-6f8db3a57c73', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.856190+00:00', 'english_score': 0.993579626083374, 'non_english_score': 0.0064203739166259766}

confidence.\n\n\nI had dealt with her often enough to know this.\n\n\nBut the pieces I had brought were small pieces of porcelain,\nreminiscent of past use and only of present decorative value.\n\n\nIt really was a beautiful cupboard.\n\n\nLike all cupboards made during that time, it was deep rather than\ntall.\n\n\nThe two doors did not quite meet now and were slightly tilted and\nchipped.\n\n\nBut carved into the rich brown rosewood panelling was an intricate\npattern into which the traditional pattern of dragon and the phoenix were\ninterwoven.\n\n\nHere and there were scratches and nicks and the odd watermarks where\ncareless hands had left water to seep into the old wood.\n\n\nThere was a curious burn mark on one side as if someone had lit a\ncandle inside.\n\n\nI had to have it.\n\n\nMrs Lee named an exorbitant price.\n\n\nAfter a little haggling, I decided that it would be my last\nextravagant purchase for the year and oh, what the heck, I bought the\ncupboard.\n\n\nThe arrangements for its delivery settled, Mrs Lee leaned forward\nagain.\n\n\n" The cupboard has a very interesting history..."\n\n\nBut before she could continue, the bell at the entrance tinkled and\nshe tottered off to give the new customer some service.\n\n\nI went off, knowing full well that sometimes the interesting stories\nbehind these antiques were merely to justify the high prices on them.\n\n\nWhen the cupboard arrived, it was installed proudly in the study.\n\n\nIt fitted right in with the other relics of my interest in that room.\n\n\nIt looked as if it had always been there.\n\n\nThe computer now looked out of place, but as it was the most\nconvenient thing on which to prepare lectures and organise one\'s life as a\nuniversity lecturer, the computer was a necessary evil.\n\n\nThe bright, almost fluorescent screen never seemed to bear easy on\nthe eyes.\n\n\nMy finger tips felt numb after hours of inputting ideas, ideas which\nwhen reprinted on my laser printer look impersonal and cold.\n\n\nEven letters typed on the computer carry a curt formality.\n\n\nIt did, how ever, look professional and often one concealed the\nquality of one\'s work by its impressive professional appearance.\n\n\nI would work putting in long hours at the green screen and then take\nbreaks, taking long looks at the cupboard.\n\n\nEvery time, I looked at it, I found pleasure in some particular\ndetail in the carving I had missed before.\n\n\nTime and time again, my fascination with the cupboard was renewed.\n\n\nThe cupboard became a presence, a very real presence.\n\n\nThen I became aware that things in the cupboard were rearranged from\ntime to time.\n\n\nI was quite sure my mother never came into the study to pack my\nthings ( At 19, I had declared it out of bounds to all Mothers.\n\n\nShe generally thought of it as a disaster area and yet things in the\nroom found themselves in a kind of order.\n\n\nThe cupboard was especially packed neatly and, books strangely\nstacked in alphabetic order according to author.\n\n\nIn more than little ways I found my life rearranged.\n\n\nMy field of study was the dry dustheap of recorded human existence,\nHistory.\n\n\nI was writing my doctoral dissertation on Straits Culture.\n\n\nSure, I like History.\n\n\nI had got good marks for it throughout Secondary School because I was\nable to retain facts fairly well.\n\n\nI didn\'t particularly love it with the kind of devotion that the\nother lecturers did, but my mother encouraged me to take it up to the level\nof academia.\n\n\nShe wanted a doctor in the house and since none of us had entered the\nMedicine faculty, this was the next best thing.\n\n\nAnyway, from pages of reference books left open at odd places, I\nfound myself musing more often than not about the faces which looked out at\nme from history.\n\n\nNameless faces from crowds.\n\n\nNot the pioneers and rich philanthropic traders.\n\n\nAnonymous persons frozen in formal poses in sepia print.\n\n\nPeople caught unawares by cumbersome cameras trained on the crowds.\n\n\nThis awareness made my research take on a more human face.\n\n\nI caught myself writing differently from what I was used to and had\nto stop myself and attune myself to the fact that this was a doctoral thesis\nand not an informal chronicle or a story book.\n\n\nAt that time, I was actually hardly really conscious of what was\ngoing on.\n\n\nIt didn\'t really bother me.\n\n\nThen I began to sense something or someone behind me while I was\nworking.\n\n\nIt wasn\'t uncomfortable or evil.\n\n\nIt was just there.\n\n\nI ignored the feeling and put more effort into my work.\n\n\nThe deadlines for submissions were at approximately the same time as\nwhen the student examination papers would arrive for grading.\n\n\nI worked hard, harder as deadlines drew nearer.\n\n\nUntil one night, just before deadline, almost brain-dead from\nexhaustion, I collapsed on the table and fell asleep.\n\n\nWhen I woke, the first sound I heard was the sound of rustling paper.\n\n\nThrough the haze of half-sleep, I perceived that something was going\nthrough my papers and clicking its teeth in some disapproval at what it was\nreading.\n\n\nI rubbed my eyes.\n\n\nIt didn\'t go away.\n\n\nI can\'t really say I could see it, at least not clearly but I could\nsense it and trace a hazy outline of what seemed to be a human form.\n\n\nIt turned and smiled in its own way.\n\n\nThen it spoke.\n\n\n" You wouldn\'t by any chance have a dictionary around, would you?"\n\n\n" No," I replied, slightly confused.\n\n\n" I thought not.\n\n\nI haven\'t seen one around."\n\n\nIt said thoughtfully and then added, " So how do you know anything\'s\nspelt right?"\n\n\n" There\'s a spelling check in the computer which I use to correct\nspelling errors," I answered, still slightly confused.\n\n\n" Computer?\n\n\nWhat\'s that?"\n\n\nI pointed at the computer in the corner.\n\n\n" Oh, so that\'s what a computer looks like...\n\n\nShow me how it works please," It had asked politely and though I\nfelt a little foolish, I obliged and gave the thing a short computer\nappreciation course.\n\n\nAll the time that I talked, it bent its head to one side, hand\npropped under its chin listening intently and muttering " interesting...\ninteresting..."\n\n\n" And that\'s what a computer can do..." I rounded off the\npresentation.\n\n\nThere was a brief silence and then it spoke again.\n\n\n" It does so much...\n\n\nbut it has...\n\n\nno character, no soul.\n\n\nI don\'t like it.\n\n\nMaybe...\n\n\nthat\'s why you write...like this." It pointed to my thesis.\n\n\n" Hey, that\'s a different thing altogether.\n\n\nThat\'s my thesis," The thing protested.\n\n\n" It has no soul." I was beginning to get angry.\n\n\n" Who or what do you think you are, anyway, to come barging in and\ngoing through my things?\n\n\nSticking your nose into other people\'s business!" For a moment, the\nthing kept quiet.\n\n\nThen, it stuck out a hand and said, " Call me Egbert.\n\n\nI live in your cupboard."\n\n\n" Then, you really are a ghost!" Somehow the thought did not scare\nme.\n\n\n" Yes, I\'m afraid so.\n\n\nI\'ve got to go now.\n\n\nI\'ve stayed out too long.\n\n\nWe\'ll talk again."\n\n\nIt disappeared.\n\n\nI knocked the side of my head and pinched myself hard.\n\n\nHad I really been talking to a...\n\n\nghost?\n\n\nNow if I had been dreaming, I would have been asleep.\n\n\nIf I had been asleep, I would have had to wake up.\n\n\nBut I didn\'t wake up.\n\n\nTherefore I hadn\'t slept.\n\n\nI hadn\'t dreamt it.\n\n\nI spent the rest of the night until the morning, puzzling over what\nhad happened.\n\n\nI couldn\'t explain it.\n\n\nI didn\'t dare.\n\n\n" Here, take this." A pen was thrust into my hand.\n\n\n" Go ahead, write with it..." I removed the cap and drew a few\npreliminary lines over the paper before me.\n\n\n" Nice, isn\'t it?" Egbert said, with a kind of satisfied smile.\n\n\n" That has got soul, and character." It did have character, the gold\ntip was smooth and though the ink was old, it was an interesting shade of\nblue.\n\n\nIt fitted into my hand comfortably.\n\n\nI began to draw rough lines testing out the terrain of the tip.\n\n\nIt felt good.\n\n\n" Nice pen," I said.\n\n\n" It\'s mine," he said.\n\n\n" Now it\'s yours."\n\n\n" Why?"\n\n\n" Consider it a gift."\n\n\nThen he disappeared, leaving behind more unanswered questions.\n\n\nThen something strange happened.\n\n\nNot that all this was not already strange enough.\n\n\nIt began with some phone calls.\n\n\n" Hello, may I speak to Egbert Lim?" the caller had asked.\n\n\n" I\'m sorry.\n\n\nThere\'s no one by that name living here."\n\n\n" Is this 4442233?"\n\n\n" Yes, it is but there is no one called Egbert living here." "\nGoodbye." My mother hung up and muttered " Pranksters." She saw me and\ncomplained about a number of phone calls from various people who claimed to\nbe from magazine companies.\n\n\nSomeone was using our phone number as a prank.\n\n\nThey all spoke of one thing.\n\n\nThey wanted to contact someone called Egbert and pay him for his\nstories.\n\n\nI gasped.\n\n\n" Er ...\n\n\nMum, the next time one of them calls, call me okay?\n\n\nI\'ll take a message."\n\n\n" Then you know who this Egbert fellow is, hah?\n\n\nTell him to get his own phone number.\n\n\nI\'m tired of taking messages for him.\n\n\nWhat kind of friends do you have, son?\n\n\nTell him to call Telecoms...\n\n\nNowadays, very cheap and very quick..."\n\n\nBelieve me, I tried.\n\n\nBut how was one to contact a ghost?\n\n\nI tried putting my head into the cupboard and speaking into it.\n\n\nAfter a while, I felt silly and gave up.\n\n\nEgbert was keeping a low profile.\n\n\nI wasn\'t about to tell my mother about the spirit in the cupboard.\n\n\nNeither could I tell the magazine people who Egbert was.\n\n\nWho would believe me?\n\n\nOnce in a while, when a script was rejected, it came back in the\nstandard brown envelope.\n\n\nUnlike modern scripts, this was handwritten neatly with ink, blue\nink.\n\n\nInterestingly, the scripts all had an unusual number of spelling\nerrors which riddled the impeccable grammar.\n\n\nEgbert, my friendly ghost ( if you pardon the expression) could not\nspell for the life of him.\n\n\nI was hard put to keep explaining that Egbert was not available for\nany one to talk to.\n\n\nMother began to suspect that I was really Egbert.\n\n\n" Now, really, son, if you wanted to write under another name, you\ncould have chosen something else other than Egbert, couldn\'t you?\n\n\nWhat\'s wrong with the name your father and I gave you?" The\npublishers began to address the cheque to me since I was Egbert\'s friend.\n\n\nFor ten months or so, Egbert did not put in an appearance.\n\n\nStill, the stories were sent out somehow.\n\n\nAnd the cheques came in regularly.\n\n\nI put them into a bank and refused to touch the money. \n\n\nBy this time, the work on my theses had ground to a standstill.\n\n\nI was thoroughly distracted by what was happening.\n\n\nI began to read the stories that Egbert had written.\n\n\nI must admit that with my meagre literary background that they were\nwell-written pieces.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1cef3e8e-187c-4049-87a8-daa00bccdd4b', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.857512+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9889106750488281, 'non_english_score': 0.011089324951171875}

Wen Ei asked.\n\n\nGrace didn\'t answer.\n\n\nShe was standing in the middle of the large hall, turning slowly to\nlook at each wall in turn.\n\n\nWen Ei knew Grace well enough to realise that she was planning,\ndesigning, plotting exactly what would be done and how it would be done.\n\n\nIt was a long room.\n\n\nOne end opened to the purple bougainvillea-shadowed balcony, while the\nother led to the passage which ran alongside the \'sky-well\' to the kitchen.\n\n\nWe can have barbecues in the sky-well, Wen Ei had said excitedly when\nshe saw this.\n\n\nTwo bed-rooms opened off the hall, facing a wall of windows, casually\nbarred in with sturdy metal that was beginning to rust.\n\n\nOne bedroom was empty except for the thick dust on the floor.\n\n\nThe other contained an incredibly high, hard bed and a row of dark\nwood cupboards with doors that wouldn\'t open.\n\n\n" No," said Grace, long after Wen Ei had given up expecting a reply,\n" No, I don\'t regret it at all.\n\n\nIt\'s a wonderful house.\n\n\nWe were meant to be here."\n\n\n" They had been talking about buying a place together for a long\ntime, ever since coming back from America.\n\n\nWhy had they put it off till now?\n\n\nToo much of a commitment?\n\n\nA commitment to keeping their jobs, to seeing through the mortgage,\nto staying in Singapore...\n\n\nor was it just a matter of waiting for the right house?\n\n\nWen Ei had been ready to put her money down on the first place that\nthey saw.\n\n\nThis had been a compact little flat in Clementi.\n\n\nWen Ei had been sure that it could be done up.\n\n\nWen Ei was always working up enthusiasm for the most unsuitable\nthings.\n\n\nIn retrospect, the Clementi flat was much too small and had a front\ndoor that opened onto the garbage pickup point.\n\n\nIt would have had bad feng shui.\n\n\nGrace was not superstitious about feng shui, but she was particular.\n\n\nGrace didn\'t mind living in a rented flat, but she was reluctant to\nput her money in one.\n\n\nIf she was to be a property owner, she wanted to own land; land that\nshe was responsible for, that she could dig and plant sensible things in,\neven if it was only pandan leaves or tapioca.\n\n\nGrace was very practical and the money she inherited from her\ngrandparents allowed her the luxury of being practical.\n\n\nShe wanted to be able to tear down her house and live in a tent if\nshe wanted to.\n\n\nTo rebuild on her land.\n\n\nSure, your strata title established your claim to your cube of\napartment air-space, but up there you were surrounded by air-space that\nbelonged to other people.\n\n\nWen Ei, having lived all her conscious years in an HDB flat before\ngoing to Michigan, didn\'t find it disturbing to be surrounded by other\npeople\'s air-space.\n\n\nShe liked the apartment they rented in St Thomas Walk, and she hadn\'t\nbeen in any hurry to move even if she did want to buy every apartment they\nsaw.\n\n\nWen Ei could probably have spent the rest of her life in St Thomas\nWalk quite contentedly.\n\n\nAfter all, Grace paid most of the rent.\n\n\nBut then they found this house.\n\n\nIt was almost as though it had been waiting for them even before they\nknew they were looking for it.\n\n\nThe house was set almost at the top of a long, upward-winding road,\nand behind the house the slope continued into restless trees which grew tall\nout of a tangle of luxuriant undergrowth.\n\n\nThere were birds, there were butterflies, the air smelt of damp earth\nand happy kampong childhood and an Indian neighbour who was airing her two\nbeautiful Eurasian babies told them that at times monkeys came out of the \'jungle\'\nto play in the gardens, especially when you had ripe mangoes and papayas.\n\n\n" Monkeys in the garden," Wen Ei said rapturously, picturing postcard\nsweet chimpanzees.\n\n\n" They\'re probably vicious.\n\n\nAnd she said that snakes come up in the rainy season,"\n\n\n" But monkeys," said Wen Ei dreamily.\n\n\nOf course they bought the house.\n\n\nGrace took two weeks leave following the move.\n\n\nWen Ei said she wanted to do the same, but with SBC\'s tenth\nanniversary coming up, it was impossible.\n\n\nIn any case, Wen Ei wasn\'t too interested in things like cleaning and\nclearing.\n\n\nSo Grace set out to tackle that alone.\n\n\nGrace started in the bedroom they were going to turn into a study.\n\n\n" It\'s so strange," Grace told Wen Ei that night, " I kept feeling\nthat someone was watching me\'.\n\n\nIt\'s such a small, stuffy room.\n\n\nWe\'ll have to clear the bushes outside the window to let more light\nin, and I think it could do with some extra wiring.\n\n\nAnd we\'ll have to get rid of the cupboards and the bed.\n\n\nYou know, it\'s so weird, I kept thinking someone was lying on the bed\nwatching me."\n\n\n" Maybe we should get you a radio to keep you company," Wen Ei\nsuggested, thinking about car-pets and pictures and spot lighting.\n\n\n" You know, I thought I actually saw someone there?\n\n\nOn the bed."\n\n\n" Who?"\n\n\n" I don\'t know.\n\n\nAt first I thought a very old woman.\n\n\nLying back, you know...because of the shadows.\n\n\nIn a sort of flowered thing.\n\n\nThen I thought it wasn\'t a woman at all; it was an enormous cat."\n\n\n" You mean like a lion or a tiger?"\n\n\n" No, if I meant a lion or a tiger I would have said so.\n\n\nIt was a cat, a pussy cat, only really enormous, you know." Wen Ei\ndidn\'t know.\n\n\nShe wasn\'t very interested and felt that Grace wasn\'t paying\nattention to her plans.\n\n\nThey could get a dog, she thought.\n\n\nNow they had a garden and there was room enough for a dog to run\nabout, they could get a dog.\n\n\nIt would have to be bathed and walked, but Grace would probably enjoy\ndoing that.\n\n\n" Let\'s get a dog."\n\n\n" No!"\n\n\nFor a moment, Grace\'s face was livid with anger.\n\n\nWen Ei hadn\'t realised Grace was so dead set against dogs.\n\n\nIt was very unfair of Grace not to have told her.\n\n\nWen Ei started to cry, but for once Grace didn\'t come over to soothe\nher and promise her everything she wanted.\n\n\nInstead Grace went back into the bedroom wearily to continue cleaning\nit out.\n\n\nPerhaps, Wen Ei thought, Grace was allergic to dust and it affected\nher in this way.\n\n\nWen Ei stopped crying since no one was paying attention to her.\n\n\nShe thought she was generous to put up with Grace until all the\nmoving in problems were sorted out.\n\n\nWhich seemed to be taking a long time.\n\n\n" Why is it taking so long?" " Why is what taking so long?"\n\n\n" I mean, it\'s just cleaning, right?"\n\n\n" There are so many cupboards," Grace said vaguely.\n\n\n" Why don\'t you just focus on cleaning the windows and floors and\nwalls.\n\n\nIf we\'re going to throw out the cupboards anyway, there\'s no point\ncleaning them up first, right?"\n\n\n" I don\'t know, I think we should keep them.\n\n\nThey\'re beautiful pieces.\n\n\nYou don\'t get wooden furniture like that any more."\n\n\n" Personally, I think I\'d prefer something a bit more modern," Wen Ei\nsaid.\n\n\nGrace didn\'t answer.\n\n\nAs though she didn\'t exist, Wen Ei thought grumpily.\n\n\nHer mind ran through all the men who had wanted to marry her.\n\n\nIt was one of her mind\'s favourite occupations.\n\n\nUsually she did it out loud, but the probability that Grace would\nignore her made this a pointless exercise.\n\n\nGrace was sitting on the floor in front of a solid looking cupboard.\n\n\nIt was both solid and unyield - both solid and unyielding.\n\n\nThere was a fold-out cabinet above, three drawers, and then another\nfold-out cabinet below.\n\n\nIt was this second fold-out cupboard that Grace was working on.\n\n\nThe doors were jammed and Grace was trying to ease them open.\n\n\n" Just force it," Wen Ei said.\n\n\nGrace didn\'t answer.\n\n\nWen Ei was hurt.\n\n\nAfter all, she had been trying to be helpful and it was very\nmagnanimous of her to try after the way Grace had treated her.\n\n\nBut Grace didn\'t even acknowledge this.\n\n\n" Was anything inside any of the other cup-boards?"\n\n\n" No."\n\n\n" Then there\'s probably nothing inside here either.\n\n\nJust leave it.\n\n\nYou look so tired already, poor thing.\n\n\nCome and have a bath and go straight to bed.\n\n\nWe can finish up tomorrow."\n\n\n" If you slip your hand in at the top while I\'m holding the doors\nopen like that, maybe you can see if you can find the catch."\n\n\nObediently, Wen Ei put her hand into the dark triangle.\n\n\nIt felt horribly dirty and it suddenly struck her that something\ninside the unpleasant darkness of the cupboard was going to reach out and\nslash its fangs through her vulnerable hand.\n\n\nShe slid her fingers down where the two doors met in front.\n\n\n" There\'s a metal loop on each door, and some-thing through them."\n\n\n" See if you can slide it out." Wen Ei pinched the cylindrical\nobject between her index finger and middle finger and slid it out.\n\n\nThe doors opened out under Grace\'s hands.\n\n\nWen Ei looked at the object in her hand.\n\n\nIt was a Chinese pen, but a strange one; its body was thicker than\nWen Ei\'s thumb and it was patterned all over with inked-in scratches.\n\n\nInside the cupboard there was only an old book.\n\n\nGrace lifted it out.\n\n\nIts pages were yellow with age and as thin and powdery as moth\nwings.\n\n\nGrace blew on it.\n\n\nThe cover was missing, but it was clear but it was clear that it was\nsome sort of a translating dictionary.\n\n\nOne of the languages was Chinese, but they couldn\'t tell what the\nother language was.\n\n\nIt seemed more a series of coded symbols than a language.\n\n\nThere were actually pictures and diagrams.\n\n\nThe squat book sat comfortably in Grace\'s lap but somehow made her\nfeel uncomfortable.\n\n\nAgain, and even more strongly, she felt that there was someone\nwatching her.\n\n\nWhen she turned to look, the bed ( like the cupboard) was bare, ( as\nshe had expected it to be) - but it was the bareness of anticipation.\n\n\n" Do you think this is writing?"\n\n\nWen Ei passed her the Chinese pen and took the book.\n\n\n" I wonder if this is worth anything.\n\n\nIt looks like it\'s really old."\n\n\nThe scratches on the pen matched the scratches in the book, Grace\nsaw.\n\n\nBut it was strange to her how the pen felt safe and comforting while\nthe book felt full of a dangerous, latent power.\n\n\nGrace closed her fingers around the pen.\n\n\nIt comforted her.\n\n\nWen Ei turned the pages of the book, delicately, between two careful\nfingers.\n\n\nWen Ei had beautiful fingers, long and tapered, like those of\nancient courtesans whose only duty is to sing for emperors.\n\n\nWen Ei would have been a perfect, pampered courtesan.\n\n\nUnfortunately for her she had been born too late into an age that\nexpected women to take responsibility for their own lives.\n\n\nWith her slender fingers, Wen Ei turned the ancient pages which no\nemperors had looked into, but which had been consulted to shape the destiny\nand deaths of emperors.\n\n\nWen Ei read aloud from the book, making out the Chinese symbols\nwhich made no sense to her as she sounded them.\n\n\nBut the thick pen danced in Grace\'s grasp, struggling towards the\ngirl beside her, as though to stab her through.\n\n\nGrace held it, and it transferred the desire to her, the desire to\nrip itself through Wen Ei\'s throat and shred the pages of the book she held.\n\n\nBut a movement behind them arrested all other movement in the room.\n\n\nAs Wen Ei spoke the words she did not understand, darkness had\ncollected from different parts of the room.\n\n\nDarkness that had been banished into different parts of different\ncupboards in different rooms of the house and bound there by charms.\n\n\nStray darkness that hadscattered and escaped the binding. \n\n\nThe darkness collected itself on the bed, but it was not yet whole.\n\n\nIt was still a shadow without substance, the shadow of an old, old\nwoman; or, if you looked again, the shadow of an enormous, malevolent cat.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'fb371029-4995-411f-a149-5ade2dcc64d6', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.860650+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9915208220481873, 'non_english_score': 0.008479177951812744}

we learnt in\nthis way to resolve things between ourselves by bargaining, trading or, most\nof the time, fighting and shouting.\n\n\nWe were more unruly than my father might have liked, but none of us\ncould ever be accused of being a tattletale or mother\'s favourite.\n\n\nEe Lan tried her luck that day and failed.\n\n\nI was a boy, my mother said, and it was best that I have my own room\nuntil Ee Lin came back for holidays.\n\n\nEe Lan, 16, raged against the sexual discrimination of the entire\nworld, about jobs and the right to vote and how hunting animals was no longer\nimportant and we were all equal now.\n\n\nMy mother, unmoved, kept cutting cucumbers for dinner.\n\n\nTo keep the peace as we grew, she persuaded my father to renovate and\nbuild three extra rooms in the garden where his favourite papaya trees grew,\nbut that was much later.\n\n\nI enjoyed my room for six months before Tim came to stay and share\nit.\n\n\nMy mother broke the news to me.\n\n\nShe was sure we would get on, my cousin was a very nice, quiet boy,\nvery polite.\n\n\nHe played the piano - Grade Eight - and Auntie June often asked him\nto play classical pieces after dinner.\n\n\nThis sort of news was less than impressive to me at an age when my\nfavourite singer was David Bowie.\n\n\nTim had to do a lot to convince me that his presence was anything but\nan intrusion.\n\n\nWhen he arrived he first made friends with my sisters.\n\n\nHe played piano while they tried to sing and dreamt of taking part in\nTalentime.\n\n\nThen he won my father over, listening to him talk about gardening and\nfruit trees, helping him and the gardener on Saturdays.\n\n\nHe was a dark-eyed, fair boy with bak-pau cheeks, well groomed, short\nhair, and a powerful frame which seemed too big and mature for the short\npants we wore to school.\n\n\nHe was good at all subjects and even his Malay, which had ruined him\nfor Malaysian schools, was fine by our standards.\n\n\nHis best subject was Maths.\n\n\nIt was something he had an instinct for; he was solving problems\nbefore the teacher could and practising from a Sec Four book.\n\n\nHe was also a good runner, tennis player and played songs during\nrecess on the school piano in the hall, any number which our classmates\nrequested.\n\n\nHe was always nice, cheerful and helpful to everyone.\n\n\nIn a month he made more friends in the class than I, a bit of a\nloner, had during the whole of Sec One.\n\n\nI should have been jealous, I guess, and I think I would have been if\nnot for Tim.\n\n\nHe quietly spoke up for me with my family so my parents and even my\nsisters occasionally saw my point of view, and our house became more\npeaceful.\n\n\nEvery friend he made in school, he insisted get along with me and be\nmy friend too.\n\n\nHe helped me with Maths and my other weak subjects when we studied\ntogether in that room, without ever acting too smart.\n\n\nHe always asked and deferred to me in Geography and History, which\nwere my strong subjects - up to then, I was doing well in them but came close\nto failing the rest.\n\n\nWe played a lot of tennis together too, both at school team practices\nand on our own.\n\n\nAll day on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\n\nAnd, on Thursdays and Fridays, we\'d wake up early - Tim leaning over\nto nudge me after the alarm went - pack our uniforms into sports bags,\nchange, pick up our rackets and basket of tennis balls and go.\n\n\nWe\'d play at the club until it was 11.00 and the sun was hot, almost\noverhead - my rocket serve and forehand pitted against Tim\'s steadiness and\nability to exploit my awkward backhand - then shower or swim instead of\nshowering and rush off to school.\n\n\nI improved, learnt to hit less wildly and played singles for the\nschool team.\n\n\nOne Saturday afternoon, we took on my father and another doctor who\nhad up to then confounded the directness of our youthful game with lobs and\ndrop shots, and we beat them for the first time.\n\n\nThe next year, when we were in morning session, we continued the\nroutine by simply reversing it and playing after school.\n\n\nWe won the under-16 Doubles Championships and Tim was the runner-up\nin Singles.\n\n\nOur school was champion that year and sometimes the girls at the club\nwould ask us to join them for a game and a swim after.\n\n\nWe both played for Combined Schools and wore our badges and track\ntops around at every opportunity.\n\n\nBut if there was any one thing that really won me over, it was his\nsense of humour.\n\n\nBeneath that quiet, polite, eager, agreeable exterior, Tim had a vein\nof wicked humour.\n\n\nHe breathed cutting asides to me in the very presence of the person\nhe was making fun of; our teachers, my father, his father, our tennis coach,\nthe giggly girls we\'d meet.\n\n\nThese were too many to remember.\n\n\nWhat I remember more clearly were the occasional pranks.\n\n\nTim was a great mimic.\n\n\nEach Sunday night, in our room, he\'d imitate my father giving his\nlatest lecture on gardening.\n\n\nHe telephoned Ee Lan and pretended he was the RTS newscaster she had\na crush on.\n\n\nHe called up our class monitor, a crew cut boy named Yew Huat, and,\nmimicking our teacher, told him to go to the staff room early the next\nmorning for a meeting.\n\n\nWhen Yew Huat later told us about the practical joke and\nconfidentially asked for our help to find out which of our classmates had\ndone it, I almost gagged trying not to laugh.\n\n\nWe had started out so different, but Tim grew darker and, with\nexercise and our eating contests, I got taller and bigger.\n\n\nBy the end of that first year, people who just met us thought we were\nbrothers.\n\n\nBy the end of the third year, our discipline master Mr Tan caught Tim\nfor long hair and thought he was me.\n\n\nTo sit here on this occasion and think of these things saddens me.\n\n\nI feel old when I touch these memories, not 33 but 63, my father\'s\nage.\n\n\nBut I can\'t help myself.\n\n\nI only visited this town, this house, to see Tim in the holidays when\nhe came home.\n\n\nI see the market and hawker stalls where we temporarily escaped the\nconstant hunger of adolescence, the courts near the old tin quarries where\nwe\'d play all afternoon, the river at the edge of town which made a natural\nwater slide from the rocks it had smoothed, where we\'d swim in the hot\nafternoons, and the street of narrow houses, stylish brothels during the tin\nboom but run down even in our youth, where fat, dark women sat in the doorway\nunder the red light and called us as we each, laughing, tried to push the\nother towards them.\n\n\nI see the bungalow with its roof tiles still green and shiny, the\nlions of prosperity by the gate, the garden and patio at its centre, where\nAuntie June would trim her rose bushes at 4.30 and have tea, and the room Tim\nand I would share.\n\n\nI see them all as they were.\n\n\nNothing of the slow erosion of time and prosperity the town and house\nhave suffered registers in my mind.\n\n\nMy memories are fuelled by guilt: I lost touch with Tim some years\nago.\n\n\nIt was my work, first at university and then in the firm - a manager\nin an accounting firm just has just too many partners to answer to and too\nmany juniors to lead.\n\n\nIt was my marriage.\n\n\nThese things must, I know, weigh more in the balance of things than\nthe friendship of a cousin, but when I sit here I cannot excuse myself.\n\n\nI should have kept in touch with him We were 17 when he left.\n\n\nOne weekend, Uncle Keong Tim visited and told him and my parents the\nplan after Sunday dinner.\n\n\nEk Tim was going to England.\n\n\nThere he would do his A-levels in a special school and finish them in\none year.\n\n\nHe would be in University by 18 and, because he was Malaysian and\ndidn\'t have to do Army, would be finished with his first degree by 21.\n\n\nAfter all, Tim had gotten six P1s and two P2s in the exams.\n\n\nMy father said he thought it was an excellent idea and that he would\nhave done it too, but for the fact that I had to do NS.\n\n\nI would go to university in England after that.\n\n\nI had, my father recalled perfectly, five P1s ( not mentioning the\nthree P4s with which I had marred my certificate).\n\n\nMaybe, my uncle finished, Ek Tim would still be there, doing his PhD.\n\n\nThen the two brothers talked about the possibility of pooling their\nresources to buy a flat in London so they wouldn\'t have to pay rent for us; a\nplace to stay when they visited on holiday and hold as an investment.\n\n\nI was at the table still finishing my second helping.\n\n\nI looked closely at my uncle as they spoke.\n\n\nHe was my father\'s younger brother, the second son of my grandfather,\nbut he had more white hair and wrinkles, looser skin and a buttery paunch\nwhich he wore under a sports T-shirt.\n\n\nThese things might have made him look older than my father who kept\nhimself fairly slim, but he overcame them with joviality, a sense of\nliveliness.\n\n\nHe was always willing to share a beer with us, to jokingly offer us a\ncigarette before pointing to my father and saying that the doctor did not\napprove.\n\n\nUncle Keong Tim was a businessman, a trader, and often said part of\nhis business was getting on with people.\n\n\nHe had other plans for Tim, though. \n\n\nSomething professional like an engineer or lawyer.\n\n\nAs I looked at him and my father, I remembered an old family\nphotograph, taken when they were 18 and 17 respectively.\n\n\nThere, posed formally in the studio on either side of my\ngrandparents, dressed in dark suits which my father kept the habit of\nwearing, they looked so similar.\n\n\nNow they were unmistakably different.\n\n\nI wanted to say something about their plans for us, although it was\nclear it was not my place to.\n\n\nIt was just dazzling.\n\n\nNot just that our fathers knew our exact results, but that Tim was\nleaving and the days of tennis and school work were going to dissolve.\n\n\nIt seemed like we\'d just been allowed to wear long pants to school\nand go to parties where there were girls and, suddenly, our parents were\ntalking about us getting degrees and PhDs.\n\n\nPerhaps that was the first occasion I seriously thought about the\npassage of time.\n\n\nI finished my food and kept quiet.\n\n\nTim went in May, two months later, and things were never the same\nagain.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a6881041-eb7a-43d1-b34a-dbdf6910aac5', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.861873+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9933557510375977, 'non_english_score': 0.006644248962402344}
{'text': 'Kang was standing by the open window of his bed-room when Teck Wu\nknocked at the door.\n\n\nHe was so preoccupied with his thoughts as he gazed at the hibiscus\nplants outside that he did not hear the knock.\n\n\nHis mind was in a state of gloom and he was unaware that the air\noutside was alive with activity.\n\n\nThe morning was bright and cheerful and the leaves of the big mango\ntree outside were rustling in the breeze.\n\n\nLittle flocks of birds, chirping gleefully, were playing \'follow the\nleader\' as they flew high above the roofs of the nearby houses.\n\n\nBut Kang was totally oblivious of their morning salutations although\nhe was very fond of birds, especially the singing ones.\n\n\nAs he stood and stared vacantly out of the window, some of the rays of\nthe morning sun, that were just peering over the roofs of the neighbouring\nhouses and trees and tinting the sky with its silvery and golden hues, gently\ncaressed him.\n\n\nThe rain had stopped at dawn and the grass and leaves of the plants in\nthe garden were still wet.\n\n\nThe tips of most of the leaves were decorated with beads of water\nhanging precariously and threatening to drop on to the ground with the\nslightest agitation.\n\n\nAnd every once in a while, showers of water fell to the ground from\nthe leaves of the mango tree as they rustled excitedly with each gust of\nwind.\n\n\nIn Kang\'s room, there was a smell of refreshing wetness as wafts of\nthe cool after-rain, morning breeze raced through the window every now and\nthen.\n\n\nKang had woken up earlier than usual that morning after a restless\nnight.\n\n\nIt was still far from dawn and the rain was no longer heavy.\n\n\nBut it was not the rain which had woken him up for he could usually\nsleep through even a thunderstorm and it had always been Amy who had to get\nout of bed to shut the windows whenever it rained in the middle of the night.\n\n\nAll that Kang could remember was that the rain had started to fall\nsoon after he went to bed at midnight and had continued to fall throughout\nthe night.\n\n\nAlthough he was innately obsessive about time and punctuality, he\nforgot to see the clock when he awoke that morning - something which he had\nnever failed to do every morning.\n\n\nAll he remembered was that the sky was still dark and the rain had\nlightened to a drizzle.\n\n\nHe tried to fall asleep again but could not.\n\n\nAfter tossing and turning in bed for some time, he decided that it\nwas futile to try and sleep again.\n\n\nBut, because of the rain he could not go out for his usual early\nmorning walk around the estate.\n\n\nSo, he went out of the bedroom instead, and paced up and down the\nliving room.\n\n\nThere was nothing left to do for he had completed packing his things\nthe night before.\n\n\nHe must have walked up and down for at least a hundred times while\nwaiting for the rain to stop completely when his patience was taxed to its\nlimit.\n\n\nFeeling restless and agitated now, he decided to take an unusually\nearly bath - at five in the morning.\n\n\nHe had always taken his bath at seven when the sun and the\ntemperature of the air had risen appreciably so that he would not catch a\nchill.\n\n\nAfter his bath, he changed into a clean, neatly ironed shirt and\npants.\n\n\nHardly a crease could be seen in both his shirt and pants - which\nwere the only clothes of his still hanging in the cupboard.\n\n\nKang had always been very fastidious about his clothes and would\ntrust nobody - not even Amy - but himself to iron them.\n\n\nEven the slightest crease would upset him.\n\n\nHe was very meticulous and systematic in his ironing so that his\nclothes would look immaculately smart.\n\n\nEven the removal of his clothes from the hanger in the cupboard was\nmindfully done so that they would not be prematurely crumpled.\n\n\nAnd even donning his clothes was attentively carried out.\n\n\nIt was still drizzling when Kang finished his bath.\n\n\nStill feeling restless, he decided to have his breakfast - which was\nalso unusually early.\n\n\nAlthough he was living with Teck Wu and his family at that time, Kang\nhad never joined them for breakfast - not even once.\n\n\nUnlike Kang, Teck Wu and his wife, Cynthia, disliked rising early in\nthe morning.\n\n\nThey preferred to sleep until it was absolutely necessary to wake up\nand then gobble a hurried breakfast before rushing off to work.\n\n\nAnd their children too had developed this habit.\n\n\nThe day after moving in to stay with Teck Wu, his eldest son, Kang\nnoticed that the family was always in a rush in the morning.\n\n\nOne after another the bathroom doors would go banging away followed\nby a flurry of activity at the breakfast table.\n\n\nMeaning well, he asked Teck Wu one day, " Why don\'t all of you wake\nup a little early so that you don\'t have to rush so much?" It was a good\nthing, he thought to himself, but did not voice it, that Cynthia was working\nfor Teck Wu or else they would need to own two cars.\n\n\nTeck Wu threw a quick glance at his wife and then said, " No rush,\nPa.\n\n\nWe are quite used to it."\n\n\nBut Cynthia, as Kang later found out from his son, did not take too\nkindly to Kang\'s comments.\n\n\n" Why can\'t he mind his own business," she asked Teck Wu later on\nthat night.\n\n\n" It\'s time he realises that he is only a guest in our house and so\nhe should keep his view to himself.\n\n\nNobody asked him for his views."\n\n\nKang, through years of habit, preferred to rise half an hour or so\nbefore dawn so that he could go for a short brisk walk before the sun peeped\nover the horizon.\n\n\nAnd when he returned home, sweaty after the walk, he would have a\nbath before settling down to a good, early and unhurried breakfast.\n\n\nAnd he applied that habit to his other meals as well.\n\n\nKang and Amy hated gluttony and a hurried meal.\n\n\nUnless they were ill, they had never broken this morning routine -\nwhich by now had become an obsessive ritual for him.\n\n\nBut that morning, Kang was unusually slow in eating his breakfast -\nnot because he was having it unusually early but because his mind was\nwandering and he forgot to swallow whatever his molars had ground to a pulp.\n\n\nBy the time he finished his breakfast, it was already dawn.\n\n\nThe entire household was still sleeping, and the maid, who usually\nwoke up before dawn, had overslept.\n\n\nSlowly he washed his cup, dried it and kept it in its usual place in\nthe cupboard.\n\n\nThen he went back to his bedroom and stood in semi-darkness by the\nwindow as the sky outside was just beginning to brighten.\n\n\nAs he stood erect with his hands together behind his back, a mixture\nof thoughts raced through his mind.\n\n\nHis eyes looked vacant and his face was tinged with an aura of\nsadness.\n\n\nHis mind was so preoccupied with memories of the past that he did not\neven feel the increasing warmth in his body as a broad band of sunlight fell\nobliquely past the neighbour\'s house and the mango tree to enter his window\nand imbue him with its invigorating rays.\n\n\nNor did he hear the creak which the bedroom door made when Teck Wu\nopened it and glanced in after receiving no response to his knock.\n\n\nThinking that his father was in a state of stupor, Teck Wu asked\nsoftly, " Are you okay, Pa?"\n\n\nKang did not seem to hear for he did not respond.\n\n\n" Pa?" Teck Wu asked again, this time louder, as he walked towards\nthe old man and touched his shoulders.\n\n\n" You okay?"\n\n\nIt was Teck Wu\'s tap that jolted Kang out of his mental distractions.\n\n\nIn spite of that, it still took him a few seconds to realise that\nsomeone had touched him and was speaking to him before he responded.\n\n\nSlowly he turned his head to see who it was.\n\n\nAt first, he gazed emptily at Teck Wu, as if he did not recognise his\nson.\n\n\nBut after a few seconds, his whole body jerked as though he was\nemerging from a trance.\n\n\n" Huh?" he muttered.\n\n\nBut his mind had not registered what Teck Wu had said.\n\n\n" Are you okay, Pa?"\n\n\nTeck Wu asked again with great concern.\n\n\nIt took him another few seconds before he comprehended Teck Wu\'s\nquestion.\n\n\nBut he continued looking at his son with a blank stare for a while\nbefore he replied unconvincingly, " Oh, ya.\n\n\nI\'m okay."\n\n\nAfter a brief silence, Teck Wu, who had, hitherto, been the most\npolite and filial of Kang\'s three sons, offered, " I\'m going to office now,\nPa.\n\n\nCan I give you a lift?"\n\n\nBy now, Kang seemed to have regained all his senses.\n\n\nHe turned down Teck Wu\'s offer and answered abruptly, " I\'ll take a\ntaxi."\n\n\nKang and his wife, Amy, had always believed that they should not be\ndependent on their children for anything - anything at all.\n\n\nBringing up their children, they believed, was their moral\nresponsibility since they had brought them out into the world.\n\n\nThey had always told their friends that it would be foolhardy to\nthink that children were dependable and to do so was to bring bitter\ndisappointment upon themselves.\n\n\n" Are you sure you won\'t need me to help you with your things?" Teck\nWu asked his father.\n\n\n" No.\n\n\nI\'m okay," Kang replied confidently with a nod of his head.\n\n\nHe had always been an independent person.\n\n\nSo there was no reason for him to rely on the charity of his son now,\nhe thought to himself.\n\n\nTeck Wu was now lost for words.\n\n\nKang turned round to look out of the window again.\n\n\nAfter a short, uneasy silence, Teck Wu apologised, " Pa, I\'m sorry\nfor all this ..."\n\n\nKang interrupted softly, " You better go.\n\n\nCynthia will be waiting for you."\n\n\nTeck Wu did not know what to say.\n\n\nHe nodded his head but Kang did not turn to look.\n\n\nAfter a while, Teck Wu took a deep breath as if trying to summon all\nhis strength and said, " Pa ..."\n\n\n" Bye," Kang interrupted again and waved his son off.\n\n\nKang always displayed such abruptness and lack of warmth whenever he\nwas upset.\n\n\n" Bye, Pa," said Teck Wu, with his head bent down, as he left the\nbedroom and shut the door behind him.\n\n\nIt was Monday, a week before Christmas.\n\n\nIt was not a day that Kang was looking forward to.\n\n\nHe was moving out of the house.\n\n\nIt was better for him to leave before Cynthia threw her annual\nChristmas party, he decided.\n\n\nTeck Wu and Cynthia had moved up the social ladder and Kang felt\nthat he could not fit into the affluent society in which they were moving.\n\n\nThe events of the last Christmas were still very vivid in his mind.\n\n\nHe recalled how lively the party must have been with the adults\neating and drinking in the garden and the children playing their party games\nin the living room.\n\n\nIn the late afternoon, before the party began, Teck Wu had a little\ntalk with his father who was all neatly dressed up and sitting comfortably on\nthe sofa in the living room, reading the daily newspaper - and waiting for\nthe party to start.\n\n\n" Pa," Teck Wu said, rather nervously.\n\n\n" About tonight\'s party."\n\n\n" Yes?" replied Kang, putting down the newspaper.\n\n\n" I will push the TV into your room so that you can watch whatever\nprogramme you may like."\n\n\nPush the TV?\n\n\nWatch the programmes?\n\n\nKang asked himself.\n\n\nHe was puzzled.\n\n\nWhat did Teck Wu mean?\n\n\nHe was too surprised to say a word.\n\n\nThen Teck Wu added, " You know what I mean? \n\n\nI don\'t think you will feel comfortable with my friends - and\nCynthia\'s friends, too."\n\n\nKang was a very astute man.\n\n\n" You mean to say that you are ashamed of your father?"\n\n\n" No, Pa," Teck Wu hastily answered.\n\n\n" What I mean is that I\'m afraid you will not be able to mix with\nthem.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '08ba9490-97a6-4714-b2be-7cf27e06ff6c', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.863176+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9965270757675171, 'non_english_score': 0.00347292423248291}
{'text': 'From London to Paris \n\n\nRailway stations had always intrigued Lienhwa.\n\n\nTo her, they meant freedom and were gateways to adventure.\n\n\nBut she was familiar with only the old Kowloon-Canton Railway station\nin Hongkong with its familiar clock tower.\n\n\nShe\'d often have tea in the cafe just inside the entrance, happy just\nsitting there watching people spilling out of the trains that delivered them\nfrom China.\n\n\nIt was always such a bustling scene.\n\n\nMothers with babies strapped on their backs, old ladies gamely\ncarrying bamboo baskets of live chickens and sweating coolies, with poles\nacross their bare, muscle-knotted shoulders, groaning under their heavy\nloads.\n\n\nVictoria Station at rush hour, on the other hand, throbbed with the\npulse of a night bazaar on a Chinese New Year\'s Eve, filled with the same\nheaving mass of humanity.\n\n\nOnly the pace, smell and atmosphere differed.\n\n\nHere, people muffled up in thick scarves and heavy coats rushed\nalong.\n\n\nThe tempo in an Eastern bazaar was much more leisurely.\n\n\nThe crowds simply ambled aimlessly and were, of course, more gaily\nattired.\n\n\nAnd instead of the pungent aromas she was accustomed to, Victoria\nStation smelt musty and dank with the winter\'s chill.\n\n\nYet, not even the cold, grey, drabness could dampen her mounting\nexcitement.\n\n\nHurrying beside Jeremy, she felt the same pleasurable anticipation\nshe felt as a child, when, clinging to her father\'s hand, she had taken the\ntrain to Penang, her first journey out of Singapore.\n\n\nThe trip had been her father\'s gift to her when she turned eight.\n\n\nNow, thirteen years later, she was enjoying another birthday treat.\n\n\nOnly the destination this time wasn\'t some quiet seaside hamlet on\nthe coast of Malaya, but the sophisticated, glittering city of Paris.\n\n\nAnd this time she was travelling with her lover, Jeremy Winthrop.\n\n\nJeremy\'s friends, Colonel Ken Pembridge, Captain Anthony James and\ntheir wives, Susan and Bunty, were waiting for them on the platform.\n\n\nAll four had been at Lienhwa\'s twenty-first birthday celebration at\nthe Dorchester the previous night.\n\n\n" I presume you had a good rest Jeremy?" queried Susan.\n\n\n" I surely needed it," Jeremy laughed bashfully.\n\n\nHe turned to direct the porters who were loading all their\nparaphernalia into a first-class compartment.\n\n\nThey were hardly installed in their seats, when Jeremy ordered a\ncouple of bottles of Chateau Margaux.\n\n\n" To Paris," he toasted.\n\n\nEveryone joined in, even Lienhwa.\n\n\nJeremy had insisted on initiating her into the pleasures of the\ngrape.\n\n\n" It\'s time you learned to appreciate the finer things in life," he\ndeclared.\n\n\nHeady with happiness, Lienhwa obliged.\n\n\nShe was too excited to care.\n\n\nIn her new-found euphoria, she simply threw caution to the winds.\n\n\nSnuggling close to Jeremy, she sipped eagerly at the glass of red\nwine he handed her as she watched the countryside flashing by.\n\n\nShe was captivated by the fresh green meadows, the flocks of grazing\nsheep and ewes frolicking in their midst.\n\n\nHere and there, glimpses of well-fed cows and huge long-haired farm\nhorses and old stone cottages dotted a landscape that seemed to appear from\nout of a fairytale.\n\n\nThe train entered a tunnel and out of the darkness there was a sudden\nshriek from Bunty.\n\n\n" Come on, Jeremy, now\'s the time."\n\n\nLienhwa felt Jeremy place a huge parcel on her lap.\n\n\n" You\'ll need this," he said off-handedly.\n\n\nOut into the light, Lienhwa saw the others watching her expectantly.\n\n\nShe undid the gift eagerly and was utterly dumbfounded at the sight\nof the gleaming amber fur nestling within layers of soft, white tissues.\n\n\n" Put it on and see if it fits," urged Bunty.\n\n\n" I helped Jeremy choose it.\n\n\nWe spent ages hunting for the right one.\n\n\nJeremy wanted to get you a black diamond, but Jim at Calman Links\ninsisted it was too old for you." Helped by Jeremy, Lienhwa snuggled into the\nluxurious warmth of the fur.\n\n\nThen turning around, she impulsively flung her arms around him and\nkissed him on the lips.\n\n\n" Nothing like a mink coat to get a woman all worked up.\n\n\nFirst lesson in seduction, right Jeremy?" Anthony said with dry\nhumour.\n\n\nLienhwa hastily detached herself from Jeremy\'s arms at Anthony\'s\nremark.\n\n\nWhat had come over her, she wondered?\n\n\nBrought up the traditional way, she had it dinned into her since\nchildhood that one did not give way to demonstrations of affection,\nparticularly in public.\n\n\nShe adored her father, but would never have dreamt of kissing him.\n\n\nSuch a rash expression of feeling would have embarrassed him.\n\n\nHer mother, stern and uptight, had never petted her; not even when\nshe\'d been very ill with pneumonia.\n\n\nHer old nurse, Ah Fong, had been the only person in Lienhwa\'s\nchildhood to offer some comfort.\n\n\nPerhaps the wine coupled with the decadent lifestyle of Jeremy and\nhis friends were already beginning to have an effect upon her, Lienhwa\nthought guiltily.\n\n\nHer mother would be horrified if she could see her now.\n\n\nIn her opinion, no decent Chinese girl, and certainly not her\ndaughter, should even be seen in the company of a European man, let alone\ntravel around the world with one.\n\n\nIt was unthinkable.\n\n\nAs the merrymaking continued around her, Lienhwa\'s thoughts went back\nto her abrupt departure from Hongkong only a few days previously.\n\n\nHer family\'s shocked reaction was still fresh in her mind.\n\n\nHer mother, prostrate with grief and anger, had from Singapore\ntelephoned Uncle Ping, with whom Lienhwa was staying.\n\n\nShe demanded that Uncle Ping take immediate action and stop Lienhwa\nat all costs.\n\n\nUncle Ping in turn had remonstrated with Lienhwa.\n\n\n" Think of the loss of face for your parents and the whole of the Liu\nclan," he\'d said sadly.\n\n\n" Remember what Confucius said: \'One should think thrice before\nmaking a move.\' You\'ll live to regret this action." But Lienhwa had\nstubbornly refused to heed her Uncle\'s counsel.\n\n\nShe craved freedom!\n\n\nLienhwa moved as if in a dream after they stepped out into the Gare\ndu Nord amidst clouds of steam hissing forth from the engines of the train.\n\n\nQuickening her steps to keep in pace with Jeremy and the others, she\nlooked around the vast, gloomy station in hazy wonder, awed by the\nstrangeness of her surroundings.\n\n\n" Allez, allez, la frite, la bonne frite!" Attracted by the raucous\nsounds uttered in a language she couldn\'t understand, Lienhwa stared\ncuriously at the rough-looking man standing in a far corner, his arms filled\nwith paper bags of food.\n\n\nHe was clad in a pair of crude blue pants with matching jacket over a\nthick grey woollen sweater.\n\n\nOn his head was a faded cap perched at a rakish angle.\n\n\nA half-smoked cigarette trembled precariously at the corner of his\nmouth as he shouted once again, " Allez, allez, la frite ..."\n\n\nThe strong smell of fried oil assailed her nostrils but, from the\ndistance, she couldn\'t quite make out what he was selling.\n\n\nFollowing her gaze, Jeremy asked with an amused smile, " Would you\nlike a packet of French fries, darling?" Lienhwa shook her head, saying with\na laugh, " Is that what it is?"\n\n\nThey hurried on after removing their luggage, anxious to escape from\nthe heaving crowd.\n\n\nNear the entrance of the station, Lienhwa clutched nervously at\nJeremy\'s arm as a couple of workmen lurched pass her on unsteady feet, their\nbreath heavy with the fumes of alcohol.\n\n\nIt was her first shock, and the chilly air did nothing to alleviate\nthe sense of insecurity she felt.\n\n\n" See you both later at the Ritz," said Bunty with an airy wave of\nher gloved hand.\n\n\nThey had separated at the taxi stand, Lienhwa and Jeremy sharing a\ncar on their own.\n\n\nOnce they were settled in the taxi, an overpowering scent assailed\nLienhwa\'s senses.\n\n\nShe wrinkled her nose.\n\n\n" What kind of cigarettes do the French smoke, Jeremy?\n\n\nThey have such a powerful aroma."\n\n\n" It\'s Gauloise.\n\n\nAbsinthe and Gauloise are two of the familiar smells of Paris,"\nreplied Jeremy.\n\n\nAs the taxi cruised along the bank of the Seine, Lienhwa looked out\nof the window with rapt attention.\n\n\nShe marvelled at the architectural beauty of the buildings and sat\nspellbound when the taxi entered Rue de la Paix.\n\n\nJeremy touched her lightly on the arm.\n\n\n" Here\'s where some of the famous jewellers are.\n\n\nLook, there\'s Cartier and Boucheron."\n\n\nMinutes later, the taxi drew alongside the Ritz.\n\n\nWhen they alighted from the car, Lienhwa looked around her with\nwonder, impressed, like all tourists would be, by the imposing spiral bronze\ncolumn topped by the statue of Napoleon.\n\n\nLienhwa felt very small as she followed Jeremy and the porter, in his\nwhite satin waistcoat and green breeches, down the long corridors of the vast\nhotel which, with ageing grace, filled the entire block between the Place\nVendome and Rue Cambon.\n\n\nThe porter ushered them into their suite with grave dignity.\n\n\nShe was stunned by the rooms, although Jeremy moved around them as\nthough they belonged to him.\n\n\nThe enormous high-ceilinged sitting room was a delicate shade of\napricot, warmed by the crackling logs in the fireplace.\n\n\nIntricate mouldings edged the ceiling, and delicate pieces of cream\nand gold furniture were artfully arranged.\n\n\nCrystal vases filled with long-stemmed white roses seemed to be on\nevery available surface.\n\n\n" I ordered them specially for you ...white flowers for my little\nvirgin," Jeremy said, kissing her lightly on the tip of her nose.\n\n\nHe strolled across the room to a bottle of Dom Perignon buried in a\nsilver ice bucket.\n\n\nBeside it was a box of bonbons, exquisitely wrapped with a cluster\nof satin flowers on top.\n\n\n" I need some refreshment," he said, expertly easing the cork out.\n\n\nThere was a quiet pop and hiss and the cork fell on the thick\nsilver-grey carpet.\n\n\nLienhwa felt worried.\n\n\nShe wished he wouldn\'t drink so heavily; he was so much nicer when\nsober.\n\n\n" Jeremy, why don\'t you wait a little while," she said.\n\n\n" I\'m parched and one simply can\'t drink water, it\'s poisonous!\n\n\nBe a pet and keep me company, have a sip." Lienhwa gave a little\nshudder.\n\n\n" I\'m still feeling the effects from all that drinking on the\ntrain." " But darling, a tiny sip won\'t hurt," he said.\n\n\n" Can\'t I have a bath first?\n\n\nI want to freshen up." " Very well then."\n\n\nThe black marble bathroom was the most luxurious Lienhwa had ever\nseen.\n\n\nAs she ran the bath she could hear Jeremy talking over the\ntelephone, making arrangements for the evening\'s entertainment.\n\n\nShe tested the temperature of the water with her toes and then\nslipped into the scented froth with a sigh.\n\n\nEyes closed, she drifted into a half-slumber, wondering what Jeremy\nwas planning.\n\n\n" Wake up darling, you\'ll catch your death of cold if you stay in\nthe water any longer." Jeremy was shaking her gently on the shoulder as he\nhanded her a glass of champagne.\n\n\nShe took a sip, made a grimace, and handed it back.\n\n\nHe turned on the tap, letting hot water gush into the bath,\ntemporarily misting the surrounding mirrors.\n\n\n" Stand up darling, and let me soap you." He lathered her, his\nfingers roving slowly over her body with the adroitness of a masseur\'s,\nkneading and unknotting her muscles, bringing relief and pleasure.\n\n\nSavouring every moment, Jeremy began teasing her clitoris,\nmasturbating her.\n\n\nIt brought back memories she had tried to repress, the times she\'d\ngrip and rub a bolster between her legs to lull herself to sleep.\n\n\nHer old nurse had caught her eventually, and threatened not only to\ntell her mother but take her bolster away.\n\n\nThe thought of losing her precious bolster worried Lienhwa more than\nthe prospect of abandoning her bedtime game.\n\n\nIt was, to her, a sort of teddy bear and security blanket all rolled\ninto one.\n\n\nShe had buried the memory, but as Jeremy stood there looking at her\nwith a teasing look in his eyes, she turned crimson red at the thought, a\nmixture of guilt and shame.\n\n\nScrambling out of the bath, she grabbed a towel from the rails and,\nthrowing it around herself, rushed out of the bathroom. \n\n\nJeremy suggested a nap after her bath as they were going to have a\nlong night ahead of them.\n\n\nWhen he tucked her in, he went into the sitting room and reclining\non the settee sipped his champagne.\n\n\nWhat a child she is, Jeremy thought but that\'s part of her charm.\n\n\nHis mind roved back to the events of the night before and the\nremembrance of how he\'d behaved himself filled him with remorse and he felt\nthoroughly ashamed of himself...', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1561a9cb-d04f-4724-9eec-6002c8fb193a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.864334+00:00', 'english_score': 0.983004093170166, 'non_english_score': 0.016995906829833984}

It was Julie.\n\n\n" Philip would like to see you now." " I\'ll be there." I half smiled,\nas if Julie could see my expression.\n\n\nThis was the inevitable final showdown - an exit interview with the\nHead of Human Resource Management.\n\n\nI strolled into the HRM corner, gave the same half-smile to Julie\nand walked straight into the \'People is our business\' office.\n\n\n" Take a seat, Bam." Philip looked up from his pile of documents,\nmost of them grey with words, with one little corner at the bottom for his\nsignature along the dotted line.\n\n\n" Look, Mister Lim.\n\n\nI am very firm about my......" I was interrupted.\n\n\n" No, I am not here to change your decision.\n\n\nIf anyone could do that, it was Stanley." Stanley was my supervisor.\n\n\n" If your immediate superior could not convince you to stay, then I\ndon\'t think I have a ghost of a chance."\n\n\nThen what am I doing here, I wanted to ask him.\n\n\n" I heard about your car accident.\n\n\nQuite rotten, isn\'t it, slamming into a lamp-post," he continued,\nsmiling warmly.\n\n\n" Yes."\n\n\nIt was lousy, losing control of the steering wheel and crashing right\ninto the light.\n\n\n" There was a girl with you in the car?"\n\n\n" Mmh, yes."\n\n\n" Both of you were not seriously injured, I hope." I flashed a smile,\nflaunting the silver linings in my mouth: " This is the only casualty."\n\n\n" Your mouth hit the front of the car?"\n\n\n" The steering wheel, actually."\n\n\nHe suddenly looked down and signed the document and dropped his pen\nimmediately.\n\n\n" I just want to know why you are quitting."

And then I cringed.\n\n\nI had accidentally rubbed my upper and lower front teeth together and\nthe friction was just too much for me to take.\n\n\nI was beginning to feel like I was being interrogated.\n\n\nThe braces were torture.\n\n\n" Tell me frankly Bam," Philip looked more and more like a vulture.\n\n\n" The reason you are quitting."\n\n\n" If...you really want to know the truth, well, I just got feddup,\nthat\'s all," I sniped.\n\n\n" Why?\n\n\nPeople get feddup for reasons.\n\n\nEither they cannot take the pressure because of too much work, or\nthey don\'t like their bosses or colleagues, or their pay is too low..."\n\n\nI almost said it was none of the above but no sound came from my open\nmouth.\n\n\nI realized I had actually yawned.\n\n\nHe looked at me and smiled.\n\n\n" Didn\'t sleep well last night?"\n\n\nI wanted to tell him that the pain in my mouth due to the new braces\nkept me awake all night.\n\n\nBut he continued: " Now we all get feddup about things in life once\nin a while.\n\n\nBut these are things that keep us live, on our toes, and continually\nwanting to be alive.\n\n\nNow, life is too short to let these little things upset the balance.\n\n\nYou are what, 27 or 28?"\n\n\n" 27."\n\n\n" You are still young.\n\n\nAt your age, I was feddup with a lot of things too.\n\n\nMoney problems, family problems, girlfriend problems, etcetera, but I\nheld on.\n\n\nI am 43 now, and the only thing I regret was never having spent\nenough time on the physical side.\n\n\nI wish I exercised; at least I wouldn\'t have so many problems with my\nhealth nowadays."\n\n\nAt that point I felt the barrier was down and I could talk about\nanything with him.\n\n\n" I need some time to do a bit of soul-searching, I guess." I\nconfided.\n\n\nHe was probably taken aback by my sudden frankness, as he took off\nhis thick glasses, placed them on the table and sat back with both his hands\nbehind his head.\n\n\n" I mean, try to find myself, a voice...." I suddenly felt stupid.\n\n\nThis guy probably had travelled the same path before.\n\n\nI suddenly felt I had shrunk.\n\n\n" Soul-searching.\n\n\nIs there such a thing?" he said with a knowing glint in his eyes.\n\n\nMaybe he was right.\n\n\nMaybe he was the wise, old man after all.\n\n\nThe phone rang.\n\n\n" Mr Lim, Stanley is here to see you with the new interviewee." It\nwas Julie again.\n\n\n" Send them in."\n\n\nI got up and smiled at Philip and we shook hands.\n\n\nThe door opened and Stanley walked in with this fresh-looking guy\nwith greased hair - not a strand out of place.\n\n\nThe new guy also had the most brilliant tie in the room.\n\n\n" Okay, nice talking to you, Bam," Philip said as he stood up.\n\n\n" All the best for your future."\n\n\nI strolled past Stanley, who smiled professionally at me, but steered\nhis attention almost immediately towards the new guy.\n\n\nA new programmer, I reckoned.\n\n\n" Please, sit down and make yourself comfortable" was the last thing\nI heard behind the closing door.\n\n\nMy tongue wandered round the little square brackets held by the\nsilver wires on my teeth.\n\n\nYou bet it hurt. \n\n\n\n\n Free Falling \n\n\nI sat alone on the inside of the semi-circular bar counter, feeling\nthis strange serenity as I admired the fanciful liquor bottles.\n\n\nWhat is it, I wondered, that went into each and every one of them\nthat makes most men, myself included, lose our minds, each of the bottles\nbringing different sensations.\n\n\nOr drunkenness.\n\n\nIn the giant mirror behind the liquor bottles, my sober reflection\nstared back at me.\n\n\nThe mirror reminded me of scenes from movies where the mirrors at\nthe bar get smashed, either by a baddie being thrown by the handsome\nprotagonist ( usually Clint Eastwood or lately, Emilio Estevez) or by a\nseries of bullets.\n\n\nUsually, the barmen were lucky, as they ducked to avoid the mayhem.\n\n\nBut this barman staring back at me from the mirror was not so\nfortunate exactly four months ago.\n\n\nThat was when my fall started.\n\n\nMy wry smile in the mirror let the silver glint of my braces escape.\n\n\nThe orthodontist had done a pretty good job so far and I could see\nthe results, slowly but positively.\n\n\nPainfully.\n\n\nThe pain came from my heart too.\n\n\nEvery time I thought about my teeth, I was reminded of my\nunpardonable stupidity in causing the accident that could very well have\nruined my life.\n\n\nAnd Edie\'s too.\n\n\nDeservedly, I got punished.\n\n\nThe flash of the metallic linings reminded me of the time I came to\ngrief - when my car tried climbing a lamp-post at 40 km/h.\n\n\nI was saved by the safety belt which held my body back; only my\nupper and lower front teeth hit the steering wheel.\n\n\nAmazingly, they did not fall off on the spot; there was some\nblood-letting and a few teeth went askew and threatened to disengage from my\ngums.\n\n\nEdie, the sole passenger, was unscratched, although the shock must\nhave sparked off something in her, as she started calling me an irresponsible\ndriver.\n\n\nThe stupid little argument we were having on male chauvinism versus\nfeminism just before impact wasn\'t quite over.\n\n\n" Look what you\'ve done!\n\n\nJust take a look!\n\n\nYou can\'t even drive properly!\n\n\nYou want to kill me is it?"\n\n\nFor a moment there, she lost her usually suffocating verbosity.\n\n\nThen, she just broke down and cried.\n\n\nIt was one of the worst moments of my life - there I was, still\nfeeling slightly starry around my head and painful around my mouth, and this\nsilly woman beside me was crying and cursing me.\n\n\nSomething in me snapped and I did what I never knew I could.\n\n\nI got out of the car, opened the door on her side, dragged her out\nand, in front of the slowly forming crowd, I slapped her.\n\n\nShe just fell flat onto the ground, still weeping like an idiot.\n\n\nOf course I got hell for my careless behaviour from Edie\'s parents,\nas well as Dad, even though the car was registered in my name.\n\n\nBut the real shocker came when I realized the insurance for the car\nhad expired two weeks before the accident.\n\n\nI have always prided myself on being a very careful person when it\ncomes to money matters, like keeping enough funds in the bank for the\nmonth-end Giro deductions, making sure I updated my savings bank book\nregularly, like every five or six days, and practicing other equally paranoid\nbehaviour.\n\n\nBut for being forgetful with just that one little update, I was\npunished.\n\n\nThat slip showed my state of mind during that phase of my life.\n\n\nThe incident was the last straw for me, ending a long string of\nnerve-racking frustrations that had built up since I left the institutional\nshrine of higher learning and joined the equally venerated shrine of\nCorporate Singapore almost three years ago.\n\n\nI threw in the towel in almost every aspect of my life: I quit my\njob, sold the car, told my bewildered friends and colleagues I was going to\ncommit suicide, and stopped seeing Edie.\n\n\nThe accident seemed to have caused our relationship to end (\nnaturally so), and we saw less of each other after the police report (\nnaturally so too).\n\n\nI will always remember the look on Stanley\'s face when I told him I\nwanted to quit the job.\n\n\nThat was horrible.\n\n\nHe blew his top ( not that there was much left) and actually called\nmy move \'harum-scarum\'; he claimed with my qualifications, I couldn\'t have\nfound a better-paying job in the market.\n\n\nHe was right, as I had quit without the security of a new job - I\nlaughed all the way out of the bank when I went to collect my last pay\ncheque.\n\n\nI knew he said all that - because he needed me.\n\n\nWhen I left the job, the computer network system I was working on\nwas infested with horrible COBOL bugs and I was one of the few who had worked\non it from the very start ( the system study phase, they called it).\n\n\nBut I told him I was feddup ( I had difficulty pronouncing the \'f\').\n\n\nI told him I had reached the point of saturation.\n\n\nIt was obvious he didn\'t understand, and to him, I was to become a\nquitter, a loser in life.\n\n\nI thought I could never be like him - I didn\'t have his expensive,\nbrilliant ties, his vinyl black Bee-M-double-U and I admired his\nrelentlessness.\n\n\nMaybe that was why he was the lnformation System Manager of the\ncompany and I was contented to be just a 9 to 5 office worker along Shenton\nWay.\n\n\nFor my last squeeze, I called up my three insurance agents to change\nmy mode of payment from monthly to yearly, and that meant more than half my\nsavings being used up. \n\n\nBut at least I would not have to worry about insurance payments if\nany financial setbacks emerged in the near future.\n\n\nLike I said, I am good with money matters.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '177acd05-03f1-4a99-93df-92bb7ae96994', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.865610+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9874984622001648, 'non_english_score': 0.012501537799835205}
{'text': 'IN SPIRIT BOUND \n\n\nTHERE she stood now.\n\n\nTypical of her profession erect and proud.\n\n\nIt would seem that nothing could lick that military spirit which her\nyears in uniform had built into her system.\n\n\nIt was this indomitable spirit which had attracted me and many others\nto look longingly at her majestic tall figure - made all the more beautiful\nby her waist length hair.\n\n\nHer very dark complexion - very dark even for one of Indian ethnic\norigin - threw a mystic air around her.\n\n\nBut what made one swoon - if indeed one may swoon over a woman - was\nthe flash of pearly white teeth that she generously bestowed on her friends.\n\n\nNow after a year of widowhood the enchanting smile seemed to have gone\nforever.\n\n\nIt was as if she had aged a decade this past year.\n\n\nYet it seemed but yesterday that I had first seen her in her father\'s\nhouse - romping around without a care, filling the air with peals of rippling\nlaughter, as if she were a child who had forgotten to grow up.\n\n\nFrom where I stood I could see her; engrossed in her chosen task -\npulling out tuft after tuft of grass from her beloved\'s grave.\n\n\nShe only paused in her task and got to her feet to see where her\nlittle one had wandered to.\n\n\nAs I watched silently, her eyes wandered around to see who else had\ncome to this most desolate of places.\n\n\nI lamented that those once beautiful eyes had lost their lustre and\nin their place was a hopelessness that I had hoped I would never have to see\n- ever.\n\n\nYet she carried herself with the dignity and pride of the army woman\nthat she was.\n\n\nStanding tall and erect, her dark figure a stark contrast to the\nwidow\'s white saree that custom had condemned her to wear forever.\n\n\nKalyani\'s search ended when her eyes met her daughter\'s.\n\n\nLittle Leela looked up from where she was intently studying a\ntombstone.\n\n\nShe flashed a smile, exactly the smile that her mother had used to\nbrighten many of my mornings, and pointed her chubby finger at a flower.\n\n\nIn this most desolate of places neither the flower nor even the\nchild\'s smile brought the slightest cheer - at least not to my beloved\nKalyani.\n\n\nThe sluggish hot breeze brought with it the stench of rotting flesh\nfrom somewhere - probably from the stream nearby, where rain water had\ncollected after it had sunk into the ground and washed particles of rotting\nflesh.\n\n\nThe merging of the smell of the numerous frangipani flowers and the\nsickly sweet smell of the rotting corpses added an air of sadness that\ndominated the atmosphere - that even the child\'s smile failed to add any\ncheer.\n\n\nI spotted him first, as he picked his way gingerly over the\ngravestones towards where Kalyani was now, back at her toil, pulling the\ntufts of grass that offended her Raj\'s grave.\n\n\nAs I had expected, it was Narayan, Kalyani\'s self-appointed guardian.\n\n\nHe had as usual been following her since the tragedy in her life.\n\n\nThis he had been doing, sometimes with her knowledge, but mostly\nwithout.\n\n\nI had noticed her showing resentment at this silent escort service at\nfirst, but she had obviously learnt to be comfortable with the lanky,\nuninvited companion.\n\n\nLately I noticed that she even missed him a little on the few\noccasions when he was not around.\n\n\nI caught her looking around as if casually trying to hide the anxiety\nshe felt at discovering that he was not around.\n\n\nHe lived on the same floor as she did, so it was easy for him to\nfollow her at short notice, which he did, keeping at a respectable distance.\n\n\nOf course he had to protect her reputation.\n\n\nThe Indian community, even in Singapore, was quick to form\nconclusions and condemn \'misbehaviour\'.\n\n\nProfessional \'radios\' would have concocted fantastic stories about\nthem.\n\n\nThe stories would have begun by reports that they had been seen\ntogether, and developed to reports that they were living together and\nconcluded that this had been going on even when her husband had been alive!\n\n\n" You stupid bastard!" I heard her curse, and winced.\n\n\n" Why did you leave me?\n\n\nSee how lost I am without you?\n\n\nYou rushed into my life and before I had enough of you, rushed out.\n\n\nI warned you not to drink and drive, didn\'t I?" Tears flowed\nunrestrainedly and rained down on the desolate grave.\n\n\nI was able to feel just how anguished she was at this time.\n\n\nSo close had I been to her that even her thoughts were not secret\nfrom me.\n\n\nI remembered her favourite song, " When I see tears in your eyes,\nKannamma my heart bleeds for you" and my heart bled for her.\n\n\nShe was now beating the grave in despair and screaming unspeakable\ncurses at her one-time beloved, who had so suddenly left her all alone.\n\n\n" You promised to send me first, didn\'t you?" She screamed, not\ncaring who heard her.\n\n\n" He wouldn\'t approve," said a voice gently.\n\n\nShe did not look behind since she knew who it was.\n\n\n" He would want you to remember him but not lament his loss forever.\n\n\nIf you remember, he always loved laughter.\n\n\nHe would want you to be happy always."\n\n\n" You and your bloody advice!" She turned to him with a snarl, " He\nwas your best friend, wasn\'t he?\n\n\nWhy didn\'t you stop him from drinking?\n\n\nNo, you drank with him.\n\n\nNow you console his widow!\n\n\nGet lost and allow me at least the freedom to cry as much as I like."\nRational people do not like to see grown men cry, and I was a rational person\nand I did not like to see Narayan cry.\n\n\nAnd he was sobbing like a baby.\n\n\nMy God, what a scene!\n\n\nI would have liked to have been spared this heart-rending drama.\n\n\nBut who can escape his Karma...?\n\n\nSuddenly I felt a dig in my ribs.\n\n\nNaturally I knew who it was.\n\n\nIt was that little pest, Radha, again.\n\n\nI had met her in my wanderings, and had taken an instant liking to\nher and she to me.\n\n\nIn fact she had adopted me as her elder brother.\n\n\nShe was a childish 18-year old, full of life and mischief.\n\n\nShe had an irritating habit of sneaking up on me and doing suddenly\nsomething to attract attention.\n\n\nThis time it was an irritating tickle in the ribs.\n\n\nAt other times she would creep up quietly and yell, " Boo!", At\nanother time she would clap loudly in my ear and at another...oh heck!\n\n\nThe dig in the ribs was followed by the usual warm hug by way of an\napology.\n\n\nShe took one look at the scene and winked understandingly.\n\n\nThen she took my hand in hers and gripped it gently, and through this\nexpressed her sympathy, regret, happiness, sorrow everything!\n\n\nI gripped her hand in return to express my thanks at her perfect\nunderstanding of this delicate situation.\n\n\nBy now, Kalyani had taken a grip of herself and was wiping away her\ntears.\n\n\nNarayan was off on one of his philosophical trips.\n\n\nHe was explaining to her about the impermanence of life, the\nunreality of death et cetera.\n\n\nThe bored look on her face left no doubt as to her complete\ndisinterest in the subject.\n\n\nI remembered that Narayan was clumsy in everything - in action and in\nspeech.\n\n\nMoreover he never did know when and what to say.\n\n\nAs though to wave aside his philosophising, she asked with typical\nmilitary abruptness, " Why do you keep following me around?" Obviously\nannoyed at the sudden interruption to his well-meaning advice, and caught\noff-guard by the direct question, he stood stunned for a whole minute; and\nthen taking a grip on himself asked quietly, " You don\'t know?"

{'text': 'EIGHT YEARS TOO LATE \n\n\nI HAD never dreamt I would ever return again, like a repentant little\nboy who discovered that camping out under the starry sky was actually a damp\nand eerie experience.\n\n\nInconvenience and loneliness, but mostly loneliness, made me think of\nhome.\n\n\nI longed for the curry chicken which Lian Ying used to make every\nTuesday; how I loved those huge pieces of meat, tender and cooked to a\nperfect spiciness.\n\n\nI wanted to taste again the delicious ginseng soup, brewed for hours\nto extract the magical goodness of that mystical herb.\n\n\nI missed the steaming tub of water which used to wait for me at the\nend of a long exhausting day.\n\n\nIt was a wet August morning while sitting alone at my usual table in\nAh Tong\'s coffee-shop in China Street that I suddenly felt an enormous sense\nof loss and I knew that it was time for me to go home.\n\n\nI had been there for about three hours, sipping cup after cup of milky\ntea and munching groundnuts.\n\n\nThe shop looked shabbier and more dreary than ever and the cracked\nmarble table was cold to the touch.\n\n\nAfter the last of the morning crowd had left, Ah Tong came and sat\ndown with me.\n\n\nHe was a hefty fellow with a pock-marked face and irregular, stained,\ndirty, yellow, brown and black teeth.\n\n\nHis hair, streaked with grey and white, hung stiffly and his\nbloodshot eyes darted around like frightened little rabbits.\n\n\nHe was my only friend.\n\n\n" I\'m going home," I said He looked at me, surprised.\n\n\nPerhaps it was the emotional tone of my voice which told him that\nthis time, I meant going home to my family and not to that rented little room\nabove the video shop.\n\n\nHome, I thought with bitter irony.\n\n\n" Home?" he asked.\n\n\nI thought of the room which had been my home for the past few months.\n\n\nIt was my latest find and cost me eight dollars a day.\n\n\nI had shifted so many times in the past eight years that I had\nstopped counting.\n\n\nOn hot nights, the room would buzz with fierce mosquitoes and all\nkinds of noisy insects.\n\n\nWhen it rained, water leaked in through the cracks between the window\nframes and the wall where pieces of concrete and bricks had fallen off.\n\n\nIt made the wooden floor wet and filled air with dankness.\n\n\n" Yes, I think I have to go home," I said firmly.\n\n\nHe looked at me with a sort of contemptuous sympathy mixed with a\nlittle admiration.\n\n\n" It\'s your choice." He stood up and limped to the enormous counter\nwhere a row of huge glass bottles always stood.\n\n\nChildren visiting the shop would buy Chinese biscuits and pastries in\nthese containers and parents seldom left without buying some.\n\n\nAh Tong\'s bad left leg was the result of a stray shrapnel which\npierced through the kneecap, shattering it like a fragile glass ornament and\nleaving millions of pieces of broken bones lodged in the surrounding flesh.\n\n\nAnaesthetists were scarce in those days so the doctor had dug the\npieces out amidst his agonising screams right in the middle of the crazy war.\n\n\nAh Tong was not much of a talker.\n\n\nHe told me the story only once but I could neither forget the\nanguished look on his face nor the pure terror in his eyes, nor the way he\nhad shuddered at the memories that still haunted him.\n\n\nHe brought a pack of cards from the drawer where he kept his ledgers.\n\n\n" A game?" " Sure," I said.\n\n\nI wondered if it would be our last.\n\n\nI finished the remaining groundnuts, dusted my shirt and threw the\nshells into the chamber-pot under the table.\n\n\nAh Tong sat down opposite me and took out a squashed packet of\ncigarettes.\n\n\nHe offered one to me.\n\n\n" She\'ll be surprised." He spoke with a cigarette held between his\nlips.\n\n\nI shrugged.\n\n\nLian Ying was seldom surprised by anything.\n\n\nShe had a unnerving calmness about her that sometimes offended me.\n\n\nI was a rather jumpy sort of person.\n\n\nWe played three games of bridge before I finally told myself I had to\ngo immediately or my nerves would fail me and I would never even dare to\nthink of going home again.\n\n\nWhat if Lian Ying were to slam the door in my face?\n\n\nThat would be the ultimate shame, but somehow, I knew she would never\ndo that.\n\n\nShe was not the spiteful sort.\n\n\nPerhaps that was why I had decided to return.\n\n\nPerhaps I still loved her.\n\n\nPerhaps I needed her.\n\n\n" I must get going," I said Ah Tong gathered the heap of cards and\nseemed engrossed in arranging it.\n\n\n" Maybe I\'ll see you again sometime." " Sure.\n\n\nI\'ll be around.\n\n\nYou\'ll see me." He turned away and threw the pack of cards onto the\ncounter.\n\n\nThen he stood up and went to the door leading to the wash-room\nbehind.\n\n\nI caught a glimpse of his face and thought I saw a pained expression\nin his eyes.\n\n\nHe looked like he was going to cry.\n\n\nWhat a shame, I said to myself, but at the same time I was pleased\nand felt infinitely important and wonderful.\n\n\nA strange sense of love flooded the inside of me.\n\n\nAt least someone was sorry to see me leave.\n\n\nThere were three cigarettes left in the box.\n\n\nI took one and lighted it.\n\n\nThen I took out a ten-dollar note and stuffed it in with the\nremaining cigarettes.\n\n\nI waited another five minutes, puffing rings of smoke expertly up to\nthe ceiling but Ah Tong did not appear.\n\n\nFinally, I stubbed the cigarette out in the bright blue aluminium ash\ntray and left the shop.\n\n\nOn the way, I stopped at Lau Fatt Kee, a famous Chinese pastry shop,\nand bought a steamed pork bun, four egg tarts and four fried yam puffs.\n\n\nI thought of my son, Tien De, who was a very intelligent boy.\n\n\nHe would be turning fifteen the following month.\n\n\nI missed him.\n\n\nThe imminent encounter made me nervous and suddenly, I felt hungry.\n\n\nAs I got onto the bus, I started on the pork bun.\n\n\nWhen the bus reached that familiar street where I had had my home for\nseven years, I stumbled off hurriedly.\n\n\nI sat down on one of the seats although it was wet, and tried to calm\ndown.\n\n\nMy heart was palpitating.\n\n\nI ate two of the yam puffs and tried to stop my hands from shaking.\n\n\nPerhaps that was a sign of my sincerity.\n\n\nYes, perhaps I longed for my family.\n\n\nYes, perhaps I really wanted to go home.\n\n\nClouds had begun to gather again and hung threateningly low in the\nsky.\n\n\nI had to wait for another few minutes before I built up enough\ncourage to get up and cross the street.\n\n\nI was finally going home.\n\n\nI had not seen them for eight years.\n\n\nI wondered if my son still remembered me.\n\n\nHe had been only seven when I left.\n\n\nDuring all those years in between, I had not really bothered to find\nout anything or to visit.\n\n\nHad I been busy?\n\n\nI never had very much to do anyway except to go out for a nightly\ndrink at Ah Tong\'s, and occasionally relieve my physical needs with one or\ntwo willing young ladies.\n\n\nI stood outside the dark panelled door, my forefinger poised in\nmid-air ready to press the door-bell.\n\n\nI hesitated.\n\n\nThousands of frightening images played through my mind.\n\n\nWould they take me back again?\n\n\nWould my son ever accept me as his father?\n\n\nAfter all, I had never been around for him when he was growing up.\n\n\nWhat right did I have to ask for anything of him or his mother?\n\n\nFinally, I rang the bell.\n\n\nA low melodious tune sounded softened by the thickness of the door,\nand I stood waiting, the paper-bag with the tidbits still in my hand.\n\n\n" Who\'s that?" The sound of her voice hit me like a wave.\n\n\nIt had been a long time.\n\n\nToo long.\n\n\nHer voice was not as shrill as I remembered; there was now a softer,\nsubtler edge to it.\n\n\nI thought to myself how sweet it sounded and then grieved at my own\nsentimentality.\n\n\nHow I missed her.\n\n\nIn all the eight years we were separated, I had never admitted it.\n\n\nNot even to myself.\n\n\nIt would have been too painful.\n\n\nIt would have bruised my stupid male ego.\n\n\nA man who wanted to enjoy freedom had to give it up for some of the\nthings that family offered.\n\n\nI had had my share of freedom.\n\n\nLian Ying had always been good to me.\n\n\nI knew that.\n\n\nI just did not realise how good.\n\n\nHer love was generous, unlike me.\n\n\nSo how was I suppose to answer?\n\n\nAgain, I hesitated.\n\n\n" Who\'s that?" " Ah Ying..." I stopped.\n\n\nThe seconds seemed to drag on forever.\n\n\nIn that eternity, I recalled the birth of our son and the radiant\nlook of joy on her face as the nurse placed the tiny bawling bundle into her\narms.\n\n\nI remembered that exhilarating sense of pride I had felt as I held\nthe frail little creature, still bright red from the trauma of coming into\nthis world.\n\n\nI saw again the excitement that had made her face glow when I\nsuggested having a family portrait taken at the Broadway Photo Studio, one of\nthe most famous in those days.\n\n\nLittle fragments of the most insignificant things in our lives\ndanced in my head.\n\n\nSuch precious memories.\n\n\nThe door swung open slowly.\n\n\nShe seemed to have changed very little.\n\n\nShe wore her air short now, a boyish cut which suited her well.\n\n\n" Is that really you, Ah Hung?" She stared at me for a moment,\nincredulous.\n\n\nAnd then, recovering quickly from the shock, she smiled and invited\nme in.\n\n\n" Ah Tien is not back from school yet.\n\n\nI\'ll get you a cup of tea.\n\n\nSit down and make yourself comfortable." " Ah Ying..."\n\n\nShe turned towards me and our eyes met.\n\n\nMillions of different thoughts ran through my mind.\n\n\nConfused, I hastily handed her the paper bag I was holding.\n\n\n" Here are some tidbits for you and Ah Tien," I said.\n\n\n" I bought some of your favourite egg-tarts from Lau Fatt Kee.\n\n\nI don\'t know what Ah Tien likes, really, so I got some yam puffs\ntoo.\n\n\n" Oh, you shouldn\'t have spent all the money." An awkward silence\nfell between us.\n\n\nI knew I had to tell her now.\n\n\nI had to tell her how sorry I was to have abandoned them; how sorry\nI was to have betrayed her love, our love; how sorry I was to have failed as\na husband to her and as a father to our son.\n\n\nBut I did not.\n\n\nWe made small talk.\n\n\nTrivial matters.\n\n\nShe now had another job, she told me, as a marketing consultant with\na local firm.\n\n\nTien De was doing quite well in school, she said, but he had\nasthmatic attacks and so could not participate in many sporting activities.\n\n\nHe went for violin lessons twice a week, he was crazy about cars and\ncollected coins.\n\n\nHe liked mango ice-cream and peanut-butter, and hated steamed\nchicken and carrots.\n\n\nI told her about my eight years, the little incidents, the\noccasional events.\n\n\nShe invited me to stay and I accepted.\n\n\nNothing was mentioned about the hurt and the betrayal.\n\n\nI did not ask for forgiveness.\n\n\nShe did not accuse me of unfaithfulness.\n\n\nWe spent the afternoon shopping.\n\n\nIn my haste, I had not brought any clothing with me so I bought a\nnew holdall, a Dr West toothbrush, a Philips shaver, a face towel, two\nshirts, and a T-shirt and a pair of blue boxer shorts to sleep in.\n\n\nThat evening, I met my son.\n\n\nAh Ying was peeling some shallots and I was nibbling a piece of\npeanut crunch when he bounced into the kitchen.\n\n\n" Hi, Mom," he cried as he dropped his knapsack onto the kitchen\nfloor. \n\n\nHe stopped and looked at me curiously.\n\n\n" Hi," he said and smiled.\n\n\n~Hi," I greeted in return. by Carol Loh', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '85fb7882-5fc9-4c63-a12b-127b4c61f8c3', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.868034+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9923025965690613, 'non_english_score': 0.007697403430938721}

Blanchkar vowed aloud, his fists clenched and\nhis eyes shone with revenge.\n\n\nAt this, his men chanted: " Down with Zandal!\n\n\nLong live King Blanchkar!\n\n\nLong live the Black Arts!" The crimson sun hovered over the crest of\nthe hill, its light driving away the dark of night.\n\n\nA warm breeze dispersed the mist which blanketed the fields.\n\n\nDew drops set on the plants reflecting the sunlight.\n\n\nFrom afar, the fields seemed to be a sea of diamonds.\n\n\nThe plants were obviously precious to the people of Aztam Village,\nlike diamonds, for no sooner had mist dispersed, people were trudging into\nthe fields to tend to the plants.\n\n\nThey needed these plants for survival.\n\n\nOnly they gave them life.\n\n\nFor this reason, the plants were known as Life Plants.\n\n\n" Careful with that plant, young man," Joam, the Chief Tender, called\nout to a young man working at the edge of the fields.\n\n\n" The name\'s Lightor, Sir!" the lad replied.\n\n\n" I think something\'s wrong with this plant."\n\n\nJoam frowned as he walked over, gesturing Lightor to stand aside and\nsquatting down to have a closer look at the Life Plant.\n\n\n" Hmm... purple spots all over," he muttered.\n\n\n" can it be - "\n\n\n" Sir," Lightor cut in suddenly, his black eyes bursting with\nexcitement.\n\n\n" The plants are supposed to be green with big healthy leaves.\n\n\nThis one has purple spots and, and the leaves are - "\n\n\n" Getting smaller," Joam complete the sentence.\n\n\nHe knitted his bushy eyebrows together and stared at Lightor.\n\n\n" next time, don\'t break my thoughts.\n\n\nYou understand?" Lightor puffed up his red cheeks and looked down.\n\n\n" I\'m sorry, Sir.\n\n\nI got carried away." Joam patted Lightor\'s shoulder and smiled.\n\n\n" Run along now, and don\'t ever cross over the edge of the fields.\n\n\nBeware of the creatures of the Great Forest." Lightor\'s childish face\nlighted up.\n\n\n" Yes, Sir!"\n\n\nThe village of Aztam was surrounded by the Great Forest, rumoured to\nbe inhabited by the evil creatures created by practitioners of the Black\nArts.\n\n\nBut, no one had ever seen any of those creatures, nor did anyone wish\nto.\n\n\nSince the ancient war between the Sorcerers and the Naturalists, the\nland of Khalabar had been thrown into chaos.\n\n\nThe Sorcerers who believed in magic as a way of life, lost in the\nvital battle of Zurax and were banished forever.\n\n\nHence, the Naturalists who advocated living with and improving on\nwhat Nature provided ruled this land.\n\n\nThe afternoon sun scorched the fields where the villagers settled\ndown to have lunch.\n\n\nPlucking a leaf carefully, Lightor brought it to his mouth.\n\n\n" Hmm...delicious," he muttered.\n\n\n" Two more to go."\n\n\nJust as he was going to pluck the next leaf, he felt a pat on his\nshoulder.\n\n\nHe turned around to see his friend, Fatsot.\n\n\n" Hi, Lightor," Fatsot said, grinning.\n\n\n" Mind if I eat one of your leaves."\n\n\n" Yes, I do.\n\n\nYou are fat enough as it is.\n\n\nAnd, don\'t you ever forget the three for one rule.\n\n\nOne person, three leaves for all meals."\n\n\n" Sure, I remember," Fatsot said as he patted his bulging belly.\n\n\n" I even know the story behind it.\n\n\nAnd, I\'ll tell you if you\'ll let me have one of your leaves.\n\n\nWell?"\n\n\nAt this, Lightor smiled a half smile, his eyes brightening up.\n\n\nHe was always a sucker for stories, especially weird ones.\n\n\n" Okay, tell me."\n\n\n" A long time ago, there was this great eater in the village, see.\n\n\nHe ate a lot of leaves and almost caused a famine.\n\n\nSo, to stop the tragedy from happening again, the rule was imposed."\n\n\n" And, what happened to that guy?"\n\n\n" Well, he ate so much that he burst just like that." Fatsot snapped\nhis fingers to emphasize the burst.\n\n\n" Interesting," Lightor said as he plucked two more leaves from the\nplant.\n\n\n" But, I\'m too old to believe you."\n\n\nSo saying, he pushed the leaves into his mouth and munched away.\n\n\n" Hey!\n\n\nYou cheated!" Fatsot\'s face burnt with anger.\n\n\n" You, wild child of the orphanage!\n\n\nLucky for you, your parents died early, or I\'ll tell on you!"\n\n\n" Ha!\n\n\nCatch me if you can!"\n\n\nFatsot lunged at Lightor, his chubby arms poised to squeeze every\nblood out of him.\n\n\nLightor side-stepped and jabbed him in the stomach.\n\n\nFatsot groaned in pain.\n\n\n" Now, I\'ll show you how I lift a five hundred-pound fool!" Lightor\ngrabbed Fatsot by the waist and swung him over his head.\n\n\nAt sixteen, Lightor was as strong as any King\'s knight, if not\nstronger.\n\n\n" Help!\n\n\nOh, help!"\n\n\nLightor looked up at the sagging bottom of Fatsot.\n\n\nNo, it was not from him.\n\n\nA scan at the fields edge revealed two men in rags running away from\na manlike creature which towered eight feet tall.\n\n\nJust a dozen paces away from the edge, Lightor ran with Fatsot over\nhis head towards the two men.\n\n\n" Hey, Lightor!\n\n\nAre you crazy?\n\n\nThe thing\'ll crush the two of us!" Fatsot\'s voice was almost\nhysterical.\n\n\n" Not if you crush him first, buddy boy!"\n\n\nWith the two men safely behind Lightor, the creature was only a few\npaces away from him.\n\n\nIts eyes shone in a fiery red aura.\n\n\n" Okay, Fatsot.\n\n\nClose your eyes and think that you\'re landing on lots of leaves."\nLightor breathed in deeply and with a war cry, slammed Fatsot at the\ncreature.\n\n\nFatsot landed on the creature with a boom which reverberated across\nthe village.\n\n\nThe creature roared in pain and vanished.\n\n\n" Oh, thank you!\n\n\nThank you!" the shorter of the two men hugged Lightor in gratitude.\n\n\n" I\'m Dirkoff and this is Grougar."\n\n\nThe man called Grougar bowed slightly, his right hand over his chest\nand his eyes always on Lightor.\n\n\n" Pleased to meet you."\n\n\nBy now, a big crowd had gathered at the edge of the fields.\n\n\nA short man with partially bald head came forward with Joam by his\nside.\n\n\n" I\'m the Village Head," he introduced himself to the two men.\n\n\n" My name\'s Dave.\n\n\nWhat happened?" " We are from the village of Jodar," Grougar began,\nhis wolflike eyes blinking as a wind blew across the fields.\n\n\n" The Sorcerers had attacked our village.\n\n\nWe were fortunate enough to escape the massacre as we were out\nfishing then.\n\n\nAnd - "\n\n\n" Fishing?" Lightor eyed Grougar curiously.\n\n\n" Oh.\n\n\nA rod and a line inside water with a bait and wait for a fish to\nbite," Dirkoff explained eagerly.\n\n\n" A fish is an animal that lives in water."\n\n\n" Oh?" Lightor sounded surprised.\n\n\n" How come we\'ve never heard of fishing here?"\n\n\n" It\'s because all of you live in the inner land.\n\n\nIn the outer land, you\'ll see lakes and ponds teeming with ashes.\n\n\nAnd, lakes and ponds contain - " " Water." Lightor smiled smugly,\nglad that he knew the answer.\n\n\n" Hold it, Lightor." Joam stared at him, causing his stomach to\nknot.\n\n\n" Let him finish his story."\n\n\n" Knowing that your village is the nearest," Grougar continued, " we\nran into the Great Forest and made our way here.\n\n\nAt the edge, that troll confronted us.\n\n\nFortunately, Brother Lightor and the fat guy saved us."\n\n\n" What fat guy?\' Fatsot growled as he limped towards Grougar.\n\n\n" My name\'s Fatsot.\n\n\nAnd, where\'s that wild child?"\n\n\n" Right here, buddy boy," Lightor said, half grinning, half\ngiggling.\n\n\nJust as Fatsot stumbled towards Lightor for another fight, Joam\nstopped him.\n\n\n" Here are five leaves as a reward for driving the creature away.\n\n\nShake hand with Lightor and I\'ll let you eat them."\n\n\nFatsot smiled and shook Lightor\'s hand.\n\n\n" Friends?"\n\n\n" Friends."\n\n\n" Leaves?\n\n\nYou all eat leaves?" Dirkoff asked, his round eyes wide opened.\n\n\n" Yes," Joam replied.\n\n\n" We eat the leaves from these Life Plants for survival."\n\n\n" Strange.\n\n\nFrom where I come from, we eat grass.\n\n\nWe call them Strength Grass." Dave smiled.\n\n\n" That\'s why we are the Naturalists.\n\n\nWe are adapted to Nature\'s way of life." At the mention of \'Naturalists\',\nGrougar\'s eyes narrowed with an evil glint.\n\n\nLightor noticed that but dismissed it as an action to keep out the\ndust which was rifting in with the breeze.\n\n\nNight reigned.\n\n\nShadows danced in the fields under the pale moonlight as a warm\nbreeze brought in the mist.\n\n\nThe Field Guards with their shiny spears were pacing the fields,\ntheir eyes alert for any intruder.\n\n\nThe spears were obtained from the village of Kenk in past barter\ntrade.\n\n\nIn times of peace, trade among Naturalist villages were carried out\nmost earnestly.\n\n\nThey exchanged their products with one another and shared among\nthemselves the skills of forging, mining, farming, sewing, building, carving\nand many other useful skills.\n\n\nWith the outbreak of The War, every village had stopped trading and\nconcentrated only on its very own survival.\n\n\n" Say, buddy boy.\n\n\nThere\'s a cricket to your right,"\n\n\nLightor whispered, bringing a candle towards that spot.\n\n\n" Where?\n\n\nI don\'t see any."\n\n\n" Sh...Don\'t let the Field Guards hear you.\n\n\nOr, we\'ll be forced to eat crickets."\n\n\n" I know, I know," Fatsot said impatiently.\n\n\n" Where the hell is the cricket?"\n\n\n" It\'s gone.\n\n\nLet\'s search at the edge of the fields.\n\n\nI heard that the crickets there are great fighters."\n\n\nThe duo inched towards the edge of the fields, making sure to keep\ntheir heads lower than the four feet tall plants.\n\n\nThe squeegee mud squished and squashed under Fatsot\'s heavy limbs,\nleaving a flat trail behind for Lightor to follow.\n\n\n" Go a bit faster, buddy boy."\n\n\n" Wait.\n\n\nSh..."\n\n\n" What?"\n\n\n" Do you hear it?" There was a tinge of fear in Fatsot\'s voice.\n\n\n" Hear what?"\n\n\n" A sound.\n\n\nSomething like fire burning."\n\n\nLightor twitched his ears, trying to locate the source of the sound.\n\n\n" It\'s a dozen paces to our right.\n\n\nLet\'s take a look."\n\n\nLightor and Fatsot peeked out from behind the plants like a pair of\nprairie dogs scanning their surrounding from their mounds.\n\n\nBehind the curtain of mist, they saw something that caused a shiver\nto surge through their very being.\n\n\nA hooded figure hovered over a Field Guard, lightning bolts slammed\ninto the guard, turning him into ash.\n\n\n" It\'s, it\'s a Sorcerer.\n\n\nOh, my..."\n\n\n" Quiet, Fatsot.\n\n\nWe\'ve to inform the rest."\n\n\n" Eh, Lightor.\n\n\nI\'m going to, to..."\n\n\n" Belch?\n\n\nQuick, cover your mouth."\n\n\n" Sneeze too.\n\n\nA-tishoo!"\n\n\nLightor looked at Fatsot in horror, his eyes raging with fear.\n\n\nThe image of death flashed through his mind.\n\n\nHe had seen his parents die at the hands of the Sorcerers, and he\nwas not going to die like that.\n\n\nHe clenched his fists and sank his teeth into his lower lip.\n\n\nFor a moment, time froze.\n\n\n" Run for it!" Lightor shouted at the top of his voice and pulled\nFatsot with him.\n\n\nThe duo sped towards the village, their legs pounding the ground as\nfast as they could.\n\n\nThe Sorcerer took to the air and gave chase.\n\n\n" What the...We\'re running to the edge," Lightor panted.\n\n\n" Turn right to the village."\n\n\nLightor could feel his blood surging to his fast pumping heart.\n\n\nThe fear in his mind was no longer present, only the goal of\nreaching the village stood in his mind.\n\n\nA sudden explosion of hot air behind the duo sent them sprawling\nonto the ground.\n\n\nLightor shook his head violently and looked at the village.\n\n\nIt was gone!\n\n\n" Well," a witchlike voice cackled.\n\n\n" How do you like my illusion, Naturalists?" \n\n\n" Damn.\n\n\nI should have known."\n\n\nLightor punched the ground with his fist.\n\n\n" I warn you.\n\n\nYou better stay away from us."', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'fe188a66-09db-4555-a629-03a4f7f5635c', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.869590+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9832531809806824, 'non_english_score': 0.016746819019317627}
{'text': 'THE NATIONAL CELEBRATIONS \n\n\n1990\n\n\nThere were at least sixty-five thousand smartly-dressed people in the\nNational Stadium during that epoch-making afternoon.\n\n\nThe sun was beginning to dip into the far horizon.\n\n\nThe billowy clouds in the sky had kept the temperature low which was\nvery much appreciated by all in the National Stadium.\n\n\n" Do you really think that the PM ( referring to Prime Minister Lee\nKuan Yew) will really hand over the reins of power to Mr Goh Chok Tong\ntoday"?\n\n\nWhen and how the transfer of power will take place has been the topic\nof much heated discussion ever since Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had publicly\nstated that he would hand over power to Mr Goh Chok Tong end of 1990.\n\n\n" Today is an auspicious day".\n\n\nA mature masculine voice broke out.\n\n\n" Why, it is our 25th Anniversary.\n\n\nI hope Mr Goh Chok Tong will become our new Prime Minister today".\n\n\nFolding his hands, he looked as though he\'s deep in thought and\nappeared very educated.\n\n\nHe must have thought about this matter for some time.\n\n\nHe seemed to have his own good reasons for making his point of view\nheard.\n\n\nA middle-aged woman was heard in another part of the National Stadium\nwhen she spoke loudly ( to match her unexpectedly \'loud\' dress): " Ah yah,\nwhen is the ceremony going to start?\n\n\nI\'ve been here hours, still we are all waiting.\n\n\nWaiting for what?"\n\n\nShe sat up straight and solemn-faced as she tried to wipe off the\nperspiration from her forehead.\n\n\nThose near her were unusually patient that late afternoon.\n\n\nNormally, they\'d have joined her in blaming the organisers if the\norganisers hadn\'t been punctual.\n\n\nIt looks like Singaporeans are typically neurotic when it comes to\npunctuality, save at the wedding dinner party when they observe " rubber\ntime" - the time that stretches like rubber.\n\n\n" Today is special".\n\n\nSo said a young man looking relaxed.\n\n\nHe continued: " So, we must be patient.\n\n\nAfter all, it\'s still early," he intoned, surprised to find himself\nunusually patient.\n\n\nMany nodded their heads in agreement.\n\n\nThe middle-aged woman turned a deaf ear to the young man, tilting her\nchin slightly higher than the normal position.\n\n\nShe just looked away in another direction.\n\n\nFor no apparent reasons, quite spontaneously, strangers began to talk\nwith each other all over the National Stadium.\n\n\nMaybe, it\'s boredom caused by waiting.\n\n\nOr, maybe, it was due to the fact that they felt a need to talk.\n\n\nMany of them had harboured thoughts to themselves regarding the\ntransfer of power.\n\n\nNow they took the opportunity to verbalise them.\n\n\nNaturally, not a few were just re-stating what they had heard from\ncolleagues and friends.\n\n\nWhatever was the reason, many sensible statements were made and\nshared with the newly-found friends who were, moments ago, total strangers.\n\n\n" I believe Mr Goh Chok Tong will make a good successor to Prime\nMinister Lee Kuan Yew," asserted a Eurasian-looking man in his late thirties.\n\n\n" I\'ve heard on the grapevine that he has many fine ideas and\nprogrammes that he looks forward to carrying out when he becomes Prime\nMinister.\n\n\nAlso, for quite some time now, he has gotten together a good team of\nthinkers and planners who have solid ideas and plans to improve our living\nand working conditions".\n\n\nHe spoke like someone who had access to high-level planning.\n\n\nHis hands were resting on his hips and his shoulders were slumped\nwith the weight of what he was saying, so it seemed.\n\n\n" Of course, what else"?\n\n\nsaid a middle-aged man who was carrying his umbrella.\n\n\nHe looked like the type of person who\'s ever ready for any\neventuality.\n\n\nHe must have been a Boy Scout who had been conditioned to live up to\nthe well known motto: Be prepared.\n\n\n" After all, he has been well groomed by Lau Lee ( an endearing\nChinese way of addressing Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew).\n\n\nYou can safely assume that Lau Lee had done an excellent job".\n\n\nHe gave the impression that he was pontificating.\n\n\nNo one was to challenge his statement.\n\n\nNo one did, anyway.\n\n\n" That aside, Mr Goh Chok Tong must be assessed on his own merit.\n\n\nIf he didn\'t have fine leadership quality he\'d never have gained the\nattention of the PM and the co-operation of the younger leaders".\n\n\nA tall woman in her late twenties had joined in the conversation.\n\n\nShe\'s all softly-padded and Filofax in her tawny brown dress and gold\naccessories, with sunglasses to protect her eyes.\n\n\nThe people around her were quite surprised by her statement.\n\n\nShe looked younger than she was.\n\n\nA career woman, she has seen enough of the corporate world to know\nsomething of power-struggles and office politics.\n\n\nShe was there with her fiancée who looked equally yuppie.\n\n\nHe\'s one of those passionately dressed floor-movers, sporting a\nlong-sleeved black tee, tight tartan pants, and maroon velvet suspenders.\n\n\nHis sunglasses matched hers\'.\n\n\nThese yuppies want to look and act differently from the crowds, but\nend up as drably uniform as the rest of the pack.\n\n\nThey can be picked up easily from any crowd.\n\n\nSame attire.\n\n\nSame hairdo.\n\n\nSame watches and rings.\n\n\nEven same smiles.\n\n\nSama, sama ( Malay for same, same).\n\n\n" You, yuppies, all say the same things, lah," volunteered a youngish\nman.\n\n\n" Can\'t you be original"?\n\n\nhe frowned.\n\n\n" We may be yuppies, but don\'t forget that we\'ve both brains and\nbrawns," the career woman\'s fiancee said, coming to her rescue, clearly\nirritated by the young man\'s rude statement which he knew was meant to be\nannoying in the first place.\n\n\n" My fiancee was right in affirming that Mr Goh Chok Tong had passed\nall the assessments with flying colours.\n\n\nThe corporate world is very confident of his leadership".\n\n\nHe felt good to have joined in the conversation and was secretly\nrejoicing over his sensible speech.\n\n\nHe was proud of having vindicated his fiancee.\n\n\n" Ya, lah, I heard that the younger leaders are all raring to go.\n\n\nThey are eagerly awaiting for their turn to run our country.\n\n\nThat\'s what they say in my office".\n\n\nHe looked as though he had just completed his National Service\nbecause he still cut a trim figure.\n\n\nToo early in his career to get flabby because of excessive\nentertainment.\n\n\nThis young man was putting his future on the new younger leaders to\nlead Singapore through another twenty-five years of growth and prosperity.\n\n\n" I wonder how the minority groups will fare in the new line-up.\n\n\nWill they be given more leadership positions?\n\n\nWill Chok Tong have a Malay or an Indian as the First Deputy Prime\nMinister?\n\n\nI\'d love to know that".\n\n\nThis Indian man in his batik shirt was articulating the thoughts of\nmany Malays and Indians who have been asking this question quite anxiously.\n\n\n" I noticed that you addressed Mr Goh Chok Tong as \'Chok Tong\'.\n\n\nIs there any reason for this"?\n\n\nasked a man in his beige barong, matched by his beige sun visor.\n\n\nThe Indian man said quite frankly.\n\n\n" I guess it\'s my way of respecting a man by calling him by name,"\nnodding his head as he continued his short discourse.\n\n\n" It is not that I know him.\n\n\nIt is just my way of addressing him," smiling as he tapped his\nforehead in the way many Indians do.\n\n\nUnknown to the Indian man, countless Singaporeans, too, have already\nstarted to call Mr Goh Chok Tong simply as Chok Tong.\n\n\nIt\'s " Chok Tong this" and " Chok Tong that".\n\n\nIt has come as naturally to them as it had to their elders who\nformerly had addressed Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew simply as \'Lee Kuan Yew\'.\n\n\nFar from being disrespectful, it\'s a nice and natural way for them to\naddress their chosen leader in that personal manner.\n\n\nIt\'s also their way of showing their respect and confidence in their\nnew leader.\n\n\n" To change the subject, do you think that Singapore will have a\nsmooth sailing the next twenty-five years"?, biting his fingernails, a\nnervous-looking man asked.\n\n\nHe\'s anxious to know if his future would be trouble-free.\n\n\nThe national economy has been quite robust the last four years,\nhaving overcome the downward turn in 1986.\n\n\nThe spectre of that 1986 economic nose-dive hasn\'t quite\ndisappeared.\n\n\nRetrenchment, a 15% cut of the employers\' Central Provident Fund\ncontribution, lower wages, and difficulty in finding suitable jobs are still\nfresh in the psyche of many Singaporeans.\n\n\nTheir leaders have marvellously turned back the tide, and now they\nare basking in monetary glory once again.\n\n\nThe nervous-looking man wasn\'t alone in wishing to know if the next\ntwenty-five years would be trouble-free.\n\n\n" Hey, man, I\'m sure Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew must have mixed\nfeelings stepping down".\n\n\nThis man came prepared for the Celebrations and was properly attired\nin his formal Malay dress.\n\n\nHaving assumed that Singapore would have another twenty-five years\nof prosperity, he\'d deliberately not answered the nervous-looking man\'s\nquestion.\n\n\nRather, he felt justified in switching to another subject, viz.,\nPrime Minister Lee Kuan Yew\'s mixed feelings on stepping down.\n\n\nHe spoke each word carefully, though he gave the impression that\nhe\'s casual.\n\n\n" I believe you were right.\n\n\nNot just mixed feelings.\n\n\nIt must be very difficult for him to step down too.\n\n\nEspecially when he knows that there are still many people who would\nwant him to stay on.\n\n\nOf course, there are people who just can\'t wait to see him go.\n\n\nAll the same, the majority of Singaporeans would want him to\ncontinue.\n\n\nI believe you will see that sentiment today.\n\n\nJust wait and see.\n\n\nThe people here will show him that they do really want him to stay\non".\n\n\nFor a young woman, she spoke with authority and conviction.\n\n\nSurprisingly, too.\n\n\nAfter all, one\'d have thought that the young would prefer to see\nChok Tong in total control.\n\n\n" I was just thinking," butted in another woman, " if Mr Lee Kuan\nYew would feel sorry leaving his seat of power.\n\n\nAfter all, he\'s been in command for the last thirty-one years.\n\n\nAny human being would feel the loss of power in such a situation.\n\n\nWith the loss of power would be the loss of identity, one way or\nanother.\n\n\nMore than that, what would he do with his free time?\n\n\nI know that he\'s going to be around, but it won\'t be the same as\nbefore".\n\n\n" Yah, lah, it will be difficult for him.\n\n\nPoor soul.\n\n\nIf he helped too much, people will criticise him.\n\n\nIf he didn\'t help enough, people will also sabo ( local slang to\nmean \'sabotage\' or \'undermine\' in a critical way) him".\n\n\nA young lad in his late teens, sitting at the second level of the\nstaircase, had decided to join in.\n\n\nHe shook his head slowly and said: " Poor man, lah.\n\n\nOnly lose, no win".\n\n\nThis young lad might not be able to articulate his thoughts\ncarefully, but he wasn\'t ready to lose out by not making his contribution.\n\n\n" Chok Tong won\'t find his task easy-going, either.\n\n\nPrime Minister Lee Kuan Yew isn\'t going to be the only person who\nwill find the transition tough.\n\n\nChok Tong will find and experience similar problems.\n\n\nFor example, if he didn\'t consult his former boss and things go\nwrong, people will blame him.\n\n\nIf he consulted him too often, people will say that he\'s not his own\nboss.\n\n\nLike the Americans used to say: You\'re damned if you do; you\'re\ndamned if you don\'t.\n\n\nIt\'s a no-win situation for both leaders".\n\n\nAn old man who had kept quiet all along, at long last had said what\nmany thinking people have been saying quietly in their heart.\n\n\nIt is quite apparent that informed Singaporeans must have been doing\na great deal of thinking aloud.\n\n\nJudging from the kind of statements just mentioned, almost the whole\nof Singapore\'s population must have gone through some anxious moments during\nthis period of transition.\n\n\nThis seems to be confirmed by what\'s heard and said by Singaporeans.\n\n\n" I\'m 100% sure that Chok Tong will doubt, if he hasn\'t already\ndoubted, if he can succeed Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew successfully. \n\n\nAny person will tell you that succeeding the PM is truly a hard act\nto follow.\n\n\nThe PM\'s shadow will be hovering over Chok Tong all the time,\nobviously or not obviously.\n\n\nEven if the PM said nothing after stepping down, everyone can still\nhear him, one way or another.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'Singaporama \n\n\nWhat do you think your life would be like if you had\n&dollar;20 million in your bank accounts and owned a penthouse suite worth\n&dollar;10 million?\n\n\nIf your personal income was not less than\n&dollar;100,000 a month?\n\n\nIf you had other convertible assets worth more than\n&dollar;490 million?\n\n\nYou couldn\'t imagine it, could you?\n\n\nIt would be utterly inconceivable.\n\n\nFor Benny Weng it wasn\'t.\n\n\nHe was nauseated by the kind of life where money was no problem as far\nas his personal needs were concerned.\n\n\nFor many years he had driven himself almost to the breaking-point to\nreach the pinnacle.\n\n\nThe final goal seemed extremely hard to attain - still, he would give\nit a determined try, though now he was beginning to doubt whether it was\nworth the effort to be the richest man in Singapore.\n\n\nIt all boiled down to vanity, even madness.\n\n\nWhen he was a boy, his paternal grandfather told him that the\npost-war generation did not regard the pre-war big shots with awe and\nobsequiousness.\n\n\nEach generation viewed life differently.\n\n\nBenny was fond of reflecting on his life in patches, going rapidly\nforward and backward in time, as if time had a disjointed, perverted\ncontinuity, and he was central to its unity.\n\n\nLife here, he thought, was replete with lecturing.\n\n\nHe did it to people, and it seemed, more often, they to him.\n\n\nAfter all, in his view this was the way of life on the island in\nwhich he had been raised.\n\n\nSo hyper-rich was Benny that he didn\'t know what to do with his\nmoney.\n\n\nHe had grown tired of transacting landed property.\n\n\nBuying luxury motor cars and expensive personal items no longer had\nany fascination for him.\n\n\nThe more he had the more problems he encountered managing and\nsecuring what he owned.\n\n\nAs far as his personal acquisitions were concerned, he would never\nallow someone else to look after them for him.\n\n\nHe prided himself in being the super managing director, ranking in\nthe distinguished company of personalities like Iacocca, Morita and others in\nthat league.\n\n\nBeing the top man in more than a dozen companies was arduous, yet he\nwas able to keep them all ticking in the black.\n\n\nAlthough his wealth was comparable to that of the richest men in the\nWest, he somehow could not attract the same awe, respect or fame in his\nsociety.\n\n\nWhat was the recipe for his phenomenal success?\n\n\nIt could be glibly put as the possession of a business gene.\n\n\nHis other attributes completed the picture: shrewdness, acumen,\ndetermination, persistence, courage, endurance, awareness of human\npsychology, indefatigability and, above all, a penchant to succeed.\n\n\nHe took the trouble to keep abreast of market conditions: the latest\ncommercial information on tap kept him ahead of his rivals.\n\n\nhe did not tolerate indolence, incompetence or disloyalty on the part\nof his staff.\n\n\nHe balanced ruthless efficiency with ample reward for labour, firm\noverall control with managerial delegation, proprietary detachment with staff\ncamaraderie.\n\n\nHe was aware that he was more respected than loved by those who\nworked under him, more feared than admired.\n\n\nBelieving firmly that money talked, he set aside a generous slice of\nthe profits for his staff, paying them according to their productivity,\nencouraging them to buy shares in the companies he owned.\n\n\nThey had to slog, not as mindless workaholics, but with a sense of\ndirection.\n\n\nCompetition being fierce, they had to quickly adapt themselves to\nsudden changes in production, work schedules, technology and overseas market\ndemand.\n\n\nOn one occasion during a recession he had no compunction to lay off\ntwenty workers in one of his factories in order to introduce automation and\ncut cost.\n\n\nThere was a time when he spent his personal money with abandon, when\nlosing a cool million dollars in a gamble was just a minor irritation.\n\n\nBenny was not a gambler, but like all rich and successful\nbusinessmen, he allowed himself an occasional wager.\n\n\nHe never used the cash of his business concerns to play stakes - he\nwas too scrupulous for that.\n\n\nTo him, his money and that of his firms were distinctly separate.\n\n\nHe played the stock exchange more for fun than gain.\n\n\nAt first he was thrilled to make massive profits - it also gave him\nsatisfaction to recoup what he lost.\n\n\nBut after a year the routine of buying and selling became a bore.\n\n\nSo he tried his hand at commodities, followed by gold.\n\n\nHe didn\'t fare well in either, as it was impossible to know in\nadvance every facet of those distinctive types of business.\n\n\nBecause time was involved, he was not keen in playing futures.\n\n\nThere was one rule he strictly imposed upon himself: no hard-core\ngambling at the race track or in the gambling dens.\n\n\nHe scrupulously avoided card games because his father, an amateur\nmagician, had shown him as a boy how, by sleight of hand, he was able to fish\naces for himself from a pack.\n\n\nHe joined the exclusive clubs to play golf, to take executive meals\nor to wallow in the company of the hostesses during, but mostly after, the \'happy\nhour\'.\n\n\nHe drank moderately, was always in control of himself.\n\n\nAnd he travelled exclusively, mixing business with pleasure,\nconstantly conscious of taking all the precautions against AIDS.\n\n\nHe always went first class, was always generous with tips.\n\n\nHe had reached a stage where he had bought everything he personally\nrequired, having toyed with many models of limousines and continually\nupdating his home audio equipment.\n\n\nHe was no indiscriminate consumer, nor was he a compulsive one.\n\n\nLong business experience had taught him to buy the best actually\nneeded at the lowest price.\n\n\nIn this sense he couldn\'t see eye to eye with his wife, who seemed\nextravagant to no purpose.\n\n\nFor her, the need to maintain her social standing was paramount.\n\n\nWhat was money for but to be spent?\n\n\nShe considered her husband a miser in this respect.\n\n\n" What do you want from life, Ben?" a business friend asked him.\n\n\n" Well, I really don\'t know.\n\n\nI still have the ambition to be the richest man in Singapore.\n\n\nHaving achieved that, I don\'t know what more I want.\n\n\nHaving so much money, having no children, life is becoming sort of\nmeaningless.\n\n\nThe publicity I get is poor recompense."\n\n\nHe would be shocked if he were to know that the ordinary men in the\nstreet cared not two hoots who he was, how much he owned or the lifestyle he\nled.\n\n\nTo them he was only a name.\n\n\nThe people\'s concept of values had changed.\n\n\nThey were no longer entranced by stories of those who became\nfabulously rich, specially those who made it from rags to riches.\n\n\nThey couldn\'t care much for that - after all, it wasn\'t their wealth.\n\n\nOne evening in December he was sitting on the lambskin armchair\nstaring at the mirror he had purposely put up - it was obviously a habit he\nhad of late succumbed to.\n\n\nThere was no doubt he admired his designer shirt which came together\nwith a diamond fountain pen.\n\n\nHis hair was combed neatly in the style of the sleek Hollywood screen\nlover of the late Twenties.\n\n\nHis face was scarred, as if it was caused by the vicissitudes of his\nearly manhood.\n\n\nThere were stern lines etched around his eyes.\n\n\nWhen he pursed his thin lips, he gave away the stubborn determination\nin him.\n\n\nAfter some time he stood up, a man of average build who was\nsurprisingly slim considering that he ate well, in fact more than was good\nfor him.\n\n\nHe rose, then walked to the door.\n\n\nHe had to attend an important business gathering. \n\n\n\n\n Singaporama \n\n\n" Why, if it\'s not ..." The portly man in the white habit looked at\nBenny who had by then almost reached the peak of success in business.\n\n\n" Your face looks familiar.\n\n\nSorry, I can\'t exactly place you."\n\n\n" Patrick Choo.\n\n\nCan\'t you recognize your former schoolmate, Ben?\n\n\nCatholic High, 1960." He knew Benny as a scruffy, mischievous lad\nwhose parents always paid his school fees late.\n\n\n" Oh, yes.\n\n\nYou look so different now, Patrick." In school, Patrick was a\nhappy-go-lucky student with a pimply face.\n\n\n" You\'re married?"\n\n\n" Yes, several months ago to Grace.\n\n\nHer father\'s the famous tycoon Wee." This made Ben recall that\nPatrick used to go about with a girl.\n\n\nHowever, he thought it prudent not to ask the priest what happened to\nher.\n\n\n" You\'ve been featured quite often in some international business\nmagazines.\n\n\nI read that you\'ve done exceptionally well in life," Patrick Choo\nobserved with a very slight hint of cynicism.\n\n\nHe subtly implied that Benny could have done better in regard to his\nspiritual life but it seemed lost on the business magnate.\n\n\n" I\'m among the top ten richest men in Singapore.\n\n\nI\'m so loaded I can buy whatever I want.\n\n\nAnd you, Patrick, I see, have become a priest," Benny retorted.\n\n\nObviously the cynicism had not escaped him.\n\n\n" Yes, I was seven years in Eire, attached to a seminary in\nKilkenny.\n\n\nI returned to Singapore last year ..."\n\n\n" I should address you as Father Choo, then."\n\n\n" As you like, Ben."\n\n\n" You know, Father, I\'m a free-thinker."\n\n\n" To each man his own belief, though I find it hard to concede\nfree-thinking as a faith."\n\n\n" It\'s a modern trend ..."\n\n\n" My friend, it\'s neither the time nor place to discuss this.\n\n\nIf you can find time to come to my church in Katong, I\'d be glad to\ngive you my views."

{'text': 'The tropical thunderstorm had stopped as suddenly it had begun,\npetering out into a light grey drizzle that fell continuously all afternoon.\n\n\nThe dark trunk road, that ran from Taiping to Ipoh, cut through the\nplantations of straight rows of rubber trees, dripping with the wet.\n\n\nOn the right of the village lay the railway, and on the left, the\nrubber plantations stretched as far as the eye could see, stopping abruptly\nat the edge of the tin mines and the slopes of the secondary jungle.\n\n\nBeyond this rose the mountains of the Main Range, jutting thousands of\nfeet into the grey wet skies.\n\n\nThe farm lay at the edge of a plantation.\n\n\nEverything in the wooden farmhouse smelt damp because of the rain.\n\n\nSeventeen-year-old Pang Yoke-lin lay among the crumpled sheets of the\nfour-poster bed, moaning softly.\n\n\nA thin frail-looking girl, her face was bathed in sweat.\n\n\nThe child inside her was due, and yet it was reluctant to emerge.\n\n\nShe could feel it struggling and straining inside her, no longer a\npart of her, but something foreign with a will of its own.\n\n\nHer muscles were becoming tighter, and more and more taut with each\nnew cycle of pain.\n\n\nThe veins in her legs were swelling with the strain and she bit her\nlips as yet another wave of pain ripped through her pelvic region.\n\n\n" Stop crying and push.\n\n\nPush!" First Aunt hissed in her ear.\n\n\nYoke-lin was breathing hard.\n\n\nShe wanted to push the life out of her womb - get rid of it and hurl\nit into the laps of the Chows!\n\n\nShe pushed and pushed at the urging of First Aunt till all that was\nloving, tender and affectionate was forced out of her heart.\n\n\nNight came.\n\n\nFrom her bed in that tiny bedroom of the farmhouse, Yoke-lin saw the\nhard profile of her mother-in-law.\n\n\nThe coarse hands of thc farm woman were lighting a pair of red\ncandles on the altar of her Hakka ancestors.\n\n\nSoftly intoning their names, she called their spirits home to witness\nthe birth of the family\'s first grandchild.\n\n\nThe father-in-law, Old Chow, his weather-beaten face creased with\nworry, silently took down the kerosene lamp he reserved for festive\noccasions.\n\n\nHe was concerned over the unusually long labour.\n\n\nWhy was his grandson so reluctant to be born?\n\n\nUnconcerned about the mother, he feared that the long hours of strain\nmight harm the baby.\n\n\nHe lit the lamp and pumped it till the room was bright as daylight.\n\n\nIt was a good omen, and a good thing too that he had bought the lamp.\n\n\nThe village was newly established by the British forces, and it had\nno electricity yet.\n\n\n" Government people, phui!" he spat, dismissing the officials\'\npromise of a better life in these well-guarded New Villages established under\nthe Emergency.\n\n\nWhat had that got to do with him?\n\n\nHe was a farmer.\n\n\nAll he wanted was to be left in peace to grow his crops and rear his\nfowl.\n\n\nHe strode into his daughter-in-law\'s bedroom and hung the lamp from a\nbeam of the ceiling.\n\n\nThen he closed the room\'s only window, shutting out the black night.\n\n\nLike all peasants, he was superstitious - no one could tell what evil\nspirits might lurk out there, ready to harm the newborn.\n\n\nThe room was warm and bright.\n\n\nFirst Aunt bustled in, pushed Yoke-lin to one side of the bed and\nbegan lining it with cheap absorbent paper.\n\n\n" The baby is due.\n\n\nI\'ll fetch the hot water".\n\n\n\n\nUnable to bear her pain any longer, Yoke-lin let out a groan, then\nanother and another, louder and louder.\n\n\nThe pain in her loins was excruciating.\n\n\n" Open your legs.\n\n\nWider, ah!\n\n\nWider!" her mother-in-law leant over her.\n\n\n" Hold your breath.\n\n\nDon\'t scream"!\n\n\n" Remember, the medium said don\'t let out too much air!" First Aunt\ncautioned her.\n\n\nYoke-lin gritted her teeth and tried not to make a sound, grasping\nthe bed\'s headboard till her knuckles went white.\n\n\n" I can see his head!\n\n\nPush, push!" First Aunt cried.\n\n\n" Harder!\n\n\nHarder!" urged the mother-in-law.\n\n\n" He\'s coming!" Yoke-lin obeyed with anger, frustration and despair.\n\n\n" Aiya, where\'s Ah Chong?\n\n\nHas anyone looked for him?\n\n\nA father to be and he\'s not home yet!" the mother-in-law complained.\n\n\n" You go, sister-in-law, you go.\n\n\nI\'ll look after her,\' said First Aunt.\n\n\nYoke-lin shut her eyes.\n\n\nShe strained with all her strength like one pushing out her last\nbreath, her soul and all the sinews of her heart, pushing out that part of\nher body which had been defiled.\n\n\nSoiled and defiled!\n\n\nHer eyes choked with angry tears.\n\n\nCry after cry of rage escaped from her.\n\n\nShe pushed until she thought her bones would crack.\n\n\nWhat did that man care?\n\n\nNight after night, he had shoved her on to the bed, planted his seed\nand left.\n\n\nHe did what his father ordered him to do and that was that!\n\n\nIn their old age, fearing the end of their line, Old Chow and his\nwife had wanted a grandchild quickly.\n\n\nBut their only child, Ah Chong, was more interested in " playing\npolitics" than in marriage, the villagers said.\n\n\nOld Chow, a violent man, had had to box his ears on the wedding\nnight.\n\n\n" Go in and do it!" Old Chow had roared.\n\n\n" I paid two hundred for her, you know or not!\n\n\nI want a return.\n\n\nYou hear me"?\n\n\nThe whole village heard him.\n\n\nFor days afterwards, the villagers talked of nothing else but Ah\nChong and his bride.\n\n\n" Have you done it?" the farmers guffawed.\n\n\nThe baby was coming.\n\n\nYoke-lin could feel something tearing through her.\n\n\n" Push, push!" Her mother-in-law held her legs.\n\n\n" Push!\n\n\nWith all your strength!\n\n\nPush!" First Aunt held her thrashing arms.\n\n\nShe was being torn apart.\n\n\nA long animal howl escaped from her as she shut her eyes and let the\ndarkness slowly flood over her.\n\n\nWhen she opened her eyes again, the room was bright and warm, the air\ndamp with the smell of blood, and the papers under her were sodden wet.\n\n\nPale and worn out, she could feel the sweat of labour flowing\nunchecked, soaking her sarong and the sheets beneath her.\n\n\nShe lay back, exhausted.\n\n\n" Aiya, no good, no good, a girl!" First Aunt was bending over her,\nlooking distressed.\n\n\nThe two of them stared at the pink bundle in her arms.\n\n\nThe father-in-law strode into the room.\n\n\nWithout a word, he unhooked the kerosene lamp and extinguished it,\nplunging all of them into darkness.\n\n\nHours later, old Mrs Chow snuffed out the red candles, leaving only\nthe oil lamp burning.\n\n\nThe room was filled with shadows while outside, scattered dots of\nlight showed the houses of the villagers.\n\n\nA warm breeze brought the foul smell of pigs\' swill and manure.\n\n\nThe heavy peasant woman let out a sigh and sat down on the earthen\nstep of the doorway.\n\n\n" It\'s fate.\n\n\nWhat else but fate," she muttered, trying to explain the\nincomprehensible to herself.\n\n\n" I did everything; saved the money for the bride, took her to the\ntemple, made the son marry her and prayed to the ancestors, day and night".\n\n\n" The girl\'s young.\n\n\nMore grandchildren to come, maybe a son next year," First Aunt\nconsoled her.\n\n\n" Aiya, that\'s my prayer.\n\n\nMy old mother had sons.\n\n\nNo pain, no difficulty.\n\n\nThey dropped out of her like piglets, ah.\n\n\nSix boys, eight girls, one each year.\n\n\nAll lived.\n\n\nFifth Brother was born in the rice field.\n\n\nMa bit off his cord with her own teeth!\n\n\nBorn in the open, and yet he lived.\n\n\nBut mine, they die!\n\n\nWe Chows are cursed"!\n\n\n" Choy!\n\n\nChoy!" First Aunt exclaimed.\n\n\n" Ah Chong will give you many grandsons yet.\n\n\nWhere\'s Old Chow?" " Gone to look for Ah Chong"\n\n\n" The guards are so strict, they won\'t open the gates so late".\n\n\n" I could see from his face," Mrs Chow continued, " Ah Chong\'s\nfather was bitter.\n\n\nI thought he was going to slap Yoke-lin"!\n\n\n" A girl!\n\n\nIn my village in China they threw girls into the river," said First\nAunt.\n\n\n" In our village, Ma said that the fathers pressed their girl babies\ninto the mud"!\n\n\nAnd in her bedroom, Yoke-lin was sobbing quietly.\n\n\nShe was a failure.\n\n\nDuring her twelve months in this Hakka household, the man who gave\nher this child had come and gone without a word.\n\n\nSometimes, he was gone for days, and his mother would scold and\nblame her, saying she was a useless piece of wood, unable to hold on to the\nman she had married.\n\n\nWhat could she do?\n\n\nThey never spoke.\n\n\nHe came to her only when he was drunk.\n\n\nThe few times that he had shown any interest in her, she was already\nbig and clumsy with child, and he merely gave her some extra food to eat.\n\n\nMost of the time, they were strangers, doing what they had to.\n\n\nBut their child now lay sleeping by her side, the pink little face\npuckering up in tiny wrinkles.\n\n\nShe had thought that this marriage would free her from being trapped\nin a fate like her mother\'s.\n\n\nHer mother - poor, illiterate, ignorant and stupid had lived with\none man after another, dragging her brood of girls from small town to small\ntown: Kulim, Bukit Mertajam, Batu Gajah, Telok Anson, an endless drabness in\ndim wooden huts upon which the rains pelted mercilessly and water dripped\ninto rusty tins.\n\n\nAlways on the move, always poor and in debt, never knowing when\nsomeone would buy them a meal, she grew up believing that a proper marriage\nwas security.\n\n\nOutside her bedroom the two older women were sill whispering, their\nvoices low and anxious as they waited for their men folk to return.\n\n\nWith the Emergency curfew it was not safe to walk about at night.\n\n\nFirst Aunt came into the room.\n\n\n" Sleep," she ordered Yoke-lin.\n\n\n" After labour must rest.\n\n\nBoy or girl, you rest".\n\n\nYoke-lin\'s eyes filled with tears at this bit of kindness.\n\n\nHer own mother had not been so lucky.\n\n\nThe trishaw rider with whom she had lived for many years had killed\nher when she gave birth to her sixth daughter.\n\n\nHis face red with drink, he had raged like a mad bull because the\nbaby was not the son he expected.\n\n\nHe pulled her mother by the hair and dragged the still bleeding\nwoman from her bed, slapping and punching her.\n\n\nSomething was wrong with her body that could not produce a son.\n\n\nAgain and again, he banged her head against the wall.\n\n\nHis ancestors\' graves were cold and it was her fault.\n\n\nFinally, her mother had collapsed.\n\n\nThe children huddled under the table, wailing.\n\n\nThat night, the sounds of pain from that tormented, writhing body on\nthe floor had bewildered them.\n\n\nBy morning their mother had bled to death.\n\n\nYoke-lin, at the age of eight, became an orphan.\n\n\nThe baby on the bed let out a lusty wail.\n\n\nYoke-lin awoke with a start and gathered her baby daughter into her\narms.\n\n\nThe farmhouse seemed full of angry people speaking in loud staccato\nHakka.\n\n\n" The fool!\n\n\nHe\'s already dead!"\n\n\nOld Chow\'s voice rose above the din.\n\n\n" Let the horse-face guards shoot him!\n\n\nI have no son"!\n\n\n\n\n" Choy!\n\n\nChoy!\n\n\nHow can?\n\n\nYour one and only son!" the women gasped.\n\n\n" What d\'you want me do, ha?\n\n\nIf not the soldiers now, it\'ll be the communists later!\n\n\nYou think once inside, they\'ll let him come back to us?" Old Chow\nasked, exasperated by the events.\n\n\n" Heaven, hear me, a poor mother!\n\n\nWhat wrong did I do that you punish me like this?\n\n\nI kowtow from temple to temple, and still I suffer like this"?\n\n\n\n\nOld Mrs Chow knocked her head on the altar so violently that the\nancestral tablets rattled.\n\n\n" Sister-in-law, Ah Chong\'s mother, don\'t cry so.\n\n\nNot your fault.\n\n\nNo one said you did wrong".\n\n\nFirst Aunt\'s voice rose and fell as more and more relations crowded\ninto the farmhouse to have their say.\n\n\nBecause all were from the same clan, the same village, or related by\nmarriage, each felt he had a right to comment and advise the Chows on what to\ndo. \n\n\nThis was a family matter.\n\n\nA crisis had occurred, and the family must come together, to talk\nthings over, to confer and decide on the best course of action to take.\n\n\nSuch things, however, often lead to the teeth biting the tongue,\nthe old Chinese used to say, for no matter how close the family, members are\nbound to argue and quarrel at such times.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '857f6501-95e7-43f4-b6c5-e3745cc2dcf1', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.873658+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9901490211486816, 'non_english_score': 0.00985097885131836}

that he\nis watching me with his old brown eyes.\n\n\nHe watches over me, the Padre, because he knows what I come here for.\n\n\nI come to his altar rail seeking the solace of his pasta and wine, and\nfor communion with another human being, the listening ear of my friend.\n\n\nForgive me Father, for I have sinned.\n\n\nI have loved a woman.\n\n\nThat was Father Luigi\'s sin too, and that is why I come to him to make\nmy confessions.\n\n\nHe understands.\n\n\nHe threw in the cloth for a soprano in his parish choir.\n\n\nLike a siren song, her voice led him to run his soul aground.\n\n\nAnd she never married him.\n\n\nShe finally sold herself to an MBA with the scion of a wealthy\ntowkay.\n\n\n" A hard habit to break," the Padre always says of communions and\nconfessions at his bar-counter.\n\n\nBut there is comfort in that, of course.\n\n\nYour confessions are safe with the Padre.\n\n\nHe will bear your burden of secrecy.\n\n\nAnd so, when the half-light falls, I mount my Lady of the Knight and\nride from the Ridge to the Ville and the Last Chance Cafe.\n\n\nFather Luigi\'s prices are alright.\n\n\nFour dollars for a sinner\'s dinner of spaghetti or lasagna and an\nextra dollar for the wine; and if you plan on staying after dinner, bring a\npocketful of change for the jukebox.\n\n\nI always stay for supper, so after dinner, I bring the wine over to\nthe bar-counter to chat a bit with the Padre.\n\n\nThen I move off to make space for the new repentants and repeat\noffenders.\n\n\nThe Padre has already heard my confession.\n\n\nThere is a dark little corner near the jukebox and it is there that I\noften sit with my head against the wall, with the grinning skull that is my\nbike helmet, feeding the polished chrome and glaring neon of the jukebox,\nfinding my psalms in the rock and roll.\n\n\nI can quote those songs chapter and verse for you.\n\n\nAnd lately, that is what I have been doing here most nights.\n\n\nBy the dim glow of an old-fashioned brass oil lamp, I try to put my\nheart on paper, like the psalmists of the Good Book and the psalmists running\naround at 45 rpm in the jukebox, as if doing so might purge me of my sin and\nguilt.\n\n\nTwo other things rest on the checkered table-cloth, beside a shabby\nnotebook and my battered old Parker.\n\n\nOne is a slim stack of letters.\n\n\nThe other is my wallet, opened like a Pandora\'s box with a haunting\nblack and white photo of a girl with a hesitant smile, like a virgin bride on\nher wedding night.\n\n\nIt is not easy, trying to make a reality from words, from a memory I\noften wish had only stayed a dream.\n\n\nBut I have never heard a song that could say everything I felt about\nAriel.\n\n\nThis is Ariel\'s song then, and I hope you will forgive me this\nindulgence which the good Padre has not been guilty of selling me.\n\n\nAnd is not forgiveness all that matters in the end?\n\n\nFather, please hear my

known and go some place you\'ve never been?\n\n\nBut if you say it\'s best, I suppose it will be okay.\n\n\nI still don\'t want to go, but I know that if I don\'t, you won\'t be\nmine for long anyway.\n\n\nYou don\'t have to explain.\n\n\nI understand.\n\n\nAnd I forgive you.\n\n\nWell, at least there is still a chance things will work out for us.\n\n\nI shall write again, once I\'ve seen my first New Zealand sunrise ..."\n\n\nCorridors are lit by the cold grey-green of fluorescent tubes.\n\n\nBut the light in the darkened room seems blue, blue-dark like the\nmidnight sky.\n\n\nThere are a few stars, a sickle-moon, trails of night-grey clouds\ncaught on its points.\n\n\nBeyond the blinds of the room, the lights that line the footpath burn\nyellow-orange.\n\n\nMy father had held up his hand once in that yellow-orange light and\nsaid, son, this is the colour of a dead man\'s hand.\n\n\nI had never seen a dead man, so I agreed.\n\n\nBut I know better now.\n\n\nDead men are grey-green.\n\n\nI had held my father\'s hand in the grey-green flourescence of a\nmortuary.\n\n\nA soft hand is slipped into mine, fingers long and smooth, curling\naround my own, roughened by the knurled grips of tools and motorcycle oil.\n\n\nHer hair is soft against my arm, long and black in the night, as she\nleans on me.\n\n\n" Don\'t look out the window.\n\n\nLook at me," she says.\n\n\nI turn to face her.\n\n\nShe has a beautiful face, ghostly blue-white in the night, but to\nkiss her is to know that this is no porcelain-face of a harlequin.\n\n\nHer lips are warm, cheeks soft and getting warmer as the blood rushes\nto her face.\n\n\nShe is wearing no make-up and my tongue tip finds her lips only\nfaintly sweet.\n\n\nHer hands are on my neck, stroking and then running into my hair,\npulling back and I feel the electric tug against the roots.\n\n\nShe pulls away, head bent down.\n\n\nPulling her to me, her breasts are soft against my chest.\n\n\nI can feel her heart beating.\n\n\nHer arms grow tight around me and she is crying.\n\n\n" I don\'t want to go"\n\n\n" But you must"\n\n\n" Must I?"\n\n\n" We\'ve been through this before, Ariel," I remind her gently.\n\n\nFor your own good, darling.\n\n\nOr for mine.\n\n\nSomewhere at the back of my mind are the beginnings of guilt.\n\n\nI can\'t fit you into my life.\n\n\nIt sounds so brutal, but even then, the words are not mine.\n\n\nSomeone said them to me once, when I was a boy of seventeen.\n\n\nI never thought I\'d hear those words from me.\n\n\nShe must never hear them.\n\n\nThey would hurt too much.\n\n\nYet, perhaps she already knows.\n\n\n" But I love you," she whispers, her voice almost inaudible.\n\n\nShe does not want me to hear the breaking in her voice.\n\n\nShe is a proud girl.\n\n\n" And I love you too."\n\n\n" Then why?"\n\n\n" Ariel"\n\n\n" I\'m sorry"\n\n\n" Remember your promise?"\n\n\n" Yes.\n\n\nI will remember.\n\n\nI promise to try to be happy and give myself a chance to live all\nover again"\n\n\n" Good girl"\n\n\nShe fits so well in my arms, it is almost like she was made to be\nthere.\n\n\nThere is a sense of wholeness, of completeness for me that I have\nnever felt in my life.\n\n\nWhy am I sending you away, Ariel?\n\n\nBut no, my reason tells me we could be happy now, but not for\nalways.\n\n\nWhat was the reason I had been given as a seventeen year old boy?\n\n\nWe come from different worlds, Puck.\n\n\nWe come from different worlds, Ariel.\n\n\nI went into yours for a while and found you and could not bear to\nleave you behind.\n\n\nSo I took you back to mine.\n\n\nAnd found I could not fit you into my life.\n\n\nAm I a bastard for doing that?\n\n\n" Will we ever see each other again?"\n\n\n" Yes, Ariel.\n\n\nBut you mustn\'t come back here for quite a while.\n\n\nI shall go to you"\n\n\n" Then this is the last time we have together?"\n\n\n" For the time being"\n\n\nShe looks at me with those eyes that say so much, everything I want\nto hear, everything I don\'t.\n\n\n" Will you?"\n\n\n" Will I what, girl?"\n\n\n" Will you make love to me then?"\n\n\nShe has been in this room for a fortnight with me, but I have never\ntouched her, not that way.\n\n\nAgain, I do not really know why.\n\n\nShe has a sleek, tight, Reebok-trim body and we have shared this\nbed, she, sleeping like a baby, head beneath my chin.\n\n\nShe has a hurt look of rejection now and I can guess what is going\nthrough her mind.\n\n\nYou do not want to make love to me because of what I\'ve been.\n\n\nShe edges away but I bring her back.\n\n\n" I do"\n\n\n" You\'re not afraid of catching something from me?"\n\n\nThere is a touch of bitterness in her voice, but it is sad, resigned\nto whatever answer I may give.\n\n\n" I never was".\n\n\nShe pushes me away to arm\'s length and looks at me for a moment.\n\n\nThen without another word, she pulls her tee-shirt over her head.\n\n\nIt is mine really and I watch the words, National University of\nSingapore, disappear as the shirt is turned inside out.\n\n\nShe shakes her hair loose and they fall in front of her breasts,\ncovering the mounds reflecting the blue-white light of the night.\n\n\nGently, I push her down and her hair falls like a black shower,\nspread out on the pillow.\n\n\nShe tilts her chin up, offering her lips to me.\n\n\nI feel their warmth and sweetness again as we press hard against\neach other, as if it were possible to get any closer, and I understand at\nlast, the meaning of the words, \'and they were made one flesh\'.\n\n\n0100 hours\n\n\n" ...I\'ve seen it!\n\n\nThe sunrise here is so lovely and I\'m going to make it a point to\nwake up every morning to see it.\n\n\nAunt Emma and Uncle Bob were at the airport to pick me up.\n\n\nYou\'re right, they are very nice people.\n\n\nThey\'ve given me a room of my own and the windows face the east,\nthat\'s how I get to watch the sun.\n\n\nRemember how we used to ride down to the sea in the mornings just to\nwatch the sun together?\n\n\nI think of you now whenever I see the sunrise.\n\n\nIt\'s a nice feeling I get, but after that, it\'s always a bit sad\nbecause I do miss you.\n\n\nWhen will you come to watch a sunrise with me?\n\n\n..."\n\n\nShe is asleep with the night, but I am awake to look at her, to fix\nher in my mind and memory.\n\n\nShe seemed older when I first met her in person, but in the past few\nweeks, the freshness I remember from long ago has been returning to her\ncheeks.\n\n\nBut her eyes, and the way she looks at me, they have always been\nthat way.\n\n\nThey have never changed, haunting me once, haunting me still,\ncomforting, yet bringing back guilt...\n\n\nWe met in a rusty metal cupboard, oxidation painted over with olive\ndrab.\n\n\nI was nineteen and on a level of hell called Tekong.\n\n\nShe was a pin-up girl, blutacked to the cupboard door below the\nmirror, left there by the guy before me.\n\n\nI had been about to take her black and white picture down and\nreplace her with a dolly of my own, in colour so real I could see breasts\nheaving.\n\n\nThen her eyes had caught mine; her face, her neck, the bit of chest\nthat showed through black lace, the shoulders brought up and front, the\nfragile hands, lit luminous white against the folds of her dress, light\ncatching in her back-blown hair like a halo against the darkness behind her.\n\n\nBut her eyes, and the uncertain smile, made her look more virginal\nthan sensual and it made me want to protect her, not rape her.\n\n\nLooking at her again in the shuttered dimness of the room, I find\nthat the feeling has not changed.\n\n\nShe stayed and I grew to love her.\n\n\nIt was not hard.\n\n\nThere had been a previous love in college, but that living,\nbreathing girl had wanted something more than a living, breathing man. \n\n\nSo I had stuck belukar ferns into my heart and sold my soul to the\narmy, wet dream theme of idealistic little boys.\n\n\nMisdirected affection?\n\n\nPerhaps, but at the time it seemed like a good idea.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'cba8ca85-0496-4344-9937-120083e24364',

{'text': 'WHEN THE TABEBUIA BLOOMED AT SOO CHOW GARDENS \n\n\nHO POH FUN\n\n\nA sixty-four year old man paused momentarily at the entrance of a\nmodestly furnished two-storey corner terrace house at Soo Chow Gardens.\n\n\nHe lifted the latch, pushed through the gate, and was soon on the\nroad.\n\n\nAt once a shrill cry hit the air.\n\n\nIt came from a three-year-old child from the room in the house where\nshe was being coaxed to finish her cereal.\n\n\nBy mutual agreement, the child was deposited at the house early each\nmorning so that she could be looked after while both her parents were away at\nwork.\n\n\nHer parents had already left.\n\n\nThat morning her paternal grandfather had spoken of taking her out\nwith him on a stroll around the neighbourhood and she wondered whether he had\nforgotten.\n\n\n" Yeh Yeh is just going out to look at the trees," said old Mr Lee in\nan effort to reassure his grandchild.\n\n\nThis was after he had retraced his steps back to the house and poked\nhis head in at the door.\n\n\n" Yeh Yeh will wait outside for Cai Yen.\n\n\nCai Yen is a good girl.\n\n\nGood girls always finish their cereal.\n\n\nYou have finished?\n\n\nGood girl!\n\n\nNow you can go wash up, get dressed and put on your shoes".\n\n\n" Don\'t forget your hat".\n\n\nTo his wife, seated watchful at the table, he asked, " Did you notice\nthat the trees are in bloom?"\n\n\nMr Lee could not remember when the trees were first planted at Soo\nChow Gardens.\n\n\nIn fact he only came to know their name when some men from the Parks\nand Recreation Department came to lop off some branches that hindered the\ngrowth of the prized Christmas trees planted at the corner of his garden.\n\n\nHe had sent a letter complaining about the branches of the " said\ntree" obstructing his Christmas tree.\n\n\nHe was referring specifically to the tree planted on the sidewalk\njust in front of his house.\n\n\nHe was still referring to the " said tree" when the men arrived with\ntheir ladder and saws.\n\n\nThe supervisor of the team said to him very politely, " Excuse me,\nSir.\n\n\nThe name of the \'said tree\' is \'Tabebuia\'".\n\n\nFor a long while, the trees had merely existed as just the right kind\nto cultivate to provide shade for pedestrian and parked car.\n\n\nSo Mr Lee thought.\n\n\nEach tree provided strong horizontal branching, with large\ntongue-like leaflets spread out in clusters of five - like the outspread\npalms of men\'s hands, nature-fashioned.\n\n\nThey were fast-growing and never needed individual tending.\n\n\nA few days ago, while inspecting the vandas in his garden, he had\npaused to look down the road.\n\n\nA few trees were beginning to flower.\n\n\nHe thought the mauve pink flowers very pretty amidst the green\nfoliage.\n\n\nThis morning every tree along the road appeared to be flowering.\n\n\nMost of the houses in the neighbourhood remained shut during the day.\n\n\nMr Lee thought that the sight of the Tabebuia flowering in such rich\nprofusion would inevitably change the mood of the entire place.\n\n\nThe Tabebuia had its essence planted everywhere in the estate - Soo\nChow View down Soo Chow Garden Road to Soo Chow Rise, Soo Chow Drive and Soo\nChow Walk.\n\n\nEven the most unsociable of inhabitants would be drawn out to admire\nthe scenery.\n\n\nMost of the trees measured at least ten metres if not more in height.\n\n\nOne subspecies featured trees spangled with crisp pink wing-like\nblooms.\n\n\nAnother featured trees so heavily mounted by pink petals that the\ngreenery on each branch looked almost totally obliterated.\n\n\nThe Tabebuia was in bloom at Soo Chow Gardens.\n\n\nThe atmosphere was certainly very festive.\n\n\nThe vibrant pink set against the vibrant green of most of the trees\nthreatened to engulf every inhabitant\'s general notion of the sky.\n\n\nYet there was something rather disturbing about the thought.\n\n\nThe estate was probably named after Suchou - one of the better scenic\nspots of China - a place of high culture, the confluence of China\'s best\npoets and scholars, a place where emperors reputedly got intoxicated, if not\ndrunk, by the empire\'s most beautiful women.\n\n\nThe Tabebuia?\n\n\nHe had heard that it originated in South America.\n\n\nHe could well understand the aspiration to link even one staid spot\nin Singapore with the beauties and the sublimities of Suchou.\n\n\nBut the Tabebuia?\n\n\nWhat had a native from South America to do with the Suchou of China -\ngranted that the Suchou of China had something to do with Singapore?\n\n\nHis eyes pierced the trees as he pondered hard and long to arrive at\na satisfactory answer.\n\n\nA strong wind had blown through the estate the night before, and the\nmorning after, several of the fragile flowers were found severed from their\nstalks.\n\n\nThen came a heavy drizzle, separating flowers from their stalks more\ncleanly.\n\n\nAnd now - after the mist had lifted the mauve pink flowers lay\nscattered in drains, spilled over hedges into private gardens, and spread\nlike loosely-crafted carpets on sidewalk and road.\n\n\nMr Lee observed the floral waste and wondered whether there was any\nreason to feel sorry for the flowers that lay crushed - having been trodden\non unintentionally by feet - or flattened - having been rolled over\nunintentionally by tyres.\n\n\nThe translucence of the petals might have attracted the eye about an\nhour ago.\n\n\nNow they looked horribly pasty and twisted.\n\n\nHe could imagine more of the petals slowly changing colour as the\ntemperature rose further in the day.\n\n\nHe took time to stoop down and pick up a flower that had probably\njust fallen from a tree.\n\n\nThe bloom in his hand had not yet turned a dark amethyst.\n\n\nThere it lay - still and naked without its stalk.\n\n\nHe could not refrain from lifting the dank folds of the soft-hued\npetals.\n\n\nThey exposed a pale tender sheath-like interior that glistened with\nthe quality of some undefinable warmth.\n\n\n" Yeh Yeh, I\'m ready!" sang the very precocious Cai Yen as she\nskipped down the garden towards him, her voice electrifying the air.\n\n\nThe child certainly looked very smart, thought Mr Lee.\n\n\nShe seemed capable of overthrowing the old world cliche of the "\nsweet young thing".\n\n\nShe had on that morning a navy blue and red T-shirt the kind that\nalways looked right on a bright and well-fed exuberant child - and matching\nnavy blue shorts.\n\n\nShe waved a nifty little sun hat as she skipped.\n\n\nEach time her soles hit the ground her sneakers squeaked.\n\n\nMr Lee looked at his wife and saw how relieved she was as she\ndischarged her care.\n\n\nShe cut a matronly figure and wasn\'t exactly shapeless.\n\n\nBut years of doing the same chores in front of the kitchen sink and\ntrundling around with heavy marketing baskets had turned her arms stocky and\nher fingers swollen and stodgy.\n\n\nWhen he first courted her, she had been the slenderest of seven\nsisters.\n\n\nHe looked at his wife again and sighed.\n\n\n" Remember not to dash across the road, and make sure that you keep\nvery close to Yeh Yeh," said the woman.\n\n\nThen she turned back into the house with a certain grace - as if\nafter so many years she still found in it an intrinsic fascination.\n\n\nThe child chattered all the way along So Chow View and down the\nsidewalk as it dipped rather sharply into Soo Chow Garden Road.\n\n\nAt intervals she sang snatches of songs she had learnt at Sunday\nSchool.\n\n\nSometimes she grew restless and ran ahead, quite oblivious of the\nother\'s presence.\n\n\nThen she stopped, thinking that she had run too far ahead.\n\n\nShe leaned against a railing mounted along the edge of the terraced\ndrain and gazed up at the way she had come, her ears filled with the sound of\ngushing water flowing from some unknown source after the rain.\n\n\nShe watched her grandfather approaching the level of the ground on\nwhich she stood and took stock of his thinning hair and unshaven chin.\n\n\n" Yeh Yeh needs a shave," she said and looked grave.\n\n\nUnconsciously she had reproduced the very look her mother gave her\nfather each time she remarked that he needed a shave.\n\n\nHer grandfather looked at her and wondered what business a girl like\nher had to look so grave on a morning when every tree that they passed was\nheavy with bloom.\n\n\nWhat business furthermore had she to tell an old man that he needed\nto get rid of the stubble around his chin?\n\n\n" See those insects buzzing around the clump of pink flowers over\nthere?" he said, seeking to divert her attention away from himself.\n\n\n" Insects," said the girl.\n\n\n" Well, we call them bees," said the old man.\n\n\n" Bees," said the girl.\n\n\n" And do you know what bees do?"\n\n\n" Bees do?" echoed the girl.\n\n\n" Well ...er...they buzz," said the old man, desperately trying to\nrecollect what he had learnt about bees decades ago.\n\n\n" Well they buzz," said the girl.\n\n\n" And they make honey," said the old man, suddenly remembering more.\n\n\n" They visit the flowers and they collect the nectar, and they bring\nit to some hidden place - probably in the MacRitchie Forest - where the Queen\nBee lives, and ..."\n\n\nHe stopped and couldn\'t remember any more.\n\n\nOr he was tired and didn\'t feel like probing deeper into the further\nrecesses of his memory.\n\n\nHe solved the problem by saying, " Yeh Yeh will buy Cai Yen a\npicture book on bees."\n\n\nNow the child wanted her grandfather to stop by at the piece of\nparkland located between Soo Chow Drive and Soo Chow Walk.\n\n\nReluctantly Mr Lee agreed.\n\n\nThe child led the way, evidently having frequented the spot before.\n\n\nShe sat on a swing and had her grandfather give it a push.\n\n\nThe swing creaked forward and backward in synchrony to her giggles\nand shrieks.\n\n\nMr Lee sat on a nearby swing not moving while observing his\ngrandchild\'s childish glee, his mind full of the spatterings of mauve petals\nposed atop spreading boughs of vibrant green foliage, and of the petalled\nsoftness disintegrating within the shaded circumference of every tree.\n\n\nHe had walked down Soo Chow Garden Road and had become suddenly\naware of another species of the Tabebuia which featured flowers of a very\npale shade - so pale that they looked almost white.\n\n\nIt had been a shock to learn of the existence of these taller trees\nwith flowers distilled to such paleness.\n\n\nThe white profuseness cast an air of dissonance to the scene.\n\n\nDespite the pose of starry brilliance, the petals which showed not a\ntaint of colour seemed to him eerily sterile.\n\n\nCai Yen had got down from the swing and she now broke into his\nthoughts by saying that she was hot.\n\n\nWould her Yeh Yeh treat her to ice-cream at the ice-cream palace at\nThomson Plaza?\n\n\nMr Lee looked at her flushed chubby face, plump arms and legs, and\nwondered whether the girl would grow to be ethereal.\n\n\nWith the young this was possible as a subject for contemplation ...\n\n\nbut with the old...?\n\n\nMr Lee wished that he could banish all thought of the spectre-like\nwhiteness that was causing so much unease.\n\n\nIt would be good to drown it all in a few scoops of ice cream.\n\n\nThey went to Swensen\'s and ordered strawberry ice cream for Cai Yen\nand vanilla for himself.\n\n\nWhen they reached home, his wife found out and was angry because the\nice cream would cause Cai Yen to lose appetite for the food she had prepared.\n\n\nHe sat through this bout of his wife\'s rantings during lunch.\n\n\nIt spoilt his appetite - he wondered whether she was aware.\n\n\nBut he kept quiet throughout in his usual disarming way and tried\ncounting his blessings.\n\n\nThat always helped when one had reason to be angry and didn\'t want\nto lose one\'s temper.\n\n\nHe thought how fortunate he was to have such a wife who ran his\nhousehold and helped raise his children.\n\n\nThere were other outlets in life but she had resigned from her job\nto attend to his needs even before the children came. \n\n\nShe was angry now, but her anger would soon cool and she would\nprobably feel guilty and treat him with extra tenderness.\n\n\nShe would become more responsive to his needs and might even stay\nup to watch the late night movie.\n\n\nOr he might persuade her to put on the cheongsam he had always\nloved to see her wear.\n\n\nShe might even let him help her put on the thick diamond ear studs -\nhe would be so gentle, she wouldn\'t even cry.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '01208e9a-3639-4e48-b6b5-a8d56158f61d', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.876293+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9901679158210754, 'non_english_score': 0.00983208417892456}

{'text': 'Bangsawan\n\n\n A Social and Stylisitic History of Popular Malay Opera \n\n\nby Tan Sooi Beng\n\n\n Chapter 4 \n\n\n The Promotion of Stars, c1880 - c1930 \n\n\n Stars \n\n\nBEING commercial theatre, bangsawan depicted its performers not just\nas actors and actresses but as stars ( bintang), that is, they were\nprofessionals who worked as entertainers.\n\n\nUnlike performers of the traditional wayang kulit or makyong who\nusually had other sources of income such as farming, for the bangsawan\nperformer, particularly the stars viewed, acting was a full-time occupation.\n\n\nThe sri panggung ( heroine) and orang muda ( hero) were the key\nmembers of the troupe; they were its stars.\n\n\nAs the Malacca Guardian ( 9 May 1932) reported, \'the whole company\ngives way to the star, who gets a liberal sum of about forty pounds per\nweek\'.\n\n\nIt was the stars which established a company\'s reputation.\n\n\nThe following announcements that \'the most famous actors, actresses\nand clowns from Medan, Batavia and Singapore\' had arrived to tour Malaya (\n7imes of Malaya, 22 January 1926) were typical: The Starlight Opera Co.\n\n\nbeg to announce the appearance of their young, beautiful, charming,\nattractive and famous new actress Miss Fatimah of Singapore who has never\nplayed in the FMS and is specialized in Extra Turns.\n\n\nHer songs in different languages are so numerous that they will not\nbe repeated until she has sung the whole series.\n\n\nIt will be delightful to see how pretty she looks, how clever she\ndances, how sweet she sings ( Times of Malaya, 29 December 1925).\n\n\nSeveral new artistes have arrived by the SS Denver Van Tuves\nyesterday to augment the troupe of the Rose Opera.\n\n\nMisses Paulino and Gina with Bob and Kasban, the well-known and\npopular Kronchong singers of Medan, and Haji Hassan, the famous Gambus Player\nand singer are amongst the arrivals to join force with the Sri Rose Opera (\nStraits Echo, 10 December 1932).\n\n\nPerformers of varied ethnic backgrounds were recruited and promoted\nas stars.\n\n\nMiss Van Cantarfischer and Miss Dora van Smith were important\nEuropean prima donnas of the Indra Permata Theatrical Co.\n\n\nTheir \'acting and singing\' were reportedly so fine that they \'elicited\nloud applause from the audience\' ( Straits Echo, 19 May 1904).\n\n\nMr Tan Tjeng Bok was a well-known Chinese actor.\n\n\nBorn in Java, he was also known as the \'Douglas Fairbanks of Java\'\nand he acted in the famous Dardanella and Miss Riboet\'s Orion.\n\n\nIn 1933, Tan Tjeng Bok joined the Moonlight Opera Co.\n\n\nof Penang and captivated the audience with his \'singing of the\nkroncong\' ( Straits F cho, 1 May 1933).\n\n\nIn yet another performance by the same company, an Arab performer, \'Sheik\nOmar was applauded for his excellent singing\' ( Straits Echo, 22 May 1933).\n\n\nChild stars were promoted as novelties.\n\n\nThe audience at a Wayang Kassim performance was invited to see \'the\nyoungest clown in the world\' who was \'only five years old\' ( Straits Echo, 8\nAugust 1908).\n\n\nThe Kinta Opera Co had its Miss Echon, a \'nine-year-old actress\' who\nsang English songs ( Straits Echo, 3 January 1925), while Genani Star Opera\nboasted of \'Baby Star Miss Nani\' ( Straits Echo, 7 November 1925).\n\n\n Recruits of Various Ethnic Backgrounds \n\n\nWhat attracted young people of various ethnic origins to join the\nbangsawan troupes?\n\n\nThe stories related to me told of motives which were not very\ndifferent from those of young men and women aspiring to be actors and\nactresses in the film world of today.\n\n\nYoung boys from the kampong were lured to thc town to earn a living,\nmany no longer contented with a life of farming.\n\n\nOthers came from poor or broken homes; they saw the bangsawan as a\nway to earn a living ( cari makan) or to see the world ( merantau tempat).\n\n\nAll who joined bangsawan were tempted by the glamour of stardom and\nfame which the touring companies - and the urban areas, seen as places of\nadventure, excitement, and drama offered.\n\n\nIn his late eighties when I met him, Wan ( Plate 30), a former orang\nmuda, manager of Starlight Opera, and proprietor of Wan Man Sri Bangsawan,\nremembered that as a young boy he had always wanted to see the world.\n\n\nAfter completing four years of schooling in Penang, Wan decided to\nbecome independent of his parents and to earn money so that he could travel.\n\n\nHis father, a schoolteacher, could not do anything to change his\nmind.\n\n\nWan left school and found himself a job as a delivery boy for the\nFraser and Neave Aerated Water Company, delivering bottles of aerated water\nto shops on his three-wheel bicycle for\n&dollar;12 a month.\n\n\nHowever, he still could not afford to travel to the places he had\nheard of.\n\n\nDisheartened, he looked up a Bengali friend, a bangsawan performer by\nthe name of Babjan.\n\n\nWan recalled the advice of Babjan: \'Wan, Wan, if you want to travel\nbut do not have money, join the bangsawan.\n\n\nFood and shelter will be provided, and you will get to go places\'.\n\n\nHe was about fourteen or fifteen years old then.\n\n\nMany recruits came from impoverished or broken homes.\n\n\nThe 70 year-old veteran orang muda, Mahmud Jun, was born the son of a\npoor farmer.\n\n\nLeaving his family and village at the age of fourteen with\n&dollar;3 in his pocket, he took the train from Alor Star to Ipoh.\n\n\nThere, he helped a porter to carry baggage at the railway station in\nreturn for some pocket money.\n\n\nThen he set up a stall selling noodles in a park.\n\n\nIt was there, two or three months later, that a bangsawan troupe, the\nGrand Jubilee Opera owned by Shaw Brothers, happened to pitch its tent.\n\n\nThe general manager was a Kedah man who used to live in Mahmud Jun\'s\nvillage.\n\n\n\'He knew my father and my uncle but he was richer than we were,\'\nMahmud Jun said.\n\n\nThe manager told Mahmud, \'Follow me and work in the bangsawan.\n\n\nIf I see your father, he would be angry with me if I did not take\ncare of you\'.\n\n\n\'That was how I joined the bangsawan and became like his son,\'\naccording to Mahmud Jun.\n\n\nIn his late eighties, Suki, a former orang Jnuda, film star and owner\nof Dian Sandiwara, gave me the following account of why he went into\nbangsawan acting.\n\n\nBorn in Padang, Sumatra, Suki joined the bangsawan because he wanted\nto look for his father who had left home to manage the estate of the Sultan\nof Negeri Sembilan.\n\n\nSuki\'s father was the chief police ranger of Padang but had quit the\npolice force because he disliked the Dutch colonialists.\n\n\nBy then, he had already divorced Suki\'s mother.\n\n\nAfter his mother died, Suki stayed with his grandmother for a while.\n\n\nBut he wanted to meet his father again.\n\n\n\'I thought that if I joined the opera, I would have the opportunity\nto go to Singapore and then to the mainland to look for my father,\' he said.\n\n\nSo when the Royal Opera came to Padang, Suki offered his services.\n\n\n\'The manager took me in as I had the looks and could sing and act\'.\n\n\nAinon Chik ( Plate 31), a 70-year-old veteran sri panggung, recalled\nthat she followed her sister and brother-in-law who joined Genani Star Opera\nafter the death of both her parents in Singapore.\n\n\nThe sisters had no relatives to turn to.\n\n\nAinon\'s mother was a Sarawakian Chinese while her father was a Bugis\nwho had migrated to Sarawak.\n\n\nAinon\'s parents eloped to Singapore because her grandparents did not\napprove of the mixed marriage.\n\n\nAinon was eight years old then.\n\n\n\'My brother-in-law could earn twice as much as an electrician and\nstage hand in the bangsawan than as an electrician in a private firm,\' she\nsaid.\n\n\nMenah Yem ( Plate 32), a well known dancer and sri panggung of her\ntime, started performing in the bangsawan at the age of nine.\n\n\nThat was almost eighty years ago.\n\n\nMenah Yem\'s mother joined the City Opera ( owned by Ong Peng Hock)\nafter she separated from her husband.\n\n\nSo Menah grew up with bangsawan performers as her larger family.\n\n\nShe sang in the chorus and replaced other, more experienced child\nactors when they fell ill.\n\n\nMat Arab ( Plate 31 ) , a famous comedian, now in his seventies,\nclaimed that he was left to fend for himself at an early age after both his\nparents died.\n\n\nHis father was an Arab who worked in the police force while his\nmother was a Malay woman from the kampong.\n\n\nWith no brothers or sisters to take care of him, Mat Arab followed a\nbangsawan man by the name of Haji Pokar, or \'Ging\', as he was commonly known.\n\n\nGing adopted Mat Arab as his son and brought him to Singapore where\nhe joined the City Opera.\n\n\n\'I went because I had no one to turn to.\n\n\nBesides, Ging said that it would be enjoyable,\' added Mat Arab.\n\n\nOther performers grew up in the midst of bangsawan activity.\n\n\nTheir parents were performers or proprietors of famous bangsawan\ncompanies.\n\n\nRahman B\'s father, Bakar M, was the proprietor of Rahman Star Opera,\nwhich was named after Rahman B ( Plate 33), the eldest son.\n\n\n THE PROMOTION OF STARS \n\n\nHis brother Rahim B ( Plate 34) and sister Rohani B also performed in\nthe troupe.\n\n\nMinah Alias ( Plate 35), a former heroine who is in her seventies and\nwho instructs the Bangsawan Sri USM today, came from a family of actors and\nperformers.\n\n\nHer grandfather was a shadow puppeteer ( dalang) in Java.\n\n\nHer father, Nani bin Haji Omar, started off as a dalang and an actor\nin the wayang wong ( orang) but joined the opera upon the invitation of a\nChinese opera owner.\n\n\nNani soon became a hero and a star in bangsawan and was sought after\nby women of all ethnic backgrounds.\n\n\nMinah\'s mother, Catharine de Brish, a foreigner, was one of these\nwomen.\n\n\nAfter watching Nani\'s performance, Catharine de Brish fell in love\nwith him, attending his performances every night, making eyes at Nani and\nthrowing flowers to him after the performances.\n\n\nWhen Catharine\'s brother forbade her to see Nani, she fell ill.\n\n\nNani and Catharine finally got married and she joined the bangsawan.\n\n\nIt was inevitable that Minah, coming from such a family, was to take\nup acting as well.\n\n\nThe late Alfonso Soliano, pianist and band leader of bangsawan, and\nlater conductor of the Orkes Radio Malaya, was a Filipino who came from a\nfamily of musicians.\n\n\nHis parents were among the sixty-four musicians engaged by the\nBritish government to form the Selangor State Band.\n\n\nWhen the Band disbanded in 1927, all the musicians except one stayed\non in Malaya.\n\n\nThese musicians played in night-clubs, hotels, cabarets, funeral\nbands, and in the bangsawan.\n\n\nSoliano\'s father, Rupino, a string bass player, performed with the\nLake Band which accompanied silent movies, and subsequently joined the\nbangsawan.\n\n\nThat was how Alfonso\'s whole family became involved in the\nbangsawan.\n\n\nSoliano\'s mother, Pacita, became a bangsawan singer, his two sisters\nwere dancers and singers, and his brother Jerry played the violin and later\nbecame a band leader.\n\n\nAlfonso himself studied under his father and brother and became a\nbangsawan pianist.\n\n\nYahya Sulong, a well-known comedian today, was literally born on the\nbangsawan stage of the New World Park about sixty years ago.\n\n\n\'My mother began to have labour pains when she was performing the\nstory " Panglima Alam Yahya".\n\n\nThat is why I was named Yahya,\' he said.\n\n\nThere were others who were so attracted to the bangsawan that they\nran away from their homes to join it.\n\n\nAbdullah Abdul Rahman\'s father had been a chief surveyor and wanted\nhim to finish his Senior Cambridge so that he could get a good job.\n\n\nBut Abdullah had been interested in acting since he was a child,\nhaving become familiar with bangsawan performances whenever they were staged\nat the park.\n\n\n\'After I finished my Junior Cambridge examinations, I decided to\nquit school to join the bangsawan.\n\n\nI did not dare tell my father.\n\n\nHe did not know where I was till he saw me on stage many years\nlater!\' Abdullah declared. \n\n\nMy bangsawan music teacher, Mat Hashim ( Plate 10), also joined a\nbangsawan troupe without his parents\' knowledge.\n\n\n\'I used to go to the performances of the Oriental Opera of Selangor\nevery night when it was playing in Butterworth,\' recalled the sixty-year-old\nMat.\n\n\n\'I made friends with the child actors and played with them after\nschool.\n\n\nWhen the troupe left, I followed them\'.\n\n\nRealizing that he would be punished for doing so, Mat did not dare\ngo home for the next four years.\n\n\nThe opera troupe fed and clothed him.\n\n\nFinally, there were some who were recruited by bangsawan troupes\nbecause of their skills as tailors or football players.\n\n\n( Bangsazvatl

{'text': 'Woman fined for driving with twin sister\'s IC and licence \n\n\nBy Tan Ooi Boon\n\n\nA WOMAN who did not have a driving licence thought she could fool the\npolice by driving with her twin sister\'s identity card and licence.\n\n\nBut what she did not count on was the police receiving earlier\ninformation on the ploy and setting a trap for her.\n\n\nYesterday, Lim Yan Peng 21, was fined a total of\n&dollar;7,000 and banned from driving for a year after she pleaded guilty to using\nher sister\'s identity card and driving licence illegally, driving her car\nwithout permission, driving without a licence and driving without insurance\ncoverage.\n\n\nUnder the law, a car insurance policy is not in force if the driver\ndoes not have a valid licence.\n\n\nThe court heard that on May 17, Traffic Police Corporal Jimmy Tiew,\nacting on a tip-off, waited outside Yan Peng\'s flat in Bukit Batok at about\n6.40 am.\n\n\nAt about 8 am, he saw Yan Peng driving her sister\'s car and he trailed\nher on his motorcycle.\n\n\nWhen they reached Hillview Avenue, the officer stopped her and asked\nfor her particulars.\n\n\nYan Peng showed him the licence and identity card of her twin sister,\nMiss Lim Yan Li.\n\n\nThe two sisters are not identical twins, but bear a resemblance to\neach other.\n\n\nCpl Tiew then called the Traffic Operations Room and had the identity\ncard screened.\n\n\nHe was instructed to bring the driver to the station.\n\n\nDuring questioning later, Yan Peng, who works in an electronic\ncompany, admitted that she had driven illegally using her sister\'s licence\nand identity card as she was late for work that day.\n\n\nHer sister, who was unaware of the incident, was away on an overseas\nbusiness trip.\n\n\nYesterday, Yan Peng told The Straits Times that she was Remorseful.\n\n\nShe said: " I am glad it is all over now.\n\n\nBut I just hope that the case will not affect my sister\'s career as\nshe was innocent and knew nothing about this".\n\n\nMiss Lim Yan Li was in court yesterday to help her sister pay the\nfines, but refused to comment. \n\n\n\n\n Black-market tickets may be fakes, say concert promoters \n\n\nby Dominic Nathan\n\n\nFIRST it was ticket scalpers.\n\n\nNow promoters of the Michael Jackson concert are warning fans about\nthe possibility of fake tickets.\n\n\nSaid a spokesman for the joint promoters, Lushington Entertainment\nand Sunvic Productions: " The public is strongly advised to purchase tickets\nonly from Sistic counters as security measures are factored into these\noriginal tickets".\n\n\nThe joint promoters declined to elaborate on the problem and\ncontinued to keep mum on another issue_a breakdown of the 60,000 public\ntickets according to the price range.\n\n\nBut sources said that the promoters, faced with criticism of the\ninitial preferential selling scheme under American Express and a growing\nblack-market situation, are considering holding a third show.\n\n\nThe promoters declined to comment on this.\n\n\nIn response to reports that\n&dollar;200 tickets were going for\n&dollar;400 on the black market, the promoters would only say: " We assure the\npublic that over 60,000 tickets for both nights across all categories will\nstill be available when public sales open".\n\n\nNo date was given for the sale of tickets to the public, but the\npromoters said that details will be announced shortly.\n\n\nThe promoters also warned members of the public not to purchase any\ntickets from touts.\n\n\nIn a statement, the joint promoters said: " Members of the public\nshould not purchase any tickets from touts who are presently selling tickets\nat blackmarket rates as this puts both buyer and seller in criminal\nviolation".\n\n\nA spokesman for the Customs and Excise Department said it was\nmonitoring the situation.\n\n\nUnder the law, reselling tickets and knowingly buying them is an\noffence, regardless of whether they are sold at the same price or at a profit\nand to whom they are sold.\n\n\nThe offence carries a fine of\n&dollar;500. \n\n\nSome 90,000 tickets, priced at\n&dollar;200,\n&dollar;125 and\n&dollar;65, are available for the concert, scheduled for Aug 29 and 30 at the\nNational Stadium.\n\n\nUnder an arrangement with the show\'s joint promoters, American\nExpress started selling tickets exclusively to its card members last\nWednesday.\n\n\nAll the\n&dollar;200 and\n&dollar;125 tickets were snapped up in three days.\n\n\nThere was no limit on the number of tickets each cardholder could\npurchase.\n\n\nCard members in Indonesia and Malaysia were also allowed to buy\ntickets through the priority booking system.\n\n\nThis led to fans complaining that there would not be enough good\nseats left for the public.\n\n\nAudience will be invited to join N-Day marchpast Also new is sea\ndisplay by civilian craft, naval divers by Dominic Nathan THE first\ninteractive National Day Parade - this is what this year\'s 28th National Day\nParade promises.\n\n\nSome 20,000 spectators at the Padang will literally be part of the\naction during the event as they will be invited to come down off the stands\nand onto the Padang to take the pledge and sing the national anthem.\n\n\nThey will then stage their very own marchpast in front of the\nPresident and other VIPs.\n\n\nThis segment, aptly called Nation on Parade, will be the highlight of\nthe event, which has " My Singapore, My Home" as its theme.\n\n\nA novel sea display is also planned for the parade, which will\ninclude the normal ceremonial and display segments.\n\n\nAt a press briefing on the overview of the parade concept, the\nchairman of the event\'s executive committee, Lieutenant-Colonel Lee Boon Loi,\nsaid:\n\n\n" This year\'s parade will be truly a \'people\'s parade\' as we take the\nconcept of audience participation a step further by bringing them into the\nthick of things on the Padang itself." The parade, which will start at 5.45\npm on Aug 9, is being organised by the Headquarters of the 8th Singapore\nArmoured Brigade.\n\n\nLt-Col Lee, who is also Chief of Staff of the Singapore Armed Forces\'\n3rd Division, outlined the other three main segments of the parade: The\ntraditional ceremonial segment: Designed to be simple yet solemn, this\nsegment will include the march-past and guard-of honour review by the\nPresident.\n\n\nAside from the military contingents, there will be Police, Civil\nDefence and school uniformed groups taking part.\n\n\nProviding the aerial action will be 20 Commando parachutists and four\nAir Force jets which will stage a flypast before breaking into bombburst\nformation.\n\n\nThe display segment: This will involve 450 school children and\nanother 2,100 athletes, including SEA Games sportsmen.\n\n\nThey will depict, through dance and music, the parade\'s foundation\ntheme - " Sound Education and Good Health in a Clean Environment".\n\n\nThe sea display segment: This will take the spectators from the\nPadang to the Marina Bay area.\n\n\nFast-paced action will be provided by all types of seacraft, from\npower boats and jet skis to canoes and dragon boats.\n\n\nNavy divers will also be dropped into the bay by helicopters in a\nmock rescue operation.\n\n\nFloats, fireworks and a light-up of all the seacraft and buildings in\nthe surrounding area will bring the parade to its close.\n\n\nThis will be followed by music and dancing during the post-parade\nparty.\n\n\nA multi-million dollar industry in songbirds by Dominic Nathan\nSINGAPORE imported 1.4 million birds last year, and they were not the kind\nthat end up in the curry.\n\n\nThey were mainly songbirds and other exotic species, and only 30,000\nof them were re-exported.\n\n\nThis means that 1.1 million birds ended up as pets in homes or are\nwaiting to be sold in bird shops here.\n\n\nWith about 700,000 households in Singapore, this works out to an\naverage of about 1.5 birds to each Singapore home.\n\n\nPrimary Production Department figures showed that the bird trade here\nwas worth\n&dollar;8 million last year.\n\n\nA PPD spokesman said that in addition to the sale of birds, there is\na\n&dollar;70 million industry dealing in cages, feed, medication and other\nbird-keeping accessories.\n\n\nThe\n&dollar;8 million, however, refers to the wholesale value of the birds.\n\n\nThe retail trade carried out in bird shops across the island will be\nworth several times more.\n\n\nSongbird hatchlings, which carry wholesale prices of\n&dollar;3 to\n&dollar;5, go for about\n&dollar;10 to\n&dollar;20 apiece at pet shops.\n\n\nA proven contest winner, however, may be worth about\n&dollar;500, and a blue-blooded champion songster, like a merbok, can fetch up to\n&dollar;100,000. \n\n\nAlthough no official figures are available, it is estimated\nthat more than 80 per cent of the birds imported by the 88 licensed bird\ndealers here are songbirds.\n\n\nBird keeping, especially of songbirds, is a popular pastime here,\nWith many bird-singing corners in housing estates.\n\n\nAccording to the PPD, the 10 most popular birds imported here last\nYear were: the Spotted Munia, White-headed Munia, Budgerigar, Yellow-Crowned\nBulbul, Zebra Dove, Black-headed Munia, Cockatiel, Hill Mynah, Pekin Robin\nand the Java Sparrow.\n\n\nAside from importing birds, some traders here have also turned to\ncaptive breeding as an alternative source of supply.\n\n\nBudgerigars, cockatiels, rosellas, canaries and other bird species\nare now being bred in large numbers and have even replaced the demand for\nbirds caught in the wild. \n\n\n\n\n HOME \n\n\n Dispute over trade in endangered wildlife \n\n\nProtected birds can be found in Singapore shops: Kwan  Records of\nmonitoring group used to back claim \n\n\nBy Dominic Nathan\n\n\nEXPORT of the popular song bird, Mata-Puteh, is banned in Malaysia.\n\n\nTrade in the Red-Whiskered Bulbul is not allowed in Thailand.\n\n\nBut they can still be found in bird shops in Singapore.\n\n\nEvidence of trade here in protected species has been tracked down and\nrecorded by the international wildlife monitoring agency, Traffic Southeast\nAsia, based in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\nMr Robert Kwan, chairman of the National Council on the Environment,\npresented these findings to The Straits Times on Friday.\n\n\nHe was backing his earlier claims that Singapore was a transhipment\ncentre in the illegal trade of endangered wildlife.\n\n\nThe Primary Production Department ( PPD) had asked Mr Kwan to\nsubstantiate his claim.\n\n\nIt maintained that illegal trade is not a problem here - Singapore\'s\nrecord on wildlife trade control is among the best in the world.\n\n\nIn presenting his evidence, Mr Kwan also said that Singapore needs to\nintroduce wider laws and plug existing legal loopholes to prevent protected\nspecies from being traded here.\n\n\nHe said that while the PPD is doing an excellent job in fulfilling\nSingapore\'s obligations under the Convention on International Trade in\nEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( Cites) more needs to be done.\n\n\nHe said: " Further legislation is required to support changing\nregional and international efforts at protecting trade in endangered and\nthreatened wildlife".\n\n\nCiting another Traffic finding, he said that Indonesia listed only 46\nspecies of birds as being approved for export.\n\n\nHowever, a survey of 46 bird shops here last year and this year found\nat least 150 species of native Indonesian birds being traded here.\n\n\nTraffic Southeast Asia is part of the Worldwide Traffic Network,\nwhich is supported by the World Wildlife Fund and the International Union for\nConservation of Nature.\n\n\nIt monitors trade in and the utilisation of wild plants and animals\nin co-operation with the Cites Secretariat.\n\n\nThe Council on the Environment, a voluntary non-governmental\norganisation, was formed in November 1990 to help the Government transform\nSingapore into a green city.\n\n\nIn a statement to the council, Mr Stephen Nash, director of Traffic\nSoutheast Asia said: " Singapore is an important gateway in Asia and illegal\ntrade does occur.\n\n\nThe fact that Singapore authorities continue to foil smuggling\nattempts is proof of this".\n\n\nHe said that although Singapore is making a sincere and concerted\neffort to stop the smuggling, there is a grey area about what is legal and\nillegal here.\n\n\nHe explained that much of Singapore\'s trade in parrots involves\nimporting and re-exporting birds from Indonesia.\n\n\nA check of bird shops here last year showed that 33 of 45 Indonesian\nparrot species traded here did not conform with Indonesian export quotas.\n\n\nThis technical1y violates Cites.\n\n\nSingapore should not have accepted the birds even if they had\nseemingly valid export permits, said Mr Nash.\n\n\nAnother legal technicality highlighted by Mr Nash involved birds\nleaving their country of origin illegally without proper export\ndocumentation. \n\n\nAfter only a short period of quarantine here, however, they are\nconsidered to be imported legally.\n\n\nHe said: " This is a serious loophole which can easily be abused".\n\n\nMr Kwan said the council is willing to work with the PPD and other\nrelevant authorities to help strengthen existing laws protecting wildlife and\nthe interests of the legitimate trade and the pet bird enthusiast.', 'subdomain': 'SINGAPORE_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1c4105b2-5f4a-4dfb-b19d-20eea66d0d17', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:56.880969+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9691033363342285, 'non_english_score': 0.030896663665771484}
{'text': 'The Sunday Times, June 6, 1993\n\n\nNEWS FOCUS Best programme for unskilled may be phased out within 5\nyears\n\n\n ITE doing comprehensive review of worker education courses \n\n\nBy Cephah Tan\n\n\nTHE Basic Education in Skills Training ( Best) programme for unskilled\nworkers to learn primary level English and Mathematics may be phased out\nwithin five years.\n\n\nBy 1998, 180,000 workers, or 80 per cent who need such training, would\nhave gone through it, said the Senior Minister of State ( Education) Dr Tay\nEng Soon yesterday.\n\n\nHe urged the 45,000 others who still lack basic education to sign up\nfor Best courses soon.\n\n\nDr Tay said the Institute of Technical Education ( ITE) had decided to\ndo a comprehensive review of its worker education programmes.\n\n\nHe is concerned that despite the growing number of trained workers\nhere, Singapore has dropped from 14th to 15th place in availability of\ntrained workers in countries.\n\n\n" We must reverse this.\n\n\nIn fact, we should aim for 12th or even 10th place," he said.\n\n\nThe rankings were determined by Business Environment Risk\nIntelligence ( Beri) a Washington-based risk analysis consultancy.\n\n\n" Since investors study Beri\'s findings, this will influence whether\nthey will come here or not, especially for those in high technology\nindustries," he said.\n\n\nDr Tay spoke at the 10th anniversary celebration of the Best\nprogramme.\n\n\nIt was also the graduation ceremony for those who had completed the\nBest programme and the \'Workers\' Improvement Through Secondary Education (\nWise) programme.\n\n\nWise teaches secondary level English and Mathematics.\n\n\nDr Tay said he hoped the review committee would consult Beri when\nsetting training targets.\n\n\nDr Law Song Seng, ITE\'s director, will chair the committee.\n\n\nIts members will come from the National Productivity Board, Skills\nDevelopment Fund, Economic Development Board, National Trades Union Congress\nand employers\' groups.\n\n\nThey will chart new directions for the next five years or more,\nexamine the programmes\' relevance and recommend improvements.\n\n\nDr Tay said the review is timely as regional competition for\ninvestments increases.\n\n\nHe said: " Our lowly educated, unskilled workers are becoming exposed\nand vulnerable.\n\n\nTheir counterparts in the region are willing to work for half or one\nthird of their salaries.\n\n\nThey will lose their unskilled jobs to them".\n\n\nBut if workers improve their education and skills, " the better jobs\nwill come to them and their real incomes can grow.\n\n\nContinuing education and training is not a matter of choice.\n\n\nIt could be a matter of their survival".\n\n\nHe said later that he was concerned about workers not going for\ntraining.\n\n\n" They say they have no time.\n\n\nI think they are being complacent...\n\n\nwe want to push them a bit harder," he said.\n\n\nCitizens and permanent residents with less than primary education\nformed 36 per cent of the population in 1980 but 31 per cent in 1990.\n\n\nAbout 130,000 workers or 8 per cent of the original target group of\n225,000 unskilled workers have attended at least one Best module since it\nstarted in 1983 and about 46,000 had completed all four.\n\n\nOf this number, 15,000 went on to higher level courses.\n\n\nA 191 survey also showed that nine out of 10 students found the Best\ncourse useful in their work and eight in 10 employers agreed this was so.\n\n\nDr Tay presented awards to C K Tang Limited, GM Singapore, the Port\nof Singapore Authority, Public Utilities Board and Singapore Bus Service for\nsupporting Best.\n\n\nThe Housing Board, Motorola Electronics, National Semiconductor\nManufacturer Singapore, Urban Redevelopment Authority and Boon Lay PAP\nCommunity Foundation Education Centre received special awards for supporting\nBest and Wise.\n\n\nTeachers and former Best students who went on to get higher\nqualifications also received awards.\n\n\nMadam Gait Bib, 40, a booking attendant for sports facilities: " I\nwent for Best classes in 1983.\n\n\nI went on to do the Wise programme and GCE N level in English.\n\n\nIf not for all these programmes, I would not be able to get this\njob".\n\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES Restaurants to discuss punctuality incentives By\nCephah Tan DISCOUNT packages for hosts who start Chinese wedding dinners on\ntime - these and other incentives to promote punctuality will be discussed by\n150 restaurant owners and managers tomorrow.\n\n\nFor the first time, a forum is being held at which participants from\nhotel food outlets and Chinese restaurants will discuss incentives for hosts\nwho support the punctuality drive.\n\n\nChinese wedding banquets have gained a bad reputation for starting as\nlate as two hours after the stipulated time because of habitual latecomers.\n\n\nAt the forum, to be held at the Hotel Equatorial, participants who\nhave managed to get dinners going earlier - between one and 1.5 hours after\nthe stipulated time - will share their tips on how they do it.\n\n\nMr Justin Chia, the executive director of the Restaurant Association\nof Singapore ( RAS), said: \'The main objective of the forum is to work out an\naction plan for our industry.\n\n\nWe hope that this plan will be adopted by all restaurants".\n\n\nThe forum is being organised by the Singapore Hotel Association (\nSHA), RAS and Singapore Restaurants Merchants Association.\n\n\nSuggestions offered there will be passed on to the National\nPunctuality Drive 1993 working committee and will be presented at a national\nforum on Community Actions for Punctuality.\n\n\nThe three-month drive, which will be launched by President Wee Kim\nWee on July 31, is aimed primarily at getting Chinese wedding dinners and\nNational Day and Seventh Moon Festival dinners to begin on the dot.\n\n\nAccording to the National Punctuality Drive 1993 working committee, a\nsurvey carried out last year showed that about 61 per cent of restaurants\nstarted their dinners at 8.45 pm, compared with 9 pm the year before.\n\n\nThe RAS\' Mr Chia said that despite the slight improvement in starting\ntimes, restaurants could serve meals on time only if all guests were\npunctual.\n\n\nHe said: " It is unproductive to have staff waiting for everyone to\narrive.\n\n\nIf they can finish their work early, they can go home early".\n\n\nThe forum is part of a series organised by various groups picked by\nthe working committee of the punctuality drive.\n\n\nSo far, one other forum has been held.\n\n\nOrganised by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (\nSCCCI) and the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations ( SFCCA), it\nthrew up these suggestions:\n\n\nSTART dinners promptly, but allow latecomers to tuck in later.\n\n\nREWARD early birds with lucky draws or gifts.\n\n\nIMPOSE a punctuality fine on latecomers, and give the money to\ncharity.\n\n\nTELEPHONE guests on the day of the dinner and remind them to be\nearly.\n\n\n\n\nPRINT the punctuality drive\'s rooster mascot on all invitation cards\nto remind guests that the function will start on the dot. \n\n\n\n\n No grace period for owners who sublet whole flat illegally HDB\nsays they \'must take immediate action to rectify situation\' \n\n\nBy Cephah Tan\n\n\nTHE Housing Board will not give owners who sublet their flats\nillegally a grace period to allow the owners\' tenants to find alternative\naccommodation.\n\n\nAn HDB spokesman, in reply to a Straits Times query, said: " Lessees\nwho have let out the whole flat must take immediate action to rectify the\nsituation.\n\n\nThey must stop letting out the whole flat and must physically occupy\nthe flat.\n\n\nThe HDB reply has dimmed the hopes of many jittery owners and\nsub-tenants who were warned again last Friday to stop illegal subletting.\n\n\nHouse agents who claim that there are at least 3000 flats being\nsublet illegally, said many tenants would have problems finding a home so\nquickly.\n\n\nAgents said some owners had asked them to terminate their rent as\nthey were now more afraid of the harsh penalties after the HDB warned of\nstiff action last week.\n\n\nThe board also said that 40 people lost their flats and another 80\nwere fined as much as\n&dollar;30,000 after being caught for subletting flats illegally.\n\n\nThe offenders were also banned from buying and renting an HDB flat\nfor five years.\n\n\nThe HDB has said it would continue to employ private investigators to\nnab culprits.\n\n\nIt would also report them to the Inland Revenue Authority of\nSingapore to check whether owners have paid tax for rental income.\n\n\nA house agent, who claims to have handled 300 rental cases within the\npast few years, said: " Illegal rental of flats is an open secret.\n\n\n" It\'s been around for years and people have taken it for granted.\n\n\nBut HDB seems to be more serious now.\n\n\nA few owners rang me up saying they\'d like to cancel their agreement\nwith tenants".\n\n\nThe HDB said flat owners could rent out their rooms but they\nthemselves must occupy at least one of the rooms.\n\n\nIt added that they should not buy an HDB flat if they do not need it\nin the first place as they would be depriving others of housing.\n\n\nSome owners argued that they were not depriving others of\naccommodation as they were willing to rent out their flats.\n\n\nThey had bought one because they needed it in the long-run.\n\n\nBut because of short-term commitments, they had to live with their\nfamily members and relatives elsewhere, they said.\n\n\nThey gave reasons like having to look after their sick parents,\nmoving in with relatives who babysit their children but who do not want to\nmove out, and living with relatives so that their children could attend\nnearby day-care centres or kindergartens.\n\n\nSo, they would rather rent out their flat to earn some income during\ntheir short absence, than leave it vacant.\n\n\nSaid one man " We didn\'t know that renting the whole flat was\nillegal.\n\n\nMy parents rented out their flat and are staying with us so that we\ncan look after them.\n\n\nBesides they can make some money.\' Another owner, a secretary, said: "\nWe are now living at my mother-in-law\'s flat because my son attends a\nkindergarten near her flat.\n\n\nThere isn\'t a kindergarten in our estate.\n\n\nBut when my son grows up, we will shift back".\n\n\nHouse agents said those who took up the apartments were mostly\nforeign workers, permanent residents and foreign students.\n\n\nThe rest were Singaporeans, including people who failed to obtain a\nflat, singles, those waiting for their flats to be built or those whose flats\nwere under renovation.\n\n\nHouse agents felt that the board should legalise subletting of whole\nflats as long as owners paid tax for their rental income.\n\n\nOne agent wondered whether the HDB could provide alternative\naccommodation for the sub-tenants if they were evicted.\n\n\nHe believed that most foreign workers and employers who provided\nhousing for staff would not be able to afford private housing.\n\n\nA reader who wrote to The Straits Times Forum Page yesterday said the\nHDB and government departments should formulate housing plans according to\nthe needs of foreign workers and permanent residents too.\n\n\nThey could start by keeping a register of their addresses.\n\n\nSaid one house agent: " There are thousands of foreign workers\noccupying such flats.\n\n\nThere are Malaysians working in factories and hotels, foreign\nstudents, Hongkong immigrants, Indian and Chinese professionals".\n\n\nIn reply, the HDB spokesman pointed out that tenants could continue\nliving in the same flat together with the owner, but not occupy all the\nbedrooms.\n\n\nEach case judged on merit · ELDERLY owners can sublet their flat and\nlive with their children elsewhere if they are extremely ill and require\nconstant medical attention.\n\n\nThey must have good reasons like these.\n\n\nBut they cannot rent it out just because they want to live with\ntheir children or grandchildren.\n\n\nTHE board may consider allowing owners to sublet their flat if they\nand their families are required to live in company quarters elsewhere.\n\n\nOWNERS can let the whole flat when they and their families live\nabroad because of their jobs or studies.\n\n\nThe board said as each case is considered on its own merit,\nPermission is granted on a case by case basis.\n\n\nIt is also subject to periodical review.\n\n\nOwners must get approval from HDB branch offices before subletting.\n\n\nThe HDB itself rents out whole flats under two arrangements:\n\n\nUNDER its integrated non-citizen housing scheme, permanent residents\nand non-citizens with professional employment passes and skilled work permits\ncan rent a whole flat from the Housing Board. \n\n\nBut the applications must be supported by the Finance Ministry.\n\n\n\n\nCOMPANIES in the construction industry, engineering and\nmanufacturing can also rent whole flats for their unskilled workers from the\nHousing Board.\n\n\nTheir applications must be supported by the Economic Development\nBoard or the Construction Industry Development Board.', 'subdomain':
