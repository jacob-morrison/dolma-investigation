{"text": "COVER STORY   \n\n\n  POLLINATION : THE FOUNTAINHEAD OF LIFE     \n\n \n\n  THE    peepal \ntree,   Ficus religiosa   , also known as \nashwattha  , is a sacred tree for most Hindus and is also revered by\nBuddhists.\n\n\nThis tree, found so commonly all over India, is home for a species of\nwasp - -   Blastophaga quadraticeps   .\n\n\nThe female wasp enters a receptacle on which the   Ficus\n  flower is borne, and  breeds.\n\n\nAs part of this breeding cycle pollination of the fig-flower is\neffected. \n\n \n\n Jaiphal  (   Myristica fragrans\n  ) is pollinated by abeetle called  \nFormicomus braminus   , so named because in Latin, \n\" formica\"  means \" ant \" , and the beetle is\nant-like in behaviour and appearance, except for its flight pattern, which\nis active and strong.\n\n\nThe hairy body collects pollen while moving about inside the male\nflower.\n\n\nDuring attempts to enter the female flower the beetle pollinates the\nstigma.\n\n\nThis would be classed as a specialized beetle-pollinated system. \n\n \n\nThe  papaya  tree (   Carica papaya\n  ) has a very interesting method of pollination.\n\n\nIt gets pollinated by mistake.\n\n\nHere, the male and female flowers are borne on different trees.\n\n\nThe male flower offers both pollen and nectar to the insect or bird\nwhich visits it, whereas the female flower has nothing to offer.\n\n\nYet the female gets pollinated and sets fruit and seed.\n\n\nThis is because one of the many insects which visit the flowers, a\nhawkmoth, also visits the female flower by chance, thus pollinating it. \n\n \n\n  POLLINATION   , in simplistic\nterms, is the transference of pollen from an anther onto a stigma - - in\nother words, the transfer of the male component of a flower to the female\none.\n\n\nWhat would at a glance seem like so uncluttered and easy a process is\nactually one of the most powerful triggers that nature possesses.\n\n\nA trigger that sets into motion a gamut of the most varied and\nfascinating mechanisms in the whole world of living things.\n\n\nIt is pollination that allows a plant to set fruit and seed; in\nessence, to reproduce and perpetuate. \n\n \n\nIt can be said that pollination has brought about a revolution in\nthe human perception of flowers, insects and birds.\n\n\nHow many of us have \n really tried to understand the\nreason behind an observation so routine and seemingly so mundane as a\nbutterfly alighting on a brightly coloured flower or a sunbird flitting\namidst bottle-brush blossoms?\n\n\nPollination of a flower can never occur in isolation.\n\n\nIn fact, it takes place in an intricate habitat of rather amazing\ncomplexity, an ecosystem with populations of plants and animals,\ninterdependent and competing.\n\n\nThis fact accentuates the importance of pollination, widening its\nscope and significance in life. \n\n \n\n  WHEN   Darwin examined the\nMadagascar Star orchid,   Anagraecum sesquipedale \n , which has 25-30 cm long spur and contains nectar, he predicted\npollination by some giant hawkmoth.\n\n\nIt was in 1903, 40 years after  observations were\npublished in  \" On the Origin of Species \"  in\n1859, that the hawkmoth fitting this description   Xanthopan\nmorgani  f.   praedicta   was discovered.\n\n\nThe average spur length in the orchid is 28-32 cm and length of\n proboscis  or the tongue in the hawkmoth reaches about 25\ncm.\n\n\nEarlier considered only as a fanciful though absorbing anecdote,\n inferences from the Madagascar Star orchid are today\nthe focal point of the general theory of co-evo-lution between animals and\nflowering plants. \n\n \n\nThe historical facts about flowers - - or rather about flowering\nplants - - are enshrouded in mystery. \n\n\nFossil evidence is patchy and the story that rocks have to tell is\nmore of blanks and less of tangible truth.\n\n\nYet, one does believe that in the Upper ( etaceous period of the\ngeological time scale plants with flowers - - the angiosperms - - dominated\n vegetation.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that the evolution of flowering plants has\nfollowed a path of close co-evolution with insects, right from the\nbeginning - - bringing one round to the all important phenomenon of\npollination.\n\n\nEvolutionarily speaking, however, pollination is not unique to these\nhigher plants; it is something which is found to occur almost throughout the\ngreen world, from algae upwards, and the reproducible unit is essentially\nuniform.\n\n\nBut the spores of lower plants are different from the pollen grains\nof higher plants in that they can germinate in a fairly wide choice of\nplaces.\n\n\nThe pollen grain is relatively more selective, germinating only on\nthe right stigma.\n\n\nIt is perhaps this absolute   need for tremendous precision in pollen grains that has\nbeen the driving force in the evolution of such highly sophisticated\nadaptations between a flower and its pollinator. \n\n \n\n  THAT   a flower can become a fruit\nafter pollination was known to man long before modern science developed.\n\n\nTalking of antiguity of such knowledge, Theophrastus who lived\nbetween 373 and 285 B.C. knew that the date-palm (   Phoenix\ndactylifera   ) gives a better harvest if the flowers from\nthe male tree ( the male and female trees in the date-palm are separate,\ni.e., it is a unisexual tree ) are dusted over the female tree when it is\njust about setting fruit.\n\n\nThis also meant that most Greek and Roman writers knew of this need\nfor pollination in the date palm.\n\n\nThrough the ages, after these early writings, the idea grew and in\nthe 17th century Rudolph Jacob Camerarius, a professor at Tubingen in\nGermany, thought of an elegant experiment to demonstrate the importance of\nsex in plants.\n\n\nOn removing the anthers - - the male component - - from the\nbisexual flower of the castor oil plant (  Ricinus communis  ) , he\nfound, the flower did not form a fruit at all.\n\n\nThe world took its own time to accept the truth in this discovery.\n\n\nOf course, by the mid-18th century, pollination had become a\nsystematic discipline and by the start of the 19th century, Darwin published\nmany papers on this intriguing subject. \n\n \n\nAfter so many years of curiosity, pollination still amazes the\nnaturalist, the casual observer, and even the pollination biologist!\n\n\nAnd why not?\n\n\nPollination of a flower culminates in a fruit and seed, and it is the\nseed that sustains all life.\n\n\nIt is this seed which has aided human civilization in unlimited ways.\n\n\n \n\nThere is an incredible variety of flowers in nature.\n\n\nThey differ in size, shape, colour, smell, and some in their\nfunction.\n\n\nSuch variations are the basis of diversity which is pivotal in\ndefining the dynamics of life itself.\n\n\nSuch diversity also reflects itself in the large number of\npollination mechanisms that exist. \n\n \n\n  POLLINATIONS   may occur in\nabsolute purity of surroundings - - within one flower.\n\n\nKnown as self-pollination for obvious reasons here the pollen grains\nof a flower pollinate their own stigma, managing thus, to produce a pure\nseed with no  \" contamination\"  from outside.\n\n\nSelfing, Charles Darwin is known to have said, is always disliked\nby nature.\n\n\nBut there is a variety of small, herbaceous plants which are\nself-pollinated.\n\n\nA plant which has perhaps shaped and directed human civilization\nis wheat (   Triticum   spp.  ) .\n\n\nThis vital grass has a self-pollinated flower, and each flower is an\nindependent  unit which is totally capable\nof producing a grain without any help from outside its micro-environment.\n\n\nSuch self-pollination and fertilization is generally a\nstrategy used by plants with a short life cycle - - the annuals.\n\n\nBy adapting thus, the plant is actually minimizing the risk of\ndepending on any external factor for pollination. \n\n \n\nWith so much diversity in life it is perhaps not surprising that\nthere is another class of flowers which, even though they are totally\nself-pollinated, still need the impetus of an insect visit to actually get\npollinated.\n\n\nMany legume flowers need such trigger.\n\n\nFloral architecture in such flowers is so fashioned that unless an\ninsect alights on the flower and mechanically forces the pollen onto the\nstigma, pollination does not occur.\n\n\nThis activity is very aptly known as  \" tripping\"  ,\nwhereby the insect trips the pollen onto the stigma.\n\n\nThen there is the tomato flower (   Lycopersicon\nesculentum   ) which, though self-pollinated, needs   an\ninsect to visit and bring the pollen onto the stigma. \n\n \n\n  POLLINATION   is a truly\nflexible natural phenomenon which can occur under a diverse range of\nphysical conditions.\n\n\nThere is a kind of flower known as cleistogamous flower where the\nvery basic process of  ` opening'  is redundant.\n\n\nThe flower   does not at any point in its cycle, show its reproductive parts.\n\n\n  \" Cleisto\"   in Greek is \n\" hidden\"  , and   \" gamy\"   is\n \" marriage\"  , and such flowers are purely self-pollinated.\n\n\nBut then why should a flower be cleistogamous when evolutionarily it\nwould be more advantageous to become cross-fertilized?\n\n\nSuch flowers - - which look like small buds - - are produced when\nenvironmental conditions are adverse and the plant is unable to produce\nlarge,  ` normal'  , or chasmogamous flower.\n\n\nThis is a classic case of adaptation by plants to ensure seed set\neven in harsh climatic conditions, like the plant   Viola\nmirabilis   the famous violet flower. \n\n \n\nA plant of South American origin called  \" Ruellia\n\"  produce conspicuous bell-shaped violet flowers right through\nthe summer in India, but once the cold weather sets in the flowers are just\ngreen buds never once opening.\n\n\nThe beauty is that both kinds of flowers produce fruit and seed which\nhave the full capability  to grow into plants.\n\n\nThere are times when such selfing occurs for the simple reason that\npollinators are not available.\n\n\nIn the harsh cold clime of the northwestern British Isles where no\ninsects are able to survive, the flowers of a plant called  Pinguicula\n , otherwise insect-pollinated, are regularly selfed.\n\n\nPlants and Nature alike, leave nothing to chance.   \n\n \n\nNature excels in intriguing mechanisms, all evolved rationally\nover time.\n\n\nIsn't it surprising that a vast number of plants have strategies\nwhich allow them to be a cut above those which are self-pollinated?\n\n\nThese plants set seed only when cross-fertilized - - when their\nstigma gets pollinated only by pollen from another individual, of the same\nspecies, of course.\n\n\nSuch cross-breeding   naturally encourages a\nheterogenous character in the offspring - - characters which, being a\nmixture, make these offspring more fit than their self-fertilized compariots!\n\n\nBut such crossing - - also known as out-crossing for obvious\nreasons - - is not easy to achieve.\n\n\nFor the plant it implies a high degree of adaptation, with the use of\nrefined strategies to be able to attract pollen from an external source\n- - sometimes really distant.\n\n\nHere begins one of the most wondrous stories of synchrony and\nharmonization in Nature - - that of a flower and its pollinator. \n\n \n\nPollinators - - pivots in the fertilization process - - are,\nin a wider perspective, known as agents of pollination.\n\n\nThese natural agents show a tremendous range in their character, from\nthe non - - living to the living,  from rain and\nwind to birds, ants, beetles, bees and butterflies and, sometimes, even\nrodents and bats.\n\n\nThese pollinators - - known thus because they actually bring about\npollination by their actions - - are of as much significance as the flowers\nthemselves.\n\n\nNow, one looks at a relationship between a plant and its\npollinator, not one particular organism in isolation.\n\n\nThis relationship, manifested in a multitude of ways, can be seen\nevery day, every time a butterfly alights on a flower or a Purple sunbird\nhovers in the coral  canopy. \n\n \n\n A  honey-bee visits the Hollyhock, an ornamental\nplant with brightly coloured flowers in the small green patch outside your\nhouse.\n\n\nThis bee, known for its aggressive nature and rather potent sting, is\n Apis  sp.\n\n\nIs the visit casual, a chance happening?\n\n\nOr is it highly programmed, a specific visit to a specific flower for\na specific purpose?\n\n\nBy bringing pollen from another plant and managing to dust this\npollen onto the stigma of this flower, the plant is allowed to reproduce,\nbut what is the  part of the bargain?\n\n\nNature functions with an incredible degree of frugality and planning,\nwith nothing happening without a reason.\n\n\nSo the bee surely gets something in return, but, what?\n\n\nIn the finely tuned environment of the flower and the bee, what is\nactually taking place is something that involves a highlevel transfer of\nbio-energy, and - coadaptation, the chemistry of floral rewards and\nthe changes brought about by pollination.\n\n\nThe bee expends a fair amount of its energy in bringing pollen to a\nflower from a distant source.\n\n\nIs this energy replenished?\n\n\nBy nectar or pollen?\n\n\nAre these commodities food for the bee-food of sufficient\nnutritional value and economy to make the bee work so hard to receive\nthese rewards? \n\n \n\nNectar and pollen have been shown and proved with considerable\nevidence to be rich sources of energy for insects.\n\n\nBoth these components of flowers are chemically rich; nectar\ncontains amino acids and sugars and pollen contains starch and protein.\n\n\nThese are the rewards; a bee or a butterfly goes in search of\nnectar, alights on a flower, inserts its  proboscis  or\ntongue to collect nectar from the base of the flower, but in the process gets\ncoated with pollen from the same flower.\n\n\nIn fact, a large number of insects have special pollen sacs on their\nbodies.\n\n\nThe insects sucks   the flower dry and moves to a fresh flower.\n\n\nThe story repeats itself, but this time, the pollen already on the\nbody of the insect gets dusted onto the stigma of the second flower.\n\n\nThis seemingly small action sets into motion a physiologically very\npowerful series of events - - pollen grains germinate on the stigma and\npollen tubes are formed, which grow right down to the ovary, and these tubes\ncarry the male gametes.\n\n\nFusion occurs, causing one ovule to be fertilized by one such\ngamete.\n\n\nThe story of the seed thus begins. \n\n \n\nYet, there is one question, what is it that attracts an insect\nto a flower?\n\n\nThis brings us to an intriguing part of this story - - the\nattractants - - usually floral colour and fragrance.\n\n\nThese attractants are important because they are the initiators of\nthe chain of events leading to pollination.\n\n\nThe visual sense of insects is quite different from that of\nhumans.\n\n\nFor example, an  visual spectrum allows\nultraviolet vision.\n\n\nWhat the human eye sees as green, is red to the insect, blue of\nhuman definition is green to an insect, and yellow is violet.\n\n\nThis visual aid, which even humans use to such a large extent, is a\npowerful initial attractant.\n\n\nSo also is odour, except that the olfactory sense of insects do not\ndiffer all that much from that of humans. \n\n \n\nThe olfactory sense is perhaps the strongest of all the senses\nin human beings, so also with insects.\n\n\nIt is intriguing that odour has been an attractant much before the\nvisual aid became evolutionarily prominent.\n\n\nBeetle pollination is known to be primitive and flowers thus\npollinated are strong smelling.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "db5de720-c6a6-4bdf-b190-40cf146ead95", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.002283+00:00"}
{"text": "SPACEWATCH  \n\n\n  KILLER STREAKERS  FROM THE SKY ? \n    \n\n \n\n  ENVISIONING   scenarios of the\nend of life on our planet is a favourite preoccupation of doomsday\nprophets.\n\n\nNuclear war, natural disasters, attack from extra-terrestrial\nbeings - - all these have been the subjects of science fiction stories.\n\n\nTo this list can now be added one more possibility: an asteroid\nimpact.\n\n\nThe butt of ridicule only a few years ago, the potential of an\nasteroid to cause large-scale destruction is now being increasingly realized\nby both the scientific community and the public.\n\n\nA study conducted in 1980 showed strong evidence that an asteroid\nimpact wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.\n\n\nThe pictures beamed by the spacecraft Voyager 2 on its encounters\nwith the outer planets and their satellites established that many planetary\nbodies in the solar system were subjected to repeated asteroid impacts, and\nsome even broke up. \n\n \n\nEvidence of asteroids colliding with the Earth has been piling\nup, ever since a US mining engineer, Daniel Barringer, suggested in 1906 that\nthe crater in the Arizona desert was caused by a meteorite impact.\n\n\nNearly 50 years later, the US planetary geologist Eugene\nSchoemaker proved that the crater had been made nearly 50,000 years ago by\nthe impact of a meteor about 150 m long.\n\n\nSince then, nearly 200 impact craters have been discovered in several\ncountries including India, Brazil and Ghana. \n\n \n\nThe Lonar crater in Buldana district of Maharashtra was also made\nby a    meteor impact nearly 50,000 years ago.\n\n\nThe most recent asteroidal impact occurred in 1908 near the\nTunguska river in Siberia.\n\n\nThe collision, which was heard 800 km away, destroyed a large area\nof the forest around and set the night sky of Europe aglow for days.\n\n\nCratering is a dominant geological process in the solar system,\nalthough it is a rare event in human experience.\n\n\nFrom where do asteroids and meteors originate? \n\n \n\nOn January 1, 1801, a Sicilian astronomer Guiseppe Piazzi\nspotted a small body in the huge vacant space between Mars and Jupiter,\nabout 2.8 astronomical units ( AU) from the Earth ( one AU is the distance\nbetween the Earth and the Sun).\n\n\nHe named it after the Sicilian goddess Ceres.\n\n\nA year later, the German astronomer Heinrich Olbers spotted another\ntiny body at the same location, and named it Pallas.\n\n\nIn the next few years two more such bodies, Juno and Vesta, were\ndiscovered.\n\n\nThe famous 18th century British astronomer Sir William Herschel\ncalled these bodies asteroids.\n\n\n Asteroid  in Greek means star-like; seen through the\nlargest 19th century telescopes, asteroids appeared as mere points of light.\n\n\n \n\nThe discovery of Ceres and the other asteroids puzzled\nastronomers, as they had expected to find a planet in the gap between Mars\nand Jupiter, as suggested by  formula.\n\n\nIn the early 1770s, Johann Bode, director of the Berlin Observatory,\ncame across a rule for planetary orbits formulated by the German\nmathematician Johann Titius in 1766.\n\n\nTitius had stated that if the distance between the Sun and Saturn is\ntaken to be 100 units, then  Mercury is 4 units away\nfrom the Sun, Venus is 7 units distant, the Earth, Mars and Jupiter are 10,\n15 and 52 units away.\n\n\n( Saturn was the furthest planet then known. )\n\n\nTitius found a vacant gap between Mars and Jupiter, at a distance of\n28 units from the Sun.\n\n\nBode was so impressed with  formula that he\npublicized it, without, however, giving any credit to its originator, and\nthe rule came to be known as  formula of planetary\ndistances. \n\n \n\nWhen Bode extended the formula, he found that it did, indeed,\ngive the distance of Uranus, discovered in 1781.\n\n\nThe absence of a planet, and the discovery of some more asteroids, at\n28 units, gave Olbers the idea that the latter were the remnants of a planet\nthat had somehow broken up.\n\n\nHowever, Olbers had no clue as to how the planet had\ndisintegrated, and the mystery remained unsolved. \n\n \n\n broken-planet theory, although unsubstantiated,\nwas used nearly 150 years later by the Dutch astronomer J.H. Oort to explain\nhis own hypothesis of the distribution of long-period comets, which have\nperiods of thousands of years.\n\n\nIn 1950, after studying 19 long-period comets, Oort concluded that\nthese bodies actually came from a huge cloud of comets about 100,000 AU\nfrom the Sun, circumscribing    the solar system.\n\n\nStellar perturbations threw some of these comets inwards where they\nwere captured by the gravitational attraction of the Sun and the giant\nplanets and became members of the solar family.\n\n\nIn order to explain how the comets first gathered to a form a cloud,\nOort drew on  idea that a planet that had existed between\nMars and Jupiter somehow broke up.\n\n\nAs it exploded, he hypothesized, the more energetic fragments were\nflung far out and formed the Oort cloud of comets.\n\n\nHowever, the actual physical mechanism which caused the planet to\nexplode, and the composition of the fragments which had undergone such a\nviolent upheaval still remained unknown. \n\n \n\nAt this point, it is essential to establish the correlation\nbetween comets, asteroids and meteorites.\n\n\nScientists believe that asteroids are simple dead comets and that\nmeteor showers are from the left-over of comets in their orbits.\n\n\nThus asteroids are simple more evolved comets.\n\n\nThere is also some evidence that comets, asteroids and meteorites\nbelong to the same family of bodies in the solar system.\n\n\nMany comets show distinct asteroidal properties, and there are\nasteroids which display cometary characteristics. \n\n \n\nThere are several theories about the distribution and origin of\ncomets.\n\n\nIn the 1960s, the US planetary scientist Gerard Kuiper hypothesized\nthat there may be a belt of comets just outside the orbit of Pluto.\n\n\nTo explain the origin of the Kuiper belt, Fred Whipple of the\nSmithsonian Astrophysical Centre, USA, also known to his colleagues as the\ncomet Pope, suggested that when Uranus and Neptune were formed, they threw\nout the remaining planetesimals    just outside the orbit of Pluto.\n\n\nAlthough there are problems with this theory as well, astronomers\nbelieve that the Kuiper belt of comets does exist and that it is just the\nbeginning of the larger Oort cloud. \n\n Then there are the short-period comets in the solar system.\n\n\nAccording to astronomers, these were longperiod comets which were\ngravitationally captured when they entered the solar system and\nthrereafter became short-period comets.\n\n\nThis theory, however, accounts for only a small fraction of the\nnumber of such comets observed.\n\n\nComets which have an extremely short period, from 2 to 10 years,\nare called families of asteroids associated with the inner planets.\n\n\nMercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.\n\n\nThese include planet-crossing asteroids, nearSun and near-Earth\nasteroids. \n\n \n\nNear-Earth asteroids move about near the  orbit.\n\n\nApollo and Amor asteroids belong to this category.\n\n\nThe Apollo-type asteroids are small objects that move about in the\nvicinity of the  orbit.\n\n\nAmor asteroids are found between the orbits of the Earth and Mars.\n\n\nApollo and Amor bodies often cross the  orbit.\n\n\nAten asteroids orbit the Sun and stay very close to it.\n\n\nToro asteroids vacillate between the orbits of the Earth and Venus.\n\n\n \n\nAsteroids are also classified according   to their\ncomposition.\n\n\nSome are giant C-type carbonaceous chondrites - - stony bodies\ncontaining small mineral granules.\n\n\nSome others, called S-type asteroids, are made of silicates rich in\niron and magnesium; their spectral lines show a reddish tinge, probably due\nto the presence of a pure nickel-iron alloy.\n\n\nA third type of asteroids, which are coated with ice, also have a\nreddish tinge, but they show no evidence of other minerals.\n\n\nS-type bodies are distributed in the inner region of the main\nasteroid belt, towards the Sun.\n\n\nC-type asteroids inhabit the middle portion of the belt, and the\nicecoated asteroids are found at the outer fringes of the belt, close to\nJupiter. \n\n\n  Chances of a hit  \n\n \n\nNear-Earth asteroids are not the only ones which can strike the\nEarth.\n\n\nHowever, by virtue of being near the  orbit, they\nhave potential to hit when in a particular configuration, subject to the\ngravitational field and resonance of the Sun and other planets.\n\n\nThe asteroids that collide with the Earth, or any other planet or\nsatellite, may be from the main asteroid  belt,\nor from the Trojan clouds at the Lagrangian points associated with planetary\norbits ( see box on p.20) or even from the Oort cloud. \n\n \n\nThe result of an asteroid impact depends on the velocity,\nprojectile mass, angle of impact and the surface material strength of the\nprojectile and the target.\n\n\nThe Barringer crater, mentioned earlier, which was made by a 150-m\nlong asteroid, has a diameter of 1,200 m and is 180 m deep, with a 45-m high\nearth-collar rising around it.\n\n\nThe Lonar crater is a depression 1,830 m across and 150 m deep.\n\n\nAn asteroid 1-2 km long would have a catastrophic impact.\n\n\nThe collision of a body about 10 km across will bring about mass\nextinction of life on our planet.\n\n\nThe impact would throw millions of tons of sand, soil and dust\ninto the atmosphere blocking out sunlight, and choke out life. \n\n \n\nWhat are the chances of an asteroid striking the Earth in our\nlife - - time?\n\n\nStatistically speaking, an asteroid 50 m across strikes every 100-200\nyears.\n\n\nA slightly bigger one of about 150 m comes down once in 50,000 to\n100,000 years.\n\n\nA really big one, about 2-3 km across, can be expected once in\n250,000 years.\n\n\nHowever, the possibility of an actual collision is not as\nfar-fetched as the figures seem to indicate.\n\n\nIn 1989, a nearly one-km-long missile crossed the \norbit at a point where the planet had been a mere six hours earlier, a\nwhisker in astronomical terms.\n\n\nHad it struck, the energy released would have been equivalent to\n1,000 one-megaton bombs.\n\n\nIn January 1991, another asteroid passed within 160,000 km of the\nEarth.\n\n\nIn 1937, the asteroid Hermes missed the Earth by less than twice the\ndistance to the Moon. \n\n \n\nWith growing evidence of the possibility of an asteroid\ncollision, as well as the detection of more Earth-crossing asteroids,\ngreater effort is being made to track these bodies.\n\n\nAstronomers Tom Gehrels and Jim Scotti at the Kit Peak National\nObservatory, USA, are scouring the skies with a 36-inch reflecting\ntelescope equipped with a charge-coupled device camera.\n\n\nAn estimated 2,000 Earth-crossing asteroids are believed to be\nmoving dangerously close to our planet.\n\n\nGehrels says that four 36-inch telescopes spread around the globe\nwould be able to track down nearly 90 per cent of these within the next 10\nyears.\n\n\nThe Anglo-Australian near-Earth asteroid survey was instituted in\nAustralia in May 1990 to open up a vista from the southern hemisphere.\n\n\nA number of near-Earth asteroids have been discovered under this\nproject. \n\n \n\nIf one is seen coming perilously close to the Earth, there are\ntwo possible ways of avoiding a collision.\n\n\nOne is to launch a missile that will break up the asteroid in\nmid-air.\n\n\nSuch a course would, however, rain debris on the Earth, causing\nconsiderable damage.\n\n\nA more feasible solution is to launch a rocket which will divert the\ncourse of the incoming projectile. \n\n \n\nThere is another, equally important, reason to observe and study\nasteroids.\n\n\nScientists believe that main-belt asteroids are primordial material\nthat failed to accrete and form a planet.\n\n\nThe material in comets, asteroids and meteorites are the basic\nbuilding blocks of    all\nbodies in the solar system; thus studying them can give invaluable clues to\nthe formation of the planetary system and the conditions that prevailed at\nits inception.\n\n\nAny good theory of the formation of the solar system must\nsatisfactorily explain the origin, evolution and structure of comets,\nasteroids and meteorites, their families and interrelationships. \n\n \n\nSeveral projects have been designed for the study fo\nasteroids.\n\n\nSome well-known asteroids have been targeted for special study.\n\n\nIn October 1991, the spacecraft Galileo, launched by the   US National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration ( NASA ) , made the first ever flyby of an asteroid, when it\npassed within, 1,600 km of Gaspra.\n\n\n sophisticated sensors - - a spectrometer,\nradiometer and polarimeter - - investigated the asteroid which is about\nthe size of the Martian moon Diemos.\n\n\nGaspra showed up as having a cratered, irregular surface, with 20\nper cent reflectivity and a rotational period of 7.04 hours.\n\n\nIt is an S-type asteroid composed of pure metal and metal-rich\nsilicates.\n\n\nGalileo will also study another S-type asteroid, Ida,  en route\n to Jupiter. \n\n \n\nPreliminary plans are under way for dedicated missions to\nnear-Earth asteroids.\n\n\nThe Italian Space  project is named Piazzi.\n\n\nOne of the prime targets of this project is the asteroid Eros.\n\n\nWith a diameter of nearly 20 km, Eros is the second largest\nnear-Earth asteroid so far discovered ( Ganymed is the largest, about 30\nkm across).\n\n\nThis body frequently appears close to the Earth, enabling\nastronomers to determine its orbital elements.\n\n\nTherefore, astronomers already have some understanding of its\nphysical and geometric characteristics, especially its shape and\nrotational axis, which should provide a useful background for an in-depth\nstudy. \n\n \n\nCassini,  space mission to Saturn, which is\nexpected to be launched in 1996, will also study asteroids.\n\n\nThe Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico can image main-belt\nasteroids.\n\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope should also provide detailed images as\nwell as mineralogical information about asteroids.\n\n\nThus, we can hope to have a rich treasure trove of information in\ntime to celebrate the bicentennial of the discovery of the first asteroid - -\nJanuary 1, 2001.  <logo>    \n <box>  THE\nLAGRANGIAN POINTS \n\n \n\n  Joseph   Lagrange, (\n1736-1813), a French mathematician, attempted to solve the problem of the net\ngravitation of a system involving three bodies.\n\n\nIn order to simplify his task, Lagrange set the condition that the\nmass of the third body should be extremely small compared to those of the\nother two.\n\n\nThus, the three bodies in the system could be the Sun, a planet and\na satellite or a comet.\n\n\n( One cannot consider a system involving the Sun and two planets or\nthe Sun and two stars. )\n\n\nThis is  restricted three-body problem, for which\nhe found five solutions.\n\n\nThese are points in space where the net gravitational force is zero\n( see diagram).\n\n\nOf the five Lagrangian points, L4 and L5 are\nstable, while the other three are unstable. \n\n \n\nEvery planet in the solar system has associated Lagrangian\npoints.\n\n\nThe primordial matter of the solar system which gathered at these\npoints remained there undisturbed for millions of years, as they\nexperienced no gravitational force.\n\n\nThese are called Trojan bodies.\n\n\nNearly 1,000 Trojan asteroids have been discovered at  Lagrangian   points and many more\nstill are believed to be there.\n\n\nTrojan bodies have also been found at the Lagrangian points of the\nEarth and Mars, and  moons Dione and Tethys. \n\n \n\nAt a certain configuration of the Sun and planets, these\nhitherto undisturbed bodies leak out of their Lagrangian locations and\nbecome members of the solar system.\n\n\nSome of these may also rain down on the planets and their\nsatellites.  </box>  <&>\n\n\n Asteroid collisions are also interwoven with mythology.\n\n\nThis is Ganga-Bhogavati  sangam  , or Vishnu Gaya,\nin Buldana.\n\n\nThe temple-like structure has been built around the hole, from which\nwater flows continuously.\n\n\nBehind the hole is a lillock.\n\n\nAccording to legend, Lord Vishnu killed the demon Lavanasura by\ninserting his toe in the  navel and whirling him\nround.\n\n\nThe goddess Ganga then emerged in the form of a spring to clean  toe.\n\n\nScientists believe that an asteoid striking the lillock generated\nsufficient pressure to force the stream of water", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c68e78cd-18ad-4ae7-a937-4ddbf47df1e9", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.002821+00:00"}
{"text": "Taxation Policies as an  Aid to Economic\n Development   \n\n\nJAL E. DASTUR  *   \n\n\n \n\n  THE   least that can be said is\nthat we are today living in interesting times.\n\n\nIt would not be untrue, or even an exaggeration, to say that no\nother period of 12 months in the whole history of our planet has seen such\nincredible changes as have taken place in the last 12 months.\n\n\nThe Berlin Wall has been broken; the two Germanies have been united.\n\n\nCommunism has been disowned not only in the countries of Eastern\nEurope, which were euphemistically known as the socialist bloc, but in its\nvery heartland,  the birth place of Lenin and Stalin,\nthe Soviet Union itself.\n\n\nThoughts which would hitherto have been considered blasphemous, such\nas a free market economy, are now being openly, unabashedly and forcefully\nexpressed and elaborate programmes chalked out for their speedy\nattainment. \n\n \n\nAs if to show that this is not just a European phenomenon, China,\nthe <*> line</*> sleeping giant of Asia, hitherto a great bastion of\nCommunism, is not immune to the winds of change though, not progressing\ntowards liberalisation at as fast a pace.\n\n\nNot only windows, but doors are being opened for economic\nparticipation to people and systems which till recently were anathema to the\nruling clique. \n\n \n\nNo less remarkable have been the events in South Africa.\n\n\nThough it is too soon to say that Apartheid has been dismantled or\ndisbanded, it is certainly much less rigid than it has ever been during the\nlast 40 years since it was so blatantly and brazenly proclaimed as an\narticle of faith by the late unlamented Dr. Daniel Malan. \n\n\n  Socialism in Flight  \n\n \n\nA question may be asked as to what the above exposition of\npolitics and recent history has got to do with this paper, which is on a\nfiscal-cum-economic subject.\n\n\nThe answer is that, except for the developments in South Africa, all\nthe other apparently political developments have, in fact, an economic\nmain spring.\n\n\nIf the East Germans wanted to be united ( I shall not use the word\n \" merged\"  for fear of wounding the sensitive East German\nego!), with their West German counterparts, it was not political freedom\nalone on the other side of the WaIl, which lured them.\n\n\nMore than anything else, it was the  economic\ndevelopment and industrial advancement, which acted as the magnetic pull.\n\n\nSimilarly, if the other European socialist nations, like\nCzechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania and Poland decided to change the basic\nstructure of their lives, it was in order to improve their economic  lot.\n\n\nPerhaps, there is a lesson in all this, which we in this part of the\nworld can ignore only at our peril. \n\n \n\nThe historical message, therefore, is loud and clear.\n\n\nSocialism is on the run.\n\n\nIt was given a fair chance.\n\n\nIn the USSR, it ran for over 70 years, more than the full length of\nthe biblical life span of man !\n\n\nIn the East European socialist countries, the innings, though\nundoubtedly shorter, still covered four to five decades.\n\n\nAt the end of it all, the preaching and practising high priests of\nsocialism have realised that the system did not \nreally deliver the goods.\n\n\nThe phrase, which has been just employed, is not metaphorical,\nbecause  \" goods\"  , after all, is the name of the development\ngame !\n\n\nMany years ago, Koestler achieved fame for himself by writing a\nbest-seller called  \" The God that Failed\"  .\n\n\nThe God, of course, was communism, though the allusion, to\nDivinity, is more than a little ironic, since communism is essentially\natheistic!\n\n\nHowever, be that as it may, history has borne out his prophecy. \n\n \n\nIn a way, the failure of socialism, is a failure of the knowledge\nof human psychology.\n\n\nMan is basically acquisitive and avaricious in his outlook.\n\n\nHe would work best, when he can reap the fruits of his own toil.\n\n\nHe would work for money, he would work for honour, he would probably\nwork for love but he would not work for the State, beyond a certain point.\n\n\n \n\nProbably sensing the message of the times and recognising the\nuniversal withdrawal from socialism, a known socialist, who presented the\nlast budget in my country, was constrained to make the apologetic and\ndefensive observation that he was not a doctrinaire socialist!  \n\n \n\nThe reader might wonder what point I am trying to derive or drive\nhome from the above narrative and, therefore, it is my duty to satiate his\ncuriosity.\n\n\nThe difference between socialism and capitalism, though fundamental,\nis really quite narrow.\n\n\nThe former lays stress on the distributive aspect and the latter\non the productive one.\n\n\nThe former is obsessed with distributing the existing cake\nequally, while the latter is absorbed in increasing the size of that cake\nso that all may get more, even if it is not necessarily equally.\n\n\nAs a result of the inexorable working of economic forces, the bigger\ncake would also lead to more egalitarian distribution.  \n\n\n  Poverty - - the No. 1 Foe  \n\n \n\nSince the beginning of human life, the arch enemy of mankind has\nnot been any particular individual or idea or system but a condition which\ngoes by the name  \" poverty\"  .\n\n\nThis is not something peculiar to my country or to this part of Asia.\n\n\nIt is a universal phenomenon present in the industrialised and\ndeveloped world alike, though, no doubt, to a much lesser extent in the\nformer.\n\n\nThe first step in military strategy is to recognise the foe.\n\n\nHaving identified poverty this way, we can say that we have\nnegotiated this first step. \n\n \n\nHaving identified the enemy, the next step is, of course,\nvanquishing him.\n\n\nThe only way, that I know by which this can be done is by the\ncreation of wealth.\n\n\nIt is said idiomatically that one must set a thief to catch a\nthief.\n\n\nHowever, this does not hold good here.\n\n\nJust as a dog does not eat another dog, one cannot vanquish poverty\nwith poverty.\n\n\nThe only thing which can vanquish poverty is its antonym, namely\nwealth.\n\n\nOne must, therefore, create as much of it as one can. \n\n\n  Prejudice Against Wealth  \n\n \n\nTime was when  \" profit\"  was considered a\ndirty word.\n\n\nToday, happily, it is looked upon more kindly.\n\n\nHowever, nature abhors a vacuum, and, accordingly, the word  \"\nwealth\"  to some minds, now occupies the vacated slot in the dirt\ndictionary as an unworthy concept, an economic pariah.\n\n\nHuman perception is often warped: straight thinking, therefore, is at\na discount.\n\n\nAs a result, almost a comical situation develops, wherein, even after\nhaving identified  enemy, instead of turning \nguns at him, one turns the guns at the very person who could suitably do\nbattle with the enemy.\n\n\nWe all agree that people must be raised above the poverty line.\n\n\nTo put it conversely, the poverty line must be lowered so that there\nare more people who out-surface it.\n\n\nIn other words our straggle, our endeavour, must be focussed\nundivertingly on the poverty line.\n\n\nDespite this, it is almost comic that just a few months ago, a high\npolitical dignitary in this part of the world talked albeit rather\ncasually about the affluence line, apparently hinting that a person should\nnot amass wealth beyond a particular point.\n\n\nThis, I think, is a pernicious thought.\n\n\nNational wealth is the sum total of individual wealth and, if our\ngoal is to increase national wealth, it can be achieved only by tolerating (\nif not  encouraging ) the components of inlividual\nwealth.\n\n\nIn the  view, therefore, nothing could be so\nselfdefeating as the project of delineating the so-called affluence\nline. \n\n \n\nTo recapitulate, our proclaimed enemy is poverty, and our best\nweapon against it, is the creation of wealth.\n\n\nWealth, again, can result only from economic development, both\nagricultural and industrial.\n\n\nTo state the most sterile truism, development requires resources - -\nmonetary, material and human.\n\n\nThe resources can be acquired only by human endeavour.\n\n\nNo doubt, there are many natural resources and happy is the land\nwhich possesses them in abundance.\n\n\nHowever, ultimately, it is human beings who exploit them.\n\n\nIt is, therefore, the human factor which must be nurtured.\n\n\nThis paper has already had occasion to cite two proverbs.\n\n\nA third one now comes to mind:  \" Money leads the mare.\"\n\n\n\nIt is, accordingly, monetary incentives, which appear to be the\nkey.\n\n\nTo invoke a fourth metaphor: it is the carrot, and not the stick,\nwhich must play the lead role. \n\n \n\nThe proposition that this paper is advancing is that the maximum\nmoney must be left in private individual  hands to\npromote development.\n\n\nIt is the well-known experience of mankind that private initiative\nis always more effective, more efficient and more enterprising than the\npublic one.\n\n\nWith a maximisation of private initiative, there would be a\nminimisation of corruption.\n\n\nCorruption breeds in an atmosphere of controls, and controls are,\nalmost by definition, inseparable from public regulation. \n\n \n\nTheoretically, it may appear that the ideal environment for\neconomic development would be a taxless society.\n\n\nSuch thought, however, apart from being impractical would also be\ndeceptive.\n\n\nIt would be impractical, because the State needs money for\ndefence, law-and-order; communications; diplomatic ties, etc.\n\n\nIt would be deceptive, because there can be no proper or, at least,\nspeedy economic development without the necessary infrastructure, which,\nin most cases, can be best provided by the State.\n\n\nFor this also, therefore, taxes would be required. \n\n \n\nIn fact, it must have been this realisation which prompted a\ngreat scientist-cum-politician of the l8th century to make the depressing\nprofound observation that nothing in this world can be said to be certain,\nexcept death and taxes!\n\n\nHaving reconciled ourselves, therefore, to the  inevitability of taxes, the problem is not only how to live with them\nbut also how to harness them to promote the noble cause of economic\ndevelopment, the pursuit of which is beyond controversy. \n\n\n  Savings - - Removal of Disincentive  \n\n \n\nThe object of economic development is beyond controversy, so\nalso the means through which it can be achieved.\n\n\nEconomic development requires investment and investment requires\nsavings.\n\n\nAlmost the first object of a taxation policy, therefore, should be\nto promote and encourage savings.\n\n\nA person who saves must be rewarded.\n\n\nInstead, we find today, that savings are subjected to a tax which\ngoes under the name wealth tax, because, wealth, after all is accumulated\nsavings.\n\n\nIt is a  income minus his expenditure.\n\n\nThese savings should qualify for a relief and not an additional\nimpost.\n\n\nThis may sound a revolutionary idea, if not utopian.\n\n\nThe touchstone, of all ideas, should be not their novelty or\ndeparture from tradition but their rationality and capacity to stand the\nruthless inquisition of logic. \n\n \n\nAs a matter of fact, wealth-tax  amounts to\ndouble taxation, because wealth is made up of that part, of income which has\nnot been spent.\n\n\nSince income itself would have been initially taxed, subjecting it\nagain to another tax ( albeit under a different label ) clearly amounts to a\nrepeat levy.\n\n\nThat the charging rates of wealth-tax, on the saved income are\nmuch lower than the rates at which tax was charged on the earned income, may\nmitigate the levy but does not excuse it. \n\n \n\nAgain, the income which has been spent away, is obviously beyond\nthe reach of the wealth-tax.\n\n\nThis means that the squanderer of income is at a premium in\ncomparison with the saver.\n\n\nThis goes against the basic proposition that saving holds the key to\ndevelopment. \n\n \n\nWealth-tax being conceptually a tax on savings, is unjustified.\n\n\nHowever, it is possible to make a resultoriented exception.\n\n\nThe case against wealth-tax rests on the assumption that the\nsavings, which are subjected to tax have been appropriately invested in a\ndevelopment-oriented manner.\n\n\nThus, savings, which are used to acquire fixed assets that\ndirectly contribute to production, must obviuosly be considered to be\ndevelopment-oriented.\n\n\nSimilarly, savings in the form of shares, debentures, bonds, bank\nand other deposits, which, though not directly contributing to production,\nserve that purpose indirectly ( by feeding those who contribute to\nproduction themselves, may be also considered to be development-oriented\n )  , thus qualifying for immunity from wealth-tax.\n\n\nHowever, the position would be different for savings transformed\ninto, say, bullion, jewellery, vacant land, unproductive vehicles, etc.\n\n\nThus, as far as such assets are concerned, they could probably be\nlegitimately subjected to this levy.\n\n\nNo doubt as already discussed above, this would still partake\nof the character of double taxation as the source of these assets would\nhave been income which has been subjected to income-tax.\n\n\nThis aberration, however, may be a necessary sacrifice to be\noffered at the altar of economic development.\n\n\nIn any event, avoidance of this double taxation would be in the  own hands - - because he could redeploy his assets into\ndevelopment channels.  \n\n \n\nThe above measure may not be really an incentive to savings, but\nonly a removal of an existing disincentive.\n\n\nIn other words, the tax on the savings ( which is what the\nwealth-tax is ) invested in productive and development-oriented assets\nshould be removed.  \n\n\n  Failure of Socialism is a failure of the knowledge of\nhuman psychology.    <&> tantalizer 2 on page 713, column\nthree  \n\n\n  Since the difficulty of saving increases with the\nquantum of saving, it seems logical that greater difficulty should be matched\nby greater incentive.   \n\n\n  Dividend should be allowed as a deduction to the\ndistributing company or it should be exempt in the hands of the recipient\nshareholders.   \n\n\n  Since the basic postulate of income-tax is the capacity\nto pay, there is no reason why it should not be levied on those who have this\ncapacity irrespective of whether they are in industry or farming. \n\n\n\n The paper presented by the author, a member of institute\nof Chartered Accountants of India, at the

{"text": "RULE OF LAW AND THE JUDICIAL PROCESS : SOME EMERGING\nCONCERNS  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nTHERE ARE several factors in modern democracies which constantly\nthreaten the civilised and civilising principle of Rule of Law.\n\n\nLack of legal certainty, decline in the effectiveness of the law and\ninequality in the legal processes tend to erode the supremacy of the law in\nvarying degrees.\n\n\nThese developments are at least in part due to the delay and\ndistortions in the judicial processes.\n\n\nThis article examines the responsibility of judges in the production\nof such distortions in Rule of Law in the course of the adjudicative\nfunctions. \n\n\n JUDICIARY AND THE UNCERTAINTY IN LAW \n\n \n\nA desire to do justice in a particular case is understandably\ncharacteristic of realist judges of all persuasions.\n\n\nBut in some cases, they may find the facts or the principle not\nsupportive of their compassion for the  cause.\n\n\nThe Common Law, with its penchant for precedents and for judicial\nrestraint, tends to create dilemmas in the mind of judges, particularly of\nthe higher courts, who have inherent power to do justice.\n\n\nWhen faced with such dilemma, different judges react and respond\ndifferently, more according to their conscience and social philosophy than\naccording to the settled principles of law.\n\n\nNeither position seems to be entirely right and Rule of Law would\ndemand a fine balancing between the pre-existing law and the compulsions to\ndo justice in particular cases. \n\n \n\nWhat happens in actual practice is that many cases tend to create\nuncertainty in law and eventual erosion of the Rule of Law principle.\n\n\nIt is not so much in civil and criminal cases that distortions to\nRule of Law become evident; it is in the adjudication of public law issues\nthat the malaise becomes apparent.\n\n\nThe recent spurt in public interest litigation in a variety of\nsituations, the  willingness to hear them relaxing procedural\nbottlenecks and to issue orders of all types did increase access to justice\nand  extracted accountability from the executive.\n\n\nHowever, in the process of doing so, the question of judicial\naccountability, particularly to Rule of Law and the scope of judicial\nfunction itself came in for lot of criticism and some ridicule.\n\n\nIs the debate motivated and ill-advised or is it justified and\ndesirable?\n\n\nThere is an argument that courts are grabbing jurisdiction and\nnarrowing the scope of legislative and executive action.\n\n\nWhile elected bodies are responsible for public policies, judicial\nlaw-making may be undemocratic,  ad hoc  and contrary to the\nconstitutional scheme.\n\n\nThe judicial defence that they are only interpreting the law and at\nbest only filling the gaps in the legal regime does not carry conviction,\nparticularly in parliamentary and executive circles. \n\n \n\nJudicial review is an acknowledged principle of consititutional\ngovernment.\n\n\nThe Indian judiciary has a proud record of upholding rule of law and\nenabling constitutional governance even during very difficult periods.\n\n\nThrough invoking epistolary jurisdiction and responding to the needs\nof access to justice for large masses of people, the Indian courts have\ndeveloped an illuminating branch of public law which deserves appreciation\nfrom all citizens.\n\n\nYet few lapses in this area by a few judges have justifiably let\ncredence to public outcry on issues of judicial accountability.\n\n\nIt is not clear whether it is the result of indivdual failures here\nand there or indications of structural distortions arising out of\nadministration of justice to a vast and complex country like India.\n\n\nThe expansion in numbers and the dilution of standards did contribute\nto the erosion in quality of administration of justice to some degree.\n\n\nEven though the distortions ae few and far between, its cost in terms\nof Rule of Law to a developing democracy, like India, is indeed great and\nsometimes very disturbing. \n\n \n\nTo illustrate the point, responsible citizens point out the way\nin which the Supreme Court has handled the medical college admissions and the\nreservation controversy.\n\n\nBoth are important issues affecting the social fabric in which\nlegislative action is what is ordinarily stipulated.\n\n\nOnce the court took cognisance of it, several issues cropped up, the\nresolution of which was largely within the executive and legislative spheres\nof government.\n\n\nOrders of the Court came to be selectively enforced and quietly\ndisregarded which confounded the confusion and unsettled issues raising\ndoubts on the principles and procedures of law.\n\n\nOf course, the courts alone are not responsible for the prevailing\nuncertainty and apprehensions about the scope of the law.\n\n\nThe urge to correct injustices has led the courts to unchartered\nspheres of governance in which judicial intervention was perhaps not\nadequately matched with judicial restraint and statesmanship. \n\n \n\nAnother grey area of uncertainty created by judicial process is\nin respect of compensatory remedies courts allowed for violation of certain\nfundamental rights.\n\n\nThe jurisprudence governing the remedy through constitutional courts\nis yet to be settled and insitutionalised.\n\n\nThe result has been  ad hoc  responses depending upon the\njudge rather than on principles of law.\n\n\nSimilarly, the sentencing law, as evolved through decisions of the\nhigher courts, has led to  some degree of\ndistortion in criminal justice administration.\n\n\nAgain, the state of judicially evolved norms of administrative law is\nin a state of continuing flux, leaving the civil services confused,\ncompromising efficiency and accountability in the administrative process.\n\n\nWhat is  ` State'  ; who is a  ` worker'\n ; what constitutes  ` industry'  ; what are the\n ` basic features'  of the Constitution; when would the\nimposition of death penalty become unconstitutional and similar concepts have\nbeen expanded and interpreted sometimes through conflicting opinions leaving\nthe field for endless litigation and continued uncertainty of the law.\n\n\nIf every situation is to be judicially tested in order to ascertain\nthe legal position, it does not portend well for good governance and for Rule\nof Law.\n\n\nAs one writer has put it,  \" <*> dotted line</*> The\nunintended consequences of pseudo-realist adjudication have introduced a new\nfactor of legal unpredictability into human affairs <*> dotted line</*>\n\n\nPseudo-realism introduces an incalculable retrospective effect\nbecause the courts are attempting to create new aims for society or to impose\non society new basic directives.\n\n\nQuite apart from any other misgivings one might have, this is\nobjectionable because of the limited participation in the decision by\nlitigants who: ( 1) generally represent only themselves, and ( 2) participate\nin the decision only by evidence and argument addressed to the deciding\nauthority\"  .  1 \n\n\n JUSTICE SHOULD BE SEEN TO HAVE BEEN DONE \n\n \n\nIt is trite to say that justice should not only be done, but\nshould be seen to have been done if respect for law and the judicial process\nis to be maintained.\n\n\nThis demonstrative effect of Rule of Law is the result of a number of\nfactors, each of which has come to be tainted by certain developments to\nwhich the judiciary is said to be responsible to a certain extent.\n\n\nSome of these factors may be summarised as follows: \n\n\n1.   Delay in Litigation:  \n\n \n\nThis has assumed scandalous proportions at least in certain areas\nof litigation.\n\n\nPendency of 20  lakh  cases in various courts is\nindeed an alarming situation.\n\n\nWhen it is realised that the figure would only increase in view of\nthe rate of filing of fresh cases each year and the continuance of outmoded\nmethods of judicial administration, there is reason to feel uncomfortable\nabout the future of the justice system itself.\n\n\nThere is no denying the fact that the degree of professional\ncompetence of judges and their commitment to the integrity of the system are\ncontributing factors to delay in administration of justice.\n\n\nOf course, one can legitimately explain causes of delay outside the\ncontrol of judges; but for the ordinary citizen, it is difficult to\nappreciate that justice can be  inordinately\ndelayed without the knowledge and connivance of the judges.\n\n\nIf judgements are not delivered in reasonable time after the hearing\nof the case is completed, judges alone are to be accountable for it.\n\n\nIf punctuality is not followed and court time is wasted, again, the\nlitigant public locate the fault on the judges only.\n\n\nComparative statistics of different courts indicate that judges with\na little more effort can be much more productive than what they are today\ndespite the inhospitable environment and poor support systems they presently\nhave. \n\n\n2.   Impartiality in Justicing:  \n\n \n\nA number of principles of judicial propriety have been\nincorporated in the system through unwritten laws and conventions to carry\nconviction of impartiality among the litigant public.\n\n\nThey are matters of self-discipline which judges are supposed to\nfollow without external sanctions.\n\n\nIf people were to litigate against judges for having allowed their\nkith and kin to practise before the same court, it would be naturally\ninterpreted as indifference to principles of accountability.\n\n\nTo say that the impropriety is restricted only to appearance before\nthem and not before their other colleagues in different benches of the same\ncourt may be technically right but in actual practice lacks credibility.\n\n\nThe image of impartiality cannot be taken for granted and has to be\nmeticulously built up by each and every judicial officer throughout his\ncareer. \n\n\n3.   Politicisation of Judicial Appointments:  \n\n \n\nIt required at least two major public interest litigations and\nover several years of public debate, before the procedure for appointment of\njudges to the higher courts could be saved from unhealthy influences of party\npolitics and executives interference.\n\n\nFor judicial accountability, it is necessary that in matters of\nappointments and transfers, the apex court should have a decisive say.\n\n\nInsulating judiciary from political influences not only helps in\njudicial independence but also gives the right message of impartiality in a\nsituation where the government itself is the largest litigant. \n\n\n ROLE OF LAWYERS AND JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY \n\n \n\nIn the final analysis, many of the ills of judiciary can be\ntraced to the doorsteps of the bar.\n\n\nThe judges are drawn from among lawyers and it is they who influence\njudicial process by their actions and omissions.\n\n\nThe bar and the bench are the two wheels of the chariot of justice\nand unless both the wheels work in cohesion, even-handed justice will not be\ndelivered.\n\n\nTherefore, whether its a question of delay in litigation, or an issue\nof impartiality in justicing or criticisation of the judicial process, the\nlegal profession plays a significant role which is often noticed little by\nthe public at large.\n\n\nIf there is higher degree of accountability in the legal profession,\nit is imperative that judicial accountability  will\nnaturally follow.\n\n\nMore than anyone else, the members of the bar know their judges and\nmonitor their actions within and outside the courts.\n\n\nJudges cannot ordinarily defend themselves against public criticisms\nwhereas lawyers can.\n\n\nAnd it is expected of the legal profession not to allow loose and\nirresponsible talk about the judiciary and to the independence of the\njudiciary at all times. \n\n \n\nUltimately, accountability is a matter of conscience of each\nindividual person.\n\n\nA trained judge, when he assumes the divine role of dispensing\njustice, is presumed to have sacrificed certain material pleasure open to an\nordinary citizen in return for the independent, exalted and noble function of\njusticing on behalf of the State.\n\n\nThat is why certain privileges and immunities are provided to the\njudge and the power to punish contempt is conferred on him.\n\n\nIf he cannot prevail over small temptations and succumb easily to\nhuman frailities, he is unfit to be a judge and the people should have power\nto recall such a person.\n\n\nHowever, the power to recall has to be so structured that it does not\nact to the detriment of impartiality and fairness implicit in judicial\nfunctioning.\n\n\nTo avoid the extreme step of removal from office, it is incumbent on\nthe part of every judge to conscientiously and scrupulously follow the norms\nof propriety and of judicial ethics.\n\n\nLet every judge remember the truism that justice should not only be\ndone but seen to have been done.\n\n\nLet the advocates take a vow that they will not talk or do anything\nin private or in public which has a tendency to belittle the judiciary and\nexpose the judges to unjustified public criticism and ridicule.\n\n\nAs the lawyers manage the profession through peer group justice, let\nthe judges put their house in order by the supervision, authority and\ncharacter of senior judges, of course extreme cases of judicial corruption\nwill invite the consequences under the ordinary law of the land and no\nsection of the profession will seek to protect such black sheep on extraneous\nconsiderations.\n\n\nBecause of few stray incidents of judicial improprieties noticed in\nthe recent past, the whole judiciary should not be condemned and it is all\nthe more reprehensible if lawyers themselves do so.\n\n\nOn balance, the Indian judiciary has a proud record of service and\nintegrity which is appreciated the world over.\n\n\nNo attempt should be made to tarnish this image, assiduously built up\nover the years by generations of upright judges whose continued presence in\nlarge numbers even today is the best guarantee of democracy and Rule of Law\nin an otherwise grim situation. \n\n \n\nThis is not to argue that aberrations are to be ignored or issues\nof judicial accountability not discussed in public forums.\n\n\nIn a democratic society like ours, no insititution is above public\nscrutiny. \n\n \n\nIt is the right and privilege of the legal profession, in\nparticular to judge the judges, provided they do so with restraint, with full\nfacts and with full responsibility for the consequences.\n\n\nIt is unfortunate that there is a tendency in some sections of the\nbar ro disregard these wise principles of prudence and professionalism in\nassessing judicial performance.\n\n\nHence, the need for caution and circumspection.\n\n\nThere is need to collectively build institutional  mechanisms and healthy conventions to prevent judiciary being\npoliticised or influenced by non-judicial considerations.\n\n\nThere is equally a need to isolate individuals unworthy of judicial\noffice and proceed against them according to the due process of law.\n\n\nAt the same time, all democratic forces must endeavour to prevent\ndestructive forces, making a mountain out of a mole hill and disparaging the\njudiciary as a whole without realising the consequences to an institution\nwhich more than any others preserved and promoted constitutional government\nand Rule of Law in the country.

Mr\nWatson'.  \n\n \n\nI have been fairly busy; especially compared with\nthe lifestyle  \nof College of Airwarfare at Secundarabad. \n\n\nTill end of July it was hectic, as I had to cope with\nthe quantum of  \nwork. \n\n\nAnyway, I do find time to enjoy myself and watch TV\nonce in a way.  \n\n \n\nThis post has taught me how to handle multifarious\njobs and also how to deal with stress. \n\n\nI have realised that it is not possible or rather it\nis  \ncounterproductive to believe perfection  in\nfields that do  \nnot  merit perfection. Also\nto put it in a  \n language, it is better to work at 95 % RPM\n (  \nRevolutions per Minute of the engine ) than to work at full\nthrostle and burn oneself out in the bargain. \n\n\nYou wont believe this - - I even tried  to learn  \nclassical singing from a local music teacher, as a form of\nrelaxation. \n\n\n Typical of me, I didn't pursue becasue\nI  told  him to get on to\n Malkauns  ( my  \nfavourite ) at the earliest and I could see he was most\nreluctant to do so. \n\n\nAll in all, I do believe life is a continuous process\nof learning and  \nI do hope you will notice some change in my attitudes next\ntime we meet.  \n\n \n\nI just read what I wrote to check back if I was\nmaking any sense  \nor simply rambling along and confusing you with my convoluted\nsentences. \n\n\nIt seems OK except that I wonder why my typical\nScorpio trait of  \nkeeping my thoughts to myself doesn't work out while writing\nto you. \n\n\nSome chemistry I suppose!  \n\n \n\nI was glad to read that you are able to walk\naround and also  \nmanaged the Bombay trip without any problems. \n\n\nI wonder if you would care to visit us ( health\npermitting ) at Kalaikenda. \n\n\nNothing would please me more than having you and\n Mami  with us for a month or so. \n\n\nDo write if that is possible.  \n\n \n\nSamar has stabilised at the Doon School and the\nyounger one at the Airforce School.  \n\n \n\nI once again invite you to our place and genuinely\nfeel that a  \nchange of place and environment would brighten up the\notherwise monotonous  \nand routine life we all have to  live.  \n\n\nRegards to  mami  and love to all the\nrest. \n \n\n\nAffly yours Sd/-  \n\n  \n\n\n Fujariah  29 / 08 / 98. \n \n\n\nDear Appa, \n\n \n\nYou are not aware of the extent of tension I was\nunder when I was in Bombay for that one day. \n\n\nI did not have a single original  \n documents  \n  with me at that very moment which were so badly\nrequired for joining the ship. \n\n\nBut as it happened that they were also equally  ( badly) in need of my joining so somehow they\nmanaged to put me on to the ship. \n\n\nMy original Panamian documents were lost in the post (\nor rather  \ndelayed) which I had posted to them from UK. \n\n\nFortunately they wre delivered safely after 25 days (\nSWIFT-MAIL! )  \nbut it was too late. \n\n\nThat is why they asked for my photographs at the\n11th hour. \n\n\nSecondly I had applied for \" Dangerous goods\n\"  \nendorsement in UK on my UK liscence which also took some time\nto process. \n\n\nRajashree received them only last week. \n\n\nThings are looking up it seems now. \n\n\nMy written exams results are expected anytime next\nweek & Rajashree  \nis frantically trying to join me tomorrow. \n\n\nLet us see what happens.  \n\n \n\n also upset & dishartened over your\ndecision over  \nshifting to Kolhapur once again. \n\n\nYou know, somehow I feel a sense of security when you\nare there nearby. \n\n\nThat is why I insisted that you shift to Pune\nalongwith us. \n\n\nI still need you. \n\n\nThen, when I look at your side & think, I feel you are\nbetter off in  \nKolhapur in the sense, you have all the infrastructure set up\nfor your  \nproject there, your assistant & Mr. Gosavi are all there to\nhelp you complete your peoject. \n\n\n Amma  too feels  at home \nwhen she is in Kolhapur. \n\n\n how I convince myself over your\ndecision. \n\n\nI will look forward to the day when you shall return\nto Pune & I will  \ngive you all the luxuries &  look after\nyour needs &  \nnever ever give you a chance to complain again.  \n\n \n\n  coming back home in\nJan / Feb ' 99 \n\n\nMeanwhile  sending you a cheque of Rs.\n20,000/-. \n\n\nYou can use it whenever necessary or you may save it. \n\n\nBut  decided that I will keep sending you\nsome money  \nregularly. \n\n\n very poor at managing money ( That is\nwhat   \nrealised ) & am not able to save enough \n\n\nBut whenever I earn,  going to send you a\npart of it. \n\n\n sent Sept allotment to my bank which is\nexpected to be  \ncredited in my Account in the 2nd week of Sept. \n\n\nHope you should get this letter by the same time. \n\n \n\nNothing more to pen. \n\n\n write to you from Japan again.  \n\n\nKeep in touch & do write to me. \n \n\n\nYours loving son Sd/-  \n\n  \n\n\n14th Oct ' 98 Rastanura ( Saudi Arabia ) \n \n\n\nDear Appa, \n\n \n\nTrust this letter finds you & Amma in a festive\nmood.  \n\n \n\n back at Rastanura in Saudi Arabia\nfor loading of  \nliquified petroleum gas & shall sail back to Japan for\ndischarging of cargo (  \nLPG). \n\n\nThis place - - Rastanura is in close proximity to\nDubai,  \napproximately 3 hrs drive to the downtown, so repatriation\nbecomes  \nconvenient. \n\n\nAs we normally don't berth here; I had to board the\nship in the mid  \nsea on the 1st of sept.  \n\n \n\nMy flight from Bombay to Dubai  en route\n  \nMuscut was quite comfortable. \n\n\nI was issued business class ticket right upto Dubai. \n\n\nWe managed to get a window seat very close to the\ncockpit. \n\n\nKuku could see Aeroplanes   \ntaxiing    \non the runway & was excited about it. \n\n\nOn arrival at Dubai airport I called up     sister-in-law   - - Roli, only\nhoping that her  \ntelephone no. hadn't changed as I couldn't     \npre-intimate   her. \n\n\nLike Deepa, she too is an Engineering graduate,   \nworking with Compaq computers & her husband Anurag Saxena is a\nbig shot in  \nDubai with an  MBA degree, to his credit. \n\n\nI was    overwhelmed \n with their  \nhospitality & jovial, down-to-earth nature. \n\n\nDespite    his   busy\nschedules he took  \na day off at his office & drove me around almost everywhere. \n\n\nThey also showed me the spots where Zee TV serial\n  `  \nDASTAAN'   was shot. \n\n\nExcept for the soaring temperature, Dubai is indeed\nan amazing place  \nespecially the shopping malls & amusement parks. \n\n\nWe also visited some  authentic\n South Indian Restaurants. \n\n\nWhere I packed  Idli, Chutney & sambhar\n from Kamat  \nfor Raju before boarding the ship!  \n\n \n\nI was really in need of a change of place so on\nan impulse I  \ncomplied with the  request of me flying\nalong with Kuku on  \nsuch a short notice. \n\n\nMoreover I was longing to stay with Raju as well. \n\n\nAnyway it turned out to be a good decision.  \n\n \n\n very sad to know that your prostate\npain hasn't  \nsubsided as yet. \n\n\nHope it doesn't hamper your project work. \n\n\nAnyway don't overexert yourself. \n\n\nI guess you must have already consulted Dr. Punjoni.\n \n\n \n\n work has eased out a bit. \n\n\nLast month he was working for almost 15 hrs a day!\nowing to a  \ntechnical snag in Engine followed by 40   \ntonnes   \n of fuel oil spillage on the deck during bunkering. \n\n\nA Norwegian Inspector was a witness to this\ncatastrophe; he was  \nsailing with us upto Japan. \n\n\nHe held Chief Engg & 4th Engg responsible\nfor it & both  \nwere sacked. \n\n\nNow that everything is back to normal, Raju is\nrelaxed & carrying  \nout with his routine work. \n\n\nInvariably I & Kuku are with him in the Engine\nControl Room. \n\n\nKuku has become an expert seafarer. \n\n\nHe does his homework regularly; I don't have to\npester him to open  \nhis hooks. \n\n\nAs far as his food is concerned,  not\nfussy about  \nanything. \n\n\n( His diet comprises of milk, eggs, fruits & bread )\n. \n\n\nHowever I feel he misses  chappattis \n&  `  \nbhaji'  . \n\n\nOf course he misses you both    a\nlot    \nespecially when he is studying he remembers his  `\nAjja' .  \n\n \n\nWe both were shocked to know about the sad demise\nof   \nsou.

- thanks to good monsoons - - but it is not significant enough to\npush the economy to a higher level of growth, largely because of decline in\ngrowth that has set in the industrial sector.\n\n\nThe good performance of agriculture has been largely offset by the\nsetback in the industrial sector especially in 1990-91. \n\n \n\nThe composite index of six infrastructure industries e.g. power,\npetroleum, crude, refinery products, saleable steel, coal and cement,\nrecorded a  \" sharp deceleration\"  in the growth rate to\n3.5 % in the current year as compared to 6.5 % in the comparable period of\nthe preceding year.\n\n\nWhile output in absolute terms may have increased, it has fallen\nshort of the targets set.\n\n\nThe RBI report has attributed the rise in growth rates both in the\ngeneral index of industrial production and in the manufacturing sector in the\nfirst seven months to the low base of the comparable period of the previous\nyear. \n\n \n\nThe  \" depressing performance\"  of the\ninfrastructure industries as well as the lower availability of imported raw\nmaterials and components consequent on the balance of payments crisis will\nhave an adverse impact on the overall industrial production in the current\nyear.\n\n\nThe anticipated growth rate of industrial output at around 6 to 7\npercent in the current year as compared to 8.6 percent in 1989-90 reflects a\nsignificant downturn and thus the overall performance of the economy is a\nmixed one. \n\n \n\nWhile the agricultural sector scenario is encouraging, with the\nexceptionally good South-West monsoon in 1990, leading to a record Kharif\nfoodgrain output of about 102 million tonnes, as against the target of 95\nmillion tonnes, prospects for 1991-92 would depend as much on favourable\nweather as on better management of supply of inputs and remunerative prices.\n\n\nThe prospects for commercial crops, with the exception of groundnut,\nhave also been satisfactory.\n\n\nBut the country needs to do more to increase oilseeds production to\nreduce the drain on foreign exchange through imports of edible oils and to\nlower the domestic prices of this essential commodity. \n\n \n\nThe stagnation in industrial sector is accompanied by high prices\nwhich do not induce producers to improve the supplies of goods and services.\n\n\nFrom all directions there is indication of possible worsening of the\nprice situation.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the trade gap is widening and net inflows of foreign\ncurrency deposits are declining.\n\n\nWith the continuing decline in foreign exchange reserves, essential\nimports to keep the wheels of industry moving are difficult to provide for.\n\n\n \n\nThe rate of inflation as measured by the wholesale price index is\nlikely to touch 13 percent by the end of the year ( March, 1991 ) .\n\n\nOne way to control inflation would be by mopping up excess liquidity\nin the economy through fiscal measures and by controlling non-productive\nexpenditure.\n\n\nResources invested on creating productive assets must start giving\nreturns by accelerating the production process.\n\n\nThe infrastructure industries should be given special attention so\nthat industrial growth is enabled to regain its lost momentum. \n\n \n\nIn overcoming the current stagnation and in controlling\ninflation hard decisions are called for.\n\n\nThere will have to be incentives to produce more and export more and\nfor achieving this objective, resources will have to be directed to\nproductive purposes.\n\n\nAll this cannot be done through budgetary measures alone.\n\n\nSome clearcut policy initiatives will be necessary, though in\nsiphoning off excess liquidity fiscal and monetary policies will come handy.\n\n\n \n\nNow that a full-fledged budget is no to be presented and instead\na vote on account will be taken, a period of uncertainty is ahead and the\ntasks of fiscal correction and launching of the Eighth Plan with a clear\ndemarcation of the roles of the public and the private sectors have taken\na back seat, at any rate for the present. \n\n \n\n\n  Method of Accounting  Under Companies\nAct, 1956  and Income-Tax Act, 1961   \n\n\nP.S. JOSHI  *  <*> line from left to right</*>  <*> line from left to\nright</*>  \n\n \n\n  THE   amendment to Section 209\nof the  Companies Act, 1956  requires the companies to follow\naccrual basis and double entry system of accounting.\n\n\nSection 209 ( 3 ) further states that proper books of account shall\nnot be deemed to have been kept if such books are not on accrual basis and\naccording to double entry system of accounting. \n\n \n\nCompanies had different accounting years and the  \"\nprevious year\"  under the Income-tax Act for the purpose of taxation\nwhich was decided in accordance with Section 3 as it stood prior to\namendments brought by the  Direct Tax Laws ( Amendment ) Act, 1987. \n\n\n \n\nThe amendment to Section 3 has brought in the concept of uniform\naccounting year for the purpose of income-tax assessment.\n\n\n The  section  inter alia  provides that with\neffect from 1st April 1989  \" previous year\"  for the purpose\nof the Act means the financial year immediately preceding the assessment\nyear.\n\n\nIn order to comply with the uniform accounting year under the\nIncome-tax Act, many companies have changed their accounting year and\nclose their books of accounts on 31st March.\n\n\nHowever, there is no amendment to Companies Act requiring\ncompanies to adopt the accounting year from April to March and, therefore,\nquite a few companies have continued to \nfollow an accounting period different from financial year. \n\n\n  Method of Accounting  \n\n \n\nIn the past, companies have been following cash or hybrid or\nmercantile system of accounting, but it has now become incumbent upon them\nto switch over to accrual basis following the amendment to Section 209 ( 3 ) .\n\n\n \n\nThe accrual system of accounting has been defined in para 1.06\nof the ICAI guidance note of 1983 on Terms used in Financial Statements.\n\n\nAs an accounting concept, accrual \nbasis is not different from mercantile basis. \n\n \n\nIn accordance with Section 145 of  Income-tax Act, 1961,\n the income chargeable under the head  \" profits and gains of\nbusiness or profession\"  or  \" Income from other sources\"\n shall be computed in accordance with the method of accounting\nregularly employed by the assessee.\n\n\nIt is an accepted position that an assessee can adopt either\nmercantile system or cash system  [ ( CIT. vs Chunilal vs Mehta & Sons P.\nLtd 82 ITR 55 ( SC ) ] . \n\n\nAn assessee can also follow hybrid / heterogeneous system besides\ncash / mercantile system according to Supreme Court decision in the matter\nof  CIT vs Krishnaswami Mudliar, 53 ITR 122. \n\n\nIt is also to be noted that the applicability of Section 145 of\nIncome-tax Act is in respect of all the assessees.\n\n\nThis means that non-company assessees can continue to follow cash\nor hybrid system. \n\n \n\nIt is also necessary to examine the requirement of tax audit\nunder Section 44 AB.\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 44 AB,  \" Every person ( a)\ncarrying on business shall, if his total sales, turnover, gross receipt, as\nthe case may be, in business exceed Rs. 40  lakh  in any\nprevious year; or ( b) carrying on profession shall, if his gross receipts in\nprofession exceed Rs. 10  lakh  in any previous year,\nget his accounts of such previous year audited by an accountant before the\nspecified date and obtain before that date the report of such audit in the\nprescribed form duly signed and verified by such accountant and setting\nforth such particulars as may be prescribed; provided that in a case where\nsuch person is required by or under any other law to get his accounts\naudited, it shall be sufficient compliance with the provisions of this\nsection if such person gets the accounts of such business  audited by an accountant before the specified date and obtain before\nthat date the report of the audit as required under such other law and a\nfurther report in the form prescribed under this section.\" \n\n\n \n\nThe proviso applies to all assessees who are required to get\ntheir accounts audited under any law, and hence it is applicable to\ncompanies also. \n\n \n\nIn respect of companies having  an\naccounting year other than financial year, say, 31st December, a question\narises as to whether under Section 44 AB of the Income-tax Act the tax\nauditor can audit and certify the accounts for the period for which accounts\nhave been maintained under the Companies Act ( i.e. upto 31st December ) or\nwhether the tax auditor will have to certify the accounts for the relevant\nfinancial year which is the uniform accounting year for tax purposes. \n\n \n\nThis matter was referred to \" CBDT \" , which\nvide their circular\n\n\n561 dated 22nd May, 1990 has pointed out that as the income of\nprevious year is chargeable to tax and for the purpose of Income-tax Act, the\nprevious year is financial year, the tax auditor would have to carry out\nthe audit under Section 44 AB in respect of the period covered by the\nprevious year i.e. the relevant financial year.\n\n\nThe Board further clarified that the provision of Section 44 AB\ncovers only the cases where the accounts are audited under any other\nlaw in respect of financial year.\n\n\nThe circular further states that where the accounting year is\ndifferent from the financial year, the provisions of Section 44 AB will not\napply.\n\n\nIn such cases, where the  accounting year is\ndifferent from financial year, the tax auditor would have to carry out the\ntax audit in respect of the period covered by the relevant financial year and\nsubmit his report in form 3 CB as required by rule 6G ( 1) ( b) of the\nIncome-tax Rules. \n\n \n\nThe \" CBDT \" circular established a fact that\nthe tax audit under Section 44 AB is not necessarily linked with the\nstatutory audit under the Companies Act, and therefore, a tax auditor has\nto carry out tax audit separately. \n\n \n\nThe Board has, however, not considered the possibility where a\ncompany which has been maintaining the accounts on cash or hybrid system\nand has an accounting year same as  \" previous year\"  ,\nprepares two sets of final accounts - - one under cash or hybrid system (\nfor income-tax ) and the other on accrual basis ( as required under\nCompanies Act ) , in the cases where Section 44 AB is applicable and the\ncases in which Section 44 AB is not applicable. \n\n \n\nHowever, it can be concluded that the company would be within its\nrights ( subject to provisions of Section 145 of Income-tax Act ) to\ncontinue to maintain the accounts for the purpose of Income-tax Act, under\ncash or hybrid system and prepare its accounts for the purpose of Companies\nAct on accrual basis as required by Section 209 ( 3) of Companies Act.\n\n\n \n\nWhere a company having financial year as accounting year and\nprepares two sets of accounts, it is necessary to examine whether the\nIncome-tax department would reject the accounts prepared undercash /\nhybrid system, just because the income returned works out to be lower than\nthe income which would have been worked out on accrual basis.\n\n\nIn case the company had been regularly following cash or hybrid\nsystem for the earlier assessment years, the department cannot reject the\ncash / hybrid only on the grounds that a separate set of accounts has been\nprepared on accrual basis as required under Companies Act. \n\n \n\nThe power to reject the method of accounting has been split out\nin the proviso to Section 145 ( 10 of Income-tax Act ) which is as under:\n Provided  that in any case where the accounts are correct and\ncomplete to the satisfaction of the assessing officer but the method\nemployed is such that, in the opinion of the assessing officer the income\ncannot be properly deduced therefrom, then the computation shall be made\nupon such basis and in such manner as the assessing officer may determine.\n\n\n \n\nIn order to reject the method of accounting, it is necessary for\nthe assessing officer to establish that the income cannot be properly deduced\nfrom the method of accounting followed by the assessee.\n\n\nIn case a company prepares two sets of accounts, a reconciliation\nbetween the Profit & Loss Account under cash system and the Profit & Loss\naccount under the mercantile system, can be prepared in order to establish\nthat the income derived under the cash system is correct. \n\n \n\nThe Andhra Pradesh High Court has held in  CIT vs Margadarsi\nChit Funds P. Ltd., 19 ( Taxman 73 )  that when the assessee has\nfollowed a particular method of accounting and has been regularly following\nit, the department must have sufficient material for rejecting the method of\naccounting.\n\n\nThe learned judge has said that the choice to account for income on\nan acceptable basis is that of the assessee and not of the department.\n\n\nThe  power to substitute a system of accounting for the\none followed by the assessee, flows from provisions of Section 145 of the\nIncome-tax Act.\n\n\nIt is, therefore, imperative that before rejecting the system of\naccounting followed by the assessee, the ITO must refer to the inherent\ndefect in the system and record a clear finding that the true pofit / loss\ncannot be deduced from the books of account maintained by the assessee.\n\n\nAs already observed, there is no finding to that effect in this case.\n\n\nThe  view that there could be a better system of\naccounting is no reason for application of the provision of Section 145 of\nthe Act, especially in view of the fact that this system of accounting is\nfollowed by the assessee uniformly and regularly for the past several years\nand was accepted by the department without objection. \n\n\n  Change in Method of Accounting  \n\n \n\nThe insistence on the method to be followed on regular basis does\nnot debar the assessees from changing the method of accounting.\n\n\nThe assessee is entitled to change the method of accounting, but such\nchange should arise out of commer-      cial expediency and also should be a  \nbona fide   one.\n\n\nThe change in accounting system should not be a casual departure.\n\n\n \n\nIn  \" Padamsee Mulji Ginning & Pressing Co. ( P)\nLtd., 3 ITD 92 ( Bom ) , \"  the assessee, a holding company,\nhad advanced loans to its subsidiary companies and interest chargeable on\nsuch loans was regularly being returned by it as its income on accrual basis.\n\n\nLater on the company resolved that interest receivable would be\naccounted on cash basis, as the subsidiary companies are in financial\ndifficulties and, therefore, it did not return any income from this source.\n\n\nThe tribunal held, that so long as there was no   mala\nfide   motives in changing the method, the assessee could not\nbe denied the privilege of changing the method of accounting. \n\n \n\nIn the case of  \" Rajiv Investment ( P) Ltd. vs lTO,\n20 ITD 431 ( Cal ) \"  it was held that if one regular method of\naccounting was changed to another method of accounting and followed it\nthereafter regularly, the department has to accept such change. \n\n \n\nIt may be noted that the change in the method of accounting\nshould be on account of commercial expediency.\n\n\nIn the case of  \" Deepnarin Nagu & Co I ITD 288 ( Indore )\n, \"  the assessee, after filing the original return of income\nduly supported by valid accounts, decided to switch over from mercantile to\ncash system of accounting and filed revised return of income supported by\nrevised sets of accounts.\n\n\nThe ITO and AAC declined to accept the revised return, holding\nthat the change in the system of accounting being not on account of\ncommercial expediency but was only an afterthought.\n\n\nThe Tribunal confirmed the view, holding that the assessee has\nnot proved that the change was   bona fide   .\n\n\n \n\nThe companies which plan to maintain accounts for income-tax\npurpose as per cash or hybrid system and mercantile basis for Companies Act,\nas against mercantile basis earlier followed for income-tax as well as\nCompanies Act, should ensure that sufficient evidence is placed on record to\nprove that the change is necessitated by commercial expediency. \n\n \n\nIt can therefore be concluded that companies, irrespective of the\naccounting year followed by them for the purpose of  \"\nCompanies Act, 1956, \"  can continue to submit the accounts for\nthe  \" previous year\"  for the purpose of income-tax\nassessments, if the company had been uniformly and regularly following the\nsaid system in the past.  \n\n\n \n\n\nWhen the assessee has followed a particular method of accounting and\nhas been regularly following it, the Income-tax Department must have\nsufficient material for rejecting the method of accounting.  \n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe insistence on the method to be followed on regular basis, does\nnot debar the assessees from changing the method of accounting.  \n\n\n  The author is a\nmember of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8135c31f-133a-47ff-a24a-56f34e8b5f1c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.009087+00:00"}
{"text": "CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC STATE OF INDIA : A CRITIQUE \n\n\n \n\n \n\nFORMAL, LEGAL and institutional arrangements for the governance of\nIndia have been laid down in great details by the Constitution of India.\n\n\nThe philosophy and legality underlying the Constitution establishes a\ndemocratic, federal, secular and welfare State in India.\n\n\nCarl J. Friedrich, in his classic  Constitutional Government and\nDemocracy  , observes:\n\n\nConstitutionalism by dividing power provides a system of effective\nrestraints upon governmental action.\n\n\nFor studying it, one has to explore the methods and techniques by\nwhich such restraints are established and maintained.\n\n\nPutting it in another, more familiar, but less exact way, it is a\nbody of rules ensuring fairplay, thus rendering the government  `\nresponsible'   1  .  CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC STATE\n\n \n\nThe constitutional democratic State of India is the best example\nof  picture of consitutionalism.\n\n\nThe Indian Constitution has provided for complex web of checks and\nbalances to ensure  ` accountability'  and  `\nresponsibility'  of every public institution and public functionary.\n\n\nParliamentary democratic State ensures accountability of the\npolitical executive and competitive politics and periodical elections, on the\nbasis of universal adult franchise, are meant to ensure  popular \ncontrol over the political executive.\n\n\nThe political executive is dependent on the verdict of the voters and\nit has to abide by the decisions of the independent Supreme Court which is\nthe  Guarantor  of the Constitution and the Rule of Law.    Modern State \n\n R. M. MacIver, in his classic,  The Modern State  , observes\nthat  \" Representative government distinguishes the modern State from\nall other\"  .  2  \n\n \n\nThe Indian Constitution makers established a  ` modern\nState'  by evolving a scheme of representative government at the\nCentre, the State and the local levels in a federal country and  essential principle, like  , is fully contained in\nthe Indian Constitution. \n\n \n\nFurther, modern Marxist and Liberal Democratic Theories demand a\nfew new things from the modern States at the close of the Twentieth Century.\n\n\nThe Liberal Theorists evaluate a Constitutional Democratic State on\nthe basis of the effectiveness of the institutions of the State to protect\nand promote  individual rights and justice  .\n\n\nThe State is a means to an end.\n\n\nThe development of a liberated individual is the goal of all social\ninstitutions, including the State and autonomous civil society is an\nessential condition for promotion of individual personality and\npotentialities.\n\n\nEdward Shils elaborates on this theme of homogenisation of the\nindividual and local communities by the power of the Centre which is a threat\nto the peripheries.\n\n\nShils observes: \n\n \n\nThe growth of national societies, of national and international\nintellectual and professional communities, of ethnic communities--all of\nthese have grown at the cost of local communities.\n\n\nThe primacy of kinship, as a criterion on the basis of which\nsolidarity was formed, has receded.\n\n\nThe attachment to locality has been attenuated by the extension of\nattachment to larger territories, to provincial or national territories.\n\n\nThere are even instances where attachment to national territories has\nbecome very ineffectual and attachment to transnational territories and to\nhumanity beyond kinship, ethnicity and nationality.  3   \nLimitations \n\n \n\nThe Constitutional Democratic State of India operates under the\nlimitations of Part III of the Constitution which provides for Fundamental\nRights for individuals which protect not only the political rights but also\ncultural rights of every citizen of India, including the minorities.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court of India, as a guardian of the constitutional\ndemocracy, is a watchdog of Fundamental Rights of the Indian citizens.\n\n\nThe concept of individual rights has expanded in the Western Liberal\nDemocratic theory where good governance depends on deference to Human Rights\nof the citizens.\n\n\nDurga Das Basu observes:  \" The ambit of the freedom of\nreligion guaranteed by Articles 25 and 26 has been widened by the judicial\ninterpretation that what is guaranteed by Articles 25 and 26 is the right of\n the  individual  to practise and\npropagate not only matters of faith or belief but also those rituals and\nobservances which are regarded as integral parts of a religion by the\nfollowers of its doctrine\"  .  4  \n\n \n\nThus, the greatest human right of Indians, in a highly religious\nsociety, which also happens to be the home of all major religions and belief\nsystems of the world, has been fully guaranteed by the consitutional\ndemocratic State of India and Durga Das Basu observes:  \" The\nsum-total of the above provisions make our State more secular than even the\nUnited States of Aemrica\"  .  5    Human Rights as\nthe Yardstick \n\n \n\nSecularism in India is a necessary but not a sufficient condition\nfor the modern liberal theorists to accept that individual citizen in India\nhas enough freedom to develop his own potential. \n\n \n\nStephen Macedo in  Capitalism, Citizenship and Community\n states that  \" The authors of  Habits of the Heart  (\nRobert N. Bellah, Richard Madsen, William M. Sullivan, Ann Swindler, and\nSteven M. Tripton) charge that America is losing the institutions that help\nto create the kind of person who could sustain a connection to a wider\npolitical community and thus ultimately support the maintenance of free\ninstitutions  \"   .  6 \n\n\nIf the home of liberal democracy is castigated for crippling\nindividual rights, liberal democrats cannot fully accept that the Indian\nState protects, preserves and promotes Human Rights.\n\n\nStephen  own position is:  \" Liberals who\ntake Tocqueville seriously should be concerned about \nconnections with larger wholes than sustain their allegiance while supporting\ntheir individuality, their liberty, and their capacity for self-government.\n\n\nIt is not enough to hold out a vision of a selfless social harmony\nthat is incapable of attracting the energetic support of people as we know\nthem\"  .  7  \n\n \n\nThe yardstick of the Western Democratic Liberals is freedom for\nthe individuals and the nature of the State.\n\n\nEvery Democratic and Constitutional State will be scrutinised on the\nbasis of its Human Rights record and India cannot be an exception to this\nrule.\n\n\nThe critique of Indian State by the Indian liberals is on the basis\nof the actual practice of the institutions of the State in dealing with the\nissues of individual rights and justice. \n\n \n\nThe European Marxist writers, like Ralph Miliband and N.\nPoulantzas from 1970s and early 1980s, drew their inspiration from Italian\ncommunist philosopher Gramsci and they have maintained that   \"\n the capitalist State has ideological apparatuses and administrative\ncoercive apparatuses to govern for the extraction of surplus value.\n\n\nEvery capitalist State hegemonises on the \nbasis of its ideology and the citizens are conditioned to view the capitalist\nState a  ` legitimate'  .\n\n\nA critique of State emerges only when we concentrate on the issues of\nState Hegemony, Legitimacy and the role of the apparatuses of the State\"\n  8  . \n\n \n\nThe sum and substance of the discussion in the preceding paras is\nthat the formal, legal and institutional structure of the democratic,\npluralist, federal and welfare Constitutional State of India is a framework\nwhich is based on normative and many ethical principles with emphasis on\nlegality which takes care of political and social morality.\n\n\nBut the actual practice of the constitutional State of India cannot\nbe understood without focusing attention on some real processes of politics\nwhich seem to be contrary to the images of the Constitution makers.  \nMirrors Reality of Indian Politics \n\n \n\nIt was the explicit and the implicit premise of the Constitution\nmakers that universal adult franchise with regular elections will make a\nhighly apathetic and a political society quite politicised and socially\nassertive.\n\n\nConstitutional Democratic State of India has held ten elections to\nthe Lower House of the Indian Parliament and regular elections for the State\nAssemblies and by 73rd Amendment of the Constitution, regular elections for\nthe local self-governing institutions have been made legally compulsory.\n\n\nA Democratic State gains in legitimacy where people participate in\ngovernance through regular elections and hold the political executive\naccountable and  ` responsible'  to use the concept of\nFriedrich and Maclver.\n\n\nFor Marxists, if a State has strong legitimacy, its capacities to\nhegemonise its citizens increase and the coercive apparatuses of the State\nare not employed in a ruthless manner to deal with  protests\nand struggles.\n\n\nSimilarly the Western Liberal Democrats concede that States with\nstrong democratic and electoral legitimacy are relatively better in\nprotecting Human rights than the States which have weak democratic\nlegitimacy.\n\n\nThe democratic legitimacy of the Indian State has been seriously\nquestioned by the Liberals and the Marxists.\n\n\nThe Liberals in India have maintained that the election process is\ncompletely vitiated and rigged.\n\n\nThe glowing corruption of the electoral process has eroded the\nlegitimacy of the demoratic and constitutional State of India.\n\n\nThe Indian political class is manufacturing electoral legitimacy\nthrough completely unfair electoral practices.\n\n\nThe consitutional democratic State of India has lost its moral\nfoundations because it is based on manipulated and rigged electoral process.\n\n\nThe pillar of democratic and constitutional State of India is  vote and this pillar lies in shambles.\n\n\nIf elections have become illegitimate, if Indian democratic, federal\nand constitutional State is also illegitimate, the \nphilosophy of the Constitution makers has met with its Waterloo because of\nthe actual practice of Indian electoral process. \n\n \n\nThe Marxists and many socially  ` marginal groups'\n who are at the  ` periphery'  of the society maintain\nthat the democratic State of India has been derailed because instead of\n ` negotiations'  with the deprived groups on demands, it has\nbecome confrontational State.\n\n\nThe Constitution makers laid down the legal framework for  `\naccommodation'  of demands of the labouring classES and cultural\nminority groups.\n\n\nIt was expected that during the last 47 years this process of\npolitical accommodation will get strengthened.\n\n\nUnfortunately failure to accommodate has lead to a situation where\npolitics of coercion as concretised by the bureaucratic and police\napparatuses of the Indian State has emerged more significant than the\npolitics of accommodation.\n\n\nThis trend of suppression of emerging social asseRtions has been\ngrowing and the Indian State had to enact the Terrorist and Disruptive\nActivities ( Prevention) Act ( TADA) 0f 1985.\n\n\nNot only this, the traditional police and paramilitary forces, like\nthe Border Security Force, the Central Reserve Police Force and Armed Police\nForce of every State Government has expanded in numbers and their budgetary\nallocations have increased astronomicaly.\n\n\nFurther, new forces like the Rapid Action Force and 30 battalions of\nthe Rashtriya Rifles, a new para-military arm under the Army Command, has\nbeen created in 1994.\n\n\nThe reason for the establishment of new  Rashtriya Rifles \nis that the army in India is over-stretched in maintaining domestic civil law\nand order.\n\n\nAn Army Officer, makes a telling comment on the creation of the\nRashtriya Rifles as follow:  \" At present some of our boys on internal\nsecurity duties are not even managing one  rest in a week\"\n .  9 \n\n\n India is witnessing growing politicisation alongwith\npolicisation of the society.   EXPLANATIONS FOR WEAKENING OF\nCONSITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC STATE\n\n \n\nRajni Kothari, who has combined positions of superstructural\nanalysis in \"  Politics in India  \"  10\nwith philosophical anarchist perspective in \"  State Against\nDemocracy: In Search of Human Governance,  \"  11 has\nexplained that the crisis of the constitutional State in India is\npost-Nehruvian because the institutions for governance have been\ndelegitimised and destroyed.\n\n\nIf this is the explanation, then institutions for governance should\nbe reformed and restored back to their strength.\n\n\nPolitical executive, bureaucracy, judiciary, Indian federalism and\nall democratic institutions have been completely weakened, and in  analysis  \" restoration of democratic institutions is\nthe need of the hour  \"   .\n\n\nIn this philosophical-anarchist mould, Rajni Kothari observes that\nthe  model of Indian economic and political\ndevelopment has led to the disenfranchisement of the tribals and the cultural\nminority groups of India and it has led to peripheralisation of the majority\nof the people.\n\n\nThe Indian State has lost its legitimacy because the  `\nperipheral'  social groups have not been empowered to use Amartya  concept of Empowerment.\n\n\nAmartya Sen has suggested that if India can spend more resources on\neducation, health and implement land reforms, democratic strength of India\ncan be restored. \n\n\n  Internal and External Vulnerability  \n\n \n\nMarxist critique of the Constitutional Democratic State of India\nis based on historical materialism and political economy approach.\n\n\nMany streams of Marxist critique have emerged during the last 47\nyears.\n\n\nFirst, India has a very  ` skewed'  market and the\nabsolute majority of the people do not have purchasing power.\n\n\nThis is a serious constraint on the political economy of the Indian\nState and unless purchasing power is created by involving the labour classes\nin the productive process of India, the Indian State will remain externally\nand internally vulnerable.\n\n\nIt is a vulnerable State because it has a very narrow social base\nbecause of the type of capitalist path of development followed by it. \n12 \n\n \n\nIndia can resolve its multi-dimensional crises if it can tackle\n ` demand constraint'  by deepening and broadening the Indian\nmarket.\n\n\nThe Indian State is in the danger of losing its sovereignty to global\ncapitalism if it does not address itself to the problems of rural India and\nthe deprivations of the working classes.\n\n\nSecond, a Marxist critique is rooted in the history of State\nformation in India.\n\n\nThe Democratic and Constitutional State of India has emerged out of a\nvery powerful anti-colonial Third World nationalism, but it is a State in the\nprocess of formation and it is a weak State.\n\n\nThe essence of this State is weaker ideological hegemony, weak\npolitical legitimacy and fragmented and fractionalised State institutions for\ngovernance.\n\n\nThis phenomenon needs explanation.  13 \n\n\n  Weak Ideological Hegemony  \n\n \n\nIndia is a multi-structural society where the India State is\nbuilding modern capitalism and modern institutions for governance on the\nbasis of social relations and values which belong to the past.\n\n\nThe present India is haunted by the legacies of the past, like caste,\ncommunity, territoriality and social exclusivity of superior-subordinate\ncultural hierarchies.\n\n\nThe Indian State does not have ideological hegemony because India is\ninvolved in a  basic struggle to fight against the\nhangovers of the traditional identities with the values of egalitarianism,\nsecularism and democracy of the modern State system.\n\n\nThis social and cultural struggle is fundamental and it has complex\npolitical manifestations.\n\n\nIf on the one hand, the modern Indian State is crippled by the\nhangovers of the appeals of the historical past, on the other, economic\ndevelopment of India is based on class-differentials, regional differentials,\nrural-urban disparities, rich States and backward States conflicts and the\nglobal pressures of the New World Political and economic Order.\n\n\nThe leader of the New World Order sees India as a  ` market'\n and it demands from the Indian State maintenance of standards of\nWestern values of governance.\n\n\nThis aspect of external dimensions of the Indian State cannot be\nignored because in the present inter-dependent and highly stratified global\npower relations, the Indian State will have to respond to subtle and\nsometimes open pressures of the aid-giving countries.\n\n\nIt is not only the ideological hegemony of the Indian State which is\nweak because of the conflicts between the continuing power of the past\nhistorical consciousness and the emerging trends of modernisation.\n\n\nSuch a conflict between the inherited loyalites of the past and the\nweak rising forces of modernisation leades to weakening of the democratic\nlegitimacy of the State.\n\n\nThe political class has defamed and drailed the electoral process,\nand the fractions and fragments of the political class have intensified\ncaste, and community, region and religious divisions to create a political\nconstituency for winning elections.\n\n\nIn the process, every poliltical party has become weak and\nsectionalised.  14 \n\n\n  Elections and Sectarianism  \n\n \n\nHow can Indian political executive and bureaucratic institutions\ngain democratic strength when elections have become contest of sectarianism?\n\n\nPolitical leaders have intensified sectarian violent conflicts and it\nrequires regular intervention and involvement of the para-military forces in\nthe routine governance of India.\n\n\nFacts speak for themselves.\n\n\nThe Indian Lower House of the Parliament was informed on August 25,\n1994 that the expenditure on the Border Security Force has been increasing\nevery successive year since 1991 and it has reached a high level of Rs.\n949.13  crore  of 1993-94.\n\n\nThe annual expenditure on the BSF for 1991-92 was Rs. 719.24 \ncrore  and for 1992-93 it was Rs. 80.52  crore. \n15 \n\n\n CONCLUSION \n\n \n\nIt may be mentioned that if politics and elections are reformed\nalong with the reform of bureaucracy and judiciary, governance of India will\nbe according to the spirit and not to the letter of the Indian Constitution.\n\n\nWhile reforming the  is a necessary condition\nfor governance of the  country, it is not a\nsufficient condition to deal with the deeper multidimensional crises of the\nConstitutional Democratic State of India.\n\n\nIf politicisation of India is a positive sign of democratisation of\nIndian society, the growing policisation is a sign of growing social\ndiscontent in the country.\n\n\nIndia is involved in a dialectical process of a conflict between the\npositive and the negative as reflected in the democratisation of society as\nwell as policisation of the country.  16\n\n\nMany post-Marxists, who believe in class politics, and liberal\ndemocrats have drawn our attention to  the autonomy of the political\n .\n\n\nWithout going into the details of the relative autonomy of the\nState, it will suffice to say that if sectarianism of politics is continued\nunchecked, the State apparatus will become captive for, by and of the\ndominant sectarian groups.\n\n\nSuch a process is at work in India which is reflected in caste \nversus  caste, community versus community, region  versus \nregion and tribe  versus  tribe politics.  17\n\n\nIn such a situation, relative autonomy of the State becomes a\ndistant dream.    1 Carl J.

Dhawan, Sondhi and Suman\nlast month. \n\n\nOf the others, I met our Dr. Mohite at Salzburg, and\nhave had several  \nletters from our past President, Dr. Kamath. \n\n\nDr Vimla Rao also wrote to me giving a brief report of\nour last  \nconference at Lucknow. \n\n\nDr. Gaur and Dr. Anand also wrote encouraging letters.\n\n\nNow I am worried about the others. \n\n\nDr. V.Y.D.

{"text": "Graham Greene is one of the leading figure in  the  field\nof literature of England.\n\n\nHe is  main Literary  exporter.\n\n\nHis novels are read all over the world where English is spoken.\n\n\n ` Heart of the Matter'  is his best known novel which\nis praised all over the world. \n\n \n\nMr. Scobie is the hero of  novel  \" Heart\nof the Matter\"  .\n\n\nHe is pathetic and tragic figure at the end of the novel.\n\n\nAt the beginning Scobie is police officer.\n\n\nHe is very just, loyal to his profession.\n\n\nPity for all is the key-note to his character.\n\n\nHe is called  \" Scobie the just.\" \n\n\nHe is police ( English ) officer serving in   \nNorthern   part of Africa in British Colony.\n\n\nHe    was   married to Louise and  at the time of marriage he had promised Louise all happiness in his\nlife time.\n\n\nLouise was not very beautiful but still their marital life was going\non  very well.\n\n\nScobie did not receive any bribery in his life time but now his wife\nLouise want to go to South Africa out of    boredom\n  at  North Africa.\n\n\nSo Scobie had to take money from Yusuf on loan with low interest.\n\n\nYusuf being a smuggler  conscience was not clear to\nloan some money from Yusuf but circumstances compelled him to borrow money\nfrom him.\n\n\nYusuf took advantage of situation and sought help of Scobie in\nillegal    business   of diamond transaction.\n\n\n \n\nOnce       life\nwas smoothly running.\n\n\nNow there came in Mrs Helen Rolt.\n\n\nShe caught on the    wretched\ntorpedoed   boat by which she and her husband were coming.\n\n\nThey were just married two    days   early.\n\n\nNow  Scobie went to take stock of situation.\n\n\nHe saw young beautiful girl \n\n\nShe was Ninteen years of age.\n\n\nVery beautiful, young and innocent.\n\n\nNow Scobie fell in love with her.\n\n\nHelen too got attracted towards him as there was no other go.\n\n\nScobie was not libertine.\n\n\nHis attraction towards Helen is not out of sexual motives, but God\nwanted that.\n\n\nNow Scobie is fixed.\n\n\nHe is in    dilemma   .\n\n\nOn one side he had promised his wife Louise all happiness and    on   other side his temptation of flesh. \n\n \n\nScobie is stern Catholic.\n\n\nHe used to go to church regularly.\n\n\nTold his sins and asked pardon.\n\n\n Father Rank was his best friend, but now he was not\nwilling to go to church.\n\n\nStarted telling lies.\n\n\nHe had firm belief in God.\n\n\nHe knew that the game which he    was  \nplaying with his wife and beloved Helen    was  \ncontrary to his spiritual knowledge.\n\n\nNow neither can he leave Louise nor Helen.\n\n\n\" The Heart of the matter \" is that he is caught in\n   dilemma   . \n\n \n\nHe never wanted to hurt any of them.\n\n\nSo he decided to commit suicide and that is the only alternative\nto this problem.\n\n\nSo he commited suicide.\n\n\nThus Scobie is very pathetic figure at the end of  the  novel.\n\n\nSpiritual, & catholic knowledge about evil, sin and subsequent\ndamnation unbalanced his equation of life.\n\n\nHe never wanted to  give pain to both the Ladies.\n\n\nThus only solution he could find is suicide.\n\n\nHis knowledge of good and evil brought the tragic end to his\nglorious,  innocent life.\n\n\nThus he misses both the world of spiritual and of temptations. \n\n \n\nGreene has characterised his hero  very superbly.\n\n\nWhole action is centered around this, single character.\n\n\nThus Henry Scobie is best artistic creation of Graham Greene. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n \" Mall Flanders\"  is very   \nsuperb   novel by Daniel Defoe.\n\n\nIt is  blend of ( realistic ) social novel and\npicturesque novel.\n\n\nIt is  great genius that he made this imaginary  character realistic.\n\n\nMall is a central character in this novel.\n\n\nShe is shown to be whore and criminal but what went in making her\nwhore and thief is note worthy.\n\n\nAs every writer    cannot   avoid the\ntime in which he had lived.\n\n\nThus social conditions too get reflected in his writing.\n\n\nNovel is \" interpretation of human life \" though \n  fictitious   still  it has to\nbe some typical reality in it. \n\n \n\nMall is born at Newgate prison.\n\n\nHer mother was whore and criminal.\n\n\nIn the childhood she lived with Gypsies then she was    handed   over to nurse and then to one well-to-do family.\n\n\nAs  birth has taken place at prison from the whore\nwhat can be predicted of her life afterwards.\n\n\nYet she came to good family.\n\n\nShe got a little education at this house    and\n  she became young and attractive.\n\n\nThus Robin, a boy in a house praised her beauty and gave money and\nseduced her.\n\n\nThis is the first step of her whoredom.\n\n\nThen she married to younger brother of his, Robert.\n\n\nThus she now became wife of one brother and mistress of another.\n\n\nNow she lost her husband and she got two sons by this husband.\n\n\nNow she got  <*> pound </*> 1200 was free  to go any where  without children.\n\n\nShe felt that money was great security of life.\n\n\nThus she wanted to be wife of some wealthy husband.\n\n\nSo she married one    linen   draper but\nhe too proved unmatched.\n\n\nHe himself was in debt so he left Moll and went away.\n\n\n\" Moll \" too changed her name as \" Mall\n\" Flanders here.\n\n\nNow again she was alone without any security & money.\n\n\nShe now married to one Gentleman.\n\n\nHe took her to Virginia    where   he had\ngood plantation.\n\n\nShe got two children out of this husband.\n\n\nHer    mother-in-law was  \nvery kind but during their discussion Moll could understand that she is her\nreal mother and she had married  her own brother.\n\n\nThus again she left the house in Virginia came to London.\n\n\nNow she came in contact of Governess who got Moll married to\nGentleman who  actually was Highway man.\n\n\nThus she left this man though she  loved him  much.\n\n\nNow she came in contact of one Gentleman who got \n   bored   by family life.\n\n\nThus to pass the time he came to Moll.\n\n\nHe  left Moll because of his unhealthy physical condition.\n\n\n \n\nNow Moll has become quite old had  no charm\nthat had in her young age.    Thus   she\nstarted    thieving   and became expert in that\nprofession.\n\n\nShe robbed innocent children and picked bags from shops.\n\n\nShe did all these things out of  scarcity of money.\n\n\nFinally she  was  caught by police while stealing and sent to\nNewgate prison where she was born and on request by priest transported to\nVirginia alongwith Highway man.\n\n\nShe prospered there and came to London as   \nwell-to-do   lady. \n\n \n\nThus social conditions have made Moll whore and thief.\n\n\nHad the boy in house not seduced her first time her life would have\nbeen different.\n\n\nHad    her   husband not died her life\ncould have  been  different.\n\n\nLack of money gave her instability in her life so she went on from\none person to other to get security and money, but most of the time she could\nnot do well because of society. \n\n \n\nShe became thief, it is sheer out of poverty.\n\n\nThus her whole life was unstable because of social circumstances.\n\n\nIn those days women were looked down upon who had no fortune  and\n could not get good husband.\n\n\nWomen were considered inferior to men.\n\n\nEducation was provided only to upper-class ladies, that is why Moll\ncould not get proper education. \n\n \n\nThus her poverty, lack of education no parentage, social evil\navailable at the time of   life  made Moll criminal.\n\n\nHer misfortune too played great role in making her criminal.\n\n\nSocial atmosphere too plays greater role in making her whore, thief\nand criminal.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \" Great Expectations\"  is  well\nknown novel and  conversion in to play form is manifestation of\nits achievement.\n\n\n This novel  is just like a well made\nplay.\n\n\nIt has been divided    into   three acts\nand at the end of every act it is told that the end of respective    acts.  \n\n\nThis play is very  dramatic.\n\n\nIt continuously changes  and develops. \n\n \n\nThis is the story of young man Pip who is living along with his\nsister Mrs    Gargery   and brother-in-law Mr.\nJoe    Gargery   .\n\n\nHe is blacksmith by profession.\n\n\nPip had to help him in his business.\n\n\nJoe was kind to Pip though Mrs Gargery was little tough.\n\n\nOnce Pip came across one  convict who escaped\nfrom prison and police  were searching him.\n\n\nHis name is  Abel Magwitch, who later on turned to\nbe  benefactor.\n\n\nThere lived one landlady Miss Havisham.\n\n\nShe was deceived on the day of her wedding and thus she is still in\nsame    attire   since then and eager to take\nvengeance on whole of manhood.\n\n\nShe has adopted one daughter Stella which later on confirmed  was of Mr Abel    Magwitch   .\n\n\n \n\nNow once Pip gets information  that  great expectations are awaited for Pip.\n\n\nThus Pip goes to London for education and learning aristrocratic\nmanners.\n\n\nHe  by the    time  \nforgets Joe and dislikes his profession.\n\n\nPip thinks that his benefactor is Miss Havisham who wants to make\nhim suitable match for Stella.\n\n\nBut when Mr Magwitch visits Pip at London and \ntells him that he is the  benefactor, his dreams  are \nshattered.\n\n\nHe never wanted his benefactor to be a convict.\n\n\nHe started despising Joe but when he    is\nin   debt and falls ill, Joe helps him look after him well.\n\n\nThese  moves his heart.\n\n\nStella is married to Mr Prembroke but their marriage is not a\nsuccess.\n\n\nHe helps Mr Magwitch to go to Australia as police is behind him.\n\n\nHe also helps Miss Havisham when her clothes   \ncatch   on fire.\n\n\nThus change comes in Pip in his behaviour.\n\n\nNow he come   home and when  he \nvisits old mansion he finds Stella all alone.\n\n\nHe takes her hand  never to part. \n\n \n\nThis is the very touching &    gripping\n  story and plot construction.\n\n\nThere are no digressions.\n\n\nStory going on very smoothly, which act    no \n obstruction. \n\n \n\nCharacterisation is superb.\n\n\n evolution is gradual from boyish attitude to maturity\nto humanitarian attitude.\n\n\nThus hero has developed properly.\n\n\nCharacter of Joe is another good creation.\n\n\nHe has fatherly feelings towards Pip.\n\n\nMrs Gargery is not sketched properly as she has no role  to \nplay.\n\n\nMr Jagger is  lawyer who is devoted to  his \nown profession and does not tell any secret.\n\n\nHe talks very less.\n\n\nStella is puppet in the    hands   of\nMiss Havisham.\n\n\nAt last she marries Pip.\n\n\nMr    Abel Magwitch    has greater role to play.\n\n\nThus characterisation is very superb.\n\n\nNo character is unwanted.\n\n\nAll help to compose good story. \n\n \n\nPlay is divided in acts into three equal  \n divisions   ( 1)  boyhood, help to convict ( 2) his\nlife at London ( 3) his life after Return from London and marriage with\nStella. \n\n \n\nThe theme is that spiritual development of a man has more\nexpectation than earthly prosperous development.\n\n\nHero passes from boyish attitude to humanitorian love at the end of\nplay. \n\n \n\n   Imagery   and symbols are used\naptly.\n\n\n   Blacksmith   symbolises\nreality.\n\n\nHand cuffs shows reality and notorious life. \n\n \n\nThus this novel is superb creation of Charles Dickens.\n\n\nThis novel has been transformed    into \n good play, and its theatrical success has great manifestation of success\nof novel form also.  \n\n \n\n \n\n20th century is the century of novel as all aspects of complex\nlife is reflected in it.\n\n\nEarlier conditions prevailed for novel writing were different than\nthose available in 20th century.\n\n\nThere is lot of influence from the  foreign agency\nlike Russian writers like Tolstoy,    Gorky   ,\n   some   French novelist like Balzac,    Maughm   .\n\n\nThere were influences from Belgium, Scandinavian.\n\n\nRussian shown the sweep of the canvas of the novel form.\n\n\nFrench taught the delicacy and depth in the novel. \n\n \n\nWar conditions made good impact on the mind of reader and\nwriter. \n\n \n\nIn 20th century external description of the matter is not\nimportant but internal working is important.\n\n\nNow this age is of space age\n\n\nThere are so many war and peace is disturbed.\n\n\nThere is no stability in the mind of youth and reader.\n\n\nThus his mind is occupied by so many problems, and  human life has more of internal work or rather mental work  as is physical work.\n\n\nThus psychological novel came into being. \n\n \n\nJames Joyce has started psychological novel and that has been\nenriched in later years.\n\n\nNow there is lot    of   development  in the field of psychology and the character could be\nanalysed by sitting in the Laboratory. \n\n \n\nLawrence   \" Tristran Shandy\" \nis a whimsical novel.\n\n\nThis is one of  the  form of psychological novel, as Hero of\nthis novel is never born till half of the novel is over.    Thus the   whole narration is of       whims and    fancies  \n\n\n \n\nThus  environment, war conditions, space age,\nsocial, economical, political problems   \n have given   ample food for the individual  writers  for\nthinking and that is reflected in the novels. \n\n \n\n novels are not for enjoyment but they portray\nor    compile   some   \nproblems.   \n\n \n\nThese    novels   \nhave  20th century  art form,    various   techniques  have been made  like flashback method, stream of conscience method are used amply\nby these novelist. \n\n \n\nConcept of time has been changed and thus stream of    consciousness   method has be employed. \n\n \n\nThomas Hardy  wrote many novels on the basis of\npsychology.\n\n\nFor him nature is not    benevolent \n or helpful to man. \n\n \n\nThus psychological novels give    glimpses\n  of mind of the writer or  view point of the\nwriter about some matter.\n\n\nThis is only for the reader to assess only what is there in writers\nmental horizon to say about the particular  situation or\nmatter. \n\n \n\nPsychological novels thus, suit the changing conditions of the\nworld today and the    novels   are expected to\nflourish for some time more.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a0091e13-485b-4c33-b38e-c1935e226bd9", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.014468+00:00"}

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ( \" ICAI\n\" ) has constituted an Accounting Standards Board to assist its\nCouncil in the preparation of accounting standards.\n\n\n2. \" ICAI \" has set up the Auditing Standards Board\nagain to assist in its Council the preparation of auditing standards.\n\n\n3. The Government of India has set up the Securities and Exchange\nBoard of India ( \" SEBI \" ) to regulate the functioning of\nthe stock market and the securities industry.\n\n\n4. There has been an increase in the opportunities available to\ninvestors to channel their funds into equity investments through financial\nintermediaries like mutual funds.\n\n\n5. There has been an increase in the number of stock brokers in the\ncountry in response to the increased volume of trading and investment in\nsecurities during the last few years.\n\n\n6. There has been an explosion in the number of investment magazines\nseeking to provide investors with data on a more timely basis than is done by\nthe  annual report.\n\n\n7. The Companies Act as amended in 1988 provides for the circulation\nof abridged financial statements to investors, departing from the time\nhonoured practice of providing the users of financial statements like\nshareholders with complete data as required under the company law.\n\n\n8. Financial institutions have jointly established a credit rating\nagency. Credit Rating and Information Services of India Ltd. as an autonomous\nbody to publish credit ratings of companies. \n\n\n  IMPACT OF CHANGES ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF REPORTING \n\n\n \n\nThe current corporate financial reporting scene in the light of\nthe above developments is analysed below in order to understand the emerging\nrole of financial reporting, with audited financial statements at the core.\n\n\n \n\nConventionally, accountants have assumed that audited financial\nstatements are the sole source of information to the decision-makers who use\nfinancial statements.\n\n\nIt is normally presumed that the ordinary investor is  \"\nnative\"  , meaning  thereby the investor takes the financial\nfigures presented to him uncritically. \n\n\nIt is necessary to ponder over the continued relevance of these\nassumptions on the part of accountants in the context of the available\nevidence: \n\n \n\n( a) Investors do not use the financial information directly to\nmake investment decisions.\n\n\nThey have options of engaging specialists like analysts and brokers\nto interpret financial information or to assign their investment activity to\nspecialist financial intermediaries.\n\n\nThis is possible in India in the new context with the availability of\na larger number of stock brokers, investment advisers and counsellors and\nmutual funds like the ones started by \" SBI \" Capital\nMarkets, Unit Trust of India and Canbank Financial Services.\n\n\nHence, the assumption that investors are solely responsible for\ninterpreting financial data seems to be an over-simplified view of the\ninvestment scene. \n\n \n\n( b) Investors also have the opportunities of getting more timely\ninformation from financial dailies and investment magazines.\n\n\nBesides presenting timely and relevant information, these periodicals\nalso provide a critical evaluation of the accounting and auditing practices\nconcerning some companies. \n\n \n\n( c) Information on the direct use of financial statements by\ninvestors is not available in India as no major study has been conducted to\nascertain their reliance on financial statement data.\n\n\nRecently, a survey of investors has been commissioned by some leading\nfinancial institutions in India.\n\n\nIn the absence of clear evidence to show that investors use\naccounting numbers, such as earnings per share, to improve the quality of\nreporting, entailing substantial costs to prepares may be of doubtful value.\n\n\n\n  REGULATION OF ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING STANDARDS \n\n\n \n\nThe formation of the Accounting Standard Board by \" ICAI\n\" for developing accounting standards is an important development\nfor several reasons.\n\n\n Firstly, this is the maiden attempt by any agency in India to\nreduce  the number of accounting alternatives available to management.\n\n\nSo far, \" ICAI \" has only reacted sporadically to\nfinancial reporting issues, for example, capitalisation of interest,\ntreatment of retirement gratuity in financial statements, etc.\n\n\n Secondly,  \" ICAI \" has made it clear that\nit would like to  enforce  accounting standards on industry.\n\n\nEnforcement of accounting standards is sought to be done by requiring\nexternal auditors of companies to point out deviations from the standards\ndeclared to be mandatory by \" ICAI \" .\n\n\nThe legal position in India is that company management shall present\nfinancial statements that show a  \" true and fair view\"  of\nprofit and financial position.\n\n\nThe need for accounting standards which seek to ensure uniformity in\naccounting policies followed by various enterprises has to be justified in\nthe light of the  \" true and fair view\"  approach under the\nCompanies Act.\n\n\nThe \" ICAI \" has no formal powers of enforcement of\naccounting standards on preparers of financial statements.\n\n\n Thirdly,  Securities and Exchange Board of India (\n\" SEBI \" ) had declared its intention to develop appropriate\naccounting and auditing standards in consultation with \" ICAI\n\" .\n\n\n\" SEBI \" is going to be a statutory body ( currently\nit is functioning as an agency of the Government ) responsible to Parliament\nfor its functioning.\n\n\nWhether SEBI can assign its role in formulating financial reporting\nrequirements including accounting standards to a non-Governmental  professional body such as \" ICAI \" is an\nopen issue.\n\n\nAlternatively, \" SEBI \" may find it attractive to\nrequire ICAI to develop accounting standards and subject the standards to\nsome scrutiny ( real or nominal as may be required ) before giving legal\nsanction to them.\n\n\nThe involvement of \" SEBI \" in setting accounting\nstandards is also likely to take the accounting standards into the political\narena resulting in technical issues of measurement receiving lower attention.\n\n\nEconomic consequences of accounting standards such as fall in the\nrates of capital formation, change in resource allocation, etc. may receive\ngreater attention at the hands of a statutory body like \" SEBI\n\" compared to the amount of attention paid to such consequences by\n\" ICAI \" . \n\n \n\n involvement in setting\nauditing standards is also likely to have a major impact on the regulation of\nthe auditing profession in India.\n\n\nAt present, the auditing profession in India regulates its affairs\nwithin the limits laid down under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949.\n\n\n\" SEBI \" may assume a more active role in exercising\ncontrol over the quality, quantity and type of professional services auditors\nmay render.\n\n\nThese projections are supported by developments in the U.S.A. where\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission has emerged as a powerful regulator in\nthe securities business in general and financial reporting in particular.\n\n\n\n  SOME COMMENTS ON MANAGEMENT BEHAVIOUR  \n\n \n\nThe annual report of a company generally contains the following:\n\n\n1. Financial statements, i.e., profit and loss account and balance\nsheet;\n\n\n2. Notes on financial statements;\n\n\n3.  report on financial statements and notes;\n\n\n4.  report providing a review of the  activities; and\n\n\n5.  statement on the  prospects.\n\n\n \n\nThere has been frequent criticism of the practices followed by\ncompanies in reporting some items in financial statements.\n\n\nThe allied criticism has been on the role of auditing in relation to\npractices considered unsuitable.\n\n\nIt would be inappropriate to comment freely on the practices of\ncompanies in financial reporting.\n\n\nThere is no comprehensive code of generally accepted accounting\nprinciples ( \" GAAP \" ) in India.\n\n\nWhile certain principles like accrual are well established,\nexceptions to these principles in practices are not unknown, often ignored by\nauditors reporting on the statements-for example, accounting for bonus on\ncash basis.\n\n\nMore importantly, it would be simplistic to expect a corporate\nmanagement to adopt a set of accounting policies considered  technically\n sound by some users or by some other companies since the objectivies of\ncorporate management in financial reporting are likely to be different from\nthe objectives of other parties and, perhaps, righly so.\n\n\nHence, there appears to be no end to many of the so called accounting\n \" abuses\"  one always comes across in corporate reports.\n\n\nThere are situations in which management thinks it has to report\nfigures differently from what GAAP would require it to do.\n\n\nIf necessary, the management may even opt for a qualified audit\nreport rather than blindly follow GAAP.\n\n\nThe only issue then would be whether the management explains the\ncircumstances for a departure from \" GAAP \" in sufficient\ndetails so that users of financial statements are given the information\nnecessary to compare financial information of the company with its past and\nwith other companies.\n\n\nSo long as the information is provided by the management and the\nauditor, there may not be much point in users complaining of non-uniformity\nin financial statements.\n\n\nThe point made earlier that faced with a choice between GAAP and\nqualified audit report the management would opt for the latter, was proved a\nfew years ago in the case of the widespread accounting practice of\ncapitalisation of interest relating to the post-commissioning period.\n\n\nIf a company management had cared for the so called technical\nconsiderations in accounting, it would not have accepted qualified audit\nreports.\n\n\nBy choosing to have qualified reports, corporate managers made it\nclear that their stakes in a dispute concerning the amount of investment\nallowance were too high to be ignored in order to satisfy some accounting\nrequirements.\n\n\nSuch behaviour of the management is to be expected and considered by\naccounting policy-makers. \n\n\n  ROLE OF EXTERNAL AUDITORS  \n\n \n\n reports sometimes contain serious\nqualifications.\n\n\nThe claim that financial statements give a  \" true and fair\nview\"  subject to the qualifications is contradictory.\n\n\nOne approach is to consider whether the qualified report should be\ndone away with.\n\n\nAnother approach is to prescribe materially standards for items in\nthe financial statements, which would ensure that once a materiality\nthreshold is crossed, qualification of the report becomes automatic.\n\n\nThe Auditing Standards Board of ICAI may study the circumstances\nunder which audit reports are qualified to gain insight into the causes and\nextent of qualified reports.  <*> small square</*>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "31debdb7-2878-42da-bd0f-dca0b6a8a4de", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.015775+00:00"}
{"text": "Dust on the Mountain \n\n\nby RUSKIN BOND\n\n\nillustrations by SUDDHASATTWA BASU\n\n \n\n Winter  came and went, without so much as a drizzle.\n\n\nThe hillside was brown all summer and the fields were bare.\n\n\nThe old plough that was dragged over the hard ground by  lean oxen made hardly any impression.\n\n\nStill, Bisnu kept his seeds ready for sowing.\n\n\nA good monsoon, and there would be plenty of maize and rice to see the\nfamily through the next winter. \n\n \n\nSummer went its scorching way, and a few clouds gathered on the\nsouth-western horizon. \n\n \n\n \" The monsoon is coming,\"  announced Bisnu. \n\n \n\nHis sister Puja was at the small stream, washing clothes.\n\n\n \" If it doesn't come soon, the stream will dry up,\" \nshe said.\n\n\n \" See,  only a trickle this year.\n\n\nRemember when there were so many different flowers growing here on\nthe banks of the stream?\n\n\nThis year there isn't one.\"      \n\n \n\n \" The winter was dry.\n\n\nIt did not even snow,\"  said Bisnu. \n\n \n\n \" I cannot remember another winter when there was no\nsnow,\"  said his mother.\n\n\n \" The year your father died, there was so much snow the\nvillagers could not light his funeral-pyre for hours <*> dotted line</*>\n\n\nAnd now there are fires everywhere.\" \n\n\nShe pointed to the next mountain, half-hidden by the smoke from a\nforest fire. \n\n \n\nAt night they sat outside their small house, watching the fire\nspread.\n\n\nA red line stretched right across the mountain.\n\n\nThousands of Himalayan trees were perishing in the flames.\n\n\nOaks,  deodars  , maples, pines; trees that had taken\nhundreds of years to grow.\n\n\nAnd now a fire started carelessly by some woodcutters had been\ncarried up the mountain with the help of the dry grass and a strong breeze.\n\n\nThere was no-one to put it out.\n\n\nIt would take days to die down. \n\n \n\n \" If the monsoon arrives tomorrow, the fire will go\nout,\"  said Bisnu, ever the optimist.\n\n\nHe was only twelve, but he was the man in the house; he had to see\nthat there was enough food for the family and for the oxen, for the big black\ndog and the hens. \n\n \n\nThere were clouds the next day but they brought only a drizzle.\n\n\n \n\n \"  just the beginning,\"  said Bisnu\nas he placed a bucket of muddy water on the steps. \n\n \n\n \" It usually starts with a heavy downpour,\"  said\nhis mother. \n\n \n\nBut there were to be no downpours that year.\n\n\nClouds gathered on the horizon but they were white and puffy and soon\ndisappeared.\n\n\nTrue monsoon clouds would have been dark and heavy with moisture.\n\n\nThere were other signs - - or lack of them - - that warned of a long\ndry summer.\n\n\nThe birds were silent, or simply absent.\n\n\nThe Himalayan barbet, who usually heralded the approach of the\nmonsoon with strident calls from the top of a spruce tree, hadn't been seen\nor heard.\n\n\nAnd the cicadas, who played a deafening overture in the oaks at the\nfirst hint of rain, seemed to be missing altogether. \n\n \n\n apricot tree usually gave them a basket full of\nfruit every summer.\n\n\nThis year it produced barely a handful of apricots, lacking juice and\nflavour.\n\n\nThe tree looked ready to die, its leaves curled up in despair.\n\n\nFortunately there was a store of walnuts, and a binful of wheat-grain\nand another of rice stored from the previous year, so they would not be\nentirely without food; but it looked as though there would be no fresh fruit\nor vegetables.\n\n\nAnd there would be nothing to store away for the following winter.\n\n\nMoney would be needed to buy supplies in Tehri, some thirty miles\ndistant.\n\n\nAnd there was no money to be earned in the village. \n\n \n\n \" I will go to Mussoorie and find work,\" \nannounced Bisnu.\n\n\n \" But Mussoorie is a two-day journey by bus,\"  said\nhis mother. \n\n \n\n \" There is no-one there who can help you.\n\n\nAnd you may not get any work.\"  \n\n \n\n \" In Mussoorie there is plenty of work during the summer.\n\n\nRich people come up from the plains for their holidays.\n\n\nIt is full of hotels and shops and places where they can spend their\nmoney.\"  \n\n \n\n \" But they won't spend any money on  you  .\"\n \n\n \n\n \" There is money to be made there.\n\n\nAnd if not, I will come home.\n\n\nI can walk back over the Nag Tibba mountain.\n\n\nIt will take only two and a half days and I will save the bus fare!\"\n \n\n \n\n \" Don't go,  bhai  , \"  pleaded\nPuja.\n\n\n \" There will be no-one to prepare your food - - you will only\nget sick.\"  \n\n \n\nBut Bisnu had made up his mind so he put a few belongings in a\ncloth shoulder-bag, while his mother prised several rupee-coins out of a\ncache in the wall of their living room.\n\n\nPuja prepared a special breakfast of  parathas  and an\negg scrambled with onions, the hen having laid just one for the occasion.\n\n\nBisnu put some of the  parathas  in his bag.\n\n\nThen, waving goodbye to his mother and sister, he set off down the\nroad from the village. \n\n \n\nAfter walking for a mile, he reached the highway where there was\na hamlet with a bus stop.\n\n\nA number of villagers were waiting patiently for a bus.\n\n\nIt was an hour late but they were used to that.\n\n\nAs long as it arrived safely and got them to their destination, they\nwould be content.\n\n\nThey were patient people.\n\n\nAnd although Bisnu wasn't quite so patient, he too had learnt how to\nwait - - for late buses and late monsoons. \n\n \n\nAlong the valley and over the mountains went the little bus with\nits load of frail humans. \n\n \n\n \" How tiny we are,\"  thought Bisnu, looking up at\nthe towering peaks and the immensity of sky.\n\n\n \" Each of us no more than a raindrop <*> dotted line</*>\n\n\nAnd I wish we had a few raindrops!\"  \n\n \n\nThere were still fires burning to the north but the road went\nsouth, where there were no forests anyway, just bare brown hillsides.\n\n\nDown near the river there were small paddy fields but     unfortunately rivers ran downhill and not uphill, and there was no\ninexpensive way in which the water could be brought up the steep slopes to\nthe fields that depended on rainfall. \n\n \n\nBisnu stared out of the bus window at the river running far\nbelow.\n\n\nOn either bank huge boulders lay exposed, for the level of the water\nhad fallen considerably during the past few months. \n\n \n\n \" Why are there no trees here?\"  he asked aloud,\nand received the attention of a fellow passenger, an old man in the next seat\nwho had been keeping up a relentless dry coughing.\n\n\nEven though it was a warm day, he wore a woollen cap and had an old\nmuffler wrapped about his neck. \n\n \n\n \" There were trees here once,\"  he said.\n\n\n \" But the contractors took the  deodars  for\nfurniture and houses.\n\n\nAnd the pines were tapped to death for resin.\n\n\nAnd the oaks were stripped of their leaves to feed the cattle - - you\ncan still see a few tree-skeletons    if   you look\nhard - - and the bushes that remained were finished off by the goats!\"\n \n\n \n\n \" When did all this happen?\"  asked Bisnu. \n\n \n\n \" A few years ago.\n\n\nAnd  still happening in other areas, although  forbidden now to cut trees.\n\n\nThe only forests that remain are in out of the way places where there\nare no roads.\" \n\n\nA fit of coughing came over him, but he had found a good listener and\nwas eager to continue.\n\n\n \" The road helps you and me to get about but it also makes it\neasier for others to do mischief.\n\n\nRich men from the cities come here and buy up what they want - -\nland, trees, people!\"  \n\n \n\n \" What takes you to Mussoorie, uncle?\"  asked\nBisnu politely.\n\n\nHe always addressed elderly people as uncle or aunt. \n\n \n\n \" I have a cough that won't go away.\n\n\nPerhaps they can do something for it at the hospital in Mussoorie.\n\n\nDoctors don't like coming to villages, you know-  no\nmoney to be made in villages.\n\n\nSo we must go to the doctors in the towns I had a brother who could\nnot be cured in Mussoorie.\n\n\nThey told him to go to Delhi.\n\n\nHe sold his buffaloes and went to Delhi, but there they told him it\nwas too late to do anything.\n\n\nHe died on the way back.\n\n\nI won't go to Delhi.\n\n\nI don't wish to die amongst strangers.\"  \n\n \n\n \"  get well, uncle,\"  said Bisnu.\n\n\n \n\n \" Bless you for saying so.\n\n\nAnd you -

{"text": "Androgenic regulation of glycolytic and HMP pathway in epididymis and\nvas  deferens of rhesus monkey  *  \n\n\nG Gupta, A Srivastava & B S Setty <*> dagger</*>   <O> Division of Endocrinology, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow\n226 001, India      \n\n \n\nThe mammalian epididymis is a dynamic organ, and is dependent\nupon testicular androgens for the maintenance of its structure as well as for\nits secretory, resorptive, biosynthetic and other metabolic activities\n   .\n\n\nAll these functions are adversely affected following androgen\nwithdrawal ( e.g. castration or hypophysectomy ) .\n\n\nIn most laboratory animals, castration or hypophysectomy results\nin a rapid decline in the development of sperm fertilizing ability within 4-7\ndays and the loss of sperm viability after 1-2 weeks  \n .\n\n\nHowever, the nature of the androgen dependent processes of the\nepididymis that are essential for sperm maturation and storage remain\nelusive.\n\n\nIt is probable that nourishment of epididymal duct may directly or\nindirectly affect sperm maturation and storage.\n\n\nCarbohydrates ( e.g. glucose ) form a ready source of nourishment for\nmost type of cells in the body.\n\n\nA detailed study of the glycolytic pathway, the primary pathway\nfor intermediary metabolism of carbohydrates, and its androgenic\nregulation in mammalian epididymis, is therefore necessary. Brooks    carried out detailed study of the glycolytic pathway in rat\nepididymis and found it to be testicular dependent.\n\n\nWe carried out similar studies in rhesus monkey epididymis for two\nmain reasons.\n\n\nFirstly, although rat has served as a useful model in many basic\nstudies on epididymal function and sperm  maturation it\nis not certain that this animal can serve as a suitable model for\nunderstanding epididymal function in human male.\n\n\nIn recent years non-human primates are being considered at better\nmodels for studies on reproductive biology and contraception.\n\n\nBesides, the preclinical studies on the development of a\ncontraceptive requires evaluation in a primate model, therefore, it is\nnecessary to have baseline data in commonly used primate model such as the\nrhesus monkey.\n\n\nSecondly, Brooks has expressed all the enzyme specific activities as\nunits per gram wet weight of issue.\n\n\nHowever, according to his own findings   \ncastration results in a loss in epididymal weight, which is mainly due to\ncytoplasmic shrinkage rather than due to a change in cell population.\n\n\nThus a unit weight of epididymal tissue in normal and castrated rat\nis likely to have a large difference in the number of cells and therefore,\nthe actual change in enzyme activities within these cells is likely to be\nobscured by a change in their size and weight.\n\n\nOn the other hand DNA, which is the genetic material, is present\nin the same amount in every somatic cell of the body, irrespective of its\nphysiological and metabolic activity and it also remains unchanged\nunder altered physiological conditions.\n\n\nThus a unit weight of DNA represents almost a fixed number of cells.\n\n\nWe have, therefore, expressed all the enzyme activities as units per\nmg DNA. \n\n \n\nFunctionally the epididymis can be distinguished into a proximal\npart consisting of caput and corpus  where the\nspermatozoa undergo a process of maturation   \nand a distal portion called the cauda which serves mainly as a storehouse of\nmature spermatozoa    .\n\n\nIn the present study the monkey epididymis was divided into four\nmajor segments    to see if the segments performing\ndifferent functions also differed in their metabolism. \n\n \n\nVas deferens has not been assigned any function in relation to\nsperm maturation.\n\n\nIt serves as a conduit and conveys epididymal sperm to the\nejaculatory duct.\n\n\nIt may also form a part of the sperm reservoir    .\n\n\nVas deferens was also included in the present studies for\ncomparison of its metabolism with that of the cauda epididymis. \n\n\n  Materials and Methods  \n\n \n\n  Animals   - -\n\n\nAdult male rhesus monkeys (  Macaca mulatta  ) , weighing 8\nto 12 kg, were from the  primate colony.\n\n\nThe animals were fed with fresh fruits and vegetables and commercial\npellet diet ( Lipton ( India) Ltd., Bombay ) .\n\n\nThe animals were maintained in air conditioned quarters (\n24<*>degrees</*> <*> plus or minus</*> 1<*>degree</*>C ) under uniform\nhusbandry conditions. \n\n \n\n  Castration and replacement therapy  - - \n\n\nThe monkeys were anaesthesised by intravenous administration of\ninterval sodium    ( May &\nBaker, Bombay, India) at a dose of 30 mg / kg body weight.\n\n\nCastration was performed in a sterile operation theatre and the\nanimals were given a post-operative treatment of 0.5 g dicrysticin  <*>\nRegistered mark</*>  ( Strepto-penicillin injection, Sarabhai\nChemicals, Baroda, India ) daily for 5 days.\n\n\nThe wound was simultaneously dressed daily with mercurochrome ( 2 %\naqueous solution) and rebasulf  <*> Registered mark</*>  powder (\nPfizer, India ) . \n\n \n\nThe castrated animals were divided into 2 groups of 6 animals\neach.\n\n\nOne group of castrated animals was maintained for 90 days, while the\nother group after 60 days received 2 mg 5a-dihydrotestosterone daily for 30\ndays.\n\n\nA group of 6 normal intact animals served as controls. \n\n \n\n Dose rationale : \n\n\nThe daily dose of 2 mg DHT was chosen from the findings of Ewing \net al  .    , who showed that testosterone\nproduction rate in adult rhesus monkeys is about 1.06 mg / day.\n\n\nIt has already been shown that release of DHT by silastic implants in\ncastrated monkeys is more effective than that of testosterone in restoring\nthe weights of accessory sex organs    .\n\n\nSince DHT was administered by injection procedure rather than by\nsustained release through silastic implant, we used DHT at twice the\nestimated production rate i.e. 2 mg / day. \n\n \n\n  Collection and storage of tissues  - - \n\n\nAt the time of autopsy, the epididymis along with the vas deferens of\nthe two sides, were carefully dissected out and immediately immersed in\nice-cold normal saline.\n\n\nThe epididymis was cleared free of fat and adhering tissues, and\ndivided into four major regions, viz. initial segment, caput, corpus and\ncauda on the basis of previous studies    and stored\nat - - 20 <*> degrees</*>C in a deep freezer after wrapping the tissues in\nparafilm  ` M'  ( American Can Co., USA ) and aluminium foil\nto prevent moisture loss.\n\n\nThe enzyme estimations were completed within 2 weeks of animal\nautopsy. \n\n \n\n  Assays  - - \n\n\nTissue samples were homogenised using Ultra Turrax ( Janke and\nKunkel, FRG ) .\n\n\nThe homogenising medium and the enzyme assays used were those\ndescribed earlier by Brooks    .\n\n\nThe assays were performed at 25 <*> degrees</*>C against blanks in\nwhich substrate was omitted in quartz cuvettes of 10 mm light path in a total\nvolume of 3 ml.\n\n\nAssays conditions were chosen to maximise enzyme activities and to\nensure zero order kinetics.\n\n\nReaction rates were always linear during the recording period and\ndirectly proportional to the amount of homogenate added.\n\n\nThe assays were run in a Pye Unicam PU 8610 recording\nspectrophotometer with thermocell attachment to ensure 25 <*> degrees</*>C\ncell temperature ( Pye Unicam Ltd., UK ) .\n\n\nResults have been expressed as units of activity per mg DNA, where\na unit is defined as 1 nanomole of substrate converted per minute at 25\n<*> degrees</*>C.\n\n\nData were analysed by  test. \n\n\n  Results  \n\n \n\n  Regional variations in epididymis  - - \n\n\nTotal protein and DNA levels showed little regional variation along\nthe epididymal duct.\n\n\nThe vas deferens also showed similar levels of protein but the\nconcentration of DNA was lower ( P<*>smaller than</*>0.001 ) as compared\nto that in epididymis ( Table 1 ) . \n\n \n\nAs we move from the proximal to the distal region of the\nepididymis, we do not find a sharp change in the activities of the glycolytic\nand HMP pathway enzymes.\n\n\nMost of the enzyme activities did not show significant differences\nbetween adjacenet segments ( Table 2 ) .\n\n\nIn general the glycolytic enzymes showed higher activity and HMP\npathway enzymes showed lower activity in the initial segment as compared to\nthe other segments of epididymis.\n\n\nHowever, as we move from cauda epididymis to vas deferens we find a\nsharp increase in the activities of all the glycolytic enzymes and a\nsignificant fall in the activities of HMP pathway enzymes.\n\n\nThe difference was statistically significant in case of most of\nthe enzymes. \n\n \n\nThe enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and aldolase of\nglycolytic pathway exhibit low maximum activities in the epididymal\nsegments as well as in the vas deferens indicating the possibility of these\nenzymes in regulating the flux through the glycolytic pathway in both\nepididymis as well as in the vas deferent. \n\n\nBoth these organs exhibit a similarity in the trend of activities of\nglycolytic enzymes.\n\n\nTriose phosphate isomerase was the most active enzyme and aldolase\nwas the least active enzyme of the pathway in the two organs. \n\n \n\n  Testicular dependence of epididymis  - - \n\n\nThree months after castration there was a marked reduction in the\nwet weights of all the epididymal segments ( control vs castrated for all\nsegments P<*>smaller than</*>0.01 ) .\n\n\nThe involution of vas deferens was however less marked ( P<0.05).\n\n\nTotal protein concentration did not show change after castration (\nTable 1 ) but its content per segment decreased significantly.\n\n\nOn the other hand DNA concentration increased significantly while its\ncontent per segment did not change markedly.\n\n\nVas deferens registered a small increase in DNA concentration after\ncastration. \n\n \n\nThe activities of all the eleven enzymes of glycolytic pathway\nand the two key enzymes of HMP pathway were reduced significantly in all the\nsegments of the epididymis after castration ( Figs 1-4 ) .\n\n\nAlthough the reduction was highly significant in case of all the\nenzymes ( <*> greater than</*>>50 % ) , the enzymes hexokinase,\nphosphofructokinase, aldolase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and\n6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase showed a massive reduction of more than\n70 % in all the epididymal segments after castration.        \n\n \n\nHowever, in the vas deferns, the reduction of enzymes after\ncastration was moderate and restricted to a few enzymes only as compared to\nepididymis ( Fig.5 ) .\n\n\nThe enzymes phosphoglycerate mutase and glucose 6-phosphate\ndehydrogenase were however reduced significantly ( P<*>smaller than</*>0.001 )\nafter castration. \n\n \n\n  Androgenic stimulation of epididymis  - -\n\n\nReplacement therapy by exogenous DHT in castrated monkeys\nresulted in an approximately 50 % increase in the wet weight of epididymis.\n\n\nThe increase in wet weight of individual segments was statistically\nsignificant in initial segment ( P<*>smaller than</*>0.05 ) , caput (\nP<*>smaller than</*>0.001 ) and corpus ( P<*>smaller than</*>0.01 ) .\n\n\nVas deferens registered a 23 % increase in its wet weight which was\nstatistically nonsignificant.\n\n\nTotal protein concentration did not change significantly after DHT\nreplacement in either the epididymal segments or the vas deferens.\n\n\nHowever, DNA concentration decreased significantly in the\nepididymal segments and moderately in vas deferens.\n\n\nThe enzyme activities were stimulated significantly after androgen\ntreatment in the epididymal segments, but the response of the four sements\nwas not similar.\n\n\nInitial segment showed maximum stimulation of most of the enzyme\nactivities.\n\n\nThe response of caput and corpus region was more or less similar.\n\n\nHowever, in the cauda region the stimulation of enzyme activities\nafter DHT replacement was less marked as compared to the three proximal\nsegments.\n\n\nIn the vas deferens the ensymes hexokinase, phosphoglycerate\nkinase, phosphoglycerate mutase of glycolytic pathway and glucose\n6-phosphate dehydrogenase of HMP pathway were the only enzymes which showed\nsome significant stimulation. \n\n\n  Discussion  \n\n \n\nThe results obtained in the present study indicate that the\ndifferent segments of the epididymis which have been assigned distinct\nfunctions do not differ significantly from each other in their energy\nmetabolism.\n\n\nHowever, vas deferens differs markedly from the epididymis in the\nactivities of glycolytic and HMP pathway enzymes.\n\n\nIn general vas deferens showed a much larger glycolytic potential\nbut relatively lower pentose phosphate cycle activity as compared to the\nepididymis.\n\n\nThis may indicate a higher dependence of vas deferens on\ncarbohydrates for its energy requirements and a lower synthetic\nactivity in this part of the excurrent duct as compared to epididymis. \n\n \n\nThe results suggest that a decrease in wet weight of the\nepididymis in the androgen deficient state is \nalways accompanied by a simultaneous increase in DNA concentration and the\nopposite effect is seen on replacement with exogenous androgen.\n\n\nOn the other hand, total protein concentration of epididymis\nremains fairly constant in the different androgenic states of the animal.\n\n\nThis indicates that changes in epididymal wet weight are not\naccompanied by marked alterations in cell population of the epididymis.\n\n\nPrevious studies in rat have shown that androgens have little\ninfluence on either mitotic activity or DNA synthesis in the epididymis of\nadult castrated    and intact    animals.\n\n\nHowever, total protein in epididymis appears to be a function of wet\nweight and is changed in proportion to the changes in wet weight of the\ntissue, and therefore, maintains its concentration constant. \n\n \n\nA significant decrease in the specific activities of all the\nglycolytic and the two key enzymes of HMP pathway after castration indicate\nthat the synthesis and/or turnover of all these enyzmes is testicular\ndependent in the epididymal cells.\n\n\nHowever, it appears that the regulatory enzymes of glycolytic\npath way ( hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and aldolase) and HMP pathway (\nglucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase)\nare affected more severely after castration as compared to the non-regulatory\nenzymes. \n\n \n\nThe exocrine secretions of the testis ( which includes\nspermatozoa, androgen, proteins and other products ) reach the epididymis via\nits efferent ducts whereas the endocrine secretions of testis reach\nepididymis essentially via the systemic circulation.\n\n\nThe replacement of the endocrine secretions of the testis in\ncastrated monkeys by exogenous DHT stimulated the activities of most of\nthe enzymes in the epididymal segments.\n\n\nHowever, none of the enzymes could reach its control level\nindicating that either the peripheral androgens alone cannot restore the\nnormal functioning of the epididymis or it is due to any of the other reasons\n( see below).\n\n\nThe regulatory enzymes showed greater stimulation indicating their\ngreater dependence on testicular endocrine secretion. \n\n \n\nFunctionally, epdidymis has been distinguished into two major\nregions, a proximal region ( consist ing of initial segment, caput and\ncorpus) where spermatozoa undergo maturation and a distal region or cauda\nwhere mature sperms are stored in a metabolically quiescent state \n  .\n\n\nPost-testicular maturation of sperm begins in the initial segment\nand is completed by the time the spermatozoa reach the distal corpus region\n   .\n\n\nOn the other hand sperm storage is a distinct physiological\nentity and the sperm store ( cauda ) might be functionally quite separate\nfrom other parts of the epidiymal duct    .\n\n\nThe results of the present study indicate that cauda does not differ\ngreatly from the proximal segments in the acivities of the enzymes of energy\nmetabolism but it is quite distinct from other segments in the androgenic\nregulation of these enzymes.\n\n\nWhile initial segment, caput and corpus showed good response to\nexogenous androgen treatment in castrated animals the cauda showed only a\nmoderate response to such treatment. \n\n \n\nPoor response of cauda to androgen supplementation in\ncastrated animals may be due to a higher androgen threshold of this region as\ncompared to other regions of epididymis    .\n\n\nIn a study carried out in rat epididymis, it has been shown that the\ntime taken for the specific activity of cytosolic enzymes to reach a new\nsteady state after removal or supplementation of androgens was variable,\ndepending on the enzyme and the region of epidiymis  \n .\n\n\nIt is probable that in monkey epididymis the carbohydrate\nmetabolising enzymes require a longer time to reach new steady state in the\ncauda after androgen supplementation and perhaps longer periods of treatment\nor commencement of replacement therapy immediately after castration might\nhave stimulated the enzyme activities in this region better as seen in\nother segments, or a higher dose of DHT could have induced a better response.\n\n\nIt is also pertinent to note that microquantites of estrogen\nsynergise with androgens in stimulating the acivites of the enzymes of\nenergy metabolism in rhesus monkey epididymis    .\n\n\nThus, replacement with DHT alone may not be physiological enough to\nrestore epididymal metabolism. \n\n \n\nA comparison androgenic regulation of energy metabolism in the\nvas deferens with that in the epididymis indicates that castration and\nandrogen supplementation in castrated animals affected glycolysis and\nHMP pathway moderately in the vas defer<l.ens.\n\n\nThis may indicate that the vas deferens is quite distinct from the\nepididymis in the regulation of its energy metabolism by endocrine secretions\nof testis. \n\n \n\nIt is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that the four segments\nof the epididymis differ significantly from the vas deferens in the acivities\nand endocrine regulation of glycolytic and HMP pathway enzymes.\n\n\nHowever, the four segments do not differ significantly from each\nother in the activities of these enzymes either in normal ( control) or in\ncastrated animals.\n\n\nBut the stimulation of these enzymes by treatment with exogenous\nandrogens in castrated animals was maximum in the initial segment and\ngradually decreased from caput to cauda region of epididymis. \n\n \n\nThis study indicates a strict dependence of epididymal energy\nmetabolism on testicular androgens. \n\n\nMany epididymal functions which require energy ( e.g. absorption and\nsecretion ) are important for sperm maturation in this organ.\n\n\nThe androgen dependence of sperm maturation may partly be due to\nthe androgen dependence of epididymal energy metabolism. \n\n\n  Acknoledgement  \n\n \n\nThe authors are thankful to Dr. B.N.

{"text": "<*> dotted line</*> AND  DHARMA  SHALL COME\n      \n\n \n\n WHEN Patrica Gonzales, 36,\nwrites her address in a  diary, she uses one more line than\nshe strictly needs to.\n\n\nBelow her zip-code number, she invariably adds the words: \n  \" Om Mani Padma Hum   .\" \n\n\nFor Gonzales, a resident of Mexico City, is a  \" Boodist\"\n who has been reciting this  mantra  for the past five\nyears. \n\n \n\nIndeed,   \" Om Mani Padma Hum \"\n  is no longer the preserve of mist-clad monasteries and\ngeneration-old Buddhists.\n\n\nFor, in these days of try-and-buy religion, this sonorous chant wafts\nout of California condos and Bombay buildings.\n\n\nIt graces business cards in Seattle and provides an inexhaustible\ntopic for religious discussion in Syndey. \n\n \n\nFor slowly, almost imperceptibly, in the last few decades,\nBuddhism, once a strictly oriental religion, has captured hearts and minds in\ndistant lands.\n\n\nAnd it is not  clouds of incense, flickering\nbutter lamps and gorgeous red-and-gold images that entrance this new breed of\nfollowers, but the 2,500-year-old philosophy of a man who, followers believe,\npeered into the heart of the universe. \n\n \n\nSiddhartha was born around 563 BC.\n\n\nHis father was a monarch who went to enormous lengths to shield his\nsensitive son from the unpleasant aspects of life.\n\n\nBut when Siddhartha was 29, during his first few ventures outside the\npalace grounds, he encountered suffering, sickness and death. \n\n \n\nAfter days of turmoil, Siddhartha left the palace in search of\nanswers to the questions that haunted him.\n\n\nYears of wandering and introspection led him to Gaya, where he sat\nunder a   peepal   tree and went into a trance.\n\n\nHe emerged from his meditation a Buddha, or an Awakened One. \n\n \n\nDuring his moment of realisation, Siddhartha understood that\nthe self is an illusion and that all is impermanent.\n\n\nHe outlined the Four Truths; that misery exists, that misery\noriginates from within us, that this can be eliminated, and that this\nelimination is the result of a methodical path that must be followed. \n\n \n\nThe Buddha prescribed the Eightfold Path, consisting of basic\nrules like right thinking, right speech and right living, which would help\nthe individual to escape from the cycle of life and death and to attain\nnirvana. \n\n \n\nWhile about 200 million people in Asia, mainly Thailand, Japan,\nSri Lanka, Tibet, Burma and Vietnam, are Buddhist by tradition, a large\nnumber of people from other religious backgrounds are becoming Buddhist,\nor at least adopting some aspects of the religion. \n\n \n\nIn Hollywood, Buddhism has displaced environmental\nconsciousness as the fad of the moment and the Dalai Lama has been elevated\nto the status of a pop icon.\n\n\nWhile actor Richard Gere has reportedly donated over a million\ndollars to the exiled Tibetan leader, other big names like Harrison Ford,\nShirley MacLaine, Jane Fonda and Meg Ryan are also among the famous and the\nfaithful Bernardo Bertolucci, whose film,  The Little Buddha  ,\nwas released last month, says that his foray into the religion has changed\nhim.\n\n\n \" I have come to realise what a great religion Buddhism is,\"\n says the maker of the film, which interweaves the story of\nSiddhartha with the search of  lamas  from Bhutan for a\nreincarnation of a great teacher. \n\n \n\nWhile American interest in Buddhism is relatively new, 19th\ncentury British scholars like Christmas Humphreys and I B Horner started\nsocieties like the Pali Text Society and the Buddhist Society about 70\nyears ago.\n\n\n \" These groups were purely academic in nature,\"  says\nR Sirkar, chairman of the United Lodge of Theosophists.\n\n\n \" But gradually the interest became more religious and\nother groups began to appear which accepted Buddhism as a way of life.\n\n\nThis is probably related to the crisis in Christianity in the\nWest.\" \n\n\nThe 26-year-old Western Buddhist Order started by Sangarakshita, a\nBritish monk, is a perfect example.\n\n\nThe organisation, one among about 30 similar groups in the UK, has\n600 members, many of whom live in single-sex communities.\n\n\nRegular classes are conducted both on the teachings of Buddhism and\non meditation.\n\n\nThe  magazine,  \" The Golden Drum\n\"  , keeps members up to date about monasteries being\nconstructed in Queensland and retreats being built on Scottish islands.\n\n\n \n\nMost members wandered into the order for a dollop of yoga and\nmeditation and stayed for spirItual seconds.\n\n\nAnd while many of the  early members were long-haired\nhippies who might just as easily have drifted into the portals of a\nScientology church or a Moonies temple, the newer followers are clean-cut\nprofessionals with an educated interest in Buddhism. \n\n \n\nThe growing awareness of Buddhism has, to a great extent, been\ncreated by the sudden presence of Tibetan monks in diverse parts of the\nworld.\n\n\nIn 1959, over 1,00,000 Tibetans fled their homeland, which had\nbeen annexed by the Chinese.\n\n\nWhile most Tibetans settled in India, some went to parts of Europe\nand America.\n\n\nConcerned about the survival of their culture, they began to build\nmonasteries and libraries.\n\n\nAnd in order to fund themselves, they began to conduct meditation\nand yoga classes. \n\n \n\nIndeed, Tibetan and other Buddhist groups are mushrooming around\nthe world.\n\n\nAnd even if their teachings contradict each  ,\ntheir followers don't really care.\n\n\n \" There are thousands of paths to the truth,\"  says\nRev Prof Kohilavatta Anandathera of the Bahujan Vihar Trust in Bombay.\n\n\n \" Each must find his own.\"  \n\n \n\nIt is this acceptance of individual beliefs and tolerance towards\ndifferent, even contradictory, opinions that seems to attract the rational\nseekers of religion.\n\n\n \" I was born a Christian but when I read about Buddhism, I\nfound it very appealing,\"  says Dhammachari Lokamitra, a\nPune-based member of the Western Buddhist Order.\n\n\n \" I liked tolerance and the fact that there is no greater\nGod in Buddhism.\n\n\nBuddha is not God, but an enlightened man.\n\n\nHe only shows us the way.\n\n\nWe too can attain  nirvana  if we follow his path.\n\n\nBuddhism does not demand blind belief.\n\n\nIt encourages you to question and investigate.\n\n\nMore than any other religion, I feel it meets the needs of the modern\nman.\"  \n\n \n\n \" I feel Buddhism has the most practical approach to\nlife,\"  agrees Babloo Sen, the director of a Bombay school, who\nmeditates regularly with a group of friends.\n\n\n \" In a way Buddhism is similar to courses like EST and Silva\nMind Control which believe that you have the power to make anything\nhappen.\n\n\nThese courses, however, try to change attitudes without\nspirituality and so their impact is limited.\n\n\nBy following the techniques of Buddhism, you can control your\nmind, transform your thoughts, change your attitude, and so improve your\n  karma   .\n\n\nThere is no mumbo jumbo about sin and superstition.\n\n\nJust straight psychological facts.\n\n\nUndoubtedly this is the religion of today.\"  \n\n \n\nWhile Sen still calls herself a Hindu, her friend and\nmeditation-mate Behroze Khajotia, who was born a Zoroastrian, admits that she\nconsiders herself a Buddhist. \n\n \n\n \" When I started reading about Buddhlism and doing\nyoga in 1991, I didn't know what I was in for,\"  says Khajotia, a\nresearcher at TOMCO, who became interested in the religion when her\ncousin, who has studied under many of the great Buddhist teachers, started\nconducting meditation classes in Bombay.\n\n\n \" I was a practising Parsi.\n\n\nI said my prayers and did everything a good Parsi girl should.\n\n\nBut the more I read about Buddhism, the more involved I became.\n\n\nI was very drawn by the openness and tolerance of the religion.\n\n\nBuddhism challenges us to question the validity of our beliefs and\nassumptions.\n\n\nIt has certainly made a huge difference in my life.\"  \n\n \n\nWhile Khajotia says that her new-found beliefs have helped\nher to snap out of her habitual depression.\n\n\nSen says that Buddhism has made her more humble and considerate.\n\n\n \" It has turned my life upside down.\"  she says.\n\n\n \" For example, I used to be an avid TV and movie watcher.\n\n\nI couldn't sleep unless I watched a movie every night.\n\n\nAnd then suddenly, one day, I was not interested in movies\nanymore.\n\n\nI felt I had many more important things to do - - books to read,\npeople to talk to.\n\n\nReally, it was most peculiar.\"  \n\n \n\nSen and Khajotia are part of a group of middle-class Bombayites\nwho have consciously adopted a Buddhist teacher and a philosophy.\n\n\nAnd like them numerous groups of middle-class Indians,\nespecially in Bangalore and Delhi, are rediscovering the religion that was\nborn here so long ago. \n\n \n\nIndeed, while the West is still flirting with Buddhism, in India\nthe religion has seen violent fluctuations.\n\n\nWhile practically the state religion of the Mauryan and Kushan\ndynasties, Buddhism vanished from India by the 12th century.\n\n\nThis was probably a consequence of the destruction of the great\nuniversities, like Nalanda and Takshashila, and the massacre of monks by\ninvaders. \n\n \n\nThere were few Buddhists in the country till Dr Babasaheb\nAmbedkar, disillusioned by the Hindu caste system, called on the\noppressed lower castes to unite under the rather more egalitarian Buddhism.\n\n\nAmbedkar, along with 2,00,000 followers, converted in 1956.\n\n\nAnd although many view this as a social rather than a religious\nstatement.\n\n\nAnandathera, who works with  Ambedkarites, is\noptimistic. \n\n \n\n \" It is difficult to change your spiritual outlook\nsuddenly,\"  says the monk who left his home in Sri Lanka 33 years\nago.\n\n\n \" But in many ways they are better Budhists than we are.\n\n\nThey are not so caught up in rituals and ceremonies.\"  \n\n \n\nIndeed, for believers, this sudden movement towards Buddhism, in\nIndia and around the world, is no fad but the realisation of the long\nforetold prophecy of  Shri  Padmasambhava, who introduced\nBuddhism to Tibet.\n\n\n \" When iron birds fly and horses run on wheel,\"  the\neighth century saint said,  \" the Tibetan people will be scattered\nlike ants across the face of the earth and  dharma  shall come\nto the land of the red man.\"   <*> two red & black diomonds</*>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3b11b4ed-0063-4acb-8d0e-73e2b9619638", "added":

where each day became a dazzling game of hare and\nhounds.\n\n\nOnly Jason never really knew when he was the hound and when he was\nthe hunted.\n\n\nM as she called herself, was everything she promised and more.\n\n\nDesigns poured out of her mind like cotton off the bobbin.\n\n\nHer store of ideas was seemingly inexhaustible. \n\n \n\n \" She thinks she owns the place,\"  grumbled\nBernard but Jason ignored      him.\n\n\nBernard was old and though he had started Jason off with his designs\nwhen Jason Enterprises first set up shop, he was definitely a fuddy duddy.\n\n\n \" I don't trust her, Jason,\"  he said,  \"  too good.\n\n\nWhy should she work for you?\n\n\nShe can manage quite well on her own - - and wipe you out.\" \n\n\nBernard was obviously a jealous old woman. \n\n \n\nLike Theresa - - his wife.\n\n\nTheresa was turning into quite an old woman herself.\n\n\nSuddenly Jason noticed the lines that ran in downward curves on\neither side of her mouth.\n\n\nA mouth that he had once likened to a rose.\n\n\nBut that was before he met M; years before.\n\n\nSuddenly he could not help notice the glint of steel in her hair - -\nit seemed to emanate from the steel in her heart, in her voice, it had an\nedge to it that cut into his patience, especially in the mornings. \n\n \n\n \" I don't know if  really work that keeps\nyou out so late,\"   say.\n\n\nOr:  \" Why don't you let me try out one of those great\ncreations you keep raving about?\"  such was the burden of  song these days.\n\n\nAnd Jason wondered how he had ever thought her voice musical; her\ncompany prized. \n\n \n\nYet, she had been a good wife to him.\n\n\nHe conceded that.\n\n\nAfter all he was a just man, even if a bit under  spell.\n\n\nTheresa had not only left home and country to settle in a strange\nland with him, but had given him her everything - - her \nwealth which she had smuggled out with her, wrapped in her lingerie; wealth\nwhich he had quickly converted into the empire that he now ruled under his\nname - - Jason Enterprises.\n\n\nAll he had had was his knowledge - - no one knew better to spin and\nweave and dye what he spun and wove and dyed into a hundred brilliant hues.\n\n\nAll of it would have been naught if Theresa had not given him the\nwherewithal to put it to work. \n\n \n\nYet she has, the roughness of sandpaper about her now, he\nthought, as he buttered his toast, scraping the knife against the brown toast\nto drown the cutting edge out of her voice. \n\n \n\nM, on the other hand, continued to fascinate.\n\n\nTo glitter like a jewel in the sand, tantalizingly out of reach, yet\nalways just at hand.\n\n\nHe knew he had only to reach out to grasp and the sands would close\nover the gem and hide it from view.\n\n\nYet she was perfect.\n\n\nDespite Bernard.\n\n\nShe toiled diligently day in and out - - drawing design after winning\ndesign, drawing Jason closer into her net, till he could hardly breathe for\nthe pain and the ecstasy of being near her. \n\n \n\n \"  have an exhibition,\"  she\nannounced and once again the sheaf of drawings fanned out before him, almost\nby themselves.\n\n\n \" We'll have a    sell-out show.\n\n\nAnd wipe everyone else out.\"  \n\n \n\nHe wondered at the glint in her eyes.\n\n\n warnings, he thought; then laughed at himself.\n\n\nBernard was an old, old woman.\n\n\nShe was the perfect employee.\n\n\nLoyal to a fault.\n\n\nHe knew that.\n\n\nIf only he could get her to forget her role; stop being only a\ndesigner <*> dotted line</*> \n\n \n\nM did exactly that.\n\n\nShe moved off from the drawing boards and stormed the tailoring\nrooms, taking charge effortlessly.\n\n\nJason watched indulgently as she whipped lazy fingers into magical\ngymnastics with the needle, as she guided the master tailors to turn their\ntheories inside out and make their scissors chase the lines of her incredible\nsketches.\n\n\nThe grumbling turned to mummers of admiration; turning dissent to\napproval, as each miraculous creation made a mannequin look like Galatea come\nalive.\n\n\nEven Bernard was convinced.\n\n\nHe had been wrong. \n\n \n\n life took a turn around again.\n\n\nThe merry-go-round he had found himself on the time M first breezed\ninto his room now whirled more fiercely than ever.\n\n\nA strange sunshine flooded his being - - well-being, confidence.\n\n\nIn a week he would win over his competitors; in a month \ntake over their business; and then he knew it in his blood as surely as on\nthat first, fateful day - -  get M too.\n\n\nOr  get him more likely.\n\n\nFor he knew now that she was reaching at him through the haze of many\nhued chiffons and textured silks.\n\n\nHe was the golden prize she was after.\n\n\nAnd  get him.\n\n\nOr he her.\n\n\nHe felt dizzy with elation.  <*> star</*> <*> star</*> <*>\nstar</*>\n\n \n\nEven Theresa was suddenly looking more desirable.\n\n\nWith success at hand, Jason began to feel mellow.\n\n\nThe old girl wasn't so bad after all.\n\n\nHe was just being a husband seeing faults in her all the time.\n\n\nAfter all she had done for him.\n\n\nAnd besides he needed her around.\n\n\nHe knew that even when her voice acquired that cutting edge, even\nwhen the steel in her hair blinded his eyes to the past.\n\n\nThe day Theresa went - - everything would pack up and crumble.\n\n\nHers was the will that held his empire up - - hers the power that\nkept the moneylines pumping.\n\n\nLong years ago, in a foolish lovesick moment he had signed a pact.\n\n\nLife without Theresa was worth nothing - -  <O>\nbelow the drawing a box in which tantalizer 2 <O> she had given him her\neverything he had felt compelled to make as grand a gesture towards her.\n\n\nTo show his overwhelming love, and to shake off some of the burden\nof gratitude.\n\n\nThe day Theresa left him, or died, or turned to stone as neglected\nwives are wont to do the day their great partnership dissolved - - though of\ncourse, the day would never come, so great was their love - - his empire\nwould crumble.\n\n\nHe had willed it, and sworn it all the same.\n\n\nThey had sealed the pact before the powers that be, and signed it in\nblood.\n\n\nTheir blood mingled in a saucer of mother of pearl, and used as ink.\n\n\nHer fingernail the pen.\n\n\nAnd in return, destiny had vowed them eternal bliss.\n\n\nThe bliss of togetherness. \n\n \n\nFool!\n\n\nHis voice startled him - - but his mind continued to curse and rave.\n\n\nHow could he not know that the softness would turn mouldy, that the\ngold would turn to steel.\n\n\nYet, she wasn't so bad after all.\n\n\nAfter all, he was not quite Don Juan himself.\n\n\nEven when he held his breath and tightened his stomach; darkened his\nhair. \n\n \n\nHe would pamper Theresa.\n\n\nMake up to her.\n\n\nMake the old magic work again.\n\n\nSo he would feel no betrayal when he finally got M. \n\n \n\nM - - that was destined to be.\n\n\nHe had known her in past lives - - or past eons - - and the meteor\nhad blazed across his firmament again, and they were bound to clash.\n\n\nM was destiny.\n\n\nSo was Theresa.\n\n\nOne more precious than the other.\n\n\nFor if M fed his empire and fattened it; Theresa kept it alive.\n\n\nHer life blood pulsed in its veins; her heartbeat throbbed in it.\n <*> star</*> <*> star</*> <*> star</*>\n\n \n\nThe day of the exhibition the town went wild.\n\n\nWomen queued up outside his doors hours before dawn, waiting for the\nevent to begin.\n\n\nJason Enterprises was a beehive.\n\n\nFingers flew like spindles making miracles happen.\n\n\nLast minute arrangements made the place a fairyland.\n\n\nM was everywhere, singing now, in a sweet, high-pitched voice, words\nno one could understand.\n\n\nBut her spirit was contagious and how they had worked all night to\nget the place ready. \n\n \n\nWomen oohed and aahed; and an old dowager fainted right away at\nthe sheer beauty of the clothes.\n\n\nM had vetoed models - - she had set up the mannequins instead,\ndressing them to the last detail, till they stood startlingly lifelike and\nwondrously beautiful, clad in her creations. \n\n \n\nWithin the first hour half the dresses had  ` Sold'\n tags on them; by the second hour the doors had to be closed to\nprevent a stampede.\n\n\nPeople would be let in in batches; the store would remain open till\nmidnight. \n\n \n\nBulbs flashed, the photographers went crazy.\n\n\nOrder books filled with  meticulously\ncrabbed writing as Bernard pushed his fingers past their pain threshold.\n\n\nInch tapes broke with overuse, and a great trunk full of spools had\nto be emptied to accommodate the money that came in as advance cash. \n\n \n\nM was rosy cheeked with excitement.\n\n\nJason bit his lip, stopping the moan that rose to his mouth - - she\nhad never looked more desirable.\n\n\nHe moved towards her - - it would be easy now, at this moment when\nshe was flushed with success but his step faltered.\n\n\nHis eye glazed, then focused on the face he knew, alas so well. \n\n \n\nTheresa stood barely a step away, rapt in admiration of a gold\nchiffon dress.\n\n\nShe had not seen him.\n\n\nOr even M for the matter. \n\n \n\n \" Mrs. Jason.\"  M moved like satin to grasp  surprised hand.\n\n\nJason tasted blood on his bitten lip.\n\n\nHis worlds had clashed, and he felt the impact almost tangibly.\n\n\nHe could not hear much of what the two women said and he did not\nwant to.\n\n\nHis mind was busy seeking another strategy.\n\n\nSomething that would wipe out this setback.\n\n\nGet him closer to M again. \n\n \n\nHe turned compelled - - to catch M giving him a radiant smile -\n- her eyes alight and ripe with promise. \n\n \n\n \"  Mr. Jason,\"  she said, and\nTheresa fluttered up to him looking soft and radiant, her eyes shining, her\nhair flecked with long forgotten gold, her mouth a tempting rose bud.\n\n\n \" What a beautiful surprise,\"  she said.\n\n\n \"  a darling.\" \n\n\nAnd there to his surprise, Theresa threw her arms around him and\nhugged him tight. \n\n \n\nIf he showed his surprise, Theresa did not notice it.\n\n\nShe was looking at M again.\n\n\nM, who held in her hand a dress in blue and gold. \n\n \n\nIt seemed to Jason that he had never seen a dress such as this -\n- and he had inspected every one in the store.\n\n\nIt was an evening gown, cut in a bridal fullness - - the soft\ngossamer folds gathered at the neck, and gently at the waist to fall away in\nswirls of sheer poetry.\n\n\nIt seemed as if a spider has spun the yarn out of the sunshine for\nit - - and the sky had shredded itself to contribute to the blue stars that\nshone in the background.\n\n\nJason felt he could hear angels singing. \n\n \n\n \"  beautiful.\" \n\n\n voice seemed far away - - and he jolted back to\nreality.\n\n\n \" Both of you, thank you.\n\n\nJason I don't know what to say <*> dotted line</*> what a lovely\nsurpirse <*> dotted line</*>\" \n\n\nThen, womanly common sense took hold.\n\n\n \" Do you think it will fit?\"    \n\n \n\n \" Perfectly.\n\n\nThis is a secret magical design,\"  M explained, as if to a\nchild.\n\n\nTheresa, after all, knew nothing of her powers.\n\n\nJason she knew hadn't told her; wasn't quite sure of them himself.\n\n\n \" The design is made to fit anyone - - perfectly.\n\n\nAnd this, I have created, especially for you.\"  \n\n \n\nThe crowds froze, tranfixed by the dress as M held it up, and it\ncaught the light - - and bounced it off, caught the light and swallowed it,\nthen bounced it back again.\n\n\nThe room seemed to grow dark in comparison.\n\n\nThe gold seemed to be the light of a million fireflies. \n\n \n\n \" Can I try it on?\"  asked Theresa, her voice a\n voice asking to taste her birthday cake. \n\n \n\nJason found his voice.\n\n\nTurning chaos into triumph, he smiled his old world,\nwe-are-one-of-a-kind smile at Theresa, and glowed a little as she spilled her\nwonderment all over him. \n\n \n\nAnd then she was gone - - dress floating behind her, held aloft\nby M, who meek as a handmaiden, followed behind. \n\n \n\nJason swelled with pride.\n\n\nHe chose his women well.\n\n\nThe best or perhaps the best women chose him.\n\n\nIt did not matter.\n\n\nWhen Theresa came out, wearing that dream of a dress, designed by\nthe dream he hoped to turn to reality, the world would stop and gasp. \n\n \n\n \" JASON!\" \n\n\nThe voice cut through the room like a shard of ice, but it was the\nfire that caused it that transfixed Jason.\n\n\nThe dressing room was in a blaze - - the very room Theresa had\nentered with M following close behind. \n\n \n\nFor one horrible moment Jason saw it clearly.\n\n\nHis destiny.\n\n\nThe dress going up in flames and devouring Theresa, till only ashes\nremained.\n\n\nAshes and the dull sparkle of revenge.\n\n\nM laughing.\n\n\nM <*> dotted line</*> he had it now - - why the voice had rung a\nbell in his memory.\n\n\nEven the songs she sang were clear to him.\n\n\nM.\n\n\nMedia, of another life.\n\n\nMedea, the woman he had loved and abandoned in a life lived long\nago.\n\n\nTheresa, the woman he was abandoning now.\n\n\nMedea, who many eons ago, in another, far off, long forgotten birth\nhad given her  wealth, the golden fleece, to him - - Jason,\nthe Argonaut.\n\n\nDestiny mocked - - and he could hear.\n\n\n laughter as she shrieked in agony, caught by the very\nfire that had torched his wife.\n\n\nThe shop emptied in seconds. \n\n \n\nThe short circuit that turned  new dress into\na torch had burned her to nothing; and M had died horribly, cut off by  blazing body from the dressing room door. \n\n \n\nJason, master of Jason Enterprises, looked back over his lives -\n- and into his future ones. \n\n \n\nKnowing no escape, he wept.    <*> square</*> <*> square</*>\n\n \n\nM, on the other hand, continued to fascinate.\n\n\nTo glitter like a jewel in the sand, tantalizingly iout of reach,\nyet always just at hand  <*> square</*> <*> square</*>  <*> square</*> <*> square</*>\n\n \n\nM was everywhere, singing now, in a sweet, high-pitched voice,\nwords no one could understand  <*> square</*> <*> square</*>  <*> square</*> <*> square</*>\n\n \n\nM.

{"text": "Woman has been on the  one  side.\n\n\nShe is known as \" Queen of the house. \"\n\n\nAnd on the other side she is getting rude type of behaviour from\neveryone.\n\n\nDue to the invasions of the many invaders protection of the woman was\nin  danger.\n\n\nSo she was kept in the house only. \n\n \n\nIn India woman is  inferior     than   men from each point of view.\n\n\nSo  she does not get  that much  respect as she thinks.\n\n\nDuring the last century the status of woman was not very much  .\n\n\nShe was denied  many   \nactivities.  \n\n\nShe was denied  Education, widow marriage & etc.\n\n\nShe also faced    problems   of dowry\n and  many things like beating, burning, mental  \n torture   & etc.\n\n\nIn the last century she was not permitted to take part in any social\nactivity.\n\n\nShe also  was denied  what is called\n\" self-wealth \" .\n\n\nAnd because of caste system her status also become very much low.\n\n\n   Once   she    becomes   widow she was not permitted to remarriage.\n\n\nShe was made to    sit   in the house \n  compulsorily   in the dark room.\n\n\nIf she did not    give   \nbirth to son she was severly    criticized  \nfrom each    point of view.  \n\n\nThere were many    cases   during this\nperiod of  Sati  .  \n\n \n\n \n\nStatus of the woman was not of that much respect as compared \nto men  .\n\n\nBut her status increased during recent period.\n\n\nNumber of factors were involved to raise the factors of her status.\n\n\n \n\nDuring British period there were many  social\nreformers who increased the status of women.\n\n\nRaja Ram Mohan Roy    criticized   the\nact of  sati  .\n\n\nSo Britishers passed the law of abolition of  sati  .\n\n\n Arya Samajists  &  Brahmo Samajists \n   protested   against and did well to    achieve   the status of women.\n\n\nThey   abolition of\n sati  act,  introduce  education of women & etc.\n\n\nMahatama Phule & Savitribai Phule started the first ever school in\nIndia for girls.\n\n\nAnd did many things  for women.\n\n\nThere were also many social reformers like Agarkar, Gandhi, Tilak,\nKarve & etc. \n\n \n\nAfter Independence Government passed many laws like \"\nDowry system Act, \" \"  Sati  Abolition Act\n\" & many more.\n\n\nThey gave free education  to   \nmany   of the women.\n\n\nThey passed law for the defence of       wealth.\n\n\nMany societies & social groups were formed to take  care\nof women\n\n\nAnd see to it that she is  in  no danger.\n\n\nAnd to solve the problems of women.\n\n\nUN declared the decade 1975-85  as  \n    decade. \n\n \n\nThese reforms were made but the social status of the\nwomen have not that much increased.\n\n\nThere was abolition of  sati  practices but there are\n even  now the cases of  sati  .\n\n\nThe women are not treated well by    their \n husbands because of not bringing dowry.\n\n\nThere are many    cases   of dowry\nsystem.\n\n\n Now also she is not given the superior\nposition.\n\n\nShe is treated as inferior.\n\n\nPercent of Illiteracy is  high   \namong   them.\n\n\n In  society  has been   \ncriticized   .\n\n\nThere are many    cases   of rape on\nher.\n\n\nShe is under the control of her husband, father & the\nsons.\n\n\n If women    get \n divorce then she does not have any protection from anybody.\n\n\nParents throw her away because she has left her \nhouse.   \n\n\n\n \n\nThe term \" maturity \" is of  importance in the life.\n\n\nThe person is said to be matured when he / she gets knowledge and can\ndistinguish between the values of good & bad & also when he gets    physically    well\ndeveloped. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics of Mature person are as follows\n\n\n1) He is    well   enough to take the\ndecision    about   himself without any\nguidance or help.\n\n\n2)  He is    mentally \n good and behaviour in that order which society behaves.\n\n\n3) He can distinguish between good & bad things of the life.\n\n\n4)  He is capable and is accepting any type of\nresponsibility he has  been  given.\n\n\nHe is not running away from it.\n\n\nHe is able to take any type of situation that comes in way of his\nlife like they are  sad  or good.\n\n\n5) He is given number of decision by various persons,\nsocial groups & many other elements.\n\n\nBut finally he has to make choice.\n\n\nHe does it & attains.\n\n\n6) He is also the person who can set goals of life\naccording to his abilities & limitations.\n\n\nHe does not have any    one    to  select proper goals and strives to attain    them.  \n\n\n7) He is mentally & physically well developed.  \n\n\n Factors leading to Maladjustment of person are as  follows \n\n \n\n1) If the person is    socially  \nhated or refused by many persons like friends, parents & etc., then he\ndevelops    inferiority   complex in him\nand it    leads   to maladjustment.\n\n\n2)  In family if there is fightings \namongst parents  and often  they say of\nthe participation between, or  saying  I will kill\nyou,  or there is often saying of    divorce\n \n\n\nThese    develop   stress in the\nperson and it    leads   to maladjustment.\n\n\n3) Many parents do not    think   the\ncapability of    their   children and loads  heavy goals on them which are  out of    their   hands.\n\n\nWhen person is not able to attain goals or if he sees many times\nfailure in his life then it    leads   to\nmaladjustment.\n\n\n4) There is often difference  in the\nelders  of what they say &   \nhow   they act.\n\n\nThey  say something and act on some thing  else  .\n\n\nSo person cannot take the proper value.\n\n\nAnd this leads to maladjustment.\n\n\n5) Many parents    think   that their\n    children   are\nextraordinary and different from every body else but  this is\nnot true.\n\n\nChild becomes because of the selfish cruel, selfbased &\netc.\n\n\nAnd this leads to maladjustment.\n\n\n6) Many parents do not know  how to\ncommunicate with    their   children.\n\n\nThere is poor type of    communication\n  between them.\n\n\nAnd parents cannot communicate.\n\n\nThey become very rude sometimes or soft  at  times.\n\n\nThis leads to maladjustments.\n\n\n7) In many cases when children do not do anything    what   parents say then father becomes\nextra  hard & mother becomes extra soft.\n\n\nThis leads to maladjustment.\n\n\n8) If the social    status   of his\nfamily is not good enough means that their  parents status\nis not respected in society  then the person becomes tense &\nthis leads to maladjustment.  \n\n \n\n \n\nIndia is vast    country   .\n\n\nIt is like continent \n\n\nIndia is surrounded by huge mountains in north & by sea water in\nall the three directions.\n\n\n It is    isolated \n    in   some what respect.\n\n\nSo because of this it is said that India has preserved its unity.\n\n\nIndia is  a  vast country.\n\n\nIt has many peoples who speak many different languages,\nthey are  of many different religions like Hindu, Muslim,\nParsi, Jains & many    others.  \n\n\nMany of the people have come from distant country to India and \n  have   settled here and had got in to the culture of\nIndia.\n\n\nThey are  so involved in India that they do not\n   think   they are  not part of\nthis country, religion, caste & etc.\n\n\n<w> This's <w> because people of India do not hate them but love them\n& appreciate what they have.\n\n\n They are so much involved in India that they\nalso follow caste system & many other things of India.\n\n\nPeople are also united because of religious ideas by many of the\nholy book like \" Gita, Koran,   \nBible   \" .\n\n\nThey follow the ideas & values of    these \n books.\n\n\nThey are also united because in India there are many such\nfestivals & fairs that are to be publicly played & enjoy.\n\n\nPeople take part in each of    their  \nfestivals.\n\n\nThey also enjoy with other people in    their\n  festivals.\n\n\nThey are also united because of war also.\n\n\nThere were many    attacks    from inside country & outside country also.\n\n\nThey have fought against all such odd unitedly & won much of them.\n\n\nThey do not    think   that  these persons are not from community so we should not save because\nwhen calamities will come on them    then   these\nare only the people to save them.\n\n\nBut due to    anti-social      elements   like smugglers, political leaders there\nbrings tensions in the country but these did  not cause any\n   attack   as people are united.\n\n\nSo it is said that   ` Indian society exhibits\nunity in diversity'  .  \n\n \n\n \n\nCauses of unemployment of the people in India are as follows:\n\n\n1) Many Industries or    agricultural \n activities take place in some seasons only like surgarcane factory,\ncultivation of crops & etc.\n\n\nSo much, of the period of the year people are\nunemployed.\n\n\n2) High birth rate is also responsible for unemployment.\n\n\n In India\nthere is addition of 2.5 % of population every year.\n\n\nBut the economic development is not much rapid as compared to\npopulation.\n\n\nSo that people can get employment. \n\n\n3) Many people are so poor that they cannot get there all  necessities.\n\n\nSo  how could they    afford \n to spend  money    on   the\neducation of     their  \nchildren.\n\n\nSo   why when people do not have\nemployment because of  education. \n\n\n4)  In our India education is not job-oriented.\n\n\nIt is only general education.\n\n\n5) Many Industries were started by the Britishers.\n\n\nAnd many skilled handicrafts because of that became unemployed.\n\n\n6) In India there is not fast   \nindustrialisation   taking place.\n\n\nSo that there cannot be employment   \nopportunities.  \n\n\n7) New    technology  \n   is   introduced of new  instead\nof old one.\n\n\nA nd this requires only less   \namount   of people.\n\n\nSo there is no employment.\n\n\n8) Economic development of our country is not progressing as well.\n\n\nSo there are  no  more employment\n   opportunities.   \n\n \n\n\n Conservation of renewable of resources in India:-\n\n\n \n\nRenewable resources are those resources which are in ample\nquantity and which does not get    exhausted \n\n\n\nThey can  be produced   \neither   by the human beings or by the nature.\n\n\n But we must conserve    these\n  resources  very well.\n\n\nBecause the resources are interlinked between themselves.\n\n\nAny faulty action towards them will cause serious effect.\n\n\nAnd by conservation we do not mean do not use the resources but we\nmust use it properly.\n\n\nThese  interlinked can be explained as\nfollows.\n\n\nIf we consume our forest, in wrong direction  or we\n go on cutting the plants without any consciousness do\ndeforestation in anyway.\n\n\nThen it can    affect   many other\nresources.\n\n\nPlants provide firmness to the soil.\n\n\n Soil particles are  attached because\nof the plants.\n\n\nBut if plants are cut away then they cannot hold soil particles &\nsoil particles are washed away by air or rain.\n\n\nMany of the deserts are man-made.\n\n\n We will not get the machine to take out our required\nwater from the deepest of the earth.\n\n\nBecause  roots of plants  absorb\nwater from the earth & give it to the air by leaves.\n\n\nAnd this fall into rains.\n\n\nAnd if we cut it will be affected.\n\n\nForests  provide  protection to animals & humans\n\n\nAnd give valuable food to these.\n\n\nBut if we do deforestation we will not get it.\n\n\nIf we spoil the air then it will be affected to us only.\n\n\nThen we will get numerous    diseases \n so we must try to conserve our resources in right way and when they are\ndemanded.\n\n\nBut not in faulty way  as it causes many problems.\n \n\n \n\n\nThe different types of  conflicts causing stress are\nas follows :\n\n\n Approach - - Approach Conflict : - \n\n \n\nIn this there are two goals which are of the same level and\nwhich are positive and desirable.\n\n\nPerson can take any one of them because they are  of\nequal importance.\n\n\nIf  a  person chooses one goal    then\n  he cannot choose another goal.\n\n\nHe  would have to depart it or cannot take it.\n\n\nThis causes mental stress as to choose which of the goals as they\nare of equal importance.\n\n\nSo person should calmly think over it  then  take the right\n   decision   .\n\n\nEg : -  Student cannot take \nsimultaneously B.Sc, B.Com, B.A or any other courses. \n\n \n\n2) \n\n\nApproach - Avoidance conflict : - \n\n\nIn this there is only one goal.\n\n\nIt is favourable, as well as it is   \nunfavourable   , it is desirable as well as undesirable, it is\npositive as well as negative.\n\n\n As there is no other goals student has to take\nonother  or apart from it.\n\n\nAnd live in that manner. \n\n \n\neg:- Student wants to join  Air force \n  but   he is afraid because of \nuncertainties of life & death in that.  \n\n\nAvoidance - Avoidance conflict : - \n\n \n\nIn this there are two goals.\n\n\nThese both goals are  undesirable,\nunfavourable, and negative.\n\n\nPersons generally do not like them & run away from  \n these   goals.\n\n\nBut he must not runaway from    these  \ngoals  ,  he should select    those   goals\nwhich    are   less  negative, less\nunfavourable, less undesirable than others.  \n\n\nDouble - Approach - Avoidance Conflict : - \n\n \n\nIn this also there are two goals.\n\n\nBut they are not of the same level.\n\n\nSome might be less positive, some might be less negative & etc.\n\n\nThese goals    have   some advantages &\nsome disadvantages.\n\n\nPerson has to think over it when selecting goal of this kind.\n\n\n When they take one goal they must think over\nadvantage & disadvantage of other goals also.\n\n\neg:-

{"text": "PHENOL METABOLISM IN RELATION TO IAA CONTENT, NODULATION  AND NITROGEN FIXATION IN ROOT NODULES OF LEGUMINOUS  TREES  \n\n\nT.K. DANGAR AND P.S. BASU Department of Botany, University of Burdwan,\nGolapbag, Burdwan - 713104   \n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n \n\nThe levels of free phenols ( total and monohydroxy ) and their\npolymerization by peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase varied seasonally, and in\nbetween the nodules and roots of   Butea monosperma and\nPterocarpus marsupium  . \n\n\nThe nodules and roots contained more free phenols during rainy season\nand lesser in the winter.\n\n\nPolymerization of phenols was less in the rainy season and was\nincreased gradually afterwards.\n\n\nHigher levels of total, monohydroxy and polymerized phenols were\nrecorded in the nodules than the roots of   P. marsupium\n  and  vice versa  in those of  B. monosperma.\n\n\n\nPhenol oxidase of some tissues did not show opposite relations with\nphenols throughout the year.\n\n\nThe free phenol levels changed parallel to IAA levels and nitrogenase\nactivity in the nodules.\n\n\nLeghaemoglobin content of nodules did not change significantly\nthroughout the year.  \n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n \n\nThe phenolic substances regulate some of the metabolic functions\nof plants ( Schneider and Wightman, 1974 ) including root nodules of\nleguminous herbs ( Pate, 1958; Vance, 1978 ) .\n\n\nThe monohydroxy phenols ( 2, 4 dichlorophenol) promote, and dihydroxy\nand polyphenols ( gossypol, chlorogenic acid, kaempferol etc. ) inhibit IAA\noxidase activity ( Stafford, 1974 ) .\n\n\nBut regulation of phenol metabolism in root nodules and roots of\nleguminous trees, and its relation with nitrogenase activity in different\nseasons were not studied.\n\n\nBesides, most of the studies on phenol metabolism are based on\ncolorimetric estimation of chromogenic groups which does not reflect the\ndegree of polymerization of phenols i.e. the availability of free monomers.\n\n\nSo, the conclusions drawn based only on colorimetric studies reflects\nincomplete idea  on phenol ( Siegel and Enns, 1979 )\nand their relations with other metabolic processes. \n\n \n\nConsidering the above limitations, the availability of free\nfunctional groups and the degree of polymerization of phenols were studied\nsimultaneously in the root nodules and roots of two hetherto unexplored\nleguminous trees viz.   Pterocarpus marsupium  \n Roxb.  and   Butea monosperma \n ( Lam. ) Taub. to enlighten the role of phenol metabolism on regulation\nof IAA metabolism, nodulation and nitrogen fixation in leguminous trees. \n\n\n\n MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\nThe nodules and roots of   P. marsupium and B.\nmonosperma   were collected from the plants growing naturally\nwithin the campus of the Burdwan University, West Bengal.\n\n\nExcept rainy seaon, the basins of the plants were watered @ 80 1 /\nsq.m. on every 4th day during the winter and summer seasons, and on every 6th\nday during the post-rainy sseason to maintain a 22 %<*>plus or minus</*>3\nmoisture level in the soil.\n\n\nThe basin soil was nurtured after 2d of watering and during the dry\nspells of the rainy season to loosen the soil.\n\n\nUnder these cultural practices, the nodules of any specific stage\ndevelop into uniform shape and size throughout the year.\n\n\nThe nodules of   P. marsupium   were\nalways spherical and those of   B. monosperma  \nbecame elongated and branched, to a limited extent, at maturity.\n\n\nThe nodules of both the plants do not senesce from the base but as a\nwhole. \n\n \n\nThe mature nodules were studied for the present communication.\n\n\nThe fresh and finest roots were collected from the nodulated plants,\nwashed throughly and observed under a microscope ( X20 ) to ascertain\ninitiation of nodulation.\n\n\nThe tips ( 2 mm) of the roots without nodule initials were removed\nand next 4-5 cm portions were used for the experiments. \n\n \n\nTotal phenol was estimated spectrophotometrically ( Bray and\nThrope, 1954 ) as ferulic acid equivalents and monohydroxy phenol content (\nEmerson, 1943 ) as hydroxybenzonic acid equivalents.\n\n\nThe UV absorption spectra of phenols were determined ( Stafford, 1960 )\nfrom portions of total phenol extracts. \n\n \n\nIAA was extracted ( Sinha and Basu, 1981 ) from fresh nodules and\nroots ( 50g ) , chromatographed ( thrice ) with authentic IAA on TLC plates\ncoated with silicagel G and developed with isopropanol : ammonia : water ( 10\n: 1 : 1, by volume ) .\n\n\nChromogenic reagent ( Hamilton  et al,  1961 ) was\nsprayed along the marker and comparing the pink spot ( Rf 0.85) of\nthe marker, developed after spraying, a gel band of Rf 0.8 - - 0.9\nwas scrapped off, eluted ( thrice ) in diethyl ether and evaporated in\nvacuum.  \n\n \n\nExtracted samples were methylated with diazomethane ( Rose and\nBradbeer, 1971 ) and chromatographed in a Pye Unicam GC column ( temp.\n190<*>degrees</*>C, 40 ml / min N2 as carrier gas).\n\n\nSamples were quantified comparing the peaks ( retention time 10.6 min )\nareas of extracted samples with those of known amount of authentic IAA.\n\n\nExperimental loss of IAA was calculated by running known amount of\nIAA parallelly with extraction of IAA from tissues and final results were\nrectified accordingly.\n\n\nBiological activity of the extracted samples were checked ( Basu and\nTuli, 1972 ) . \n\n \n\nIAA oxidase was extracted from fresh nodules and roots ( 1g ) and\nassyed following the method of ( Sinha and Basu, 1981 ) .\n\n\nPeroxidase and polyphenol oxidase enxymes of roots and nodules ( 200\nmg ) were extracted and measured at 420 nm ( Kar and Mishra, 1976 ) in terms\nof purpurogallin formation in 2 min.\n\n\nProtein content of the enzyme extracts were estimated ( Lowry  et\nal.,  1951 ) as bovine serum albumin equivalents. \n\n \n\nLeghaemoglobin of nodules was extracted ( Vance, 1978 ) from\nfresh nodules.\n\n\nAbout 200 mg fresh, mature nodules were incubated in a 10 ml vial\ncapped with a serum septa and incubated for 1-2h with air-acetylene ( 9 : 1 :\n: V : V ) mixture and ethylene was estimated comparing the values with those\nof the standard curve of ethylene.  \n\n\n RESULTS \n\n \n\nThe total and monohydroxy ( Fig. 1 ) phenol contents were higher\nin the nodules than roots of   P. marsupium   but\nchanged almost parallelly in all the seasons.\n\n\nLevels of phenols ( Fig. 1A, B ) were optimum in august ( rainy\nseason) and minimum in February ( Winter ) .\n\n\nThe phenols of the nodules and roots of   B. monosperma\n  followed the trends of changes of those of   P.\nmarsupium   ( Fig. 1A, B ) .\n\n\nUnlike   P. marsupium   , the phenol\ncontents in the nodules of   B. monosperma   were\nalways lower than those of the roots.\n\n\nBetween the two plants, the nodules of   P. marsupium\n  possessed more phenols than those of   B.\nmonosperma   ( Fig. 1A, B ) . \n\n \n\nThe peroxidase ( Fig. 1C ) and polyphenol oxidase ( Fig. 1D )\nenzymes were more active in the roots than the nodules of   P.\nmarsupium   and showed maximum and minimum levels of\nactivities in summer ( May ) and rainy seasons ( August ) , respectively.\n\n\nUnlike   P. marsupium  ,  the phenol\noxidase of   B. monosperma   was more active in\nthe nodules than the roots and did not follow any common trend of variation.\n\n\nThe phenol oxidase of nodules of   B. monosperma\n  was more active ( Fig. 1C ) in winter ( December / February ) .\n\n\nHowever, peroxidase activity of the roots of   B.\nmonosperma   was more active in post-rainy seasons ( September )\nand polyphenol oxidase activity of the roots did not change significantly.\n   \n\n \n\nThe UV difference spectra of the phenols of nodules of \n P. marsupium   and roots of   B.\nmonosperma   were higher than those of the respective roots\nand nodules ( Fig. 2A, B, C, D ) .\n\n\nAbsorptions at lower UV zone ( 250 nm ) , were higher in the rainy\nseason ( Fig. 2A ) , and in the following seasons it declined gradually (\nFig. 2B, C, D ) .\n\n\nContrary to these results, the absorptions at higher wavelengths (\n300, 350 nm ) were lower in the rainy season and increased gradually\nafterwards.\n\n\nHighest degree of polymerization of phenols ( complex polymeric\nphenols ) were recorded in the winter ( Fig. 2C ) when absorptions above 350\nnm remained almost unchanged. \n\n \n\nThe IAA levels and IAA oxidase activities changed oppositely in\nthe nodules of   P. marsupium   and \n B. Monosperma.  \n\n\nThe IAA levels were higher and IAA oxidase \n  activities were lower in winter but were\nreversed in the rainy season ( Fig. 3A, B ) .\n\n\nThe roots of the plants had minimum levels of IAA and higher IAA\noxidase activities and the former did not change seasonally.\n\n\nThe nitrogenase activity ( Fig. 4 ) changed parallelly with IAA level\n( Fig. 3A ) throughout the year and was comparatively less active in the\nnodules of   B monosperma   than that of \n P. marsupium.  \n\n\nLeghaemoglobin contents ( Fig.4) of the nodules did not vary\nsignificantly in different seasons.  \n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n \n\nDuring the rainy season ( August ) , lower peroxidase and\npolyphenol oxidase ( Fig. 1C & D ) activities in the nodules of \n P. marsupium   and   B. monosperma\n  would polymerize lesser phenol units ( Fig. 2A ) resulting\nin increase of free total and monohydroxy ( Fig. 1B ) phenols ( Stafford,\n1974 ) and more absorption at lower UV ( 250 nm ) zone ( Fig. 1A & B ) (\nSiegel and Enns, 1979 ) .\n\n\nHigher levels of free phenols would provide more di and polyphenols\nand inhibit IAA oxidase activity in the    nodules.\n\n\nEnhanced levels of IAA, lower IAA oxidase activity ( Fig. 3A & 3B )\nin the rainy season and no activity of IAA oxidase of the nodules of the\nplants support the view Lower degree of polymerization i.e. more absorption\nat 250 nm in the rainy season than the other seasons ( Fig. 2A, B, C, D )\nwould be due to lowest activities of the phenol oxidases ( Fig. 1C, D ) .\n\n\nFollowing the rainy season, free phenols declined gradually to a\nminimum level upto the winter ( December-January ) through the post-rainy\nseason ( October ) and concomitantly polymerization was increased i.e.\nabsorption at 250 nm was declined but increased gradually from 350 nm (\nFig. 2B, C ) .\n\n\nCorresponding to free and polymerized phenols the phenol oxidases\nalso increased upto the winter.\n\n\nFree phenols started increasing again from the summer ( March ) , and\nthe phenol oxidases and polymerization also changed accordingly.\n\n\nUnlike the nodules, regulation of phenol metabolism in the roots is\nunclear because the free phenols were not properly related with the\npolyphenol oxidase of   P. marsupium   and \n B. monosperma   .\n\n\nSuch discripancies might be due to indifferent expression of phenol\noxidases  in vitro  and  in vivo  conditions ( Stafford,\n1974 ) .   \n\n\nHigher phenol levels in the nodules than the roots of  \nP. marsupium   and  vice versa  in   B.\nmonosperma   would result from lower polyphenol oxidase in the\nrespective tissues.\n\n\nHigher absorptions at 250 nm by the phenols of the nodules of \n P. marsupium   and roots of   B.\nmonosperma   conform with the observations.\n\n\nVariation in the synthesis of phenols in different tissues by\nphenylalanine ammonia lyase ( PAL ) and tyrosine ammonia lyase ( TAL ) (\nStafford, 1974; Vance, 1978 ) would also cause differences of phenol levels.\n\n\nHigher phenol levels and lower polyphenol oxidase activity in the\nnodules of   P. marsupium   than  \nB. monosperma   implies that polymerized phenols should be\nlesser in the former but was higher throughout the year.\n\n\nProbably the   in situ   activities of\nphenol oxidases have not been expressed exactly after extraction and created\nconfusion.\n\n\nMore synthesis of phenols by PAL and TAL over polymerization in the\nnodules of   P. marsupium   than  \nB. monosperma   would also increase free phenols in the\nformer.\n\n\nSo, the results reveal that phenol metabolism can not be conjectured\n without simultaneous estimation of the functional\ngroups, phenol oxidases and polymerization.\n\n\nIt is expected that free phenols should be more in the nodules of the\nplants because they possess more IAA, lower oxidase activity than the\nrespective roots ( Vance, 1978 ) .\n\n\nBut lesser phenol level in the nodules than the roots of \n B. monosperma   contradicts the proposition. \n\n \n\nNo change in leghaemoglobin ( LH ) ( Fig. 4 ) along with the\nvariations in IAA andphenol metabolism, suggest that IAA metabolism imparts\nno significant effect on LH content of the nodules.\n\n\nProliferation and initiation of nodulation, regulation of primary\ngrowth by IAA ( Dart, 1974, 1977; Vance 1983 ) and monophenols ( Dart, 1974;\nSubba Rao, 1977; Garg  et al  ., 1989  <-> ) </- >  ( \n and accumulation of IAA ) inhibition of nodulation ) in the mature\nnodules; ( Charbonneau and Newcomb, 1985 ) support the idea.\n\n\nHowever, the changes of phenols and IAA metabolism in the mature\nnodules could be attributed to regulation of their physiological functions\nbut any such function is expeced to change simultaneously with the IAA\nmetabolism ( Charbonneau and Newcomb, 1985 ) .\n\n\nSo, parallel changes of nitrogenase activity ( Fig. 4 ) with IAA and\nphenols but opposite relations with IAA oxidase and phenol oxidases indicate\nthat they are interrelated.\n\n\nUnlike nodule initiation, growth and development, more IAA oxidation\nand mono phenols reduce while di and polyphenols enhance nitrogenase\nactivity.\n\n\nSo, in the rainy season, nitrogenase activity would be higher ( Fig.\n4 ) in the nodules of   P. marsupium   and \n B. monosperma   because of low IAA oxidase activity\nConcomitantly, lower phenol oxidases would result less polymerization and\nprovide more total free phenols  i.e.  more di and polyphenols to\nlimit IAA oxidase activity and facilitate the function of nitrogenase.\n\n\nHigher IAA also induces LH genes ( Verma and Nadler, 1984 ) and\nmaintain the LH level and increase nitrogenase activity in the rainy season.\n\n\nThough monophenols ( inhibitors of nitrogenase ) were also higher in\nthe nodules in the rainy season ( Fig. 1B ) but their inhibitory effects\nwould have been superseded by  di  and polyphenols.\n\n\nHowever, both promotive ( Rice and Parenti, 1967; Rice, 1971 ) and\ninhibitory ( Blum and Rice, 1969 ) effects of the phenols on the nitrogenase\nactivity have been reported.\n\n\nLike the rainy season, in other seasons also, IAA and phenols are\ncorrelated with the nitrogenase activity.\n\n\nIAA also enhances the nitrogenase activity of  Nostoc  upto\n50 <*> mu</*>g / ml but inhibits above 100 <*> mu</*>g / ml ( Chaporkar and\nGangawane, 1984). \n\n \n\nSo, it is evident from the observations that nitrogenase activity\nin the mature nodules of   P. marsupium   and\n  B. monosperma   is regulated by IAA and phenol\nmetabolism. \n\n\nNitrogenase activity changed parallelly with IAA and inversely with\nIAA oxidase activity.\n\n\nPhenol oxidases regulate free phenol levels and alters nitrogenase\nactivity through IAA metabolism.  \n\n\n ACKNOWLEDGEMENT \n\n \n\nFinancial assistance from \" CSIR \" , India is\nacknoledged.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5276408d-78b7-4f68-ac41-e4c8591438c6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.025405+00:00"}
{"text": "THE RIGHT TO WORK  \n\n\n   Making The Concept Feasible  \n\n\n \n\n \n\n  THE   movement for a\nconstitutional amendment to include the right to work in the list of\nFundamental Rights, which was launched in June, 1986, by the Citizens for\nDemocracy in association with a number of trade union organizations, has\ngathered considerable momentum since then.\n\n\nThe demand was accepted by the National Front and was incorporated in\nits election manifesto.\n\n\nThere is every reason to believe that, after coming to power, the\nNational Front Government intends to implement that election pledge. \n\n \n\nIn an important paper prepared and published at the time of\nlaunching the right to work movement, Dr. Dalip Swamy pointed out that\nunemployment had increased from 5.3 million in 1951 to 27.9 million by April,\n1986, and that about 350 million people in the country were below the\npoverty lilne.\n\n\nThis vast number indicates that underemployment is a more potent\ncause of mass poverty than total unemployment.\n\n\nThe right to work movement aims at ensuring full employment to all\nthose who desire to be occupied in gainful work.  \n\n\n  UNEMPLOYMENT  \n\n \n\nDr. Dalip Swamy emphasized that unemployment is mainly\nconcentrated in rural areas and that it prevails among poor cultivators,\nagricultural labourers and women.\n\n\nEmployment has failed to keep pace with the growth of population,\nwith the result that unemployment has been growing year after year.\n\n\nAgricultural holdings are being sub-divided due to the increase in\npopulation and rural households have been forced to operate on\nregressively smaller plots of land. \n\n \n\nWhat is more, there has been a continuous increase in the\ncapital-labour ratio - - the ratio between the capital invested and the\nworkers employed - - since 1956.\n\n\nEven excluding capital-intensive industries, the requirement of\ncapital per worker increased from  Rs.  20,266 in 1973-74\nto  Rs.  54,869 in 1982-83.\n\n\nThe paper pointed out that from 1973-74 to 1982-83, capital grew\nalmost four times faster than employment. \n\n \n\nThe figures available after Dr  paper indicate\nthat the increase in the capital-labour ratio has been more rapid than he\nestimated.\n\n\nIt has been found that in the whole private industrial sector in\nthe country, there was hardly any increase in employment between 1980 and\n1988 although private capital must have atleast doubled during that period.\n\n\nThis shows that even rapid growth in capital-intensive industry\noffers no solution to growing unemployment. \n\n \n\nMass poverty has been the main economic problem before us since\nbefore Independence.\n\n\nNearly four decades of economic planning have not made a palpable\ndent.\n\n\nFurther economic development in the same direction promises little\nrelief to the bulk of our people.\n\n\nThe purpose of the right to work movement is to require the\nGovernment and the Planning Commission to change the direction of economic\ndevelopment and to ensure that planning will be labour-intensive and not\ncapital-intensive. \n\n \n\nIt is worthy of note that basic needs - - food, water, shelter,\nclothing, education and health care - - are met by economic activities\nwhich are labour-intensive.\n\n\nThe proposed change in the direction of economic development\ntherefore implies not only a change from capital-intensive to\nlabour-intensive economic activities, but also a change in favour of the\nproduction and supply of goods and services which would satisfy the basic\nneeds of the vast majority of the people.\n\n\nThe luxuries sought by the upper strata of society will continue\nto be produced, but they will constitute a minor part of the total\neconomic product. \n\n \n\nThere are, however, some seriious objections to the proposal\nof the right to work being made a Fundamental Right under the Constitution.\n\n\nIt is necessary to examine the validity of these objections.\n\n\nFirst, if the right to work is made, a fundamental right, any person\nwho is presently jobless can apply to the High Court or the Supreme Court\nin order to mandate the state to give him a job.\n\n\nSuch a scheme would obviously be unworkable. \n\n \n\nSecondly, the right to work implies that whenever the state is\nunable to provide a job to the jobless, it must give employment relief in the\nform of a dole.\n\n\nThis is hardly possible in the present stage of economic development\nof the country. \n\n \n\nThirdly, it is implicit in the demand for the right to work\nthat the responsibility of finding employment is taken away from the\nunemployed and imposed on the state.\n\n\nIs it proper, it is asked, that the state should be called upon to\ndischarge the responsibility of providing jobs to all those who are\nunemployed? \n\n \n\nThe first two objections can be easily met.\n\n\nIt is not proposed that any jobless person should be able to approach\na court of law without adopting a procedure prescribed by a suitable law.\n\n\nNor is it proposed that the right to work should not be subject to\nreasonable restrictions arising from the economic stringency of the state.\n\n\nAll fundamental rights are subject to reasonable restrictions,  and the right to work will not be an exception to the rule.\n\n\nIn a seminar where the above two objections were discussed; the\npresent writer proposed by way of clarification that the demand could be\nimplemented by inserting in the Constitution an Article 21-A, in the\nfollowing or similar terms : \n\n \n\n \" All citizens above the age of 18 have the right to work\nwhich will be secured by a law of parliament embodying an\nemployment-guarantee scheme.\n\n\nThe right to work will be subject to reasonable restrictions imposed\non account of unavoidable financial stringency of the state.\" \n\n\n \n\nThis amendment specifies, in the first place, that the right to\nwork will be secured through a Central law which will provide for an\nemployment-guarantee scheme.\n\n\nSuch a state law, in fact, has prevailed in Maharashtra for the last\n12 years, and although it is confined to rural areas and requries\nimprovement in material particulars, it has provided substantial benefit\nto a number of jobless people living in rural areas. \n\n \n\nThe Maharashtra law lays down that any unemployed person in a\nvillage can apply to a certain revenue authority for a job, and it will be\nduty of that authority to provide a job to him at minimum wages within a\nperiod of 15 days.\n\n\nIf a job is not provided, unemployment relief must be given on a\nmodest scale for his maintenance.\n\n\nThe scheme makes it incumbent that economic planning in rural areas\nshould be such that an adequate number of jobs are available to those who are\nwholly unemployed. \n\n \n\nTo extend such an unemployment-guarantee scheme to urban areas\nis not difficult.\n\n\nThe main problem in Indian cities and towns relates to the provision\nof housing accommodation to hundreds of thousands of people who have to\nlive on pavements or in illegal makeshift hutments.\n\n\nAccording to research papers produced on the subject, most of these\npavement and hutment dwellers have some employment and can afford to pay a\nmodest rent for moderately decent accommodation. \n\n \n\nLarge-scale housing schemes in urban areas can thus provide\nemployment to thousands of workmen without causing a severe economic\nshortage.\n\n\nThus the first two common objections to the right to work being made\na fundamental right are not as formidable as they appear. \n\n \n\nThe third objection is more serious.\n\n\nIt assumes that if the state does not interfere in the economic\nprocess, the problem of unemployment and, consequently, of mass poverty\nwill be solved by the automatic functioning of a free-enterprise market\neconomy.\n\n\nThis assumption necessarily means that economic planning by the state\nis wholly redundant.\n\n\nThe best that a state can do to ensure the economic progress of the\npeople is to adopt a policy of non-interference in economic affairs. \n\n \n\nThis policy of  laissez-faire  is approved by\na large number of economists, particularly in Western countries, although\nthey are also in favour of a minimum regulatory function of the state,\nillustrated by such legislation as the Factories Act which provides for the\nmaximum number of working hours, minimum number of holidays and certain other\nfacilities to industrial workers.\n\n\nCan the policy of  laissez-faire  solve the\nproblem of mass poverty, unemployment and large-scale underemployment in\ncountries like India? \n\n \n\nState interference by economic planning is necessary in countries\nsuch as ours in order to ensure that a larger share of resources is diverted\nto labour-intensive economic activities.\n\n\nLeft to itself, free enterprise would result in the development of\ncapital-intensive industry, as has happened in India in the last 30 years.\n\n\nPlanning, therefore, is necessary, and planning must be oriented\ntowards employment generation.  \n\n\n  DEVELOPMENT  \n\n \n\nSuch employment-oriented economic development can take place in\nIndia in both the rural and urban sectors.\n\n\nMost of the unemployment is concentrated in the rural sector and that\nis why the economic development of this sector should be the pivot of Indian\nplanning.\n\n\nImprovement in agriculture will itself absorb a good deal more\nlabour, much as by the adoption of schemes of reclamation of waste-lands,\ndigging of field channels, contour bunding, prevention of soil erosion, and\nelimination of floods and waterlogging.\n\n\nA large number of small irrigation projects can be a source of\nsubstantial employment generation. \n\n \n\nIt is thus feasible to include the right to work in the\nFundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution.\n\n\nIt would indeed be a revolutionary step, for it will go a long way in\nsolving the basic problem of mass poverty in India.   <box>\n\n\n   INCORPORATING   the right to\nwork as a part of the Fundamental Rights is fraught with difficulties.\n\n\nBut argues V.M. Tarkunde, the former judge and human rights\nactivist, employment-oriented national planning can go a long way in\nmaking the concept feasible.  </box> \n\n    \n\n\n  TASTING INDIA   \n\n\n  A bargain at   Chor   Bizarre\n   \n\n \n\n It  is the winter season in Delhi and the \n dhabas   are overflowing.\n\n\nA meek sun timidly pushes aside the mid-morning mist.\n\n\n  Chaat   centres trade their spicy\nconcoctions to the multitudes.\n\n\nIt is cold again in Delhi and I am overcome with nostalgia for\nKashmiri food.\n\n\nThe afternoon shadows are beginning to lengthen as we drive up to the\nshabby looking Hotel Broadway on Asaf Ali Road on the fringes of old Delhi,\nto sample their Kashmiri food in their restaurant with the bizarre name of\n\" Chor Bizarre \" . \n\n \n\nThe last time I entered this hotel was as a college student two\ndecades ago.\n\n\nIt was a posh and fashionable place then and I remember through the\naromatic mists of time how we would devour their hot   tandoori\n  offerings.\n\n\nChor Bizarre is also known for its   tandoori \n delicacies which have been given a good chit by my friends Karen and\nGul Anand in their useful and very readable  Penguin Food Lovers Guide to\nIndia and Nepal  , but their most descriptive paragraphs have been\nreserved for the Kashmiri Wazwaan ( Kashmiri Muslim Feast) served here.\n\n\n taken around the restaurant to see the outlandish\nfurnishings lifted from various Chor Bazaars around the country.\n\n\nMuch has been made of the four-poster which has been turned into a\ntable or the 1927 Fiat - - the  Chaat  Mobile - - which has an\narray of vegetarian salads,   chaats   and desserts\nunder its bonnet.\n\n\nThe restaurant has a pleasing ambience. \n\n \n\nI am less impressed with their Thugs Bar.\n\n\nThe paintings of villains from Hindi films are amateurish and the\natmosphere is seedy.\n\n\nPerhaps it is meant to be so.\n\n\nThe names of the drinks, though, are interesting and good for a laugh\n- - or a refill.\n\n\nMy friend orders a  ` Kalia'  - - a rum and coke - -\nand I sip an   ` Arre O samba'   - - a whisky\nsour in honour of my excellent friend, of the same name, screen villain\nMacmohan, who could have had his picture up here too.\n\n\nThe whisky is too sour for my liking and I switch to a Bloody Mary\nentitled  ` Mona Darrling'  . \n\n \n\nWe are now in the right frame of mind for the abbreviated \n ` Wazwaan'   or Kashmiri feast.\n\n\nMy friend concentrates on rice and   yakhni  \n- - meat cooked in   dahi   over a slow fire.\n\n\nHe shares some of my   palak   , cooked in\nthe   ` Haak'   or   ` Karam Ka\nSaag'   style.\n\n\nGood  haak  is not easily available in Delhi and\n  palak   is a tasty substitute.\n\n\nIn a traditional  Wazwaan  comprising more than 50\nitems including exotic  chutneys  , the food is served in a\n  trami   or large bowl.\n\n\nThe rice is heaped high on the bowl and four people sit around it and\neat from the same  trami  .\n\n\nA wall of rice separates you from your  territory\nand the   wazas   or cooks come around and serve you\nthe dainty meat preparations, one by one.\n\n\nLiterally so, because there are no second helpings.\n\n\nThere are so many courses, all delicious, that it would be vulgar to\nask for seconds.\n\n\nBut here there are only four or five items and I go for another\nhelping of the   rista   , finely pounded balls of\nmince meat in a fine red sauce.\n\n\nThere is a crisp piece of   tabakmaaz   (\nfried ribs) on my plate.\n\n\nA promising beginning to the meal, coupled with   haak (\npalak), dam aloo,   and beaten   dahi   .\n\n\nThe great disappointment, though, is the   goshtaba \n the royal dish, a large white ball of minced   <*> line from\nleft to right</*> meat, redolent with the   dahi  \nand spices in which it is cooked for hours.\n\n\nThis   goshtaba   tastes dry and dense.\n\n\nIt does not have the springy, juicy texture of the real thing. \n\n \n\nThe   phirni ( kheer)   has to be\nabandoned.\n\n\nSurely this is not Kashmiri   phirni   ?\n\n\nIt is too thick and hard and did I detect, horrors, some coconut in\nit? \n\n \n\nThe Kashmiri tea is fair but in a place like \" Chor\nBizarre \" it would be innovative to serve it in an original Kashmiri\n  samovar   ( preferably stolen). \n\n \n\nIt is nearly five  in the evening and we are\nstuffed.\n\n\nThe day has passed well, even without counting the apertifs at the\n Bar! \n\n \n\nThe following morning I find myself automatically, almost\nritualistically drawn like a magnet to the Bengali Sweet House at Bengali\nMarket and its tempting variety of hot and cold  chaat  . \n\n \n\nBengali Market has been synonymous with Bengali Sweet House ever\nsince I can remember.\n\n\nKaren and Gul Anand in their  Food  Guide \nspeak lovingly of  `  '  which sprang up\nopposite.\n\n\nI have eaten there and have no complaints.\n\n\nBut my loyalties lie with Bengali Sweet House whose  \nchaat   has hastened my growth into manhood.\n\n\nTime stands still as I devour huge   golguppas \n dipped in iced, spiced   pani   , followed\ncompulsorily by   papri chaat   , which includes\n  papri   , potatoes,   dahiwadas \n in beaten   dahi   with just the right\nspicing and a sprinkle of ginger slivers and pomegranate seeds.\n\n\nNext follows the crisp   tikia   .\n\n\nThere is nothing like it in Bombay.\n\n\nThe anaemic and rubbery   ragra pattice   is\nno match for this full-bodied potato cutlet with dark savoury  \nchole   , superbly flavoured green and red  chutney\n with a helping of chopped onions.\n\n\nAnd last in the ritual is a steaming hot   gulab jamun\n  , straight from the smoking   kadhai  \nbefore us.\n\n\nNo further meal is required for the day. \n\n \n\nAnd if it is, look for it in the gracious environment of India\nInternational Centre at Lodi Estate.\n\n\nOf course, one needs to be a member but you can get in as a guest.\n\n\nThe Centre is the most affordable place in Delhi for its luxurious\nambience.\n\n\nIts frawling gardens.\n\n\nAnd it serves the best range of food under one roof.\n\n\nMixed Punjabi Mughlai menus in Chinese restaurants are to be\nscrupulously avoided but seated in the elegant dining hall of the Centre with\nits huge picture windows one can order spinach soup and spaghetti, roast\nchicken, beef steak and steamed fish and be sure of superb flavour each time.\n\n\nAnd if you request executive chef Vijay Kumar early enough you could\nbe served Chicken Monaco ( boneless chicken in sherry sauce garnished with\ncubes of capsicum, olives and mushrooms), or Fish Walasca ( fish stuffed with\nprawns in wine sauce). The Chinese food is as good and served on a hot plate.\nAfter reading all this you will be astonished to find that the most popular\nitem at the Centre is still their   tandoori   food.\nMy disappointment of the month - - or decade if you please - - was dining at\n the   tandoori   speciality\nrestaurant at Pandara Road.\n\n\nI did not need Karen and Gul  recommendation to\nvisit it.\n\n\nI have eaten here many times before.\n\n\nThe   tandoori   food has always been\noutstanding and I have been impressed by its one innovation not witnessed by\nme in any other restaurant.\n\n\nThe   tandoori   food is served sealed in\nsilver foil to preserve its heat and juices.\n\n\nBut not any more.\n\n\nMy memories are of a long time ago. I took two friends from Europe\nspecially for the imagined treat but it was a disappointment on all counts\nexcept for  kalmi Kabab  .\n\n\nThe   tandoori   platter was smothering in a\ndeadening unfamiliar sauce.\n\n\nThe fish   tikka   was dry and powdery, the\n  reshmi kabab   leathery and sharp.\n\n\nThe   roomali rotis   were thick and\nsmudged.\n\n\nThe only thing that seems to have maintained its standard was the\nbrain curry and we polished off two full platters.\n\n\n has a more sophisticated look now with specially\ncommissioned Himalayan paintings on the wall but perhaps its success has bred\nweariness and cynicism.\n\n\nIf it continues this, then the original Pindi Tandoori restaurant of\nmy college years, across the square, may just make a comeback.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9695d82e-2587-4173-bb7a-df6444f3f587", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.026517+00:00"}

{"text": "Classical dance in Karnataka   \n\n\n by Leela Ramanathan \n\n \n\n  THE   strange desire for\nanonymity in ancient India has led to the loss of a sizeable portion of our\nart history over the years - - almost up to the 17th century.\n\n\nConsequently, the modern art-historian faces the difficult task\nof reconstructing facts, through a study of the sculpture and the literature\nof relevant periods, and basing them more on surmise and conjecture than\non established facts. \n\n \n\nHowever, a few undeterred researchers have managed to present a\nfairly comprehensive account of the growth and development of the\nperforming art forms in Karnataka. \n\n \n\nThat dance existed in a very highly evolved form in Karnataka\nis evident from a study of the exquisitely carved dancing  \nMadanikas   of the Belur and Halebid temples.\n\n\nThere are also in existence innumerable legends which describe the\ndances of the Hoysala queens, Shantala and Sovalla, in the pillared halls of\nthese temples - - these belong to the 12th and 13th centuries AD. \n\n \n\nIt is apparent that out of these classical dance forms that\nflourished in the temples and courts of Karnataka has emerged what is\nknown today as the  ` Mysore style'  .\n\n\nIt should also be mentioned that the great universities of Talapadi\nand Talagunda ( 4th to 13th centuries) offered courses in classical dance\nand music, as also the royal dynasties of the   Rastrakutas, the Chalukyas, the Hoysalas, the kings of\nVijayanagar and the Wadeyars. \n\n \n\nThere is a substantial amount of evidence in Kannada\nliterature, as almost every medieval Kannada poet seems to have been a\nconnoisseur of music and dance.\n\n\n Mahakavi  Pampa, for instance, mentions Bharatha (\nthe compiler of the   Natyasastra   ) by name as the\n \" author of the dance\"  while Ponna, Ranna and Nagachandra\nuse the word  ` Bharatha'  to indicate dance, drama and music.\n\n\nBahubali, Bhimakavi and Singaraja poets of a later period also refer\ncopiously to Bharatha. \n\n \n\nIn addition to these, there seems to be a considerable body of\nepigraphical evidence to draw upon, like the famous Nallalla copper plates (\n6th century AD) and other inscriptions which extol Vishnuvardhana, queen\nShantala and other patrons and dancers. \n\n \n\nThe earliest mention of  Bharata  Natyam is to\nbe found in the famous   kriti   of Purandaradasa,\n  Adidano Ranga   where the word   Adidano\n  obviously referred to  ` dance'  . \n\n \n\nFrom all these we can deduce that  Bharata Natyam \nin ancient and medieval Karnataka existed both in temples and the courts of\nkings.\n\n\nAs is widely known, the classical dance in south India was primarily\na temple art, practised by  Devadasis  .\n\n\nThe temple dancers not only performed at all the temple festivals\nbut participated in the daily ritual of worship as well. \n\n \n\nThe  Devadasis  of the temples in Kolar, Bangalore\nand Muguru were accomplished dancers, like the famous Jeejamma, Kalamma   and others who paid great attention to\n  abhinaya   .\n\n\nSome of them were not averse to dancing for social occasions and\noften presented erotic songs in the   Lokadharmi  \nstyle. \n\n \n\nHowever, because of the growing denigration of the art, most fo\nthese dancers faded away and ended their days in abject penury and neglect.\n\n\n \n\nThe court dancers, on the contrary, flourished because of royal\npatronage, until about 1952, when the custom of appointing  \nAsthana Vidhushis   was given up.\n\n\nThey enriched  Bharata Natyam  and added a new\ndimension to the  abhinaya  aspect. \n\n \n\nAbout the 19th century, the four Tanjore brothers - -\nChinnayya, Ponniah, Shivanandam and Vadivelu - - gave the \nBharata Natyam  recital a fresh look and a new format which is\nfollowed even today.\n\n\nThe eldest of them, Chinnayya, was invited to the royal court of\nMysore by the king, where he settled down and helped to develop the already\nexisting dance form. \n\n \n\nIncidentally, it was during the Wadeyar regime that \nBharata Natyam  was concentrated in Mysore, the capital city, and\nattained a definite status.\n\n\nAttracted by the generosity and encouragement of the Wadeyars,\nartists of great ability and reputation began to flock to the Mysore\ncourt.\n\n\nA school was set up in Srirangapatnam during    Narasaraja  regime ( 1638 to 1659 AD ) where young\ngirls were trained in  Bharata Natyam  . \n\n \n\n Geetagopala  and  Chikkadevaraya Saptapadi \nwere composed in the style of   Ashtapadi  by\nChikkadevaraya Wadeyar ( 1672-1704 ) and were primarily meant for dancing.\n\n\nThe  Churnika  , a musical piece in praise of the kings and\nthe   audience,\nbegan to be performed before the start of a  Bharata Natyam \nrecital and soon became a part and parcel of the  ` Mysore style'\n . \n\n \n\nIt was during Krishnaraja  rule ( 1811-1868)\nthat the existing traditions of dance merged and what is now referred to as\nthe Mysore School emerged with certain distinctive traits. \n\n \n\nIllustrious  gurus  like Muguru Subbanna, Kittappa\nand Giriappa and accomplished dancers like Muguru Ammanniamma, Coimbatore\nTayi, Bangalore Nagarathnamma and Jetti Tayamma worked hard to build up the\nMysore style.\n\n\nThey were not only well-versed in Sanskrit, Telugu and Kannada but\nalso had a profound knowledge of Carnatic music and the technique of\n Bharata Natyam  . \n\n \n\nSome of the  Devadasis  built up libraries of rare\nmanuscripts and had special songs composed for their recitals by their\nlearned musical associates.\n\n\nThey even created a guild of dancers consisting of senior dancers,\nteachers, and scholars well-versed in   \nNatyasastra   , which established very high standards in dance.\n\n\n \n\n  HOW   exactly should the\nMysore school of  Bharata Natyam  be defined?\n\n\n Bharata Natyam  is basically the same all over\nsouth India with slight differences, if any, from region to region - -\ncomparable to the   gharanas   of the Hindustani\nmusic and the   banis   of the Carnatic music.\n\n\nThe Mysore style is characterised by certain special performing\nconventions such as the   Mangala sloka   sung by the\nNattuvanar at the beginning, followed by   Tattakara \n on the cymbals, the   Ganesha Van dana  \n, and the   Mangala   . \n\n \n\nAfter this lengthy presemble, the dancer comes in, salutes the\n guru  and the audience, and then performs a  \nChurnika   - - a Sanskrit prologue in prose ( without \n tala   , but set to a single   raga \n ) enumerating the constituents of dance and music as laid down by\nBharatha.\n\n\nBefore this, the   Pushpanjali   , scattering\nflowers all over the stage, is performed. \n\n \n\nAfter this follows the entire recital of   Sadir\nKatcheri   ranging from the   alarippu  \nto the   tillanna   followed by   abhinaya\n  for   slokas   and  \nJavalis   , considered the highlight of the programme. \n\n \n\nThus, barring minor divergences based on individual\npreferences and regional differenes, the Bharata Natyam recital has\nthe same routine throughout south India. \n\n \n\nIt is also said that the Mysore School places greater stress on\n  abhinaya   and   nritya  \nthan on   nritta   or pure dance which is by no means\nneglected.\n\n\nThis is perhaps due to the fact that eminent musicians who resided in\nthe court then composed special songs for the dancers, who responded by\nbringing out the various nuances of the song, through their exquisite dancing\nand miming. \n\n \n\nTalking of   abhinaya   reminds us of the\nlegendary Jetti Tayamma who reached unparalleled heights in this\nparticular aspect of dance.\n\n\nSome scholars attribute the   Churnika   to\nher, for she was not only an exquisite dancer, but an erudite scholar who had\nbeen trained by the learned poets of the royal court and was capable of\ncreativity of the highest order. \n\n \n\nThe court dancer or   Asthana Vidhushi  \n, we are told, was specially selected from groups of highly-trained\ndancers, wellversed in   nritta, nritya   and\n  natya   , by a panel of scholars, musicians and\nconnoisseurs of the art.\n\n\nHer training continued even after her appointment, and she had to\ninvariably perform at the palace on the birthdays of the  Maharajas\n , during the famed  Dassara  celebrations and other\nspecial occasions. \n\n \n\nIncidentally, the Mysore style abounds in Sanskrit  \nslokas, ashtapadas   and   Javalis  \nprobably because of the close association that   Asthana Vidhushis\n  had with the scholars and composers of the court.\n\n\nExtempore improvisation was the hallmark of good  \nabhinaya   and often the palace dancers were acclaimed for their\ncapacity to  \" create on the spot\"  and winning great\napprobation from the   cognoscenti   and\nscholars of the court.\n\n\nThis is probably the reason for the style acquiring the reputation\nof laying greater stress on   abhinaya   than on\n  nritta   . \n\n \n\n  ABOUT   the third quarter of\nthe present century, inspired by patriotic fervour and the consequent desire\nto revive our cultural forms, a great renascence of our performing arts\ntook place.\n\n\nArtists and intellectuals in Karnataka, as in the rest of South\nIndia, made attempts to bring dance, music and drama - - which by now had\nbecome separate art forms - - on to the stage, and succeeded.\n\n\nThus dance ceased to be a temple and palace art and became an art of\nthe theatre.\n\n\nInevitably, the monopoly of the temple and palace dancers ended and\nthe dance form was thrown open to dancers from all strata of society. \n\n \n\nUday Shankar, inspired by Pavlova, the great ballerina, came back\nfrom the West and helped considerably in converting the art into a proper\ntheatre form with suitable accoutrement like lighting, decor, orchestrated\nmusic, costumes and thematic content.\n\n\nRukmini Devi entered the arena of  Bharata Natyam  at\nthe age of 32.\n\n\nShe also set up the famed school, Kalakshetra, wherein the classical\ndance form, particularly  Bharata Natyam  , were refined\nand made suitable for    theatrical  \npresentation in the shape of dancedramas. \n\n \n\nIn Karnataka, U.S. Krishna Rao and Chandobagha Devi, through\ntheir pioneering efforts, made dancing respectable and acceptable.\n\n\nSenior dancers like Shanta Rao, Leela Ramanathan and Maya Rao have\nalso set up their institutions in Bangalore. \n\n \n\nThere are several other senior  gurus  and dancers\nwho have set up successful dance schools in Mysore, Bangalore, Kolar,\nMangalore and other cities of Karnataka.\n\n\nSome of the young dancers work for the departments of dance in\nuniversities while some others teach in well-known dance schools.\n\n\nA few work at jobs which are totally unrelated to their art, in order\nnot only to survive but to sustain and support their dancing. \n\n \n\nAfter Independence, the personal patronage of the king has\nbeen replaced by the impersonal patronage of the Government dispersed through\nits academies and departments of culture.\n\n\nThe warm, personal relationship between the patron and the artist\nhas been replaced by the objective impersonal patronage of bureaucracy\nwhich of course can become corrupt, if misused.\n\n\nHowever, one good that has emerged out of all this is that the art is\nno longer elitist or monopolistic but is made freely available to the\ncommon man. \n\n \n\nThe conversion of a temple art into a theatre art has led to\ncertain fundamental changes in the format and objectives of the classical\ndance.\n\n\nFor one, classical dance - - which was a spiritual offering to the\nLord presented symbolically, through a depiction of human themes and\nemotions - - meant to lift the spectator to a higher state, through\nentertainment, as laid down by Bharatha. \n\n \n\nIt has now become a theatre art meant to delight and entertain\ngeneral audiences.\n\n\nCertain changes have become inevitable such as shortening the\ndurations of recitals, altering choreography to suit the stage, changing\nthe repertoire, and paying greater attention to lighting, costume and the\nliterary content of songs. \n\n \n\nIn Karnataka a noteworthy contemporary tendency among the dancers\nis their keen interest in the dance-drama form.\n\n\nSome are falling back upon the   puranas  \nand   itihasas   for thematic content, while others\nare experimenting with new topics which are relevant to contemporary life.\n\n\nThe Yakshagana dancedrama form, which made its appearance\naround the 12th century and which has its roots in the classical Sanskrit\ndrama of the 4th century, is flourishing again as a popular theatre art. \n\n \n\nThere are many  Parishats, Sabhas  , the State\nacademies, the department of Kannada and Culture and of course innumerable\nschools where  Bharata Natyam  , which continues to be the\nmost prevalent form in Karnataka, is taught.\n\n\nWith unbelievably large numbers of youths taking to dance, the\ncompetition is overwhelming. \n\n \n\nApart from  Bharata Natyam  , other forms slowly\ngaining ground are  Kuchipudi, Kathak  and  Mohini\nAttam  .\n\n\n Odissi  of Manipuri are lagging behind, though\nperformances of these forms seem quite popular. \n\n \n\nDancing for the television shows is the latest fad, because young\ndancers feel they are able to reach out to larger audiences.\n\n\nIn fact, the dancer has never had it so good, with the opportunities\noffered in the shape of scholarships, participation in workshops and\ncompetititons, the chances to perform at festivals both at home and abroad\nand on television. \n\n \n\n  WHAT   is the future of dance\nin our country as a whole and in Karnataka in particular?\n\n\nGoing by the present trends, one can visualise the future fairly\nclearly. \n\n \n\nOne such trend is that dancing is becoming a group effort.\n\n\nSolo dances are no longer popular either with patrons of the art or\nthe general audiences who seem to prefer dance-dramas with a plethora of\ncharacters, group performances with as many dancers as the stage can hold,\nand combined choreographic presentations of a number of  gurus\n . \n\n \n\nThis trend may develop further, until permanent troupes of\ndancers are maintained by governments in all States.\n\n\nTo qualify to be a member of one of these troupes will be the\n  summum bonum   of a \ncareer.\n\n\nThere may come a time when the individual or solo dancer may be\nlooked upon as an eccentric and will have a hard furrow to plough. \n\n \n\nAnother trend is the realisation that apart from depicting\nmyths and legends centred around gods and goddesses, dancing could be used to\nexpress contemporary life and its problems.\n\n\nThis is bound to result in the art losing its inherent\nspirituality and impersonality, and becoming a highly personalised and\nsubjective expression of a  individuality.\n\n\nSuch trends may lead to a hybridisation of styles and forms which\nwould ignore the glorious heritage of dancing that we have inherited from\nour ancestors.\n\n\nOn the contrary, it may also lead to the creation of a common or\nnational style of dancing, similar to the  Bharata Natyam \nprevalent in the country before the 10th century AD. \n\n \n\nFortunately, in Karnataka the classical dance tradition has\nalways been a dynamic one and will, one is sure, continue to flourish\nbecause our dancers, however  avant-garde  they are, have\na great respect for our ancient dance culture and have always created and\ninnovated within its framework.  <*> filled circle </*>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "28178e51-d5b2-43e9-a584-0920f7904ed4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.029548+00:00"}

- remunerative prices to farm produce and\nassured minimum wages to farm labourers.\n\n\nIt has been decided to include minimum wages component, the factor\nof price rise between the time of announcement of support price and the time\nof actual harvesting of the crop and management cost, while fixing prices of\nfarm produce.\n\n\nInclusion of minimum wages while computing remunerative prices,\nshould avoid conflict between farmers and farm labourers, he said. \n\n\n Cotton export \n\n \n\nThe decision to release quota of ten  lakh  cotton\nbales for export in response to a demand by cotton growers, was also cited as\na step taken by his government in the interest of the farmers.\n\n\nMr. Singh also announced that immediate instructions will be issued\nto cancel orders for importing rice.\n\n\nHis attention towards rice import decision was drawn by Mr. Vijay\nJawandhia, Chairman of Kisan Coordination Committee comprising\nrepresentatives of farmers organisations all over the country. \n\n \n\nCommenting on repeated reference to his attending the Kisan\nCoordination Committee meeting in December last, the first Prime Minister\nto do so, Mr. Singh said  \" when Prime Ministers address meetings of\ntraders organisations like FICCI and ASSOCHAM, why should he not go to KCC\nmeetings\"  . \n\n \n\nThe Prime Minister also laid stress on the need to remove social\ninequalities.\n\n\nThe decision to extend statutory reservations to neo-Buddhists was a\nstep in this direction, he observed.\n\n\nHe was referring to Mandal Commission recommendations when someone\nfrom the crowd raised the demand of  Karjmukti  diverting his\nattention. \n\n \n\nIn his speech lasting for about 30 minutes, Mr. Singh also\nreferred to the  \" one rank-one pension\"  demand of\nex-servicemen.\n\n\nStating that his government has already accepted it, Mr. Singh\nobserved   \" I do not consider ex-servicemen as pensioners.\n\n\nThey have a responsibility of frustrating designs of those trying to\ncreate a communal divide in the society\"   . \n\n \n\nThe Prime Minister was earlier welcomed by  Shetkari\nSanghatana  leader Mr. Sharad Joshi. \n\n \n\nMr. Joshi in his address lauded the steps taken by the Prime\nMinister Mr. Singh in the interest of farmers.\n\n\nThe  Sanghatana  leader hailed him ( Mr. Singh) as the\n \" messiah of farmers\"  , the only one after mythological King\n 'Baliraja'  .\n\n\nAll other rulers, all these years have only exploited the farmers, he\nremarked. \n\n \n\nMr. Joshi said his prediction that 1989-90 would prove to be a\nyear of liberation of farmers, has come true.\n\n\nThe new Prime  policy declaration at the meeting\nof Kisan Coordination Committee on December 31 last has given enough\nindication of coming change.\n\n\n  \" Never before in the history, farmers had such a good\nopportunity liberating themselves.\n\n\nBut at this crucial juncture, certain forces are trying to create a\ncommunal divide.\n\n\nIn the name of Ayodhya temple or on some other pretext, they want to\ncreate a rift in the society and bring back the caste system based on\nexploitation,\"   the  Sanghatana  leader said\nsounding a warning.\n\n\nHe appealed to farmers to frustrate any such move. \n\n \n\nThe  Sanghatana  leader assured on behalf of\nfarmers that every effort would be made to raise farm output provided the\nfarmer is given his due.\n\n\n \" To express gratitude to the nation, he will toil to\nincrease agricultural production from the coming season\"  , Mr. Joshi\nsaid amidst applause. \n\n \n\nUnion Minister, Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan, in his speech, appealed to\n Dalits  in Maharashtra to join the forces committed to\nbring about social justice end equality. \n\n \n\nKisan Coordination Committee Chairman, Mr. Vijay Jawandhiya\nappealed to the Prime Minister to concede the demand of remunerative prices\nto farm produce so that the farmers would be in a position to return the crop\nloan and live with dignity.\n\n\n Shetkari Sanghatana  Maharashtra State Unit\nPresident, Mr. Shankar Dhondge conducted the proceedings. \n\n \n\nThe  Sanghatana  \" Vichar Yatra\"  \nfunction concluded with an oath administered to farmers by  Sanghatana\n leader Sharad Joshi.\n\n\nWith their fists raised, the farmers took a pledge to work for\none-point demand of remunerative prices to farm produce without giving any\nconsideration to communal and caste differences.  \n\n\n\n\n Tigers slay Tamil Provincial Minister \n\n \n\n<@PR> MADRAS {#}, <@DR> Jan. 28 {#} ( <@SR> UNI {#}):\n- -

- though mind you      \nonly an unsupported theory as yet - -  possible that some\nmutation somewhere caused mobilization or synthesis of high tin quantities.\n\n\nProbably in the lethal combinations.\n\n\nAnd the Robos didn't take any corrective+ because tin was not\nincluded in the monitoring parameters.\n\n\nAnd the fault went on multiplying, accentuating.\"  \n\n\n \n\n \" Did this defective <*> dotted-line</*> um <*>\ndotted-line</*> Carderelli <*> dotted-line</*> describe what would happen\nwith the overdoses?\"  asked Rin-Tac-Cy, now interested\nprofessionally. \n\n \n\n  \" It would play havoc.\n\n\nBody fluids oozing out as the gross, overt manifestation.\n\n\nMutations, delayed neurotoxicity,\"   replied\nNiv-San-Ris. \n\n \n\n \" In other words, the plants we see here, if imbibed by\nthese bipeds, would kill them or maim them permanently,\"  summed up\nTel-Xar. \n\n \n\n \" Why couldn't they shut off the computers and reprogram\nthe robots?\"  asked Rin-Tac-Cy, plaintively, in distress. \n\n \n\n  \" Ignorance and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\n\nBy the time the plants became lethal, the race may have forgotten\nhow to control the machines.  <*> black-square</*> <*>\nblack-square</*> <call-out> \n\n\nBut the Robos were the guardians of the plants.\n\n\nThe plants were protected.\n\n\nThe bipeds were not  </call-out> <*> black-square</*> <*>\nblack-square</*>\n\n\nThe machines were then controlling them.\n\n\nPerhaps they did figure out that the plants had turned killers.\n\n\nBut the Robos were the guardians of the plants.\n\n\nThe plants were protected.\n\n\nThe bipeds were not.\n\n\nThey lost, \"   said Rax-Gii. \n\n \n\n \" Think there might still be   \nsurvivors   ? \"  asked Tel-Xar. \n\n \n\n \" That we shall find out,\"  declared Rax-Gii.\n <*> star</*> <*> star</*> <*> star</*>\n\n \n\nAt first sight they appeared a+ tattered lot.\n\n\nThe scout team had called the ship as soon as they had sighted them.\n\n\nRax-Gii had swiftly reached the spot along with his team of\nspecialists for handling first encounters.\n\n\nHidden in clumps of mangroves and rocky dunes, they tried,\nliterally, to run into the sea as the Vai-gans approached.\n\n\nNo one put up even a token resistance, or made any approach at\ncommunication.\n\n\nOn closer scrutiny, they turned out to be more sorry, miserable,\nshaggy and unkempt than the Vai-gans had imagined.\n\n\nWith difficulty, Tel-Xar managed to select and cajole the most\npromising specimen of the lot into a dialogue in their own lingo which the\nVai-gans had already mastered from their meticulously preserved tapes.\n\n\nHe was a young male.\n\n\nPhlegmatic, taciturn, but willing to answer in monosyllables.\n\n\nHe didn't have much to add to what they had already conjectured.\n\n\nIt had been the old story of racial decadence.\n\n\nThey had reached the zenith of opulence and fallen into indolence.\n\n\nThe machines had taken over all the menial tasks. \n\n \n\nSuper-computers and robots had taken over the machines.\n\n\nThe sentient masters languished, wallowing in leisure, pleasures and\nperversions.\n\n\nLife became an unending orgy.\n\n\nThe machines had been made well.\n\n\nThe computers designed superbly.\n\n\nThey continued to serve silently, efficiently.\n\n\nThe orgies continued uninterrupted for centuries.\n\n\nBut the living machines had too many inbuilt potentials for errors.\n\n\nThese surfaced, both in the bipeds and the plants which fed them.\n\n\nThe former did realize, albeit dimly, what was going wrong.\n\n\nBut by then, the human race had run out of  ` eggheads'\n to take corrective measures.\n\n\nSo that when the crunch came - - literally - - with the tin\nmagnifying in the foods, and the diseases, disabilities and deaths, all the\nfatted calves could do to avoid the scythe was to vaguely identify the plants\nas the source of their misery and run as far away from them as possible.\n\n\nTo the coastline.\n\n\nLearning to live off the sea, on what the tides brought in, and the\nseaweeds.\n\n\nThey+ managed to cultivate a few outlandish plants which didn't maim\nthem.\n\n\nAnd this was the penultimate tragic scene in the story of these\nbipeds on which the Vai-gans had chanced upon.\n\n\nThe bipeds had given themselves various names with exalted\nconnotations in their heyday - - Humanity, Mankind,   Homo\nsapiens   or Man, the wise.\n\n\n \" Not so wise, in retrospect,\"  remarked Tel-Xar,\nthe exobiologist, whose vast perspective entitled him to comment. \n\n \n\n \" Well, do we leave them like this <*> dotted-line</*>\nto die?\"  asked Rax-Gii a little peevishly.\n\n\nHe hated taking decisions like this.\n\n\nGive him simple space navigation any day.\n\n\nHe was grateful he had Tel-Xar to take care of such things. \n\n \n\n \" No-o <*> dotted-line</*> \"  said Tel-Xar.\n\n\n  \" Now that we are here, maybe we could give their\nprogression - - if you can call it that - - a little nudge.\"  \n\n\n \n\n \" And how do you propose to do that?\"  asked\nNiv-San-Ris.\n\n\n \" You should know,\"  said Tel-Xar.\n\n\n  \" Remove the cause.\n\n\nDestroy all the plants.\n\n\nShut off the agricultural computer banks and the robos for good.\n\n\nWith good, clean land and nothing but their own limbs and brains to\nwork on, it may do them good in more than one way.\n\n\nThey just might start living again.\"   \n\n \n\n \" You may be right,\"  said Rin-Tak-Cy, the\nbubbling sociologist.\n\n\n  \" It just may work.\n\n\nOh come.\n\n\n do it.\"   \n\n \n\nThere were more deliberations.\n\n\nSome arguments.\n\n\nTechnical details of the operation worked out.\n\n\nRax-Gii and Tel-Xar tried to get the  reaction or\nopinion, but they remained blank and looked away.\n\n\nAt last the Vai-gans decided to go ahead with operation cleanup as\nthey dubbed it.\n\n\nIt didn't take them long to destroy the deceptive greenery.\n\n\nThey dumped whatever remained in the+\n\n\nThe Vai-gan technicians didn't have much difficulty in duping and\nsuccessfully shutting off the agricultural computer centres.\n\n\nThe Robos, stopped in their tracks.\n\n\nThe computers ceased to hum.\n\n\nEarth was free of the ubiquitous machines and their perennial\nbuzzing and whirring.\n\n\nIt was also clear of the poisons they had unwittingly spawned.\n\n\nThe oceans, the long suffering waste bin of the planet, once again\nbecame the receptacle of the filth of the lands, this time on a planetary\nscale.\n\n\nNiv-San-Ris did demur but Rax-Gii overruled him.\n\n\nThe Vai-gans were trying to help the dominant life form of the\nplanet to get on its feet again.\n\n\nThe bargain didn't include looking after their waters also. \n\n \n\nRax-Gii flapped his snowy white wings and wagged his scarlet\ntail in satisfaction at a job well done.\n\n\nRin-Cy touched wings with him in appreciation. \n\n \n\nThe Vai-gans looked down from the hovering spacecraft at the\nexpanse of the land they had stripped of the noxious tin plants.  <*>\nblack-square</*> <*> black-square</*> <call-out> \n\n\nThe Vai-gans were trying to help the dominant life form of the\nplanet to get on its feet again  </call-out> <*> black-square</*> <*>\nblack-square</*>\n\n \n\n  \" Well  up to them now.\n\n\nAll set and ready for takeover,\"   said Tel-Xar.\n\n\n \" Think  make it?\"  asked\nNiv-San-Ris. \n\n \n\n \" Oh, they should\"  , said Rin-Tac-Cy\nenthusiastically.\n\n\n  \" I think there must be many such groups scattered along\nall the coastlines.\n\n\nThey should gradually take over the land, now that there are no\nrobos to kill them, or the tin plants to maim them.\n\n\nIn due time, the human race should come back into its own again.\n\n\n a pity they are in a period of transition now, unable\nto communicate properly, otherwise they would have shown their gratitude.\"\n  \n\n \n\n \" Well, maybe  come back again someday\nafter the takeover to+ their thanks,\"  said Tel-Xar. \n\n  \" Perhaps,\"  mused Rax-Gii. \n\n \n\nWith one last look at the nearly scalped planet below, the\nVai-gans left in a blaze of fire and smoke, happy at having done their good\ndeed for the century. \n\n \n\nBelow, one of the humans -

{"text": "Need for planning in business  \n\n \n\nPlanning decides the future course of action in orderly manner.\n\n\nBusiness planning means using the techniques of planning in the\nbusiness operations.\n\n\nBusiness includes all the activities from production to marketing.\n\n\nThis  process of business must be done in orderly and\norganised i.e in    systematic   manner.\n\n\nBusiness without planning would not bring desired effects or would not\nachieve the objectives of a business in fairly manner. \n\n \n\nThe main objectives of a business ( every ) is to survive in the\nmarket.\n\n\nGrowth & expansion & recognition & to create prestige in the market.\n\n\nIf business is carried out without planning it will not bring desired\nresults but will    definitely   bring\nundesirable results.\n\n\nPlanning decides the future course of action of business by    considering   all factors, which can be    influenced      by  \naction.\n\n\nPlanning helps  the business in the following  \n ways.     \n\n \n\n1 Planning ( proper ) first analyses  the problem\nin the business correctly.\n\n\nPlanning decides or finds the    severity \n of the problem.\n\n\nHow that particular problem will be solved ?\n\n\nHow    that   problem will affect the\nbusiness activities etc. \n\n \n\nThen,  planning decides the objective  of a business by\ndetermining or stating clear objective.\n\n\n   Planning   helps the workers or\nemployees to achieve that object by cooperation, co-ordination.\n\n\nIf the    workers   or employees know\nthe object of the business correctly and in clear way they can work easily\n or in particular way to secure the object. \n\n\n  3 Planning premises  : \n\n \n\nPlanning also includes same       i.e. electricity will be there to work the\nmachine etc.\n\n \n\nThus, planning decides what to do, How to do, when to do and who\nis to do it.\n\n\nThus, planning answers the four questions  :  \n\n \n\n1) What to do, i.e. what is the object of business.\n\n\n   Which   business wants to achieve.\n\n\nWhy we are working ? \n\n \n\n2) How to do ?\n\n\nPlanning also    answers   this question\ni.e.    in   what manner, procedure we should\nachieve the object of the business decided in answer  what to do\n . \n\n \n\n3    Then   proper planning also\ndecides the time or period or proper time to the proper action in    deciding   the object and also answers the question\n who will do it  i.e. to achieve the goal of a business\n who will do the particular work, act etc.  \n\n \n\nThus, if the business is carried out without the planning answer\nto all the above    questions   will not be\ngiven  which are the important questions  .\n\n\n And because the employees or workers will not be\nknowing why business is carried out i.e  the  object.\n\n\nProper procedure & time for action and the work specialisation will\nnot be possible and business will not work efficiently, smoothly and main\nobjects of every business i.e to make profit  will be lost  .\n\n\n   Survival   in the market growth,\nrecognition, status et  cannot be achieved because of\nabsence of planning. \n\n \n\nSo for smooth working of business proper planning should be there\nfrom the production to marketing.\n\n\nBecause  of  planning we can come to  know where we are to\nwhere we want to go.   \n\n \n\n\n   \" Profit is the primary objective of a business\"\n  \n\n \n\n Yes. \n\n\nIn   world market profit is the primary\nobjective of business but not the only objective of business.\n\n\nAll business activities are aimed at making the profit or to earn\nmaximum profit.\n\n\nThe main objective of all business is to maximise the profit by\nreducing the cost of production.\n\n\nThe main purpose or goal of  business is to earn\nmaximum profit.\n\n\nBut there are some organisations or   \ninstitutions   which are carried out for social    objectives.  \n\n\nIn the past profit is the main, primary, i.e. very 1st but also the\nonly objective of business, the producers or manufacturers only aims at\nmaximising profits through    exploitation \n .\n\n\n   They   did not bother about the social\n   effects   or objectives of the business.\n\n\nThey only    want   to earn profit.\n\n\nBut  world market is a consumer oriented, all\nthe activities are carried out for the consumer.\n\n\nThis does not mean that the aim of  business\norganisation is to earn    profit alone.  \n\n\nToday also the primary objective of business is to make\nmaximum profit but this is not  only objective of business.\n\n\nThus in  market producers earn profit but they are\ncertainly not allowed for  profiteering.\n\n\nThey also    perform   secondary\nobject i.e. social object because  ( business ) is\nan economic organisation & social    institution\n  . \n\n \n\n   Thus,   profit must be main & the\nvery first objective of a business because without profit    no businessman   can survive in the market.\n\n\nThus, for surviving, growth and    expansion\n  profit must be primary object of the business but not a\nprofiteering.\n\n\n   The   people     definitely   will not allow to earn\nextra-ordinary, profit by exploiting consumer, & workers.\n\n\nThus, it is true & correct to have a profit as the primary objective.\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBusiness combinition means simply combining the units which   were  engaged in a same production activity or which\nmay be in different production    line for  \nsome common interests.\n\n\nThe business combinition means  come together and become one\npart of the business  . \n\n \n\nThus, business combinition means combining the units to take\nadvantage or for a common goal, interest etc. \n\n\n  Causes of business combinitions  : -  \n\n\n 1)  Avoiding cut-throat   \ncompetition    : - \n\n \n\nMany business units come together to avoid cut-throat competition\nand also a    wasteful competition. \n\n\n\n   Thus   it helps to the small\norganisation to survive in the market by joining the other business.\n\n\nUnnecessary and unhealthy    competition\n  are    wasteful competition. \n\n\n\n   They   do not help any    competition,   therefore, business combination\ntakes place. \n\n\n 2)  price-cutting policy  : - \n\n \n\nIf there are    a number   of\nbusiness units carried out same business in the same market\nprice-cutting is    easily   done.\n\n\nBecause, consumer gets the substitute and the value of every item can\n   easily   be   \nbargained.  \n\n\nThus, by combining units they may decide to charge the uniform prices\nto    avoid   the price cutting.\n\n\n 3)  To create monopoly  : - \n\n \n\nMonopoly business has got several advantages.\n\n\nSo all the procedures    aim   at creating\nmonopoly by combining different units into one unit.\n\n\nThus, by creating monopoly producers are free to charge any price.\n\n\n\n 4)  Growth,    expansion  \n : - \n\n \n\nBy combining the units, one big organisation can  take\nplace and to that one big organisation growth and   \nexpansion   of business is possible, in order to raise funds,\nincreasing production capacity, etc. \n\n\n 5)  Preference or desire for bigness  : \n\n\nBig organisation has got some special status or many    producers   like to have or they desire for big\norganisation therefore they join the others. \n\n\n 6)  Specialisation of work  : \n\n \n\nWork specialisation is possible in big organisations because of\nnumber of workers work there.\n\n\nBy specialisation of work quality of product can be improved. \n\n\n 7)  Expert management  : \n\n \n\nExpert management of business or planning of business\ntransactions through experts is possible only in big firms.\n\n\nAs they can afford to pay the expert to manage or to plant their\nbusiness activities. \n\n\n 8)  Credit    worthiness  \n : \n\n \n\nCredit    worthiness   is more\nin case of big organisations.\n\n\nBanks or many financial institutions are ready to give credit to big\norganisations.\n\n\nThus, raising the finance is not a problem in case of big\norganisations.\n\n\nThey can also raise the finance from the profit earned previously.\n\n\n\n 9)  Economies of large scale production  : \n\n\nEvery    businessman   desires or\nwants to enjoy large scale production ( Economies ) .\n\n\nBy combining units it is possible to produce,    distribute   on large scale and to enjoy the economies of\nlarge scale production such as discount on purchasing raw material, credit\nfacilities etc. \n\n\n 10)  Trade cycles  : \n\n \n\nThe risk involved in a big organisation is big or more but it is\ndevided to many number of workers, employees or shareholders.\n\n\nTherefore, individual only suffer the loss, to his extent and the\nburden of loss or risk do not fall on few members or persons.\n\n\nAnd business organisations ( big ) can easily   \nfight   with the trade cycles i.e. inflation,    depression   in the market, Govt policies etc. \n\n \n\n   Because   of all the\nadvantages busines  combinition takes place.  \n\n \n\n\n   \" Locational planning is an important aspect of\nbusiness planning\"   \n\n \n\nBusiness planning means  using planning techniques in the\nbusiness activities  .\n\n\n   Profitability   and efficiency\nof business  mainly depends upon the location of a plant i.e.\n\" where the plant or organisation is situated, established \" .\n\n\n   If   it is not situated in a proper place\nor region then it will    definitely   fail\nto bring the desired effects or to achieve the goals.\n\n\nTherefore, while preparing the planning or \nlocation factor must be considered i.e \" where or which is the proper\nplace to start the business \" .\n\n\nBecause if the location is not considered in the planning  though the planning is very good but planning will also fail to bring\nthe desired effect.\n\n\nThus, it is an essential item to be considered while preparing the\nbusiness planning.\n\n\nThus, location is a very important factor or aspect of business\nplanning.\n\n\nBecause, planning  is  done    without\n  taking into account location  it  will  \n defeat   the purpose of planning. \n\n\n  Regional factors   \n\n\n 1)  nearness to the raw materials  : \n\n \n\nOrganisation or business must be situated at the place where the\n raw materials of or production can easily  be \navailable.\n\n\nIf the business is situated far from the source of raw material it\nwill increase the production cost.\n\n\nThus if while making the plan if  location factor\nwould not    be considered   it will increase\nthe cost of production. \n\n\n 2)  nearness to the market  : \n\n \n\n   Business   should be situated\nnear or not very far from the market    because \n if the business is situated far from the market it will increase the\ndistribution cost. \n\n\n 3)  Transport facilities  : \n\n \n\nThe business should be situated in a place where transportation\nfacilities are well developed.\n\n\nIf the transportation facilities are not developed in the region\nwhere the business is situated it will  delay in bringing raw\nmaterial, distributing the finished goods to market etc. \n\n\n 4)  Availability of labour  : \n\n \n\nWhile planning, the    planner  \nshould also consider the location because if the business is situated where\nthe labour supply is not    adequate   or not\nsufficient and also not cheap then it will not  be  desirable.\n\n\nTherefore, business must  be  situated where the  labour supply is    adequate   and\ncheap. \n\n\n 5)  Availability of natural resources  : \n\n \n\nMaterial resources must be available mainly water, where the\nbusiness is to be    started.  \n\n\n   If   the natural resources are not\navailable in the region adequately or sufficiently the business will not work\n   smoothly   & efficiently. \n\n \n\n6) The main and very important factor while planning\nthe business  with reference to the location is the location of\nbusiness.\n\n\n It  must be in proper place where the organisation or\nindustry can easily    throw   out    its   pollutants - - items like water,  noise, then air\npollution  etc., in    safe way  \nwithout harming anybody.\n\n\n   The   industry should not be situated in\na place where it cannot    throw   out the\nitems ( pollutants )    safely because  \nthey are harmful    to   the health of the people.\n\n\n\n  locality   \n\n \n\nThe business should be situated in the proper locality i.e.\naccording to the nature of product and  the living standard\nor style of living of people.\n\n\nFor  example  : If the car manufacturing industry or T.V.\nmanufacturing industry is situated or starts the business in    villages   it will   \ndefinitely   not be proper    because  \nthe living standard or knowledge or the importance for the product of the\npeople in village is  low i.e. they do not afford to buy this\nluxurious items.\n\n\nAnd    because   they do not afford\nthey do not have any importance or need for that product. \n\n \n\nThus, while preparing or in the process of business planning\nlocation factor is very important otherwise if  \n planner neglects   or do not consider the location factor it will\nbring some problems or undesirable effects which are harmful to the business\nsuch as, increase in cost of production, distribution, delay in production\nand distribution of finished goods, labour scarcity, insufficient natural\nresources ie. unfavourable climate conditions,  which are  harmful to\npeople    because   of pollution, and also\nwastage.\n\n\n   If a   business is not situated in a\nproper place i.e. scarcity of consumers or extra expenditure to increase or\ncreate demand for

{"text": "Celebrating the Essay  \n\n\nby DARSHAN SINGH MAINI  \n\n \n\n Though  the essay as a distinct literary genre has\nbeen courted and coveted by some of the greatest writers of the English\nlanguage, it has never quite attained its rightful place in the community of\nletters.\n\n\nWhile the poem, the novel, and the play walk into the parlor, or mount\nthe podium, as if it is their privilege, the essay is often treated as a poor\nrelation come in from the cold.\n\n\nNo wonder, it has  en route  sought hospitality\nwithin the folds of the novel, the memoir, or the autobiography, and led a\nfairly nomadic, shy, furtive, or vicarious existence. \n\n \n\nOf course, ever since Frenchman Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, who\nis still regarded as the  putative father, the pure essayists\nhave struggled to keep its special credentials in order, wedded as they are\nto a vision of the  freedom.\n\n\nBut for most novelists and poets, the essay has been a by-blow of\nsorts.\n\n\nIronically, for that very reason, it has attained a raffish charm.\n\n\nEither way, it has managed to survive despite frequent notices\nabout its impending demise.\n\n\nFor, if the essay is  \" an enactment of the creation of the\nself,\"  as O.B. Hardison argues in a recent defense of the embattled\ngenre, then it has a constitutive franchise, or an existential lease. \n\n \n\n Major Modern Essayists   *  presents some of\nthe most impressive and eloquent essays of our times.\n\n\nAlthough meant chiefly for the American college student,  the  appeal extends to the essay addict\nand the cognoscente alike.\n\n\nIt is truly a beaufiful house of words, assembled block by block,\nand furnished with delicate care, taste, and understanding. \n\n \n\nIn his preface Professor Gilbert H. Muller, the \neditor, has set down the parameters of the exercise.\n\n\nThe collection reveals a distinctive aesthetic at work in relation\nto the format and the economy of the enterprise.\n\n\nIt confines itself to 20th-century writers - - from Virginia Woolf\nto Annie Dillard - - and offers a rich, varied, and generous fare - -  \"\na variety of voices, rhetorical modes, and prose forms.\"  \n\n \n\nThe essays included in this volume come from such diverse areas\nof study as history, art, literature, ecology, science, medicine, philosophy,\nlinguistics, and sports, thus encompassing almost the entire spectrum of\nmodern life, thought, and aesthetic.\n\n\nThe 20 essayists - - ten men and ten women - - are drawn from Great\nBritain, the United States, Canada, and Africa, and represent white,\nblack, Hispanic, and American-Chinese cultures.\n\n\nEach is fielded with three to five pieces of prose to bring out the\naroma and ambience of his or her work.\n\n\nA very thoughtful and efficient presentation but I was disappointed\nto find no Indian writer here despite the fact that India produces the third\nlargest volume of literature in English in the world.\n\n\nEven more mystifying is the omission of other Commonwealth writers\nsuch as V.S. Naipaul and George Lamming.\n\n\nThe kind of colonial experience they represent, and the kind of\nEnglish they have evolved to render the agony and irony of their\nsituation, cannot simply be found in other texts and contexts. \n\n \n\nIn a critique of this size and nature, it is not possible to take\nup each individual essayist, and bring out the virtues of his or her prose in\nterms of thought, signature, and style.\n\n\nNor is there any room for adequate illustrations.\n\n\nThe difficulty is compounded where some pieces and passages, like\nperiod wines, yield their taste and flavor in slow, measured sips, and one\nhas to savor long periods of prose to register their presence.\n\n\nI propose, therefore, to touch on some known classics, and on a\ncouple of new American voices that have lifted prose to a level where it\npleases and charms, compels and holds. \n\n \n\nTo set Virginia Woolf at the head of the table is to recall\nappropriately her celebrated ( and much misunderstood) statement:\n \" Human nature changed in or about December 1910,\"  which,\nthough formulated in the context of the Parisian Cubists and Surrealists,\ndefined strikingly a certain shift in modern sensibility, and in the ways of\nappropriating experience for art.\n\n\nThe volume under review purports, above all, to show this aspect\nthrough some of the profoundest moments of modern prose.\n\n\n essays included here-  \" Professions for\nWomen,\"   \" The Death of the Moth,\"  and  \"\nMiddlebrow\"  - - illustrate the resilience of the domesticated gypsy\ngenre, for the essays in question are in the form of a public address, a\nseries of  \" dispersed meditations\"  ( \ndefinition of the essay), and a public letter in that order. \n\n\nHer style accordingly is, in turn, chatty, witty, and conversational;\ngraphic, vivid, and figurative; puckish, fey, and mocking. \n\n \n\nOur next port of call is E.B. White, who almost created the\nmodern American essay out of the proven energies and felicities of the\nAmerican tongue.\n\n\n \" The New Yorker \"  style, which he\nfashioned and honed into an instrument of precision, control, and dry wit,\nsubsuming conversational latencies, has become a modish American model for\nhigh-profile magazine writing in English everywhere.\n\n\nAs an essayist, White truly divined the purpose of the light essay as\nan evocation of  \" the small things of the day, the trivial matters of\nthe heart.\" \n\n\n where the essay and the short story come closest to\neach other, for each deals, in essence, with  \" significant\ninsignificances,\"  and each makes a song out of marginalities and\nmemorabilia, even as each seeks to convey some profound truths.\n\n\nIn his long and delightful essay.\n\n\n \" The Ring of Time,\"  in which White describes the\nsheer magic of the circus, and the nostalgia of those visits, the reader is,\nalong with the writer, rolling, cavorting, freewheeling, and trapezing over\nthe artifacts of language:  \n\n \n\nThe  gaze, as she peered straight ahead, seemed\nto be circular <*> dotted line</*> then time itself began running in circles,\nand so the beginning was where the end was, and the two were the same <*>\ndotted line</*>.\n\n\nEverything in her movements, her expression, told you that for her\nthe ring of time was perfectly formed, changeless, predictable, without\nbeginning or end, like the ring in which she was traveling at this moment\nwith the horse that wallowed under her.\n\n\nAnd then I slipped back into my trance, and time was circular again-\ntime, pausing quietly with the rest of us, so as not to disturb the balance\nof a performer.  \n\n \n\nFor those who can overhear the echoes from T.S. Eliot and recall\nthe metaphor of the ring from 17th-century metaphysical poets, an essay of\nthis kind becomes a treat for the mind. \n\n \n\nGeorge Orwell, who was something of a secular visionary and the\nconscience of a troubled race, is represented here by his much anthologized\nessays such as  \" A Hanging,\"   \" Shooting an\nElephant,\"   \" Politics and the English Language,\" \n \" The Moon under Water,\"  and  \" Why I Write.\"\n\n\n\nThese and several similar pieces have come to stay as classic\nexamples of plate glass and reflexive prose.\n\n\nThe main features of this prose are a controlled, nervious, and\nefficient style, a freshness of idiom and metaphor, an organic development\nof thought, a concreteness of detail, a precision of statement, and a strong\nmoral, Protestant vein.\n\n\nAnd over the whole exercise presides a fine, subtle, and noble\nimagination - - the imagination of  \" sincerity and authenticity.\"\n\n\n\nIn employing Lionel  terms \nreminded of the fact that the American  great admiration for\nOrwell rested, among other things, upon the Orwellian  \" No, in\nThunder\"  to all shams and hypocrisies, and all cant and casuistry.\n\n\nNo wonder, in  own words,  \" the imagination,\nlike certain wild animals, will not breed in captivity.\"  \n\n \n\nFrom Orwell to James Baldwin is only a leap from color and\ncontinent to a similar sensibility, for despite their different\nbackgrounds, and situations and their worldview, each of them was\npassionately and vigilantly devoted to the idea of truth as he saw it, and\nto the search for a corresponding rhetoric and style.\n\n\nAnd this is why each voice, in its own context, rings so truly, so\nresonantly, and so movingly.\n\n\n prose is today widely recognized as a glorious\nexample of American writing marked by a sense of classical dignity and\nvitality, and by a rhetoric of thunder, dream, and prophecy.\n\n\nThe underlying grid of this rhetoric is fed continually by four\ndistinct, though converging, lines of energy - - Shakespeare, the \nKing James Bible  , Negro spirituals, and Harlem slang.\n\n\nThe themes of his essays include abused childhood and street terrors,\nracial destiny and existential suffering, problems of identity and\nalienation, and moral and linguistic imperialism.\n\n\nThese themes, to be sure, are  common to nearly\nall writers of the Harlem Renaissance, but in Baldwin the issues become\ninvested with a strange visionary force.\n\n\nBaldwin, the novelist, is often a conscious  \" Jamesian\"\n in his prose, but Baldwin, the essayist, is more Orwellian in the\nfinal analysis. \n\n \n\nFrom James Baldwin to Martin Luther King, Jr., black American\nprose follows a path of spiritual and moral polemic which, in some hands,\nrises to a great song of sorrow in clear Biblical accents.\n\n\nBut before I come to King I wish to salute some other talents that\nmake up the matrix of this insightful anthology: Barbara Tuchman, for whom\nhistory was a creative art, and the historian an artist in his own domain\n( see page 39), Lewis Thomas, who writes on American science with such\nprecision, wit, and eloquence; Doris Lessing, whose African-colonial\nbackground makes her a white crusader committed to human dignity and\nheroism; Russell Baker, an American humorist of pure vintage whose\nessay  \" The Flag\"  is a deliciious and delicate satire\nreminiscent of Mark Twain; Richard Selzer, who in  \" The Pen and the\nScalpel\"  ( published in \" SPAN \" , July 1989)\nbrings a  experience to bear upon the craft of writing;\nEdward Hoagland, who talks of the essay as a wild thing out of the jungle\nwhose surface  \" generates sparks, like a cat of fur\"  ; Joan\nDidion, who in the opinion of James Dickey is  \" the finest woman\nprose stylist writing in the English language today\"  ; Joyce Carol\nOates, who is emerging as  voice of culture and keeper of\nconscience; Alice Walker, who at her best represents black feminine aesthetic\nin America in an idiom of great power; and Annie Dillard, whose essays rise\nabove the din and dust of the native scene to claim her American heritage of\nrespect for life, and for its evocation of the beautiful, the sacred, and the\nheroic. \n\n \n\nAnd, so finally, I come to King-  \" every inch a king\"\n of poetry and pathos.\n\n\nHis living classic,  \" I Have a Dream,\"  is\npresented as an example of American prose on the peaks.\n\n\nA most moving and powerful piece, it was written as much out of\nthe solar plexus as out of a politico-religious vision of austere beauty and\nelegance.\n\n\nIts  repetitive spoken pattern, its\nhaunting, evangelical rhythm, its urgency and eloquence, its visionary and\nstriking new phrases, among many of its other virtues, help make a prose\nstyle that comes closest to being a   stilus   .\n\n\nThe Greek word indicates the lapidary aspect of such a prose, for\nKing uses his rhetoric as an instrument to cut the stones of experience to\nproper proportions.\n\n\nEven more powerful in some ways is his long and great  \"\nLetter from Birmingham City Jail\"  to the ever-pliable elders and\nbetters of his church. \n\n \n\nTo conclude, the  natural gaiety and inner\neconomy account for its undiminished vitality.\n\n\nAs the French word,   essai   , the Latin\n  exagium   , and the English  essay \nsuggest, it is a genre that continually solicits effort and exertions and\nstrivings.\n\n\nTo try, to test, to dart forth, to light out - - that, in sum,\nconstitutes its being and becoming.\n\n\nThe essay, then, is linked to the imagination on the prowl, turning\nover any small object, place, or person that may, with luck, yield a\nmeasure of music.  <*> small square</*> \n\n\n *  Major Modern Essayists  , edited by Gilbert H.\nMullet, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1991, pp. 476,\npaperback,\n\n$24.  \n\n\n About the Author:   Darshan Singh Maini, a\nChandigarh-based writer, has been a professor of English at the Punjabi\nUniversity in Patiala and a visiting professor at New York University.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "67c87714-0b18-4e3b-91cb-697ec78eb7dc", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.035121+00:00"}
{"text": "Exports of Agricultural Produce - - Problems & Prospects \n\n\n  Introduction  : \n\n \n\nThe organisation of Indian agriculture has been based on\nindividual farming under the system of peasant proprietorship.\n\n\nNo attempt has been made in India to deliberately shift the terms of\ntrade against agriculture.\n\n\nFurther, owing to the persistence of imbalances between the supply and\ndemand for agricultural commodities, particularly food grains, the terms of\ntrade have continued to be favourable to agriculture throughout the greater\npart of the plan period including the first decade of the green revolution.\n\n\nAlso, because of growing influence of farmers the farm subsidies have\nbeen increasing continuously resutling in the enfeeblement of the  capacity to make productive investments in agriculture.\n\n\nThe rise in subsidies on irrigation and fertilisers has induced the\nallocation of resources in favour of crops like \" wheat \"\nand \" rice \" resulting in the achievement of\nself-sufficiency in foodgrains. \n\n \n\nIndian agriculture has played and continues to play a very\nimportant role in the development of the country.\n\n\nIt has been contributing substantially to crucial foreign exchange\nearnings for the country.\n\n\nMajor agricultural and allied products exported are \" tea,\ncoffee, rice, raw cotton, tobacco, cashew kernels, spices, oil meal, fruits\n\" and \" vegetables, processed fruits, juices \" and\nmiscellaneous processed items, marine products, sugar and molasses and meat\nand meat preparations.\n\n\nThe value of exports of these products has increased substantially in\nthe last 25 years.\n\n\nThe exports in 1970-71 aggregated Rs. 487  crores  ,\naccounting for 31.7 per cent of the total exports by value ( Table 1).\n\n\nExports of agriculltural and allied products continued to rise in\n rupee  terms   to\nreach a figure of  Rs.  8,791  crores  in\n1992-93.\n\n\nIn fact the share of the agricultural produce in total exports has\ncontinued to decline, and stood at around 17 per cent in 1992-93. \n\n \n\nItemwise, the major items to earn fairly substantial foreign\nexchange through exports have been cotton yarn and manufactures, earning\n Rs.  75  crores  in 1970-71 and  Rs.\n 3,929  crores  in 1992-93 ( Table 2).  \n\n \n\nTea has also been a major foreign exchange earner,\ncontributing  Rs.  148  crores  in 1970-71\nto  Rs.  1212  crores  in 199-92, with a slight\nfall in 1992-93 to  Rs.  973  crores  .\n\n\n earnings through foreign trade have witnessed\nsteady increase from  Rs.  25  crores  in\n1970-71 to  Rs.  366  crores  in 1992-93. \n\n \n\nThe performance of Cashew Kernel exports also has been\nremarkable.\n\n\nThe total value of exports increased from  Rs.  33\n crores  in 1970-71 to  Rs.  749  crores\n in 1992-93.\n\n\nFruits and vegetables earned a total of  Rs.  361\n crores  in 1992-93, and spices in the same year accounted for\n Rs.  369  crores  . \n\n \n\nIt has been noticed that the exports of primary products lately\nhave declined in US dollar terms by 8.6 percent resulting in a fall in the\nshare of agricultural produce in total exports.\n\n\nThe major decline under primary products were recorded in tea ( 31.7\npercent ) .\n\n\nThe target, as per the Eighth Five Year Plan and Union Ministry of\nCommerce for the agricultural sector for the year 1993-94 is a growth of 18.4\n% over its earlier performance. \n\n \n\nExports of agricultural produce ( including Cotton & Jute\nmanufactures ) as a proportion of GDP at factor cost have lowered around\ntwo percent or less for the years 1980-81 to 1992-93. \n\n\nIn fact, agricultural exports as a proportion of total value of\nagricultural production in the country do not go beyond 7 percent, and have\nremained either six percent or below for most of the years in the last decade\n( Table 3 and 4 ) .\n\n\nThus there appears to be a fairly small and constant proportion of\nthe  agricultural exports. \n\n \n\nIt may however be remembered that world agricultural trade occurs\nin a highly imperfect setting where world prices are determined by relatively\nsmall surplus and deficits which enter world trade and do not necessarily\ninfluence world consumption and production particularly where tariff barriers\ncontinue to be imposed by the developed and the developing worlds.\n\n\nThus world prices can change substantially even with small changes\nin production. \n\n \n\nAlthough India is a fairly large producer and consumer of\nagricultural commodities by world standards,  share is\nmarginal as far as international trade in these commodities is concerned.\n\n\nAccording to estimates of UNCTAD, India produce about 10 percent of\nthe world agricultural output, but her share in world trade in agricultural\ncommodities has been around 0.6 percent.\n\n\nIt will therefore be seen that the share of  exports\nin World trade would be still much smaller.\n\n\nFurther  involvement in world agricultural trade has\nbeen declining during the past 25 years whether this is measured in\ncomparison with world agricultural trade,  international\ntrade or her GDP.\n\n\nThus Indian imports & exports of agricultural commodities have\ndeclined as a share of a) world trade, b)  own total trade\nand c) her national income.\n\n\nThese shares have declined more than the share of agricultural sector\nor of foreign trade in  GDP. \n\n \n\nThe not so rosy picture of  foreign trade in\nagricultural products is a fairly true reflection of the  ` food\nsecurity and self sufficiency'  policy adopted by the country since\nmid-sixties.\n\n\nThe gradual fall in exports of agricultural products can be\nexplained by the fact that the  ` Green revolution'  while\nreducing the supply deficit of food grains did not lead to a generation of\nexportable surpluses.\n\n\nThe emphasis had been on the greater production of cereals and as a\nconsequence the possibility of exporting greater quantities and of\ndiversifying exports of agricultural products took a back policy seat. \n\n\n  Problems & Potential  \n\n \n\nThe Indian Government has introduced policy changes recently\nwhich are normally summarised in the terms used - - liberalisation and\nglobalisation.\n\n\nFairly substantial hopes have been raised with regard to the\nimprovenment in the working of the economy and therefore in increasing the\n ` all-round'  efficiency.\n\n\nThe managers of the agricultural sector in India tend to envisage an\nimproved and an increased role for this sector both in the domestic economy\nand the trade sector.\n\n\nIt would be pertinent to evaluate the prospects of Indian\nagricultural trade - - particularly the exports.\n\n\nA study of relative prices in the international market and Indian\nagricultural market over a period of time has shown that both domestic and\ninternational prices grew more or less at the same rate until mid-1980s but\nsince then the export prices have increased quite substantially.\n\n\nThus changes or movements in domestic prices particularly since\n1980s, have tended to favour importables as against exportables among\nagricultural commodities. \n\n \n\nIt must also be emphasised that the  ` planning' \nfor a greater role for Indian agriculture in  foreign trade\nmust be seen in the backdrop of less stable agricultural world market.\n\n\nIn fact, the projections show that prices of Indian agricultural\nproducts - - traditional export items among them - - have been and would be\nmuch higher than the world prices of these products.\n\n\nSome of these products are \" rice, groundnut, cotton, jute,\ntea, coffee, tobacco, pepper, bananas \" etc.\n\n\nFurther, world price indices for agricultural commodities available\nfrom the World Bank and UNCTAD show a sharp adverse movement against such\ncommodities in their terms of trade with manufactured goods.\n\n\nAccording to these sources, between 1980 and 1990, in dollar terms,\nagricultural commodity prices fell by around 30 percent while prices of\nmanufactured goods rose by 35 percent.  \n\n \n\nIndia accounts for a fairly large share of world agricultural\noutput.\n\n\nHistorically, in the present times, a relatively small proportion of\nworld output in the agricultural sector enters world trade for most\nagricultural commodities.\n\n\nThus, if India had to enter such a market with its  `\nexportables'  , the result would be a   \nworsening   of the terms of trade of agricultural commodities.\n\n\nFor  ` importable'  commodities, liberalisation would\nincrease domestic    competition   thereby\nmaking domestic production uneconomical and finally   \nending   up with reduced domestic production and higher prices.\n\n\nThe traditional items have low demand and supply elasticities and as\na consequence there would be very little available for the export market.\n\n\nIndia has real export potential in the development of horticulture\nand food processing.\n\n\nIn fact floricultural, horticultural, trade potential in the world is\nestimated to be growing at the rate  of  30 % per year.\n\n\nIndia, with its  ` varied agro-climatic'  conditions\nand a huge variety of horticultural products can benefit substantially from\nthis ever growing world demand.\n\n\nIndia can produce value-added products which would also help the\ngrowth of the    agro-based   industries in\nthe country.\n\n\nBut any success in this area must perforce demand strict production,\npackaging, wrapping techniques; and will call for immense efforts in the\nfield of international marketing.\n\n\nThere is a huge potential to be tapped, but there are stiff  `\nconditions'  to be met thus stringent sanitary and phyto-sanitary\nmeasures would have to be ensured.\n\n\nIndia can, with some effort, export several horticultural products\nlike banana,  litchi, chikoo, ber,  pomegranates, custard\napples, etc.\n\n\nIndia enjoys an advantage in terms of quality of many of these\nfruits.\n\n\nThe vegetables in which India can manage to have an edge over other\ncountries in the export market include onion, chilli, and some seasonal\nvegetables. \n\n \n\nThere is a further substantial potential in the cultivation and\nexports of products, which are mainly medicinal in nature on the  Neem\n tree.\n\n\nResearch has indicated that this tree has a vast potential to meet\nthe increasing requirements of the field of medicine.\n\n\nIndia is uniquely placed to produce large quantitites of this tree\nand export its detracted products.\n\n\nThe tree can grow anywhere and as a consequence a dual purpose of\nincreasing exports and of meeting environmental ( Social forestry )\nrequirements will be met. \n\n \n\nThe progress in meeting export requirements of agricultural\nproducts would depend upon how efficiently the country produces these\nproducts and how it manages to overcome the  \" Whims\"  of the\nworld market.\n\n\nThe country should go in for production for the international market,\nand not depend upon the surplus from the domestic market.\n\n\nThis calls for specialised studies in international markets and\nmarketing and continuous research and development efforts on the part of\nIndian Agriculture. <*> dotted line from left to right </*>  **1\n\n\nThis has serious

I greatly appreciate what you are doing for their\nbetterment,\"  one day  Begum  Haseeb told  friend, Mahmood.\n\n\n  \" But why don't you ask the Hindu boys and girls also to\njoin you?\"   \n\n \n\n  \" Hindus will tell them to learn Hindi while we teach\nUrdu to these illiterate folk.\n\n\nThere is no arrangement for learning Urdu,\"   Mahmood\nreplied.\n\n\nHe was a handsome youth,

opened just for the purpose of teaching Hindi.\n\n\nNo Urdu books were being published and many Urdu magazines and\nnewspapers had closed down.\n\n\nEven the Urdu newspapers that were in existence

had not put their\nfoot down he would not have allowed Pakistan to come into existence.\n\n\nHe was the one who created all the trouble for the Indian Muslims.\n\n\nHe always has a Muslim stooge at his beck and call - an Azad, a\nKidwai or a Zakir Husain.\n\n\nHis intention is to keep the Indian Muslims on the leash.\n\n\nHe is out to snatch away their language and fiddle with their jobs.\n\n\nAs for trade and industry Muslims have already been sidelined.\n\n\nIn course of time they would despite themselves be carried away by\nthe Hindu stream.\n\n\nThis is one way of breaking the backbone of a nation.\"  \n\n\n \n\n \" I am not sure I understand what you want to say,\"\n  Begum  Haseeb looked at him confused. \n\n \n\n  \"  Ammijan  , they are teaching Hindi\nto your daughter at school.\n\n\nToday Zeba is more proficient in Hindi than in Urdu.\n\n\nShe folds her hands and says  namaste  to everyone.\n\n\nI don't see her bowing her head and saying  adaab  .\n\n\nThere was a time when they used to broadcast  naats \nand  hamzas  ,  qawwalis  and  ghazals\n from the Lucknow radio station.\n\n\nToday you hardly hear an Urdu programme over the radio.\n\n\nThe language of the news broadcast from All India Radio is becoming\nmore and more unfamiliar as the days pass.\n\n\nThe other day someone was saying that these radio people do not\nbroadcast news in Hindi but they propagate Hindi in the news.\n\n\nSo far as I am concerned I fail to make much sense of our news\nbulletins.\n\n\nEvery morning and evening I make it a point to tune in to Pakistan\nRadio for the  news.\"   \n\n \n\nAs Mahmood took out a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe his\nface a wad of hundred-rupee notes came out and fell on the floor.\n\n\nHe quickly picked up the packet and put it back into his pocket.\n\n\nThen he got up to go.\n\n\nA car had come to fetch him.\n\n\nIt was a big, shiny limousine, with a young boy at the wheel.\n\n\nThere were other boys and girls in the car.  \u00d4\n\n\nSince that day  Begum  Haseeb had relented towards\nZeba.\n\n\nThe girl was all the time collecting books on Islam and Pakistan.\n\n\nThe Urdu programmes from Lahore radio station were most attractive.\n\n\nShe tuned in to these programmes morning and evening and listened\nin to them along with her  Ammi  . \n\n \n\nThese days  Begum  Haseeb drew great comfort by\nlistening to the Quran Shareef broadcast from the Lahore radio station.\n\n\nSo many troubles had assailed her all at one time.\n\n\nRecitation of  name gave her great solace.\n\n\nOnce she sat down to listen to those  qawwalis  and\nhymns, she found it difficult to tear herself away from the radio.\n\n\nIn contrast, All India Radio was such a bore - mostly singing of\nclassical music, news read in unintelligible Hindi or broadcasts relating to\nnational development projects.\n\n\nAll this just passed over her head. \n\n \n\nAt long last there was a letter from Lahore from Ismet which had\ncome by hand.\n\n\nZeba spluttered with rage as she read the letter.\n\n\nThe Amritsar police had not permitted the Recovery squad coming from\nLahore to arrest Seema.\n\n\nThe contingent had taken away truckloads of abducted Muslim girls\nfrom Amritsar proper and from neighbouring villages.\n\n\nBut the local police had not allowed them to visit \nhouse, their plea being that nobody could have abducted a graduate girl\nagainst her wishes.\n\n\nBesides,  mother was still living in India.\n\n\nThe  brother might be living in London but he was\nstill a citizen of India.\n\n\nThey had property worth  lakhs  of rupees in Meerut.\n\n\nAfter the formation of Pakistan no member of their family had\nmigrated to Pakistan.\n\n\nNo doubt they had some relations there but they had been living\nthere long before Pakistan came into existence.\n\n\nIsmet had written in her letter:   \" My husband is not one\nto admit defeat so easily.\n\n\nHe has planned with a member of the Pakistani police to bring back\nSeema forcibly with the next batch of abducted girls.\n\n\nOnce she crosses the border we shall manage the rest.\" \n\n\n\nIsmet was confident that her husband would succeed in his mission.\n\n\n \n\nBut it seemed that success had again eluded her.\n\n\nAs days passed  hope receded.\n\n\nIt appeared they had\u00d4 an iron wall around Seema which none could\ndemolish.\n\n\nNo one could lay hands upon her.\n\n\nShe had even stopped writing to her mother.\n\n\nIn fact  Begum  Haseeb herself wanted to break off\nall connections with Seema.\n\n\nShe had developed a prejudice against her.\n\n\nFor the last few days she had been struggling with the doubt that\nmaybe her late husband had been following the wrong trail and there was truth\nin what her younger daughter was dinning into her ears day in and day out.\n\n\nHer doubts were enhanced by the other young men and girls who\nregularly visited her house and tried to brainwash her. \n\n \n\nThen the doctor who was treating  Sheikh  Shabbir\nsuggested that he should be sent to Pakistan.\n\n\nMaybe that would put the  Sheikh  in a proper frame\nof mind and lead to his cure.\n\n\nEven  Begum  Haseeb sometimes toyed with the idea of\nmigrating to Pakistan.\n\n\nLet the property go to hell.\n\n\nThe more important thing was to keep body and soul together for\nwhich she had enough money.\n\n\nShe felt that if she stayed on in India she might also lose her\nbalance like her brother-in-law.\n\n\nThe pendulum of her life was already swinging violently between\nIndia and Pakistan. \n\n \n\n Begum  Haseeb felt utterly confused \n\n\n  10 \n\n \n\nAt last the  Begum  made up her mind to migrate\nto Pakistan.\n\n\nThis time she was firm about it.\n\n\nShe started looking around for customers for her property.\n\n\nA couple of deals had even gone through. \n\n \n\nZeba was pleased, very pleased.\n\n\nAnd Ismet was the happiest of them all; in her letters she was\nalmost bubbling with joy.\n\n\n Sheikh  Shabbir was equally happy.\n\n\nHis sister-in-law would enhance his prestige in the community.\n\n\nHer going away would add another feather in his cap.\n\n\nAlso, if she stayed back while he went, whenever communal trouble\nbroke out in India or a Pakistani leader made a statement against India,\nShabbir would worry about the  Begum  .\n\n\nShe could become the target of communal anger. \n\n \n\n Sheikh  Shabbir had sold his valuable property\nfor a song.\n\n\nHe made satisfactory arrangements to send his cash and gold and\njewellery to Pakistan.\n\n\nThe only question that remained to be finally decided was as to the\nplace where he would ultimately settle down.\n\n\nAll the cities of Pakistan were already overcrowded, with not an\ninch of\u00d4 left for the newcomers.\n\n\nA large number of migrants from India were still living in refugee\ncamps.\n\n\nNobody seemed to be anxious about rehabilitating them.\n\n\nThe luckier ones could find shelter with their relatives for ten\ndays, twenty days, a month or even two months.\n\n\nBut what would they do after that?\n\n\nThey could not be hangers-on for ever. \n\n \n\n Sheikh   mind was already made\nup.\n\n\nHis people had decided that even if he and his family had to starve\nthey would prefer to die in Pakistan.\n\n\nHe would not stay in India a moment longer than necessary because\nhis condition was deteriorating day by day. \n\n \n\nWhen  Begum   son who was living\nin London learnt that she was thinking of migrating to Pakistan he strongly\nadvised her against such a step.\n\n\nThe conditions in Pakistan, he wrote to her, were none too good.\n\n\nEven those who had migrated there in a hurry were now repenting at\nleisure.\n\n\nThe Panjabis of Pakistan would not allow an outsider to strike\nroots there.\n\n\nThey were specially hostile towards the Muslims of UP whom they\ncontemptuously called  \"  Bhaiyyas  \"  .\n\n\nThey never tired of making fun of them. \n\n \n\n Begum  Haseeb was in a dilemma again.\n\n\nAs for Zeba, she was all the time praising the fashionable girls of\nPakistan.\n\n\nShe had several pairs of  salwar-kameez  stitched for\nherself.\n\n\nShe was particular about the width of the  salwar \nand the girth of the  kameez  which should conform to the\nPakistani style.\n\n\nAnd, above all, their colour scheme.\n\n\nA shop in the Anarkali bazar of Lahore was named Pazeb and another\nwent by the name of Kahkashan.\n\n\nZeba had already become knowledgeable with the lay-out of Lahore and\nbragged to her mother about it.",

Then,  also the coolest class of road-users: the cycle rickshaw\npullers.\n\n\nSlowly and steadily, they trudge on, unmindful of the traffic they\nmay be holding up.\n\n\nGiving them company is the cyclist, who pedals on as if traffic\nsignals and road laws didn't exist.\n\n\nThe less said about pedestrians the better.\n\n\nFor they can flit past all barriers.\n\n\nTruck drivers have been tamed to a great extent.\n\n\nBut the spill-over of light and medium vehicles continues to worry\ncitizens.\n\n\nThey insist the traffic scenario is worsening each day.\n\n\n \"  hard to say whether  get back\nfrom office in one piece,\"  says the scooter-borne medical\nrepresentative of a leading pharmaceutical firm. \n\n \n\nTo illustrate their argument, citizens point to traffic snarl-ups\nat major squares, smashed road dividers on Gokulpeth Market road, the jams at\nvariety and Medical squares, the massive truck traffic on Wardha Road and the\n 'humped backbreakers'  set up on various roads.\n\n\nThey then allege that the entire system has slipped beyond the\ncontrol of the city police. \n\n \n\nIn order to get the true picture and set the record straight,\n \" The Hitavada\"  spoke to Commissioner of Police S.M.\nPathania recently.\n\n\nThe issues that figured in the informal chat included: road mishaps,\nthe mushrooming traffic, street-lighting, road conditions, speed breakers,\nrunaway drivers, an evaluation of the traffic system and, of course, the\n fears. \n\n \n\nWhile admitting there was a tremendous increase in the number\nof vehicles plying on the city roads, the police Chief vehemently denied\nsuggestions that the traffic system was in utter chaos.\n\n\nIn fact, he emphasised that things had improved considerably\never since his department implemented new measures to streamline traffic.\n\n\n \n\nTalking about the movement of the number one killers - - trucks -\n- he pointed out that the entry of heavy vehicles into the city is being\nregulated and monitored very carefully.\n\n\nTo ensure heavy vehicles don't run amuck patrolling by and posting of\na well equipped police force has been intensified along all major truck\nzones. \n\n \n\nAlmost two  lakh  vehicles ply on city roads on a\ndaily basis, he said.\n\n\nTo cope up with this increased traffic and regulate its flow, the\npolice has taken several measures which include modernisation of the system\nand the revamping of the outdated ones.\n\n\nBut all this can't be implemented overnight.\n\n\nBut an improvement is discernible, he pointed out. \n\n \n\nQuoting figures, the suave and soft-spoken top cop said the\nfatality count on account of road mishaps was on the decline since the new\nregulations were implemented last month.\n\n\nTwo wheelers, he said, were among the vehicles with the highest\ncasualty rate.\n\n\nTo expect a zero accident rate would be unfair in any place where\nvehicles ply. \n\n \n\nAsked about the new measures his department has in mind, the\npolice chief couldn't help having a go at cycle rickshaw pullers.\n\n\nIt    became   apparent that in his\nscheme of things, these slow-paced three wheelers were more of a liability\nthan an asset.\n\n\nBesides occupying too much road space, these vehicles account for\nseveral traffic problems.\n\n\nThere were 5, 500 registered cycle rickshaws in the city besides the\nunregistered ones.\n\n\nHe wondered how people could use such a slow mode of transport.\n\n\nBut he declined to say whether he had plans to have the rickshaws\nbanished from the  roads.\n\n\nThis is one of the problems which is being studied by his\ndepartment in depth. \n\n \n\nWHEN it was pointed out that citizens were forced to opt for\nrickshaws as  autowallahs  ask for exorbitant fares, the\npolice chief shook his head in exasperation.\n\n\n \" If the auto drivers aren't plying by the meter why don't\npeople report the matter to us.\n\n\n the people who are to blame for this continuing\nmenace,\"  he said. \n\n \n\nAsked how his department planned to reign in speed freaks who are\nknown to bypass the traffic lights and cops, the police chief said his men\nposted at high-traffic squares were equipped with sophisticated\nwalkie-talkies to counter this menace.\n\n\nIf the speedster escapes at one square,  be caught at\nthe next.\n\n\n(  , provided he goes by the next square!) \n\n \n\nHe also had it his department plans to procure more communication\nequipment so that traffic cops stay well posted.\n\n\nContd. on Page 4\n\n\n No accidents please \n\n\nContd. from Page 1\n\n\nIn case of an emergency, the police sub inspectors in charge of\nthe road traffic are equipped with motor bikes.\n\n\nThey would not hesitate to give traffic offenders a chase.\n\n\n(    At   the moment, the  'chase'\n is confined mostly to trucks.)\n\n\nThe introduction of the new type of speed-breakers called  'humps'\n , he said, had gone a long way in cutting down the speed of even the\nmost daring driver.\n\n\nThe Police Chief did not agree with the suggestion that these types\nof  'breakers'  were causing more accidents than preventing\nthem.\n\n\nIt is the latest in traffic control technology. \n\n \n\nThe earlier variety of speedbreakers called  'rumblers'\n , it was found, were not very effective.\n\n\nHeavy vehicles could cruise over them without slowing down.\n\n\nBesides, signs have been put up before each  'hump' \nto ensure road users don't miss them.\n\n\nAnd what about the natural speed breakers that the Nagpur\nMunicipal Corporation and other authorities dig up from time to time? \n\n \n\nThe police chief was diplomatic when he answered this one.\n\n\nThe civic authorities are doing their best.\n\n\nAnd we are getting full cooperation from various other authorities.\n\n\nThey have also been requested to take up the lighting up of important\nstreets on a priority basis.\n\n\nThe process is already on in most areas, he said.\n\n\nOn how he plans to deal with heavy traffic at major squares, the\npolice chief said, in order to ensure a smooth flow most of the traffic\ncircles will have to be scrapped in future.\n\n\nThis is to make sure traffic from all sides gets all the space it\nneeds to proceed smoothly.\n\n\nPart two is widening of roads. \n\n \n\nHe also discussed the road widening plan would start at Wardha\nRoad.\n\n\nThis, he also said, had been necessitated as most footpaths were\nfast disappearing and pedestrians were spilling on the roads.\n\n\nThere was also a proposal to make the Sadar road on way during peak\nhours so that school going kids were not exposed to traffic hazards.\n\n\nPolice Chief  departments also plans to introduce\na lane system at all major squares to avoid confusion when the green light\ngoes on.\n\n\nThis system is in vogue at Bombay and other metropolitan cities.\n\n\nWith the squares scrapped this system should ensure that distribution\nof ongoing traffic is not hindered, he said. \n\n \n\nIn reply to a query from a  'Hitavada'  reader,\n 'roadster'  that registration of all new vehicles be\nbanned so that traffic could be controlled more systematically, the Police\nChief declined that his department had any such plan in mind.\n\n\nHe also denied the suggestion that Nagpur roads could not take on any\nmore vehicles.\n\n\nWhat is required is traffic regulation.\n\n\nIn the very near future things are going to change rapidly.\n\n\nThere is already a marked improvement.\n\n\nWhat is needed is a change in traffic attitudes.\n\n\nThe people here are attuning themselves to the system.\n\n\nWith a little more cooperation from the citizens the system could\nchange for the better, the Police Chief also said.  \n\n\n\n\n Lendl to meet Edberg in final \n\n \n\n<@PR> MELBOURNE {#}, <@DR> Jan. 27 {#} ( <@SR> AP {#}):\n- - Ivan Lendl wielded his racket like a machine gun from the baseline\nand Stefan Edberg attacked at the net as they set up a clash in the\nAustralian Opens finals. \n\n \n\nIn swift executions by different methods, defending champion\nLendl and two-time former champion Edberg performed almost flawlessly in two\nof the most one-sided Grand Slam semifinals since the Open era began in 1968.\n\n\n \n\nLendl passed Yannick Noah left and right when the frustrated\nFrenchman charged the net, and outdueled him from the baseline when Noah\nstayed back to win 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 in one hour, 47 minutes. \n\n \n\nEdberg handed sluggish fellow Swede Mats Wilander the worst\ndefeat in his 155 Grand Slam matches, 6-1, 6-1, 6-2.\n\n\nEdberg simply had too many weapons for Wilander and put him away\nwith merciful quickness in one hour, 22 minutes. \n\n \n\nThere was a fraction of a second in  victory over\nLendl two weeks ago when Noah leaped for a volley and hung horizontally in\nmidair. \n\n \n\nHis racked outstretched and his dreadlocks flying, Noah poked\nthe ball over the net and won the point. \n\n \n\nNoah, the rejuvenated 29-year old Frenchman, needed all of that\nacrobatic effort, and more, to beat Lendl again Friday, but he couldn't\ncome up with it. \n\n \n\nThe victory two weeks ago came in a tune up in Sydney.\n\n\nThis was for the finals of a Grand Slam, and the No. 1 Lendl is a\ndifferent player when the big money is on the line. \n\n \n\nIn the 3-million-dollar Australian Open, the \nwinner gets 2,00,000 dollars, the runner-up 1,00,000 dollars and the\nsemifinalists 50,000 dollars. \n\n \n\nNoah held a 3-1 edge over Lendl on hard courts, and a 10-7 lead\nin overall matches before the semifinal match. \n\n \n\nLendl expects to use the same strategy in the finals,\ncommandeering the baseline most of the time and coming to the net on occasion\nto keep Edberg guessing. \n\n \n\n \" Always when Stefan and I play, he will serve and\nvolley and I play defence\"  , Lendl said.\n\n\n  \" I will try to fend him off.\n\n\nIt depends on how much impression I make on his serve.\n\n\nIf he holds at love or 15, he can take chances on my serve\"\n  . \n\n \n\nLendl, a Czech who lives in Greenwich, Connecticut, clicked on\n67 per cent of his first serves, drilled 36 winners past Noah and cut down on\nerrors as the match progressed. \n\n \n\nAfter making 20 errors in the first set, Lendl hit only eight in\nthe second set and six in the third. \n\n \n\nLendl, never broken in the three sets, broke Noah in the first\ngame of the match and the last, and four times in between. \n\n \n\n \" He was overpowering me from the baseline\" \n, said Noah, who made only 50 per cent of his first serves.\n\n\n  \" I wasn't moving as well as I wanted to if I wanted to\nbeat him.\n\n\nI was too far ( behind) the baseline and it was a long way to get\ninto the net.\n\n\nIn the end, I was a little flat, and he was playing really well\"\n  . \n\n \n\nIf Lendl didn't play quite as perfectly as Edberg, he played\nwell enough to satisfy himself. \n\n \n\n \" I had one of those days where I almost played perfect\ntennis\"  , Edberg said.\n\n\n  \" I think I played as well as I could.\n\n\nThe key was I hit a lot of first serves.\n\n\nI had great timing on my serves\"   . \n\n \n\nEdberg, the third seed, got in 80 per cent of his serves and put\naway 39 volley winners to  none.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1dffaeeb-a83f-4b40-9df1-6515ed2ab602", "added":

{"text": "Methodologies for Environmental Monitoring   \n\n\n S. Hasan and P.K. Mathur \n\n\n Lucknow University, Department of Chemistry, Lucknow - 226 001\n\n\n \n\n The information currently available on the status of\nenvironmental pollution have been directly dependent on the advances made in\nanalytical techniques.\n\n\n\" Organic and inorganic toxic pollutants \" are\ngenerally present in micro and submicro quantities in the environment and\ntheir determination at these level needs accurate, precise and sensitive\nanalytical techniques.\n\n\nSome of the techniques used for environmental pollutants are based\non spectrophotometry, chromatography, polorography, mass\nspectrophotometry, spectrofluorometry, ion selective electrodes and neutron\nactivation.\n\n\nThe selection of analytical technique depends on the expected level\nand characteristics of the environmental pollutants.   <&> in two\ncolumns  \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nEnvironmental pollutants are discharged into air, water and soil\nfrom anthrapogenic activity and depending on their characteristics, they\nform an equlibrium between them.\n\n\nMonitoring of environmental pollutants needs effective sampling\nprocedure and precise, sensitive and accurate analytical techniques.\n\n\nProper selection of sampling locations, preservation of samples and\nanalytical methodology are the important aspects of environmental\nmonitoring.\n\n\nSampling methods, and preservation of samples differ from one\ncomponent of environment to another.\n\n\nPretreatment of samples before using an appropriate technique also\ndiffers for    various   components of\nenvironment. \n\n\n  WATER QUALITY MONITORING  \n\n \n\nMonitoring of pollutants in water starts from its sampling and\nis based on the results of the analysis of the samples taken from a\nparticular site.\n\n\nThe monitoring results are actually indicative of the quality\nof water sample under investigation rather than the water body from where the\nsample is taken.\n\n\nIf water is of relatively uniform composition in both time and space\nthen any sample will suffice.\n\n\nHowever, if the sample is nonuniform at sampling site or its\ncomposition varies with time, then no single sample is truely representative.\n\n\nMonitoring requires that water samples are collected at intervals so\nthat no change in quality could pass unnoticed.\n\n\nThe observed value and true value always differs due to various\nreasons.\n\n\nThe larger the number of samples from which the mean is derived, the\nnarrower is the limit of the probable difference.\n\n\nHowever, the sampling schedule is a compromise between accuracy\nand facilities available for the work.\n\n\nIt is always advantageous to measure the pollutants   in\nsitu   by means of sensors which are lowered into the water\nbodies rather than withdrawing samples.\n\n\nThis is not always possible and the samples are to be collected in\nsuitable containers.\n\n\nBorosilicate glass or polyethylene bottles are suitable for sample\ncollection. \n\n \n\nMaintaining the integrity of the pollutants is an essential\npre-requisite for any monitoring programme.\n\n\nOnce the sample is taken the constituents of the sample must stay\nin the same condition as collected.\n\n\nEffective preservation method is, therefore, needed to find valid\ndata from monitoring.\n\n\nMost of the chemical parameters can be preserved from one day to\n14 day by storing the sample under refrigeration at 4 <*> degrees</*>C.\n\n\nTrace metals may be preserved upto 6 month by adding 2 ml of\nconcentrated nitric acid per litre of sample so that pH goes below 2.\n\n\nOnly mercury requires 2 ml / l of 20 % potassium dichromate\nsolution prepared in 50 % nitric acid.\n\n\nPhenol needs 6 ml of 6N sodium hydroxide solution per litre water so\nthat pH is above 12 and refrigeration at 4 <*> degrees</*>C for 24 hr\npreservation.\n\n\nOrganics are preserved by storing water samples under\nrefrigeration at 4 <*> degrees</*>C for 7 to 14 day depending on their\nnature.\n\n\nHowever, it is advisable to extract the organics into suitable\norganic solvent within 24 hr and then preserve the organic extracts under\nrefrigeration at 4 <*> degrees</*>C.\n\n\nCertain specific compounds need special preservation which depends\non their chemical properties.\n\n\nPreservation of sample is a very important step in water quality\nmonitoring and it should be strictly adhered to.  \n\n\n  AIR QUALITY MONITORING  \n\n \n\nMonitoring of pollutants in ambient air needs proper choice of\nsampler.\n\n\nFor monitoring of metals adsorbed on the suspended particulate\nmatter, a high volume sampler is the most suitable choice.\n\n\nA portion of the filter paper used for the determination of SPM is\ncut and the metal is extracted in nitric acid which is used for metals\ndetermination.\n\n\nGaseous pollutants are sampled in impingers with appropriate\nadsorption solution.\n\n\nThe gaseous pollutants having acid nature need alkali solution as\nthe ultimate choice and for gases with alkali characteristics, the choice\nis acid solution.\n\n\nMercury need acidic dichromate solution while pesticides need n -\nhexane as trapping solution.\n\n\nRecording of meterological data, like wind direction, wind speed,\ntemperature, relative humidity, etc., is essential.\n\n\nAccurate flow measurement of sampling is most important.\n\n\nNow-a-days automatic monitoring instruments based on infra-red\nspectrophotometry, chemuluminiscence, conductivity and other\nphysico-chemical properties are also available for the monitoring of\ngaseous pollutants. \n\n\n  ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING TECHNIQUES  \n\n \n\nThe requirement of the analytical technique selected for\ndetermination of a pollutant in the environment is its capability to detect\nand determine it at extremely low concentrations.\n\n\nThe technique should prferably be applicable to the sample\ndirectly and be capable of yielding information on the nature of the species\npresent.\n\n\nIt is also desirable that the technique requires bare minimum\nsample treatment to avoid contamination and subsequent enhancement of\nblank values.\n\n\nSome of the techniques used in environmental monitoring are described\nhere under. \n\n\n  Atomic spectrometry  \n\n \n\nAtomic spectrometric methods have contributed significantly\ntowards environmental pollution monitoring studies on heavy metals.\n\n\nSome of them have excellent detection limits and minimum\ninterference effects.\n\n\nHowever, the technique is incapable of yielding information on the\nspecies of the metals.\n\n\nThis technique determines the total concentration of the metals.\n\n\nMore than 60 elements can be determined at solution concentrations\nbetween 0.1 and 100 <*> mu</*>g / l.\n\n\nAtomic adsorption spectrophotometry is still the method of choice\nfor the analysis of environmental samples and both flame and non-flame\nmethods have been used for environmental monitoring.\n\n\nThe senstivity of the flame atomic adsorption spectrophotometry\nis, however, not high enough to detect most of the trace metals at levels\nthey are normally present in the environment.\n\n\nThe sensitivity of the method may be enhanced by using the method of\ncomplexation coupled with organic solvent extraction.\n\n\nThese additional steps, however, make the techniques time\nconsuming and sometimes increases blank values.\n\n\nThe flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry is suitable for major\nelements, like \" irom \" , \" manganese \" ,\n\" copper \" , \" zinc \" , etc., which\ngenerally occur in the environment at concentrations which lie in the\nsensitivity range of flame \" AAS \" technique ( Hasan and\nPande, 1978 ) . \n\n \n\nFlameless atomic absorption methods are most suitable for the\ndetermination of trace metals, like \" arsenic \" , \"\ncedmium \" , \" chromium \" , \" cobalt\n\" , \" nickel \" , \" lead \" ,\n\" salenium \" , etc.\n\n\nThe technique requires very small sample volume and has extremely\nlow detection limit.\n\n\nThis technique has, however, the problem of matrix interference which\nare quite severe and at the atomization stage non-specific absorption can\nbe very significant ( Hasan and Pande, 1988a, 1983 b ) .\n\n\nThe matrix interference can be removed either by platform technique\nor by matrix modification.\n\n\nIn the former a small graphite platform is placed inside the tube\nand the sample is introduced on the platform.\n\n\nThe platform is treated primarily by radiation from the furnace\nresulting in lower temperature in platform as compared to the temperature of\nthe tube wall.\n\n\nThis reduces the interference by lowering the rate of condensation of\nanalyte and recombination of atomic species. \n\n \n\nMatrix modification methods have been extensively used for the\ndetermination of trace metals in water and wastewater.\n\n\nIt was observed that the addition of molybdenum minimizes several\ninterferences ( Henn, 1977 ) while addition of nitric acid decereases\nnon-specific absorption caused by sodium and potassium chloride ( Tanaka\n et al  ., 1978 ) .\n\n\nInterference in the determination of lead and cadmium has been\nsuccessfully removed by the addition of aluminium ( Panda and Pendarkar, 1980 ) .\n\n\nAddition of a mixture of ascorbic acid and ammonium nitrate\nremoves the interferences due to alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and\nanions in the determination of manganese ( Kumar  et al  ., 1986 ) .\n\n\nDetermination of trace metals of environmental significance  has been reviewed ( Kumar  et al  .,\n1987 ) .\n\n\nCold vapour atomic absorption spectrophotometry using the method\ndescribed by Hatch and Ott ( 19 68 ) and modified by Uthe  et al  .\n( 1970 ) is most suitable for the determination of mercury.\n\n\nThe method involves wet acid digestion of the sample, followed\nby reduction, aeration and measurement of mercury vapour absorption at 253.7\nnm. \n\n\n  Plasma emission spectrometry  \n\n \n\nA plasma is a gas whose significant portion is ionized and\nthus large quantities of electrical energy can be transferred to it.\n\n\nThis source is, therefore, capable of atomization and excitation of\nmetals.\n\n\nBased on this principle an inductively coupled plasma ( ICP )\nsource was developed.\n\n\nThis source is an electrodeless argon plasma formed at atmospheric\npressure and sustained by inductive coupling to high frequency magnetic\nfields ( Fassel, 1978 ) .\n\n\nLater on direct current plasma ( DCP ) which is an electrical\ndischarge maintained by a core consisting of a continuous \" DC\n\" arc and stabilized by flowing gas, was also developed ( Andrew,\n1982 ) .\n\n\nPlasmas provide excellant \"\nvaporization-atomization-excitation-ionization \" sources\nfor analytical atomic emission spectropcopy.\n\n\nPlasma emission spectrometry is rapidly taking the position of atomic\nabsorption spectrophotometry.\n\n\nThe inter-element interactions are small or insignificant for\nreasonable changes in the concentrations of concomitants under\nexperimental conditions.\n\n\nIt is possible to establish a single set of calibration curves for\nthe detection of analytes in a variety of sample matrices.\n\n\nSpectral interferences are common in these techniques, however,\nthese may be reduced by judicious selection of the line to be used.\n\n\nThese techniques provide direct analysis of solid, liquid and\ngasseous pollutants with minimal sample preparation ( Walter  et al  .,\n1980 ) . \n\n\n  Colorimetry  \n\n \n\n\" Colorimetric \" methods are very frequently\nused in environmental monitoring and these methods were the only official\nmethods of determination three decades ago.\n\n\nThese methods are based on the formation of colour complexes with\nthe pollutants and then determining the absorbance of the colour which\nultimately gives the concentration of the pollutante.\n\n\nMethods based on this technique have been described in standard\nmethods for the examination of water and wastewater ( APHA, AWWA, WPCF,\n1992 ) .\n\n\nThese are universal methods and can be used for inorganic as well as\norganic pollutants.\n\n\nThese methods have, however, the problems of non-specificity and\ninferior sensitivity.\n\n\nColorimetric methods have got several advantages also as they do\nnot need sophisticated instruments or high skill and can be performed with\nsome specific chemicals and a simple spectrocolorimeter.\n\n\nExtensive literature is available on these techniques and on\ncertain occasions when no other methods are available, one has to depend\non these methods only.\n\n\nThe sensitivity may be poor but accuracy and precision are\nsuperior to other techniques. \n\n\n  Polarography  \n\n \n\nIt is an electroanalytical technique, in which the intensity of\ndiffusion current measures the concenetration and half wave potential\nidentifies the particular species.\n\n\nThis technique, however, has higher detection limit and, therefore,\nit is not used much in environmental monitoring.\n\n\nThe advancement in polarography is  ` stripping voltammetry'\n , which has wide application. \n\n\n  Stripping voltammetry  \n\n \n\n\" Stripping voltammetry \" is a 2 stage process.\n\n\nThe first stage is a preconcentration process in which the\nanalyte present in a liquid is concentrated at an electrode by\nelectrolysis.\n\n\nThe second stage consists of electrochemical removal of the\ndeposited analyte back into solution.\n\n\nThe second process is also called \" stripping process\n\" .\n\n\nThe resulting current due to stripping is used to determine the\nconcentration of analyte in the solution.\n\n\nThe preconcentration step makes \" stripping voltammetry\n\" a technique capable of determining extremely low concentration\nof the analyte.\n\n\nThe stripping current is proportional to the depolarizer\nconcentration and is frequently related to the depolarizer half wave\npotential.\n\n\nThe technique is useful in determining several species\nsimultaneously, differentiating different oxidation states and labile\nand bound forms of metal in natural waters.\n\n\nDepending on the deposition / accumulation and stripping, the\ntechnique is referred as \" anodic or cathodic stripping voltammetry\n\" .", "subdomain":

{"text": "SHORT STORY\n\n\nSUNIL GANGOPADHYAY\n\n\n A DAY LIKE A DREAM   \n\n \n\nStrange questions invaded  mind.\n\n\nShe could say anything at any time without any reason.\n\n\nIt didn't take her even a moment to change the subject.\n\n\nBecause of this she seemed even more mysterious. \n\n \n\nSubhro went with her for a walk beside the Ganga one day.\n\n\nThere was not much of a crowd there at the time.\n\n\nFour or five romantic couples were scattered here and there.\n\n\nAnd a few lazy, middle-aged men, the sort one spots in parks and such\nplaces all over the world. \n\n \n\nMany benches were empty.\n\n\nYet not one met with  approval.\n\n\nShe passed several empty ones in the shade of beautiful trees but\nrefused to sit down.\n\n\nSubhro smiled.\n\n\nIf you don't want to sit, we can walk about, he said.\n\n\nI love walking in the sun. \n\n \n\nMonolina asked, Have you ever walked in knee-deep mud? \n\n \n\nSubhro replied, Of course.\n\n\nWhy shouldn't I? \n\n \n\nWhen did you do it last?\n\n\nNot in the kind of mud you find in the streets of Calcutta.\n\n\nI am taking about knee-deep slush! \n\n \n\nSubhro was mildly perplexed.\n\n\nIt was difficult for him to say exactly when he had done so the last\ntime.\n\n\nHe was reminded of his childhood.\n\n\nHe felt as a boy, gambolling in the mud beside some unknown river.\n\n\n \n\nSeeing him take so long to reply, Monolina said, Forget it, you\ndon't have to answer the question. \n\n \n\nI remember now.\n\n\nI had gone to the Sunderbans once.\n\n\nGetting off the boat, there was a lot of slush.\n\n\nI cut my foot on a broken shell. \n\n \n\nHow long ago was that? \n\n \n\nEight or nine years.\n\n\nNo, wait.\n\n\n calculate.\n\n\nYes, it must have been 11 years back. \n\n \n\nI must have been in a frock then. \n\n \n\nMonolina couldn't have been more than 20 or 21.\n\n\nSubhro had touched 40.\n\n\nMuch of his hair had grayed.\n\n\nSeeing them together, no one would guess they were lovers.\n\n\nMaybe they were not. \n\n \n\nWhat about some coffee? Subhro asked.\n\n\nI see the cafeteria is still open. \n\n \n\nWithout replying, Monolina asked, Do you know where I was born?\n\n\nIf you ask me,  tell you I was born on the road. \n\n \n\nWhat do you mean? \n\n \n\nGuess. \n\n \n\nIn a train?\n\n\nAboard a plain?\n\n\nIn a moving car? \n\n \n\nNo, none of these. \n\n \n\nWhere then?\n\n\nThis is a difficult question, I see? \n\n \n\nI can even show you my birthplace.\n\n\nIt is actually a road. \n\n \n\nTell me the whole thing clearly! \n\n \n\nWe used to live in Dubrajpur then.\n\n\nI mean my parents.\n\n\nI was not even born then.\n\n\nTheirs was a small and pretty one-storeyed house.\n\n\nA house that does not exist any more.\n\n\nInstead, there is a road there now.\n\n\nBuses and trucks ply there. \n\n \n\nMonolina started laughing.\n\n\nThen, she flung down her books and said, Will you sit here? \n\n \n\nSubhro said, No.\n\n\nI can walk in the sun but I am not going to sit under it. \n\n \n\nThen what about sitting under the tree?\n\n\nMonolina asked.\n\n\nThe main thing is I would like to sit on the grass, not on a bench.\n\n\n \n\nWalking up to the tree, she didn't even sit down.\n\n\nShe lay on the grass.\n\n\nIt was not very clean, of course.\n\n\nChewed sugarcane lay here and there - - and a few ice-cream cups.\n\n\nMonolina did not even notice them. \n\n \n\nSubhro felt slightly uncomfortable.\n\n\nPassers-by would obviously stare at a young girl lying like that on\nthe grass.\n\n\nBut he decided not to dampen her enthusiasm. \n\n \n\nWhere were you when I was born? \n\n \n\nAfter calculating a little, Subhro said, In England, in all\nprobability.\n\n\nI went there to study when I was 19. \n\n \n\nWere you there for long? \n\n \n\nAlmost 10 years. \n\n \n\nAnd where was I when you were born? \n\n \n\nSubhro laughed.\n\n\nHe had never been asked such silly questions by any girl before.\n\n\nWhere was Monolina when he was born! \n\n \n\nSubhro said, Remember that poem by Rabindranath?\n\n\n  \" A wish has taken shape in the centre of my mind.\"\n  Your name is also very significant from that angle! \n\n \n\nDo you read poetry? \n\n \n\nWhy, aren't engineers supposed to read poetry?\n\n\nI don't get time these days but I used to read a lot once upon a\ntime. \n\n \n\nBefore leaving for England, didn't you fall in love with some\ngirl? \n\n \n\nNo. But I did immediately after reaching England! \n\n \n\nWhich means you first fell in love with an English woman? \n\n \n\nNo, it is not even that.\n\n\nI fell in love with a Bengali. \n\n \n\nHashidi? \n\n \n\nNo, I fell in love with Hashi after returning to my own country.\n\n\n \n\nThen what about the girl you first fell in love with?\n\n\nDid you not marry her or was it the other way around? \n\n \n\nShe didn't want to marry me.\n\n\nIn fact, she died suddenly one day. \n\n \n\nDo you remember her?\n\n\nDo you remember her face? \n\n \n\nYes, I remember everything. \n\n \n\nHow old was she when she died? \n\n \n\nShe was about your age. \n\n \n\n the reason why I feel like dying.\n\n\nI feel that if I die now, a lot of people will remember me for a\nlong time.\n\n\nOtherwise, I will turn old and stale one day. \n\n \n\nYou are indeed a very strange girl! \n\n \n\nKeeping quiet for a while, she suddenly tore off a fistful of\ngrass.\n\n\nStuffing it into  coat pocket she asked, Are you\nangry with me for dragging you out like this? \n\n \n\nSubrho said, No, why should I be angry?\n\n\nI am  surprised perhaps.\n\n\nBut  all. \n\n \n\nSurprise is a nice thing.\n\n\nI love surprising people. \n\n \n\nOne doesn't get easily surprised these days. \n\n \n\nIn life, we tend to get more angry than surprised.\n\n\nIsn't that right?\n\n\nBut we don't like getting angry.\n\n\nWe prefer to be surprised. \n\n \n\nShe explained this so beautifully that Subhro experienced an\nintense physical happiness.\n\n\nHe felt like caressing her.\n\n\nBut in the afternoon, in such an open place, it did not seem quite\nright.\n\n\nBesides, he hardly knew her.\n\n\nThey had met just a few days back.\n\n\nEven then, he stretched out and held her arm.\n\n\nShe did not pull it away. \n\n \n\nInstead, she gifted its exquisite warmth to him.\n\n\nAnd said, Why don't you lie down here? \n\n \n\nSubhro raised his eyebrows, What!\n\n\nLie down here! \n\n \n\nYes.\n\n\nWhy, don't you feel like doing so?\n\n\nYou look funny in your tie and coat.\n\n\nTake off your coat and bundle it up like a pillow! \n\n \n\nCan I lie down in the open, just like that? \n\n \n\nIf anyone saw him there,  basking in the afternoon\nsun, they would have been taken aback.\n\n\nAfter all, Subhrojyoti Sengupta was a very busy man.\n\n\nAfter returning from England, he worked in a government office,\nbefore starting his own firm.\n\n\nThe business had now spread, worldwide.\n\n\nEven in Malaysia, they had done work.\n\n\nSubhro was dead serious as far as his business was concerned. \n\n \n\nBesides, he wasn't a mild natured man.\n\n\nHe never boozed nor womanized.\n\n\nHad he wanted to enjoy women, there would have been no problem.\n\n\nHe travelled often and could have easily bought the pleasures of the\nflesh.\n\n\nBut Subhro didn't want to.\n\n\nHe was satisfied with his marital life. \n\n \n\nHe met Monolina only a few days back.\n\n\nShe was a friend of his sister-in-law.\n\n\nThey had been introduced to each other at a reception. \n\n \n\nThe reception got over quite late.\n\n\nHis sister-in-law said, Subhroda, can you reach my friend home?\n\n\n quite late and she would have to go alone otherwise\n<*> dotted-line</*> \n\n \n\nHashi did not attend the reception.\n\n\nShe had fever.\n\n\nThere were others in the car and Subhro had to reach them all home.\n\n\n house came last.\n\n\nEven after reaching her there, they sat back and chatted for at\nleast half an hour.\n\n\nMonolina addressed him familiarly at their very first meeting.\n\n\nPerhaps girls these days speak that way <*> dotted-line</*> \n\n \n\nMonolina said, You reached everyone home without speaking a\nword. \n\n \n\nSubhro answered hesitantly, Didn't I?\n\n\nOf course I did! \n\n \n\nThat was politeness.\n\n\nEverybody thanked you - - and you, in turn, responded.\n\n\nWere you thinking of something else?\n\n\nDo you worry about work all the time? \n\n \n\nAccording to Subhro, no one speaks this way after their first\nintroduction.\n\n\nAnd she was just a young college-going girl while he, in comparison,\nwas a responsible, older man. \n\n \n\nGetting off the car that day, Monolina said, Because you smoke a\npipe, I have noticed your eyes close sometimes.\n\n\nThose who shut their eyes in front of others - - just to smoke their\npipes - - look very silly. \n\n \n\nSubhro didn't know if he should get angry or irritated.\n\n\nMonolina said immediately thereafter, In future, try to keep your\neyes open.\n\n\nYou are not all that silly! \n\n \n\nSubhro mentioned this to his younger sister-in-law.\n\n\nYour friend is so strange! he complained.\n\n\nShe speaks in such a peculiar way <*> dotted-line</*> \n\n \n\nJoyita answered, Monolina?\n\n\nA lot of people in our college say  mad - - but I find\nher a wonderful person.\n\n\nHer heart is made of pure gold. \n\n \n\nAfter a couple of days, Monolina dropped in at home.\n\n\nIn a few minutes, she became friends with Hashi.\n\n\nWithout a trace of self-consciousness, she walked into each room in\nthe house.\n\n\nShe straightened a crooked picture frame on a wall of  room.\n\n\nShe drank three cups of tea.\n\n\nBut, as soon as she was asked to stay back for the TV film that\nevening, she picked up her books and said, No,  push off now.\n\n\n \n\nIt wasn't clear as to why she visited them or why she left so\nabruptly.\n\n\nAfter she went, it was noticed that she had forgotten her book. \n\n \n\nShe suddenly dropped in on Subhro in his office one day.\n\n\nAs usual, he was busy at a board meeting.\n\n\nHad it been anyone else, Subhro wouldn't have met the person.\n\n\nAfter all, she was a young girl and a friend of his  which made it impossible for him to ignore her\ncompletely.\n\n\nKeeping away some confidential papers on his desk, he sent for\nMonolina and asked her what she wanted. \n\n \n\nIn a manner which suggested they knew each other for years,\nMonolina said, I came to see your office.\n\n\nOne can't get to know a person after meeting him once at a\nreception.\n\n\nHe must be a different person at home from what he is at office.\n\n\n \n\nSubhro answered, Of course.\n\n\nPeople change according to their circumstances.\n\n\nWhat is so surprising about that? \n\n \n\nWill you come out with me?\n\n\n go for a stroll besides the Ganga. \n\n \n\nSubhro was shocked.\n\n\nHe was snowed under by work.\n\n\nThere were so many things to do at office that he could hardly\nbreath!\n\n\nSince the firm did not belong to anyone else, Subhro couldn't even\nthink of dropping out once in a while.\n\n\nIt was his own company, after all. \n\n \n\nAnd, then, strolling beside the Ganga in the afternoon!\n\n\nThat was the prerogative of college students. \n\n \n\nSubhro said, You feel like taking a stroll beside the Ganga <*>\ndotted-line</*> with me?\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nDon't you have friends of your own? \n\n \n\nMonolina replied, Why shouldn't I?\n\n\nI go out with many others.\n\n\nI feel like going out with you today.\n\n\nWon't you come?  \n\n \n\nSubhro was about to say, No, this is an unreasonable request.\n\n\nHow can he leave all his urgent work and go for a stroll beside the\nGanga with this chit of a girl?\n\n\nBut Monolina looked at him with her sparkling innocent eyes.\n\n\nHe felt as if he couldn't let her down, whatever may come. \n\n \n\nSo he quickly chalked out what could go wrong in breaking his\nschedule for the day.\n\n\n see, what this girl wants of me, he thought, and left\neveryone agog at the office and left.\n\n\nYes, Subhrojyoti Sengupta left his office at 3 in the afternoon with\na beautiful young girl. \n\n \n\nSubhro asked, Are you feeling odd because  wearing\nthis tie?\n\n\nIf you want,  remove it. \n\n \n\nMonolina said, Are you embarrassed to lie down on the grass?\n\n\nBut, if you lie down, you will see so much more of the sky.\n\n\nSo few of us are privileged to lie down and watch it <*>\ndotted-line</*> \n\n \n\nSubhro took off his coat, folded it carefully, placed it under\nhis head and lay down.\n\n\nHe decided to play along with her.\n\n\nBut who knew if lying down like this was illegal or not!\n\n\nWhat if the police caught them? \n\n \n\nMonolina turned towards Subhro.\n\n\nPlacing her arm on his chest, she said, You don't realise it but you\nare looking very different.\n\n\nMaybe if you saw your face, you wouldn't recognise it! \n\n \n\nSubhro said, I am indeed a different person now. \n\n \n\nHave you seen a flower bloom? \n\n \n\nWhat does that mean?\n\n\nWhat flower? \n\n \n\nAny flower.\n\n\nA bud appears on a plant.\n\n\nThen, very slowly, little by little, it begins to open till it is a\nfull blown flower.\n\n\nThen it falls off <*> dotted-line</*> \n\n \n\nNo, I haven't seen this.\n\n\n seen many kinds of flowers, garlands made of flowers,\nflowers decorated in a flower vase. \n\n \n\nThe budding of a flower looks lovelier than a fully bloomed\nflower. \n\n \n\nBut how can city people like us see such things? \n\n \n\nA lot of houses have flowering plants in pots on their terraces.\n\n\n \n\nHashi had kept a few such potted plants on our terrace but\nwasn't able to take care of them. \n\n \n\nYou didn't take care? \n\n \n\nMe?\n\n\nWhere do I have the time? \n\n \n\nA beggar child came and stood beside them, asking for alms.\n\n\nLying under the tree in the gentle breeze, Subhro was just beginning\nto savour life afresh.\n\n\nHe didn't like beggars harassing him.\n\n\nThe best way to get rid of them was to give them a coin or two.\n\n\nBut if one beggar got it, more would come.\n\n\nAnd, in any case,    Subhro   wasn't\ncarrying any change on him. \n\n \n\nGo away! \n\n \n\nBut the kid wouldn't budge.\n\n\nHis idea was to create annoyance.\n\n\nSubhro scolded him again. \n\n \n\nOpening her small purse, Monolina took out a 10 paise coin and\nput it into  palm, take this! \n\n \n\nMonolina could have given the coin to the kid on her own.\n\n\nInstead, why did she hand it to Subhro?\n\n\nSubhro felt silly.\n\n\nEven if he didn't have change, he could have easily given the beggar\na rupee.\n\n\nTo him, a rupee meant nothing! \n\n \n\nDid Monolina give that 10 paise coin to Subhro as alms?\n\n\nHe threw it at the beggar and mumbled, more beggars will now come.\n\n\n \n\nMonolina said, I have more coins on me. \n\n \n\nIn the fresh breeze, Subhro began to breathe deeply.\n\n\nHe didn't even feel like lighting his pipe.\n\n\nHe hadn't smoked even once till now. \n\n \n\nMonolina, I feel as if I have become your age. \n\n \n\nDo you think you are very big? \n\n \n\nFrom the point of view of age, I cannot deny I am quite old.\n\n\nBesides, I have entered an extremely busy world.\n\n\nI have never dreamt of lying under the sky in the afternoon.\n\n\nThank God, you called me away <*> dotted-line</*>\n\n\nI am grateful to you. \n\n \n\nA lot of us come here quite often.\n\n\nWe lie down and watch the sky. \n\n \n\nWill you let me join your group?  \n\n \n\nMonolina smiled without answering.\n\n\nSubhro felt like licking that innocent smile away from her lips.\n\n\nHe had never felt like this before.\n\n\nToday, he was feeling as excited as a child. \n\n \n\nMonolina said, Do you know of any such place where there is no\ntension, no unhappiness, no hatred, no greed? \n\n \n\nSubhro asked, Is there such a place on earth?\n\n\nI don't think so. \n\n \n\nThere is. \n\n \n\nIs there?\n\n\nWhere?\n\n\nHave you found such a place? \n\n \n\nNo, not as yet.\n\n\nBut there must be such a place somewhere <*> dotted-line</*> and,\nuntil I find it, I can imagine such a place in my mind <*> dotted-line</*>\nlying like this with my eyes shut.\n\n\nWhy don't you try.\n\n\nShut your eyes <*> dotted-line</*> \n\n \n\nSubhro actually shut his eyes.\n\n\nHe was instantly reminded of all the work he had left behind at the\noffice, unattended.\n\n\nHe felt irritated with himself.\n\n\nHe tried to forget everything.\n\n\nA little later, he felt as if he was dozing off.\n\n\nIn sleep there was, of course, a peaceful place - - devoid of greed,\nof hatred. \n\n \n\nSubhro sat up.\n\n\nMonolina still lay with her eyes shut.\n\n\nWhat did this girl want from him?

\n\n \n\nYes, whenever you feel up to it. \n\n \n\nSubhro knew he couldn't be any more late.\n\n\nHe walked towards the road and hailed a cab.\n\n\nBut Monolina refused outright to get inside.\n\n\nShe wanted to walk. \n\n \n\nThe cab carrying Subhro away made a U-turn.\n\n\nHe turned around and watched for a long time. \n\n \n\nMonolina was walking slowly, her head lowered.\n\n\nIt looked as if she would melt into the horizon. \n\n \n\nWanting to light his pipe, Subhro put his hand inside his coat\npocket and felt something else. \n\n \n\nIt was a fistful of grass. \n\n \n\nMonolina had stuffed it into his pocket.\n\n\nHe was about to throw it away but changed his mind.\n\n\nReturning to his office, he stashed it away in one of his table\ndrawers. \n\n \n\nThe days began to pass like before.\n\n\nIn the same monotonous way.\n\n\nIn about a   time, Subhro had to go to\nDelhi on company work.\n\n\nHe returned after two days.\n\n\nMonolina hadn't come. \n\n \n\nSubhro remembered her sometimes.\n\n\nAnd his heart would feel crushed. \n\n \n\nWhen he had asked Monolina if they would ever meet again, she\nsaid they could only if he wished it.\n\n\nDidn't he?\n\n\nBut wishes are not everything.\n\n\nMonolina hadn't asked him for anything.\n\n\nSubhro had also thought deeply over the fact she didn't have any\nother intention.\n\n\nShe didn't try to lure him into falling in love with her.\n\n\nHe had money, prestige.\n\n\nBut Monolina hadn't showed any interest in such things.\n\n\nNot a paise had he spent on her.\n\n\nOn the contrary, it was she who put a 10 paise coin into  palm.\n\n\nAs if she was the heiress to a fortune, she had declared that she\nhad a lot more coins. \n\n \n\nMonolina didn't ask for anything except only his willingness.\n\n\nBut that wasn't all.\n\n\nBecause even if he wished, he couldn't make the time to lie on the\ngrass, beside the Ganga in the afternoon.\n\n\nSo he didn't even try to track down Monolina.\n\n\nHe felt ashamed to ask his sister-in-law, Joyita, about her\nwhereabouts.\n\n\nHe knew where she lived.\n\n\nHe had dropped her home that night.\n\n\nBut how could he just drop in at her place and ask her to go out\nwith him!\n\n\nThat wasn't possible.\n\n\nHe was Subhrojyoti Sengupta, a very busy person.\n\n\nAll this childishness didn't become him. \n\n \n\nOnce in a while, he still pulls open the drawer and looks at the\nfistful of grass.\n\n\nIt has dried up.\n\n\nBut he still keeps it there.\n\n\nSubhro sighs.\n\n\nLying down on the grass, under that tree in the afternoon with  arm on his chest seems like a dream. \n\n \n\nBut it wasn't a dream.\n\n\nThe fistful of grass is still there to prove it. \n\n \n\nMonolina had asked, where was I when you were born?

Hegde, said today, reports <@SR>\nUNI {#}. \n\n \n\nThe changes in the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 and\nsubsequent Government statements in this regard would be finalized soon\nafter wide-ranging discussions with captains of industry. \n\n \n\nBriefing reporters on the three-day deliberations of the\nwhole-time members of the newly-constituted Planning Commission, Mr Hedge\nsaid the draft approach paper on the Eighth Plan ( 1990- ) would\nbe ready by the end of this month. \n\n \n\nMr Hegde said the approach paper would be drawn up in accordance\nwith the policies, programmes and priorities of the new Government and the\nideology of the National Front Government. \n\n \n\nThe commission had worked out a time table for finalizing the\ndraft approach paper by the end of this month. \n\n \n\nTill then the commission would receive the views of various\nrepresentative organizations like the Chambers of Commerce and\nIndustry, since there  \" is going to be a radical change\" \nin the industrial policy. \n\n \n\nThe consultation with the captains of industry was to ascertain\nwhether they were prepared to invest in the priority areas set by the new\nGovernment. \n\n \n\nMr Hegde said the working of the public sector units, particularly\nin the spheres of steel, petro-chemicals, fertilizer and power, would be\nreviewed.\n\n\nThis exercise would be designed to take  \" corrective\naction\"  and remove weaknesses that had crept into the functioning\nof the sector. \n\n \n\nMr Hegde said there was consensus at the three-day meeting on\nthe need to reduce the number of Centrally-sponsored schemes.\n\n\n \" We would rather have more and more of  panchayat\n , district and  zilla parishad  - sponsored schemes\nthan Centrally-sponsored schemes\"  , he said. \n\n \n\nHow drastically the Centrally-sponsored schemes were to be\nreduced would be decided by the end of the month, he added. \n\n \n\n He said the  Jawahar Rozgar Yojana  and\n Nehru Rozgar Yojana  would be recast, and their names\nwould be changed with  \" good ones\"  .  \n\n \n\nMr Hegde said local institutions would have a decisive role in\nchoosing the kind of employment to be provided to the rural unemployed.\n\n\n \n\nThere will be direct funding to  panchayat \ninstitutions but not from the  \" Prime Minister to District\nMagistrate\"  , he said.\n\n\nThe State Governments  \" will not be bypassed and we will\nfunction within the federal framework\"  .\n\n\nThe funding of the local bodies would be through the State\nGovernments. \n\n \n\nMr Hegde said after the approach paper was ready, a meeting of\nthe National Development Council would be called to consider it  \n\n\n\n\n BUSINESS \n\n\n Displaying success \n\n\n Leather fair may net Rs 200  crore      \n\n \n\nSOUTH  only annual international fair is\ngrowing  'fairer'  by the year.\n\n\nThis  leather fair in Madras was an impeccable show\nindeed - - scores of aesthetically designed cubicles, set in neat rows,\ndisplaying an exhaustive array of goods and machinery.\n\n\nThe presence of a large number of foreigners, both as participants\nand visitors, lent the grand event the international dimension. \n\n \n\nIn terms of sheer size, the fifth India International Leather\nFair, in January, was unprecedented.\n\n\nFrom a few hundred square meters in 1985 the display area had gone\nup to 6,000 sq. meters.\n\n\nMore than a hundred of the 260 exhibitors were from abroad and this\nwas proof enough that the Madras fair has gained in importance the world\nover. \n\n \n\nAs in the previous years, the Italians with their sophisticated\nmachinery and upmarket products dominated the fair.\n\n\nThere were the Germans, the French, the British and the Americans\ntoo, quite a few of them well-known names.\n\n\nVisitors from 25 countries attended the fair and there were 20\nofficial business delegations from abroad. \n\n \n\nA quick survey showed that nearly 15,000 business visitors were\nregistered on the first three days of the fair.\n\n\nNew business worth several  crores  of rupees was\nstruck at the fair.\n\n\nMoreover the fair gave an opportunity to Indian exporters to\nestablish contacts with many foreign buyers. \n\n \n\nAccording to K.V. Rajan, chief general manager of Trade Fair\nAuthority of India, the organisers of the fair, participants of last  fair had reported business worth Rs 100  crore  as\na direct result of the fair.\n\n\n \" This year it could be in the region of Rs 200  crore\n , \"  he says. \n\n \n\nOne criticism that has been levelled against the fair right from\nits inception is that it is largely import-oriented.\n\n\nThe large turnout of machinery and equipment manufacturers from\nabroad with their imposing gadgets has always kept the domestic industry\nunder their shadow, it is said.\n\n\nProponents of this criticism point to the number of import deals\nstruck at the fair, which are more than the export inquiries, as proof. \n\n \n\nOfficials of the Trade Fair Authority of India and the Council of\nLeather Exports ( CLE) justify that the import slant is    perfectly   in tune with the multi-faceted objective of the\nfair.\n\n\nM.M. Hashim, chairman of CLE, points out that the Indian leather\nindustry needs most urgently large-scale modernisation of its existing\nproduction facilities to enable it to compete effectively in the highly\nsophisticated international market.\n\n\n  \" Upgrading of technology will enhance the quality of the\nproducts as also cut back on manufacturing costs.\n\n\nQuality and price are the two significant factors that will\ndetermine  future in the world market, \"   he\nfeels. \n\n \n\nIt is true that, despite the  impressive gains\nmade on the leather export front in the last few years, its share in the\ntotal global imports has remained at a woefully negligible figure of less\nthan two per cent.\n\n\nAs per  projections,  exports should\nreach five per cent of world imports by the turn of the century.\n\n\nExpansion of the production base with a massive dose of modernisation\nis the only way to achieve this.\n\n\n exports now stand at Rs 2,000  crore \na year. \n\n \n\nIn this context, the fair provides an excellent opportunity for\ndomestic entrepreneurs to get first-hand knowledge of the advances made in\nthe leather technology field.\n\n\nThis apart, small-scale manufacturers, who form 75 per cent of the\ndomestic cartel and who can ill-afford to go abroad, are immensely benefited\nby the fair. \n\n \n\nA survey of the business inquiries at this  fair\nhas revealed that nearly half of the orders made were for exports.\n\n\nThe survey done by TFAI with assistance from NIIT of Delhi shows that\nthe percentage of exporters among the total business visitors was 37.37\nwhereas it is only 10.93 for importers. \n\n \n\nHowever TFAI has a problem: how to accommodate the growing number\nof participants, year after year.\n\n\nSpace at Rajaji Hall in Madras is limited.\n\n\nThere was speculation that the fair may be shifted to Delhi from next\nyear onwards if a larger and permanent site could not be found in Madras.\n\n\nBut the rumours have now been scotched with the Union commerce\nministry announcing that the fair will continue to be held in Madras\nconsidering its importance in the leather map of the country.\n\n\nBesides, an overwhelmingly large number of participants, both\ndomestic and overseas, have expressed their preference for the city, with its\ninformal atmosphere and distinctive cultural ambience, to any other location.\n\n\nWhile next  fair has been tentatively fixed to be held\nat Rajaji Hall, TFAI has renewed its efforts to get a larger and permanent\nsite allocated by the Tamil Nadu government. \n\n\n - - <@AS> JOS ALAPPAT {#}  \n\n\n\n\n MUSIC \n\n\n  L.  east-west fusion  \n\n\n Strings of success   \n\n \n\nEast is east and west is west; and never shall the twain meet.\n\n\nMaybe.\n\n\nBut the Kipling cliche dissolves delightfully in the musical magic of\nthe master fusionist from Madras, L.

Take my word, one day\nyou would become the king of violin.\"   \n\n \n\nHe did and became the first Indian violinist to have performed at\nthe Bolshoi Theatre, the Lincoln Centre, the Royal Albert Hall, and the\nChamps Elysees Theatre.\n\n\nThe orchestral piece,  Fantasy on Vedic Chants  , he\ncomposed when his mother expired has been performed all over the world\nincluding at the famous Tchaikovsky Hall in Moscow by the USSR-TV Radio\nSymphony Orchestra conducted by Vladimir Fedoseyov.\n\n\n The Fantasy, Turbulence  and  Shantipriya  proved\nto be instant hits.\n\n\nBesides, he composed the music for Mira  film \nSalam Bombay  and was the music    adviser \n for Peter  stage production  Mahabharata  .\n\n\nHe has produced about 50 records including a five-volume \nAnthology of Indian Music  for Radio France. \n\n \n\n  Fantasy Without Limits  , one of\nthe first east-west albums released in the US, was selected one of the best\nalbums of the year.\n\n\n Blossom  won the Spring Journal Award in Japan.\n\n\nAnother milestone is  Conversations  , his album with\nveteran violinist Stephane Grappelli which also featured the well-known Joe\nSample. \n\n \n\n  \" I am very lucky to have been born in a musical\nfamily.\n\n\nMy forefathers belonged to Alleppey, Kerala; my grandfather was a\nboat manager.\n\n\nAnd my mother also hails from Kerala,\"   says\nSubramaniam. \n\n \n\n father Prof. Lakshminarayana, a violin\nteacher, wanted to groom him as a vocalist.\n\n\nTwo-year-old  'Subbu'  would imitate the tunes hummed\nby Lakshminarayana.\n\n\nBut  dream was shattered when\nSubramaniam contracted diphtheria.\n\n\nHowever, not losing heart, Lakshminarayana opened his \neyes to the world of musical instruments.\n\n\nFirst it was the harmonium: by age five Subramaniam took the bow and\nat the age of six made his debut. \n\n \n\nThe family moved to Jaffna, Sri Lanka, when Lakshminarayana got a\njob in the Jaffna College, and later to Colombo.\n\n\nIn 1958 when Tamils of Indian origin were being killed, the family\nmigrated to Madras and settled down in Royapettah.\n\n\n \" We had to leave all our belongings in Colombo and landed in\nMadras with just the clothes we wore,\"  says Subramaniam.\n\n\nLakshminarayana then started a troupe which launched  career. \n\n \n\nEven as a student of Madras Medical College, Subramaniam used to\naccompany the leading Carnatic vocalists.\n\n\nIt was then that he came into contact with Chembai.\n\n\n  \" It was Chembai Mama who gave me encouragement to become\na solo violinist.\n\n\nAs he predicted, I have never earned a single rupee by writing a\nmedical prescription to date,\"   says Subramaniam. \n\n \n\n  \" While I was attending the medical course I asked\nthe university authorities to allow me to pursue a music course at the\nsame time.\n\n\nBut their rules did not allow me to do so.\n\n\nLater, after completing MBBS, I approached them again.\n\n\nThis time they said that I had to undergo the whole process of\ncollege studies and the shortest time they specified to earn a degree in\nmusic was six years.\"   \n\n \n\nHe then sent an application to the California Institute of Arts\nalong with a recorded tape of his music.\n\n\nMeanwhile, a visiting professor from Ithaca College, Inar Holmes\noffered him admission to the Ithaca College on condition that he join his\ntroupe which had performed all over the world.\n\n\nConcurrently, the California institute offered him admission\nstraightaway to the MA course.\n\n\nSubramaniam went to California, completed his two-year MA course\nin nine months, headed the department of South Indian Music till 1976, when\nhe quit  \" because I started performing in so many places that it\nbecame difficult for me to do justice to teaching\"  . \n\n \n\nThe westerners in the seventies, believed that the Indian\nviolin, performed by half-nude men sitting on the floor, was nothing but a\nfolk instrument.\n\n\nTo them only  tabla  and  sarod  were\nIndian classical instruments.\n\n\nSubramaniam, in an effort to change this attitude, related\nBach and baroque music to Indian music.\n\n\nThat, now everyone concedes, has broken down the east-west\nbarrier in violin music. \n\n\n - - <@AS> DEVIKA RANI {#}", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "edad0cc5-0ab5-4325-8b65-a72e22d009d7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.043639+00:00"}

-\nin the life of writers.\n\n\nIt is a direct attack on the old methods of literary art.\n\n\nWe shall have to adapt ourselves to the shadowy screen and to the\ncold machine.\n\n\nA new form of writing will be necessary <*> dotted line</*>\n\n\nBut I rather like it.\n\n\nThis swift change of scene, this blending of emotion and\nexperience -

- life or cinema!) \n\n \n\nFrom political philosophy to transcendental metaphysics, cinema\nhas expressed it all.\n\n\nIts ability to syncretise would have been tested by  unrealised project to make a film on   Capital  .\n\n\nEisenstein wanted to make use of James  inner\nmonologue to compress material across centuries and civilisations, in one\nday in the life of a worker.\n\n\nThis Griffin on a film was to have a tongue-in-cheek credit line:\n \"  \" Capital \"  , a film by Sergei\nEisenstein, based on the text of Karl Marx with a scenario by James\nJoyce.\"  \n\n \n\nCinema, from its birth has shown its capability to express with\nequal ease the waking and dream states of human existence.\n\n\nIn fact, its greatest achievements have come precisely from its\ndual nature.\n\n\nIts ability to record has enabled it to be a witness to our times\n( to borrow a phrase of  ) as no other art form has done.\n\n\nFrom two world wars to atomic explosions, famines, earthquakes, it\nhas recorded all that is terrible and that will be indissolubly associated\nwith our century.\n\n\nIt has also recorded with loving care our achievements in the\nmaterial world, when man broke his bondage to the earth and set foot on the\nmoon.\n\n\nIt is a curious irony of history that one of the earliest films by\nGeorge Melies was an imaginary voyage to the moon and within a few decades,\ncameras were recording the real voyage to the moon. \n\n \n\nNot only has it recorded our reality, our history as we made it\nwith heroism and cowardice, with imagination and stupidity, with our heroes\nand villains - - which other century has been its Grandhi and Hitler\nrecorded? - - but it has done much more. \n\n \n\nIt has been a witness to our cherished dreams as well as to our\nperversions and nightmares.\n\n\nThe collective being watching the moving images in the realm of\nshadows, lost to its own materiality as well as to that of the world around,\nhas seen its own unconscious projected on screens all over the weorld.\n\n\nThe film form has assumed the shape of the concrete-sensuous world as\nwell as the nebulous, ever changing aspects of our wishes, fears, passions\ntraumas and visions.\n\n\nFrom intensely personal expression to shameless spectacle, from\nspiritual quest to sheer pornography, cinema has been it all. \n\n \n\nJust as a human being, in the period that it spends in the womb,\nexperiences the entire history of evolution in a capsule form, cinema in its\n100 years of non-solitude, has assumed all forms of life.\n\n\nThrough the powers of animators, it has freed us from the tyranny\nof the laws of gravity, relativity and causality.\n\n\nIt has in its dark halls, given us the power over objects and\nevents that alchemists, shamans and magicians have craved for centuries.\n\n\n \n\nAnd yet, of all the art forms it seems to be the one most\nthreatened with extinction. \n\n \n\nWill there be cinema in the 21st century? \n\n \n\nThis is the question everyone who has been in love with cinema\nis afraid to ask and yet must ask. \n\n \n\nWith the advances in technology, the spectacle is brought to\nthe viewer and there is no need for him to leave his home.\n\n\nTheoretically, the entire population of the world can watch the\nsame event, just as it happens.\n\n\nBut with the  ` one world'  there is the media\ncontrol, the monopolies, the vast amounts and, to quote Tolstoy again,\n \" the toad -

Mansoor Ahammed\n\n\n Indian Institute of Technology, Environmental Engineering\nLaboratory, Department of Civil Engineering, Kanpur  - 208 016\n\n \n\n Sand is universally used as a filter medium in the\nproduction of potable water.\n\n\nSlow sand filtration has been used in \" water treatment\n\" in Europe since 1829.\n\n\n\" Sand filtration \" has proven to be an effective\nprocess for the removal of microorganisms during one and half centuries of\nuse.\n\n\nAttempts have been made to modify sand by precipitation of chemicals,\nsuch as \" metallic hydroxide \" on it and to use it for the\nremoval of various contaminants from \" water \" and \"\nwastewater \" .\n\n\n\" Diatomaceous earth \" which has been used on a\nlimited scale in \" potable water treatment \" but widely in\n\" industrial water processing \" has also been similarly\nmodified.\n\n\nThis paper reviews the available information on the application of\nmodified sand and diatomaceous earth in the removal and recovery of heavy\nmetals from \" industrial effluents \" , \" removal of\nmicrooorganisms \" from water, and \" removal of arsenic\nand manganese \" from ground water.\n\n\n\" Microbiological purification efficiency of slow sand and\ndiatomaceous earth filters \" has also been discussed.\n\n\nSome of the mechanisms involved in the removal of various\ncontaminants are also presented.    \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nDeveloped in England, slow sand filtration has been used for\ntreating drinking water from the beginning of the nineteenth century.\n\n\nIt has been proven to be an effective process for the removal of\nmicroorganisms if operated under proper conditions.\n\n\nEven though the most commonly used method of filtration now a days is\n\" rapid sand filtration \" in which water moves down at a\nmuch greater rate than in slow sand filtration, high construction cost and\nmaintenance requirements make it unsuitable for application in rural areas of\ndeveloping countries.\n\n\nConsiderable pretreatment, namely \" coagulation-sedimentation\n\" is necessary for a rapid sand filter for effective\npurification.\n\n\nThough sand filtration is effective in the removal of particulates\nincluding microorganisms, it is not efficient in removing other contaminants\nfrom water.\n\n\nRecently, attempts have been made to modify sand siliceous materials,\nlike \" diatomaceous earth \" by coating it with different\nchemicals, such as \" metal hydroxides \" and to use the\nmodified materials in the removal of various contaminats from \" water\n\" and \" wastewater \" .\n\n\nThis paper briefly reviews the research on \" slow sand\n\" and \" diatomaceous earth filtration \" , and\ndiscusses the results of recent investigations on the application of\n\" modified sand \" and other \" siliceous materials in\nwater \" and \" wastewater treatment \" . \n\n\n  REMOVAL OF MICROORGANISMS BY SLOW SAND FILTRATION \n\n\n \n\nIn slow sand filtration, uncoagulated water is applied to a\nsand bed of about 1 m deep at a filtration rate of 0.1 m / hr.\n\n\nImpurities in water are removed by a combination of \"\nprocesses-sedimentation \" , \" straining \" ,\n\" adsorption \" and \" biological action \" .\n\n\nDuring the first few days, water is purified mainly by mechanical\nand physical processes.\n\n\nThe resulting accumulation of sediments and organic growth forms a\nbiologically active scum layer ( schmutzdecke ) on the sand surface.\n\n\nAs the water enters the schmutzecke, biological action breaks down\nsome of the organic matter.\n\n\nImpurities carried deeper into the filter bed come into contact with\nand become attached to sand grains, and the sand particles become covered\nwith a thin layer of organic materials and microorganisms which in turn\nadsorbs the impurities.\n\n\nWhen the resistance in the filter skin increases, filtration\ncapacity can be restored by draining off the supernatant water and\nremoving the top 1 - 2 cm of the sand bed including the schmutzdecke. \n\n \n\n\" Slow sand filtration \" has proven to be an\neffective process in the removal of various microorganisms, if operated\ncorrectly.\n\n\nMost of the studies  showed more than\n99.0 % removal of coliform bacteria.\n\n\nUncertainty exists about the role of schmutzdecke in bacterial\nremoval.\n\n\nWhile most of the studies showed a decrease in bacterial removal\nafter the removal of schmutzdecke, Cullen and Letterman ( 1985 ) did not\nnotice any effect of filter ripening on the bacterial removal while\nevaluating municipal slow sand filters.\n\n\nDatta and Chaudhuri ( 1991 ) observed that a mature filter was\nwell-populated throughout with active microorganisms, with its maximum in\nthe top 20 - 25 cm layer.\n\n\nVirus removal by slow sand filtration has been evaluated by many\nresearchers.\n\n\nPoynter and Slade ( 1977 ) found that  \" Escherichia coli\n\"  removals were similar to or slightly less than poliovirus\nremovals.\n\n\nThe mechanism of virus removal by \" slow sand filtration\n\" is not clearly resolved.\n\n\nRobeck  et al.  ( 1962 ) reported that removal of\npoliovirus by \" clean sand beds \" was not significant which\nsuggests that adsorption did not account for most of the virus removal\naccomplished in a slow sand filter.\n\n\nOn the other hand, McConnell  et al.  ( 1984 ) did not find\nany effects related to the ripening of the sand bed.\n\n\nThey reported that influent reovirus, concentrations were reduced\nby greater than 5 log units in a slow sand filter having either clean sand\nor aged sand.\n\n\nThis suggests that microbiological actions may not necessarily be\nresponsible for observed virus inactivation in the sand bed and that\nvirus may adsorb onto sand very readily. \n\n\n  REMOVAL OF MICROORGANISM BY DIATOMACEOUS EARTH\nFILTRATION  \n\n \n\n\" Diatomaceous earth filtration \" was developed\nduring the second world war primarily to ensure complete removal of \n\" Endamoeba histolytica cysts \"  .\n\n\nA number of studies have been reported on the effectiveness of\n\" diatomaceous earth filtration \" in the removal of\nbacteria, virus and  Giardia  cysts.\n\n\nLange  et al.  ( 1936 ) evaluated  Giardia  cysts\nremoval by diato maceous earth filtration.\n\n\nThey operated a diatomaceous earth test filter at different flow\nrates over a temperature range of 3 to 15 <*> degrees</*>C and with different\nparticle size distribution of diatomaceous earth.\n\n\n Giardia  cyst removal always exceeded 99 % and exceeded\n99.9 % in 50 % of the runs.\n\n\nSchuler  et al.  ( 1991 ) reported that diatomaceous\nearth filtration can be expected to remove 100 % of  Giardia  cysts.\n\n\nLange  et al.  ( 1986 ) evaluated removal of coliform\nbacteria by diatomaceous earth filtration.\n\n\nRemoval varied with the grade used, ranging from 30 to 70 %.\n\n\nSchuler  et al.  ( 1991 ) reported that removal of coliform\nbacteria was profoundly affected by the grade of diatomaceous earth used.\n\n\nCoarse grades obtained removals between 0 and 57 %.\n\n\nRemoval in excess of 99 % could be obtained when a finer grade of\ndiatomaceous earth was used. \n\n \n\nBrown  et al.  ( 1974 ) evaluated removal of viruses\nusing \" bacateriophage T2 \" and poliovirsus by \"\ndiatomaceous earth filtration \" .\n\n\nThey observed average bacteriophage removals in the range of\n73-100 % depending on the grade used.\n\n\nFiner filter grades were more effective.\n\n\nPoliovirus removal ranged from 60 to 100 %.\n\n\nThey concluded that diatomaceous earth filtration can reduce the\nconcentration of viruses in water; but the most effective technique\nrequires either conditioning of the raw water or conditioning of the\ndiatomaceous earth to enhance virus attachemnt to the diatomaceous\nearth during filtration.\n\n\nChaudhuri  et al.  ( 1974 ) observed that there was little,\nif any, removal of bacteriophages by filtration through diatomaceous\nearth.\n\n\nHowever, filtration through diatomaceous earth coated with\ncationic polyelectrolyte resulted in significant virus removal.\n\n\nThey also found that the efficiency of virus removal was affected by\nseveral variables, like pH, type of diatomaceous earth, turbidity and\nfiltration rate.\n\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that diatomaceous earth filtration has\nthe capacity to remove a variety of microorganisms.\n\n\nIt is most effective when microorganisms are in the size range of\n Giardia  or  E. histolytica  cysts.\n\n\nSmaller organisms may also be removed, however, if the removal\nmechanisms is straining, the diatomaceous paraticle size must be finer as the\nsize of target organism decreases.\n\n\nIf this surface attachment is the removal mechanism, coarse grades of\ndiatomaceous earth can be coated with metallic hydroxide flocs.\n\n\nThe resulting positively charged diatomaceous earth can remove\nmicroorganisms by surface attachment. \n\n\n  VIRUS REMOVAL USING METAL HYDROXIDE COATED DIATOMACEOUS\nEARTH  \n\n \n\nThe ability of metallic hydroxides to adsorb viruses in water has\nled to efforts to use such precipitates in flowthrough systems.\n\n\nBut poor adhesion of the precipitate to the filter material and\nclogging have been encountered in using insoluble metallic hydrodixe\nflocs in conjuction with filter supports ( Farrah \n et al.,  1991 ) .\n\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, Farrah  et al.  ( 1991 )\nmodified diatomaceous earth by   in situ  \nprecipitation of metallic hydroxides, such as aluminium, calcium, iron or\nmagnesium and used it for removal and recovery of viruses from water.\n\n\nThe modification decreased the negative charge on the diatomaceous\nearth and increased its ability to adsorb viruses in water.\n\n\nFilter containing diatomaceous earth modified by  in situ\n precipitation of iron and aluminium adsorbed greater than 80 % of\nenteroviruses ( poliovirus 1, echovirus 5 and coxsackievirus B5) and\ncoliphage MS2 present in tapwater at ambient pH ( 7.8 - 8.3 ) , even after\nfiltration of 100 lit of tapwater.\n\n\nElectrostatic interactions were found to be more important than\nhydrophobic interaction in virus adsorption to modified diatomaceous\nearth.\n\n\nIn another study, Farrah and Preston ( 1991 ) coated diatomaceous\nearth with magnesium peroxide and used this medium for adsorbing\nviruses from water.\n\n\nFilters containing 3.5 g of diatomaceous earth adsorbed an average of\ngreater than 90 % of \" MS2 \" , poliovirus 1 and\ncoxsackievirus B5 in tapwater at approximately pH 8.5 even after\nfiltration of 100 lit of tapwater through the filter. \n\n\n  ARSENIC REMOVAL BY SAND FILTRATION  \n\n \n\nExcess arsenic in groundwater has been reported from different\nparts of the country.\n\n\nRecent discovery of arsenic as carcinogens has added new dimension\nto the established health effects, such as gastrointestinal damage due to\narsenic.\n\n\nThe conventional methods of arsenic removal, such as precipitation,\nadsorption and ion exchange are not suitable for application in villages as\nthese processes are cost- and energy-intensive, and require skilled\noperation and maintenance.\n\n\nIn view of this, Guha and Chaudhuri ( 1991 ) conducted studies to\ndevelop low-cost point-of-use treatment devices for use in rural areas of\ndeveloping countries, like India.\n\n\nThey conducted laboratory studies employing \" As (  3\n ) - spiked groundwater \" to screen sorbent, such as\nbituminous coal, lignite, crushes coconut shell, illite, kaolinite, rice\nhusk, flyash, charcoal and sand.\n\n\nBased on batch and short-term column studies, sand emerged as the\nmost potentially useful medium.\n\n\nSand was more effective in arsenic removal above pH 7.0.\n\n\nIn long duration column study ( sand depth 90 cm, flow rate 0.12 m/\nhr, and influent arsenic concentration 1.0 mg / lit ) , sand produced\neffluent arsenic level below the WHO guideline value for drinking water (\n0.05 mg / l ) for 32 hr.\n\n\nAmong the different regenerant tested, 0.2 N NaOH was observed to be\nmost suitable.\n\n\nVaishya and Agarwal ( 1993 ) also employed sand as sorption medium\nfor treating ground water containing low level of \" As ( \n3) \" .\n\n\nIn batch experiments conducted at As ( concentrations of 0.1\n- 1.6 mg / l at different sand doses of 5 - 40 g / l, the maximum removal was\nobserved to be 0.024 mg / g of sand. \n\n\n  SILVER COATED-SAND FOR DOMESTIC WATER FILTER \n\n\n \n\nSilver which is known for its bacteriostatic and bactericidal\nproperties has also been coated on sand.\n\n\nThe Karachi laboratories of the \" Pakistan Council of\nScientific and Industrial Research \" ( PCSIR, 1985 ) developed\nand tested several silver-based devices for the treatment of potable water in\nthe developing countries.\n\n\nThe one most suitable for use in rural settings consists of nylon\nbags with silver-coated sand.\n\n\nPreliminary test with  \" Salmonelle typha \" ,\n\" Escherichia coli \" , \" Shigella dysenteriae\n\"  and  \" Staphylococcus spp. \"  have\nindicated that there is a 90 % decrease in number of viable bacteria when\nsamples of experimentally contaminated water are filtered through the bags\nat a flow rate of 1 l / min \n\n\n  IRON OXIDE-COATED SAND FOR REMOVAL AND RECOVERY OF HEAVY\nMETALS FROM WASTEWATER  \n\n \n\nAmorphous iron oxide ( ferrihydrite ) is an excellent regenerable\nadsorbent.\n\n\nStudies have shown that ferrihydrite can remove copper, cadmium,\nzinc, nickle and chromium from metal-plating wastes to levels lower than\nthat attainable by precipitation ( Edwards and Benjamin, 1989a ) .\n\n\nFerrihydrite is formed inconventional metal plating waste\ntreatment by precipitation of iron salts, which are often added to help\ncoagulate precipitated metal hydroxides.\n\n\nMetal removal by adsorption onto ferrihydrite is an important side\nbenefit of this practice.\n\n\nSince adsorption is not effective when large quantities of adsorbent\nare present, a higher coagulant dose will improve treatment efficiency in\nmost cases.\n\n\nHowever, increasing the ferrihydrite concentration leads to a\ncorresponding increase in the sludge mass which adds substantially to the\ncost of sludge disposal.\n\n\nTo overcome this drawback, Edwards and Benjamin ( 1989b ) developed\nmethods of coating sand with iron oxide to produce an adsorbent with greater\nflexibility of application, combining the advantages  of adsorption and filtration processes.\n\n\nDepending on the solution pH, iron oxide-coated sand can adsorb\neither cationic or anionic metals at alkaline and acidic pH, respectively.\n\n\nComplexed and particulate forms of metals can also be efficiently\nremoved.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9ab59b72-8035-48b7-8376-6fd24f496673", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.046016+00:00"}

- too much of a shock for the system.\n\n\nThat mind, which had had such a cutting edge, had begun to wander.\n\n\nShe was sleeping in exhaustion when I called.\n\n\nAnd remember Sister Agatha,  been like a second mum\nto me -

{"text": "Shakespeare and politics  \n\n \n\n  DURING   my recent visit to\nStratford-upon-Avon to attend and give a paper at the conference of  scholars, I could not imagine my stay abroad without being\nable to be exposed to the media obsessed with the reunification of Germany\nand the Gulf crisis.\n\n\nAppropriately, the title of the conference was  \" Shakespeare\nand Politics\"  .\n\n\nShakespeare has many adjectives like  \" vile\" \" scurvy\"\n to describe a politician and he had scant regard for judges, who\ndressed with brief little authority played ducks and drakes with the lives of\npeople.\n\n\nThe media did not bother about the Shakespeare conference. \n\n \n\nI had a busy week attending and giving a lecture, participating\nin seminars and going to the theatre to see  plays at\nSwan and National theatre.\n\n\nRadio and television put out the news on the German reunification and\nthe Gulf crisis, hour after hour, Saddam who had not  \" changed from\nbad old days\"  , the disappearance of the Wall and the German\nreunification. \n\n \n\nAt  Croft Club where \nson-in-law lived, now a very academic place, we discussed  Troilus and\nCressida  a play that we watched at the Swan theatre.\n\n\nThere was heated discussion on  infidelity.\n\n\nIt looked as if Cressida played by Amanda Root came alive to the\ndiscussion table, the Greeks and Trojans were imagined to be haunting and\nalive, as alive as the American troops around the Gulf.\n\n\nThe discussion highlighted passages of moral truths and political\nwisdom, the  speech on degree and the universal obligation\nof the law of order which when disturbed lead to chaos. \n\n \n\nWith business slowly fading into pleasure we went to\nShakespeare centre were there is a blind statue of the poet,\nsymbolising an eternal inward eye, a well stocked library where one could\nfeel, as if the ashes of Shakespeare kept perched in the urns among the book\nshelves were burning.\n\n\nThe members of the conference cut across a wide range of disciplines\nwhich explains the absence fo intellectual parochialism and professional\njealousy one normally encountters at meetings of similar organisations.\n\n\nHence the topics of discussion acquired topical interest : \n\" Shylock and the discourse of terrorism\"  ,  \" Julius Ceasar\nand the conspriators\"  ,  \" Macbeth and MacBird : the dark\nside of human nature.\"  \n\n \n\n MacBird  by Barbara Garson is a political satire in the\nmodel of Aristophanes written to shock respectability of President Johnson\nand his involvement in the Vietnam during the latter part of the  .\n\n\nIt is indebted to  Macbeth  .\n\n\nDiscussions embodied references to the events of the day - - the\nGulf crisis and the German reunification.\n\n\nEven the production of  King Lear  had a slight stint\ntowards contempo rary events. \n\n \n\nThe Stratford  Lear  was visibly happier to present the\ndivision of the kingdom as a family row rather than a conclusion of State.\n\n\nThe Director, Nicholas Hytner, was clearly interested in the dynastic\ndimension : the power-struggle between the  daughters and\ntheir faction in Act Four goes for little. \n\n \n\nThe politics of the family were another matter, and the first two\nacts offered some penetrating suggestions.\n\n\nUnlike Peter  production of 1962, which    was famous for refusing to endorse  claim\nthat he is a man more sinned against than sinning and for suggesting that\nthere might be something to be said for Goneril and Regan after all.\n\n\nAs now played by Estelle Kohler and Sally Dexter, they were certainly\nmore psychologically plausible than the pelican daughters of tradition.\n\n\n \n\n  IT   would have been strange,\nof course, if an English Sunday paper would not have carried an article about\nGermany or the Gulf crisis.\n\n\nThe  \" Sunday Times \"  , however, seemed to\nhave difficulties to mention the rest of the world at all.\n\n\nBut  cricket performance received its share.\n\n\nThe news review section devoted almost a full page to a laudation of\nthe German ambassador in London and middle page describing Saddam Hussain\nas  \" a wolf with manicured claws\"  and sanctions against\nIraq. \n\n \n\nThere was some praise for  King  abortive peace efforts.\n\n\nBut I was puzzled at the laudatory article on Kohl - - and certainly\nnot in an English newspaper about a German politician.\n\n\n portrait was of his having borrowed his cigar from\nChurchhill, his sword from    Harun-ul-Rashid\n  , and his hat from Roosevelt.\n\n\nHe deserves the attack for having disturbed the wrld. \n\n \n\nI turned the page only to encounter the Nicholas Garland cartoon\nof Chancellor Kohl a Hitler moustache and a slapdash lock for hair which\naccompanied the  \" Spectator \"  interview with\nNicholas Ridley which caused his downfall probably more than the outrageous\nwords which he had uttered. \n\n \n\nBut that was not the end of the teutomania or obsession with the\nGulf to the exclusion of other world news which the  \" Sunday\nTimes \"  displayed.\n\n\nThe focus section contained not less than two pages in which \n\" five eminent young Germans\"  were giving advice to the British\nPrime Minister how to run Britain in a more efficient way, in other words,\nhow to imitate the sucessful Germans. \n\n \n\nThe word  \" ougrageous\"  renders the tone of\nthe article itself.\n\n\nMy German colleagues found what Ridley said almost refreshing and\nmore honest than the diplomatic statements one is likely to hear over the\nradio and television. \n\n \n\nThere we were in Stratford without an Indian newspaper we did not\nneed it.\n\n\nThe English papers were full of German and the Gulf stuff.\n\n\nI was reminded of a character in  \"  Well\nthat Ends Well  \" ,  \" Is not a language I speak? - - A\nmost harsh one.\" \n\n\nAt Stratford, Lafeu did not recognise us talk about harsh language\nenough for academic discussion, applying Shakespeare to contemporary\nevents. \n\n \n\nFrom a French colleague, I borrowed  \" Paris-March\n\"  once again to read of Chancellor Kohl and Saddam Hussein who\ndominated the Western press : one is praised and the other is blamed.\n\n\nThe entire society is to be viewed as a scene from shakespeare.\n\n\nFor one who participated in the conference on  \" Shakespeare\nand Politics\"  , the world scene gathered from the English\nnewspapers, can be summed up in  wise saying, \n\" I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy.\"  \n\n \n\n  ALTHOUGH   the spirit of the\ntext was violated, one felt the relevance of Shakespeare to \nworld.\n\n\nOne of the strengths of John   Lear  was that\nhe made it immediately clear that the old man was becoming - - has\nprobably long been - - impossible to live with.\n\n\nIt was made out that the way the sisters behaved was his fault.\n\n\nAs in Shakespeare  Lear  had lost his marbles, and the power\nof intellectual consistency. \n\n \n\nHowever, the insanity that John Wood so intellilgently\nsignalled proved disappointing in the theatrical event because it became\nincreasingly difficult to distinguish between the self regard of the\ncharacter and that of the actor playing him.\n\n\nThere was a lack of emotional penetration in the reunion with\nCordelia and fine moment of speculative in tensity when he talked of\nhim self and Cordelia being  spies, prepared to take  the mystery of things; but not enough sense, earlier of a sudden\naccess of compassion for the poor naked wretches caught in the pitiless\nstorm. \n\n \n\nHe was clearly fascinated by the unaccommodated man that Edgar\nhas made himself into, but the tone of  \" Is man no more than this?\"\n was rather one of academic interest than of mystical insight or\nappalled revelation.\n\n\n \" As flies to boys are we to the Gods?\"  indicates\nthe helplessness of its victims, and the  almost\nintolerable extremism. \n\n \n\n violent speeches, the  gigantism,\nits expansiveness and its implied lesson of abdication came close to the\nmodern thinking.\n\n\nWalking out of the theatre and musing on the deeply felt episodes,\nsauntering along the river Thames and watching the swans swimming and the\nmemorial to Shakespeare with some of his characters all around the Hamlet,\nin particular, with the  skull in hand philosophising\nmade us forget the  chores but the political events\ndemonstrated that the heads which wore the crown were uneasy. \n\n \n\nWhen I came to my lodging, I came across copies of the  Times\n .\n\n\nOne of our British colleagues had told us that on Sundays an\nintellectual had to read the  \" Times \"  and the\nnewly launched  \" The Independent \"  .\n\n\nThe world news section of the  \" Times \" \ncarried an article on Helmut Kohl with the heading  \" Kohl gets\nbigger every day.\" \n\n\nIt was wisely timed because the German Chancellor had gone from the\nCaucasus to Lake Wolfgangsee in Austria where he tries to lose weight and\nnormally succeeds for a week or two. \n\n \n\nAll world politicians in power take a holiday.\n\n\nPresident George Bush goes to the family seaside holiday home at\nMaine, where he heard the disturbing news from the Gulf and others have their\nplaces of choice.\n\n\nNo irony could be found in the article on Kohl.\n\n\nHowever, it was full of admiration and praise for the man who was\nemerging with startling rapidity as  Number One.\n\n\nThis was corroborated with glee by my German colleague and who\nlike other intellectuals believed in the dictum of Arnold that the moment\nproduces the man.\n\n\nThere is Kohl on the tide of history. \n\n \n\nOn the same page John Cassidly was reporting from New York\nthat the Caucasus conference had put American noses out of joint and had\ncreated a new Raphallo - - like arrangement between Bonn and Moscow.\n\n\nOnce again I was looking in vain for a glance of irony or a grain of\ncriticism.\n\n\nRather, so it seemed to me did the author express a certain \n Schadenfreude   because Germany now seemed to be\nable to achieve what England could not do after the second world war : it\nemancipates itself from American supremacy.  \n\n \n\n\n  Eternal friends, natural partners    <*> thick blue line below  name </*>\n\n \n\n Financial  and commercial ties are important.\n\n\nBut infinitely more important are cultural and spiritual ties which\ncannot be measured in terms of money.\n\n\nOf all our trading partners Japan has the closest cultural and\nspiritual ties with India.\n\n\nNow that India has adopted globalization as its official policy, this\nis the time to strengthen the bonds between the two countries which are\n \" eternal friends, natural partners\"  in the words of Toshio\nYamanouchi. \n\n \n\nIt is remarkable how many common creative wavelengths have\nbeen sought over the centuries by Japan and India.\n\n\nBetween the two countries we can complete the Story of the Beautiful\n- - hewn in the marbles of the Taj Mahal and embroidered with birds and\nflowers upon the fan of Hokusai at the foot of Fujiyama. \n\n \n\nThe Japanese have studied our civilization and absorbed its\nvalues.\n\n\nWe would be well advised to study their civilization and\nassimilate its values.\n\n\nWhat a transformation would take place on the Indian scene if we\nhad the humility to learn and translate into action the priceless lessons\nwhich Japan has to teach us.\n\n\nFor instance, we should study carefully the Japanese system of\npartnership between the public and private sectors and between the\nemployer and the employee. \n\n \n\nAgain, there is no highly developed country where litigation\nis so infrequent as it is in Japan.\n\n\nThe total number of lawyers in that country being only 14,000, there\nis no lawyer-stimulated litigation. \n\n \n\nJapan has a history, as interesting and variegated as that of\nIndia, going back about 2,600 years.\n\n\nIn the nineteenth century, Japan effectively abolished feudalism,\nserfdom, and slavery, as it was abolished in France in 1789, in Russia in\n1862, and in the USA in 1863.\n\n\nIn India, slavery and untouchability have been abolished only on\npaper by the Constitution in 1950.\n\n\nThe ambition of Japan now is to be transformed from a mere economic\npowerhouse into a  \" lifestyle superpower\"  by the early\ntwenty-first century. \n\n \n\nThe two largest democraies of Asia are Japan and India.\n\n\nUnfortunately, neither has great moral leadership at present, (\nfor that master, no democracy in the world has today great moral\nleadership.)\n\n\nBut in Japan this desideratum does not have discernible ill-effects\nbecause the people are totally disciplined,  characterised\nby exemplary dedication, and there is hundred per cent literacy.\n\n\nBy contract, we Indians, who lack discipline and dedication and\nhave at least half of our population literally illiterate, find ourselves\nrudderless in the absence of moral leadership. \n\n \n\nWe suffer acutely from four plagues - - regionalism,\ncommunalism, casteism, and corruption.\n\n\nThere are various categories of democracies - - democracies, guided\ndemocracies, and misguided democracies.\n\n\nThe four plagues have made it possible for self-seeking politicians\nto convert our democracy into a misguided democracy.\n\n\nIndia produced Mahatma Gandhi, the greatest moral force of this\ncentury, but today it is pathetically lacking even in mediocre moral\nleadership. \n\n \n\nSome years ago, when the population of India was a little over\n600 million and that of Japan 100 million, the then Japanese Ambassador\ndelivered a frank talk in Bombay and invited questions from the audience.\n\n\nA young Indian got up and asked,  \" We Indians are no less\nintelligent than you the Japanese; how is it that you are on top of the world\nand we are still     wallowing in poverty?\" \n\n\nThe amlbassador gave a very pithy and pregnant answer,  \"\nMy young friend, the explanation is simple.\n\n\nIn Japan we have 100 million  citizens  ; in India you\nhave 600 million  individuals  .\"  \n\n \n\nThe Japanese are, by nature, clean, honest and like to remain on\nthe right side of the law.\n\n\nCleanliness comes as naturally to the Japanese as filth and\nslovenliness come to large segments of the Indian people.\n\n\nSeven hundred and fifty million Indians live with no access to basic\nsanitation, according to the latest Human Development Report of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme.\n\n\nBy temperament the Japanese are lawabiding.\n\n\nA historian wrote some years ago:  \" I have lived in\ndistricts where no case of theft had occurred for hundreds of years, where\nthe newly-built prisons of Meiji remained empty and useless\". \n\n\n \n\nIt can be said without exaggeration that of all the resources\nwith which a national can be blessed, the most valuable, in fact the\ninvaluable, resource is the character of the people.\n\n\nAmong the economically dynamic nations of the world, Japan is\ntragically the poorest in fuels and minerals which are indispensable to\nindustry.\n\n\nBut it more than makes up for this deficiency by the character of\nthe people.\n\n\nTheirs is a homogeneous society with total dedication to their\nmotherland and an unmatched work ethic.\n\n\nThey had the good sense to have ethical socialism which inculcate\nsocial justice to all strata of society, and they practised ethical socialism\nduring the four decades that India practised ideological socialism which\nkept us mired in poverty and squalor.\n\n\nAs Ambassador Shunji Kobayashi pointed out three years ago, the\nadvantage of a low wage level in India is unfortunately offset by the low\nproductivity level, and an irrational  \" exit\"  policy which\nresults in labour being treated like spoilt children, ( Unfortunately,\ndespite verbal assurances to the contrary, the same pernicious exit policy\nstill continues). \n\n \n\nJapanese manners are a model of diplomatic courtesy.\n\n\nIn Japan a formal humility clothes a fierce    \nself-respect.\n\n\nAs Will Durant points out, the typical Japanese has all the\nqualities of a warrior - - pugnacity and courage, and unrivalled readiness\nto die; and yet, very often, he has the soul of an artist - - sensuous,\nimpressionable and almost instinctively possessed of taste.\n\n\nHe is sober and unostentatious, frugal and industrious, curious and\nstudious, loyal and patient.\n\n\nHe has a nimble intelligence, not highly creative in the field of\nthought but capable of quick comprehension, adaptation and practical\nachievement.\n\n\nHe transforms creatively what he absorbs through imitation.\n\n\nFlowers are the religion of the Japanese; they worship them with\nsacrificial fervour. \n\n \n\nBuddhism which originated in India 2,600 years ago, spread\nthrough China for five centuries and then, in the sixth century A.D., it made\nrapid conquest of Japan. \n\n \n\nThere are over one hundred Buddhist sects and groups in Japan\nand there are 75,000 Buddhist temples.\n\n\nOut of a total population of 123 million, no less than 75 million\nare Buddhists.\n\n\nOut of ancestral worship came the older living religion of Japan - -\nShinto - - the Way of the Gods.\n\n\nThe majority of the Japanese believe both in Buddhism and in\ntheir ancient religion, Shintoism.\n\n\nThey are generally taken by their parents to be blessed in Shinto\nshrines at birth but are given Buddhist funerals when they die. \n\n \n\nIf only Indian authorities had any imagination and sensitivity,\nwe would be flooded by a large inflow of Japanese tourists who are keenly\ninterested in visiting places of interest associated with the Buddha.\n\n\nBut the sad fact is that out of eleven million japanese citizens who\ntravel abroad every year, less than one  lakh  come to India.\n\n\n \n\nI have no doubt that a closer contact with Japan would not only\nenrich India economically but enrich Indian life.\n\n\nIt would serve as a cleansing influence on our polluted environment\nand filthy public places.\n\n\nIt would also uplift our national character and refine our religious\nsensitivity to the point where we can have religion in place of religiosity.\n\n\nIt would also bring home to us the vital difference between\nsocialism and social justice.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "52508109-e2b7-4742-a645-e643fe115f7b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.048967+00:00"}

{"text": "Solid Wastes and Their Disposal in Rourkela - - A\nPreliminary Survey     T. N. Tiwari and M.\nK. Patel    Regional Engineering College,\nEnvironmental Engineering Laboratory, Department of Physics, Rourkela  -\n769 008 \n\n \n\n Rourkela, with an estimated population of 350,000, is the\nmost important industrial city in the mineral rich state of Orissa.\n\n\nIn addition to two large industries, namely steel and fertilisers, the\nRourkela Industrial Complex also contains many medium industries and\nnearly three hundred small-scale units.\n\n\nThus Rourkela offers an excellent opportunity for the study of\nenvironmental pollution and its management, and the experience gained here\nmay be useful in the planning of future industrial towns.\n\n\nKeeping this in view, we have undertaken an on - - going study of the\nenvironmental pollution in this steel city.\n\n\nWe report in this paper the results of our preliminary survey of solid\nwastes and their disposal in Rourkela.\n\n\nThis survey, conducted over a period of two years ( 1987-1989 ) ,\ncovers domestic wastes, refuse from hospitals, markets, community centres,\netc., and industrial wastes.\n\n\nWe discuss here the estimated quantity of solid wastes from these\nsources, methods currently used for the collection and disposal of wastes,\nthe potential for land pollution, and future trends in the generation and\ndisposal of solid wastes in Rourkela.   \n\n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nWaste has been a part of human activity since time immemorial.\n\n\nBaking of bricks for the Great Wall of China, for example, saw the\nend of forests all around, thus damaging the environment and\nimpoverishing that country.\n\n\nIn the earlier times, however, the population was small, needs were\nfew, resources were abundant and the generation of waste was less.\n\n\nMoreover, these wastes got naturally recycled, since they were mostly\nbiodegradable.\n\n\nDuring this century, however, the resources have been recklessly\nused and this has given rise to the generation of very diverse types of\nwastes which are often hazardous as well as non-biodegradable.\n\n\nSince the ecosystem cannot absorb them in the natural course, the\npiling of such wastes poses a serious environmental problem and it may\neven affect the stability of the biosphere. \n\n \n\nDuring the last two decades or so, it has become clear that the\nresources of the world are limited.\n\n\nIn order to maintain a stable economic growth and a reasonably high\nstandard of living, therefore, it is very necessary that we use the available\nresources very carefully and evolve suitable technologies for the recycling\nof wastes to save both resources and energy.\n\n\nFor a resourceful society, nothing is really waste.\n\n\nIn fact,  waste may be regarded as  raw material.\n\n\nIn some situations, however, waste can be a big health hazard and\nmust be disposed off properly, for example by sanitary land fill.\n\n\nIn the following sections, we examine the problem of wastes in India\nand then discuss the generation and disposal of solid wastes - - both\nmunicipal and industrial - - in Rourkela. \n\n\n  WASTE IN INDIA  \n\n \n\nSolid wastes may be defined as <quote > ` useless, unwanted or\ndiscarded materials that arise from  activities and are not\nfree-flowing'  ( WHO expert Committee,1971 ) .\n\n\nThe extraction and processing of industrial raw materials produces\nfar greater quantities of solid waste than come from homes.\n\n\nHowever, of all the materials with which an engineer has to deal,\nperhaps least is known about solid wastes, even in developed countries.\n\n\nIn India, a comprehensive Staatus Report on Utilisation and\nRecycling of Wastes was prepared in 1975 by the National Committee on Science\nand Technology of the Government of India.\n\n\nAlthough much effort had gone in the preparation of this report, not\nmuch follow-up action has been taken so far on its recommendations.\n\n\nA survey of <O> <*> line from left to right</*>  \nliterature revealed, moreover, that very little information is available\non the extent and nature of wastes in India ( Anon, 1970; Bhide  et\nal.,  1972; Vimal, 1977; Vimal and Talashilkar, 1984; Vimal and\nTyagi, 1982; Mall and Upadhyay, 1988; Jain and Sharma, 1988; Moitra and\nPandey, 1989 ) . \n\n \n\nBy proper recycling and utilisation of waste materials, it is\npossible to conserve the national resources, reduce the cost of production in\nmany cases, solve the problem of environmental pollution to some extent\nand generate some employment.\n\n\nDuring the last decades, waste recycling and reuse has been one of\nthe major activities in most of the developed countries and considerable\nprogress has been achieved.\n\n\nIn India and other developing nations too, there is an urgent need\nnow for an intensive research and development effort in this area.\n\n\nHaving the vast \" R and D \" infrastructure and the\nthird  largest scientific and technical manpower in the world,\nIndia has the potential to become a world leader in this relatively new field\nof waste recycling. \n\n \n\nDepending on their origin, the wastes may be grouped into the\nfollowing 7 categories ( Khoshoo, 1986 ) : \" Agricultural wastes\n\" , \" Fruit and vegetable wastes \" , \"\nAnimal wastes\", \" Aquatic weeds \" , \"\nCommunity wastes \" , \" lndustrial wastes \" , and\n\" Construction materials \" from wastes.\n\n\nSome typical examples of various types of wastes are given in table\n1.\n\n\nWhile waste utilisation is a high technology area in developed\ncountries, in many cities of developing countries ( including India ) garbage\nis sorted out by hand for materials such as tin, glass, paper, plastics, rags\nand bones.\n\n\nThese generate new materials and also some employment.\n\n\nIn fact, there has been a regular market in India for a long time for\nwaste paper, rags and empty glass bottles.\n\n\nThus the basic idea of recycling is already present in our\nsociety; but by and large waste utilisation on a wider scale has not taken\nroot in our country.   \n\n\n  ROURKELA lNDUSTRIAL COMPEX  \n\n \n\nRourkela is a one of the important industrial towns in India.\n\n\nIt is situated approximately 415 km south-west of Calcutta on the\nCalcutta - - Bombay railway line.\n\n\nTha current population of Rourkela, estimated by extrapolating the\ndata of 1981 census, is roughly 350,000 and its area is 121.7 km2.\n\n\nIt is situated in close proximity to iron ore, dolomite and coal\nbelts.\n\n\nThe integrated steel plant at Rourkela ( with a rated capacity of\n1.8 MT ) was constructed in the late 1950s with the assistance from the\nFederal Republic of Germany.\n\n\nIn addition two heavy industries, namely steel and fertilisers,\nthe Rourkela Industrial Complex also contains almost 300 small-scale\nunits.\n\n\nSome other large and medium industries in and around Rourkela are :\n\" Orissa Cement Ltd., \" Rajgangpur; \" Orissa\nIndustries Ltd., \" Lathikata; \" Bisra Stone Ltd., \"\nBirmitrapur; \" Utkal Machinery Ltd., \" Kansbahal; \"\nIDL Chemicals Ltd., \" Rourkela; \" Orissa Fertilisers\n\" and \" Chemicals Ltd., \" Kalunga; and \"\nBlast Furnace Slag Cement Plants \" at Kalunga and Rajgangpur.\n\n\nRourkela is, in fact, the most important growth centre for\nancillary industries in Orissa. \n\n \n\nDue to the presence of a large number of heavy, medium and\nsmall-scale industrial units, Rourkela presents a unique opportunity for the\nstudy of environmental pollution.\n\n\nHowever, the experience gained at Rourkela regarding the\nmanagement of environmental pollution may be useful in the planning of\nfuture industrial towns in India.\n\n\nIn spite of such crucial importance of Rourkela from the point of\nview of environmental studies, a survey of literature revealed that hardly\nany work had been done to assess the extent of environmental pollution in\nthis idustrial city.\n\n\nIn order to remedy this situation, one  of\nthe present authors ( Tiwari ) and his coworkers embarked on an ambitious\nprogramme to make an exhaustive and on-going study of environmental pollution\nin Rourkela ( Tiwari  et al.,  1987; Patel and Tiwari, 1989; Ali and\nTiwari, 1988; Tiwari and Ali, 1988; Tiwari and Patel, 1989; Tiwari, 1989 ) .\n\n\nAs a part of this project, we report here the results of our\npreliminary survey of the generation and disposal of solid wates in Rourkela.\n\n\n\n  MUNICIPAL WASTES  \n\n \n\nThe preliminary survey of municipal wastes in Rourkela\nreported in this paper was conducted over a period of 2 year ( Jan., 1988 to\nDec., 1989 ) .\n\n\nThe main results of this survey are summarised in table 2.\n\n\nThe total quantity of solid wastes collected during the period of\nsurvey was estimated from the number of trips made by the garbage\ncollecting trucks and the approximate amount of garbage taken in each trip.\n\n\nIt was found that the municipal refuse collected during the year 1988\nwas roughly 33,000 tonne, while that during 1989 was approximately 29,OOO\ntonne.\n\n\nlt was observed during our survey that ragpickers are quite active in\nRourkela.\n\n\nEven before the garbage is collected by the trucks for disposal,\nthe rag-pickers go through the piles of garbage and collect \"\nempty glass bottles \" , \" broken pieces of glass \"\n, \" rags \" , \" plastics \" , \"\npolyethylene bags \" , and \" metallic objects \" .\n\n\n\" The vegetable and fruit peels \" and \"\nother edible wastes \" are eaten by roaming cows, pigs and dogs\nbefore the garbage is collected for disposal.\n\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon observed during this survey was that\nthe roaming cows of Rourkela eat with great relish the pieces of paper found\nin the garbage or anywhere else.\n\n\nSo the quantity of collected garbage mentioned earlier does not\ninclude the items collected by rag-pickers or eaten by roaming animals. \n \n\n \n\nThe garbage collected by the municipal authorities may be roughly\nclassified into two groups, namely ( 1) \" infectious refuse\n\" , and ( 2) \" non-infectious refuse \" .\n\n\n\" Infectious refuse \" comes from hospitals,\ndispensaries and markets.\n\n\n\" Non-infectious refuse \" , on the other hand,\nconsists of the refuse coming from homes, streets and gardens.\n\n\nThe refuse is collected from all the sectors of Rourkela ( including\nlabour colonies ) and Fertiliser Township, hospitals, markets, community\ncentres, bus garage and Trainee Hostels.\n\n\nThe methods of disposal of the two types of wastes are different.\n\n\n\" The infectious refuse \" is dumped in an old and\ndiscarded brick kiln beyond Koel Nagar on the outskirts of Rourkela and\ncovered with soil.\n\n\nDry, \" non-infectious refuse \" , on the other hand,\nis dumped in the low-lying areas of the Town, with proper co-ordination\nbetween the Land Section and Town Engineering Section of the Rourkela\nSteel Plant.\n\n\nSuch garbage is dumped at present behind the \" Ispat Stadium\n\" and adjacent areas.\n\n\nIn dry seasons, some of the garbage is burnt on roadside instead\nof being collected.\n\n\nIt was found that the quantity of refuse collected from July to\nDecember is almost double the amount collected from January to June in\neach year.\n\n\nThis extra \" refuse \" mostly consists of garden\nwastes, such as bushes and tree cuttings, during the rainy seasons and the\nmonths following it. \n\n\n  BLAST FURNACE SLAG  \n\n \n\nRourkela Steel Plant was the first integrated steel plant in\nIndia in the public sector.\n\n\nThis plant caters to a varied and wide spectrum of consumers,\nstarting from \" household wares \" and \"\nagricultural implements \" to heavy and core industries, ship\nbuilding, boilers, defence, railways, automobiles, electrical equipments, oil\ntransportation and chemical industries.\n\n\nThe rated capacity of \" Rourkela Steel Plant \" is\n1.8 MT.\n\n\nIf the plant runs at full capacity, the annual productction of blast\nfurnace slag would be about  700,000 tonne per\nyear.\n\n\nThe approximate chemical composition of blast furnace slag is shown\nin table 3.\n\n\nPrior to 1977, this huge amount of blast furnace slag was dumped\nas waste material.\n\n\nIt was decided, however, to install a Slag Granulation Plant to make\nuse of practically the entire amount of slag produced by the blast furnaces.\n\n\nSuch a plant, with an annual capacity of 600,000 tonne, was set up in\n1977 at an estimated cost of Rs 3.86  crore.    \n\n \n\nCement is one of the core raw materials for a developing\ncountry like India and it plays a vital role in the economic growth of the\ncountry.\n\n\nGranulated blast furnance slag is an excellent input material for\ncement production and can replace the main ingredient - - the clinker - -\nup to 50-60%.\n\n\nThe use of granulated slag for cement production results in\nsignificant cost reduction in cement industry as well as steel industry.\n\n\nIt also results in marked conservation of limestone - - a basic\nraw material for both of these industries.\n\n\nA small amount of granulated slag, moreover, can also be a substitute\nfor lime in fertiliser industry. \n\n \n\nSome of the important cement factories which have successfully\nused the granulated slag from Rourkela on commerical scale are \"\nAndhra Cement Ltd., \" Vijayawada; \" Rohtas Industries\n\" , Dalmianagar and \" Orissa Cement Ltd., \"\nRajgangpur.\n\n\nSeveral other cement companies have also shown interest in the\ngranulated blast furnace slag from Rourkela.\n\n\nThus, instead of being a \" solid waste \"\ncontributing to environmental pollution, the \" blast furnace slag\n\" from the \" Rourkela Steel Plant \" will result in\nadditional availability of over 1.2 MT of \" Portland Blast Furnace\nSlag \" cement to the country every year.\n\n\nWe note here that only the \" blast furnace slag \" is\nutilised for granulation and subsequent cement production.\n\n\nThe slag produced in the steel melting shop ( SMS ) contains a higher\npercentage of iron and is, therefore, not useful as a raw material for\n\" Portland cement industry \" .\n\n\nThe \" SMS slag \" is taken at present to the dumping\nyard and collected later by private parties for use in mini steel plants.\n\n\n\n  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  \n\n \n\nThe authors are

{"text": "LEGAL EFFORTS AND PROGRAMMES FOR\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION  \n\n \n\n generation is going through a valuable phase.\n\n\nNature and environment, which gave birth to man and nursed him, is in\nperil.\n\n\nEnvironmental preservations, on which the very existence of mankind is\ndependent, is posing an overriding challenge to him.\n\n\nEnvironmental degradation is not a new problem.\n\n\nIt has been arising ever since the human civilization began on earth\nand man began to exploit the natural resources for his survival.\n\n\nBut at that time the population was not so imposing a problem as it is\nnow.\n\n\nTherefore, environment was not much affected.\n\n\nWith the arrival of Western Culture in India, consumerist culture\nbegan to flourish, and worked havoc on environment. \n\n \n\nNature and environment was given great importance from the\nRigvedic period to the medieval period.\n\n\n A Sulkta  ( Verse ) of Rigveda states that,  \" The\nsky is like a father, the earth is like a mother and the space like their\nson.\n\n\nThis, universe consisting of three is like a family.\n\n\nAny kind of damage to any one of the three throws the universe off\nbalance.\"  .\n\n\nThe aim in giving such messages was to warn people of the hazards  of environmental pollutiion.\n\n\nIn  ` Chanakya  Niti  '  , it is said\nthat planting even a single tree with fruits and flowers makes the\nenvironment full of fragrance just as a family becomes delighted with a\nworthy son.\n\n\nHence, we will be safe, so far the earth is full of nature. \n\n\n  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION : WHOSE CONCERN ?  : \n\n \n\nThe term environment includes water, air, land and human beings\nand other living creatures.\n\n\n ` Environmental Pollutant'  or  ` hazardous\nsubstance'  means \" any solid, liquid or gas in such\nconcentration as may be injurious to environment or any substance which by\nvirtue of its chemical or physical properties is liable to cause harm to\nenvironment. \n\n \n\nThe Central Government has been given power to  \" take all\nsuch measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the people of protecting\nand improving the quality of the environment\"  and preventing\nenvironmental pollution.\n\n\nIt can lay down standards for quality of environment / emissions or\ndischarge of pollutants, specify areas where certain industries shall not be\nlocated and in other cases may lay down procedures and safeguards for\nprevention of accidents that may cause environmental pollution.\n\n\nThe government may aso examine manufacturing or other processes that\ncan cause pollution, inspect, investigate and carry out related research\nbesides establishing / recognising environmental laboratories and\ninstitutions to carry out functions entrusted  under\nthe Act.\n\n\nThere is heavy punishment for contravention of the Act, rules,\ndirectiion in the form of \" fines or imprisonment, or both\n\" , irrespective of the fact that the defaulter is a firm, company\nor government department.\n\n\nThe Government, if it deems fit, may direct closure, prohibition, or\nregulation of an industry, operation and process or that of any service such\nas electricity, water, etc. \n\n\n  GOVERNMENT LEGAL EFFORTS AND PROGRAMMES TO CONTROL THE\nENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION  \n\n \n\nThere are more than 200 Central and state laws today that can be\ninterpreted one way or other to protect the environment.\n\n\nThe earliest of them, the Shore Nuisance ( Bombay and Kolaba ) Act\ndates back to 1853.\n\n\nBut laws enacted with the specific intention of controlling\nenvironmental degradation have been slow coming, partly because of inadequate\nappreciations of environmental problems and partly because of wrong notions\nabout legislative competence. \n\n \n\nUntil 1976, environment protection as such did not figure\nanywhere in the Constitution.\n\n\nIn the 7th schedule, which classifies various legislative    entries   into three groups, \" the Union\nList, the State List, and the Concurrent List, \" there are various\nentries like forests and wildlife related to environment.\n\n\nOn the fact of it, it seemed that state legislatures alone are\nempowered to legslate on some of the most vital matters    affecting   environment.  \n\n\n  CONSTITUTION AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISIONS  : \n\n \n\nWhen the Constitution was amended for the 42nd time in 1976,\ncertain environmental provisions were incorporated.\n\n\nFor the first time the expression  \" environmental protection\"\n found a place and this led many scholars to argue that by 42nd\namendment, the Central Government wanted certain powers which it did not have\nto protect the environment.\n\n\nBut this was not true. \n\n\n  DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY  : \n\n \n\nArticle 48 A was added to the \" Directive Principles of\nState Policy \" and stated :  \" The State shall endeavour to\nprotect and improve the natural environment and safeguard the forest and\nwildlife in the country\"  .\n\n\nIn the chapter on \" fundamental duties \" , which\nitself was inserted into the constitution for the first, Article 51 A(g)\nprovided :  \" It shall be the duty of every citizen of Indian to\nprotect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes,\nrivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures\"  .\n\n\nBesides this, the entries dealing with  ` forests' \nand  ` wildlife' <w> were dropped from the \" State List\n\" and inserted in the \" concurrent list \" . \n\n\n\n  SELECTIVE LIST OF ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION  : \n\n \n\nPowers to legislate on industry, mines and minerals, oil fields,\nfishing, inter-state rivers and river valleys have been assigned to the\nCentral Government under \" List-I \" , and further, it has\nbeen authorised to social planning under \" concurrent list-III\n\" of Schedule VII of the Constitution.\n\n\nThe State Government can also legislate on industry, mines and\nminerals, fisheries, but subject to the provisions of the central\nlegislation.\n\n\nExercising the powers conferred by the constitutions, the Central\nGovernment has passed many laws.\n\n\nSome of the main laws passed are as follows : \n\n\n  SELECTION LIST OF ENVIRONMENT RELATED LEGISLATION : CENTRAL\nENACTMENTS  : \n\n\n1.

D.\nTiwari to recommend legislative measures and administrative machinery to\nensure environmental protection.\n\n\nThe committee submitted its report on September 15, 1980 and made\n   far   reaching recommendations on administrative\nand legislative measures for environment protection. \n\n \n\nA careful study of \" Tiwari Committee \"\nsuggests that the legislations passed so far are either inadequate or\ndefective in the following respects, thus : \n\n\n1. They are not comprehensive in their approach.\n\n\n2. They are fragmented, separated and segregated.\n\n\n3. Controlling specific types of pollution rather than preserving\nand protecting the environment.\n\n\n4. Laws are cumbersome rather than streamlined, simple and\nunderstandable to common man.\n\n\n5. Few of the laws are outdated. \n\n \n\nBesides bringing these defects to the surface, the Committee\nalso recommended :\n\n\n1. The creation of a separate Department of Environment at the\nCentre.\n\n\n2. The creation of posts of Environmental Advisors in all the\nministries.\n\n\n3. Constitution of a  ` Cabinet Sub-Committee'  on\nthe environment under the Chairmanship of Prime-Minister, and\n\n\n4. Review of Central and State laws on environmental management.\n\n\n5. Public Awareness and Public Participation should be made two\nmajor and key elements while making any environmental policy, planning or\nmanagement.\n\n\n6. To enact, and have an umbrella legislation which should take care\nof  the  entire problems of pollution under one  root. <->  roof\n   \n\n \n\nIn order to fulfil the recommendations of the \" Tiwari\nCommittee \" , the separate Department of Environment, Forest and\nWild Life was created in 1985.\n\n\nWhen Late Mr. Rajiv Gandhi came to power he created two high power\nagencies namely \" The National Waste Land Development Board ( NWLDB)\n\" and \" The Central Ganga Authority ( CGA) \" to\ntackle specific environmental problems.\n\n\nMr. Rajiv Gandhi was one with nature, fully devoted to the cause of\nenvironment.\n\n\nHe was strongly of the view that come what may, we should never\ncompromise any thing at the cost of environment.\n\n\nMr. Rajiv Gandhi noticed that inspite of number of legislations,\nsuitable provisions for conservation and enhancement of environment in\n5th, 6th and 7th Five Year Plans, there seems a contining decline in the\nquality of the environment, the Bhopal tragedy which killed more than 2,700\npeople and injured over 20,000 people, aggravated the problem.\n\n\nTo combat all these new Act in 1986 which is known as \" The\nEnvironment ( Protection) Act \" came into force.\n\n\nThis was the first direct legislation passed by the Government of\nIndia    on   the basis of the  resolutions\npassed in 1972 at Stockholm  at a \" world conference on Human\nEnvironment. \" \n\n\n  SUSTAINABLE ALL ROUND DEVELOPMENT  : \n\n \n\nRecently, Government of India has amended the  ` Wild\nLife Act'  and notified a new  ` Eco-Mark Scheme'  .\n\n\nThey have also made  Environmental Audit  mandatory for all\nprojects.\n\n\nThey  have also established a  ` Zoo\nAuthority of India'  .\n\n\nTaking into consideration, the above legal provision, it seems that\nIndian Government is well aware of the environmental degradation.\n\n\nHowever, there is lack of awareness of law even in educated as well\nas uneducated people of our country.\n\n\nKnowledge today is a major source of power and control.\n\n\nThe producers of knowledge are called \" researchers\n\" and social sciences    have   become a\nfull-fledged enterprise.\n\n\nAt one time it was thought that State was mainly concerned with\nmaintenance of law and order but such a restrictive role of the State is no\nlonger a valid concept.\n\n\nThe function of the law a country like India is not merely to solve\nand adjust disputes, guide human conduct but also to achieve economic and\nsocial justice.\n\n\nThus, today, the law is that which sustains society.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5eda868a-3801-4f33-9624-70d9c386eccf", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.053168+00:00"}
{"text": "THE WEEKLY COVER STORY \n\n\n<@AS> SAILESH KOTTARY {#}\n\n\n LARSEN AND TOUBRO \n\n\n A NEW CORPORATE BATTLE HITS THE HEADLINES  \n           \n                        \n        \n\n \n\nYet another corporate war has moved on to the front page. \n\n \n\nThe target:  finest and most diversified\nengineering company, Larsen & Toubro.\n\n\nWith a turnover of Rs 1100  crores  .\n\n\nAnd assets estimated at Rs 800  crores  . \n\n \n\nIts first wooers - - the Chhabrias - - lost out to the Ambanis,\nwho acquired the cash-rich company, allegedly with the support of the Rajiv\ngovernment.\n\n\nAided and abetted by the financial institutions.\n\n\nThat is what claims the Indian Express - - and its favourite\ncolumnist, S Gurumurthy, who has tormented the Ambanis for three long years\nnow.\n\n\nOn behalf of their business rival, the immaculate Nusli Wadia of\nBombay Dyeing. \n\n \n\nNow, with the fall of Rajiv, the Chhabrias have sworn to avenge\ntheir defeat.\n\n\nThey have joined hands with Gurumurthy to try and persuade the new\ngovernment to intervene in the battle over Larsen & Toubro.\n\n\nTo reverse the takeover. \n\n \n\nWill V P Singh oblige? \n\n \n\nWill cabinet secretary Vinod Pande, asked by Singh to look into\nthe matter, act at the behest of Gurumurthy?\n\n\nOr will he keep a safe distance from the corporate war, having burnt\nhis fingers once - - during the Ambani versus Wadia war which led to the\ninfamous Fairfax scandal? \n\n \n\nWhat role will new finance secretary Bimal Jalan play?\n\n\nWhat is the opinion of Soli Sorabjee, attorney general?\n\n\nMost crucial, of course, will be the decision of the Supreme Court\nwhich is currently seized of the issue.\n\n\nOn an appeal against the Bombay high court, which cleared the\ntakeover. \n\n \n\nWhatever happens, it seems certain the Gurumurthy-Chhabria\ncombine will try to force the new government to intervene.\n\n\nBut can they prise the company out of the hands of the Ambanis?\n\n\nUnlikely, say the experts.\n\n\nIf the Ambanis lose Larsen & Toubro, by the same argument, the\nChhabrias themselves could lose Dunlop and Shaw Wallace, Dorr Oliver and\nMather & Platt.\n\n\nAt least two of them were equally controversial acquisitions. \n\n \n\nWhat would then happen to R P  takeovers?\n\n\nOr Vijay  .\n\n\nOr the many others that have taken place during the Rajiv regime?\n\n\nWhat would be the fall-out of such a decision? \n\n \n\nSailesh Kottary profiles the new corporate war threatening to\ngrab the headlines.  \n\n \n\nFor Dhirubhai Ambani and for several others close to the Rajiv\ngovernment, the gauntlet was thrown even before the new administration of\nV P Singh took its oath of office.\n\n\nThe chairman of the Reliance group, that pace-setting business house\nwhich had rapidly diversified during the  from a textile\ncompany to a petrochemical, cement and engineering colossus, had been\nperceived as the most favoured industrialist during the Rajiv years.\n\n\nAnd during the Indira Gandhi years as well.\n\n\nSo it was obvious that he would not exactly be in favour with the new\nbosses in New Delhi, who until last month were in the Opposition. \n\n \n\nTrue, Ambani, who shaped the destinies of Reliance from his\nfourth floor chambers which occupy half a floor of the highrise Maker\nChambers IV in  pricy Nariman Point district was not alone\nin feeling a sense of siege by the impending machinations of the changed\norder.\n\n\nIt was a miasma which hung over several extra-constitutional centres\nof power of New  age of Gucci and Cartier that had just been\nvoted out of office: Captain Satish Sharma, Lalit Suri, Amitabh Bachchan\namongst others. \n\n \n\nThe abrasive Captain Sharma whose career flight path had been\nclosely linked with that of Rajiv had hardly endeared himself to anyone\nduring the heady days of power.\n\n\nThose were the days when the high and mighty across the land came to\nhis office to receive their  diktat  .\n\n\nOne such visitor was industrialist Vijayapat Singhania, who was\nmade to cool his heels for a very long time until they were virtually frozen\nin the  ante-room, despite a confirmed appointment.\n\n\nFor his efforts, Singhania was told that his newspaper,  The\nIndian Post  , was a  'rag'  .\n\n\nAnd that it was an inconvenient one too.\n\n\nLalit Suri was more low-profile, but the  entrepreneur\n had managed to establish several businesses and owned a massive\n5-star hotel in the capital during the construction of which more rules were\nbroken than the hotel had rooms. \n\n \n\nAmitabh Bachchan was perhaps the one with the most acute\nsymptoms of the siege complex.\n\n\nIt was largely due to his  blatant enormity and\nvaulting ambitions - - coupled with his own status as a megastar - - that the\nBachchan had come to represent the most visible face of cronyism that\nflourished under Rajiv Gandhi.\n\n\nBrother  possession of a flat in Switzerland saw\nperhaps the most scandalous cover-up on the part of the Gandhi\nadministration, next only to the Bofors affair.\n\n\nCousin Abhijit  hand in the Gammon India takeover\ncontroversy saw the Bachchans scripting an indeterminate role as\nindustrialists for themselves - - with a little help from the financial\ninstitutions, of course. \n\n \n\nThe  action, though seemingly\nunconnected, was not long in coming Captain Sharma, however, has been the\nonly victim of a frontal attack when his house was raided and he scurried to\nlegal experts to seek advice on the possibility of obtaining\nanticipatory bail.\n\n\nThe Bachchan file has been reopened and last week the star gave a\ndetailed interview to a periodical from  The Times of India  group\nof publications in which he lashed out at the attempts being made by the\nadministration to harass, hound and humiliate him and his family.\n\n\nSo by last week, if it was clear that it was not to be a case of only\nVimal with V P Singh, it was equally clear that Ambani would nonetheless be\nchosen for special attention. \n\n \n\nThe omens of such a fate for the third largest business house\nwith a turnover exceeding Rs 2,300  crores  were visible in\nthe first executive actions of the new prime minister.\n\n\nVinod Pande, the former all-powerful revenue secretary who had led\nthe crackdown against erring industrialists with his chief bloodhound,\nBhure Lal, then head of the Directorate of Enforcement, were both called back\nfrom the boondocks.\n\n\nThe former was made the cabinet secretary and the latter inducted\ninto the prime  office as joint secretary. \n\n \n\nBhure Lal in particular had a special reason to dislike\nAmbani.\n\n\nHe had got the boot three years ago while on the trail of the shell\ncompanies in the Caribbean which had invested Rs 22  crores\n in  Reliance industries.\n\n\nWhile rumour had it that Ambani owned the clutch of shell companies\nwith such fanciful names as Crocodile Investments, Fiasco Investments etc,\nit was also speculated that the powers that be were purposely misled into\nbelieving that Bhure Lal was actually investigating the hoard of\nAmitabh Bachchan while overtly tracking the Ambanis. \n\n \n\nWhatever the truth, the fact is that V P Singh was soon shunted\nfrom the finance portfolio and Vinod Pande and Bhure Lal were relegated to\nminor roles once the seeds of suspicion had been firmly planted.\n\n\nAnd what was harvested was the Michael Hershman affair and the\nresultant Thakkar-Natarajan Commission which tried to ascertain the nature of\nBhure  endeavours. \n\n \n\nThe third key player to be recalled in the game plan now\nunfolding was Bimal Jalan, an Ambani antagonist, from the post of executive\ndirector of the International Monetary Fund in Washington who was inducted as\nfinance secretary.\n\n\nIn a curious switch of jobs, Gopi Arora, an alleged Ambani\nsympathiser, was sent to the IMF, to stay far from the scene of action and\nnot to be able to influence events, as it were.\n\n\nInterestingly, all three senior bureaucrats, Bimal Jalan, Vinod Pande\nand Bhure Lal, refused to comment on their current endeavours to the \nWeekly  . \n\n \n\nThere have been at least three other happenings which convince\n A-team that the group will be in for some form of\ninquisition in the coming weeks if not months.\n\n\nFirst, there was the transfer of K Vishwanathan, the collector of\ncustoms, Bombay, who had quashed a case against the  company,\nReliance Industries as he felt there was not enough evidence.\n\n\nThe charge was of the firm having imported extra spinning units\nfor its synthetic yarn mills, a charge which entails a fine totalling\nRs 120  crores  .\n\n\nSecondly, that case now stands reopened as of December 30, 1989.\n\n\nAnd, finally, there was the sacking of Premjit Singh, chairman of BoB\nFiscal Services, even though he had just a few months of his tenure left.\n\n\nBoB Fiscal Services was a subsidiary of the Bank of Baroda and had\nplayed a key role in the Ambani takeover of Larsen & Toubro. \n\n \n\nThe customs case against Reliance Industries is only a warning\nshot across  bow and he knows it.\n\n\nOne hundred and twenty  crores  of rupees can hardly\ntrip a juggernaut that earns profits of Rs 260  crores \nannually.\n\n\nBut he also knows that the  plans for\nretribution of sorts may include the breakup of his empire by prising\nout his prized acquisition, Larsen & Toubro.\n\n\nAnd ironically, that could perhaps be achieved in just the way the\nAmbanis acquired it, according to their detractors.\n\n\nBy using the leverage of the government-owned financial\ninstitutions such as the Unit Trust of India, the General Insurance\nCorporations and Life Insurance Corporations, all of whom own a sizeable\nstake in the company. \n\n \n\nIf that could come about, it will slash the Ambani empire by\nhalf.\n\n\nBut more frightening would be the grim consequences of government\naction on industry.\n\n\nSuch an interference will certainly be opening a  box which was only once earlier opened in 1983 when the financial\ninstitutions sacked nine directors of Escorts in a bid to help Swraj Paul\nwrest control from H P Nanda.\n\n\nNanda fought the case all the way to the Supreme Court and the\nfinancial institutions got a severe rap on the knuckles.  \n\n \n\nBy any standards, and for anyone, Larsen & Toubro is certainly a\nblue chip acquisition.\n\n\nFounded in 1946 by two enterprising Danish engineers, Henning\nHolck-Larsen and Soren Toubro, the company has established a formidable\nreputation in fields of manufacture as diverse as dairy machinery, heat\nexchangers and shielding for nuclear reactors.\n\n\nIt has also diversified successfully into cement manufacture and\ncivil construction.\n\n\nWith Holck-Larsen retiring in 1978, the reins of corporate power\npassed on to his protege, N M Desai. \n\n \n\nIn these days of takeover tycoons, L & T was a prime target since\nit had a small equity base of Rs 56  crores  , the financial\ninstitutions held 40 per cent of the equity and particularly since no one\ncontrolled more than 0.4 per cent of the stock.\n\n\nBesides, it was a profitable acquisition.\n\n\nIn 1987, it had earned a net profit after tax of Rs 28  crores\n on sales of Rs 528  crores  and its strength was in\nits team of professional engineers of diverse disciplines, the finest\nanywhere in the land. \n\n \n\nThe predatory moves began in mid-1987 when non-resident\nindustrialist Manu Chhabria, fresh from his successful but much delayed\nacquisition of Shaw Wallace began buying L & T shares - - a spree which he\nstopped once he had purchased about 1.5 per cent of stock.\n\n\nWith the financial institutions controlling under a half of the\n equity, obviously any corporate raider could only be\nsuccessful in his attempts to gain management control if the\ninstitutions were in his favour.\n\n\nBut by end-1987, the green light was not showing for Chhabria, even\nthough he presumably must have been assured of support from New Delhi\nbefore deciding to invest. \n\n \n\nAround this time, L & T was a house divided with its senior\nmanagement team riven with discord.\n\n\nSeveral senior executives had left the company due to serious\ndifferences with Desai.\n\n\nAnd matters came to a head with the exit of U V Rao, vice-president\nof the  most profitable division, the switchgear and\nelectronics group.\n\n\nRao quit because it was increasingly becoming clear to him that even\nthough he was senior, the candidate being groomed by Desai for the job of\npresident was S R Subramaniam, vice-president in charge of excavators,\nshipping and personnel. \n\n \n\nIndeed, the appointment of Subramaniam as president effective\nlast April was a benchmark in the  history as two other\nvice-presidents, apart from Rao, had been superseded.\n\n\nAnd according to his detractors, Desai was now packing his\nvice-presidential team with loyalists.\n\n\nFurther, the financial institutions too were more than a bit\nconcerned as Desai had not given a thought to succession planning even though\nhis term was to expire within a few months, in March 1989.\n\n\nThe unstated feeling was that Desai was scheming to wield power even\nafter retirement as he would become the   eminence grise \n while his loyalists squabbled among themselves.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ffdfbbd3-d375-4f55-81f3-7a86b17e4afd", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.054668+00:00"}

Dec. 3, 1994. \n\n\nDear Dr. Shastri, \n\n \n\nI met Prin. Bhogishayana again this morning and enquired if he  \ncould talk to Mr. Sushilkumar. \n\n\nHe told me that though he was  with him at two /  \nthree programmes, this time, because it is the election time, Sushilkumar was  \nalways so crowded with the political aspirants, that he could not get an  \nappointment to open this topic with him.  \n\n \n\nBhogishayana, however told me that he will write immediately to  \nMr. Sushilkumar on his Delhi address about your work. \n\n\nHe may also write to you and give you the letter of introduction to  \nMr. Shinde. \n\n\nHe also suggested that you might proceed with your plan, writing to  \nMr. Sushilkumar Shinde on his Delhi address - - Gen. Secretary, AICC,  \nJantar-Mantar Road New Delhi or personally seeing him in Delhi or Kop. or  \nanywhere giving reference to Prin.  having written to  \nhim in regard to your work, without waiting for his letter of introduction to  \nyou to Mr. Shinde. \n\n\nHe promised to immediately write  to Mr. Shinde and  \nexpressed confidence that your work will then be done promptly. \n\n\nMy good offices with Mr. Shinde may also come of some use to you.  \n \n\n \n\nFor my   ` Varshashraddha'  I am  \ncoming to Kop. from 16th Dec. to 20th Dec., at which, with  \ntelephoning you    previously   I will come to  \nsee you with the remaining part of Ch.1 on Communication-skill Model. \n\n\nBy second week of Jan. my Ch.2 on  ` cloze'  will be  \nready. \n\n\nAs per your proposed plan, you may have been leaving for Bombay on  \n10th for tape-recording Meeting. \n\n\nWish you success. \n\n\nConvey regards to Mrs. Shastri.  \n\n\nWith warm & personal regards, \n \n\n\nYours faithfully, sd/- \n\n  \n\n\n11-B, Suvidyanagar, Solapur - 413004 Dec. 12, 1994 \n\n\nDear Dr. Shastri, \n\n \n\nYou might have received two of my earlier letters. \n\n\nAs I have stated in my second letter, though Prin. Bhogishayana  \ncouldn't personally talk to  Shri  Shinde, during his visit  \nhence on the 2nd and 3rd, as promised by Prin.  \nBhogishayana, he has written to  Shri  Shinde about your work. \n\n\nYou may, therefore, as per his suggestion, proceed with your plan of  \neither writing to  Shri  Shinde or seeing him personally. \n\n\nI, however, am trying to get from him a letter of introduction to  \n Shri  Shinde as per our original idea. \n\n\nUnfortunately, as he ( i.e. Prin. Bhogishayana ) is always busy, I  \ncouldn't find him   ` at home'   .  \n\n \n\nLast Tuesday, my father, when he had gone out for his routine  \n ` walking'  , feeling giddy, fell down in the street, and  \nsince then is ailing rather seriously, requiring a lot of nursing, which none  \nbut I have to do. \n\n\nMy wife also is required to go to Pune, Kolhapur etc.  on domestic duties. \n\n\nAs such, I am unable to leave Solapur for the time being. \n\n\nI hope that I will be able to come to Kolhapur in the first week of  \nJan. \n\n\nTill then I will try to complete the remaining part of Ch. 1. (  \nCommunication Model ) and Ch. 2 on Cloze Procedure, though proper leisure - -  \nboth physically and mentally - - is not available. \n\n\nHowever, I am    determined   \n to complete the work in any case before May 1995 end. \n\n\nKindly therefore, understanding my present inability, bear with me. \n\n\nAn occasional time in reply will be quite soothing.

Dec. 26,  \n1994. \n\n\nDear Dr. Shastri, \n\n \n\nReceived your letter dated 19 . 12 on Friday, the 23rd. \n\n\nAccordingly on Saturday, I talked to prin. Bhogishayana and  \ncommunicated to him your request about his giving to you a letter of  \nintroduction to  Shri  Shinde. \n\n\nI also told him of your going to Delhi on the 6th and  \n7th of Jan. \n\n\nHis reaction was that he has already passed the information to  \n Shri  Shinde through his Solapur liason  Shri   \nVishnupant Kothe <*> the character ` K' is overwritten </*> and that by this  \ntime  Shri  Shinde might have done all that is needful. \n\n\nTherefore, he didn't see any need to give any letter of introduction. \n\n\nMoreover,  Shri  Shinde, there being busy election  \ndays, may not be available in Delhi at the time you go there. \n\n\nHis advice <*> ` c' in ` advice' is overwritten </*> is that you  \ndirectly see the Parliamentary Secretary and the work would be done.  \n\n \n\nHis advice is quite sound and he must have communicated the  \nmatter to  Shri  Shinde; but to add to it, if you really  \nhappen to meet  Shri  Shinde, you may make  use  \nof my letter also. \n\n\nI am sure, that if Shinde hears of my name, he will look into the  \nmatter. \n\n\nTherefore, uninvitedly, I have put alongwith this letter, my letter  \nto  Shri  Shinde about your work. \n\n\nIf it helps you, well and good. \n\n\nI, however, wish you success in  every endeavour of  \nyours.  \n\n \n\nKindly write to me after you return from Delhi. \n\n\nHope you have gone through the pages I left with you. \n\n\nMy father not well as yet; in fact worsened. \n\n\nHe is admitted to the hospital; but I hope, he will get on well,  \nsoon.  \n\n \n\nThe rest is all    alright   . \n\n\nWith regards to Mrs. Shastri and love to children,  \n \n\n\nYours faithfully, sd/- \n\n \n\n\n Wish you all happy  Makar Sankranti !   \n \n\n\n11-B, Suvidyanagar, Solapur - 413004. Jan. 14, 1995. \n\n\nDear Dr. Shastri, \n\n \n\nAs per your earlier letter ( dt. 19 . 12 .94 ) , you were to go  \nto Delhi on the 6th and 7th of this month. \n\n\nI hope, you did go and come back from there, the mission, successful ! \n\n\nDid you receive my letter, probably dated 27th Dec. 94,  \nconveying you Prin.  message and also accompanying my  \nown letter addressed to  Shri  Shinde. \n\n\nI am very doubtful, you could see Shinde, looking to the present  \npolitical unrest; but alongwith the OUP work ( ? ) you must also have got a  \nclearance from the Parliamentary Secretary for making use of the telecast  \ndeliberations in the parliament. \n\n\nIt must have been very cold in Delhi these days ! \n\n\nHow did you manage yourself before the same ? \n\n\nHow is your health now ?  \n\n \n\nMy father is a little better off now; he can move about. \n\n\nBut his sugar is pretty high; and with his present state of health,  \nit is difficult for me to move out. \n\n\nMy College Annual Prize distribution is there tomorrow. \n\n\nThat will free me of many of my encumbrances. \n\n\nBy the end of this month maximum by the end of the first week of Feb.  \nI will shed off all my teaching  responsibility. \n\n\nI have now completed the \" Communication Skill Approach  \n\" of the Chapter I \n\n\nI plan to come to Kop., in the first week of Feb., alongwith my  \nprogress report and Fee ! \n\n\nThere after, I will be fully available for the work. \n\n\nKindly write me back a line or two at your convenience. \n\n\nI am arranging ( trying - - without much certainty ) for getting  \nmyself re-employed in an unaided College - - which would take me possibly for  \nanother five years - - hence Ph.D. would be not much out of relevance ! \n\n\nMoreover, P.G. teaching also will continue for five more years. \n\n\nNothing is, however certain, and it never is. \n\n\nThe rest is Okay. \n\n\nHow about you & yours ?  \n\n\nMy regards to Mrs. Shastri & love to children. \n \n\n\nYours faithfully, sd/- \n\n \n\n\n11-B, Suvidyanagar, Solapur - 413 004. Feb. 2, 1996. \n\n\nDear Dr. Shastri, \n\n \n\nReceived the proforma you prepared for the  ` Release  \nForm'  along with your letter yesterday. \n\n\nI have fixed Monday, the 5th Feb. as a day for them to  \nwrite their essays. \n\n\nImperfections are bound to be there in the execution of the scheme. \n\n\nIt will be around the 10th of Feb. for me to send them to  \nyou.  \n\n \n\nI had been to Pune & Bombay from 27th to 31st  \nJan. and have returned from Bombay only yesterday morning after seeing off  \nMilind. \n\n\nIn two-three days, my daughter-in-law with my granddaughter will  \ncome here for about a  stay, the granddaughter keeping me  \nbusy for all that time. \n\n\nWe all plan to come to Kop. around 17th to 20th  \nFeb. to see all our relatives there.  \n\n \n\nI don't think Mrs. Upalani has given the right consideration to  \nthe equivalence  ratio formula. \n\n\nIt is not the regular correlation between two scales. \n\n\nWithin the same scale, with the large number, the ratio is bound to  \ngo high up. \n\n\nThe mischief is with the m/m-1 = 10/9. \n\n\nWith this factor the quotient is bound to go high. \n\n\nThere is nothing more in our data or calculation; probably the  \nformula is inapplicable. \n\n\nWe may drop the idea of applying it or may take it to some other  \nexpert \n\n\nThere is no relation between this and the  30 + 21   \ndivision of Com. students, because this computing of S.D. is for all 51  \nstudents. \n\n\nMoreover the results are stable for all the facilities. \n\n\n 30 + 21  division concerns only with M1,  \nM2, M3, M4 correlation, which is a minor matter  \ndone at EDP ( Tata ) . \n\n\nCloze M1 M2 M3 M4 correlation  \nhave been worked out at Shivaji Computer Centre for all 51. \n\n\nThe fact is that you have not really gone through the data and you  \npick up something seemingly wrong and get the thing blocked there.  \n\n \n\nThe  ` post-test'  was done on Sunday the  \n28th. \n\n\nThe calculations will be ready soon. \n\n\nThe error of ( 30 + 21 ) , if it is so ( pointed out now, after 9  \nyears ! ) is being corrected.  \n\n \n\nThe rest is fine. \n\n\n   Please   convey my regards to Mrs  \nShastri and blessings to  Sou.  Geetha & her children.  \n\n\nWith regards, \n \n\n\nYours faithfully, sd\\- \n\n \n \n\n\n11-B, Suvidyanagar, Solapur - 413004 Jan. 25, 1996. \n\n\nDear Dr. Shastri, \n\n \n\nAs per your instruction I have given the release forms to some  \nfifteen of my IAS ( Prelium ) students with an instruction that they should  \nprepare on any one of the following essay topics ( 1000 words ) \n\n\n1. Relevance of Gandhiji Today. \n\n\n2. Role of Opposition in Democracy \n\n\n3. Happy is the Nation Without a History. \n\n\n4. Future of English in India. \n\n\n5. Good bye to Planned Economy \n\n\n6. Drug Addiction. \n\n\nThey will also be asked to write a timed essay on : - ( 1000 words )  \n1. Does Religion Divide ? 2. Violence is Betrayal of Democracy. 3. Should  \nMothers Go out to Work ? 4. A Truly Successful Marriage is An Unattainable  \nIdeals. 5. Independence is a State of Mind. 6. Are We Progressing ? 7.  \nFreedom of Press 8. Value of Propaganda in Human Life 9. Impact of Science on  \nHuman Life. \n\n\nThey will write their essays in the frist week of Feb.  \n\n \n\nAlso I have put M1, M2, M3,  \nM4 - - the SSC Eng, Total, HSC. Eng. & Total scores of the Commerce  \n( 51 ) students together and given to my stastistics colleague for finding  \nout Mean, S.D., and corrections  \n\n \n\nSo also, I have prepared the passages ( 4) for the battery, as  \nwe contemplated and am going to give them to the Part-I students for a  \npost-test.  \n\n \n\nI am rewriting whatever part need, being rewritten.  \n\n \n\nKindly contact Mrs. Uplani and get her studied opinion on the  \n equivalence reliability and at earliest  \nconvenience let me know about the same. \n\n\nIf  necessary, we may refer the matter to Dr. Tharu  \ntoo.  \n\n \n\nI have corrected the proof of the remaining part of Ch.I & the  \nCh. III on Preparation on Administration of the Cloze Test.  \n\n\nHope you all are enjoying good health, \n\n\nWith regards to you and Mrs. Shastri, \n \n\n\nYours faithfully, sd/- \n\n  \n\n\n11-B Suvidyanagar, Solapur - 413 004 August 6, 1996. \n\n\nDear Dr. Shastri, \n\n \n\nOn Sunday the 21st July, as per your suggestion I  \nphoned you up around 3.30 p.m., hoping you to have returned from Sangli and  \nMiraj. \n\n\nAs the telephone only rang and nobody lifted it, I think, you had  \nnot come back. \n\n\nLater, as I got a message from Solapur of the sudden and unexpected  \ndeath of my dear friend and next door neighbour Prof. D.S. Dalal ( Phone No.  \n611079 ) under accident, I rushed to Solapur and couldn't phone you later.  \n \n\n \n\nI heartily congratulate you and Raju for the new home in Pune  \nand the car. \n\n\nPlease convey my sense of joy and congratulation to both the Mrs.  \nShastries ( Sr. & Jr. ) on this achievements. \n\n\nHow long is Raju in India ? \n\n\nWhen are they and you moving to the new home ? \n\n\nCan I have the postal address and descriptive location of the house ?  \n \n\n \n\nHow is your corpus project proceeding ? \n\n\nDoes your assistant keep on coming and helping you regularly ? \n\n\nHope you do not strain yourself too much.  \n\n \n\nDid the subject committee meet to decide the panel of referees ? \n\n\nI went through the thesis again and found it not too bad. \n\n\nI request you kindly to keep a paternal eye on the development in  \nregard to this thesis.  \n\n \n\nMilind is coming to Pune around 10  th  to  \n15th Aug., on his way to Tokyo and we all are gathering    in   Pune at that time to see him.  \n\n \n\nI am busy with the  ` Centre'  work as new  \nadmissions are to begin from Oct. 96. \n\n\nThe present batch continues.  \n\n \n\nKindly convey my regards to Mrs. Shastri and my best wishes to  \nRaju,  Sau.

{"text": "HARD TIMES IN KASHMIR  \n\n \n\nWHILE the Union Home Minister, Mufti\nMohammed Sayeed, was perfectly right to distinguish between probllems in\nPunjab and Jammu and Kashmir, his assurance that the Government  \"\nwill be tough with the terrorists\"  can hardly be said to be\nparticularly enlightening.\n\n\nWith secessionist violence in the Kashmir valley worse than ever,\nand disturbing reports of an exodus of minority community people from the\nregion, the nation is justified in demanding decisive action from the Centre.\n\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the onus of maintaining law and order in a\nsensitive State should have been on the State Government.\n\n\nHowever, Dr Farooq  self-evident alienation from\nhis own people, and the total breakdown of the administration rule out such a\npossibility.\n\n\nFor all the  indignation at, the   \" week-kneed\"  policy towards the militants, and the\nChief  own claim that New Delhi conceded too much over\nthe Rubaiya Sayeed incident, it is clear now that there is little scope for\nimprovement so long as Dr Abdullah is in power.\n\n\nNot only are his  credentials under a cloud,\nbut its willingness and ability to cope with insurgency are also suspect.\n\n\n \n\nIn fact, there may be reason to believe that aided and abetted by\nMr Rajiv Gandhi, the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir is looking for\nan opportunity to score political points against the new National Front\nregime in Delhi.\n\n\nThere is a naive belief that if the situation in the valley is\nallowed to deteriorate even further, it will have an adverse effect on the\nUnion  standing, and lend substance to the Opposition\n charge that Mr V. P. Singh is compromising \nunity and integrity.\n\n\nMoreover, the Congress(I) is confident that failure in Kashmir will\nencourage hardliners within the Janata Dal to flex their muscles, and that\nthe effect of such a development would be to mar prospects for the\nreconciliation process in Punjab.\n\n\nAt the same tiem, the Congress(I) may hope to play on the  dissatisfaction with the  reluctance to dismiss Dr\nAbdullah and impose  Rule in the State.\n\n\nWhat is puzzling, however, is that the Centre should have fallen into\nthis trap, for it is specious to argue that dismissal of the National\nConference Government in Srinagar would enable Dr Abdullah to regain\npublic sympathy.\n\n\nThe ugly mood in the valley rules out that possibility. \n\n \n\nThanks to the mishandling of the situation, the \npopulist rhetoric has again moved from being anti-Centre to anti-Indian,\nand the secessionists and terrorists have completely eclipsed  mainstream opposition.\n\n\nIt is unlikely that the forces that have been unleashed can be\neradicated within a year, even if  Rule is imposed.\n\n\nUnder the circumstances, the logic of the Home \ndecision to allow the problem to fester seems inexplicable.\n\n\nTrue, there is the challenge of the Congress ( I) version of the\nkidnapping incident, but Mr V. P. Singh should have nothing to fear unless it\nis proved that he or his aides wilfully compromised national interests and\nsecurity.\n\n\nHowever, this is not to suggest that the Mufti may not have\nindulged in some game of manipulation in his home State.\n\n\nThe way Mr Buta Singh earlier mishandled the Punjab problem was a\npointer to the dangers of allowing  \" exiled\"  politicians\nto have a finger in the affairs of troubled regions.\n\n\nWhereas Mr Sayeed may be the right man for the  \" healing\ntouch\"  in Punjab, he may lack the necessary detachment to be able to\nrepeat the process in Kashmir.\n\n\nCertain draconian measures have become overdue if secessionism is\nto be eliminated from the valley, and these call for resilience to be able to\nwithstand adverse public opinion.\n\n\nConsequently, only a politician with a constituency that is far\nbigger than Kashmir can measure up to the job.\n\n\nSentimentalism should not be allowed to override the need for\ncounter-insurgency measures.  \n\n\n  MENEM MISSES THE MARK  \n\n \n\nARGENTINA is a country where economists\nfear to tread.\n\n\nSince last  election of the President, Mr Carlos\nMenem,  basket case economy has gone from bad to worse to\nchaotic, and the chaos is nowhere more prevalent than in the highest offices\nof the Government.\n\n\nMr Menem came to power on the crest of widespread popularity with an\nelectorate that ignored his past background of free-spending populism and\nlistened instead to his promises of better times.\n\n\nIn the beginning he assembled a Cabinet that looked ready to tackle\nthe  hyperinflation and massive foreign debt in a\nnononsense manner.\n\n\nHowever, Mr Menem has since shown that economic reform for him means\nfiscal prestidigitation rather than politically damaging but needed policies\nlike paring the bloated public sector, trimming the government deficit,\nand deregulating the  economy. \n\n \n\nMr Menem has sought instead to try to solve  inflation - - prices rose by 50 per cent in December alone - - through a\nsimplistic method of reducing the amount of money in circulation.\n\n\nHis attempts to stop issuing new currency notes and to force\nArgentinians to exchange their funds for long-term government bonds instead\nof interest-bearing certificates and dollars - - the two methods by which\nArgentinians have survived the constant devaluation of their currency - -\nhave come a cropper.\n\n\nThe only result has been a further downward slide for the Argentinian\naustral, which lost two-thirds of its value against the dollar in a month,\nmore inflation, and the exhaustion of whatever goodwill his countrymen held\nfor their new President.\n\n\nThe one thing Mr Menem has mastered, besides avoiding hard decisions,\nis the creation of emergency economic programmes that last an average\nof a week apiece.\n\n\nThis was the technique of Mr Raul Alfonsin, his predecessor; Mr Menem\nseems set to follow him into political oblivion.  \n\n\n  SARKARIA ON DELHI  \n\n \n\nIT was widely expected that the Sarkaria\nCommitte, which examined the question of reorganization of  administrative set-up and whose report was tabled in Parliament last\nweek, would recommend something short of Statehood for the sprawling\nmetropolis.\n\n\nFor though it was an anomaly that the capital should so far have\nbeen denied the true substance of representative government even while it was\nendowed with an elected metropolitan council and other democratic trappings,\nit would have been even more anomalous to vest it with full Statehood when it\nhappens to be the national capital and seat of the Union Government.\n\n\nThe Sarkaria Committee has, therefore, wisely ruled out Statehood,\nnoting quite simply that if Delhi is made a full-fledged State, there will be\na constitutional division of sovereignty and functions between the\nGovernment at the Centre and that in the national capital, and that such a\nstatus would not  \" suit\"  Delhi.\n\n\nIt has, however, recommended a proper Legislative Assembly and a\nCabinet system of government in place of the present executive council.\n\n\nThe very sensible via media suggested by the committee should not be\nunwelcome even to the BJP which spearheaded the demand for full Statehood.\n\n\n \n\nThe  control over the national capital would,\nunder the recommendations, extend only to matters relating to law and\norder, police and land, and the development of the metropolis in line with\nits requirements would truly be the charge of the Government under the new\nsystem, when it gets to be finally accepted.\n\n\nThere is, at present, some muted protest over the fact that the  recommendations do not go far enough, but once it is\nrealized that these will only take away much vexatious burden from the\nMetropolitan Government, leaving it free to concentrate earnestly on\ndevelopment tasks, that protest should disappear.\n\n\nFew will deny that the  recommendations do\nmeet the democratic aspirations of Delhi to the fullest extent, subject,\nto be sure, to qualifications that are inevitable because of the reality of\nDelhi being the national capital.\n\n\nAt any rate, the Centre would exercise the powers reserved for it\nonly with the tacit approval of the  elected government and\nby no means in a unilateral, or high-handed, manner as has been the case so\nfar.\n\n\n basic problem has been its multiplicity of\nauthorities, with virtually none of them under effective control.\n\n\nThat astonishing situation should end, once a fully representative\nand duly elected government, as envisaged by the Sarkaria Committee,\ntakes charge.  \n\n \n\n\n  THE BALT BRIGADE  \n\n \n\nTHERE is cold comfort in the thought that\n is not the only federation under attack.\n\n\nIn fact, it may not be too much to say that the present crisis\nbetween Moscow and the rebellious Baltic republic of Lithuania could well\ndecide the fate of perestroika as well as of the Soviet President, Mr Mikhail\nGorbachov.\n\n\nLithuanian secessionist fervour has been simmering for some time,\nand the liberation of Eastern Europe has brought it to a boil.\n\n\nMr Gorbachov has indicated that he is not unopposed to autonomy for\nthe Baltic states so long as their freedom does not hinder his perestroika\nprogramme for the Soviet Union as a whole.\n\n\nThis, in essence, means giving him time and doing nothing to\nundermine his position.\n\n\nBut through their unilateral declaration of independence last\nmonth the Lithuanians, led by their President, Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, a\nmusic teacher with a liking for dramatic movements but with no flair for\npolitics, refused to give Mr Gorbachov the benefit of either.\n\n\nMany analysts feel that Mr Gorbachov would have been willing to grant\nthe Lithuanians the substance of independence if they had forgone the\nsymbols for the time being and kept a lid on the rhetoric, which is what the\nmore sober Estonians are doing. \n\n \n\nIt is noteworthy that the Western nations have been subdued in\ntheir support for the Lithuanian cause, if not outright disparaging.\n\n\nHowever, the present crisis could not have come at a worse time\nfor Mr Gorbachov.\n\n\nWith the introduction of the presidential system the Communist\nParty is in the last stages of disintegration, its various factions\njostling for power.\n\n\nIn the midst of all this, the Soviet President is trying to maintain\nhis position and hold to the centre ground.\n\n\nAllowing Lithuania to break away would almost surely lead to a chain\nreaction of secessionism around the Russian periphery which would cost Mr\nGorbachov dear among radicals, conservatives and moderates.\n\n\nOne voice that is suddenly heard more often is the powerful Soviet\nmilitary which tolerated the loss of Eastern Europe but refuses to\ncountenance the surrender of what it considers to be an integral part of\nthe country.\n\n\nMr Gorbachov is well aware of the role the military played in the\noverthrow of Khrushchev and Beria; his position is further weakened by the\nfact that he is on the verge of introducing radical eeconomic laws that will\ntake the Soviet Union directly into the realm of the free market. \n\n \n\nThe Lithuanian declaration is also troubling because of its\noutright rejection of the constitutional process that the Soviet leader has\ntaken such great pains to introduce.\n\n\nThe constitution is the political heart of the new Soviet Union that\nMr Gorbachov wants to create.\n\n\nHe cannot take a challenge to it lightly, no matter what his own\npolitical condition.\n\n\nMr Gorbachov is unlikely to use military force for fear it will\ndestroy all the international goodwill he has so carefully generated, but\nthe possibility of him going so far as to dismiss the Lithuanian parliament\ncannot be ruled out.\n\n\nWhile such strong-arm tactics are designed to show the Lithuanians\nthe impossibility of their cause - - the adversaries are so mismatched\nthat comparing the Balts to Lord  Light Brigade would not\nbe too farfeteched - - he is clearly in search of a facesaving compromise.\n\n\nThe hasty passage of a Bill on the right to secede was aimed at\nLithuanian sensibilities.\n\n\nFor the Soviet leader, however, the issue at stake is not only\nLithuania, the issue is the survival of perestroika - - just as the\nKashmir controversy here embodies the future of secularism - - which is\nwhy he cannot allow himself to lose.  \n\n\n  OPTIONS ON OIL  \n\n \n\nTHE Prime  recent\nstatement in the  Rajya Sabha  hinting at the possibility of\npetrol rationing confirms that Mr  decision to\nlevy-sizable imposts on imports of crude and petroleum products was\ninspired by the aim of reducing demand rather than raising revenue.\n\n\nIn fact, the Economic Survey for 1989-90 carried a broad hint of\nthe  thinking on the subject when it laid special\nemphasis on the conservation of crude-related energy sources, warning that\n \" the use of energy per unit of output continues to be high,\njudged by international standards\"  , and pointedly adding that\n \" the growth in the demand for energy needs to be contained\nspecially in the context of ( the) rise in prices\"  .\n\n\nWhat the survey did not state sufficiently firmly is that the\nworsening balance of payments crisis left the authorities with little\nchoice but to take decisive action to cut down on consumption.\n\n\nMr V. P. Singh referred to this when he told the  Rajya Sabha\n that the current  oil imports would cost around\n Rs  8,000  crores  compared to an estimated\nRs 6,400  crores  for 1989-90 and an actual Rs 4,300\n crores  in 1988-89.\n\n\nWhat passes understanding is why corrective action was not taken\nearlier, say in the middle of 1989-90, when the trend must already\nhave become clear.\n\n\nIndeed, the survey itself points to the fact that during\nApril-December of the year consumption of  \" petroleum oil and\nlubricants\"  had attained a growth rate of 7.8 per cent against\nthe 7.2 per cent increase in 1988-89, and average rise of 6.5 per cent during\nthe first four years of the Seventh Plan. \n\n \n\nBut it would be incorrect to say that no steps at all were taken\nduring 1989-90 to conserve the use of energy.\n\n\nWhat seems more accurate is that the measures taken were just not\neffective enough.\n\n\nThis is the challenge that the Government faces: it will not only\nhave to develop efficient production systems but also have them accepted\nat the grassroots level.\n\n\nAs the survey indicates, a lot of work has already been done in\nthis direction without, however, producing satisfactory results.\n\n\nThe reasons for this failure will have to be established and\nremoved, which can turn out to be a much harder task than merely imposing\npetrol rationing.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3c5946e3-6940-4696-9136-0a36753a313f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.057230+00:00"}

N. Krishnan ( a  Thiagaraja kriti\n on the violin); Sulochana Brahaspati (  dhrupad  in\n raga Shankara  ) ; C. R. Vyas (  khayal  in\n Dhani  ) ; Amjad Ali Khan (  alaap  and\n gat  in  Pilu  on the  sarod  )\n; Naina Devi (  thumri  in  Mishra Gara  ) ;\nDebu Chaudhuri (  alaap  in  Jhinjhoti  on the\n sitar  ) ; Shafaat Ahmed Khan (  teen-taal  in\n tabla  solo); Sheila Dhar (  khayal  in\n Shahana  ) ; Singh  Bandhu  Tejpal Singh and\nSurinder Singh (  khayal  in  Bhinna Shadja  )\nand Sumati Mutatkar ( Kabir  bhajan  in  Maand  ) .\n\n\nThe concert concluded late in the evening with the vocal\nrecitals of Savita Devi and Lakshman Bhatt Tailang, Allauddin   esraj  and Ustad Asad Ali   veena\n recital.\n\n\nMany of the artistes were at their best, some of the distinguished\namong them leaving many in the audience with a feeling of inadequacy in\nhtat they would have liked more from them.\n\n\nSuch was their form and excellence.\n\n\nThe vocalists were particular in choosing compositions which was\nappropriate to the occassion. \n\n \n\nDr. Mutatkar instantly created an aura of solemnity as she began\nwith   Omkar Vandana   before rendering the Kabir\n bhajan  in  raga Maand  , both presented with\ngreat feeling. \n\n \n\n leading accompanists made a rich contribution to\nthe success of the function.\n\n\nAmong them; Pandit Gopaldas on the  pakhawaj  ;\nUstads Ramzan Khan and Dayam Ali Qadri on the  tabla  ; Pandit\nInder Lal on the  sarangi  and Mahmud Dholpuri on the\nharmonium. \n\n \n\n  LISTENING   to the vocal\nrecitals in the second half of the  Sahitya Kala \nYuva Mahotsava  last week, I felt that those who get an opportunity\n to participate in such festivals must make up their\nminds whether they want to be performing artistes.\n\n\nThey are beginners at the moment - - with all that this implies.\n\n\nIt is not enough, even if it is desirable, to obtain a high academic\ndegree.\n\n\nAnd, although it is true that artistes, in the real sense, are born,\nthey are not made, yet it must be impressed upon intending young\nperformers that there are certain basic requirements which they have to\nfulfil if they wish to perform at formal concerts.\n\n\nAmong these are a good, appealing voice, confidence, which comes from\nvigorous   \" tayyari\"   , precision in\n swara  , aesthetics, including mannerism or  mudra\n , a good sense of proportion as to the duration of each number,\nstamina, etc.\n\n\nThey should have enough to give to make it worthwhile for the\nconcert goer. \n\n \n\nOutstanding among the young vocalists was Neeta Mathur whose\n khayals  in Kalawati were well rendered.\n\n\nEndowed with a good voice, her tunefulness at every stage of the\n   delineation in the slow  khayal\n was commendable.\n\n\nA pupil of wellknown vocalist Krishna Bisht, Neeta presented some\ngood  taans  as well, though in this she need greater\nefficiency.\n\n\nThe Mira  bhajan  was pleasing. \n\n \n\nMaking all allowance for age, the early stage of her career,\netc., Sarita  exposition of  Puriya Kalyan \nand  Bahar  was impressive.\n\n\nShe sang with confidence, notwithstanding the occasional shaking in\nher voice as she reached the upper octave.\n\n\nHer  taan  patterns have the impress of her\npreceptor, Mrs Sulochana Brahaspati, but I would wish her to avoid the\ndegree of vigour in  taans  , which suits the male singer more\nthan the female voice.\n\n\nAnd, when an artiste has already made a good impression within a\ncertain range it becomes redundant for her - - or him - - to attempt the\nfarends of the third octave.\n\n\nSarita was a bit unsteady there in an otherwise pleasing recital.\n\n\n \n\nPererna   khayals  in \nPuriya Dhanashri  reflected style of her mentors, Singh    Bandhu   Tejpal Singh and Surinder Singh.\n\n\nIt was reposeful, it was systematic.\n\n\nThere were a number of good  sargam taans  but gteater\nsteadiness and precision in  swara  were required as she\nprogressed into the upper octave.\n\n\nIf she had judiciously curtailed the embellishments in her \nkhayals  in the opening number, she would have had more time for the\nwell rendered composition in  Hamsadhwani  .\n\n\nShe should gain confidence with the passage of time.  \n\n \n\n\n  Narayanaswamy in top form   <*> line from left\nto right </*>\n\n\n  Carnatic music  / R.

V. Narayanswamy and B. Rajam Iyer - - both of them sexagenarians.\n\n\nThe latter is said to be the senior disciple but his performance was\nnowhere near the great music heard in the concerts of the former.\n\n\nAccording to many in the audience K. V. Narayanaswamy was in a top\nform not come across in his visit to Delhi in recent years.\n\n\nEven when not at his best KVN is known for his high sensitiveness and\nrefined aesthetic approach to music.\n\n\nThe  Atatala Varnam  in  Sankarabharanam\n and the other  Swathi Tirunal  compositions ( \nParipalaya, Saroruhasana  ) seemed to achieve a new high status in\nhis hands.\n\n\nMicro-tonal purity of a very high order was maintained throughout.\n\n\nOn the other hand, B. Rajam Iyer sounded raw both in sound and\nknowledge.\n\n\nCredit is, of course, due for his rendition of the beautiful songs\nlike   Sri Sundararajam  in \npantuvarali  and   Srikumara ( Atana)  .\n\n\nHe could somehow hit at  Tara shadja  correctly\neverytime but the inadequacies in other nuances were too many, his \nnishadam  in  Keeravani  for instance.\n\n\nStudents and listeners of music in Delhi are used to a very high\nstandard in pallavis and Rajam  pedestrian Pallavi, even in\nwhich he stumbled while negotiating  tisram  , was bland and\ndragging.\n\n\nLike all other aging musicians with sagging vocal chords he resorted\nto unwarranted speeches in between and tried to gain sympathy of the\nlisteners.\n\n\n Swaralaya  could have used the good forum for\npresenting a more deserving youngster. \n\n \n\n  Mridangam  accompaniment\nwas superb.\n\n\nOnly a maestro like him could have so effectively heightened the\naesthetic appeal of  music.\n\n\nNagarajan collaborated admirably on the  Kanjira  .\n\n\n \n\nOne of the most purposeful and appealing classical music\nprogramme of recent times was telecast last Sunday night.\n\n\nIt was on the eve of saint  birth-day and \nghanaraga pancharatna kritis  were presented with a difference, sans\nthe usual chaos and clashes of versions heard at Tiruvaiyaru and other\nfestivals.\n\n\nThe instrumentalists playing the  swarams  and the\nvocalists singling the  sahityam  was a welcome novelty.\n\n\nThe  Varali  piece never sounded so musical.\n\n\nLuck of synchronisation between the audio and vedio versions was too\nobvious in certain places like Dudukugala.\n\n\nIn sum, it was an excellent programme for producing which Subbudu,\nthe verteran penman of versatile capabilities, deserves kudos.  \n\n \n\n\n   profound  khayalas  in\n Poorva    <*> line from left to right </*>\n\n\n  Concerts  / R.

{"text": "SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS OF GLOTTAL DYNAMICS AND  CONTROL OF VOICING AND ASPIRATION IN HINDI STOPS  \n  \n\n\n ABSTRACT \n\n \n\nUsing transillumination technique, spatiotemporal patterns of\nglottal dynamics were investigated during voiced/unvoiced and\naspirated/unaspirated Hindi stops which were produced in isolated nonsense\nwords of the form \" CVCVC \" .\n\n\nResults show that spatial extent as well as timing of glottal gesture\nin relation to certain supraglottal articulatory events, such as the\narticulatory contact and articulatory release, differ in different types of\nstops.\n\n\nThe present paper discusses the role of these differences along with\ncertain glottal and extraglottal mechanisms in control of voicing and\naspiration in Hindi stops.  \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nHow voicing and aspiration associated with certain speech sounds\nare controlled has been a subject of considerable interest for over two and a\nhalf millennia.\n\n\nIt appears from the phonetic observations of ancient Indian\nphoneticians and grammarians that they recognized the larynx, to be specific\nthe glottis, as the source of phonation, i.e., voice, breathy voice,\naspiration, etc.\n\n\nThey observed that when the glottis was open, breath was produced;\nwhen it was closed, voice was produced; and when it was half-open, both\nbreath and voice were produced.\n\n\nFurther, breath was discharged for unvoiced consonants; voice was\ndischarged for voiced consonants and vowels; and both breath and voice were\ndischarged for voiced aspirates and voiced glottal fricative.\n\n\nAlso, more breath was discharged for aspirates than inaspirates. (\nSee Allen 1953 for further details.) \n\n \n\nThese above observations clearly indicate that voicing and\naspiration are essentially glottoaerodynamic phenomena in that they are\ngenerated at the glottis if the glottis is suitably adjusted and adequate\ntransglottal airflow is present.\n\n\nTransglottal airflow during speech sounds is jointly controlled by\nthe dynamic adjustments of the glottis and the supraglottal articulatory\nstructures, such as, the lips, the tongue, the soft palate, etc.\n\n\nFor generating adequate transglottal airflow to produce voicing\nand/or aspiration associated with various categories of stop consonants, the\nadjustments of the glottis and the articulators must be spatiotemporally\ncoordinated.\n\n\nThat is, when and how far the glottis should be allowed to open and\nwhen should it   close and achieve an\nadducted position in relation to certain articulatory events, such as,\narticulatory contact and articulatory release. \n\n \n\nUntil recently, observation of glottal adjustments has, however,\nbeen mostly speculative and inferential, based primarily on kinesthetic\nintrospection of the observers.\n\n\nOnly in the last two and a half decades or so, attention has been\ndirected toward collection of instrumental data on speech related glottal\nadjustments.\n\n\nThis came about with the introduction of cinefluorographic,\nphoto-electric glottographic, fiberscopic, and transillumination techniques\nin speech research.\n\n\nUsing these techniques considerable instrumental data have been\nacquired and reported on glottal adjustments associated particularly with the\nproduction of different categories of homorganic stop consonants from a\nnumber of two-category ( Cantonese, Danish, Dutch, English, French,\nIcelandic, Japanese, Mandarin, and Swedish ) , three-category ( Fukienese,\nKorean, and Tibetan ) , and four-category ( Hindi and Maithili ) languages.\n\n\n \n\nPreviously, we had reported glottographic data only on bilabial\nstops and glottal fricative of Hindi ( Dixit and MacNeilage 1974; Dixit\n1989).\n\n\nThis study provides glottographic data, obtained by transillumination\ntechnique, on all stops of Hindi.\n\n\nOne purpose of this study is to examine spatiotemporal relationship\nbetween dynamic adjustments of the glottis and certain articulatory events,\nsuch as articulatory contact and articulatory release, in stop consonant\nproduction in light of the data reported in this study and the studies on the\ncited languages.\n\n\nAnother purpose is to discuss general mechanisms used in the control\nof voicing/devoicing and aspiration associated with various homorganic stop\nconsonants.  \n\n\n METHOD \n\n \n\nA normal native speaker of standard Hindi from Nagla Bariar in\nMainpuri district of Uttar Pradesh served as subject.\n\n\nHe produced disyllabic nonsense test words of the form \"\nCVCVC \" in isolation.\n\n\nIn these words V was the high front unrounded vowel / i/ and\n\" C \" was one of the following stop consonants:  \n\n \n\nAll \" C \" positions in an individual word were\noccupied by the same stop.\n\n\nThe vowel in the second syllable was stressed.\n\n\nAll unvoiced stops were produced without glottal pulsing ( except for\na few initial glottal pulses in postvocalic stops), all voiced stops were\nproduced with glottal pulsing throughout their entire duration,  and all word-final stops were released. \n\n \n\nDuring the production of the test words, the glottis of the\nsubject was filmed at a film speed of 60 frames per second using a 16 mm\ncinecamera ( Olympus MC-R58 ) and a flexible fiberscope ( Olympus VF-0 ) .\n\n\nThe fiberscope was inserted through the nose and held in position by\na headband just behind the tip of the epiglottis.\n\n\nThe light from the fiberscope passing through the glottis was also\nsensed by a phototransistor attached to the skin of the neck just below the\narch of the cricoid cartilage.\n\n\nIt was held in that position by a neckband.\n\n\nThe audio signal was picked up by an oral microphone.\n\n\nSimultaneously with fiberscopic filming of the glottis, the\ntransillumination and audio signals together with synchronization time marks\nwere recorded on a magnetic tape.\n\n\nThe transillumination and audio signals and synchronization time\nmarks were later reproduced on paper for visual inspection using a visicorder\noscillograph ( Honeywell 1508 A ) . \n\n \n\nA caveat seems in order here: None of the above two methods of\nglottal observation, i.e., fiberscopic filming and transillumination, can be\ncalibrated at present, hence it would be imprudent to suppose that there is\none-to-one correspondence between the size ( extent) of the glottograms and\nthe actual size of glottal opening.\n\n\nThe size of the glottograms may be enhanced or diminished by the\nmovement of the tongue, the epiglottis and the larynx.\n\n\nFor example, if the tongue and/or the epiglottis move backward, or\nthe larynx moves downward, then the size of the glottograms would be\ndiminished.\n\n\nThus, the glottograms, generally, do not represent the actual size of\nglottal opening; nevertheless, they are quite useful in comparing the\nrelative size of glottal opening for different categories of stops and other\nconsonants. \n\n \n\nHowever, the glottograms reveal the temporal course of glottal\ndynamics ( i.e., opening-closing gesture of the glottis) with respect to\ncertain articulatory events, such as articulatory contact and articulatory\nrelease, quite realistically.\n\n\nSince the temporal patterns of glottal opening and closing gestures\nobtained by fiberscopic filming and transillumination technique were\nvirtually identical, therefore, only transillumination data are presented and\ndiscussed in this paper.  \n\n\n  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n\n \n\nThe transillumination data on Hindi stops are presented in Figure\n1 through 4.\n\n\nEach of the four figures consists of four graphs, each of which\ncontains two oscillographic traces.\n\n\nThe top trace ( GA ) represents the area of glottal opening, the\nbottom trace ( AE ) the audio envelope.\n\n\nThe GA trace at its lowest level indicates no light passing through\nthe glottis ( i.e., an adducted or closed glottis ) .\n\n\nUpward deviation from its lowest level indicates light passing\nthrough the glottis ( that is, an abducted or open glottis ) .\n\n\nSolid and broken vertical lines in the graphs mark the instants of\narticulatory contact and articulatory release, respectively.\n\n\nSince the test words were produced in isolation, the instants of\narticulatory contact for various  word-initial stops\ncannot be determined by the GA and AE curves; hence, they have been left\nunmarked in the graphs.\n\n\nA few instants of articulatory release were undisernible; they have\nbeen left unmarked in the graphs, too.\n\n\nThe zero under the first solid line marks the line-up point. \n\n\n  Spatiotemporal Patterns of Glottal Dynamics  \n\n \n\n  Unvoiced Unaspirated Stops   .\n\n\nFigure 1 presents the spatiotemporal patterns of glottal dynamics for\nthe unvoiced unaspirtated stops.    \n\n \n\nIn this figure, in the words / pipip/, / titit/ and / titit/ <*>\ndot blow the three \" ts \" </*> , the glottis begins to close\nrapidly from a respiratory open position and reaches a closed position\nimmediately after the articulatory release of the initial stops.\n\n\nHowever, in the word / kikik/, the glottis shows an opening-closing\ngesture for the initial stop, which is similar to that generally observed for\nthe medial ( intervocalic ) stops.\n\n\nClearly, all the initial stops in these words were produced with an\nopen glottis, through the degree of glottal opening varied from one stop to\nanother.\n\n\nThese results are similar to those reported in the other Hindi\nstudies ( Dixit and MacNeilage 1974; Dixit 1975; Kagaya and Hirose 1975;\nBenguerel and Bhatia 1980; Dixit 1989 ) and the studies on Dutch ( Yoshioka\net al. 1982 ) , French ( Benguerel et al. 1978 ) , Japanese ( Sawashima 1968\na, b; Sawashima and Miyazaki 1973; Sawashima and Niimi 1974; Niimi and\nSawashima 1974; Sawashima et al. 1975 ) , Korean ( Kim 1967, 1970; Kagaya\n1971, 1974; Hirose et al. 1974) and Maithili ( Yadav 1984 ) .\n\n\nThe initial unvoiced unaspirated stops in all the above studies, like\nthe present study, were produced with an open and non-vibrating glottis.\n\n\nHowever, the spatiotemporal patterns of glottal dynamics differed in\nthese studies depending on whether the unvoiced unaspirated stops occurred in\nthe absolute or non-absolute initial position in the test words and/or test\nsentences.\n\n\nOn the other hand, in Cantonese ( Iwata et al. 1981 ) , Fukienese (\nIwata et al. 1979 ) , Mandarin ( Iwata and Hirose 1976 ) and Tibetan (\nKjellin 1977 ) , the syllable- or word-initial unvoiced unaspirated stops\nwere produced with a virtually closed glottis, but without glottal pulsing.\n\n\n \n\nFor the medial ( intervocalic ) unvoiced unaspirated stop in the\nword / pipip/, the glottis is completely closed; in the word / titit/, it is\nvirtually closed; and in the word / titit/ <*> dots below the three ts in the\nword </*> , it is only slightly open.\n\n\nOnly in the word / kikik/, the glottis shows a clear opening-closing\ngesture for the medial stop, which begins at the articulatory contact and\nterminates somewhat after the articulatory release, but the size of glottal\nopening is very small.\n\n\nExcept for the datum on medial / k/, the data on other medial\nunvoiced unaspirated stops, examined in this study, are inconsistent with\nthose reported by Kagaya and Hirose ( 1975 ) and Benguerel and Bhatia ( 1980 )\n from Hindi.\n\n\nThey are also inconsistent with the data reported from Dutch ( Slis\nand Damste 1967 ) , English ( Lisker et al. 1969, 1970; Sawashima et al. 1970 )\n, French ( Benguerel et.al. 1978 ) .\n\n\nJapanese ( Sawashima 1968 a, b; Sawashima and Miyazaki 1973;\nSawashima and Niimi 1974; Niimi and Sawashima 1974 ) , Maithili ( Yadav 1984 )\nand Swedish ( Lindqvist 1972 ) .\n\n\nThe medial unvoiced unaspirated stops in the above studies were\ngenerally produced with an open and silent glottis.\n\n\nThe size of glottal opening varied from language to language.\n\n\nHowever, there were a number of occurrences of these stops in Dutch (\nSlis and Damste 1967 ) , English ( Lisker et al. 1969, 1970; Sawashima 1970 )\n, and Japanese ( Sawashima 1968 a, b; Sawashima and Miyazaki 1973 ) where the\nglottis was found to be closed.\n\n\nMoreover, a few occurrences of these stops in English showed no\ncessation of glottal pulsing ( Lisker et al. 1969, 1970; Sawashima 1970 ) .\n\n\n \n\nThe spatiotemporal patterns of glottal dynamics for the final\nunvoiced unaspirated stops in the words / pipip/, / titit/ <*> three dots\nbelow each of the ts </*> and / kikik/ show some semblance to the\nopening-closing gesture of the glottis with only a slight glottal opening.\n\n\nOn the other hand, for the final stop in the word / titit/, the\nglottis starts opening at the articlatory contact and continues to open\ntowards a respiratory open position.\n\n\nApart from the datum on the final / t/ in the word / titit/, the data\non the other final unvoiced unaspirated stops of this study do not compare\nwell with the data reported on similar stops from another Hindi study (\nBenguerel and Bhatia 1980 ) , and from English ( Lisker et al. 1969, 1970;\nSawashima 1970; Sawashima et al. 1970 ) , Korean ( Sawashima and Park 1979;\nSawashima et al. 1980 ) , Maithili ( Yadav 1984), and Swedish ( Lindqvist\n1972 ) studies.\n\n\nAs compared to the negligible glottal opening observed for the\nunvoiced unaspirated word-final stops in the present study, in the cited\nstudies a relatively larger glottal opening was observed during these stops.\n\n\nThe data of this study also do not compare well with those reported\nfrom Cantonese ( Iwata et al. 1981 ) and Fukienese ( Iwata et al. 1979 )\nwhere unvoiced unaspirated syllable- or word-final stops were produced in\naddition to the closed glottis with a cetain degree of glottalization. \n\n\n \n\n  Voiced Unaspirated Stops   .\n\n\nThe spatiotemporal patterns of glottal dynamics for the voiced\nunaspirated stops are shown in Figure 2.   \n\n \n\nFor all four words in this figure, the glottis begins to close\nrapidly from a respiratory open position and reaches a closed position\nconsiderably prior to the articulatory release of the initial stops and\nthereafter remains closed throughout  the rest of the\nduration of these words.\n\n\nAt or somewhat after the articulatory release of the final stops in\nthe words / bibib/, / didid/ and / didid/ <*> dots below the three ds </*> ,\nthe glottis starts opening and then moves rapidly toward a respiratory open\nposition; the word / gigig/ is an exception, where the glottis continues to\nremain closed after the articulatory release of the final stop.\n\n\nThese results are generally in agreement with those reported on the\nvoiced unaspirated stops in the other Hindi studies ( Dixit and MacNeilage\n1974; Dixit 1975; Kagaya and Hirose 1975; Benguerel and Bhatia 1980; Dixit\n1989 ) , and in the studies on Dutch ( Slis and Damste 1967 ) , French (\nBenguerel et al. 1978 ) , Fukienese ( Iwata et al. 1979 ) , Japanese (\nSawashima 1968 a, b; Sawashima et al. 1975 ) , Maithili ( Yadav 1984 ) , and\nTibetan ( Kjellin 1977 ) .\n\n\nIn these studies, like the present study, the voiced unaspirated\nstops were produced with an adducted and vibrating glottis.\n\n\nIn spite of the fact that in English ( Lisker and Abramson 1964;\nLadefoged 1975 ) and Swedish ( Lindqvist 1972; Fant 1973 ) , the so-called\nvoiced stops are truly voiced only in word-medial intervocalic position, in\nother positions they may or may not be voiced, most of these stops in all\nword positions in these languages were produced with an adducted glottis (\nAbramson et al. 1965; Lisker et al. 1969, 1970; Sawashima 1970; Sawashima et\nal. 1970; Cooper et al. 1971; Lindqvist 1972 ) .\n\n\nIn some cases of these stops in both English and Swedish, however,\nsome glottal opening was observed.\n\n\nSome glottal opening was also observed in a few cases of these stops\nin Dutch and French.\n\n\nIn contrast, all of the so-called voiced stops of Danish (\nFrojaer-Jensen et al. 1971; Fukui and Hirose 1983; Hutters 1985 ) and\nIcelandic ( Petursson 1976; Lofqvist and Yoshioka 1981 ) were produced with\nan open glottis an cessation of glottal vibration, thus they were\nphonetically realized as unvoiced unaspirated stops in both languages.\n\n\nOccasional glottal openings observed in the production of the\nso-called voiced stops have been attributed to active adjustment of the\narytenoids in English ( Lisker et al. 1970; Sawashima 1970) and to the\nincrease in oral air pressure in Swedish ( Lindqvst 1972 ) .\n\n\nSince the so-called voiced stops of Danish were produced with\nactivation of the abductor and suppression of the adductor laryngeal muscles\n( Fischer-Jorgensen and Hirose 1974; Hutters 1985 ) , the glottal opening\nobserved during their production can be ascribed to active arytenoid\nadjustment.\n\n\nLofqvist has suggested that glottal opening observed in the so-called\nvoiced stops of Icelandic also results from active adjustment of the\narytenoids ( see Dixit 1989 )", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "68164856-3330-410e-b41d-b5b933a6ae63", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.060296+00:00"}
{"text": "Rare Violin  jugalbandi   \n\n \n\n  CONSISTANT   with its glory as\nculturally the most active organisation the Andhra Pradesh Bhavan had\narranged a three-day Thyagaraja Music Festival last week.\n\n\nA rare item in the series was the violin  jugalbandi \nwith Peri Sriramamurthy playing Carnatic and P. S. Ghotikar the\nHindusthani music.\n\n\nThe former is among the best violinists of the country and he proved\nhis mettle in  Kharaharapriya ( Pakkala)  .\n\n\nViolin has not been adopted that widely in Hindusthani field and it\nwas not an easy task for Ghotikar to match the brilliance of Sriramamurthy.\n\n\nThe choice of the  raga  played by the Hindusthani\nviolinist did not also correspond fully with  Kharaharapriya\n .\n\n\nHe played a  janya raga  which would have matched\n Salagabhairavi  better.\n\n\nThe Carnatic version of  Yamunakalyani  was\nclassically fitting while the other one was rather lightened, with traces of\na  thumri  or  pahadi  approach.\n\n\nMridangist Ravi and Tablist Nagaraj gave zestful support in this\nsatisfying concert. \n\n \n\nThe most important item in any Thyagaraja Festival is the group\nsinging of the  Pancharatna Kritis  - - the five gems.\n\n\nIt was a very thoughtful idea to have a left the job to  Smt.\n Akhila Krishnan who presented the songs with her able disciples, in\nperfect unison and understanding.\n\n\nNoted participants in the    troupe \n were Dipti Bhalla and Indira Jagadacharya.\n\n\nThe most melodious and moving part of the festival, however, was\nthe presentation of  immortal  Divyanama\nSankeertanams  by the Guruguha Choir of Delhi on the inaugural day.\n\n\n \n\nAIR National programme last Saturday was by Mani Krishnaswami.\n\n\nIt was about her best performance in recent times.\n\n\nShe seemed to have worked hard in rehearsing all the items to\nperfection.\n\n\nAll the kriti renditions were impeccable and the concertplanning\nwas meticulous.\n\n\n Alapanas  of  Panthuvarali ( Sankari \nby Mysore Vasudevathar) and  Todi  had both manly weight and\nfeminine grace.\n\n\nIt was a pleasure to listen to  Needaya  , that rarely\nsung  Kriti  in  Todi  .\n\n\nIt was Peri Sriramamurty here too who filled the broadcast with\nsteady flow of melody.\n\n\nK. R. Ganesh  ( Mridangam)  and V. Suresh  (\nGhatam)  collaborated admirably in making the programme the success\nit was.\n\n\nMani Krishnaswamy was on the  Doordarshan \nnational hook-up only the other day and this national programme has come\nin rather too quick in succession.\n\n\nThere should be some better coordination between the two government\nmedia.  \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n  Ramanna on the piano  \n\n \n\n DR.  RAJA RAMANNA  is firstly\na physicist of international stature.\n\n\nHe is also now our Minister of State for Defence.\n\n\nThe astonishing fact is not that Dr. Ramanna plays the piano.\n\n\nMany gifted men and women follow contrasting and sometimes mutually\ncontradictory interests and do passably well in these pursuits.\n\n\nBut that Dr. Ramanna plays the piano with such appeal, such a subtly\nshaded touch and a pedal technique that gives his style such a dreamy\nreflective quality, it is this that strikes the listeners with surprise\nand pleasure. \n\n \n\nAt a concert sponsored by the Music Salon The Cultural Department\nof the USSR Embassy in association with  Swaralaya  Dr. Raja\nRamanna played a selection of compositions from the Romantic tradition\nbeginning from this century backwards to Beethoven.\n\n\nPandit Ravi Shankar was the Chief Guest on the occasion. \n\n \n\nDr, Ramanna opened the concert with a piece named  `\nRhapsody'  by the composer Erno Donhanyi, a flowery little piece full\nof whimsey with shining little passages and mincing little runs on the scale.\n\n\nThereafter it was business right through.\n\n\nRamanna went into Liszt in right earnest and revealed a lustrous\ntechnique that his duties as Minister do not seem to have touched. \n\n \n\nObviously in red hot practice, he played Liszt with a kind of\nabandon beginning with the Liszt Paraphrase from Rigoletto with flying\nruns on the scale with his notes seeming to be sliced as though with a\nscalpel, very delicate and light despite the bloody goings on in the opera.\n\n\nThen he went on to another Liszt, a  ` benediction'  ,\na three movement piece hymn-like in its utterance spreading out in placid\nmeadows of notes fanning out of the  fingertips.\n\n\nHe followed this with a Beethoven Sonata, not the Moonlight, but the\nF. Sharp major in two movements played in a reined-in sort of way letting\nthe passages tell its own tale.\n\n\nThen there were some Chopin Preludes, which with the kind of scale\nexercises that Ramanna seems to have worked on, came out with a richness\nof texture that did the evening proud. \n\n \n\nHe concluded with another Liszt.\n\n\nWhat came out of the concert in no uncertain terms was the feeling\nhow much Dr. Ramanna cared for his art to give his playing technique that\nfeel of urgency which not even the duties of a Minister of Government could\ndiminish.  \n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n  Good solo violin  \n\n \n\n  ACCOMPANYING   and solo\nplaying are skills of a different nature, each having its own advantages\nand disadvantages.\n\n\nAn accompanist must be a versatile artiste who could meet a variety\nof musicians of different styles on the platform while a soloist can manage\nwith his own crammed stuff.\n\n\nBut the soloist becomes the main performer and the responsibility\nof the success or otherwise of the concert would fall on him and not so if he\nwere to be an accompanist.\n\n\nA violinist would be justified in demanding a solo platfom only if he\nsurely has some original stuff of his own which he has no opportunity to\nexhibit as an accompanist. \n\n \n\nMadras had been the commerical capital for Carnatic music since\nthe time of Patnam Subramanya Iyer.\n\n\nMost of our musicians live there more in search of limelight than for\nany love of the place.\n\n\nTo have made a name in the the field while living in far off Delhi is\nan achievement within the capacity of less than a handful of artistes and P.\nSunder Rajan is one of the few whose solo violin performance was featured\nlast week joinly by South Delhi Music Circle and Svaralaya.\n\n\nHe took time to warm up.\n\n\nThe  Kalapramanam  did not quite mesh in the first two\nitems  Mahaganapati ( Nata)  and  Kapali ( Mohana)\n .\n\n\n Charukesi alapana  was brilliant.\n\n\nHe will shine better if a little more attention is paid to \n ` Sahityam'   .\n\n\nThe  Anupalllavi  of  Adamodi \nstarts in an elongated vovel   ` Toduneeda'  \nwhich he played with a  hrusva  note.\n\n\n Mridangam  accompaniment by V.

and almost implied\nuse which makes it a difficult task on the  sitar  , but one\nwhich Ravi Shankar essayed with great ability.\n\n\nThe combinations he presented during  jor  were many\nand varied, clear and imaginative, and with these he developed the \n  form which has reposeful grandeur, best suited\nfor  alaap  and  jor  . \n\n \n\nThereafter, the  gats  , set to  roopak\n and  drut ek-taal  , were switched over to yet\nanother sweet member of the great  Kalyan  family - - \nYaman Kalyan  .\n\n\nThe key note - -  shuddha madhyam  - - which\ndifferentiates the  raga  from  Yaman \nitself was most appropriately, though somewhat sparingly, used, creating a\ntremendous appeal.\n\n\nThe  gat todas  were rich in rhythm and variety,\nespecially in the fast piece in which he preferred the  drut ek-taal\n to the stereotyped  teen-taal  .\n\n\nThe former has a rhythmic charm of its own.\n\n\nAnd it was in this    part   of the\nconcert that the listener-interest was further enhanced by the  tabla\n accompaniment of young maestro Shafaat Ahmed Khan.\n\n\nHis  theka  was perfectly proportionate to the needs\nof the main artiste.\n\n\nOccasionally, there were the usual signals for a spell of solo to\nwhich Shaffat adequately responded, drawing applause from an appreciative\naudience. \n\n \n\n Mishra Gara  , another delightful evening melody,\nwas presented in the post-intermission session in all its fullness through\ntwo  gats  , set to  teen-taal  .\n\n\nThe  alaap-jor  sequence was rightly dispensed\nwith.\n\n\nThe first in slow  teen-taal  was played in the\n thumir-ang  which admitted of bringing in shades of a number\nof other  ragas  , fitting in well through an occasional use\nof  moorchana  or change of scale.\n\n\nIt had a very pleasing effect and the  ragas  that\nappealed most were  Pilu  and bits of  Pahadi, Megh and\nHamsadhwani  .\n\n\nIn the fast piece one heard  gatkari  at its best,\nwhich included a number of intricate  tihais  .\n\n\nIt was a pleasing spell of rhythm and speed but not devoid of music.\n\n\nNot even in the climaxing crescendo - - whereafter the maestro\nreceived a standing ovation.  \n\n \n\n\n  A New status to  Vadya Vrinda   \n\n \n\n  INSTRUMENTAL   ensembles are\nnot new in our country.\n\n\nThere are references to  Vamsaka Brinda  (\nFlute-led orchestra ) and other types of ensembles in many of our\nancient texts.\n\n\nIt is infact the performance of solo human voice that is of a much\nlater origin but has since got so well established relegating the\ninstrumental groups to a diminutive status.\n\n\nAll India Radio has played an important role in keeping the\norchestral tradition alive.\n\n\nMadras and Trichy stations used to give enjoyable broadcasts of\n Vadya Vrinda  recitals playing highly clalssical music.\n\n\nIn the north, however, the  Vadya Vrinda  was\nconcentrating on sound effects on the pattern of Western symphonies,\nemploying Indian  ragas  but not classical  Kritis\n . \n\n \n\nIt was a refreshing experience to listen to a full-fledged\nNational Programme of orchestral music last Saturday.\n\n\nIt was presented under a changed name  Vadya Vani  and\nit was indeed different and superior.\n\n\nAll the items one would expect in a vocal Karnatic music concert\n Varnam, Kriti, ragam, Tanam, Pallavi, Swarakalpana  et al\nwere presented by the ensemble.\n\n\nThe composer and conductor of the  Vadya Vani  , Dr.\nPrapancham Sita Ram, deserves accolades for this new venture which was a\ngrand success.\n\n\nThe broadcast gave the satisfaction of having listened to a\nregular music concert by an ace musician.\n\n\n Viriboni ( Bhairavi), Varnam  glittered with an\ninatelligent mixture of contrasting gaits neatly manoeurved by the\nefficient participants  gaja ( Hansadvani) \nsounded a bit too fast but the  swarakalpana  was arresting.\n\n\nThe piece de-resistance was the  ragam, Tanam, Pallavi\n item.\n\n\nThe choice of instruments to do the  alapana  and\n Tanam  by turns was interesting and entertaining.\n\n\nThe  pallavi  was pregnant with technical\nintricacies.\n\n\n Gopuchcha Yati  in both the  laghus \nof  ata tala  seemed rather redundant.\n\n\nThe composer might have as well employed  srotovaha Yatti\n in the second  laghu  .\n\n\n Trikalam  , and other  vinyasams \nwere executed flawlessly.\n\n\n Jagadoddarana  and the  Tiruppugazh\n were lilting.\n\n\nIt was on the whole a very welcome variety from the routine \nsammelan  broadcasts only a few of which were highly relishable.\n\n\n Vadya Vani  is a commendable effort worth\nrepeating and continuing, under the baton of able conductors like Prapaucham\nSitaram. \n\n \n\nThe National Programme of music in  Doordarshan \nlast Monday was a bland show.\n\n\nThe artiste, G.

{"text": "PHATIC COMMUNION AND SECOND LANGUAGE TEACHING  \n <O>  C.R.S. SARMA <O> \n\n\n Andhra University, Waltair  \n\n\n ABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThe goal of language teaching is to develop the \nability to communicate through the target language.\n\n\nAttaining linguistic competence alone cannot be adequate.\n\n\nCommunicative competence enables the learner to relate the linguistic\nstructures to the social contexts and to select the appropriate structure in\na given context.\n\n\nSo the communicative approach to language teaching stresses the need\nto develop the  ability to respond to the situation in an\nappropriate manner with an appropriate structure.\n\n\nPhatic communion refers to a set of  ` ready-made' \nutterances with a conventionalized social meaning which are used to establish\nsocial ties between the interlocutors.\n\n\nLack of knowledge of these utterances often results in the  poor performance in the target language and also leads to his\npuzzlement sometimes.\n\n\nHence it is argued in this paper that teaching the utterances of\nphatic communication could be an integral part of all language teaching. \n\n\n 1. INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nA conceptual distinction is sometimes made between a second\nlanguage and a foreign language in terms of the availability of a territorial\nlinguistic reference group within the country and the learnability of the\nlanguage in formal as well as informal settings and the utility or the\nfunction the language in question may have in that society ( Stern 1983)\n . \n\n \n\nThe term second language has been used in this paper as\nsynonymous with any non-native language one wants to learn.\n\n\nThus, here it could include, for a Telugu learner, languages like\nTamil or Hindi for which environmental support is available within the\ncountry, languages like French for which such environmental support is not\navailable and, finally English too, which, even though lacking such native\nenvironmental support, nevertheless has a social, educational function within\nour country.\n\n\nThis is done so because, as Pit Corder ( 1973) puts it,  ` as\nfar as the learner is concerned both [ i.e. the second language and the\nforeign language] are equally strange'  .\n\n\nFor this reason, it is hoped that the conclusions of this paper can\nconfidently be generalized to all second ( non-native) language learning.\n\n\n\n 2. LEARNING LANGUAGES - ATTAINING COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE \n\n \n\nA person learning a language other than his native language may\ndo so for  a variety of\nreasons - business, educational, official, governmental, legal and so on.\n\n\nBut it is a well recognized fact by now that it is not enough to\nlearn the grammar of the target language or even to be able to produce\ngrammatical structures in the target language.\n\n\nIt is more important to learn and to know the appropriate\nresponse/structure in a given context.\n\n\nIn other words, linguistic competence alone is not enough if one\nwants to be successful in the target language.\n\n\nRather, it pays dividends to develop what Dell Hymes calls\ncommunicative competence, i.e. the communicative ability which helps the\nlearner select the socially and situationally appropriate utterance out of an\narray of the possible grammatical utterances in a given context and makes his\nspeech more acceptable to the native speakers.\n\n\nHence, the communicative approach to language teaching puts more\nemphasis on the social contexts, situations, speaker-hearer relations,\nformality or informality of the situation and so on.\n\n\nThus, Littlewood ( 1981: 6) states the following four broad domains\nof skill which a learner must attain  . 1)linguistic\ncompetence, 2) knowledge of the communicative functions of the structures, 3)\nskills and strategies to communicate meanings, 4) the social meaning of\nlanguage forms. \n\n\n 3. PHATIC COMMUNION - LANGUAGE TEACHING \n\n \n\nIn the light of and in conformity with the communicative approach\nto language, it is argued in this paper that due recognition be given to the\nrole played by what is called  PHATIC COMMUNION  in\nsecond/foreign language learning.\n\n\nAlthough phatic communion is entailed in the recognition of the fact\nthat linguistic forms have social meanings, its importance has not been\nhighlighted.\n\n\nIn any language there may be certain utterances which are not\ninterpretable in the literal sense, but which have communicative value\noverriding the semantic value.\n\n\nTheir potential communicative functions cannot be deduced from their\nliteral meanings.\n\n\nA perfect mastery of such utterances should obviously go a long way\nin improving the  performance. \n\n \n\nPhatic communion ( Malinowski : as quoted in Wardhaugh 1986 :\n277) is a type of speech in which ties of union are created by a mere\nexchange of words.\n\n\nOften they are  ` ready-made utterances'  as Lyons (\n1968: 1177) calls them.\n\n\nThese utterances of phatic communion are fully conventionalized\nsocial acts ( Allerton 1979: 14) and have a role-affirming function.\n\n\nMany linguists have recognized that often these utterances are empty\nof meaning and that the fact they are used at all is more important than\ntheir content.\n\n\nPhatic communion has been explained ( Berne as quoted in Leech 1974:\n63) as an adult substitute for the sort of reassurance a child requires.\n\n\nGreetings, farewell utterances and certain routine questions fall\nunder this category.\n\n\nTheir literal meanings may vary from language to language.\n\n\nFor example, the English  How do you do ?  and the French\n comment  allezvous  ?  ( = How are you going ? )\nand the German   Wie   ?  ( = How\ngoes it ? ) and the Tamil  ennange aale kaanooM  ( = What sir,\nyou are not seen)  are all instances of phatic\ncommunion.\n\n\nIn a majority of such phrases, their conventionally established\nsocial meaning overrides their literal meaning and their purpose is to\nestablish social solidarity.\n\n\nLeech ( 1974: 62 ) thinks that the function of these phrases is to\nmaintain cohesion within social groups. \n\n \n\nWhen a learner learns a language other than his own, very often\nsuch utterances come as a surprise to him whose social meaning evades him for\nsome time.\n\n\nBut until the learner is quite at home with them, his speech sounds\nalien.\n\n\nThus a knowledge of phatic communion seems important in at least two\nrespects: 1) it establishes social solidarity and correct equation between\nthe interlocutors, 2) the correct knowledge of such utterances saves the\nlearner from embarrassment. \n\n \n\nIt must be noted here that the literal meaning of these examples\nwould not probably convey the intended meaning in other languages.\n\n\nOnly functional equivalents could be used in such places.\n\n\nThe wrong equation of these utterances across languages may sometimes\nlead to misunderstanding because utterances whose social meaning is more\nimportant than their literal meaning in one language may be taken in their\nliteral meaning in another language. \n\n\n 4. PHATIC COMMUNION IN HINDI \n\n \n\n1. In Hindi, as in any other natural language, there are certain\nconversational openers ( which are used to initiate conversation between two\npeople).\n\n\nOne of them is the following:  1  )  aur\nsunaaiye   ` Please tell me'  ( lit.\n\n\nAnd make me listen) \n\n \n\nA Telugu learner of Hindi, unaware of this fact, will probably\nuse  boliye   ` please tell'  on the analogy of\nthe Telugu conversational opener  ceppaNDi   ` please\ntell'  .\n\n\nThough this is not unacceptable, it is nevertheless not frequently\nused. \n\n \n\n 2  ) Sometimes the above form may be followed by\nanother conversational opener as follows :  aur sunaaiye, kyaa haal\nhai?   ` Please tell me, what is the news'  ? ( lit.\n\n\nAnd sir, make me listen, what is condition.) \n\n \n\nThe learner, if unacquainted with such forms, may interpret it in\nits literal sense and is puzzled. \n\n \n\n 3  ) Yet another conversational opener is the\nfollowing :  aur kaisaa    chal   rahaa hai?\n  ` Sir, how is ( life) going ? '  ( lit.\n\n\nAnd sir, how is going?) \n\n \n\nAs is the case with the previously cited form, this form may also\nbe interpreted in its literal meaning, which may lead to the  puzzlement. \n\n \n\n 4  ) Another conversational opener of this kind\nis the following :  \nsaab, kyaa ho rahaa hai ?   ` xxx ( a name ) sir, what is\nhappening ? '  \n\n \n\nWhile this is just a casual enquiry in actuality, the second\nlanguage learner may be baffled as to its meaning, having interpreted it as\nreferring to some real event. \n\n \n\n2. Similarly, there are certain casual responses in Hindi which\nare solidarity-motivated and are  ` ready-made'  in nature.\n\n\nIf the second language learner is unfamiliar with them, he may find\nhimself tongue-tied in a conversational situation or is baffled when\nencounters them.  i)\n\n\n 1  )  bAs jindaa huu   ` o.k. I\nam alive'  ( lit.)\n\n\n 2  )  bAs    chal  \nrahaa hai   ` o.k.  going'  ( lit.)\n\n\n 3  )  gujar rahii hai   `  going on'  ( lit.)\n\n \n\n3. There is a casual compliment in Hindi which is very frequently\nused.\n\n\nIts nuances are numerous.\n\n\nThe variious situations in which it is employed and the different\nsenses it carries can be intriguing to the second language learner. \n\n\n kamaal hai   ` It is interesting, it is\namazing etc.' \n\n \n\n4. When young people seek their blessings, the elderly people\ngive the following blessing in Hindi.\n\n\nThis could be amazing to the second language learner.  \njite raho   ` keep living'  ( lit.)\n\n \n\n5. Finally, there is a form of enquiry which, though appears to\nseek information from the listener, is primarily motivated by the solidarity\nfactor. \n\n\n aap kahaaa ke rahane waale hai?   ` Where do\nyou come from ? ' \n\n \n\nThis seeks the place of origin of the addressee, but not the\npresent place of living.\n\n\nBut a Telugu learner of Hindi may interpret it to mean the present\nplace of living because of the Telugu construction,  miirekkaDa\nuNTunnaaru ?   ` Where do you reside ?  where the\nverb  uNDu  to reside'  is equated with the Hindi\n rahana   ` to reside'  . \n\n \n\n5. In addition there are some constructions which are used not\nsimply for the sake of establishing rapport, but also in order to elicit /\ncommunicate some information.\n\n\nAlthough such utterances may not be, strictly, part of phatic\ncommunion, they may be considered here for they too happen to be ready-made\nutterances and are to be learnt in toto by the learner in order that he\nunderstands those forms when others use them or is able to use them himself.\n\n\n \n\n 1  ) When someone wants to buy something but has\nnot mentioned the specific brand he wants, the shopkeeper may ask \ndekhiye saab, yeh    chalegaa   ? \n ` Look sir, will it be alright ? '  ( lit.  ` Look\nsir, will it go ?  '   ) \n\n \n\n 2  ) When someone is looking for a house, he may\nask  bhaai saab yeh  address  kahaa paRegaa ? \n Brother / sir, where is this address ( i.e. house ) ?\n ( lit.  ` brother/sir, where will this address fall ? '\n ) \n\n \n\n 3  ) In the railway stations, when announcements\nregarding the arrival of trains are being made, the following construction is\nnormally used.  ek  number platform  pAr  1720\nnumber  gaaRii khaRii hai   ` No.1720 train is (\nstanding) on platform number 1'  \n\n \n\nBut, in the railway stations in Andhra Pradesh, it has been\nobserved sometimes that the following construction is used.\n\n\n ek  number platform  pAr  1720 number\n gaaRii hai   ` number 1720 train is on platform number\n1'  \n\n \n\nThe source of this construction, probably, is the Telugu\nconstruction which is as follows.  okaToo  number platform\n miida  1720 number  raylu unnadi   `\nnumber 1720 train is on platform number 1'  \n\n\n  6. CONCLUSION  \n\n \n\nTo conclude, an attempt has been made to highlight the importance\nof some conventionalized utterances, usually called phatic communion, in\nspeech interaction in establishing social relationships.\n\n\nEvidently, such conventionalized utterances need to be taught to the\nsecond language learner in order to improve his performance in the target\nlanguage.  \n\n\n NOTES   1\n\n\nWilkins ( 1972) however, makes a threefold distinction, viz. The\nsecond, Foreign and Alternate languages.\n\n\nAccording to him, the Second language does not have native speakers\nwithin the country in question.\n\n\nFor him, it is an alternate language which has a territorial\nlinguistic reference group within the country.   2\n\n\nAlthough he states that they must be sought in foreign language\nteaching, it seems reasonable, in the light of the point made in the above\nsections, to think that they are equally essential in second language\nlearning situation too.  \n\n\n REFERENCES \n\n\nALLERTON, D.J. 1979.

\n\n\nHow is the work-in-hand progressing ? \n\n\nI do realise that there are many odds, you are facing\nand yet,  \nknowing you for all these years - - knowing what you are, I am\nquite sure  \nthat you will complete the project.  \n\n \n\nWith regards to self  Sau. \nVanajatai and love to  \n Chi  Girish and his wife.   \n\n\nYours sincerely sd/- \n\n   \n Shrigurudevdatta   \n\n\nMarch 12, 1997 \n\n\nRespected Sir, \n\n \n\nThank you for the call yesterday night. \n\n\nI also received your kind letter acknowledging the\n `  \nforms of permission'  that I had sent.  \n\n \n\nI hope and pray that both of you are in good\nhealth and your  \nwork is in progress. \n\n\nDo come to us on your way back from Hyderabad.  \n\n \n\nAs desired by you, I have just written a letter\nto Dr ( Mrs.)  \nDhongde requesting her to convey the message to her husband. \n\n\nI have also written that you are in the process of\ncontacting him. \n\n\nYou may  do so at your earliest so\nthat you will  \nhave some kind of assurance from his end.  \n\n \n\nWell, Dr.  health is not as\ngood as one would  \nwish. \n\n\nHe suffered a  ` silent'  heart-attack\nin the last  \nweek of July 96. \n\n\nAfter 3 weeks of hospitalization he is O.K. but with\nmany  \nrestrictions, no moving out, no climbing stairs, and a heavy\ndiet of  \nmedicines. \n\n\nThe doctor who treated him here had advised us to go\nto Pune for a  \nsecond opinion. \n\n\nWe were in Pune    between \n 16 and 25  \nFeb., when we had an appointment with a famous\ncardiologist Dr.  \nHiremath. \n\n\n He advised a few tests which\nincluded  \nangiography and on the basis of it he has suggested bipass\nprocedure. \n\n\nWe are now exploring the possibilities     regarding   when, where, by whom etc. \n\n\nIn any case we want to wait till 31 March, when I\nshall be totally  \nfree.  \n\n \n\nOne good ( but equally bad ! ) aspect of the\nissue is that he  \nhimself is most disinclined to even talk about his illness. \n\n\nLuckily, he is able and is allowed to move about in\nthe house, do a  \nbit of his astrological consultancy ( which keeps him   \noccupied and so happy    ;   it gives\nhim a chance to  \nmeet people without moving out. ) but to any query     \nregarding   his health he has a standard line - -  fine !  \nI - - all of  us - - are in a tricky situation\n- - a  \nhush-hush atmosphere ! \n\n\n very difficult to answer calls\nenquiring after his  \nhealth - - since he is always around ! Well, \nthat !  \n\n \n\nSir,    please   give a\nring when you  \narrive in Solapur on your way back.  \n\n\nWith regards,  \n\n\nYours sincerely, sd/-  \n\u001a", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "909ccdc9-5bf6-4bf4-bf22-fef638893b06", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.063836+00:00"}
{"text": "defiance  \n\n \n\nAt a time when the grave situation created by the eruption of\ncommunal passions in Karnataka calls for the  undivided\nattention, the Congress-I in Karnataka is caught in a crisis with Mr Rajiv\nGandhi asking Chief Minister Veerendra Patil to quit within four days.\n\n\nThe confabulations that preceded the decision and the manner of its\nannouncement make it clear that last  rash of riots have come\nin handy to jettison Mr Patil on the specious plea that the stroke he\nsuffered on September 24 has impaired the efficiency of the administration.\n\n\nThere must have been lapses on the part of the State government in\ncontaining the disturbances or providing relief to the riot-hit but there was\nlittle justification for the decision to axe the Chief Minister.\n\n\nThe decision to ask the Congress-I legislature party to meet on\nWednesday and to elect a new leader is undemocratic as there was no demand\nfrom among the MLAs for a change of leadership.\n\n\nMr Gandhi should have anticipated that Mr Patil might defy the party\nhigh command and create a piquant situation.\n\n\nWhatever the outcome of the present crisis, the State Congress-I is\nnot likely to enjoy stability.\n\n\nIt also proves that the claim that Central leadership of the party had\nsmooth ties with the governments headed by the Congress-I was wrong. \n\n \n\nMuch before Mr Patil fell ill, it was apparent that he had lost\nfavour with the Congress-I high command as he was suspected of building up a\npower base for himself.\n\n\nAs criticism of his style of functioning began to be voiced openly,\nMr Patil found himself engaged more and more in a rearguard battle to save\nhis chair.\n\n\nMr Patil could not have been unaware of the design behind the growing\ncriticism, notably by AICC-I general secretary C.K.\n\n\nJaffar Sharief.\n\n\nThe continuance of the tirade, despite Mr Rajiv \npersonal assurance to the Chief Minister that Mr Sharief will be pulled up,\nonly underscored the fact that it had the blessings of the high command.\n\n\nMuch the same scenario obtains in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, where\nDr Chenna Reddy has been pinned down by the dissidents.\n\n\nIn view of the Congress-I high  antipathy to\nleaders who prefer to stand on their feet and the general tendency of\nlegislators to safeguard their political future by looking to Delhi for\nguidance, Mr Patil stands to gain little by his defiance unless he has chosen\nto pursue his career under a different party label.\n\n\nIt is not certain yet that by asking Mr Patil to quit Mr Rajiv Gandhi\nis conveying a message to Dr Chenna Reddy and Mr Sharad Pawar that he\ncontinues to believe that as party President he will decide who should rule a\nState.\n\n\nBut the two Congress-I Chief Ministers are likely to read meanings in\nthe ongoing developments in Bangalore.  <*> line in the middle </*>\n\n\n  Congressman to the core  \n\n \n\nKamlapati Tripathi was a product of Varanasi and what it\nrepresents - - and of the freedom movement.\n\n\nThough he was on the Delhi scene for nearly two decades, it was\nfitting that he went back to Varanasi to breathe his last.\n\n\nLike Govind Ballabh Pant and Lal Bahadur Shastri, he left Lucknow\nwith reluctance.\n\n\nThat he did not rise to the stature of the other two in national\npolitics was due in part to the different nature of politics during his time\nin Delhi.\n\n\nThough he was totally loyal to his leader, like Shastri was to Nehru,\nin Mrs Indira Gandhi he had a person who, unlike her father, would not like a\nperson to bcome too powerful, particularly in her home State.\n\n\nIt would not be unfair to say that he did not show the same degree of\nadministrative skill as the other two.\n\n\nHe was forced to resign as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh after the\nPAC revolt in 1973 and then again as Railway Minister in 1980 following Mrs\n criticism of the way he was handling the portfolio. \n\n \n\nKamlapati Tripathi was essentially a political being and must\nhave revelled in the ways of Congressmen of his days, but he also understood\nits principles and ideology.\n\n\nHe joined the Congress at the age of 15 to fight in the freedom\nmovement and when he died on Monday at the age of 85 he was still a party\nmember - - one moreover who had never defected or even wavered in his loyalty\nto the party which he thought was the only one which could rule India.\n\n\nBut somehow he equated loyalty to the party to loyalty to four\ngenerations of the Nehru clan.\n\n\nHis support for Mrs Gandhi during the 1969 and 1978 splits in the\nCongress was crucial for her specially in the most populous State of Uttar\nPradesh.\n\n\nDespite Mrs  nature, she recognised this trait in\nhim and made him working President of the party in 1983.\n\n\nBut loyalty alone is not of permanent value.\n\n\nHis influence declined during Rajiv  tenure as Prime\nMinister.\n\n\nBut maybe the latter would have been better off had he listened to\nhis sage advice.\n\n\nThe loss has been that of Mr Rajiv Gandhi. \n\n \n\nLike Jawaharlal Nehru, Pandit Kamlapati Tripathi had a deep\nbelief in secularism.\n\n\nThis was all the more notable for unlike Nehru he was an orthodox\nHindu whose morning  puja  could not be disturbed on any\ncount.\n\n\nThis belief was epitomised last year when he spoke out against the\nmove to demolish the Babri Masjid, in fact saying he would physically try to\nstop this happening.\n\n\nThis standing by a principle in the face of rising fanaticism is a\ntrait in short supply among our leaders these days.\n\n\nIn his person he reflected a tolerant and composite culture that used\nto be  pride - - as also of India.  <*> line in\nthe middle </*>\n\n\n  A matter of shame  \n\n \n\nThe cruellest aspect of a dismal showing at an international\nsports meet is that the participants tend to get all the blame.\n\n\nThe nation will doubtless be disappointed with  gold\ndrought at a Beijing Asiad which ended on Sunday.\n\n\nBut it would be unkind to hold the athletes and other sportspersons\nresponsible for the failures in their medal hunt.\n\n\nIt is possible some of them did not deserve to be in the squad, but\nmade it to Beijing through favours.\n\n\nBut there is no need to doubt the genuineness of the efforts of most\nof them.\n\n\nThe cause of  worst performance in Asian Games in\ntheir 40-year history is to be found elsewhere.\n\n\nThe record book will note that the only gold India won was in\nkabaddi, which South Asians have played for generations and others are barely\nfamiliar with.\n\n\nThe cynics predict even this gold will elude India at the next Asiad\nat Hiroshima, for four years are enough time for the Chinese or Koreans to\nreach the level of excellence in any game.\n\n\nIt had been hoped India would win seven or eight golds in a medal\ntally of around 45.\n\n\nBut the tally of 23 medals is barely half of the modest expectations.\n\n\n \n\n sports-politicians own it to the nation to\nabsolve themselves of the charge that they have done the most to bring shame\non the country.\n\n\nFavouritism and nepotism and faction fights begin at the level of\npolitical administrators of sports.\n\n\nThe disgusting tug-of-war between factions of officials over who\nshould represent India at Beijing not only made this country an object of\nridicule, but must have affected the morale of the Indian competitors in the\nChinese capital.\n\n\nThis event alone should propel the Government of India to take a hard\nlook at the entire question of sports administration, creating facilities\nlike playgrounds, swimming pools and stadia, and the way our sportsmen and\nwomen are being groomed and trained.\n\n\nWhat is at stake is not the gold, but to ensure that we are not\npushed out of even the bronze spot.\n\n\nThe Government should rise above petty political considerations in\nselecting the persons who will administer sports, pool the best brains that\ncan advise on recruiting domestic and international coaches, and help in the\npreparation of a rigorous plan to raise sports standards, preferably within a\ntwo or five-year time-frame.\n\n\nThere is no time to lose in finding out why we have been sliding down\nwhile other countries are constantly improving their performances.  \n\n\n\n\n  Unstable UP  \n\n \n\nHaving played a key part in precipitating the Janata Dal split at\nthe national level, Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav naturally finds himself embroiled\nup to his neck in its fallout in his home State of Uttar Pradesh, where the\ntwo factions are engaged in a desperate struggle for supremacy.\n\n\nThe advantage of having backed the  \" winning side\" \nat the Centre and the lure of governmental patronage in Lucknow may not be\nenough to help the Chief Minister ward off the threat to his position in case\nthe re-alignment taking place in the State unit of the party conforms to\nthe line-up in Delhi.\n\n\nIn fact, the reason why Mr Yadav has not declared his outift as the\nJanata Dal(S) even after expelling 31 MLAs could be because of the\nrealisation that he has not been able to muster the majority of the 210\nJanata Dal legislators to survive in office even with the support of the\n94-strong Congress-I.\n\n\nThough only 55 of the 96 MLAs belonging to the former Lok Dal(A) of\nMr Ajit Singh and Mr  Jan Morcha group have come out\nopenly demanding the dismissal of Mr Yadav, he cannot view with equanimity\nthe resignation of five Ministers, who have accused him of needlessly\nwidening the communal divide over Ayodhya.\n\n\nThe failure of the Janata Dal to elect a leader of the legislature\nparty after expelling Mr Yadav from the primary membership of the party\nprovides little consolation to the Chief Minister in view of the growing\nresentment among partymen at his  volte-face  in siding\nwith the Chandra Shekhar-Devi Lal faction after giving the impression of\nhaving been with Mr V.P. Singh over both Mandal and Ayodhya issues. \n\n \n\nThat the V.P. Singh camp also has not succeeded in enlisting the\nsupport of the majority of the legislators is evident from the statement of\nMr Ajit Singh that the election of the new leader would take place only after\nthe Chief Minister faces the trial of strength in the Assembly.\n\n\nThe new strategy adopted is to force Mr Yadav to seek a vote of\nconfidence, which would compel him to obtain Congress-I support in the House\nwith an effective strength of 423, where the backing of the 13-member Bahujan\nSamaj Party and the 30 Independents alone may not be enough to ensure his\nsurvival.\n\n\nWhile opposition within the State unit of the Congress-I to any move\nto bail out Mr Yadav is building up, the Chief Minister himself would like to\navoid this course in view of the electoral damage it could do to the platform\nof fierce anti-Congressism on which he had built his political career.\n\n\nThis has raised the stakes for the two factions in mobilising maximum\nsupport among legislators through all manner of inducements.\n\n\nIt is a measure of the success the V.P. Singh group has registered\nwith its campaign that in ditching it Mr Yadav has compromised on secularism\nand social justice that he felt obliged to prove his  bona fides\n by raising the reservation quota of backward castes in government\njobs from 15 to 27 per cent.\n\n\nWhile this cynical decision is unlikely to enhance Mr  pro-Mandal credentials, it has the potential of reviving the embers of\nthe caste war in UP.\n\n\nWhatever the outcome of the power struggle, the \nbiggest State is in for a period of political instability.  <*> line in\nthe middle </*>\n\n\n  What next in Gulf?  \n\n \n\nThree months after Iraq swallowed up Kuwait, the situation still\nremains poised between war and a diplomatic solution.\n\n\nExcept for American and British hawks and some in the Arab world,\nmost countries would prefer the latter.\n\n\nThe resumption of efforts to hold an Arab summit by Morocco has led\nto hopes that this might be in the offing.\n\n\nThe visits by Soviet envoy Yevgeni Primikov and Chinese Foreign\nMinister Qian Qichen to Baghdad among other West Asian capitals are in line\nwith the rejection by Moscow and Beijing of a military solution and search\nfor a diplomatic one.\n\n\nUS Secretary of State James Baker also could not rope in many\nSecurity Council members during his peregrinations abroad to pass a\nresolution immediately to authorise the use of force against Iraq.\n\n\nMore worrying in a way for President George Bush is the increasing\nopposition at home with Republicans, Democrats and others cautioning the\nPresident especially after his decision to send another 100,000 trops to the\nGulf.\n\n\nSome Senators are asking the President to explain why liberating\nKuwait  \" is in our vital interests\"  or why the US should be\nthe  \" sole policeman\"  with Senator Patrick Moynihan bluntly\nsaying that it will be a war which  \" cannot be won\"  and\nwarning that if a war takes place  \" we will leave the Gulf in ruins\nand we will destroy the presidency in the process.\" \n\n\nIt is thus doubtful if President Bush would be able to get\nCongressional approval for a declaration of war.\n\n\nIf he launches one without such approval it could divide the nation a\nsecond time since Vietnam.\n\n\nIt thus seems probable that short of an accident, war - - or at least\na land war - - can be ruled out. \n\n \n\nThose who have been to Iraq say that the sanctions have not begun\nto bite.\n\n\nThere is plenty of food and a relaxed atmosphere.\n\n\nOn the other hand most knowledgeable commentators are agreed that\nIraq ultimately will agree to pull out of Kuwait, except from some border\nareas including the Rumaila oilfield and a couple of islands.\n\n\nThis might not amount to punishing the aggressor, as some would like\nto, but it would certainly show that aggression does not pay.\n\n\nWar, moreover, would result in thousands of casualties and the\ndestruction of the oil wells.\n\n\nThe US and its allies also have to keep in mind that a military\naction would not only turn the Arabs against the United States but would make\nSyria and Iran stronger - - not an eventuality the West can view with\nunconcern.  <*> line in the middle </*>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e0599b8b-9d52-4da2-be4e-4f2b6c59d16f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.065205+00:00"}
{"text": "TAKING SIDES  \n  \n\n\n  Is the Greek word relevant today ?   \n\n \n\n It  could well be a sobering truth for a young\n\" MBBS \" aspirant to learn that cholera in England was\ncontrolled long before the cholera vibrio was identified under the microscope\nand much before anything like an anti-cholera vaccine was thought about.\n\n\nThe incidence of tuberculosis in UK had started declining much before\nstreptomycin was discoverd or the BCG vaccination invented.\n\n\nAnd the killer diseases, which continue to ravage \" Third\nWorld \" countries, were brought under control in the West not\nbecause of advances in medical science but as a result of environmental\nhygiene, better food and housing, which came as a result of a rise in living\nstandards. \n\n \n\nJust as the diseases of poverty can be controlled by prevention,\nso too can the diseases of affluence, now prevalent in the developed world -\n- through changes in lifestyle and by the control of environmental factors.\n\n\nThis is not to deny the relevance and importance of the curative role\nof medicine.\n\n\nBut the fact is that this role is only of marginal importance in the\npromotion and maintenance of good health conditions in a country. \n\n \n\nIn 1976, Dr Thomas McKeown, professor of Social Medicine at the\nUniversity of Birmingham, published a rather controversial paper in a medical\njournal.\n\n\nIn it he demonstrated, with irrefutable statistics, that health\nconditions in 18th century England had improved not because of the\ncontributions of the medical profession but because of improved nutrition and\nhygiene and the availability of contraception.\n\n\nLater enlarged and published as a book in 1979, Dr \n The Role of Medicine  is even today regarded as a pioneering\ncontribution to the area of medical sociology.\n\n\nIt is considered all the more significant because it comes from a\nmember of the medical profession itself. \n\n \n\n Who cares for medical sociology  ?\n\n\nUnfortunately, a typical class twelfth student,  \n swetting   for the joint entrance exam and hoping to make it to a\nmedical college, is unlikely to be advised by anyone to thumb through a book\nlike  \" The Role of Medicine  \" .\n\n\nNor is he / she likely to have heard of Ivan  even\nmore forthright and devastating critique,  \" The Limits of\nMedicine \"  , whose opening sentence reads :  \" The\nmedical establishment has become a major threat to health.\" \n\n\n( The word   ` iatrogenesis'   ,\nmeaning diseases caused by medical intervention, has entered the common\nvocabulary mainly because of Illich.) \n\n \n\nAnd it is perfectly possible that after completing\nfive-and-a-half gruelling years of medical education, the young intern not\nonly may not have read either of these books, but could be blissfully unaware\nthat there even exists such a field of study and research called medical\nsociology.\n\n\nThis is a real pity because health and disease are very much rooted\nin social, economic and political factors, and are not merely a question of\ndisease-causing organisms being attacked by a formidable combination of\ndrugs, doctors and hospitals.\n\n\nWhen medicine is taught and studied in isolation as a ` science'\nunconnected with the humanities, the inevitable result is the flawed and\noften unethical practice it has become today.\n\n\nNow health-care is a pricy commodity to be sold by health <quote > `\ntechnologists'  to those who can afford its exorbitant costs. \n\n \n\n  Two ends of a stick :  \n\n\nThis is not a difficult issue for taking sides if one happens to be\nat the receiving end of the health-care system.\n\n\nHowever, the same critique to which a ` consumer' would be receptive\nmay be quite unpalatable to one who is at the dispensing end.\n\n\nAs a patient you may be very keen to understand all about the\npolitics of health.\n\n\nAs a doctor ( or an aspiring medico ) would you be equally\nresponsive?\n\n\nThis is the crucial question.\n\n\nIf you are the sort who would like to be aware of what exactly are\nthe faults of the system you plan to join, and what you as a doctor could do\ntowards setting it right, then taking sides would present no dilemma, at\nleast at the theoretical level. \n\n \n\nWhere the problem really lies is in deciding how to go about\nchanging the system.\n\n\nThe solution is a complex one, and I personally have no complete\nanswers to it.\n\n\nBut, as I see it, understanding the system, and looking at it from an\nalternative viewpoint, is the first step towards changing it, and even daring\nto take this first step could be regarded as a major advance.\n\n\nLet us begin by recognising the issue. \n\n \n\n  What they don't teach at the medical college:  \n\n\nToday, some of us because of our exposure to various writings by\nsocial scientists, have become conscious of the socio-political dimensions of\nhealth.\n\n\nSome of us have  had the opportunity to\ninteract with doctors in the  ` rational health'  movement who\nare trying to raise awareness among the public and influence the government\nto make its health policy more relevant to the needs of the people.\n\n\nThe experience of the socialist countries has proved to us that the\nhealth standards of a country, even when it has limited resources, can be\ndramatically raised by simple public health measures and social reforms.\n\n\nAnd both these need political will and not sophisticated medical\ntechnology.\n\n\nDoctors in activist health groups point out that none of this is\ntaught in medical colleges.\n\n\nThey also add that in their efforts to transform the health-care\nsystem, the most powerful obstacles they encounter come from the medical\nprofession itself.\n\n\nAnd one of the several reasons for this is the faulty orientation of\nmedical education. \n\n \n\nLast year, in a detailed critique of medical education, Dr N.H.\nAntia of the Foundation for Research in Community Health had commented that\nit is the  \" glamorous, high-tech and lucrative\"  specialities\nwhich medical students aspire to take up, even though preventive and social\nmedicine are the real determinants of health.\n\n\nThis is a built-in distortion fostered by the curriculum, and it has\nresulted in the commercialisation of health into what he calls an  \"\nillness-business\"  .\n\n\nIt is a distortion caused by a narrow emphasis on medicine as a\nscience and a technology with absolutely no components in a \ntraining from the field of social sciences. \n\n \n\nHowever, even an idealistic medical aspirant is bound to protest\nthat reforming the curriculum is beyond the scope of a student, and such an\nargument would certainly be justified.\n\n\nBut only up to a point. \n\n \n\n  Educating ourselves :  \n\n\nThere are many things we can do on our own to become better informed\nand more sensitive and do not have to rest content with blaming everything on\nthe syllabus.\n\n\nFor example, Dr Antia, in his recommendations for reorienting medical\neducation, has suggested the inclusion of health-related humanities which are\nconspicuous by their absence in the medical curriculum.\n\n\nBut syllabus reform takes time and it is open to young medical\nstudents to read up on their own and arrive at a more  perceptive and enlightened understanding of the role of their profession\nin relation to the society in which they live.\n\n\nSuch a broad approach to their subject can only make them better\ndoctors, so they really have nothing to lose. \n\n \n\nOne could emphasise here that some of the shortcomings in medical\neducation are common to all specialised science courses.\n\n\nIn all the high-status professions to which science education leads,\nthe truly sensitive and socially responsible practitioners are the ones who\nhave a thorough understanding of the socio-political milieu in which they are\nrooted.\n\n\nThey derive this perception not from the prescribed textbooks, but by\nstaying alive to the realities around and by reading up on their own. \n\n \n\nUnfortunately, right from the middle-school level, the ` high\nachieving' student is encouraged to regard the humanities as infra dig and\nunless the typical science student is  willing and able\nto overcome this prejudice, he/she is more likely to end up perpetuating\nrather than trans-forming the ills of the health-care system. \n\n \n\n  Seek and find :  \n\n\nFor a science student who acknowledges the need to have a better\nunderstanding of social phenomena, and is genuinely seeking\ninformation, fortunately there is plenty of material available.\n\n\nThe two classics by McKeown and Illich are fine for starters.\n\n\nAnother is the ICMR-ICSSR joint document entitled  Healthy for\nall: an alternative strategy  ( 1980), which could be a real eye-opener\nfor an Indian student.\n\n\nBesides, there are a number of health-action and \nscience groups in this country which could prove to be rewarding sources of\ninformation as well as inspiration since many of their members are themselves\npractitioners of medicine.\n\n\nTo name three, there is the \"  Kerala Sastra Sahitya\nParishad  , the Medico-Friend Circle and the Voluntary Health\nAssociation of India. \" \n\n \n\nOf course, all this is only part of the first step of\nunderstanding that there are issues related to health which are not merely\nmedical.\n\n\nThis article has confined itself to the limited objective of drawing\nattention to an area which simply does not figure during the cut-throat race\nof trying to get admission into a medical college. \n\n \n\n  Health for all or wealth for some ?  \n\n\nTo sum up, the distorted priorities in health policy are a direct\nresult of the over-riding importance given to high-tech medicine and its\nmoney-spinning potential.\n\n\nThe status quo is maintained largely because of the medical  own vested interests.\n\n\nIt may be an uncomfortable truth to face but truth it undoubtedly is.\n\n\nWhen the WHO adopted  ` Health for All'  as its slogan\nin the early 80s, it was very emphatic that what the world and especially the\ndeveloping countries need is not costly, five-star medical facilities, but\nuniversally available primary health care. \n\n \n\nThis is hardly an exciting bit of information for the aspirant\ndoctor with high hopes of a glorious and financially rewarding medical\ncareer.\n\n\nIn this, as in so many other issues, the question inevitably boils\ndown to; self-interest or public interest ? \n\n \n\nA choice does exist even if it is a difficult one to make. \n<*> filled square </*>  <box> \n\n\n Progress in health \n\n \n\nTHERE IS ample evidence that by providing education and\nhealth-care, preventive more than curative, improvement in the health\nof our people can be achieved.\n\n\n performance in this direction is an eye-opener\nfor instance, over the past three decades infant mortality rate has dropped\nfrom 90 to 32 per thousand live births; and life expectancy has increased\nfrom 52.7 to 69.5.\n\n\nSri Lanka too has reduced its under-five mortality rate from 101 per\nthousand in 1960 to 35 in 1985.\n\n\n figures for the same period read: underfive\nmortality rate - - 152; infant mortality rate - - 96.\n\n\nwhile Sri Lanka spends 4.0 per cent on the basis of its per capita\nGNP on health,  expenditure is a mere 2.1 per cent. \n</box>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "COLOUR PHOTOCOPYING        \n\n\n Colour photocopying is  inexpensive and  relatively simple.\n\n\nIt may  one day pose an indirect \nthreat to colour  photography  \n\n \n\n  THE   colour photocopying\nmachine incorporates several technologies - - photostatic laser, colour\nseparation, computer and dye chemistry, apart from other electronic,\nelectrical and mechanical devices. \n\n \n\nIn black-and-white photocopying machines, the light reflected from\nthe document falls on a charged selenium drum and dissipates the charges\nselectively in the white areas as distinct from the dark written or printed\nmatter of the original document.\n\n\nThen the oppositely charged particles of toner ink adhere to the\ncharged areas on the drum.\n\n\nIn the next cycle, the ink is lifted on to paper to give a copy which\nis like the original document. \n\n \n\nIn laser photocopiers, a narrow laser beam is guided by a computer\nto selectively dissipate the charges on the drum of the photocopier machine.\n\n\n \n\nThe process used in colour copying differs drastically from that\nused in colour photography.\n\n\nThe dyes used in colour photography are not photosensitive.\n\n\nTherefore, along with the dyes, reactive chemicals which act as\nagents between the light and the dyes are coated on to the films and papers\non which the prints are to be made.\n\n\nThese chemicals carry the dyes to appropriate  \npoints on the image when the colour films and papers are\ndeveloped.\n\n\nOnce this is done, the dye image is stabilized by removing the\ncarriers and couplers in the agents. \n\n \n\nIn contrast, the plain papers used in colour copying are neither\ncoated with coloured dyes nor with reactive chemicals.\n\n\nTherefore, colour reproduction by the photocopier process\ninvolves, pigment application as in water-colour painting.\n\n\nWhen many water colours are applied successively in an overlay, the\npainted area appears black ( see box ) .\n\n\nHowever, the chemistry of the dyes used in colour photocopying\nin such that they do not react with each other when applied in overlay.\n\n\nThey are also spectrally transparent which permits them to show\nintermediate shades when overlayed by the dyes of other colours. \n\n \n\nAs distinct from colour printing, the colour separation technique\nused in colour photocopying consists of two separate steps.\n\n\nFirst, the original colour transparency, photograph or painting is\nphotographed onto three black-and-white films.\n\n\nEach film is shot thriough a filter of one primary colour ( cyan,\nmagenta and yellow ) under identical geometrical conditions, to give three\nnegatives of three subtractive primary colours.\n\n\nThese three negatives are then successively exposed through the same\nfilters onto the printing paper to give the natural colour photograph. \n\n \n\nIn the black-and-white photocopier machine for reasons of space,\nthe original document is scanned insuccessive sections by a moving\nmirror.\n\n\nThese sections are relfected onto a sensitized selenium drum. \n\n\n  Computerized scanning  \n\n \n\nIn a colour laser photocopying machine, the image of the original\ncolour document, photograph or transparency is first captured\nelectro-nically in each of the three primary colours in the same\nbrightness level.\n\n\nElectronic capture does not record the complete image as is done in\nphotography, but breaks it into a number of pixels ( individual picture\nelements ) in a process which is called  ` bit mapping'  .\n\n\n \n\nThe process occurs as follows: In the colour photocopier machine,\nscaning is done by a strip-line of charge coupled devices ( CCDS ) which\nare similar to tiny photocells.\n\n\nThese are arranged so that there are 16 CCDS per millimetre of\n1,728 to cover the width of an A-4 paper, a total of 5,000 in three groups,\none each in red, blue and green.\n\n\nEvery  \nCCD in the scanner or reader unit of the colour laser photocopier machine\ngenerates electrical voltages depending on the incident light, say 1 V\nwhen the brightest light falls on it and 0 V when no light falls on it.\n\n\nIn other words, the voltages generated by the CCDS can be in the\nstates  ` ON'  or  'OFF'  .\n\n\nThis is the binary code for feeding information into the computer.\n\n\n \n\n\nHow does the computer see the original document or picture ? \n\n\nThe compu-ter registers 1 V as one bit of information.\n\n\nTwo bits can count from 0 to 3, three bits from 0 to 7, four bits\nfrom 0 to 15, five bits from 0 to 31, six bits from 0 to 63, seven bits from\n0 to 127, eight bits from 0 to 225 and so on.\n\n\nNow an original document or photograph will contain an enormous\nnumber of microscopic parts picked up by the CCDS.\n\n\nEach part represents a pixel ( picture element). \n\n \n\nThese pixels, some several million of them, have to be entered in\nthe form of bits into the memory of a computer.\n\n\nTo accommodate the enormous number of bits into the built-in memory\nof a computer, the memory is given in kilobytes.\n\n\nA kilobyte is 1,024 bytes, that is, two raised to ten. \n\n \n\nAny black-and-white document or photograph can be looked at from\nthe point of view of shades of grey which are represented within eight\nclearly defined levels.\n\n\nThese eight levels are sufficient to take care of all the shades of\ngrey.\n\n\nThe light picked up from each pixel is given a value by an eight-bit\ndigitizer.\n\n\nThe position of each pixel in the document or photograph is fixed by\nhorizontal ( x) and vertical ( y) coordinates, each of which can be\naddressed by the computer.\n\n\nThe resolution of the copying machine affects the quality of\nphotographs reproduced.\n\n\nSo, in the case of the photocopier, it is the number of pixels which\nbuild the document or photograph.\n\n\nThe greater the number and the smaller the size of the pixels, the\nhigher the resolution of the copy. \n\n \n\nFor coloured documents or photographs, eight levels of shades\nare not enough, each of the primary subtractive colours require 32 shades\nat the minimum level of acceptability.\n\n\nConsequently, the pixel count increases enormously. \n\n \n\nThe information recorded after the electronic capture of the\noriginal colour document, photograph or transparency is digitized and\nthe pixels are stored in the  memory.\n\n\nThe computer can now be made to drive a laser and transfer the pixels\nthrough filters ( of three primary colours and black, for brightness levels,\nonto a photosensitive drum in quick succession - - a process remotely\nresembling pigment deposition in watercolour painting. \n\n\n  Colour laser photocopier  \n\n \n\nThe machine has two distinct components: a scanner with a\ncomputer and a printer.\n\n\nThe original colour document is lit by high actinic lights, its\nimage is reflected by a mirror onto a strip of CCDS arranged in three groups\n   behind the filters of each of the primary\nsubtractive colours ( red, blue and green ) . \n\n \n\nThe electronic signals picked up by the CCDS are sent to the\nprinter unit.\n\n\nHere the drum is first charged electrically to make it uniformly\nphotosensitive and then the electronic signals from the CCDS and computer\nare made to activate the build-in laser.\n\n\nThe laser is turned on and off depending upon the electronic signal\nfrom the CCD.\n\n\nWhen operated on, the laser strikes the photo-charged drum and\nneutralizes the charges in selected areas of the image, corresponding to the\ncolour of the original.\n\n\nThe regions of the drum not hit by the laser retain their electric\ncharges. \n\n \n\nThe remaining electric charges attract the toner of that primary\ncolour.\n\n\nThis cycle of wiping the charged drum by the laser and depositing the\ntoner on it is repeated for the other two primary colours and for black. \n\n \n\nThe toner of the three primary colours and black are lifted\nfrom the drum to the plain paper and fused there in a stabilization process.\n\n\n \n\nAt every stage, before the laser strikes the charged drum, the\ncomputer which drives the laser can be issued selective commands.\n\n\nThese commands can involve changing the colours, or editing parts\nfrom its bit map.\n\n\nEvery pixel can be addressed through the computer which can also be\nset to automatically monitor colour selecting, brightness and density so as\nto correspond with the original. \n\n \n\nOther built-in facilities may include reduction and enlargement\ncapacities limited to the maximum size of paper or the length of the drum.\n\n\n \n\nUsing the editing facility of the computer, a picture from one\nlocation can be shifted to another point on the same sheet or to another\nsheet, or its dimensions can be altered, as its bit map can be extended\nvertically or horizontally.\n\n\nAlso, reduction or magnification only in one direction is\npossible.\n\n\nA slide attachment permits enlarged plain paper prints in colour.\n\n\n \n\nUsing the editing facility of the computer, a picture from one\nlocation can be shifted to another point

<*> logo </*> \n\n  <box> \n\n\n REPRODUCTION OF COLOUR  IN PHOTOGRAPHY\n\n\n \n\n  THE    surface\ntemperature is over 6,000o C and its light energy reaches us as a\nbundle of long and short wavelengths varying according to the state of\natmosphere, presence of clouds, etc.\n\n\nThus the standard temperature of daylight varies from place to place.\n\n\nIn India, it is over 7,000 K while in USA it is about 6,500 K and in\nEngland about 5,200 K.\n\n\nUnder overcast conditions, the longer, less energetic wavelengths\nare stopped and the light reaching the  surface has a higher\nratio of shorter, bluer wavelengths, so its colour temperature may rise to\nbetween 8,000 to 9,000 K.\n\n\nTowards evening, sunlight becomes yellower and finally orange or red\nat sunset, for the lower the sun sinks, the greater the atmospheric haze\nwhich stops shorter wavelengths, increasing the proportion of longer\nwavelengths, and so the colour temperature drops.\n\n\nThus, the colour temperature of sunlight varies considerably. \n\n \n\nWavelength determines a colour - - when all the colours in the\nspectrum are present  ` white'  light is formed.\n\n\nPhotographically speaking, colour temperature tells how white the\nlight from the Sun or an artificial source is.\n\n\nWhen it contains mainly short wave-lengths, it will be blue-white,\nwhereas when it contains mainly long wavelengths it will be yellow-white.\n\n\nColour temperature of a light is compared with a black body heated to\nemit light of similar balance.\n\n\nThe temperature necessary for the black body to reach this light\nintensity is known as the equivalent colour temperature and is second in\nimportance to exposure in colour reproduction. \n\n\n  Colour objects  \n\n \n\nLight sources such as the Sun, stars, electric, gas and oil\nlights, candles, flash bulbs and electronic flash units are bodies which\nradiate ( electromagnetic ) light waves.\n\n\nOther objects are visible because they reflect light waves from light\nsources.\n\n\nBlack objects appear so because they can absorb all the light falling\non them ( incident light ) and reflect none.\n\n\nWhite objects are white because they reflect all wavelengths of\nlight, so white light is reflected as white.\n\n\nIf a white object is taken into red light it will appear red, under\ngreen light it will appear green and so on.\n\n\nThe colour we attribute to objects is that which they appear to be in\nwhite light. \n\n \n\nBetween black which absorbs all light and white which reflects\nall light are every colour and shade of the spectrum.\n\n\nEvery substance has its own particular wavelength absorption and\nreflectance construction.\n\n\nAbsorption and reflection characteristics are affected by adding dyes\nto some substances thus changing their colour.\n\n\nThe silver salts in films are by nature only sensitive to a narrow\nband of wavelengths; to make a film sensitive to all visible colours (\npanchromatic ) , dyes are added to allow it to absorb these other colours and\nthus record them. \n\n\n  Complementary colours  \n\n \n\nLight of complementary colours when mixed, produce white light.\n\n\nFor instance, white light can be produced by the following\npermutations and combinations: Red + blue-green = white Orange + blue = white\nYellow + violet = white Green + purple = white \n\n \n\nTo an artist, the primary colours are red, blue and yellow, but\nin photography, another set of primaries are used which are respectively\ncomplementary to the  primaries.\n\n\nModern photographic materials are sensitized to what are termed as\nadditive primaries.\n\n\nIn this system, the complementaries are bluegreen, magenta and\nyellow.\n\n\nThese are termed substractive primaries and are the colours of\nthe dyes used in the three layers of a positive colour print or transparency,\nthe final colours in the picture being formed by subtraction of colour\nfrom white light. \n\n\n  Colour print paper  \n\n \n\nPhotosensitive printing paper is prepared using three\nemulsion layers with a colour sensitivity similar to that of the exposed\nfilm.\n\n\nThe colour negative is placed in the enlarger, a white light is\nshone through it, then by using suitable colour filters, a record can be made\nof the original colour subject or each layer can be exposed in turn using\nfilters which cut out all wavelengths except those to which each layer is\nsensitive.\n\n\nDyes used in the final image contain the subtractive colours.\n\n\nSince printing is done on a white base paper, it is essential to use\nsubtractive colours.\n\n\nThus, white is represented by cleared unexposed emulsion in the\nthree layers allowing the paper base to show through the white.

{"text": "PROTECTING  \n\n\n MINORITY  \n\n\nRIGHTS  \n\n\nby A.G. NOORANI \n\n \n\n The determined efforts of American lawmakers and judges,\nbacked by public opinion and the media, have secured justice and equality for\nminorities in the United States.   <*> bold line below </*> \n\n \n\nThe word  \" minorities\"  nowhere occurs in the\nUnited States Constitution.\n\n\nWhen it was enacted 200 years ago, the concept did not figure in the\nreckoning of the Founding Fathers.\n\n\nIt is a tribute to the United States Supreme Court and the United\nStates Congress that the Constitution has been adapted with remarkable\nsuccess to protecting minority rights. \n\n \n\nNeither, however, could have accomplished much without the\nbacking of public opinion and the support of the media.\n\n\nAwareness of minority rights is a fact of American life today.\n\n\nOn February 7 last year, while the Gulf war was raging in fierce\nintensity, General Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - -\nand the first black to hold this position - - was asked about the role of\nminorities in the U.S. Army when he testified before the House Armed Services\nCommittee.\n\n\nThe General lauded the opportunities afforded to minorities in the\nmilitary but did not stop there.\n\n\nHe said with typical American candor, \" I wish that there were other\nactivities in our society and in our nation that were as open as the military\nis to upward mobility, to achievement, to allowing them in.\"\n\n\nNo society in the world can afford to be complacent about its record\non reconciling the diverse interests of a pluralistic society.\n\n\nAcknowledgment of imperfection is proof of integrity and maturity.\n\n\n \n\nIn the past three decades, the U.S. Congress has enacted\nseveral laws to protect the rights of minorities.\n\n\nThe most recent of these is the Civil Rights Bill of 1991, which,\naccording to the  Congressional Quarterly  ,  \" seeks to\nbroaden the reach and remedies\"  of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the\nmost comprehensive piece of legislation on the subject in the century. \n\n \n\nProposals for that landmark law were submitted to Congress by\nPresident John F. Kennedy in June 1963, a few months before his\nassassination.\n\n\nOnly the ardor and political skills of his successor, President\nLyndon Johnson, could have secured their enactment the next year. \n\n \n\nThe provisions of this statute are of abiding relevance.\n\n\nTitle II is the heart of the Act.\n\n\nIt declared all persons to be entitled to  \" the full and\nequal enjoyment\"  of the facilities of  \" places of public\naccommodation,\"  such as inns, hotels, motels, restaurants, motion\npicture houses, theaters, concert halls, and sports arenas,  \" without\ndiscrimination or segregation on the grounds of race, color, religion, or\nnational origin.\" \n\n\nThese guarantees were applicable to any establisment if it\n \" affects commerce or if discrimination is supported by state\naction.\" \n\n\nThis last was said to be present if discrimination was carried on\nunder color of law, was required by local custom or usage enforced by state\nofficials, or was required by the state itself. \n\n \n\nOther provisions of the law range over a wide variety of civil\nrights problems.\n\n\nTitle III authorized the attorney general to file suits to compel\ndesegregation of public facilities.\n\n\nTitle IV required the commissioner of education to conduct a survey\nof the lack of availability of equal educational facilities because of race,\ncolor, religion, or national origin and also authorized him to  \"\nrender school baords technical assistance\"  in preparing the\ndesegregation plants.\n\n\nIt also authorized the attorney general on complaint to institute\nsuits to desegregate public schools. \n\n \n\nTitle V empowered the Civil Rights Commission to investigate all\nsituations where citizens are deprived of the equal protection of the laws\nbecause of race,  color, religion, or national\norigin.\n\n\nTitle VI prohibited discrimination in any program receiving federal\nfinancial assistance.\n\n\nTitle VII created a five-man Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission, banned discrimination in employment on account of race, color,\nreligion, or national origin by employers, labor unions, and employment\nagencies; and gave the new commission power to enforce the law through\ninvestigations, hearings, and civil actions.\n\n\nTitle X established the Community Relations Service to assist\ncommunities in resolving  \" disputes, disagreements, or difficulties\"\n relating to discriminatory practices. \n\n \n\nOne area of weakness in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was its\nTitle I provision on voting rights.\n\n\nWhile race, color, religion, or national origin could not lead to\ndisenfranchisement, literacy tests and other devices had been used for years\nto disqualify blacks and other minorities as voters.\n\n\nTitle I incorporated a few measures  \" to provide more\neffective enforcement of the right to voice in Federal elections without\nregard to race or color,\"  but this accomplished little more than the\nacts of 1957 and 1960.\n\n\nAccording to Chief Justice Earl Warren, the ineffectiveness of these\nlaws stemmed from the fact that they tried  \" to cope with the problem\nby facilitating case-by-case litigation against voting\ndiscrimination.\" \n\n\nWrites Bernard Schwartz in  \" Statutory History of the\nUnited States: \"   \" Individual law suits could scarcely\nresdolve the problem presented by a system of mass discrimination <*> dotted\nline</*>\n\n\nBy 1965 only 71 cases had been filed by the Department of Justice\n<*> dotted line</*>\n\n\nA new and more drastic congressional approach was demanded.\" \n\n\n \n\nOn March 15, 1965, President Johnson, in an address to a joint\nsession of Congress, urged for new legislation to secure the right to vote\nfor minorities.\n\n\nTwo days later the Administration presented a bill to Congress.\n\n\nAfter relatively quick discussions in the Senate, the Judiciary\nCommittee, and the House, the bill was approved and signed by early August.\n\n\nAccording to Schwartz, it is  \" in many ways, the most drastic\ncivil rights statute enacted by Congress.\"  \n\n \n\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 did away with  \" any test or\ndevice as a prerequisite for registration or voting.\" \n\n\nIts effect was dramatic, as evidenced by the sharp rise in the\nregistration of black voters in just two years - - for instance, from 27\npercent to 53 percent in Georgia, 19 percent to 52 percent in Alabama, and\nseven percent to 60 percent in Mississippi. \n\n \n\nThe next landmark act came three years later.\n\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1968 outlawed discrimination in the sale or\nrental of all housing - - and not just in public or public-aided housing - -\nbecause of race, color, religion, or national origin.\n\n\nThe 1960s thus ended with significant statutory gains for the civil\nrights movement. \n\n \n\nThe famous American historian, Henry Steele Commager, had\npublished a series of his lectures in 1943 under the title  \"\nMajority Rule and Minority Rights \"  ( Oxford University\nPress ) .\n\n\nThe lectures did not deal with minority rights as we now know them.\n\n\nThey dealt with majority rule and limited government and the\nperennial theme of judicial review in a democracy.\n\n\nBut it is precisely from this outlook, which he so eloquently\narticulated, that concern for minority rights has grown.\n\n\nNo majority - - whether of opinion, religion, or other - - can\nhave absolute power.\n\n\nAbsoluteness belongs to certain values.\n\n\nEven so, at times competing values do clash.\n\n\nThat is where the judiciary comes in.\n\n\nThe courts had made small but significant attempts at protecting\nminority rights by citing older legislation - - the Thirteenth,\nFourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments to the Constitution that, respectively,\nabolished slavery, confirmed citizenship rights on  \" all persons born\nor naturalized in the United States,\"  and declared that race was no\nbar to voting rights. \n\n \n\nPerhaps the most effective provision was the guarantee of\nequality in the Fourteenth Amendment:  \" Nor shall any state <*>\ndotted line</*> deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\nprotection of the laws.\" \n\n\nAs former U.S. Solicitor General Archibald Cox recalls,  \" The\nSupreme Court decisions under the equal protection clause halted hostile\ngovernmental discrimination against blacks, Hispanics, and other ethnic\nminorities.\"  \n\n \n\nThe clause provided the legal basis.\n\n\nThe supreme  creativity did the rest.\n\n\nCox described its impact graphically;  \" At the same time that\nthe  sense of responsibility for individuals and\nminorities was growing, losers in the political process were becoming more\nconscious of the potentials of constitutional adjudication for achieving\ngoals not attainable through the political process, and they were also\nbecoming better equipped to use them.\n\n\nConstitutional litigation came to be conducted more and more by civil\nrights and civil liberties organizations, by radical political associations,\nand later by law offices funded to stimulate community action and provide\nlegal services to the poor.\"  \n\n \n\nThe letter of the Constitution had not changed but new life was\nput into the language in the light of the conditions of the times.\n\n\nThis is the essence of judicial statesmanship. \n\n \n\nThe doctrine of  \" State action\"  propounded by\nthe Supreme Court proved handy.\n\n\nTechnically, it means action by State organs - - executive,\nlegislative, or judicial - - as opposed to private action.\n\n\nThe doctrine, however, his even private action where some State aid,\nuse of State facilities, or any State sanction was involved.\n\n\nThe exclusionary policies of private clubs were hit by the courts\nthough congressional legislation did not cover them. \n\n \n\nThe  rulings over the years are a fascinating\nstory in themselves.\n\n\nThe  ruling in  Brown v. Board of Education \nin 1954 outlawing racial segregation in schools, needs no recounting\ntoday.  \n\n \n\nWith the  \" Bakke \"  case ( \n\" Regents of the University of Califormia v. Bakke  \" )\nthe Court entered, in 1978, the new and highly controversial field of  \"\naffirmative action.\" \n\n\nIt disallowed ( five to four ) the kind of explicit, rigid racial\nquota established by the university but upheld ( five to four ) the use of\nrace as a tool of affirmative action programs.\n\n\nThe majority ruling left intact the bulk of affirmative action\nprograms that gave special consideration to minority groups and women\nwhile sounding an alarm on rigid quotas.\n\n\nJustice Lewis F. Powell cast the decisive vote breaking a four -\nfour deadlock among the eight other justices.\n\n\nThe Court ruled that a university has a  \" substantial\ninterest\"  in a diverse student body that  \" legitimately may\nbe served by a properly devised admission programme involving competitive\nconsiderations of race and ethnic origin.\"  \n\n \n\nEarlier, in 1971, the Supreme Court had ruled in  \"\nGriggs v. Duke Power and Co. \"  that  \" discriminatory\npreference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and only what\nCongress has proscribed.\n\n\nWhat is required by Congress is the removal of artificial,\narbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers\noperate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other\nimpermissible classification.\" \n\n\nObviously, this may sometimes require preference to minorities to\novercome handicaps or to correct past wrongs. \n\n \n\nThus the  \" Bakke \"  ruling did not\ncome all of a sudden.\n\n\nIt had been in the making for some time.\n\n\nIn 1977, for example, in  \" United Jewish Organizations\nv. Carey \"  , the Supreme Court upheld a New York statute\nthat  \" deliberately increased the non-white majorities in certain\ndistricts in order to enhance the opportunity for election of nonwhite\nrepresentatives from those districts,\"  even if it disadvantaged\ncertain white Jewish communities.\n\n\nThree members of the Court, including Justice William H. Rehnquist,\nwho is now the Chief Justice, explained that  \" no racial slur or\nstigma with respect to white or any other race\"  was involved.\n\n\nIn 1979, after Bakke, in  \" United Steel Workers of\nAmerica v. Weber \"  , a five to two majority held that\nprivate employers could set up a quota system with separate lists for\nselecting trainees for a newly created craft program.\n\n\nIn  \" Fullilove v. Klutznick \"  six members\nof the Court led by then Chief Justice Warren E. Burger unequivocally upheld\na law that reserved ten percent of federal public works programs for\nminority contractors. \n\n \n\nThis case, decided on July 2, 1980, is of seminal importance.\n\n\nSection 103(6)(2) of the Public Works Employment Act, 1977, provided\nthat no federal grant would be made for any local public works project unless\nthe applicant gave  \" satisfactory assurance\"  that at least\nten percent of the amount of each grant  \" shall be expended for\nminority business enterprises ( MBE).\" \n\n\nThe expression was defined to mean a business of which at least 50\npercent was owned by minority group members or, in the case of publicly owned\nbusiness, at least 51 percent was so owned.\n\n\nThe minority groups were also specified by the provision - - American\ncitizens who were  \" Negroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, [\nAmerican ] Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts.\"  \n\n \n\nThe Supreme court upheld this law six to three.\n\n\nChief Justice Burger, delivering the judgment of the Court, observed:\n \" Congress had bofore it, among other data, evidence of a long\nhistory of marked disparity in the percentage of public contracts awarded\nto minority business enterprises.\n\n\nThis disparity was considered to result not from any lack of capable\nand qualified minority businesses, but from the existence and maintenance of\nbarriers to competitive access which had their roots in racial and ethnic\ndiscrimination, and which continue today, even absent any intentional\ndiscrimination or other unlawful conduct.\n\n\nAlthough much of this history related to the experience of\nminority business in the area of federal procurement, there was direct\nevidence before the Congress that this pattern of disadvantage and\ndiscrimination existed with respect of State and local construction\ncontracting as well.\n\n\nIn relation to the MBE provision, Congress acted within its\ncompetence to determine that the problem was national in scope.\" \n \n\n\n The letter of the Constitution had not changed but new life\nwas put into the language in the light of the conditions of the times.\n\n\nThis is the essence of judicial statesmanship.  \n\n\n In 1978 the Court entered the controversial field of  \"\naffirmative action.\" \n\n\nIt disallowed rigid racial quotas, but upheld the use of race as a\ntool of affirmative action programs.  <&> at the end of column ie the\narticle, \" about the author \" <*> line from left to\nright</*>\n\n\n About the Author : \n\n\n A.G.

The great man made a sardonic\ngesture,  ` I know that well enough,'  it said.\n\n\nHairy was struck by the brilliance of the man; he sat there with his\nmouth half-open.\n\n\nWithout his  level of astuteness and intelligence,\none could not hope to be a successful Realist of the highest order. \n\n \n\nThe more Hairy thought of it, the less it surprised him: in all\nhis clan, the Cousin came of the humblest family twig; the humblest branch\nbore the best fruit.\n\n\n parents had enough resources to send their only son\nto a university; but the  parents were petty shopkeepers, and\nwanted every son of theirs - - there were many - - to open his own retail\noutlet.\n\n\nBut this Cousin had other ideas, other plans, dreams - - what is a\ngreat man without his dreams - - and a Realist starts early.\n\n\nThe Cousin soon made a name for himself as a hard-working and accurate\nsteno-typist.\n\n\nHe joined the government service - - Hairy saw the ring finger of\nfate in  it - - and of course his parents resented\nhis decision.\n\n\nThe  talents were discovered - - you cannot hide\nlive coals for long.\n\n\nHard work, application and above all, loyalty to his boss, the\nSecretary to the Government, and then unflinching loyalty to the politician\nwho picked him for his personal assistant when he became a member of the\nunion council of ministers.\n\n\nThe  reputation spread - - you can tell the presence\nof a nightqueen even at a distance.\n\n\nHis reputation rose steadily, like fermenting dough, and after stints\nwith various low ranking ministers, the Cousin was spotted accidently ( Hairy\nsaw the hand, in fact, both bejewelled hands, of Fate here).\n\n\nEven Realists need breaks, only they work for them and earn them.\n\n\nThis cousin was picked up by the Big Man himself.\n\n\nUnprecedented rise, cried hoarse the  ` lectuals'  in\nEnglish newspapers, which nobody read, not the masses, anyway.\n\n\nMarvellous rise - - first bureaucratic and then political.\n Enemies\nof the Leader - - not just those in the opposition camp - - resented his rise\nand hated the cousin for his political instincts.\n\n\nWherever the leader went, he took the Cousin along.\n\n\nThe Leader took him, packed in his suitcase, so to say.\n\n\nPeople could see the ex-stenotypist sticking close to the Leader,\nfollowing his boss faithfully,just a step behind him, in due deference, in\nultimate humility; carrying the  speech for him and handing\nit over to him after the Leader reached the podium.\n\n\nNow everyone came to know that the speech, though penned by a senior\nIAS officer who prided himself onhis  craft, had been vetted\nby the Cousin with no academic qualifications except his high school\ncertificate, which was not worth anything anyway because the Cousin and the\nLeader were not of the same caste.\n\n\nWhat made all the difference was that having risen from among the\ncommon people of India, the  heart throbbed in unison with\nthe popular will, the public mind; his corrections and amendments made all\nthe difference between a campus closet and the public platform.\n\n\nAnd back in the capital, no appointments with the Leader were granted\nwithout first being screened by the Cousin, cabinet ministers and\nsenior bureaucrats waited eagerly for a phone call from him.\n\n\nThe Cousin knew, they all said, what was good for the Leader and what\nwas good for the Leader was good for the nation.\n\n\nGetting into the good books of the Cousin was imperative for the\nhighest in any sphere of public  114  activity; his\npresence at a cocktail party was considered enough to make the evening a\nsensational success; senior journalists - - and glamorous gossip columnists\nopenly fawned on him.\n\n\nBut the Cousin spoke little and listened a lot - - the true mark of a\nRealist.\n\n\nAll that he said, again and again, at every opportunity,was simple:\nhe may be drawing a salary from the Government of India, but his loyalty was\nreserved for one individual, his Leader, and for one family, the  family - - his son and  his  grandson when they came to power.\n\n\nJealousy, malice, slander couldn't stop the Cousin.\n\n\nAs everyone had expected, after the elections, the Cousin was inducted\ninto the central council of ministers. \n\n \n\n ` It has been a long time, Hari,'  said the big\nman, with quiet affection.\n\n\nSuch a memory for faces and names: Hairy felt ashamed; the last time\nhe had met with the Cousin was at the wedding of a cousin - - his    grandson - - and the big man\nhad emotionally put his arm over  shoulders.\n\n\nThat gesture had brought tears to  eyes; and the great\nman had said,  'Professor  saheb  , come and see us once\nat least.' \n\n\nBut Hiary had, most foolishly, not bothered.\n\n\nNow he felt too ashamed to raise the subject. \n\n \n\n ` Are you not interested in the post of Principal in your\ngreat college?'  the Cousin asked softly, looking at him for just a\nsecond, a mere glance, smiling, gentle, noble, while thumbing through some\npapers among the numerous files on his huge desk.\n\n\nHe pressed the button of the intercom and spoke to his PA for a\nsecond or two, turned to his desktop computer, checked the appointment again,\nreceived a call, gave instructions to his PA - - that had a call from the\nPrime Minister - - and then he came back to Hairy.\n\n\nHairy stood up, went round the stack of files, bent low and touched\nhis  feet,  ` I need your blessings .' \n\n\nThe Cousin asked him to go into the house and meet the family. \n<*> star</*>\n\n \n\nMrs  cousin too was a minister; and a minister\nof a higher rank than  Cousin.\n\n\nBut Mrs  cousin was a scholar who fancied his own\nscholarship; he had started his career asan IAS officer ( he got in at the\nvery first attmpt ) soon afterthe   independence and had climbed almost to thetop of the bureaucratic\nladder.\n\n\nThe he charmed the Big Man with his erudition in the privacy of his\nbedroom, was duly conferred the title of  Padma Shri  , took\npremature superannuation just before the last elections, stood for election,\nand on his election to the parliament, was inducted into the cabinet and\nentrusted with the portfolio of education and Culture.\n\n\nMrs Mocham had kept track of her  progress, had sent\nhim sweets and flowers at every ascending step and now decided to benefit\nfrom her investment. \n\n \n\nVisitors to Mrs  cousin were most impressed by\nhis study; all available space was taken up by books, not files; the scholar\nfound time to read books and also review themregularly even after his\ninduction into the union cabinet, in everything he wrote, he revealed his fine\ntaste for art objects and his enthusiasm for wildlife preservation.\n\n\nBut then he had the peculiar habit of looking away from his visitors;\nhe addressed his queries, disconcertingly, to some point on the wall next to\nthem or beyond or above them, as though he was addressing himself or an image\nof himself in an imaginary mirror.\n\n\nHis problem was he could not even contemplate talking to anyone\nbeneath him intellectually or morally.\n\n\nHe particularly resented any letters or petitions addressed to him\nwhich did not carry his academic and professional titles, especially those\nwhich did not acknowledge his Stanford degree or his title of  Padma\nShri  .\n\n \n\nMrs Mocham knew her cousin well.\n\n\nAt St Jaans, anyone who dared to talk to her without looking at her\nreceived from her the treatment he or she deserved; but now she commanded\nhidden resources of patience and forbearance and went through her interview\nwith her cousin without any mishaps; there was only one hiccup, and that at\nthe very outset when the big man asked her if she had seen his essay on\nPleistocene rocks of the Deccan in  The Illustrated Weekly of North Bengal\n and Mrs Mocham fumbled and stuttered and recovered quickly to make an\nearnest promise that not only would she read the article but she would get\nevery colleague and student of hers in St Jaans to read it and write\nappreciative letters to the editor of the learned journal.\n\n \n\nTo make up for her want of qualifications, Mrs Mocham suggested\nto her cousin that the most important factor in her favour  as far as the post of principal was considered was the preponderance\nof girl students in St Jaans.\n\n\nBut by then,the minister was already looking at the wall in the\ndistance.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d088767c-2c66-4829-832e-8f49a2cb8379", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.073071+00:00"}
{"text": "Biology of Mosquitoes - - \n\n \n\nEveryone is familiar with the word \" mosquito. \"\n  \n\n\nThese   are the tiny, fragile creatures which are  responsible for    nuisance   at our\nresidences.\n\n\nThey give us painful & itching bites due to which all of us  hate them  .\n\n\nMosquitoes belong to the order diptera & sub-order nematocera.\n\n\nMosquitoes are distributed worldwide & they are found    abundantly   in tropics.\n\n\nMosquitoes are  plenty near marsh areas & near water\nresources. \n\n\n  Identification  - - \n\n \n\nMosquitoes are tiny, fragile insects with a pair of wings.\n\n\nThe second pair is reduced to halters.\n\n\nThe body is covered with bristles or hairs.\n\n\nAntennae are plumose, the wings may be transparent or spotted.\n\n\nThey show piercing and sucking mouth parts with sharp stylets.\n\n\nBody is elongated with narrow abdomen. \n\n \n\nLarvae are comma shaped with a large head & thorax.\n\n\nThey respire with siphon being aquatic remain under water near\naquatic plants.\n\n\nThey are saprophagous. \n\n\n  Life history  - - \n\n \n\nFemale    mosquitoes   lay eggs\nnear the water body i.e. aquatic plants.\n\n\nThey may    lay   singly or in clusters\nas in the genus  Anopholes  eggs    lay \n singly &  in clusters in  Aedes  &  Culex\n .\n\n\nEggs are elongated boat shaped.\n\n\nEggs hatch in 2 to 3 days into larvae.\n\n\nLarvae are active and swim by wriggling movements.\n\n\nTherefore, the larvae are called wrigglers.\n\n\nThe larvae moult 4 to 5 times in 15 to 20 days.\n\n\nThe pupa is exarate type, adult emerges in a week.\n\n\nThe adult is    an   active flier.\n\n\nA female lays 840 eggs in her life span.\n\n\nThere are several generations a year. \n\n\n  Damage  - - \n\n \n\nThe mosquitoes give painful bites & itching lesions which causes\nirritation.\n\n\nThe mosquitoes act as vectors for different diseases.\n\n\nThere are three main  genus which act as vectors - -\na)  Anopheles  sps b)  Aedes  sps c)  Culex  sps\n\n\n\n a)  Anopheles  - - \n\n \n\nThese are small creatures with piercing & sucking mouth parts.\n\n\nThe males are harmless as they feed on nectar, but the females are\nblood suckers.\n\n\nThe females give irritating lesions.\n\n\nThey act as vector for diseases like \" malaria, 3 day fever,\ndengue fever, yellow fever \" etc. \n\n \n\nThe mosquito makes an angle with the substratum at rest.\n\n\nThe larvae of  Anopheles  cling to the water surface from\nbelow by making    an   angle with it.\n\n\nWings are clear & transparent with no spots.\n\n\nEggs    lay   singly in this genus.\n\n\n\n b)  Aedes  - - \n\n \n\n Aedes  is a small mosquito which is also called as\n ` tiger'  mosquito due to its striped abdomen and spotted\nwings.\n\n\n\" Aedes \" is also a blood sucker similar to the\nAnopheles mosquito.\n\n\nThe  Aedes  acts as a carrier for the transmission of\ndiseases like dengue fever, yellow fever, etc. \n\n \n\n Aedes  shows spotted wings & stripped abdomen, it does\nnot make    an   angle with the substratum while at\nrest & is parallel to the surface.\n\n\nThe female    deposits   eggs in\nclusters.\n\n\nThe larvae are bottom feeders, they are saprophytic by habit. \n\n\n c)  Culex  - - \n\n \n\nThis is the domestic mosquito which also gives painful bites.\n\n\nIt is not harmful with regard to the transmission of diseases.\n\n\nOnly a fever is observed.\n\n\nIt can be easily identified by looking at its sitting position.\n\n\nIt is parallel to the surface while  resting.\n\n\nThe larvae also lay parallel to the water surface.\n\n\nThe eggs    lay   in clusters. \n\n\n  Control  - - <*>  Preventive  - - \n\n \n\nBy    maintaining   proper\nhygiene, keeping the surroundings clean & dont allow the ditches or\ncollection of water near the habitation areas.  \n\n\n  Chemical  - - \n\n \n\nSpray kerosene over the water surface, spray melathion on the\nwater surface.\n\n\nDDT / BHC is recommended.\n\n\n  \n\n\n Biological control - - \n\n \n\nPredaceous insects like    dragonfly\n  larvae, dytiscid beetles etc can be used.\n\n\nFishes can be introduced into the water tanks. \n\n \n\nOther methods like use of mosquito nets, mosquito repellants, can\nbe taken under consideration. \n\n\n  Medical importance  - - \n\n \n\nThe mosquitoes are of medical importance as they act as vectors\nfor the transmission of different diseases.\n\n\nThe different genus like  Aedes  ,  Culex  and \nAnopheles  give painful bites & itching lesions.\n\n\nThey transmit diseases like \" dengue fever, \"\n\" 3 day fever, malaria, filaria, yellow fever \" etc.\n\n\nThese are abundant in tropics & such diseases occur frequently as\nepidemics.  \n\n \n\n\n  Biological Control  - - \n\n \n\nThe nature keeps a check on the population existing\nin nature by biotic as well as abiotic means due to which there remains a\nbalance in the different populations.\n\n\nSuch a method by using the natural means to keep a check on other\norganisms is called as \"  biological control  \" .\n\n\n\" Biological control \" is a natural process which\ngoes on    daily   but sometimes due to some or\nthe other reasons there is    an   out break of\ncertain individuals which are harmful for the human  \n beings   & when the cause damages 5 % above the level of\neconomical damage they are regarded as pest & for the control of such\nindividuals the biological control is used.\n\n\nBiological control can be done by various methods - - by employing\nthe preda--for-prey relationship, parasitoids, parasites, etc. \n\n \n\n( 1)  Predation  is one of the important tools of the\nbiological control.\n\n\nThe predaceous individuals feed upon the pest species & bring\ntheir    numbers   below the level of economical\ndamage.\n\n\nThese may belong to various classes in the animal kingdom. \n\n \n\nAmong vertebrates birds are the enemies of the insects, they\ncontrol their population to a large extent.\n\n\nThen there are reptiles,  amphibians & fishes which\nfeed on the insects & bring their number to a low level. \n\n \n\nAmong invertebrates, there are various insect orders which are\npredaceous which are listed as follows - -\n\n\n- >  a)   Coleoptera  - - \n\n \n\nThis is the important order which include various families\nfeeding on insects. \n\n \n\n i) Carabidae - - \n\n\nThe tiger beetles are entomophyous & feed on other insects. \n\n \n\n ii)   Staphylinidae  - - \n\n\nThese also  Rove beetle.  \n\n \n\n iii) Elateridae  - - fire flies \n\n \n\n iv) Coccinellidae  - - lady bird bettles etc.   - >\n\n  b)  Odonata  - - \n\n\nThese are entomophapous  in both nymphal as well as\nadult stages.  - >\n\n  c)  Mantoidea  - - \n\n\nManties are predaceous.  - >\n\n  d)  Hemiptera  - - \n\n\nThis is a big order with many examples of predaceons \ninsects - - i) Assasin bug ii) Pyrrochoris bug iii) Girrids iv) water\nscorpions v) water bug (    giant   ) \n\n \n\nThere are many more predaceous insects which act as biocontrol\nagents & bring the pest population to a low level. \n\n\n ( 2)  Parasitoids  - - \n\n \n\nThese are the creatures which parasitise the body of other pest\nindividual & lay their eggs.\n\n\nThese eggs develop in the body and they emerge out by killing the\nindividual.\n\n\nThese are called as \" parasitoids \" .\n\n\nThere are two main orders which parasitise individuals which are - -\na) Hymenoptera b) Diptera \n\n\n a) Hymenoptera - - \n\n \n\nIt is a big order & the individuals parasitise the individuals &\norder coleoptera, lepidoptera, hymenoptera, etc.\n\n\nThe main families of this order are the brachonids, ichneumonids and\nthe chalcids.\n\n\nThe brachonids are small with dull colouration, wings are without\n2nd recurrent vein & they are larval penasitoids.\n\n\nThe ichneumondids are shiny creatures with transparent wings & 2nd\nrecurrent vein is absent.\n\n\nThe chalcids are tiny insects with broad coxae & reduced  venation.\n\n\nThey all parasitise the individuals.\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThe other  families of the \norder hymenoptera are the - -\n\n\n Mymaridae - - \n\n\nThese are egg parasitoids\n\n\n Encyrtidae - - \n\n\nThese parasitise the individuals of homoptera. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFew more examples of parasitoids are the \"  Campoletis chloridea, Cotesia flavipes, Evania\nappendigaster  \" ( it is parasitoid on ootheca of cockroach ) .\n\n\n \n\nThe biological control involves many steps which are taken under\nconsideration for the increase in the number of predators & parasitoids.\n\n\nThey  include - -\n\n\n The mass rearing of economically important\nindividuals & their release.\n\n\nThe predators  are increased in the locality. \n\n \n\n\" Biological control \" is the safest of all the\ncontrol measures as it does not have any side effects.\n\n\nIt is a complete solution for a problem.\n\n\nIt is a slow process but a sure process.\n\n\nIt does not have any ill effects on the surroundings such as\npollution or residual effects etc.\n\n\nIt has no effect on the non-target species & it is one of the\nadvanced techniques which  is going to be \nused by removing other means of control. \n\n \n\n\" Biological control \" started with the control\nof scale insect on the citrus fruit in California & it was employed a\nbiocontrol method by bringing a predator of that scale  ( Icerya\npurchasi )  which was a lady bird beetle  ( Rhodalla Cardinalis )\n .\n\n\nThis was the first success in field of bio-control.  \n\n   \n\n\n Silver Fish - - \n\n \n\nThis is a household pest which belongs to creeping category.\n\n\nIt is a dorsoventrally flattened, scaly insect &  is elongated  which is found in the old books, store\nhouses where cellulose material is available in ample amounts.\n\n\nIt is world wide & is common in museums, libraries, stores etc.\n\n\nIt is responsible for  damaging of book bindings.\n\n\nIt feeds on the pasting material &  damages the\n valuable belongings.\n\n\nThe insect is a small creature & is thermophilus by nature.\n\n\nIt lives in cracks and crevices.\n\n\nIt shows a fusiform body with long antenna.\n\n\nBody is covered with  silvery scales.\n\n\nThe eyes are large.\n\n\nThere are long anal cerci & a unpaired median caudal filaments.\n\n\nThe insect is very agile &    belongs  \nto the ametabolus insects. \n\n \n\nThe insect damages the human belongings in the libraries & the\nmuseums.\n\n\nAs it feeds on the glue, add carbonic acid, acetic acid to the\nbinding substance during binding which will be effective for the control of\nthe insect.   \n\n\n Aphid - - \n\n \n\n\" Aphids \" are the tiny creatures which belong\nto the order  of  homoptera.\n\n\nThese are oval, small insects which show piercing & sucking type of\nmouth parts. \n\n \n\n\" Aphids \" are cosmopolian by distribution &\nare world wide.\n\n\nThey are the haxicious pest which are feeding on the cell sap of the\nplant.\n\n\nThey damage the plant  by pierciing their sharp\nstylets & suck the oozing cell sap.\n\n\nDue to  which the vigour of the plant is reduced.\n\n\nThey produce sooty moulds on the plant due to which the\nphotosynthetic activity of the plant is interfered.\n\n\nOther insects are attracted towards the plant & the plant is\ndamaged. \n\n \n\n\" Aphids \" are oval creatures with short\naristate antenna.\n\n\nThey are having bulging abdomen with two outgrowths on the dorsal\nside.\n\n\nThese are called the \" cornicles \" .\n\n\nThese are the peculiar character of aphids as chermids are  similar to aphids but they lack cornicles.\n\n\nAphids secrete honey dew like secretion which is collected by the\nants & in return they protect    themselves.  \n\n\nThese are associated with cow bugs.\n\n\nThey produce sooty moulds. \n\n \n\nAphids are polyphagous & are infesting  in a  variety of\nplants.\n\n\nThese individuals show polymorphic forms.\n\n\nThey reproduce by sexually as well as parthenogenetically.\n\n\nThe individuals migrate in summer & winter to summer & winter food\nplants. \n\n \n\n\" Aphids \" can be controlled by spraying 0.02 %\nmelathion or 0.05 % BHC.   \n\n\n Demerits of Chemical Control - - \n\n \n\nWhen the population of an individual causes damage 5 % above\n the level of economic damage  such individuals\nare called  \" pests \" .\n\n\nThese are to be controlled or they may damage human    beings   to such a extent that they create\nproblems.\n\n\nThey can be controlled by - - \n\n\n i) Chemical control ii) Biological control \n\n\nChemical control includes the use of chemicals & biological\ncontrol.\n\n\nIt employs the biological means  chemical\ncontrol shows many demerits  \n\n \n\nChemical control does not give a permanent solution to a problem\neven though it shows immediate effects. \n\n \n\nChemical controls    show   many\nside effects which can be studied under the residual effects, pollution, \n  interference   in other biological    ecocycles,   mutations, diseases. \n\n \n\nChemicals which are used during the control may have a long\nresidual period as they are not degraded biologically by the decomposers \nand  they remain in the environment. \n\n \n\nChemicals when  they  are retained in the environment\nthey    transfer   the other resources\nlike water bodies, soil, air which causes pollution.\n\n\nWhen these chemicals reach such    stages\n  or they pollute the surroundings    and \n produce ill effects on the living    beings. \n \n\n \n\n   When chemicals   pollute\nthe environment    then they   disturb the\nbiological ecocycles by interfering  with  the food chains.\n\n\nWhen such chemicals are absorbed by the plants, then the animals\nfeeding on these plants show ill effects. \n\n \n\nChemicals are found in the fat bodies of other individuals like\npenguins       milk etc.\n\n\nThese are found in the environment & enter our bodies & create\ndisorders.\n\n\nSometimes    they   cause genetic changes\n& mutations are caused due to which characters of individual changes.\n\n\n\" Chemical control \" leads to diseases in the\norganism which live in the environment. \n\n \n\nAs chemical control does not give permanent solution it must be\n replaced by some other effective & advanced methods to\navoid all   the  above problems.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ca55b446-3f37-4bef-8c04-3dff773a96a4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.074155+00:00"}

{"text": "8  \n\n \n\nThat night Ashok dreamt.\n\n\nHe was always a prolific dreamer, often going through several\nfull-length episodes in one night, and  Swamiji  had told him\nto watch his dreams, especially the vivid ones that are still remembered\nafter one wakes up.\n\n\nSuch dreams,  Swamiji  had said, give us clues into the\ntrue state of our inner life which the conscious mind very often suppresses.\n\n\nIt often needed the help of a skilled teacher to read the dream\nsymbols correctly, and Ashok had recorded and sent several of his dreams to\n Swamiji  who had returned them with his deeply perceptive\ncomments. \n\n \n\nIn the dreams that night in Pahalgam, with the sound of the Lidder\nflowing close by, Ashok found himself on the banks of a huge, untamed river.\n\n\nIt seemed to be flowing across a vast plain, and he came upon it\nwithout any warning as he was walking alone in some sort of a desert.\n\n\nHe looked around, but there was no sign of a bridge or boat.\n\n\nHe wondered how he was ever going to cross it, and he felt a sense of\npanic that he might be trapped there forever. \n\n \n\nSuddenly he saw two figures coming along the bank towards him,\none of them much larger than the other.\n\n\nThey were conversing deeply, and as they neared he found, to his\nsurprise, that they were Maharaj and Madan.\n\n\nHe could see Maharaj striding along in his ochre robe, his hair\nblowing up behind him, forming a sort of golden halo against the light.\n\n\nMadan was dressed in white, and moved with easy elegance alongside\n his master.\n\n\nThey walked past him as if he wasn't there, and though he tried to\ncall out to them no words escaped his lips. \n\n \n\nAs soon as they passed him, they disappeared.\n\n\nAshok was distraught.\n\n\nHe ran down along the bank of that huge torrent calling out to them\naloud, but they had vanished without a trace.\n\n\nAshok felt a sense of loss and sadness so deep that he threw himself\non the ground and broke into tears.\n\n\nThe moment he did this he felt something brush his back and, jumping\nup with a start, saw the great golden eagle that he had noticed at  `\nHarvan'  a few days earlier.\n\n\nThe eagle circled around him and flew off as if asking Ashok to\nfollow.\n\n\nAfter what seemed to be an interminable run stumbling through the\nstones and boulders that littered the river bank, Ashok suddenly saw what\nlooked like a narrow bridge of many-coloured lights-rather like a\nrainbow-going across the river in a great arc.\n\n\nMaharaj and Madan, continuing their conversation, were already half\nway across the bridge. \n\n \n\nBefore Ashok could follow them he heard a vehicle approaching,\nthrowing up clouds of dust as it neared.\n\n\nIt was a Land Rover; Ramesh was driving and Sheila was in the front\nseat, while in the back were a pair of labradors, one black and the other\nyellow.\n\n\nThey were evidently trying to say something to him, but their words\nmade no sense, as if they were speaking in some unknown tongue.\n\n\nAshok dropped the knapsack he was carrying, swiftly stripped until he\nwas entirely naked, and raced towards the bridge of light.\n\n\nIt was getting fainter.\n\n\nMaharaj and Madan had almost reached the other side.\n\n\nThe great bird dived past him as if urging him on.\n\n\nHe felt the chill of the water, heard the sound of the great river,\ncrash in his ears and, with all the strength left in him, jumped towards the\ndisappearing bridge. \n\n \n\n \" Wake up, Ashok, wake up.\" \n\n\nAshok heard the voice  as if coming out of\nanaesthesia.\n\n\nFor a moment he was not sure whether he was awake or asleep.\n\n\nThen he felt  hand ruffle his hair.\n\n\n \" Wake up!\n\n\nFor  sake,  the matter?\"  \n\n \n\nAshok shook his head and looked at his watch.\n\n\nIt was three in the morning. \n\n \n\n \" Ramesh, what are you doing here?\"  \n\n \n\n \" You were shouting so much in your sleep that we thought\nyou were dying or something.\n\n\n next door, and Sheils sent me to investigate.\n\n\nAre you sure  all right?\"  \n\n \n\n \" I <*> dotted lines</*>  sorry to have\ndisturbed you, Ramesh.\n\n\nI must have had one of my vivid dreams.\n\n\nReally,  quite all right.\n\n\nMany thanks for coming, though.\"  \n\n \n\nOn an impulse Ramesh bent down and kissed him on the forehead.\n\n\n \n\n \" Good night, Ashok,\"  he said.\n\n\nHe switched off the light as he went out. \n\n \n\nAshok lay back in his bed, touched by  gesture,\npondering over the dream he still vividly recalled.\n\n\nThe impact was quite clear to him even without    interpretation.\n\n\nHe had to shed entirely his present way of life and follow Maharaj\nif he was ever to cross the turbulent river of Time, flowing relentlessly and\neternally.\n\n\nHe would have to give up his job, his friends and his association\nwith Ramesh and Sheila.\n\n\nAnd he had to do it soon, or the bridge would disappear and he would\nbe left for God knows how many more lifetimes in the future. \n\n \n\nThey left for Srinagar at about ten, planning to get into the\nhotel by one.\n\n\nAshok needed one final meeting with Maharaj before he took the\nplunge, and hoped that he would be able to get away to the  Ashrama\n in the afternoon.\n\n\nAs if reading his mind, Ramesh cut in. \n\n \n\n \" This afternoon we are having high tea with the\nRustomjees.\n\n\nYou must come along, Ashok.\"   \n\n \n\n \" No, Ramesh, I have to go and see Maharaj.\n\n\nBesides, who are the Rustomijees?\n\n\nI don't even know them.\"  \n\n \n\n \" Don't know the Rustomjees, how is that possible?\"\n said Ramesh.\n\n\n \" They are an elderly Parsi couple who have become an\ninstitution in Srinagar.\n\n\n lived here for God knows how many decades, run a\nsort of departmental store that sells everything under the sun, and are such\ngood people that they have endeared themselves to Kashmiris and non-Kashmiris\nalike.\n\n\nMy father used to supply some goods to them and they became good\nfriends.\n\n\nI called them before we left Srinagar and they were delighted.\n\n\nThey saw me last when I was a teenager and are dying to see how I\nlook and how my wife looks.\"  \n\n \n\n \" OK.\n\n\nOK.\n\n\nYou two carry on, but please leave me out.\n\n\nI really have to see Maharaj.\"  \n\n \n\n \" Out of the question,\"  said Ramesh with an air\nof finality.\n\n\n \" You can go and see your precious Maharaj after tea.\"\n \n\n \n\nRamesh was sitting in the front of the taxi as he always liked\ndoing.\n\n\nAn excellent driver himself, he hated taking the back seat even if he\nwasn't driving.\n\n\nAshok looked helplessly at Sheila.\n\n\nRamesh caught his glance. \n\n \n\n \"  no use appealing to Sheila, Ashok.\n\n\nI must get you to meet the Rustomjees.\n\n\nThey are so sweet and such excellent company.\n\n\nHer English is a little wonky, but promise that you won't laugh at\nit.\"  \n\n \n\n \" All right,  come,\"  said Ashok,\n \" but I will have to leave soon after tea and get up to the \nAshrama  before it gets dark.\n\n\nWhat time is it?\"  \n\n \n\n \" Five  , and when Mr. Rustomjee says\nfive  exactly what he means.\"  \n\n \n\nAshok had a strange feeling of   deja vu \n , as if all this had happened before in a dream.\n\n\nPerhaps it was a premonition that in some way the Rustomjees were a\nsmall but vital part in his new life.\n\n\nWhatever it was, the  feeling persisted\nuntil they finally reached the hotel.\n\n\nAfter a quick but excellent buffet lunch Ashok excused himself and\nwent off to his room, promising to meet in the foyer at a quarter to five.\n\n\n \n\nRamesh looked at the retreating figure, then turned to Sheila.\n\n\n \n\n \" I really can't understand this guy,\"  he said,\n \" though  known him now ever since we were boys.\n\n\n his problem, why can't he stick to his job, get\nmarried and live happily ever after?\"  \n\n \n\n \" Happiness means different things to different\npeople, Ramesh.\n\n\nHe is evidently deeply committed to the spiritual quest, and\neverything else has become for him essentially meaningless.\"  \n\n \n\n \" Did he tell you that?\"  \n\n \n\n \" Yes, in so many words.\n\n\nHe also told me about the school incident, Ramesh.\n\n\nI managed with great difficulty to get it out of him.\n\n\nHe was very reluctant to speak of it.\"  \n\n \n\nRamesh was silent for a long while.\n\n\n \" What a terrible thing for me to do.\"  he said at\nlast.\n\n\n \" And I loved him more than I would have my own brother.\"\n \n\n \n\n \" Love and hate are both strong emotions, Ramesh, and\nthe dividing line between them is much thinner than we realise.\n\n\nIt was your very love for him that brought about such a violent\nreactiion.\"  \n\n \n\n \" Well, thank God  found \n\n\nI thought I would never see him again for the rest of my life.\n\n\nSheila, don't you think it was a fantastic coincidence that he was\non the same plane as us?\"  \n\n \n\n \" Yes, indeed,\"  said Sheila,  \" more\nfantastic than you can imagine.\" \n\n\nThe words were out of her mouth before she realised their\nimplication. \n\n \n\n \" And what do you mean by that?\"  \n\n \n\n \" Nothing except that we booked at the last moment and\nwere not sure of our seats till we got to the airport, remember?\" \n \n\n \n\n \" Of course.\n\n\nWell,  get a nap before we go off to the Rustomjees.\n\n\n really going to be fun.\"  \n\n \n\nThey reached the Rustomjee home exactly at five.\n\n\nThe taxi left them on the main road, from where they walked up to\nalong the Bund, the embankment along the Jhelum river that had over the years\nbecome the most fashionable shopping area in town.\n\n\nThey walked along for about two hundred yards passing hordes of\ntourists crossing the shops, until they came to a sign:  \"\nJ.Rustomjee: General Merchant\".  \n\n \n\n \" This is it,\"  said Ramesdh as he rang the\ndoorbell.\n\n\nIt was flung open and the Rustomjees were there to enfold them in\ntheir arms. \n\n \n\n \" Dear, dear boy, you look exactly like your father.\n\n\nDoesn't he, Shirin?\"  \n\n \n\n \" Yes, exactly,\"  said Mrs. Rustomjee, a\nvoluminous, comfortable woman in a Parsi  sari  .\n\n\n \" And this beautiful woman must be your bride.\" \n\n\n \n\n \" Yes, this is Sheila.\"  \n\n \n\n \" How beautiful, with a peaches and milk complexion.\"\n \n\n \n\n \" Cream,\"  said Mr. Rustomjee as they moved into\nthe living room.\n\n\nAshok was trailing behind. \n\n \n\n \" Oh Uncle and Aunty, this is my dear friend Ashok\nSingh.\n\n\nWe were at school together.\"  \n\n \n\n \" Welcome, welcome.\"  said Mr. Rustomjee.\n\n\n \" Did the three of you come up together then?\"  \n\n \n\n \" Yes,\"  laughed Ramesh.\n\n\n \" It was just a coincidence.\n\n\nWe ran into each other on the plane.\"  \n\n \n\nThey settled down in the roomy Kashmiri wicker sofas covered\nwith the famous local embrioidery.\n\n\nThe furniture and lamps were all Kahsmiri walnut, the carpets and\nlocal durries known as   namdahs   were a delight,\nand the shelves were full of Kashmiri silverwork and jade. \n\n \n\n \" What a beautiful room,\"  said Ashok.\n\n\n \" It looks almost like a Kashmiri emporium.\"  \n\n\n \n\n\" Thank you.\n\n\n been living here now since long before the three of\nyou were born, so we have collected a lot of Kahsmiri art objects.\n\n\nThey are such superb artisans.\n\n\nI must get Shirin to show you her collection of Kashmiri shawls one\nday.\n\n\nWe pack them up for the summer and open them in autumn.\" \n\n \n\nTea was served out of a large silver Kashmiri samovar.\n\n\nIt was delicious.\n\n\nAshok had never tasted anything like it before. \n\n \n\n \" This is the way tea should be prepared,\"  said\nMr. Rustomjee.\n\n\n \" No milk, only some saffron, almonds and sugar.\n\n\nWe use green tea, of course.\"  \n\n \n\nMrs. Rustomjee chattered away without a break.\n\n\nThe conversation turned to politics, and to a figure who was\nbecoming increasingly prominent in political life. \n\n \n\n \" I can't stand the man.\"  said Mrs. Rustomjee.\n\n\n \" He is not only a crook, but is mad as a hat.\" \n\n\n \n\n \" Hatter.\"  said Mr. Rustomjee. \n\n \n\n \" What do you mean,  ` hatter'? \n\n\n exactly what I said.\"  \n\n \n\n \" No, you didn't; you said he was mad as a hat.\"\n \n\n \n\n \" Well, hat or hatter, what difference does it make?\n\n\nHe is mad,  the point.\"  \n\n \n\n \" What do you think of his wife?\"  Sheila\ninterjected. \n\n \n\n \" Can't stand her too,\"  said Mrs. Rustomjee.\n\n\n \" She gets on my nerve.\"  \n\n \n\n \" Nerves,\"  said Mr. Rustomjee, looking to the\nheavens for help.\n\n \n\nAt this point a Kashmiri waiter came in with plates loaded with\npastries, sandwiches and a delicious local short bread known as  \nkulchas   .\n\n\nAs they began tucking in, the doorbell rang. \n\n \n\n \" That must be Akhilan,\"  said Mr. Rustomjee as\nhe made for the door. \n\n \n\n heart began beating so fast that he thought\neveryone could hear it.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a680c0b3-14df-41b0-8d90-ab60c7f76c04",

{"text": "CONCEPT AND STRATEGY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN INDIA  \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nThe significance of rural development for our country where 40 %\nof population lives below the poverty line cannot but be overemphasised.\n\n\nAs a matter of fact it has a socio-political aspect as well.\n\n\nSo the Government of India was committed for evolving a strategy that\nwould emeliorate the lot of 70 percent of our population living in rural\nareas.\n\n\nThis has been one of the most formidable and fundamental aspect of  development efforts. \n\n\n  CONCEPT OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT  \n\n \n\nThe concept of  ` rural development'  can be\nexplained in the context of agriculture and it remained, for a long time, \n  coterminus   with agricultural development\nin India    .  \n\n\n   The   Royal Commission on Agriculture (\n1928) gave the interpretation to rural development like this:\n\n\n \" We cannot too strongly state our conviction that the\ndirectorship of agricultural advance must in a very great degree depend upon\nthe suitability of the officer appointed.\"  \n\n \n\nAnother Committee after fifty years took a more or less similar\nview of rural development.\n\n\nIn 1972, the Planning  Task Force on Integrated\nRural Development observed that  \" After careful consideration, we\nhave belatedly decided to take what might be considered rather restricted\nview of the expression `  rural development'  we have chosen\nto equate it with agricultural development in the widest sense so as to\nembrace besides crop husbandary, all the allied activities.\"  \n\n\n \n\nThe concept of rural development, since the seventies has\nundergone a change and has become more comprehensive.\n\n\n\" The World Bank \" defines rural development as a\nstrategy desiged to improve the economic and social life of a specific group\nof people that is the rural poor.\n\n\nIt involves extending the benefits of development to the poorest\namong those who are living in the rural areas.\n\n\nThis group includes small-scale farmers, tenants and the landless.\n\n\nHere, it is appropriate to quote from the \" World Bank sector\npolicy paper \" which stated that  ` Rural\nDevelopment should include a mix of activities including projects\nto raise agricultural output, create new employment, improve health and\neducation, expand communications and improve housing'  .\n\n\nHence, it is wrong to equate rural development with agricultural\ndevelopment alone, although agriculture may be at the centre of the stage.\n\n\n\n  COMPONENTS OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY  \n\n \n\nA good policy designed to bring about the rural development\nshould incorporate the following components :\n\n\n1) The first component of such a policy should be  ` man'\n and his environment, which should aim at creating skills and\nknowledge so that man can exploit his environment and can expand his\nresources for both the better quality of his lilfe and the life of his\ncommunity by improving his family - - kinship life styles.\n\n\n2) The second important focus should be on the ecological setting\nsince rural is in contrast to urban and its development should have balanced\napproach to urban development. \n\n\n3) The third component of rural development should be the means of\nproduction and appropriate technology.\n\n\nAmong the factors of production the most important in the village\nsetting is land.\n\n\nThe exploitation of land to its maximum capacity will depend upon the\ntechnical know-how employed in terms of its production of different types of\ncrops water management resources, quality of seeds, application of the right\ntype of seeds, application of the right type of manure or fertilizer suitable\nto the soil conditions and other means like technology and labour force to\nirrigate and cultivate the land.\n\n\n4) The fourth component of rural development is the building of\ninstitution infrastructure essential for mobilising economic resources and\nthe organisation and management of men, money and material resources.\n\n\n5) Self-reliance is the fifth component of rural development and it\nis needed to be brought in through local initiative participation and\nmobilisation of exiting resources.\n\n\n6) The sixth and last component or rural development is the focus on\ndistributive justice in so far as the poor segments of the rural population\nare concerned. \n\n \n\nThus in formulating the rural development policy, the whole\napproach has to be fundamental and targeted towards alleviating the rural\npoor from the  ` culture of poverty'  which has been\nperpetuated over the ages.\n\n\nThe following chart disclose the various components of rural\ndevelopment.   \n\n \n\nThus, it may be said, agricultural development is a major part of\nrural development but that is not the total plan.\n\n\nRural development is a broader concept and is concerned with the\ntotal development of the rural economy as a whole.\n\n\nIt is a wholistic concept rather than a sequential one.\n\n\nSo it is equally concerned with the development of infrastructure\nlike \" roads, transport, power, insurance and banking, development of\ncottage industries, rural poverty, unemployment, encouraging traditional\ncrafts and industries and providing modern education, health facilities\n\" and providing cheap but decent houses for the rural poor and\ndeprived. \n\n \n\nThe concept of rural development is not a new one.\n\n\nIt has received the attention of  people like Gandhiji,\nTagore and others much before independence.\n\n\n \" Shantiniketan \" was perhaps the\nfirst systematic attempt in this direction.\n\n\nThe problem of rural reconstruction however was concretised by\nGandhiji.\n\n\nHe experienced the toil, drudgery and sub-human living conditions in\nvillages of India.\n\n\nHaving lived it Gandhiji knew for certain that unless and until the\nvillage economy of India was boosted,   `\nSwayaraja'  would be meaningless.\n\n\nThe soil of India, he said with agony and anguish lives in villages\nand  salvation lay in rural reconstruction.\n\n\nIt is not surprising, thus, to note that the new government\ndecided to give highest priority to agriculture and rural development\nprogrammes.\n\n\nThe dividing forces behind such a philosophy were a firm belief in\nthe humanistic ideology of Gandhiji and a very rational approach of\nincreasing agricultural productivity. \n\n\n  RURAL DEVELOPMENT DURING THE PLAN PERIODS  \n\n \n\nThen the government of India was committed to formulate various\nplan policies on rural development during the plan periods which are given\nbelow : PLAN POLICY I 1951-56 Community Development as method and national\nextension service as the agency. II 1956-61 Co-operating farming local\nparticipation. III 1961-66 Panchayat Raj three-tier model of democratic\ndecentralisation. IV 1969-74 Special clientele-based and area-based\nprogrammes. V 1974-79 Introduces the concept of  ` minimum needs'\n . VI 1980-85 Emphasis on strengthening the socio-economic\ninfrastructure in rural areas, alleviating rural poverty and reducing\nregional disparities.\n\n\nIntegrated Rural Development Programme. VII 1985-90 Emphasis on\ncreating new employment opportunities, special programmes for income\ngeneration through asset endowments, land reform participation of people at\ngross-roots level.  \n\n \n\nThe following are the various rural development programmes\nconceived and implemented in our country from time to time :\n\n\n1) Small Farmers Development Agency ( SFDA)\n\n\n2) Marginal Farmers Agricultural Labour ( MFAL)\n\n\n3) Drought Prone Area programme ( DPAP)\n\n\n4) Desert Development Programme ( DDP)\n\n\n5) Command Area Development Programme ( CADP)\n\n\n6) Tribal Area Programme ( TAP)\n\n\n7) Hill Area Programme ( HAP)\n\n\n8) Integrated Rural Development Programme ( IRDP)\n\n\n9) Training of Rural Youth for Self-Employment ( TRYSEM)\n\n\n10) Crash Programme for Rural Employment Programme.\n\n\n11) Pilot Intensive Rural Employment Programme.\n\n\n12) Food for Work programme\n\n\n13) National Rural Employment Programme ( NREP)\n\n\n14) Minimum Needs Programme\n\n\n15) Pilot Project on Government Centres\n\n\n16) 20-Point Programme\n\n\n17) Western Ghat Development Programme\n\n\n18) Special Programme for North-Eastern Region.\n\n\n19) Special Incentive Programme for the Industrially Backward Areas.\n\n\n20) Rural Labour Employment Guarantee Programme. \n\n \n\nThus the concept of rural developoment has been changing from\ntime to time and according to the need of  people, the\nGovernment has launched various rural development programmes.\n\n\nBut the government should see whether they have been implemented in\nfull.\n\n\nThen only  the condition of rural people will\nbe improved and the purpose for which the programmes were started, will be\nfulfilled.\n\n\nSo the government, policy framers and social reformers should focus\ntheir attention towards the welfare of 70 percent of our population who live\nin villages and seventy percent of the work force who depends on agriculture\nand alllied activities. \n\n \n\nThough the reasons for the rural development may be political in\nour country, it should be also approached with academic or human    considerations.  \n\n\nGenerally, it is said that India lives    in villages where   the pillars and builders of Nation live.\n\n\nFor their upliftment rural development is very essential.\n\n\nUnless rural economy is improved the indian economy will not be\nimproved to our    expectations.  \n\n\nSo the development of rural economy depends upon the extent on which\nthe rural development takes place in our country. <*> three stars in the\nmiddle of the line </*>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "aa0d0eb4-46e5-4e27-9625-19af340f26a4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.077505+00:00"}

Introduction  \n\n \n\nThe existence of a series of IV-VI compounds is one of the most\nexciting recent discoveries in the field of ferroelectric semiconductors.\n\n\nPbTe, a polar semiconductor of this class with cubic NaCl structure\nis a non-stoichiometric solid.\n\n\nSeveral studies are reported relating various aspects of PbTe [ 1-4 ] .\n\n\nHall effect measurements were studied by many workers [ 5-7 ] .\n\n\nRogers [ 8 ] and others have reported the results of mobility and\ncarrier concentration between room temperature and liquid nitrogen\ntemperature.\n\n\nBut sufficient data have not been reported regarding the growth and\nelectrical properties of PbTe bulk samples. \n\n \n\nThe metal-insulator-semiconductor ( MIS ) diodes, which are the\nmost useful devices in the study of semiconductor surfaces, have been studied\nby several workers [ 9, 10 ] .\n\n\nLily  et al  [ 11 ] reported some experimental results on\nMIS structures fabricated from ( 100 ) PbTe bulk single crystals at 77K.\n\n\nHowever, studies on MIS diodes made of PbTe bulk sample at room\ntemperature were not given much attention so far. \n\n \n\nIn the present investigation, an attempt has been made to study\nthe carrier transport properties in p-PbTe single crystal and laboratory\ngrown polycrystalline samples of n-type PbTe by the experimental measurements\nand theoretical analysis.\n\n\nTechnical details for fabricating Al-BaTiO3-PbTe( MIS )\nstructures and the first results of C-V characteristics at a fixed high\nfrequency of 1 MHz at room temperature are also reported.  \n\n\n  2. Experimental  \n\n\n  2.1 Charge growth and sample preparation :  \n\n \n\nFor charge growth, according to molecular weight composition of\nPbTe, the required quantities of elemental Pb and Te ( each of 5N purity )\nwere taken in a specially shaped clean quartz tube and the tube was vacum\nsealed.\n\n\nVacuum of the order of 10<*>minus</*>6 torr was produced by\na vacuum pumping system ( Hindhivac, model V.S.- 65 ) .\n\n\nThe ampoule containing the materials was heated in an electric\nfurnace at a temperature of 1000 <*> degrees</*>C for about 28 hours\ncontinuously.\n\n\nThe furnace temperature could be determined using a pt-pt / Rb\nthermocouple and a digital milivoltmeter ( AGRONIC 34A-4 model ) .\n\n\nThe furnace was cooled slowly.\n\n\nThe formed material was then cut into almost rectangular shape of\ndimensions 4.5 x 2.2 x 1.0 mm3 from the bowl with a microslicer - 2\nusing a very fine blade.\n\n\nThe samples were then ground with coarse and fine carborundum powder\nof grades 600, 800 and 1200 consecutively to obtain flat and parallel slides.\n\n\nThese were then first roughly polished on a polishing paper and then\nusing diamond compound ( Hifin fluid  ` OS'  ) on a smooth\npolishing cloth fixed to a rotating disc.\n\n\nThe  <- > smples   samples   were cleaned first\nwith 4 % hydrofluoric acid and then with acetone. \n\n\n2.2.   Optical and electrical properties :  \n\n \n\nPhilips diffractometer ( PW 1130 / 00 model ) with Bragg-Brentano\narrangement was used for XRD studies.\n\n\nFor conductivity and mobility measurements, Vander Pauw technique [\n12 ] was employed.\n\n\nPure Indium was used to make ohmic contacts on the samples.\n\n\nThe cryostat was of conventional design.\n\n\nA liquid nitrogen tall dewar was used to provide the desired\ntemperature to the specimen chamber.\n\n\nThe specimen temperature was varied from 77K to 300K by means of an\nelectronic temperature controller.\n\n\nThe thermometer used was a chromel-constantan thermocouple.\n\n\nA magnetic field of 5K Gauss was applied by a varian electromagnet (\nVarian, Fieldial Mark-II model ) .\n\n\nThe \" d.c. \" conductivity and Hall mobility were\nmeasured for both single crystal and polycrstalline samples at different\ntemperatures. \n\n\n2.3.   MOS capacitor :  \n\n\n2.3.1.   Fabrication :  \n\n \n\nA well polished slice of PbTe was cleaned by treating it first\nwith a solution of KOH, ethylene glycol and H2O2 ( 10 : 10\n: 1 ) and then by methanol.\n\n\nA layer of pure Indium provided the back ohmic contact.\n\n\nThe thin insulating oxide layer of BaTiO3 was deposited on\nthe semiconducting surface by RF sputtering using NM Nordiko 1500 RF\nsputtering system.\n\n\nThe top contact electrodes over the oxide layer were made by\nevaporating 99.99 % pure aluminium in circular shapes ( diameter <*>\napproximate- sign</*> 400 <*> mu</*>m ) using a copper mesh.\n\n\nA Hindhivac vacuum coating unit model No. 12A4 was employed for this\npurpose.\n\n\nAbout 8 electrodes were formed on the oxide layer.  \n\n\n2.3.2.   C-V measurements :  \n\n \n\nA three terminal measuring cell and an automatic C-V plotter (\nprinceton Applied Research model - 410 were used for measuring the\ncapacitance-voltage characteristics of Al-BaTiO3<*>minus</*><&> PbTe\nMOS device at room temperature.\n\n\nThe MOS behaviour was investigated by taking the retrace; of the\nsteady state high frequency C-V characteristics at a fixed frequency of 1\nMHz. \n\n\n  3. Results and discussions  \n\n \n\nThe XRD patterns of laboratory grown pellets are shown in Figure\n1.\n\n\nThe XRD pattern of a typical ( 002)- cut single crystal is also shown\nin the figure.\n\n\nIn figures, it can be noted that  \nthe peak at 2<*>theta</*> = 27.5<*>degrees</*> for single crystal is almost\nreproduced in the present grown sample at 2<*>theta</*> = 27<*>degrees</*>.\n\n\nThe slight difference in the value of 2<*>theta</*> reflactions for (\n002 ) may be attributed to the difference of stoichiometry in the two\nmaterials and the method of preparation.\n\n\nThe lattice constant calculated from the XRD data using the relations\nfor cubic crystals comes out to be <*> approximate-sign</*> 3.34A.    \n\n \n\nThe variation of mobility with temperature for PbTe single\ncrystal and laboratory grown crystal are shown in Figure 2.\n\n\nThe mobility decreases with increasing temperature for both the\nsamples.\n\n\nHowever, it can be noted that the curves in the figure exhibit two\ndistinct regions of low ( 77K-150K ) and high ( 150K-300K ) temperatures.\n\n\nThe rate of decrease of mobility is slower in lower temperature\nregion than that in higher temperature region.\n\n\nIn the low temperature region, the observed lincarity of curves\nclearly suggest that only one type of carriers contribute to the conduction\nprocess and the mobility corresponds to the light holes.\n\n\nThe steep fall of the mobility in the high temperature region in\ngeneral is attributed  to an increased contribution of heavy\nholes.\n\n\nAlso the overall nature of the curves for both the samples is similar\nexcept in the magnitude thereby, supporting the XRD data.\n\n\nThe calculated values of a are given in Table 1.\n\n\nThe results of single crystal sample is in close agreement with the\nreported values for the p-PbTe single crystal [ 13 ] , the observed\nvariations of resistivity with temperature are shown in Figure 3.\n\n\nThe values of carrier concentration   ` n'  \nusing the mobility and resistivity data are depicted in Figure 4.\n\n\nThe variation in   ` n'   clearly indicates a\nmonotonous decrease with decreasing temperature.\n\n\nThe corresponding calculated conductivities have been shown in Figure\n5.  \n\n \n\nIn order to investigate the temperature dependence of the\ndepletion capacitance in the inversion region for verifying whether it\nfollows any Curie law dependence, a series of MIS were fabricated.\n\n\nHowever, except for BaTiO3 which was RF sputtered on PbTe\nsubstrate at  room temperature, all other insulators\ninvestigated revealed very poor surface conductivity modulation property of\nthe base PbTe semiconductor due to their low resistivity and   probably presence of pin-holes.\n\n\nOne other major factor affecting these devices was the poor surface\nfinish of the PbTe sample.\n\n\nEfforts to decrease roughness of the sample have been   seriously limited by the technical limitation of our\nlab.\n\n\nThe conventional high frequency C-V behaviour for a capacitor with\nBaTiO3 layer is shown in Figure 6.\n\n\nThe measured    accumulation capacitance of 48.8 pF corresponds to the insulator\nBaTiO3 according to the conventional MOS theories [ 14 ] .\n\n\nThe calculated value of the dielectric constant for BaTiO3\nfilm <*> approximate-sign</*> 15 is in good agreement with reported values\nfor amorphous BaTiO3 films [ 11 ] . \n\n \n\nThe observed shift in the flat band voltage towards the negative\nvoltage region is commonly attributed towards a high percentage of interface\nstate density at the BaTiO3- PbTe junction and the increase of\ncapacitance beyond <*> plus</*>4 volts is probably due to sudden increase in\nthe conductance value of the film.\n\n\nThe results thus suggest that although the capacitance varies with\napplied voltage, the dielectric strength of BaTiO3 film is not\nenough to induce inversion in the underlying PbTe layer. \n\n \n\nReports of Lilly  et al  [ 11 ] and Moulin  et al\n [ 15 ] also reveal that MIS properties are strongly determined by\npreparation and fabrication techniques.\n\n\nThey also report that small capacitance changes are to be expected\nexperimentally and that insulator dielectric strength in excess of\n106 V cm-1 are required in order to obtain surface\npotential control.\n\n\nThe observed small change of capacitance is thus well supported and\nin agreement with the theoretical prediction. \n\n\n  4. Conclusion  \n\n \n\nPbTe polycrystalline samples were prepared by fusing Pb and Te in\nvacuum at 1000<*>degrees</*>C.\n\n\nThe XRD patterns of these samples though indicate a preferred\norientation along the ( 002 ) axis, these samples cannot be strictly\ncategorised as single crystals due to the obvious nature of the simple\ntechniques employed in growing them.\n\n\nHowever, the relative slow cooling ( <*> approximate-sign</*>\n10<*>degrees</*>C / hr ) employed in this case may have resulted in large\ndegree of reduction of its polycrystalline nature.\n\n\nAlmost similar behaviour of mobility and resistivity curves for both\nthe samples also suggests a near single crystal nature of the laboratory\ngrowth crystals. \n\n \n\nFor MIS studies, the present work reveals that probably higher\nthickness of the insulating film and better surface finish of PbTe may help\nin realizing these MOS capacitors and efforts are now being made in these\nlines to achieve better device quality. \n\n\n  Acknowledgments  \n\n \n\nAuthor is thankful to Prof A Mansingh and Dr T B S Rao for their\nhelp during the course of investigation. \n\n\n  References  \n\n\n [ 1] R S Allgaier 1961  \" J.

{"text": "NO MERIT IN CASTE   \n\n\n  Importance of Motivation  \n\n\n By A.K. ROY  \n\n \n\n CASTE has always cast a long shadow\nover Indian politics and the spectre that haunts the country is not that of\nclass struggle but of caste struggle.\n\n\n \" Backwards\"  and  \" Forwards\"  have\nbecome more meaningful today than Left and Right in politics, and some are\nplaying as  \" Centre-forward\"  against reservation, stoking\nthe fire and threatening the redivision of society. \n\n \n\nThe banks of both the Sabarmati and the Jamuna, carrying\nmemories of Gandhi and Nehru, are in flames, and with legislation to\nextend reservation for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for 10 more\nyears, the flame is spreading everywhere since increasing unemployment and\ndeclining job opportunities are becoming central factors.\n\n\nThough there is more noise in the north, the importance of caste\nwas more pointedly recognized in the south where in 1885, strangely\ncoinciding with the birth of the Indian National Congress, the then\nGovernment of Madras brought in the Grant in Aid code to provide special\neducational facilities to certain sections.  \n\n\n CASTE FACTOR \n\n \n\nAt the all-India level, the Montague Chelmsford reforms\nrecognized the caste factor and recommended some welfare measures for\ncertain depressed classes.\n\n\nThe 1935 Act later developed these into reservation for the Scheduled\nCastes and Tribes.\n\n\nAfter Independence more castes staked their claims for special\nfacilities and the term Other Backward Class came into existance. \n\n \n\nThough the recent legislation relates only to extending special\nquotas in Parliament and the Assemblies for 10 more years, the whole issue\nhas been raked up by the anti-reservation agitation.\n\n\nIt may be noted that though there is increased demand for\nreservation for the OBCs and for implementation of the recommendations\nof the Mandal Commission, even the original provision for such\nreservation is being challenged in the streets. \n\n \n\nCaste divisions within society are reflected in the Constitution\nas well.\n\n\nThough Articles 14, 15, 16 and 29 guarantee equal rights to all\ncitizens and forbid any discrimination on the basis of caste, religion,\nlanguage and sex, special provisions were made for certain castes by\nadding clause ( 4) both to Article 16 for the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and\nto Article 15 for the OBC.\n\n\nSince then Article 15(4) and 16(4) along with Article 45 of the\nDirective Principles, have become a charter of rights for the downtrodden.\n\n\n \n\nThe question of caste also kept the Supreme Court of India busy.\n\n\nIt was argued that clause ( 4) of Articles 15 and 16 had made the\nparent Articles meaningless and that special facilities should have no place\nin a modern democratic society.\n\n\nHowever, for the stark reality within society and also for the fact\nthat survival of the fittest is the law of the jungle, the Supreme Court had\nto alter its earlier judgement in the case of Balaji vs State of Mysore (\n1963) which did not recognize caste but maintained,  \" social\nbackwardness is in ultimate analysis the result of poverty to a very large\nextent\"  to lay down in 1965 in P. Rajendran vs State of Madras (\n1965) that  \" A caste is also a class of citizens and if the caste as\na whole is socially and educationally backward, reservation can be made in\nfavour of such caste within the meaning of Article 15(4).\"  \n\n \n\nAll political parties, whether backward or forward, face the same\nawkward situation in dealing with caste questions and cannot take a\nclear-cut stand without jeopardizing votes.\n\n\nThe Centre has already abdicated its responsibility after two\nexercises with the backward caste in the Kaka Kalelkar and Mandal\nCommissions, with a gap of 25 years between them.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, U.P.,\nMaharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Gujarat and Punjab are landed\nwith 15 commissions dealing with castes, other than the Scheduled Castes, and\nTribes and their entitlements, suggesting a mysterious quantum of\nfacilities. \n\n \n\nHowever, the question that baffles all is why it is that social\ndivisions are becoming sharper and sharper and more and more antagonistic day\nby day so that violence in the name of caste has become more frequent after\nIndependence than before.\n\n\nWhat is more, in the name of the discovery of India, there is a\ndiscovery of castes so that while the Kaka Kalelkar Commission ( 1955)\nmentioned 2,399 castes ( 839 being  \" most backward\"  ) ,\ninstead of decreasing the number in creased to nearly 4,000 by the time of\nthe Mandal Commission in 1980. \n\n \n\nWhy is the clock moving anticlockwise?\n\n\nIn the original Constitution the provision of reservation was\nmade for 10 years and Dr. Ambedkar expressed the hope that this would be\nsufficient for the Scheduled Castes and Tribes to shake off their\nhistorical backwardness and be at part with the rest.\n\n\nBut the reality remained different.\n\n\nIt is certain that reservations will be with us even in the 21st\ncentury. \n\n \n\nThe former Chief Justice of India, Mr. Chandrachud, has opined\nthat reservation should continue for 50 years more!\n\n\nSo what are the factors which make castes more and more relevant in\nour body politic?\n\n\nWhere does the defect in our democratic process lie? \n\n \n\nThe reason is simple.\n\n\nThis is because of the exploitative capitalist system we are creating\nin the name of nation-bulding.\n\n\nThe caste system not only indicates divisions within society but\nalso discrimination and disparity, and our so-called democratic\nprocess, because of its exploitative nature, instead of decreasing,\naccentuates the elements of discrimination and disparity within\nsociety, resurrecting with even greater vigour old problems in new form.\n\n\nWhile the Press and the elite give an impression that there has\nbeen enough of reservation and now it should end, statistics give a different\npicture. \n\n \n\nAccording to the Mandal Commission, the combined share of the\nScheduled Castes and Tribes in the class I and class II services of the\nCentral Government was 5.68 per cent and 18.18 per cent while that of the\nbackward classes was 4.69 per cent and 10.63 per cent, though the two groups\ncombined constitute more than 70 per cent of the population.\n\n\nOut of the total of 49 class I officers in the secretariat of the\nPresident only four were from the Scheduled Castes and Tribes, and none from\nthe OBC.\n\n\nIn the Prime  Secretariat only two out of 35\nclass I officers belonged to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes, and none to the\nOBC.\n\n\nAmong class II officers the number was slightly higher, but much\nbelow the reserved quota.  \n\n\n  HOME MINISTRY  \n\n \n\nWhat is interesting is that the Home Ministry, which is supposed\nto enforce reservation throughout the country, could not maintain reservation\nin its own secretariat.\n\n\nIn British India between 1882 and 1904 out of 16 ICS officers 15 were\nBrahmins.\n\n\nIn 1914 out of 118  munsifs  , 93 were Brahmins, and\nin 1944 out of 650 graduates 452 came from the same caste.\n\n\nOnly 10 Scheduled Castes and Tribes candidates could qualify on merit\nin the IAS and six in the IPS, between 1969 and 1978, there being none in\n1976 and 1977.\n\n\nThe proponents of meritocracy cannot explain how all the merit in\nthe country became hereditary within a small sect. \n\n \n\nThe problem is even more challenging beyond the world of\ngovernment officers.\n\n\nIn answer to questions in Parliament, the Government revealed that\nthe literacy percentages of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes in 1961, 1971 and\n1981 were 10.11 and 8.06, 14.54 and 10.89, and 21.38 and 16.35 respectively.\n\n\nThe literacy percentages for the general public in those same\nyears were 23.93, 29.48 and 36.23 i.e. the gap remained the same.\n\n\nThe picture is still more dismal for females.\n\n\nWhat is more, there is only a marginal difference in States like West\nBengal, Bihar and Orissa, whether ruled by the Congress or Janata or the\nLeft.\n\n\nSo that malady is connected with the nature of the system and not\nthe character of the government.  \n\n\n  POVERTY LINE  \n\n \n\nThe economic picture is even more depressing.\n\n\nIn 1977-78 the percentage of population below the poverty line in\nrural and urban areas was 57.82 and 44.98 in Bihar, 67.89 and 41.8 in\nOrissa, 58.31 and 34.5 in West Bengal and 57.2 and 38.4 at the all-India\nlevel.\n\n\nThe same percentage for the Scheduled Castes was 77.75 and 63.88 in\nBihar, 80.05 and 71.63 in Orissa, 70.75 and 54.50 in West Bengal, and 64.64\nand 54.25 at the all-India level, and for the Scheduled Tribes 68.20 and\n51.40 in Bihar, 86.38 and 70.90 in Orissa, 75.42 and 56.64 in West\nBengal and 72.93 and 52.59 nationally. \n\n \n\nIn 1983-84 - - the latest year for which figures are available -\n- the percentage below the poverty line in rural and urban areas in general\nwere 51.35 and 37.04 in Bihar, 44.76 and 29.29 in Orissa, 43.84 and 26.52 in\nWest Bengal, and 40.4 and 18.1 nationally.\n\n\nThe percentage for the Scheduled Castes was 71.1 and 52.2 in Bihar,\n54.9 and 40.3 in Orissa, 52.0 and 41.3 in West Bengal, and 53.1 and 40.4 at\nthe national level, and for the Scheduled Tribes, 64.9 and 39.8 in Bihar,\n60.9 and 52.0 in Orissa, 58.6 and 33.1 in West Bengal and 58.4 and 39.9\nnationally. \n\n \n\nAt this rate it will take the entire 21st century to wipe out\nthe percentage of the population below the poverty line and even longer to\nbridge the gap between the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and the general\npopulation so that a homogeneous Indian society in economic terms can\nemerge. \n\n \n\nThe argument of the upper castes that reservation diminishes\nefficiency is bogus as in that case  administration would\nhave been more efficient than that in Tamil Nadu.\n\n\nIn an underdeveloped country like India motivation is more\nimportant than  \" merit\"  , and the motivation to serve and\nwork is for more evident in the lower castes.\n\n\nWhether in the corridors of  Buildings in\nCalcutta or in the Gujarat Secretariat, 100 per cent of the loiterers during\nworking hours belong to the upper castes which also claim  \" merit\"\n . \n\n \n\nBut this does not mean that all is well with the present\nreservation policy.\n\n\nThere is substance in the argument that reservations and special\nfacilities have been monopolized by the few amongst the eligible groups\ncreating a class of neo-Brahmins within the Dalits.\n\n\nThey are worse than traditional Brahmins regarding their attitude\nto physical work and towards other Dalits.\n\n\nBut this is not because weightage has been given to the caste factor,\nbut because of the acquisitive values created by capitalism which has made\neven the provisions of the MRTP Acts useless in the economic sphere. \n\n \n\nReservation is nothing but a restriction on social monopoly and\nits misuse can easily be restricted, if not eliminated, by reserving\nthese facilities for one generation so that those who enjoy reservation\nonce should be considered  \" forward\"  .\n\n\nThis would make special facilities available to other members of\nthe same Scheduled Castes and Tribes, and strike at the very root of the new\nmonopoly.\n\n\nBut all these modifications can be contemplated only after the\noriginal provisions of reservation are honestly implemented, and a movement\nis launched for a long-awaited social resolution to end the existing\nexploitative system of which social discrimination is a part.  <*>\ntwo parallel lines, one bold and the other slim, above and below tantalizer\n</*> \n\n \n\n   WHILE   condemning the\nagitation against reservations, A.K. Roy, the Dhanbad M.P. suggests\nreforms ( such as restricting special facilities only to a single generation\namong the Scheduled Castes and Tribes) that might help in the creation of a\nhomogeneous Indian society. <it/>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b93b5d17-cfec-4c04-9a5c-73d948b79c2e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.079653+00:00"}
{"text": "ONE  \n\n\n February 11, 1988  \n\n \n\n THE  early morning breeze blowing from across the  \nborder was brisk and sprayed with the aroma of harvest-ready grain; some  \nalready harvested. \n\n\nThe night was cool and painful. \n\n\nThe darkness, dissolving into the opaque screen of distant day break,  \nwas fearful and uncertain.  \n\n \n\nThe Maruti Gypsy, with a canvas top, was clambering listlessly  \ntowards Khemkaran from Tarn Taran-Patti side. \n\n\nThe stillness of the surroundings was disturbed by the neighing of  \nstray horses, tail beating sounds of buffaloes and the tired and reluctant  \nbarking of scared stray dogs.  \n\n \n\nThe dogs were killed systematically by police and para military  \nforces, as well as by the militants. \n\n\nDogs cannot be discreet, shout they must at the slightest sound of  \nstrange movements. \n\n\nPatrols, pickets, ambushes by police and para military forces were  \nfavourite targets of these dogs. \n\n\nSome  jawans  ( constables) and terrorists  \npracticed target shooting whenever a dog was sighted. \n\n\nPet owners were strictly warned to keep their dogs indoors and  \nchained.  \n\n \n\nThe stillness was also disturbed by crackling of the  \nradio-telephone set, bursting to life once in a while, carrying  \ninstructions to patrol and ambush parties.  \n\n \n\nAnother Jeep following the Maruti, was occupied by eight CRPF (  \nCentral Reserve Police Force ) constables and a Sub-Inspector.  \n\n \n\nHis voice came alive in the radio-set of the Maruti.  \n\n \n\n \" Zulu, this is Tango - - How far do we go?\"   \n \n\n \n\nZulu, that is Harkirat Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police,  \nsmoking away a costly brand of cigarette, gulped down some whisky from a  \nquarter bottle, licked his lips and picked up the phone almost disdainfully.  \n \n\n \n\n \" Tango, follow me another three kms near the border  \npost\".   \n\n \n\nThough a Sikh, Harkirat could not give up smoking, a habit he had  \nacquired as a student. \n\n\nHis father was an  Amritdhari  , the one who had been  \nbaptised and tasted the divine nectar. \n\n\nThe entire family was highly religious. \n\n\nHis wife, Sampuran was an exceptionally pious lady. \n\n\nTill a few months back, she used to visit the Harimandir ( the Golden  \nTemple) almost daily. \n\n\nNow, the  Gurudwara  was occupied by militants and  \nsurrounded by  police and security forces.  \n\n \n\nAnother sound which was intermittently disturbing the peace of  \nHarkirat and the armed constables was the muffled, broken and nagging cries  \nof Surjit, his hands tied at the back, legs tide like that of a turtle and  \neyes and mouth bound by a piece of blood soaked saffron cloth. \n\n\nSurjit Singh Dalla could now only moan. \n\n\nHe was lying on the modified back floor of the vehicle. \n\n\nAny movement instantly invited a hit of rifle butt on his buttock and  \nshoulder. \n\n\nSurjit was scared to move.  \n\n \n\n \" Tango, Zulu here. \n\n\nWe stop now. \n\n\nGive cover firing to my party, take position behind  sarkanda  \n ( elephant grass) bushes. \n\n\nMy party will proceed with the Cat ( a militant used as a guide)  \ntowards the BOP ( Border Observation Post)\".  \n\n\n instructions were sharp and crisp.  \n\n \n\n \" Roger Sir\".   \n\n \n\nThe Maruti lumbered along a dirt road for another furlong and  \nstopped. \n\n\nHarkirat jumped out, followed by four constables.  \n\n \n\nHe stood facing west towards the Pakistan border, about two  \nfurlongs away, covered by high-grown elephant grass, across a deep ditch with  \nhigh earthen banks, locally known as Dhosi bund; in practice, part of defence  \nmechanism of the country. \n\n\nHarkirat lit another cigarette, looked at his watch - - three-thirty  \na.m. \n\n\nThere was no glow of sun-rise in the east. \n\n\nThe day which went down the horizon barely eight hours ago was still  \nwrapped up like a dead body.  \n\n \n\nHarkirat put his hands on his waist, bent backward, did a few  \nsideways movements and ordered in a gruffy voice,  \" Malkiat, bring  \nthe bastard out\".   \n\n \n\nMalkiat aligned his Self Loading Rifle ( SLR) in a forward  \nassault position and approached the crouched body of Surjit. \n\n\nHe was not sure if it was safe to go near. \n\n\nPointing the rifle nozzle towards the robust, haggard and  \nblood-splattered mutilated body, Malkiat grumbled  \" Fucking idiots,  \nGod knows from where these insects come\".  \n\n\nHe untied the hands and feet of Surjit.  \n\n \n\n \" Come down you bastard\"  Malkiat sounded tired  \nbut furious. \n\n\nHe also sounded impatient,  \" Could not sleep the whole night  \nfor you, dog\".  \n\n\nHis words were soon followed by two kicks.  \n\n \n\nMalkiat and Ram Prakash, another burly-looking but kidfaced  \nconstable, straddled up Surjit next to the Maruti. \n\n\nOpening his eyes, Surjit could not even see the policemen standing  \nnext to him. \n\n\nHis eyes had been tied for more than four hours.  \n\n\nThey were bursting out in pain, accompanied by a rhythmic throbbing  \nat the temples and eye-balls. \n\n\nHe could perceive only a fleeting rush of different colours, followed  \nby darkness.  \n\n \n\nHe tried to stand on his legs. \n\n\nHis trousers were torn at several patches, and the rest of his torso  \nwas oily and smudged with blood. \n\n\nBlack driplets of bloods were frozen around his nostrils and edges of  \nlips. \n\n\nThough in pain, he inhaled the February chill deeply.  \n\n \n\nSurjit looked up at Harkirat and the other policemen. \n\n\nHe managed to put together a few words,  \" Sir, spare me. \n\n\nMy father is also dead. \n\n\nWe have no other male member in the family\".   \n\n\n \" Fuck your mother\",  Harkirat mumbled tersely. \n\n\n \" Sir, I will give you money. \n\n\nWe will sell the land and give whatever we can\",  Surjit  \npleaded. \n\n \n\n \" It is too late. \n\n\nYou ungrateful stupid. \n\n\nYou had the guts of your blighted mother to complain against us to  \nthe Governor. \n\n\nWhat did your fucking father think himself to be! \n\n\nHere I am the master. \n\n\nThings will happen as I say. \n\n\nYou do not live in the forest and fight with the tiger too\".   \n \n\n \n\nHarkirat lit another cigarette, inhaled a lungful of smoke, and  \nexhaled in a relaxed manner. \n\n\nHe took out a loaded AK 47 from inside the Maruti, cocked it and  \nordered the constables to take position.  \n\n \n\nMalkiat, Har Prakash and two others instinctively took to the  \nground in lying position, cocking their SLRs. \n\n\nHarkirat picked up the radio telephone mouth-piece and spoke in a  \nhushed voice,  \" Zulu to Tango - - do you get me?\"   \n\n \n\n \" Zulu, Tango here. \n\n\nI am getting you O.K\".   \n\n \n\n \" I am going to BOP with the Cat. \n\n\nI am expecting a group coming in from Pakistan. \n\n\nDon't open fire till you hear my two whistles\".   \n\n \n\nHarkirat hung up the mouth piece, switched off the radio and  \ngrabbed Surjit by the hair.  \n\n \n\n \" Go ahead of me and run when I say. \n\n\nOnly that way you can save your life\",  Harkirat smiled  \ndevilishly.  \n\n \n\n \" Sir, spare my life\",  Surjit again pleaded.  \n \n\n \n\n \" I am not going to kill you. \n\n\nI am giving you a chance, run when I say\",  Harkirat  \nimpatiently tossed the AK 47 from his left palm to right.  \n\n \n\nSurjit looked towards Harkirat. \n\n\nThe eastern horizon was slightly glowing up. \n\n\nArrows of very indistinct purple light were trying to pierce the low  \ncloud covers. \n\n\nA new dawn could perhaps bring new hope. \n\n\nSurjit looked towards the arrows of  light  \nthrough half closed eyelids.  \n\n \n\nHarkirat turned  face towards the Pakistan  \nborder and snapped  \" Go and run when I say\".   \n\n \n\nSurjit tried to walk, but limped. \n\n\nHe felt a kind of electric current running from his head to his lower  \nlimbs. \n\n\nHis temple started throbbing again, his heart pounding away loudly  \nlike a rice-shelling mill. \n\n\nAs he tried to move, images of his mother, father and sister Lajo  \nstarted appearing before his eyes. \n\n\nHe remembered Swapna as well, the daughter of a Hindu civil servant,  \nstudying in the same course as him at Hindu College, Delhi. \n\n\nHe liked Swapna and dreamt of marrying her one day. \n\n\nProbably she also liked him.  \n\n \n\n \" Run, you son of a bitch, run, run, run\",   \nHarkirat started shouting. \n\n\n reflexes failed. \n\n\nHis legs did not move. \n\n\nHis whole body froze, as if it was a half-done statue in battered  \nrock.  \n\n \n\nHarkirat emptied the AK 47 magazine, firing a few shots at  \nSurjit and scattering the others aimlessly. \n\n\nHe was too drunk to fire straight. \n\n\nHe prostrated himself on the ground a few feet away from the  \nslithering body of Surjit and blew a whistle twice. \n\n\nHell descended suddenly. \n\n\nThe opaque darkness was pierced by bullets flying from different  \ndirections.  \n\n \n\nThe BSF ( Border Security Force) observation post, about a  \nkilometer towards the north, also opened Light Machine Gun ( LMG) fire,  \npunctuated by tracer bullets. \n\n\nFlashes from the tracers added an errie glow to the ghastly  \nscenario. \n\n\nAbout 2 kms to the west, the Pakistani  post also  \nstarted firing LMG bursts towards the Indian BOP. \n\n\nThe madness continued for about ten minutes.  \n\n \n\nSurjit was hit twice, bullets piercing his leg and thigh  \nmuscles. \n\n\nNobody heard him, but, if the earth and dust could record his voice,  \nthe replay would have sounded   \" Wahe Guru\"   . \n\n\nSurjit lapsed into coma, bleeding profusely.  \n\n \n\nHarkirat waited for three minutes, stood up, looked at the body  \nof Surjit, kicked it and went to the Maruti in a crouching position. \n\n\nAfter switching on the radio set he shouted,  \" Zulu here,  \nTango, do you get me?\"   \n\n \n\nAfter a brief silence, Tango came on air,  \" Yes, Sir. \n\n\nIs the operation successful?\"   \n\n  \" No  Yaar  . \n\n\nThe Cat was a rogue. \n\n\nHe started running towards the Pak border. \n\n\nHis friends were hiding behind  sarkanda  . \n\n\nThey opened fire first. \n\n\nDid you see the firing from our BOP and from the Pak Rangers? \n\n\nAnyway, come here. \n\n\nWe have to make a quick  move, before the  \nPakis open fire again\".  \n\n\nHarkirat sat down on the ground, lit another cigarette, and looked  \nat his wrist watch. \n\n\nIt was about four thirty.  \n\n \n\n \" Go and pick up the empties\",  Harkirat  \ncommanded his constables.  \n\n \n\nThe CRPF Sub-Inspector turned up with his men, saluted Harkirat  \nand waited for orders.  \n\n \n\n \" Back to Malmandi\",  he ordered the contingent  \nand took the wheels.  \n\n \n\nThe eastern horizon was now becoming purple and momentarily  \nglowing like pale blood splashed on a steel-grey mat. \n\n\nThe low cloud covers were now painted in a riot of colours. \n\n\nMomentarily, a light golden hue appeared, followed by dusky dimness,  \nas another cloud cover obstructed the rays.  \n\n \n\nHarkirat took another sip of whisky, rinsed and spat out. \n\n\nHe changed the frequency of his radio set and spoke in chaste  \nPunjabi, reporting to his detachment headquarters,  \" Zulu here,  \nreporting to Tiger\".   \n\n \n\n \" Tiger here, I am getting you four\".   \n\n \n\n \" Sir, I am to report an encounter. \n\n\nTwo kms inside our territory near BOP, one terrorist suspected  \nkilled or injured. \n\n\nHe may have crossed over to Pakistan. \n\n\nOne AK 47 recovered. \n\n\nTerrorists opened fire from Pak side. \n\n\nPak Rangers opened covering fire to help them. \n\n\nOur BSF, I feel, also opened fire\".   \n\n \n\n \" Any detail?\"   \n\n  \" Shall report at zero nine hundered hours. \n\n\nSir. \n\n\nPlease inform I.G.  Saab  . \n\n\nRecommend a medal for me and my boys\".  \n\n\nHarkirat sounded very pleased.  \n\n \n\n \" O.K. Roger. \n\n\nWe will talk tomorrow\",  Tiger switched off.  \n\n \n\nBy the time the Maruti and the Jeep started racing towards their  \nbase, lilting tunes of very early morning prayer songs started flowing from  \nsurrounding village  Gurdwaras  . \n\n\nA particular  Shabad  in  Malhar  ,  \nin praise of the  Akal Purakh  ( God Almighty) filled the air:  \n \" O Gobind, O Gopal, O my love, my God. \n\n\nO sustenance of my vital-breath, the friend of the supportless, rid  \nme the poor one, of my pain.\"   <*> star </*> <*> star </*> <*>  \nstar </*> \n\n \n\nSurjit is not the hero of this story. \n\n\nHe was never a hero-type. \n\n\nSon of a Junior Commissioned Army Officer, Dalbir Singh Dalla, a  \n jat  by caste, Surjit, a six feet four-inches tall, robust,  \nhandsome, beautiful Aryan-looking young man of nineteen, never considered  \nhimself a hero. \n\n\nA young  jat  Sikh from the rural background of Mandi  \nTalwandi village, he was brought  up by his mother,  \nSatkar Kaur almost as a misfit.  \n\n \n\nComing from the family of a junior civil servant of Ludhiana,  \nSatkar was forced to adapt to rural life after her marriage. \n\n\nA graduate in History, Satkar Kaur was married off to an army sepoy  \nat the age of twenty one by her step-mother, soon after the death of her  \nfather, Rajdev, in an accident.  \n\n \n\nA diabetic, Rajdev Singh Grewal, a Junior Engineer in Canal  \nDepartment, had gone off to his village Kotli for harvesting wheat, locally  \nknown as  kanak  , literally meaning gold. \n\n\nGold surely wheat is to a Punjabi. \n\n\nAgriculture is the life force of rural  jat  Sikhs  \nand harvesting of  kanak  is the culmination of year-long hard  \nwork. \n\n\n Kanak  is grown not by mere combination of  \nagro-technological factors; it is grown with the ingredients of sweat,  \nblood, feud, village rivalry, murder, court cases and, above all, lots of  \ndreams.  \n\n \n\nRajdev died following the amputation of two hands in an  \nimprovised thresher machine, common in Punjab. \n\n\nA diabetic patient, Rajdev developed gangrene and never recovered.  \n \n\n Rajdev could never keep himself away from harvesting wheat. \n\n\nHe was proud of the production of a special variety of   \nBasmati  in his village farm. \n\n\nThe last three monsoons had favoured him and he expected a bumper  \ncrop that year as well. \n\n\nBut, that particular year, he was not lucky. \n\n\nThis happened around 1966, after the fifth year of his second  \nmarriage, and exactly on the death anniversary of his first wife, Swaran  \nKaur, mother of Satkar.  \n\n \n\nSwaran Kaur and Satkar were really not considered lucky for the  \nfamily, as the first child was a girl. \n\n\nBut Rajdev had to live with it. \n\n\n mother had brought some land as dowry. \n\n\nThe daughter of a village school teacher, she struggled with Rajdev  \nfor ensuring proper education for Satkar. \n\n\nRajdev was afraid of her personality. \n\n\nShe gave all the pleasures of life to him, but saw to it that he  \nnever came home drunk, sat at least twice a day before the Granth Sahibi and  \nsaid his prayers. \n\n\nRajdev loved and admired her, but was afraid. \n\n\nHe expected a male child from her and Swaran did die on the  \noperation table, while giving pre-mature birth to a still-born male baby.  \n \n\n Rajdev was quickly married off to Nirmal Kaur, daughter of a contractor. \n\n\nShe brought dowry of five  acres  of irrigated land. \n\n\nFond of good living. \n\n\nNirmal Kaur fixed her goals with meticulous sighting. \n\n\nNot only did Rajdev start coming home drunk, he started inviting  \nfriends for a few drinks. \n\n\nA  jat  , as Nirmal Kaur learnt at her contractor  house, was good  for nothing, if he did  \nnot have a few drinks with chicken  tikkas  ( roasted chicken  \nnuggets), and a few extra-marital flings.  \n\n Rajdev was happy to have two male children, sure not only of succession,  \nbut dreaming of expanding his land holdings in the coming years. \n\n\nAfter all, he had two inheritors to take care of the land.  \n\n \n\nNirmal married off Satkar as soon as she passed her B.A. with  \nHonors in History, to Sepoy Dalbir Singh Dalla; whose family had migrated to  \nMandi Talwandi from Dera Ghazi Khan, after Partition. \n\n\nSon of a Border Ranger in North West Frontier Province, Dalbir  \ncombined in him the dual characterstics of a  jat  , love for  \nuniform and land.  \n\n \n\nSatkar was disillusioned with her married life. \n\n\nDalbir, mostly out on posting to fronts and other stations, left her  \nalone to take care of his landed property, buffaloes, tractor and two  \nchildren. \n\n\nSurjit and his lovely sister Lajo, formally christened Amrita. \n\n\nAn educated woman, Satkar initially toyed with the idea of teaching  \nin a local school. \n\n\nSocially there was no problem, but, like a tree encircled by  \ncreepers and vines, she preferred to hold on to  family, as  \na good wife, mother and family guardian.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "76e9654c-657e-4317-b1fb-0a0a197f33d3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.080800+00:00"}
{"text": "PHYTOTOXIC EFFECTS OF PESTICIDES ON POLLEN   \n\n\nR.C. GUPTA and M.U. BEG\n\n\n Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, Post Box No.80, Mahatma\nGandhi Marg, Lucknow-226 001, India\n\n\n( Received October 9, 1989; Revised December 31, 1990 ) \n\n\n Key words :  \" Pesticides \" , \"\nphytoxitcity \" , \" pollen \" \n\n\nABSTRACT\n\n \n\nThis report provides an account on phytotoxic effects of\npesticides on pollen viability, germination and growth.\n\n\nPollen were damaged and had reduced viability, germination and growth\non exposure to pesticides.\n\n\nThe mechanism of inhibition of pollen germination and tube growth are\ndiscussed.    \n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nDevelopment and activity of pollen are among the more sensitive\nindicators of adverse factors in environment.\n\n\nThis led to the idea that the inhibited development and growth\npotential of pollen grains can provide a convenient test system of monitoring\natmospheric pollutants ( Masaru et al., 1976; Pfahler, 1981; Mascarenhas,\n1981; Varshney & Varshney, 1981 ) .\n\n\nHowever, scattered studies are available on the effects of\npesticides on pollen ( Shawa et al., 1966; Eaton & Chen, 1969; Gentile et\nal., 1971, 1973; Dubey & Mall, 1972; Dubey, 1977; Dubey et al., 1984;\nSoundarajan, 1984; Gupta & Khanna, 1981; Gupta & Beg, 1988; Bhardwaj et al.,\n1989 ) , therefore, the present work was designated to provide an account of\npollen production and germination under the stress of pestcides.  \n\n\n MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n \n\nSeeds of green gram PS-7 procured from Chandra Shekhar Azad\nAgricultural University, Kanpur, were sown about 2 cm deep in the\nexperimental plots.\n\n\nThe plot size for each spray was 1.5 m2 and randomized block\ndesign was used.\n\n\nEndosulfan, a broad spectrum organochlorine insecticide of the\ncyclodiene group manufactured by Excel Industries Ltd., Bombay under the\ntrade name Endocel-EC 35 was diluted so as to give a water suspension of 100,\n500, 1000, 10,000 ppm concentrations.\n\n\nTwo foliar spray were done with the help of Aspee hand operating\nsprayer at 3rd leaf stage and flowering stage of the crop. \n\n \n\nKapoor & Nair ( 1974 ) method was followed for studying the\npollen production capacity and staining with 1 % acetocarmine was used to\ndetermine pollen viability.\n\n\nPollen germination and tube growth was recorded by sowing pollen\ngrains on sterilized cavity slide in a drop of basal culture media.\n\n\nPrepared slides were later incubated in petri plates lined with moist\nfilter paper for 4 h at room temperature of 22-23 <*> degree</*> C and\nrelative  humidity of 49-70 % under diffuse light.\n\n\nAfter incubation, the pollen cultures were scanned under light\nmicroscopes in ten fields ( 15 x 10 magnification ) to determine the\npercentage of pollen germination and to measure the tube length by calibrated\nocular micrometer.  \n\n\n RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\n ( a)  Pollen production  : \n\n\nPollens are much more abundantly produced in anemophilous species\nthan in entomophilous species while hydrophilous species produced very scanty\npollen grains per plant.\n\n\nStudies on pollen production capacity in pesticides treated plants\nwere not reported in the literature.\n\n\nHowever, our studies of both long and short stamens of  Vigna\nradiata  on exposure to endosulfan have shown reduction in the pollen\nproduction.\n\n\nThe pollen produced by long and short stamens were reduced to an\nextent of 23 and 19 percent at 500 ppm, 43 and 50 % at 1000 ppm and 82 and 66\npercent at 10,000 ppm dose levels of endosulfan ( Table 1 ) .\n\n\nThese results provide an examples of adverse effect of pesticides on\npollen production in the field crops and so it is important to evaluate the\neffect of pesticidal chemicals on different crops to single out the\nsusceptible species. \n\n \n\n ( b)  Pollen viability  : \n\n\nThe pollen viability from control and endosulfan treated mungbean\nplants was observed and it was found that the viability of pollen was\nmarkedly reduced in long stamens. \n\n \n\n ( c)  Pollen germination and tube elongation  : \n\n\nStudies on the effects of commercial formulation of pesticides in\ngeneral, showed that the pollen were damaged by vapour of pesticides.\n\n\nDubey & Mall ( 1972 )    reported that the percentage of germination of viable pollen in\nbrinjal was reduced to 56 % on treatment with 1000 ppm of 2, 4-D, Soundarajan\n( 1984 ) studied the effect of dimenthoate, fenevelorate, phosalone, methyl\ndemeton and endosulfan on pollen germination in okra and egg plant and\nobserved that the maximum drop in percentage germination was with endosulfan\nand minimum with dimethoate.\n\n\nIn strawberry, captan inhibited pollen germination  in vitro\n or when sprayed on anthers after dehiscence ( Daton & Chen, 1969 ) .\n\n\nGentil et al. ( 1971, 1973, 1978 ) tested  in vitro  32\ncommercial formulations of fungicides and insecticides for pollen\ngermination and tube growth to various degrees while topical application\nof naled 58 % EC, formulated at 1000 ppm actual material, totally inhibited\nthe germination.\n\n\nFurther, seven applications of carbaryl or gardona to the silk of\nsweet corn at 24 h interval cause a high incidence of malformed or missing\nkernels.\n\n\nHowever, abnormalities of lesser degree were observed with fewer\napplication.\n\n\nWe also observed that there was a drop in percentage germination and\ntube growth of pollen with increase in concentration of endosulfan in \n Catharanthus roseus, Vigna radiata, Trigonella foenum-graecum and\nBrassica campestris  .  \n\n \n\nThe degree of inhibition was more severe in pollen tube growth\nthan in germination ( Gupta & Beg, 1988 ) .\n\n\nThis observation supports the view that pollen germination and\ntube growth are independent processes governed by separate set of conditions\nand of the two, activation phase of pollen germination was less sensitive\nto endosulfan.\n\n\nHowever, the mechanism of inhibition of pollen germination and tube\nelongation is not clear at the moment but by equating with some of the known\nphytotoxic effect of endosulfan on seed germination and seedling growth, a\nplausible explanation may be offered.\n\n\nPesticide endosulfan is known to alter membrane permeability, cell\nelongation and biosynthesis of protein and polysaccharide and so they may\nbe responsible for the inhibition in pollen germination and tube elongation\ndue to pesticides. \n\n \n\n ( d)  Effect on yield  : \n\n\nShawa et al. ( 1966 ) studied the effect of commercial preparation of\nfour fungicides - - Captan, ferbam, maneb and phaltan on crnaberry pollen\ngermination, fruit set and yield and reported maximum reduction of yield in\ncase of phaltan followed by captan, maneb and ferbam. \n\n \n\n ( e)  Surfactants and pollen  : \n\n\nSurfactants are in variably incorporated in preparations of\npesticides to enhance penetration, retention time and effectiveness.\n\n\nShivanna ( 1972 ) studied the effect of two non-ionic surfactants,\nTween-80 and Triton-100 on pollen grains of  Trigonella foenum-graecum\n .\n\n\nThe former did not effect  in vitro  germination and tube\ngrowth, while the later drastically reduced both of these processes.\n\n\nGentile et al. ( 1973 ) also observed strong inhibition in pollen\ngermination and tube growth in sweet corn treated with Trichlorfon-Dupont and\nTrichlorfon multifilm-77 combination.\n\n\nPfahler et al. ( 1979 ) studied the effect of commercial\nsticker-spreader Tween 80 and 114 individually in various concentrations on\n in vitro  pollen germination and tube elongation in three\ngenotypes of maize.\n\n\nIncreasing concentrations of Tween-80 had the least  effect on pollen germination and tube growth while 114 had the\nmaximum effect.\n\n\nThere was no germination when 114 was used above 10 mgl-1.\n \n\n\n ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\n \n\nThe authors thank Dr. P.K.

DASGUPTA\n\n\n Department of Physiology, University College of Science,\nUniversity of Calcutta, 92, Acharya Prafullachandra Road, Calcutta-700 009,\nIndia \n\n\n( Received June 20, 1990; Revised January 2, 1991 ) .\n\n\n Key words :  \" Acid phosphatase ( ACP ) \"\n, \" alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) \" , \" male toad\n\" \n\n\nABSTRACT\n\n \n\nAcid and alkaline phosphatase activities were estimated in\nplasma, liver, kidney and testis after installation of Dimethoate for a\nperiod of seven days on male toad.\n\n\nACP activity increased in plasma and kidney but decreased in liver\nand testis.\n\n\nOn the other hand ALP activity increased in liver and testis but\ndecreased in plasma and kidney.\n\n\nAlteration of enzyme activities indicates that long exposure of this\nsystematic pesticide affects function of liver, kidney and testis.    \n\n\n INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nPesticides are widely used for control of pests.\n\n\nThis technique definitely helps to save crops against pest\ninfestation but a formidable possibility of biosphere pollution develops\nleading to calamitous effects on non-target flora and fauna of various\necosystems ( Warren, 1981 ) .  \n\n \n\nToad (   Bufo melanostictus   ) , an\nanuran amphibia is a common animal in pond, lake, fields, etc. that plays a\nvery important role in biocontrol of pests in natural environment.\n\n\nTadpoles and toads destroy a large number of mosquito larvae and\nother harmful aquatic insects.\n\n\nOn land, also, toads are active all day eating insects, many of which\nare crop pest ( Atwal, 1986 ) .\n\n\nBut such an important natural scavenger is continuously exposed to\ndifferent toxic chemicals sprayed in the field. \n\n \n\nDimethoate ( C5H12NO3PS ) , an\norganophosphorus compound introduced in 1956 by the American Cyanamid\nCompany, is a systemic and contact phosphorothilothionate insecticide and\nacaricide.\n\n\nIt is sold in India under the trade names Rogor, Dimethoate, Roxicon,\netc. as emulsifiable concentrate and the pesticide is extensively used by the\nfarmers ( Atwal, 1986 ) .\n\n\nThe present work is aimed to estimate the range of tolerance and\nalteration of metabolic profile in male toad by the effect of Dimethoate.\n\n\nSince most of the intermediary metabolites are phosphorylated\ncompounds, the phosphatases are important enzymes that play a key role in the\nmetabolism of the organism.\n\n\nAmong the various phosphatases present, \" ACP \" and\n\" ALP \" have attained much significance ( Brown, 1964 )\nalthough their exact physiological role has not yet been fully elucidated in\namphibian tissues.  \n\n\n MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\nAdult male non-hibernating toads, weighing 70 <*> plus or\nminus</*> 10 g. were acclimatized in the laboratory conditions for one week\nand maintained by force feeding with red  eggs on each day.\n\n\npure dimethoate ( 90 %  a.i.  ) dissolved in propylene\nglycol ( Schaffer, 1972 ) was orally instilled in the experimental group\nwhereas the control animals were fed with propylene glycol only.\n\n\nAs there was no reference on the LD50 value of this\npesticides on toad, it was estimated according to the method of Litchfield &\nWilcoxon ( 1949 ) which is 90 mg / 100 g body wt ( Pradhan & Dasgupta, 1989 ) .\n\n\nAfterwards, the experimenal animals were orally instilled with\npesticide at effective dose of 45 mg / 100 g body wt. whereas the controls\nwere fed with vehicle only.\n\n\nAfter 7 days of treatment, animals were sacrificed, blood was\ncollected in heparinised syringe, plasma separated by centrifugation and\nstored immediately in 20 <*> degrees</*> C.\n\n\nThree important metabolically active organs-liver, kidney and testis\nwere dissected out, wiped dry and stored immediately at 20 <*> degrees</*>C\nfor biochemical analysis. Tissue pieces were weighed and homogenised in 0.25\nM sucrose solution with a glass homogeniser maintained at 0-4 <*>\ndegrees</*>C for estimation of \" ACP \" & \" ALP\n\" activities. \n\n \n\nActivities of \" ACP \" & \" ALP \"\nwere estimated from plasma, liver, kidney and testis according to the\nstandard method ( Bergmeyer, 1963 ) using P-nitrophenyl phosphate as the\nsubstrate. \n\n \n\nCumulative data from the two groups was statistically analysed,\nand standard error, \" t-test \" and calculation of \"\nP-value \" were done to observe any significant variation of the\nenzymes in ciontrol and treated groups.  \n\n\n RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nMore reports on the occurrence of normal values of these enzymes\nhave appeared    than for any other single amphibian enzyme ( Brown, 1954 ) .\n\" ACP \" & \" ALP \" activity has been\nreported in adult Rana pipiens kidney, liver, heart, spleen and muscle ( Kind\n& Macchi, 1952 ) . Longley ( 1955 ) in Ambystoma, Burgos ( 1955 ) in Rana\npipiens have histochemically demonstrated ACP & ALP activities in\ndifferent tissues. Alkaline phosphatase has also been measured in\nH2O extracts of Ambystoma maxicanum and Xenopus laevis ( Krugelis,\n1949-1951 ) . \n\n \n\nThere is, however, very few records on the effect of pesticides\non the enzymatic pattern in amphibians.\n\n\nSo, most of the references in this regard have been considered fron\nnon-amphibians especially from the toxicological data on rats.\n\n\nBecause of the location of ACP & ALP in the plasma membrane of\ncells of intestinal mucosa and kidney tubules, a possible role in active\ntransport mechanism has been suggested ( Danielli, 1952 ) .\n\n\nIn mammals, osteoblast secretes large quantities of \" ALP\n\" when they are actively depositing bone matrix, some of which\ndiffuses into blood ( Guyton, 1986 ) .\n\n\nPhosphatases also play important role in gluconeogenesis, glycogen\nmetabolism, synthesis of triacylglycerols and RNA sequencing ( Stryr, 1975 ) .\nPhosphatases, in general, after being synthesized in the liver act in the\nspleen, kidneys and other organs through the blood stream; although Kind &\nMacchi ( 1952 ) showed that in Rana pipiens \" ACP \" &\n\" ALP \" level in kidney is higher than any other organ of\nthe body. \n\n \n\nTable 1 shows that after the exposure to the pesticides, there is\nsignificant increase of \" ACP \" in plasma and kidney with a\nconcomittant significant decrease in liver and testis.\n\n\nDecrease of \" ACP \" level in liver may be due to\nhepatic cytolysis causing release of lysosomal enzymes in blood resulting in\nan increase in plasma \" ACP \" which is probably transported\nto kidney for increased excretory  activity.\n\n\nDecrease of ACP level in testis reflects that metabolism of\nphosphorylated compounds is interfered by the effect of pesticide which may\nrender ultimate effect on anomalies of reproductive physiology as in rats, (\nDasgupta et al., 1989 ) . \n\n \n\nTable 1 also shows that there was a significant decrease of ALP\nin plasma and kidney but significant increase in liver and testis.\n\n\nIncrease of \" ALP \" activity in liver may be due to\nobstruction in the release of the enzyme from the liver or may be due to\nincrease in enzyme protein synthesis as a response to toxic effect of the\npesticide.\n\n\nHowever, decrease of ALP level in blood reflects that less release\nof enzyme from the liver may be a more plausible explanation.\n\n\nConsequently kidney \" ALP \" activity also decreased\nas the enzyme is transported from liver to kidney through the blood stream.\n\n\nIn rat, testicular \" ALP \" plays an important role\nin spermatogenesis, testicular harmone synthesis and intermediate\ncarbohydrate metabolism of fructose ( Davis & Longford, 1970 ) .\n\n\nIn toad, of course, this has not been elucidated. \n\n \n\nDamethoate, being a systemic pesticide possesses greater\nstabiliy in the organ systems of animals and plants ( Atwal, 1986 ) .\n\n\nThe liver is highly affected by the oral instillation of\npesticide and as it is the primary source of \" ACP \" and\n\" ALP \" , it may be supposed that metabolic disorder in\nliver results in altered enzymatic activity in plasma, kidney and testis\ncausing a possible impairment of intermediary metabolism of phosphorylated\ncompounds.  \n\n\n REFERENCES \n\n\nAtwat, A.S.  \" Agricultural Pests of India and South\nEast Asia \"  .\n\n\n2nd ed.

{"text": "EDUCATION POLICY   \n\n\n  No Serious Priorities    \n\n \n\n  ONE   is bound to be taken\naback by the simple fact that every book or report about the Indian education\nsystem written over the last three decades speaks - - and speaks rather\nloudly - - on the one hand about the crisis of higher education and, on the\nother, its massive achievement in producing a vast army of scientific and\ntechnical manpower.\n\n\nOf course, numerous problems and contradictions bedevilled the\nsystem at the time of Independence, but how we let them continue - - if we\ndid not actually ignore them - - while expanding education at all levels\nall along the line remains a mystery. \n\n \n\nA few have analysed the problem as a crisis of expansion and\ndevelopment in the sense of a transaction to a new, higher form of\neducational organization, but they have failed to explain the transition.\n\n\nThe word \" crisis \" has been used more in the\npathological sense, not to be resolved but to be administered.\n\n\nSectional educational reforms have been suggested to meet the\nsectorial crisis but not the crisis of the system. \n\n \n\nThree main reports produced negative effects.\n\n\n\" The Radhakrishnan \" Report ( 1948) belonged to\nsome other world.\n\n\n\" The Kothari \" Commission ( 1964-66), in its\nattempts to be all-comprehensive, generated many new distortions\nwithout dealing with any of the prevailing ones effectively.\n\n\nThe 1988 \" New Education Policy \" is neither new nor\na policy.\n\n\nIt is a document of and for bureaucrats and their masters. \n\n \n\nThe Indian education system is overloaded with too many\nobjectives and every objective is considered equally important.\n\n\nThere are no serious priorities.\n\n\nTherefore, it is not feasible to find or establish an optimum or\nnormative relationship between education and any other social or economic\nvariable.\n\n\nNo longitudinal analysis is feasible because of sampling\ndifficulties.\n\n\nEven to ask a student a simple question about the purpose for which\nhe is pursuing education is not easily answered as motives remain mixed\nand perspectives blurred. \n\n \n\nThis phenomenon does not apply to education only.\n\n\nThe same thing has happened to our Five-Year Plan documents.\n\n\nFrom one Plan to the next, the list of objectives and priorities\nhas become so long and their internal inconsistences so damaging that the\nPlanning Commission has only brought ridicule on itself.  \n\n\n  UTTER CONFUSION  \n\n \n\nIn fact, it may not be surprising if one finds that the number\nof crisis the system is facing is more or less the same as the number of\nobjectives with which the system is loaded or the contradictions which are\ncreated by the conflicting objectives.\n\n\nIf one finds utter confusion in educational analysis it is not\nbecause the analysis alone is faulty the elite perceptions and their skewed\npreferences do not permit any logical, let alone fruitful, analysis,\ncertainly not in forms that other nations make use of or our great\neducational thinkers of the pre-Independence era, like Tagore, Sri Aurobindo\nand Mahatma Gandhi, adopted. \n\n \n\nMore specifically, as the difficulties of adjustment between\nthe education system and the demands made upon it pile up, structural\nmaladjustments, a blurring of perspective overloading of the system, the\ndifficulties of drawing the balance-sheet between success and failure,\nbecome insurmountable.\n\n\nExcellence matched by rewards and degeneration that is not matched by\npunishment, a distinction that must be drawn between growth and\nquality, distrust and manipulation of the examination system,    declining   standards of teaching, and the\nirrelevance of research and a host of other issues connected with higher\neducation defy rational judgment. \n\n \n\nCommissions, committees, advisory councils, academic bodies,\netc., have all gone into these questions again and again.\n\n\nPartial solutions were suggested and even implemented, but the system\nmerrily went on from difficulty to difficulty, from crisis to crisis, and yet\nthe problems kept growing.\n\n\nThe term \" crisis \" has now become an\nunderstatement. \n\n \n\nThose who did not speak of a crisis also believed that though\neducation had expanded as an instrument of upward mobility,  there was something seriously wrong with it.\n\n\nThe more common refrain was that of stagnation and the gap\nbetwen educational expansion and the needs of society, the economy and the\npolity.\n\n\nThe result was that whoever produced any document or policy\nstatement on education injected his own ill-digested ideas and prejudices\ninto the corpus of motley views already existed.\n\n\nThe theoretical content of education was overloaded with the result\nthat both the young and the old are completely bewildered about the real\npurpose of education. \n\n\n  ANALYTICAL POWER  \n\n \n\nWe are told that the aim of education is to impart reading and\nwriting skills, and to train the analytical faculties of a child; to equip\nhim mentally so that he can make independent judgments about problems and\nissues; to learn the techniques of sophisticated analysis; to prepare\nyouth to be strong and competitive in a world of severe competition; to\nbe a good citizen; to get a chance to lead the nation; to preserve and enrich\nIndian traditions; to absorb the challenges of modernity; to balance value\nwith the need to promote science and to create technical and competent\nmanpower; to contribute towards economic development; to generate a new\nsense of social commitment; to imbibe all those values which the education\nsystems of the world think worth pursuing; and finally to help India find\nits place in the world of educated people. \n\n \n\nNothing seems to have been left out.\n\n\nThere was no time-frame for any objective, nor was there a tag on\npriorities.\n\n\nAs the system became overloaded, it became hopelessly out of touch\nwith current needs and reality.\n\n\nIt developed numerous contradictions and in the end became its\nown antithesis, for one objective violated some other.\n\n\nThe system explicitly and self-consciously operated on a series of\ncontradictions.\n\n\nSometimes, even pairs of contradictory concepts or objectives were\nnot recognized as contradictions but were put forward in the form of, on\nthe one hand,  \" this\"  and, on the other  \" that\"\n assuming that concepts could be simultaneously operationalised.\n\n\nThis has always been the way of all colonized intellectuals. \n\n \n\nAfter World War II numerous pressures were exerted on Third World\nnations like India to accept dependence by becoming inter-dependent.\n\n\nSome of these pressures were ideological competitiveness, the\nmilitary or geopolitical considerations of big powers to keep the largest\nareas and nations in their spheres of influence, technological\ncompulsions, trade and aid, and cultural and intellectual pressure.\n\n\nThe weaker the nations, the less successful were they in resisting\ncapitulation.\n\n\nOur efforts to become self-relient, remain non-aligned and\nstrengthen the forces of national integration and political legitimacy\nhave not been very successful, partly because we were ruled by an elite\nthat accepted the superiority of the West and was incapable of resolving\ncontradictions. \n\n \n\nAlthough it was often said that political decolonization and\nindependence have to be accompanied by economic independence, the\nsame was not said, or said with equal force, about economic decolonization.\n\n\nIndeed, the political and the educated elite created during\ncolonialism considered academic decolonization a non-issue and even\npositively harmful to what was called  \" the development of an\ninternational horizon\"  , or  \" technical excellence\" \n, or the needs of  \" modernization\"  . \n\n \n\nIn 1947 there were two major streams of thought and policy\nframework that could have influenced education.\n\n\nThe first was Gandhian in which the dismantling of colonial\neducation was of paramount importance.\n\n\nDuring the Independence struggle, Gandhi not merely denounced the\neducation system introduced by the British; for the purpose of the national\nstruggle he started a parallel system.\n\n\nHe was aware of the danger of cultural colonization remaining\nafter the British were gone.\n\n\nSince higher education was to be the pinnacle of the new cultural\nsystem and the creator of the new elite, it was natural that a dependent\npinnacle would produce a dependent elite having an international horizon\nthat served the capitalist neo-colonial or Communist-imperialist elite.\n\n\n \n\nThe other was  imitation model.\n\n\nHe thought it best to retain the colonial system and use it for the\nnew modernization.\n\n\nBut he made two serious mistakes.\n\n\nFirst, against  advice he made Maulana Azad the\nEducation Minister.\n\n\nThe Maulana was a one-sided scholar.\n\n\nAdmittedly, he was conscious of the damage done to Indian society\nby the British colonial system of education, but he stopped at that.\n\n\nOccasionally, he made some very telling and perceptive remarks about\ndifferent issues.\n\n\nSome of his speeches in Parliament and the Constituent Assembly\nwere incisive.\n\n\nBut his words and ideas never added up to a new model, a new\nperspective or a new    thrust   for national\neducation.\n\n\nSurprisingly, he and Nehru differed on vital issues but  views prevailed.\n\n\nMaulana Azad slipped into total unconcern. \n\n\n   FAILURE  \n\n \n\nSecondly, Nehru failed to generate a movement for mass\neducation through which he could have undermined the colonial elite\ndomination of our education.\n\n\nHe was more autobiographical than critical.\n\n\nThe entire burden of change fell on higher education which it could\nnot bear as the system produced imitators rather than producers of knowledge.\n\n\n \n\nHow does one reduce the load on the system?\n\n\nIt is easier said than done.\n\n\nThe critical change required is for the state to give up the\nfinancial and academic responsibility for providing higher education to\nanyone except these who are poor.\n\n\nThose who can pay must pay on the principle of full cost pricing or\nsome income criteria.\n\n\nEven in a nation as rich as the USA, 54 per cent of those who receive\neducation pay for it.\n\n\nThere is no hope of any reform in our system unless the poor stop\npaying for the education of the rich and the middle classses.\n\n\nOnce the principle of equity is accepted, the system will start\ndivesting itself of unnecessary baggage.  <*> two parallel lines one bold\nand slim below and above editorial comment </*>  \n\n \n\n\n  I know a child who begs   <*> bold red band\nbelow the title </*>  \n\n \n\n  ARE   you the sort of person who quickly\nlooks the other way on seeing a child who begs?\n\n\nOr who thrusts a coin indifferently in his palm just to get rid of\nhim?\n\n\nYou probably take comfort in the knowledge that you are not\nalone; most people shun street children.\n\n\nBut what would happen if you didn't turn away? \n\n \n\nThere are several who did - - and found themselves transformed\nby the experience.\n\n\nOne day in 1962, B B Singh, while waiting at a traffic light in\nMahim, Bombay, met Ramesh, a begger-child.\n\n\nOn an impulse Singh put a proposition before Ramesh - - he would\nemploy Ramesh as domestic provided the boy attended school, Ramesh agreed.\n\n\nFrom that day, he cleaned and kept house for the Singhs, then\nattended a municipal school.\n\n\nHe did not appear to like school but Singh and his wife were firm.\n\n\nThen one day, Ramesh left and never came back. \n\n \n\nThe Singhs, disappointed but still resolute, waited for another\nchild they could help - - and found Keshav.\n\n\nFor eight years, they showered their affection on the orphan from\nUttar Pradesh.\n\n\nThey were overjoyed when Keshav matriculated and found a good job.\n\n\nThen the Singhs went abroad for two years and Keshav moved out of\ntheir house.\n\n\nWhen they returned after two years they were told that  body had been found floating in a well.\n\n\n friends attribute the death to \nterrible depression at being separated from the Singhs.\n\n\nUnable to cope with his grief, he had probably committed suicide.\n\n\n \n\nThe Singhs, heartbroken, vowed never to love another child so\nmuch, but their lives were not to remain untouched by a  for\nlong. \n\n \n\nToday Singh and his wife continue to provide a better life to\nunderprivileged children.\n\n\nAt the moment they are searching for a suitable groom for Venu, who\nhas been with them for some years.\n\n\nShe has completed a three-year training course in teaching\ntailoring, cutting and embroidering, and currently runs her own boutique.\n\n\n \n\nM V Anil discovered a 12-year-old beggar-child at a bus-stop one\nday.\n\n\n  Saab, ek rupaiya do.\n\n\nBhagwan aapka bhala karega   .\n\n\n \" I decided to speak to the child,\"  says Anil.\n\n\nHe told him that he would give him a  rupee  if he\nwould talk to him for a while.\n\n\nThe child agreed, though reluctantly. \n\n \n\nAnil learnt, with surprise, that Kishore, the beggar-child, also\nearned some money washing cars.\n\n\nHis income went straight to his alcoholic father.\n\n\nSchool was unaffordable.\n\n\nIf Kishore wished to play video games or craved sweets like other\nchildren, he had to beg for money, because asking his father usually meant a\nthrashing.\n\n\nAnil gave Kishore the promised  rupee  .\n\n\nLooking at the  delighted face Anil wished he\ncould have given him something more useful. \n\n \n\nFor 18-year-old Simi, an innocuous roadside conversation with\na dozen or so beggar-children eroded a few myths she had grown up with.\n\n\nNone of the children, Simi learnt, begged because they liked to.\n\n\nThey begged to support their families.\n\n\nLike seven-year-old Sanjay whose alcoholic father did not have an\nincome.\n\n\nOr Sonia, whose family needed the money to repay the loan which had\nbeen taken for her  operation after she was injured in a\nbomb blast in Pathankot. \n\n \n\n \" One realises that children beg not because they like\nit, but because it is often their only means of survival.\n\n\nOne thing I am sure of now - -  like to help.\" \n <*> line below and above the article </*> <&>\n\n

{"text": "Revived \n\n\n Carnival Jamboree  \n\n\n By <@AS> Anthony Fernandes {#} \n\n \n\n It is just impossible to kill for good any thing that is even\nremotely connected to fun in Goa and this, is evident from the fact that the\nCarnival which was discontinued for a brief spell in 1987 due to public\nopposition is now gaining momentum once again, though very cautiously.\n\n\n \n\nThere are many theories as to the origins of Carnival and why it\nis celebrated but, in Goa, I think it just caught on because  \" it is\nfun.\"  \n\n \n\nOver the years, however, the fun started to degenerate into\nvulgarity thanks largely to the government who openly encouraged our women to\ndress scantily and dance on the streets. \n\n \n\nConfronted with this accusation the government denied the\nallegations, but the fact  remains that the Department of Tourism\nfunded street floats and advertised extensively in national dailies to\nattract domestic tourists to the state. \n\n \n\nThe fun degenerated further - - alcohol was used and abused in\nunlimited quantities and some time later even drugs found their way in.\n\n\n \n\nFor that matter, at one stage a serious allegation was levelled by\na social organisation that more abortions were performed in Goa soon after\nCarnival than any other period of the year. \n\n \n\nIn the face of these allegations and the virtual highjacking of\nthe celebrations by some of the big companies who used the occasion to\nfurther their interests by sponsoring floats, the public decided that\nenough is enough. \n\n \n\nSome very socially and morally concerned groups like the Jagrut\nGoemkaracho Fauz and the Bailancho Saad decided that the Carnival must\nstop if our young boys and girls had to be saved and thus following an\nagitation in 1987 there was no Carnival. \n\n \n\nBut then the good Goan decided that all good things ( or bad)\ngenerally associated with fun, must not come to an end, hence in 1988 the\nentertainment king of Goa Francisco Martins popularly known as Fanquito,\ndecided to revive the Carnival in a novel manner. \n\n \n\nMr Martins with the help of any one who was interested organised\na  carnival led by a float comprising of small children\nfollowed by adults in any vehicle that was available to them. \n\n \n\nSubsequently, the following year, Armando Gonsalves and some of\nhis friends decided to    organise   a junk\ncar rally after sun down in the city which, incidentally, became an\ninstant success. \n\n \n\nThe traditional dances on the three days of carnival, however\nwere held, but the mood was low. \n\n \n\nAnd now, in 1990, during the third year of its revival, the\ncarnival is slowly, but cautiously gaining momentum and will be celebrated on\na much larger scale starting at 5 pm of February 24. \n\n \n\nOrganised by Show Biz, the floats this year promise to be unique\nin the sense that there will not be just one King Momo. \n\n \n\nAny one who wishes to be King Momo can enter  \n the   fray along with his float and the most imaginative group\nwill be awarded a cash prize of Rs 5,000. \n\n \n\nThe agenda for the 24th evening is vast and, it seems that it is\njust one more step in the direction of fully reviving the carnival, but the\norganisers promise never to let it go back to be what it was before 1987.\n  \n\n\n\n\n  Here Once Again \n\n\n By <@AS> Rajan Narayan {#} \n\n \n\nThe Government sponsored Carnival died three years ago.\n\n\nIt was buried following popular protests against the\ncommercialisation and increasing vulgarity which had crept into the\nGovernment sponsored Carnival.\n\n\nAnd out of the ashes of the government sponsored Carnival, the   Carnaval  was born. \n\n \n\nThe first   carnaval  took\nplace under the shadow of the discontent and dissatisfaction of several\nGoenkars about the content of the official language bill which had just\nbeen passed.\n\n\nSome of those who took part in the battle for making Konkani the\nexclusive official language of the State of Goa, were not happy with the\nofficial language bill.\n\n\nThey had called for a boycott of the  carnaval  .\n\n\nBut a few courageous Goenkars decided to defy the boycott.\n\n\nThey decided to revive the spirit of good old  carnaval\n .\n\n\nThere were hardly a couple of floats.\n\n\nBut there were no advertisements from commercial organisation.\n\n\nThere were no Bamboo fences separating the participants from the\naudience.\n\n\nAnd I recall that though the Travel and Tourism club had decided not\nto risk its neck, two members of the club Mr Babu Keni of the Mandovi Hotel\nand Mr Sunil Naik of the Samrat Hotel defied the club and participated in\nthe  carnaval with their families. \n\n \n\nIt was a    symbolic   beginning.\n\n\nMarking the revival of the spirit of the  carnaval\n .\n\n\nThe good old  carnaval  .\n\n\nAnd the next year the  carnaval  was transformed\ninto a junk car rally.\n\n\nWithout floats <*> dotted-line</*>\n\n\nBut with music.\n\n\nAnd with cars and motorcycles and scooters all dressed up of\nvarious vintages in all shapes and sizes. \n\n \n\nAnd last year, the Junk car rally remained.\n\n\nBut in addition there were a few floats.\n\n\nMercifully they were no commercial floats.\n\n\nAnd the government kept out.\n\n\nAnd bamboo barriers were not erected.\n\n\nAnd there was a greater sense of participation.\n\n\nAnd a good time was had by one and all. \n\n \n\nHappy days are here again.\n\n\n Carnaval  times are here again.\n\n\nAnd this year  be the usual junk car rally.\n\n\nAnd there will be a King Momo contest.\n\n\n   And   there will be floats which will\nexplore the natural beauty of Goa.\n\n\nWhich I hope and pray will not include the  tavernas\n and nude hippies on the beaches of Goa.\n\n\nThough there may be some argue that  feni  and nudism\nare now part of the heritage of Golden Goa. \n\n \n\nHappy day are again.\n\n\n Carnaval  times are here again.\n\n\nA time to let you hair down.\n\n\nA time to let yourself go.\n\n\nBut for  sake let us make sure it is good clean fun.\n\n\n \n\nOnce upon a time, some little boys were throwing stones at some\nfrogs in a pond.\n\n\nAnd a little frog came out of the pond and told the little boys\n \" this may be fun for you but death for us\"  .  \n\n\n\n\n Smoke Signals \n\n\n Facts on fags \n\n \n\nSMOKING is back in fashion, as if in a backlash to the\nhealth-conscious past.\n\n\nForeign advertisements for clothes, perfume and even department\nstores include leggy models languorously drawing on cigarettes.\n\n\nAdvertisers claim their intention is not to make smoking\nfashionable but  \" to give an image that is relaxed and casual.\"\n \n\n \n\nDespite medical evidence that it messes up hormones, causes\ncancer and coronary heart disease and eventually kills - - smoking continues\nto be imbued with sex appeal, sophistication and even adventure.\n\n\nThe  'cool'  image of models smoking is in direct\ncontrast to the issue of health-racking cough, bad breath and disease.\n\n\n \n\nCelluloid also emits a similar smoke signal.\n\n\nLauren Bacall was moulded into a female Bogart exuding sexual\nantagonism and emotional call.\n\n\nBogart in  'To Have and Have Not,'      inflames    the tension between them by lighting her\ncigarette.\n\n\nIn  'The Big Sleep'  the insolent, wealthy    divorcee   , Bacall controls Bogart all the\nwhile drawing on a cigarette. \n\n \n\nThe panache with which Bette Davis delivered her lines was\nunderscored with an authoritative pull on a cigarette.\n\n\nHer chain smoking in  'Now Voyager'  - - in which Paul\n   Henreid   constantly lights a cigarette and\nhands one to her - - is legendary.\n\n\nIn  'Morocco'  , Marlene  \n    top hat, tails and cigarette added to an\nimage of sexual power and ambiguity. \n\n \n\nThe slant in cigarette advertising ranges from the romantic to\nthe titillating and the statutory health warning goes unnoticed. \n\n \n\nSmoking has been a time-honoured means of coping with stress,\nmisery, anger or frustration as chain-smoking Jodie Foster shows in\n 'The Accused'  . \n\n \n\nHowever, the popular picture is of cool and composed female\nsmokers - - the notion that cigarettes are a form of personal emancipation\nalbeit expensive remains uncontested. \n\n \n\n<*> star</*> Women are at greater risk of cardiovascular disease,\nheart attack and strokes if taking the Pill as well as smoking.\n\n\n<*> star</*> Women who smoke during pregnancy risk complications and\ngiving birth to babies of lower than average weight.\n\n\n<*> star</*> Smoking is an independent risk factor for cervical\ncancer and may be linked to cancer of the urinary track and pancreas.\n\n\n<*> star</*> The menopause occurs 2-3 years earlier in smokers. \n<*_> square <*/> \n\n\n\n \n\n  LONAVALA CHIKKI     \n\n\n Maganlal and Sons have been making  chikki  for\nalmost hundred years \n\n \n\nFOR anyone travelling on the Bombay-Pune road a halt at the\nMaganlal and  shop in Lonavala is a must.\n\n\nThe shop is synonymous with the place and is famous for \nchikki  - the fame of which has reached far-and-wide.\n\n\nHardly anyone ever drives past without stopping to buy a packet of\n  chikki   - - for self, family or friends. \n\n \n\nThe success story of Maganlal and Sons dates back to 1882.\n\n\nBhivraj Agarwal, accompanied by his 16-year-old son, Maganlal, left\nhis ancestral home near Agra, in search of business opportunities.\n\n\nIn those days, the  ghat  railway line from Karjat\nto Khandala, was under construction and thousands of labourers toiled the\nwhole day.\n\n\nThis provided a golden opportunity for Bhivraj to start some kind\nof business.\n\n\nHe began preparing   gurdani   - - sweet made\nfrom jaggery and groundnuts of   kurmura   (\npuffed rice) and sold it to the workers.\n\n\nInexpensive and filling this sweet became and instant hit. \n\n \n\n efforts paid off.\n\n\nThis was the beginning of his   chikki  \nbusiness.\n\n\nHe marketed the   chikki   under the trade\nname of Maganlal, after his son expired in 1930.\n\n\nThen, his son Ambalal took over the business but with his death in\n1968, Mohanlal took charge.\n\n\nHe involved his sons as well as the sons of Ambalal.\n\n\nAfter the demise of Mohanlal a couple of months ago,\nChandraprakash, Pralhad, Suresh, Bharat and Dhruva have taken over the reins\nof the family enterprise. \n\n \n\nInforms Dhruva,  \" The   chikki  \nacquired a neat package and was sold at Lonavala railway station from\n1940.   \"    <\n\n\nThe salubrious weather year-round and vantage position on railways\nand highways ( the shop is located opposite the station) have increased\nprofits.\n\n\nThe large Parsi population as also of Christians and Anglo-Indians,\npopularised the  chikki  .\n\n\nIt is today a hot favourite of tourists. \n\n \n\nThe shop received a facelift in 1982, when the pioneers\ncelebrated the centenary of their   chikki  \nbusiness, which was further streamlined to facilitate diversification.\n\n\n \n\nThe spruced up sales-counter is lined up with a variety of\n  chikki   - - groundnut, coconut, puffed rice,\ncashew nuts, almonds and others.\n\n\nDhruva Agarwal says,   \" We have also introduced \n mamra-badam chikki   the best quality   badam\n  available.\n\n\nAlso crushed groundnut butter   chikki  \nwith   elaichi   ( cardamom),   elaichi\nchikki   candy, crushed groundnut chocolates are recently\nintroduced.\n\n\nMost popular is crushed groundnut with   elaichi\nchikki   , grated coconut   chikki   ,\nand,   cashew-kesharbadam pista chikki   .\" \n\n\n\nThe price varies from Rs. 24 per kg. to Rs. 280 per kg.\n\n\nDelicious fudges are also available at the shop. \n\n \n\nThe various ingredients that go into making   chikki\n  come from various parts of the country.\n\n\nJaggery from Kolhapur and Sangli, glucose from Bombay,\nAhmedabad and Hyderabad, groundnuts from Sangli, dry fruits from\nBombay, coconut from Karnataka and cashewnuts from Goa.\n\n\nThe   farsan   section includes crisp, spicy\n  palak sev   , garlic  sev  , \n bhakharwadi   ,   navratna farsan \n .\n\n\nThe specialities from Bengal are   rasmalai \n with pure saffron,   rosgullas   , \n kalajamun   ,   chandrakala   and\n  malai   sandwich. \n\n \n\n  \" We are also famous for our   jalebis\n  which are popular with Bombayites who visit Lonavala.\n\n\nWe have three types of  jalebis  - - the regular\nvariety, those made with saffron and the large  jalebis \ngarnished with petals - - very popular during Pateti with the Parsi    clientele   , \"   says Dhruva.\n\n\n  \" All classes of people buy our   chikki\n  and as far as possible we do not wont to raise our prices.\n\n\nThis is also one of the reasons why we do not want to go in for\nfancy packaging.\"   \n\n \n\nFrom a humble beginning, Maganlal and Sons is now a\nwell-established industry with an annual business turn-over of Rs. 12 \nlakhs  .\n\n\n home-made   chikki  \nintroduced over a hundred years ago has become a popular

{"text": "Oxidation of dyes by manganese tetraphenyl porphyrin activated\nperoxy bleach   \n\n\n R G BHIRUD, E V SRISANKAR  and  K S NARAYAN    \n\n \n\n  Abstract.  \n\n\nThe oxidation of a number of dyes in predominantly aqueous systems by\ntetraphenylporphyrinato manganese ( III ) imidazole, MnTPP ( Im ) , activated\nperoxy bleach has been studied in the context of application in detergent\nsystems.\n\n\nDyes with an olefinic linkage in the chromophoric group are readily\noxidized by perborate even in the absence of the activator.\n\n\nOn the other hand, dyes with an azo linkage are resistant to oxidation\nand are bleached only to a limited extent ( 25 % ) even by MnTPP ( Im )\nactivated perborate.\n\n\nIn the presence of a surfactant, alkylbenzene sulphonate, bleaching is\nfurther inhibited by micellar solubilization of the dyes.\n\n\nSulphonation of MnTPP(Im) only marginally improves the bleaching\nefficiency in presence of the surfactant.\n\n\nMnTPP ( Im ) is also destroyed by perborate in the absence of the\nsubstrate.\n\n\nIn view of these limitations, the metalloporphyrin activated peroxy\nbleach system is not promising for application in detergent systems.\n\n\nAttempts have also been made to explain the difference in the\nbehaviour of different substrates on structural consideration. \n\n \n\n  Keywords.   \" Bleaching; \"\n\" oxidation; \" \" dyes; \" \"\nperborate; \" \" Mn-porphyrin; \" \"\nalkylbenzene sulphonate; \" micellar effects. \n\n\n  1. Introduction  \n\n \n\nTransition metal complex mediated oxidation processcs are\nreceiving attention in recent times.\n\n\nThis concept is based on the analogy with cytochrome P-450 whose key\nfeature is the involvement of a metalloprophyrin complex ( Coon and White\n1980; Guengerich and MacDonald 1985 ) .\n\n\nThe oxidation of olefins to epoxides ( White and Coon 1980; Collman\n et al  1985 ) , alkanes to alcohols ( Guengerich and MacDonald 1984 )\n, dialkylamines to amine oxides ( Poulos  et al  1985 ) with oxygen\nsupply from an exogenous source has given a lot of impetus to work on model\nsystems using metalloporphyrins.\n\n\nHigh valent metallophorphyrin oxidizing species have been obtained\nwith iron ( Groves  et al  1981 ) , manganese ( Hill and Schardt\n1980 ) and chromium ( Groves and Haushalter 1981 ) .\n\n\nMost of the studies rcported employ oxygen donors such as\nalkylhydroperoxide, peracids, iodosylbenzene, amine oxide, persulphate (\nCollman  et al  1985; Depoorter and Meunier 1985; Groves and Quinn\n1985; Renaud  et al  1985 ) .\n\n\nInvariably two-phase systems have been employed with the oxidant in\nthe    aqueous phase while the non-aqueous phase contains\nmetalloporphyrin and the substrate along with a phase transfer catalyst. \n\n \n\nWe thought it would be worthwhile examining the versatility of\nthe metalloporphyrin mediated peroxy bleach system by studying the bleaching\nof dyes in predominantly aqueous systems by manganese porphyrins.\n\n\nA range of dyes with different reactive groups such as azo, olefinic\nand different structural features have been selected.\n\n\nBleaching experiments have been carried out in two solvent systems\nand also in a micellar system to delineate the behaviour in these systems.\n\n\nWe also wanted to examine the applicability of this bleaching\nprinciple to detergent systems and have, therefore, used sodium perborate, a\ncommon bleaching agent in detergent systems as the oxygen donor and linear\nalkylbenzene sulphonate ( LAS), a versatile surfactant used in detergents.\n\n\nWe also felt that it would be of interest to study the effect of\nsolubilizing the metalloporphyrin through sulphonation. \n\n\n  2. Experimental  \n\n\n 2.1  Chemicals  \n\n \n\nImidazole, direct yellow-9, rhodamine 6G,\n4-nitrophenyl-azoresorcinol,  p-dimethly-amino\nbenzylidenerhodanine, carmine AS, carmine MS were obtained from BDH, England.\n\n\nDirect red-23, direct red-81, quinaldine blue, quinaldine red, \nm-chloroper-benzoic acid were obtained from Sigma or Aldrich.\n\n\nEriochrome blue black, eriochrome black T, methyl orange, methyl red\nand fuchsin basic were from Merck.\n\n\nSunset yellow and tartrazine were cosmetic grade dyestuffs ( ex\nDevarsons Limited ) .\n\n\nStructures of the various dyes are given in figure 1. 5, 10, 15,\n20-tetraphenylporphyrin ( TPP ) and tetraammonium tetra ( \np-sulphophenyl ) porphyrin ( TPPS ) were obtained from Organic Chemistry\nSection, HLRC.\n\n\nLinear alkylbenzene sulphonate ( LAS ) , sodium tripoly-phosphate\n( STP) and sodium carbonate were commercial samples.\n\n\nDimethyl-formamide ( DMF ) and methanol were of reagent grade ex\nE.

case of quinaldine blue by MnTPP ( Im )    in aqueous LAS medium.\n\n\nFigure 4 gives the data on the change in spectral characteristics of\nMnTPPS ( Im ) mixed with sodium perborate in the absence of substrate.\n\n\nThe change in absorbance in the presence and absence of MnTPP ( Im )\nas a function of time at the <*> i</*> max of the substrate are given in\nfigure 5 in the case of quinaldine blue as an illustrative example of the\nkinetic course of the reaction. \n\n\n 3.1  Bleaching in aqueous-solvent systems  \n\n \n\nThe absorption spectra as a function of time presented in figure\n2 in the case of direct red-81 is indicative of the typical course of\nreaction.\n\n\nDecrease in absorption at 514 nm, the strong absorption maximum of\nthe dye, and simultaneous increase in absorption at 400nm, which is\nsuggestive of the formation of a less conjugated product, are clearly seen.\n\n\n \n\nThe absorption spectra of the reaction mixture in the case of\nquinaldine blue before addition of perborate and after the reaction is\ncomplete are presented in figure 3 and the results again show the\ndisappearance of the strong maximum and increase in absorption / appearance\nof new peaks at lower wave lengths again indicating the formation of species\nwith reduced conjugation.\n\n\nThere is a decrease in the intensity of the Soret band showing that\nsome of the MnTPP ( Im ) is also oxidized. \n\n \n\nIn the absence of the substrate MnTPPS ( Im ) appears to react\nreadily with perborate ( figure 4 ) .\n\n\nAt first there is a shift in the absorption maximum from 470 nm to\n436 nm and the doublet at 380 and 400 nm disappears ( the peak at 400 nm\nmight have merged with the primary maximum ) .\n\n\nThese spectral changes may perhaps be due to the formation of the\nhigher valent manganese complex ( as shown in the scheme in figure ( 6 ) (\nHill and Schardt 1980 ) .\n\n\nHowever, within 5 minutes MnTPPS ( Im ) is totally destroyed as\nperceived by the drastic reduction in intensity of the absorption bands. \n\n \n\nIt is seen from the results on the oxidation of the substrates by\nperborate in the absence of MnTPP ( Im ) in aqueous methanolic solution that\nas expected quinaldine blue and quinaldine red with olefinic linkage between\nthe aromatic moieties are the      most susceptible species for bleaching.\n\n\nRhodamine 6G with quaternary group is also susceptible to bleaching\nalthough not to the same extent as the dyes with the olefinic linkage.\n\n\nHowever, rhodamine  B  is very resistant to bleaching.\n\n\nThis resistance is perhaps due to the additional electron donating\nalkyl substitution on the quaternary nitrogen thus imparting a stabilizing\neffect. \n\n \n\nThe azo dyes appear to be resistant to oxidation by perborate and\nless than 10 % bleaching has been noticed in the case of all the azo dyes\nexamined.\n\n\nEven in the presence of the activator, MnTPP ( Im ) the azo dyes are\nbleached only to a limited extent of 25 %.\n\n\nThe only exception is eriochrome blue black which is bleached in the\npresence of the catalyst in aqueous methanolic/DMF medium to the extent of 90\n%.\n\n\nAzo dyes as a class are known for their stability.\n\n\nHowever, the reasons for the susceptibility of eriochrome blue black\nto bleaching are not clear.\n\n\nThe reactions in    the case of this dye also\nappear to be somewhat complex.\n\n\nThe dye is bleached within a few seconds, but with time the colour is\npartially regained. \n\n \n\nIn the case of oxidation in aqueous methanol it is seen from\nresults presented in table 1 that quinaldine blue, quinaldine red and\nrhodamine 6G are oxidized by perborate even in the absence of MnTPP ( Im ) .\n\n\nIn aqueous DMF quinaldine blue is not oxidized.\n\n\nThe reasons for this solvent effect are not very clear.\n\n\nIn general, it has been found in the case of most of the dyes\nstudied that the extent of oxidation increases in presence of MnTPP ( Im ) ,\nthe only exception being rhodamine B.\n\n\nIn the presence of the activator also isolated cases of solvent\neffect are perceived.\n\n\nEriochrome black T appears to be more resistant to oxidation in\nmethanolic medium.\n\n\nIt has been reported that olefins show higher rates of oxidation in\nmethanolic medium because the high valent oxomanganese species ( oxygen\ntransferring ) rapidly reacts with substrate ( Razenberg  et al \n1986 ) .\n\n\nHowever, no such general trend was observed in the case of the dyes\nexamined. \n\n \n\nOn substitution of manganese by cobalt it was found that the\ncatalyzing effect was completely lost.\n\n\nQuinaldine blue, quinaldine red, direct red 81, eriochrome blue\nblack which are bleached in aqueous DMF by MnTPP ( Im ) were not at all\nbleached by CoTPP ( Im ) .\n\n\nThe reasons for the ineffectivity of CoTPP ( Im ) may be due to the\nlack of formation of high valent oxygen donating species.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "Taxation and Savings  in the Household\nSector  in India   \n\n\nM.C. NAHAR  *  <*> line from left to right</*>  <*> line from left to\nright</*>\n\n \n\n  ONE   of the major objectives\nof tax policy in a developing economy is to mobilise resources for\nbalanced development of both public and private sectors.\n\n\nTax policy through its composition, incentives and some coercive\nmeasures affects private savings.\n\n\nWhile promoting savings in the private sector, it also channelises the\ninvestible funds into preferred / desired directions.  \n\n \n\nIn India, tax policy relating to direct taxes ( income-tax,\nwealth-tax etc. ) primarily aims at reducing disparities of income and\nwealth distribution, curbing conspicuous consumption among people in\nhigher  income brackets and channelising the\nsavings in specific directions by offering incentives.\n\n\nIndirect taxes are intended to collect more revenues, and curb\nconsumption and expenditure ( both luxury and nonluxury items ) in the\nprivate sector, thus making people spend thrift, thereby promoting savings.\n\n\nThus our tax system through its  ` income effect' \nreduces disposable income, and thereby the capacity to save; and through\nincentives it promotes savings in the private sector (  `\nsubstitution effect'  ) , particularly of the tax payers. \n\n \n\nPrivate savings in our country constitutes savings generated by\nthe household sector and private corporate sector.\n\n\nTable 1 shows that the     household sector contributes\nover 75 % of the Gross Domestic Savings ( GDS ) in our country.\n\n\nThis sector also bears the major share of our tax burden ( both\ndirect and indirect ) which affects its savings potential adversely.\n\n\nDuring the eighties efforts were made to raise tax revenue on the\none hand and on the other to provide incentives for the promotion of\nsavings in the private sector, particularly the household sector.\n\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to study the influence of these efforts\non the savings in the household sector in India during 1980-81 to I987-88.\n\n\n\n  Incentive Measures  \n\n \n\nThe Government initiated a number of steps through tax policy to\naugment savings in the household sector in our country.\n\n\nSome specific measures taken in this direction during our\nreference period are narrated below.  \n\n\n  Adjustments in Tax Rates  \n\n \n\nThe rates of both direct and indirect taxes were adjusted from\ntime to time to meet the objectives such are revenue collection, curbing\nconsumption expenditure and increasing saving capacity of the tax payers.\n\n\nRates of income-tax and wealth-tax were revised downward so as to\ncreate a climate of reasonable tax rate structure, thereby to ensure\nbetter compliance by assessees to tax laws and also enhance their saving\ncapacity.\n\n\nThe rates of income-tax were brought down from the highest marginal\nrate of 60 % ( 72 % with surcharge ) on income over Rs. 1  lakh\n in assessment year 1981-82 to 50 % in the assessment year\n1986-87.\n\n\nThe wealth-tax rates were brought down to the maximum of 2 %\nduring the same period. \n\n\n  Exemption Limit  \n\n \n\nThe general exemption limit under income tax law was gradually\nenhanced from Rs. 12,000 in assessment year 1981-82 to Rs.\n15,000, Rs. 18,OOO in assessment years 1982-83 and 1986-87 respectively.\n\n\nIt was further raised to Rs. 22,000 for assessment year 1991-92.\n\n\nThe wealth-tax exemption limit was raised to  Rs. 2.5  lakhs  with effect from Assessment year\n1986-87 and that of gift-tax to Rs. 20,000 from assessment year 1987-88.\n\n\n\n  Incentive Provisions under Direct Tax Laws  \n\n \n\n( 1) Tax concession on savings and income on such savings (\nmostly financial assets under Sections 80 C and 80 ( L) were liberalised\nfrom time to time in terms of both their scope and deduction.\n\n\nThe monetary ceilings were also raised.\n\n\nThe investments in National Savings Certificates  6\n and  7  issues ( discontinued from assessment year\n1990-91 ) , National Deposits Scheme, etc. were considered for tax concession\npurposes.\n\n\nThe tax coneessions had considerably enhanced the post-tax rate\nof return on such investments. \n\n ( 2)\n\n\nTax concessions with respect to investments in specified shares under\nSection 80 ( CC ) was liberalised by raising monetary ceiling to Rs. 20,000.\n\n\n \n\n( Note :  \" The Finance Act \"  , 1990\nhas made a change in the matter of tax concessions under Seetions 80 ( C )\nand 80 ( CC ) .\n\n\nThe present scheme of deduction under these sections has been\nreplaced by the rebate under Sections 88 and 88 A, respectively.\n\n\nThe tax rebate is granted @ 20 % of such investments subject to\nmonetary ceilings prescribed under the Act. )\n\n \n\n\" Capital gains tax \" provisions were relaxed\nand exemptions granted in certain cases if such gains were invested in\nresidential house and / or in some notified financial instruments ( assets )\netc. [ Sections 48, 54, 54 E, etc. ] \n\n \n\n( 4) Tax concessions were extended to non-resident Indians\non their investments in India.\n\n\nHigher rate of interest on deposits made by them in approved\ninstitutions was permitted. \n\n \n\n( 5) Depreciation provisions and investment allowances etc. were\nrationlised to promote replacements and renewals. \n\n \n\n( 6) Funding Scheme of \" IDBI \" was introduced\nand tax concessions granted on it. \n\n \n\n( 7) Public Sector Bonds ( in some cases ) with tax-free interest\nwere permitted to be floated.\n\n\nThe investments in such bonds were also granted wealth-tax exemption.\n\n\n \n\n( 8) Mutual Fund Schemes by public sector financial\ninstitutions like \" UTI \" , \" LIC \" and\nsome nationalised banks were introduced.\n\n\nThey were granted tax concessions under Sections 80 ( CC ) and 80\n( L ) .\n\n\n[ Section 80 ( CC ) has been replaced by Section 88 ( A ) by\nFinance Act l990. ] \n\n\n  Coercive Measures  \n\n \n\nCoercive measures like compulsory Deposit Scheme ( 1974 )\nremained in operation till March 31, 1985 with interest and tax benefits.\n\n\n \n\nSome other measures of imporance are :\n\n\n( a) overall increase in the interest rates on term deposits,\nprovident fund contributions, debentures, public deposits with corporate\nbodies etc.;\n\n\n( b) Issue of ( i) Capital Investnent Bonds and ( ii) Social\nSecurity Certificates by the Government for specific purposes etc.\n\n\nThese measures also had helped in augmenting savings. \n\n\n  Impact of Incentives on Taxation  \n\n \n\nAfter a brief account of some of the tax incentive provisions\nunder our tax laws, we shall now see how taxation ( with such incentives )\naffected the household savings during the period. \n\n \n\nAs has been mentioned earlier taxes affect the household savings\nthrough their influence on both the aspects of savings i.e. capacity to  save and incentive to save.\n\n\nThe  ` income effect'  of taxes reduces the personal\nincome and thereby the capacity to save ( as saving is a function of\nincome ) .\n\n\nTaxes through their  ` redistributive effect'  also\naffect the capacity to save.\n\n\nIf the redistribution of income after taxes is in favour of poor\npeople, the saving rate is likely to be adversely affected.\n\n\nIt is based on the premise that poor people have higher propensity to\nconsume and therefore they will either be not saving at all or saving at a\nvery low rate compared to wealthy people.\n\n\nTaxation affects incentive to save ( substitution of\nconsumption by saving - -  ` substitution effect'  ) through\nits effect on rate of return on the amount saved and invested.\n\n\nIf the post-tax rate of return is attractive, households ( tax\npayers ) will be prompted to save ( leaving apart other considerations\nlike liquidity, pledgeability, contractual saving obligations, etc. )\n\n\nThe various incentive provisions  \nin tax laws relating to promotion of savings also channelise\nsuch savings in the desired directions ( diversion effect ) .\n\n\nThe type of tax ( direct or indirect ) and the rate structure of\ntaxation ( progressive, regressive or proportional ) , also have some\nbearing on household savings.\n\n\nIt should be noted that taxation is only one of the factors affecting\nsavings in the household sector.\n\n\nThere are a number of other socio-economic factors which influence\nsavings such as level of income, rate of interest, inflation, distribution of\nnational income, old age requirements, social and family obligations,\nsocial status, education level and habits. \n\n \n\nThe  capacity to save is affected by tax\nburden.\n\n\nIf it is assumed that all indirect taxes1 are ultimately\nborne by the households in our country; and the total non-corporate taxes\n( direct and indirect ) which households bear have increased constantly in\nterms of both absolute figures and in percentage points to personal income (\nrefer Tables 2 and 3 ) .\n\n\nThus the personal income ( capacity to save) is supposed to have\nreduced by the amount of taxes so paid or borne by the households. \n\n \n\nSince the rate of savings of the household sector during the\nreference period shows erratic fluctuations i.e. between 16.25 % and\n19.46 % of personal income  5 ( Table 2 ) , the marginal saving\nrate3 which works    out to 20.29 % is considered a better measure / indicator to\nknow the effect of tax burden on potential savings in the household\nsector.\n\n\nThus, if taxes are paid, potential savings in this sector will be\nreduced by 20.29 % of the taxes so paid.\n\n\nIt is assumed here that taxes are paid at the cost of both\nconsumption and savings.\n\n\nBut, if it is considered that taxes paid do not affect consumption\nand are paid out of savings by the tax payers, then the whole of the amount\npaid by way of taxes could have been saved by them in the absence of\ntaxation. \n\n \n\nWhile considering the reduction in the \ncapacity to save as a result of tax payments, we should not ignore the\ncircular flow of tax revenue i.e. back-flow of tax revenue \n in the form of the Government expenditures on\neducation, health care, social welfare, subsidies etc. for the benefit of the\nhouseholds. \n\n \n\nThese benefits / facilities either form part of the income or\nsome expenditures to be incurred otherwise by the households.\n\n\nDue to such circular flow of taxes the net decrease in the saving\ncapacity of this sector will be less.\n\n\nSince the quantification of the services / facilities provide\nby the Govemment is difficult the measurement of net decrease in the saving\ncapacity of the households ( i.e. total taxes borne minus taxes flown fack )\nis equally difficult. \n\n \n\nThe redistributive effects of taxes ( particularly progressive\nincome and wealth taxes ) on savings depend upon the transformation of income\nand wealth from rich to poor or vice versa.\n\n\nIf the redistribution is in favour of the poor ( which is expected\nof a good tax system) it reduces the disparities of income and wealth\ndistribution.\n\n\nSuch transformation of income and wealth is supposed to affect\nsavings adversely because of the high propensity of the poor people to\nconsume.\n\n\nIf the redistribution favours the rich, the saving is expected to\nincrease as their marginal saving rate is supposed to be higher.\n\n\nHowever, in India, the following facts ( Refer Tables 1 to 4 )\nsubstantiate that the redistributive effects of taxation on inequalities\nhave been almost nil or insignificant  4.\n\n\n( a) increasing dominance of indirect taxes ( i.e. from 82.4 % of\ntotal tax revenue in 1980-81 to 86.4 % in 1987-88 ) ; ( b) low and declining\nshare of direct taxes borne / paid by households ( i.e. from 10.81 % of total\ntax revenue to 7.67 % during the reference period) ; ( c) various tax\nconcessions for specified savings and reduction in direct tax rates (\nincome and wealth taxes ) of higher income brackets; ( d) increasing share\nof financial assets ( savings ) in gross household savings i.e. from 39.37 %\nin 1980-81 to 51.24 % in 1987-88; ( e) increasing share of gross household\nsavings in gross domestic savings; ( f) the stable average Gini-Lorenz\nRatio after \" Third Plan \" and upto \" Sixth Plan\n\" i.e. about 0.30 of rural and 0.33 % of urban sectors.\n\n\nThus, accumulation of wealth is rather favoured which is conducive\n to the saving climate in the household sector.\n \n\n\n  Household sector contributes over 75% of the Gross\nDomestic Savings ( GDS ) in our country.\n\n\nThis sector also bears the major share of our tax burden ( both\ndirect and indirect ) which affects its savings potential.   \n\n\n \n\n\nThe various incentive provisions in tax laws relating to promotion\nof savings also channelise such savings in the desired directions. \n \n\n\n \n\n\nIf the distributive effect of taxes is in favour of the poor ( which\nis expected of a good tax system), it reduces the disparities of income and\nwealth distribution.   \n\n\n \n\n\nThe rapid growth of household savings, particularly in some\nspecified financial assets, can be largely attributed to various tax\nincentives provided under incometax and wealth-tax laws.  \n\n\n\n  Tax incentives cost to the Government in the matter of\nrevenue collections.   <*> line at bottom of column one, Page 723\n</*>\n\n\n  *  The author is Lecturer in Commerce, K.M.\nCollege, Delhi University, Delhi.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL",

{"text": "INDIAN CONSTITUTION AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION : AN ANALYSIS\nOF THEIR RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP   \n\n\n \n\n \n\nTHE RELATIONSHIP between the Indian Constitution and public\nadministration is reciprocal: they influence each other.\n\n\nThe Constitution provides the basic framework for public\nadministration.\n\n\nBureaucracies, the main instrument of public administration, may help\nthe Constitution to survive or undermine it by their actions.\n\n\nThis is so because bureaucracies are centres of power in their own\nright though not the dominant ones.\n\n\nThey are at once constraints on action and instruments of action.\n\n\nThe nature and purpose of their interfaces with other power centres\nand their respective clientele and their strategic relationships with\nexternal reference groups and the political elites influence their normative\nframework and standards of professionalism.\n\n\nIn this context, the Constitution provides a frame of reference,\ncertainly the most salient one.\n\n\nAs such, the character of public administration is influenced by\nmultiple sources and all of them are under the spell of the Constitution.\n\n\n\n CONSTITUTION AND FRAMEWORK OF GOVERNANCE \n\n \n\nThe Indian Constitution establishes a complex web of institutions\nproviding channels of accountability:\n\n\n1. An administrative system that is responsive to the public and\naccountable to the elected functionaries and operative within the bounds of\nlaw, the due process in particular;\n\n\n2. A hierarchical system in which administrative positions are\norganised in such a way that the top generalist administrators have a\ndominant role in policy-making; and \n\n\n3. An expert system backed by a plethora of professional\norganisations that are interfaced with generalist-based organisation, but\nclearly subordinate to the latter. \n\n \n\nThe Constitution provides the normative framework of governance.\n\n\nIt sets the rules of the game for the public policy process, for the\nformulation and administration of public policies.\n\n\nThe overall effect of the rules set by the Constitution is to\nfacilitate actions as well as limit the discretionary power available to\ngovernment officials.\n\n\nSome rules, as in the case of specified rights of the citizen,\nprohibit officials from acting in a contrary direction.\n\n\nThe Constitution also sets a number of political veto points in the\npolicy process.\n\n\nThe federal structure and judiciary set other structural limits.\n\n\nThe limits to discretionary power are intended to discourage\nself-seeking behaviour of public officials and the unfair, arbitrary or\nexploitative use of coercive power against the citizenry.\n\n\nThe Constitution also prescribes limits to government power to\nprevent policy errors that impose unanticipated costs on the citizens.\n\n\nRules are also developed as a means of coping with uncertainty and to\nmake officials accountable for their actions.\n\n\nThe notion that constitutional legitimacy for public administration\nis extensive, subject to its operation within the framework, needs\nrecognition. \n\n \n\nDoes a highly centralised administrative state flow from the\nconstitutional imperatives?\n\n\nThe Constitution does legitimise an activist State and one that is\nhighly welfarist, if not socialistic, the latter being a later addition.\n\n\nThere is also a clear mandate for solving many public problems\nemergining in a multi-ethnic society.\n\n\nIn the economic and social spheres, it is not expected to be a\nminimal government.\n\n\nIn the social sphere, its role is vital as a consensus-builder.\n\n\nHaving gone through the colonial phase of authority and the\nIndependence movement, the framers of the Constitution were not intent upon a\ncentralised administrative State.\n\n\nConsent and consensus were to be the basic ingredients.\n\n\nThe Constitution also provides for equity: all parties should have\nrelatively equal access to the decision-making process in public\nadministration.\n\n\nIt implies that public administration must be responsive to public\ninterest in a broad sense.\n\n\nEquality under law is ensured.\n\n\nSo is the centrality of human dignity.\n\n\nThe Constitution emphasises a mix of values to guide public\nadministration to ensure that it is human, democratically responsive and\nefficient.\n\n\nThe values are not hierarchically ordered.\n\n\nThe goal of trying to make public administration legitimate through\nimplementation of efficiency measures tends to often conflict with\nrepresentativeness goals or the imperatives of political and social\nmobilisation. \n\n \n\nThe Indian Constitution did not explicitly suggest anywhere the\nspecific option as to whether the government should be an economic regulator,\nan economic administrator, or an economic player.\n\n\nAs a regulator, it is an umpire refereeing the behaviour of competing\ninterests by applying specific sets of rules.\n\n\nThe design and application of a particular set of rules would,  however, have specific policy outcomes.\n\n\nControls on monopolies, licensing, imports and exports are examples\nof such rules.\n\n\nAs an economic administrator, the government executes directly some\noperations, applying particular decision criteria and following set\nprocedures.\n\n\nAs an economic player, it pursues specific outcomes on a case-by-case\nbasis, putting together packages of incentives and disincentives, some\npersuasive and others coercive.\n\n\nIn shaping particular outcomes or preferring some sponsors over\nothers, it exercises discretionary power.\n\n\nOver the years, the Governmment chose to play all the three roles.\n\n\nThe transformational character of the State provided scope for an\nactivist public administration. \n\n \n\nAs the provider of public services to citizens, public\nbureaucracies can determine the character of government to a significant\nextent.\n\n\nThey are instruments by which government serves or burdens citizens.\n\n\nIndirectly, the limits on administrative discretion help to limit the\ndiscretion of political leaders to impose costs on citizens or in making\nattempts to enrich themselves. \n\n\n UPHOLDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL IMPERATIVES: SOME RECENT MAJOR CASES\n\n\n\n  Bofors Gun Case  \n\n \n\nThe framers of the Constitution were committed to efficiency in\ngovernment, but they loathed corruption more than they loved efficiency.\n\n\nAs a result, they shaped the rules for administering Indian\nbureaucracy in ways that restrain its discretionary power.\n\n\nThe focus is on ethics in government, on the part of both politicians\nand officials.\n\n\nEthics in government has several dimensions: ethics as personal\nhonesty and integrity, ethics as fairness toward others, ethics as respect\nfor others, and ethics as a commitment to diligence and excellence in\nperforming  work.\n\n\nThe architects of the Indian Constitution, most of whom had wide\nexposure to the Gandhian values, expected both the political elite and the\ncivil servants to be guided by formal accountability requirements as well as\ninternalised moral restraints as a decisive check on abuses of political\nauthority and administrative discretion.\n\n\nOn the issue of relations between political executives and civil\nservants, the Constitution does not display the flavour of  \"\npolitics-administration dichotomy\"  , but it recognises the\nneutrality of the civil service so that the political masters have access to\nsources of independent assessment, advice and policy guidance.\n\n\nCollusion or  quid pro quo  deals of any type between\ncontiguous functionaries are definitely not expected.\n\n\nThe Bofors gun controversy and the Stock Exchange-Bank Scam (\nreferred hereafter as Stock Scam) are two recent illustrations which provide\nample evidence for reflection on the extent to which the imperatives of the\nConstitution are upheld. \n\n \n\nThe Bofors gun controversy provides an instance of how the\nframework of rules set by the Constitution were flouted.\n\n\nBetween 1982 and 1985, the Army headquarters had on six occasions\nrated Sofma, the French gun, higher  than Bofors.\n\n\nWith a new incumbent as the Chief of the Army, the Army headquarters\nfor the first time, in early 1986, placed Bofors gun above Sofma and that too\nwithout preparation of a detailed matrix of marks.\n\n\nThe file moved quickly, thanks to the connivance of key bureaucrats.\n\n\nThe Prime Minister took a decision in favour of the Bofors gun.\n\n\nHis approval of the contract signed with Bofors ( March, 1986) was\nnot covered by sanction by the President of India as required under Article\n77 of the Constitution.\n\n\nThe decision on the Bofors contract was also not placed before the\nCabinet Committee on Political Affairs.\n\n\nOnce the Swedish radio broadcast about the payment of a commission to\nagents, diversionary efforts and ingenious attempts at a cover-up of evidence\nstarted.\n\n\nIn response to criticisms inside and outside Parliament, the Prime\nMinister went on to shift his stand from one occasion to another.\n\n\nFirst, the existence of a middleman / agent and payment of a\ncommission were flatly denied.\n\n\nThe payment, if any, by Bofors was termed winding-up charges.\n\n\nLater, the payment was stated to be for working expenses.\n\n\nStill later, it was conceded that Bofors paid commission, but no\nIndian was involved.\n\n\nSubsequently, it was stated that the Government had no knowledge of\nthe person or persons involved in receiving commission.\n\n\nThe Government of India did not act on the suggestion of the Indian\nMission in Sweden to have an audit of the entire gamut of transactions of\nIndia with Bofors by Indian Audit authorities.\n\n\nNor did the Government of India seek assistance from its Swedish\ncounterpart.  1\n\n\nAttempts to cover up this scandal were evident from the fact that for\nabout a year the relevant files were not made available by the Government for\naudit to the Comptroller & Auditor-General of India.\n\n\nThe Joint Parliamentary Committee ( JPC) submitted a report which\nexposed nothing.\n\n\nThen there was delay in tabling the Comptroller &  report before the Parliament, in early 1989.\n\n\nFurther, the authority of Parliament itself was undermined by the\nrefusal of the Presiding Officers to permit debate on important matters\nconcerning public probity or by their resorting to wholesale expunction of\nproceedings.\n\n\nGeneral Sundarji, in one of his interviews, refers to the  \"\ncrumbling processes affecting institutions\"  , other than the Army.\n 2\n\n\nThe Attorney  brief to the JPC does not reflect the\nrole he is expected to perform under the Constitution.\n\n\nHis role was in startling contrast with that of the Comptroller &\nAuditor-General.\n\n\nAs Cushrone Irani of the  Statesman  observes: \n\n \n\nThe return of  Rs.  64  crore  is\nnot the issue.\n\n\nThe central issue is that since April 1987 this \nleadership have lied to the elected representatives of our people in\nParliament and have lied repeatedly. \n\n\nElsewhere in the democratic world, lying to Parliament is a crime\nworse than murder.\n\n\nThe penalty is not merely death; it is dishonour.\n\n\nDemocratic governments are founded on the trust and confidence of\nthe people they govern.\n\n\nBluff, bluster and worse are not acceptable substitutes.  3\n\n\n\n  Stock Scam Case  \n\n \n\nThe mid - 1992, Stock Scam is yet another instance of\ngovernmental inaction, if not a cover-up.\n\n\nThe Scam was not caused by old-fashioned accounting procedures or by\na lack of computers.\n\n\nForgeries, falsehoods and illegal favours siphoned off public money\ninto private hands but our equanimity was not ruffled for long.\n\n\nThe doctrine of ministerial responsibility, a focal point of the\nparliamentary system, was not invoked.\n\n\nGoing by Indian democratic norms of the pre-Indira Gandhi era, at\nleast four Ministers should have quit the Union Council of Ministers.\n\n\nOnly one Minister, whose culpability in the crime was not\nestablished, left the Government.\n\n\nBofors and the Stock Scam drive home the point that the electoral\nprocess provided under the Constitution does not by itself provide sufficient\nchecks on abuse of discretionary power.\n\n\nThe weakness is perhaps germane to a Parliamentary system which,\nwhile providing for a strong executive, disallows continuous checks and\nbalances of the Presidential model. \n\n\n  Violations of Human Rights  \n\n \n\nDay in and day out, our conscience is shocked by news of the\nviolation of human rights.\n\n\nThe admission by the Union Home Minister and the Minister for\nInternal Security that the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities ( Prevention)\nAct ( TADA) has often been misused by state governments confirms what is\nalready known.\n\n\nThe statistics revealed by the National Human Rights Commission are\nmind-boggling.\n\n\nOf a total of 65,000 cases, Gujarat leads with 19,000, followed by\nPunjab 17,000, Jammu & Kashmir 10,000 and Andhra Pradesh 8,900.\n\n\nInterestingly, 95 per cent of the cases registered under TADA had\nbeen rejected by the courts.\n\n\nIf the rate of convictions under the Act is merely five per cent,\nthe statute can scarcely be said to have been judiciously used. \n\n \n\nWomen activists have been repeating allegations of atrocities\nagainst women.\n\n\nRemember the incident in Surat about an year ago when women were\ngangraped and killed in what literally was a blaze of light focused on them.\n\n\nWe were all duly horrified; some demands were made for apprehension\nand punishment of the culprits.\n\n\nThat was the end of the matter.\n\n\nMore recently, Miss Katia, a French tourist, was subjected to a\nsimilar horror is Chandigarh, allegedly by the grandson of the Chief Minister\nof Punjab.\n\n\nThe  cruelties and mental torture\nperpetrated against women reflect the vulnerabilities not merely of Indian\nwomen, but of the Indian democratic system.\n\n\nCountless number of  Harijan  women have been victims\nof atrocities by caste Hindus.\n\n\nMost of the time, the culprits go scotfree.\n\n\nWe allowed the Surat and Chandigarh events to pass us by even as we\nallowed the 1947 killings, the 1984 killings in Delhi and other cities, the\nkillings and blasts in Bombay in 1992-93, and the atrocities against poor\nwomen to pass us by.\n\n\nThe administrative system is becoming increasingly insensitive to\nevil by taking shelter under the complex maze of laws.\n\n\nThere is little realisation that it is not sufficient if we perform\nour duty; more important, however, is the purpose behind every duty. \n\n\n SOME DISTURBING TRENDS \n\n\n  Dismissals of Elected Governments  \n\n \n\nThe founding fathers of the Constitution worked out a federal\npolity as part of an accommodative framework to meet the problems of\nethnolinguistic diversity and to provide greater responsiveness to local\nrequirements.\n\n\nMany of the deviations and distortions that took place in the\nfederal system, especially since the late 1960s, are now too well-known.\n\n\nNot only has power been centralised in New Delhi, but also\nlegitimately elected State Governments are dismissed and brought under its\nown authority through  rule.\n\n\nThe result is an increasing, almost pathological imbalance, in the\nrelationship between the Centre and the states.\n\n\n federal system, which was once able to\ncompartmentalise social unrest, with political problems often containable\nwithin state boundaries, has of late been weakening with the state leaders\nrushing to Delhi and crowding New  corridors of power to find\nsolution of problems pertaining to their state.\n\n\nWhen demands for autonomy of sub-regions within States are on the\nincrease, it is necessary to redress the balance between the Centre and the\nStates, put an end to the arbitrary dismissal of State Governments and\nimposition of  rule and arrange for a more equitable\nsharing of revenues.\n\n\nOtherwise, with the dynamic cross-play of diverse interests,\ngovernance becomes increasingly more complex, testing the threshold of New\nDelhi.  <3>   Relationships Between Political Elites and Some\nCivil Servants  \n\n \n\nThe other disturbing trend is reflected in the patron-client\nrelations emerging between the political elites and some civil servants.\n\n\nSeveral civil servants have acquired reputation that they have\nbecome part of the baggage of their political patrons.\n\n\nSuch nexus leads to wholesale abuse of authority, resulting in\ndeinstitutionalisation.\n\n\nIt makes a mockery of all tasks of equity and rectitude in\ngovernance.\n\n\nInstitutions that had a high standing in public image for their\nprobity are destroyed from within by these moral dwarfs.\n\n\nThe political virus spreads to investigative agencies which are the\nheart of  the national security system.\n\n\nThere are ample illustrations of the state criminal intelligence\nagencies, and even the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI) that go through\nthe motions of charge-sheeting one set of politicians for grave crimes and\nmisdemeanours when their opponents are in power only to withdraw the cases\npromptly soon after the roles are reversed.\n\n\nWithdrawal of criminal cases, following a change in the party in\npower, smacks of a pre-democratic, feudal approach.\n\n\nThe practice has few parallels in the democratic world; it destroys\nfaith in public order and saps the morale of the police and other\ninvestigative agencies. \n\n \n\nTwo other disturbing trends of major deviations from the\nconstitutional norms are often cited.\n\n\nThe ubiquity of persons with a shady past dominating the composition\nof the political class and the rising tide of electoral and other forms of\nviolence are visible phenomena.\n\n\nThere have been attempts by mafia-type gangs to demand extortion or\nprotection money, to bribe or terrorise civil servants and police and their\nability to gain immunity from the law since the gangs enjoy the protection of\npowerful politicians, including legislators and Ministers.\n\n\nThere are mafias connected with illegal mining, timber trade,\nillicit liquor distilling, smuggling, etc.\n\n\nThe criminal-politicians nexus helps the latter in committing\nelectoral malpractices ranging from terrorising voters to rigging and\nbooth-capturing.\n\n\nUnder the impact of black money, powerful politicians are assured of\nfinanciers and a private army of election agents and political mobilisers.\n\n\nWith the increasing influx of criminals into politics, the process\nof  \" criminalisation of politics and politicisation of criminals\"\n has been facilitated.    1\n\n\nSee Chitra

{"text": "Revenue Audit Programme  and procedure\n  \n\n\nSANJAY CHHABAN ADHAV  *  <*> line from left to right</*>  <*> line from left to tight</*>  \n\n \n\n  REVENUE   Audit is a recent\ndevelopment in the field of audit of financial institutions, especially\nbanks.\n\n\nItis a special type of audit undertaken by banks to detect the leakage\n( if any ) in income.\n\n\nAll items of revenue and expenditure are scanned, leakages and\nabnormalities, if any, are detected and corrective measures taken.\n\n\nFurther, it is ensured that only legitimate charges are passed on to\nclients and they are not unnecessarily penalised.\n\n\nThus, the entire audit focus is on revenue.\n\n\nBeing a specialised type of audit it casts certain responsibilities\nwhich auditors are supposed to fulfil.\n\n\nThe aspects which are to be looked into while conducting the audit\nare briefly touched upon in this paper.\n\n\nAlso a detailed procedure to be followed while conducting the audit\nis given. \n\n \n\nThe items which come on the expenditure side and revenue side\ninclude the following, but not necessarily limited to them. \n\n\n  Expenditure  \n\n\n  Interest Paid / Payable on Deposits   - - Savings\ndeposits - - Current deposits - - Fixed deposits - - Recurring deposits - -\nVarious investment schemes\n\n\n  Other Expenditure  ( Major ones )  - - Salary and\nbonus - - Rent and taxes - - Depreciation - - Repairs and Maintenance - -\nElectricity, water and other amenities - - Other administrative expenses.\n\n\n  Revenue  \n\n\n Interest on Loans and Advances \n\n\nNormally loans and advances are of following types: - - Cash credit -\n- Bank overdraft - - Hypothecation loan - - Hire purchase loan - - Property\nloan - - Gold loan - - Personal loan - - Others, if any\n\n\n  Bank Commission Charges  \n\n\nUsually bank charges Commission on following items: - - Bills for\ncollection - - Inland bills purchase - - Bank Guarantee - - Letter of Credit\n- - Demand draft/Payslip/Payorder - - Locker rent.\n\n\n  Miscellaneous  \n\n \n\nBanks provide certain services for its clients / customers for\nwhich it charges certain fees / commission / service charges.\n\n\nA few of such items are given below: - - Accepting income-tax\ncha1lans - - Water, electricity, and telephone bills - - Purchasing and\nselling securities and properties - - Paying LIC premium directly - - Any\nother service as prevalent and directed by customer. \n\n \n\nThe names given to various books / registers and the contents\ntherein may change according to the needs, circumstances and policy of the\nbank. \n\n \n\nA brief summary of the procedure to be followed in conducting\nthe revenue audit is enumerated below.\n\n\nFirstly, the items of expenditure are dealt with. \n\n\n  Savings Deposit  \n\n \n\nIt is maintained by small earners.\n\n\nThere are certain restrictions on the number of withdrawals.\n\n\nPresently two withdrawals per week, i.e. maximum eight in a month are\nallowed.\n\n\nCare should be taken while conducting the audit that this norm is\nadhered to.\n\n\nIf not, the policy of the bank on this matter is to be seen.\n\n\nAs per RBI notification presently 5 % interest is paid on the minimum\nbalance between the 1Oth and 30th ( or 31st ) day.\n\n\nCooperative banks usually pay 1 % more than the rate prescribed by\nRBI.\n\n\nlnterest is paid half-yearly during December and June, i.e. for the\nperiod June to November in the month of December and for the period\nDecember to May in the month of June. \n\n \n\nThe minimum balance between the 1Oth and 30th day of each month\nis noted and the product for half yearly period is calculated.\n\n\nTo this product the applicable rate is applied.\n\n\nIt is easier to calculate the interest, if, first the interest on one\nrupee for one month is calculated.\n\n\nHalf-yearly interest can be easily calculated by multiplying the\nproduct with the amount of interest so calculated.\n\n\nIf the cheques, if any, are returned without clearance it should be\nnoted that cheque return charges is applied. \n\n\n  Fixed Deposits  \n\n\nUsually the following books are kept: a) Balancing book ( Cut-book )\n b) Fixed deposit ledger c) Savings account\nregister d) Payables register e) Supplementary register ( Interest on\ndeposit supplementary ) .\n\n \n\na)  Balancing book  gives the balances on a\nparticular day usually in January and June.\n\n\nHerein is mentioned only the principal value of FDR.\n\n\nDetails such as ledger number, FDR receipt number and principal\namount is mentioned in this book. \n\n \n\nb)  Fixed deposit ledger  gives the full details,\nviz, FDR Nos., Name of the holder, issue date, maturity date, period for\nwhich FDR is taken, rate of interest, whether interest is payable monthly\nor quarterly or on maturity.\n\n\nIf payable on maturity, whether with simple or compound interest.\n\n\nWhether interest is payable in cash or transferred to savings account\nor loan account in case under lien is also mentioned in the ledger. \n\n \n\nc)  Savings account register  gives details such as\nFDR No., name of the party, account No. of the party, interest paid\nquarterly / half-yearly. \n\n \n\nd)  Payable Register  gives the amount of interest\npayable to the party upto a particular day, usually on quarterly or\nhalf-yearly or at the close of the accounting year.\n\n\nCare is to be taken to ensure that correct provision is made taking\ninto consideration the period and rate of interest ( simple or\ncompound) as applicable. \n\n \n\ne)   Supplementary book ( Interest on deposit\nsupplementary )  \n\n\nAmount payables upto a particular quarter is recorded in payable\nregister.\n\n\nHowever, if the FDR matures between the two quarters, then the amount\npaid for this period is recorded in this book.\n\n\nThe amount payable is the difference between the quarterly interest\npayable and the interest paid earlier for the broken period.\n\n\n( Broken period means the number of days from the date of deposit\ntill the end of the quarter ) .\n\n\nIt may be noted that separate record is kept for interest paid in\ncash, payable on maturity, transferred to current a/c, transferred to cash\ncredit a/c, etc.\n\n\nAlso, a separate record for inter-branch transfer or transfer to\nseparate bank is maintained. \n\n\n  Audit Procedure  \n\n \n\nFrom the balancing book ( cut-book ) a random FDR number is\nselected.\n\n\nThis number is to be seen in a particular fixed deposit ledger\nwherein are given all the necessary details.\n\n\nAccording to the mode of payment, a particular book / register is to\nbe seen.\n\n\nIf the amount of interest is credited to savings account then it is\nto be seen whether the correct amount of interest is credited / recorded in\nsavings register.\n\n\nIf the amount is credited to current account or cash credit account,\nthen the entry in that particular register is to be seen.\n\n\nIf it is paid in cash or is transferred to account of the client in\nanother branch of the same bank or in account in another bank, entry in\nrespective registers is to be seen.\n\n\nIf the FDR matures between the quarters, then it is to be seen that\nthe interest paid for the remaining period is recorded in the supplementary\nregister. \n\n \n\nCare should be taken to note that correct rate of interest is\napplied taking into consideration the period for which the deposit is kept.\n\n\nFurther, it is to be seen that the calculated interest is correct and\nthere are no leakages. \n\n\n  Current Deposits  \n\n \n\nNormally no interest is paid on balances in current account\nthough RBI has prescribed O.5 %.\n\n\nThere are no restrictions on the number of withdrawals.\n\n\nWhile auditing current account it is to be seen whether bank\ncommission / charges and cheque return charges are correctly charged. \n\n\n  Recurring Deposit  \n\n \n\nThis is a special type of deposit wherein the depositor pays a\ncertain sum over a stipulated period.\n\n\nIf there are any late instalments penalty at the prescribed rate is\nto be levied.\n\n\nAfter maturity principal amount plus interest is paid.\n\n\nWhile applying the rate of interest, the period should be referred\nto.\n\n\nThe accounts which have matured during the year should be checked to\nensure that correct interest is paid.\n\n\n policy regarding closure of account before\nmaturity should be seen.\n\n\nProvision is required to be made for those accounts which have not\nmatured.\n\n\nlt is to be ensured that correct provision is made. \n\n\n  Investment Schemes  \n\n \n\nBefore conducting the audit, the specialities of such schemes\nshould be studied.\n\n\nIt is to be seen whether the provisions mentioned in various schemes\nare strictly adhered.\n\n\nAudit procedure of one scheme is explained below. \n\n\n  Reinvestment Cash Certificate / Cash Certificate\n \n\n \n\nUnder this scheme interest is paid along with the principal on\nmaturity.\n\n\nUsually interest is compounded - - monthly, quarterly or half-yearly.\n\n\nNormally following books are kept. \n\n \n\na)  Balancing Book  gives the balances on a\nparticular day, usually in January and June.\n\n\nThe accumulated value is specified in this. \n\n b)\n\n\n Accumulated Interest Register \n\n\nThe following details are given in this book: 1) Ledger Folio No. 2)\nCash Certificate Number 3) Name of the party 4) Issue and maturity date (\ni.e. period for which it is kept) 5) Percentage of interest 6) Principal\namount 7) Accumulated interest at the beginning of the year ( if any). 8)\nInterest required and provided during the year 9) Accumulated balance as at\nthe end of the year. \n\n c)   Ledger:  ( i.e. Reinvestment cash certificate / cash\ncertificate ledger ) . \n\n\nThe following details are given in the ledger: 1)\n\n\nName of the party along with the address 2)\n\n\nCash Certificate No. 3)\n\n\nPeriod for which certificate is kept 4)\n\n\nRate of interest payable 5)\n\n\nPrincipal amount 6)\n\n\nInterest payable, if any, credited to the account during the\nyear.\n\n \n\nd)   Interest on Deposit Supplementary:  \n\n\nIf a particular cash certificate matures during the year and if\nthe same is claimed by the holder, then, the amount of interest paid is\nrecorded in this register, while the principal amount paid is recorded in a\nseparate supplementary maintained specifically for such schemes. \n\n\n  Audit Procedure  \n\n \n\nFirst select a random number in the   balancing book ( cut-book ) which you desire to check.\n\n\nLocate that particular number in the accumulated interest\nregister.\n\n\nOn the basis of the information given in the register\ncalculate the interest payable.\n\n\nWhile doing so care should be taken to see that correct rate of\ninterest is applied taking into consideration the period for which the amount\nhas been invested.\n\n\nSee that the calculated interest is correct and discrepancies, if\nany, should be noted and get rectified.\n\n\nOn the basis of the folio number given see that account in the\nledger.\n\n\nCross verify the principal amount, period and rate of interest.\n\n\nVerify that correct interest is credited to the account in the\nledger.\n\n\nAlso verify that the amount of interest payable mentioned in the\naccumulated interest register is debited to the profit and loss account (\ndebit ) supplementary. \n\n\n  Other Expenditure  \n\n \n\nInterest on deposits has been described above.\n\n\nIt constitutes one of the important items of expenditure.\n\n\nStrict vigilance on this item should be maintained.\n\n\nAlong with this item certain other items of major expenditure\nshould be checked.\n\n\nSome of the important items of expenditure are:\n\n\n  Salary  \n\n\nFirst obtain the details pertaining to salaries.\n\n\nMethod of calculating fixed DA and variable DA should be noted.\n\n\nVarious allowances are payable to the employees, such as cash\nallowance, teller allowance, key allowance, post allowance, medical\nallowance, attendance bonus, cycle allowance, washing allowance.\n\n\nHRA and travelling allowance.\n\n\nAllowances payable differ according to the category of the\nemployee.\n\n\nThe rates of all these allowances should be obtained.\n\n\nAnnual increment if any given should also be seen.\n\n\nIn case of promotions, promotion letter and the resultant\nincrease in salary should be seen.\n\n\nAny individual variation in salary from that of earlier month should\nbe noted.\n\n\nThe salary for the entire year should be compared with that of the\nearlier year and the reason(s) behind the variation should be seen. \n\n \n\n  Audit Procedure  \n\n\n  Steps  \n\n\n1) See the muster, test-check in the case of few employees the\nnumber of days he was present.\n\n\nIf the employee is absent see whether the leave is with pay or\nwithout pay.\n\n\nIf it is with pay, then salary will be paid even for the leave\nperiod and vice-versa. \n\n \n\n2) Check the amount of basic pay, compare it with earlier\nperiod, notice variation(s) if any and obtain the reasons justifying the\nvariation.\n\n\nCalculate DA ( fixed and variable ) as per the formula given.\n\n\nCalculate the various allowances that are payable to the employee.\n\n\n \n\n3) Verify whether the total gross salary payable to all\nemployees is debited to profit and loss account, and deductions, if any,\ntherefrom, are properly recorded in the respective account. \n\n \n\n4) See whether signature of the employees is obtained on the\nsalary sheets on revenue stamp. \n\n \n\n5) Verify whether the salary and allowances payable is duly\nsanctioned by the competent authority. \n\n \n\n6) Any major variation in the salary bill should by dealt in\ndepth and reasons justifying the same should be sought. \n\n \n\n  Repairs and Maintenance  \n\n\nVerify the major items of expenditure.\n\n\nSee that no item of expenditure of capital nature is charged to\nprofit and loss account.\n\n\nIf any capital expenditure is shown as revenue then the same\nshould be rectified. \n\n \n\n  Rent and Taxes  \n\n\nIf the premises of bank are on leave and licence basis verify the\namount of rent paid by the bank.\n\n\nSee that the stamped receipts of rent paid are obtained.\n\n\nIf there is any variation with the rent paid for earlier years, the\nreasons justifying the same should be seen.\n\n\nIf it is the first year of procuring the charge of premises then the\nagreement copy fixing the rate of rent should be seen.\n\n\nWhere premises are owned by the bank, receipt of tax paid to\nmunicipal authorities be seen. \n\n \n\n  Miscellaneous items  \n\n\nIn the case of telephone, postage, travelling and conveyance etc.\ncare should be taken to note that proper supporting record is maintained.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "ANTI-PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN INDIA   \n\n\n \n\n \n\nTHE USE of the term  ` Public Administration' \npresupposes a dominant mode of behaviour on the part of members of the state\nbureaucracy.\n\n\nThese bureaucrats are expected to safeguard the legitimate interests\nof the public by a ceaseless exercise of adequate vigilance and expertise.\n\n\nPublic administrators are to fulfil the lawful needs of the common\npeople by adoption and implementation of appropriate decisions without\ndiscriminating between the high and the low, the rich and the poor, as also\nbetween persons who possess administrative-political influence and others who\ndo not possess such influence.\n\n\nMembers of the state bureaucracy will, thus, promote professional\nexcellence and dignity, and justify the permanence of tenure as also numerous\nfacilities ( free from encumbrances and taxes) enjoyed by them ( especially\nthose in the higher echelons).\n\n\nUnfortunately, in India ( as in many other countries), most public\nservants have failed to live up to the faith reposed in them, and thus\nforfeited the eligibility for privileges heaped on them.\n\n\nConsequently, an ordinary Indian, bereft of any\nadministrative-political influence, is dismayed to find public administration\nin India reduced to anti-public administration.\n\n\nThe rationale for a permanent tenure for civil servants becomes very\nweak.\n\n\nThe case for a New Zealand-type bureaucracy, with even counterparts\nof Secretaries to the Government of India being appointed on short-term\nperformance-related contracts, becomes quite strong. \n\n\n  Anti-People Attitude of Bureaucracy  \n\n \n\nAn ordinary person may not at every moment be deeply aware of the\nanti-people characteristics of the entire state bureaucracy.\n\n\nFor, normally, a person does not have the misfortune to visit at the\nsame point of time a police station, a law court, a government hospital or\nschool, etc.\n\n\nConsequently, he may suffer from an illusion that all government\nagencies may not be anti-people.\n\n\nBut the harsh truth is, if one keeps out of account a few exceptional\nagencies and a few extraordinary persons in every agency, all government (\nand, to add, semi-Government) agencies are anti-people,  because they are manifestly reluctant to perform the minimum of duties\nin time.\n\n\nIt is largely because of the selfless and indefatigable efforts of\nthese exceptional agencies and functionaries that some citizens still retain\na bit of trust in the state bureaucracy. \n\n \n\nThe number of such extraordinary functionaries cannot but dwindle\nfast in a situation where, as in  Mandi Parishad  of Uttar\nPradesh recently, the Chief Engineer, insistent upon quality control in\npublic works, has been murdered by criminals thriving on nexus with\npoliticians and contractors.\n\n\nSuch honest officials, moreover, as long as they are alive, may\nremain thoroughly demoralised.\n\n\nSome of them take to academic / literary pursuits with great success,\nand obtain relief from demoralisation.\n\n\nOne even witnesses the sorry spectacle of honest police officers, who\nchafe at their inability to arrest druglords ( well-known to the police and\nthe public), and then proceed to perform the academic chore of addressing\nthousands of students in seminars on drug abuse.\n\n\nThus, unwittingly, these public-spirited officials further the\ninterests of druglords, because the majority of students, hitherto unaware of\nintoxicating drugs, become curious about them, and curiosity is frequently\nthe first faltering step to addiction. \n\n \n\nEndless and familiar are the ways in which an ordinary citizen,\nvisiting a state or semi-state agency in quest of a perfectly legitimate\nservice, is subjected to tremendous harassment and / or extortion.\n\n\nIndeed, he confronts a  Kafkaesque  bureaucracy.\n\n\nIt is a bureaucracy, steeped in the constitutionally prescribed creed\nof socialism, and members of the higher bureaucracy feel free to get their\npension papers processed in time, but do not suffer from qualms of conscience\nwhen they keep poor retired teachers of Government-aided schools waiting for\nyears, in case they are lucky to enjoy pension before death.\n\n\nIt is a great system of public administration, in which members of\nsuperior services ( e.g., Indian Administrative Service or the Indian Foreign\nService), having spouses in the same or allied services, spend a lot of time\nto ensure the posting of highly-paid couples in the same station, but do not\nbother about transferring a low-paid female attendant at the J. P. Hospital\nin Bhopal to a place 50 kilometers away, effectively separating her from the\nhusband and family. \n\n\n  Plethora of Rules and Regulations  \n\n \n\nIn a word, ordinary citizens cannot be blamed if their\npredominant experiences lead them to conclude that members of the state\nbureaucracy have been essentially trained to persecute the common people in\nan unfair manner.\n\n\nNumerous rules, regulations, etc., have been devised and refined for\nthis purpose.\n\n\nIt has been expected that adoption of modern technology will reduce\nsufferings caused by such regulations.\n\n\nBut the innovative capacities of Government functionaries in India\nare so great that they can even harness modern machines ( e.g., computers) to\nmultiply the sufferings of ordinary people.\n\n\nAt an office in a state capital, for instance, a tax-payer finds the\npublic servant at a counter sitting idle, because the computer at his\ndisposal  is out of order.\n\n\nHe, therefore, has to wait for an hour to transact a business that\nshould not take more than two or three minutes.\n\n\nHe further discovered that he has been able to get the job done,\nbecause, meanwhile, a more clever tax-payer has applied an ancient art to\nmake the allegedly immobile machine work.\n\n\nHe remunerates one of too many middlemen swarming the office\npremises, who use a major part of this remuneration to bribe the state\nfunctionary at the counter.\n\n\nThis functionary needs an incentive to overcome his sense of\nweariness born of too little work. \n\n\n  Indecision at Top Level of Politicians and Administrator\n \n\n \n\nBeyond such personal afflictions, ceaseless and numerous, lie the\nvast domain of enormous collective suffering imposed on helpless masses by\nthe failure of top level politicians-administrators to take, or even make\nsincere efforts to take, timely and proper decisions on important matters.\n\n\nFor example, one can pay some attention to the working of Forest\nDepartments in various states.\n\n\nThese departments can be easily equated to ultra-big and thoroughly\nirresponsible landlords.\n\n\nForest officials are entrusted with the supreme duty to harmonise\nthree aims.\n\n\nOne, they have to safeguard the legitimate, though limited, rights of\npoor forest dwellers to the use of forest products for sheer survival.\n\n\nTwo, they have to meet the essential demands of town dwellers and\nbusinessmen in compliance with well-defined and carefully planned\nregulations.\n\n\nThree, forest officials must exercise strict vigilance to ensure that\na thoughtless use of forest resources does not disrupt the \nenvironmental balance.\n\n\nNevertheless, despsite the lapse of 47 years since the achievement of\nIndependence in 1947, the state bureaucracy has not taken firm measures to\ncarry out any well-formulated plan in this immeasurably important field.\n\n\nThe inevitable consequence is, dishonest politicians, businessmen and\nofficials, taking advantage of the dire poverty of forest dwellers, have\nlaunched a virtual conspiracy to destroy  forest resources,\nand upset the overall environmental balance.\n\n\nIt may not be easy in the near future to uproot this conspiracy,\nbecause in a state like Uttar Pradesh ( rich in forest resources), an\nalarmingly large number of members elected to the legislature happen to be\nconvicted of serious crimes, or undertrial criminals.\n\n\nIn Karnataka, again, on account of evident collusion between\npoliticians, officials and a mafia group, timber worth one thousand \ncrore  of  rupees  has been illegally procured from\nforests in recent months, whereas the Chief Minister nonchalantly affirms\nthat his state is free from corruption. \n\n\n  Crimeproneness  \n\n \n\nIt is inordinately significant that legislators actively engaged\nin crimes or visibly dependent on criminals, not only persecute ordinary\nindividuals but also honest high-ranking officers ( whose number naturally\nregisters a rapid decline).\n\n\nEven those officials, who are ready to placate legislators by\nsacrificing ethics, cannot escape harassment in case they are not prepared to\n exercise their capacity for dishonesty beyond a\ncertain limit.\n\n\nThis may explain why ( as of 1994) a large number of District\nCollectors and Superintendents of Police ( notably in Bihar and Uttar\nPradesh) have been subjected to penal transfers every few months.\n\n\nMoreover, conscientious officials have ben witnesses to innumerable\ncases of promotion or transfer to highly important positions, which bear no\nreasonable relationship with the the performance and experience of\nbeneficiaries.\n\n\nActually, in some State secretariats, members of the higher\nbureaucracy are preoccupied with gossips about such postings and promotions.\n\n\nThey are undoubtedly wasting their time, but it may be dangerous on\ntheir part to devote themselves to more fruitful activities.\n\n\nFor, one of them may take an honest action without being able to\nanticipate how it can hurt the vital interests of a greedy, crime-prone\nlegislator.\n\n\nThe aggrieved legislator will surely retaliate by transferring the\nofficial concerned to a demonstrably less important post inside the\nSecretariat or to a place far away from the state capital. \n\n \n\nSuch penalties, however, are insignificant in comparison to what\nsome honest and competent civil servants have had to suffer on account of\ntheir determination to place professional ethics and public interest above\npersonal gains.\n\n\nFor example, some years back, an IAS probationer ( a close relative\nof the then Prime Minister of India, who practised divide-and-rule much more\nseriously but much less successfully than the British colonial rulers) was\nabused of molesting a lady probationer.\n\n\nThe chief of the training academy, also an IAS officer, submitted his\nletter of resignation in order to press the demand of exemplary punishment\nfor the accused male probationer.\n\n\nLargely on account of this moral pressure exerted by the training\nacademy chief, the government was forced to take a disciplinary action\nagainst the wayward IAS probationer.\n\n\nEventually, however, this disciplinary action was <unclear> inguished\n</unclear> by negligent and/or generous intervention.\n\n\nBut the government did not take any step to help the training academy\nchief, who resigned and incurred unwarranted financial loss.\n\n\nIn this context one cannot resist the temptation to remember the\nunbelievably anti-public stance of four <unclear> or </unclear> of five\nhighest judicial officers of India, who overruled the judgements of the High\nCourts in the 1970s, and upheld the Emergency law suspending the right to\nlife and liberty granted by Article 21 of the Constitution of India. \n\n \n\nHoodlums of a ruling party in south India have gone so far as to\nspray the face of a lady IAS officer with acid, beause this officer is not a\ndevotee of the cult of self-aggrandisement, and, therefore, takes some\nrightful decisions, which have hurt the vital interests of the ruling party.\n\n\nThe lady has resigned from the IAS.\n\n\nMoreover, even on matters not at all connected with the performance\nof regular administrative duties, an IAS officer, or his closest relative,\nmay suffer from severe oppression without any lapse on his or her part.\n\n\nThe oppressors - - politicians-turned-criminals or\ncriminals-turned-politicians - - evade all penal actions.\n\n\nIn one incident, on the <unclear> word </unclear> of a state capital,\nthe wife of an IAS officer is brutally molested by a well-known anti-social.\n\n\nBut some political leaders of the ruling party depend  vitally on this anti-social for winning elections.\n\n\nAfter all, an honest citizen can cast only one vote, whereas such an\nanti-social can cast numerous votes, and the police cannot come near him.\n\n\nIn another incident, an IAS officer, travelling by train, infuriates\na co-passenger, who is a Member of Parliament, surrounded by some companions,\nincluding legislators of a neighbouring state.\n\n\nHe gets furious, because the IAS officer opposes his forcible entry\ninto a reserved compartment without any valid reservation document.\n\n\nThe companions of the Member of Parliament, carrying fire-arms,\nmercilessly beat and insult the IAS officer, and try to force him out of the\ntrain at a station, obviously to take him to a secluded place, and murder\nhim.\n\n\nBy sheer luck and mental strength, the IAS officer escapes kidnapping\nand death.\n\n\nBut no action can be taken against the crime-prone parliamentarian\nand his trigger-happy musclemen-cum-legislators. \n\n\n  Debasing of Values  \n\n \n\nA number of to-pranking leaders of  Independence\nMovement were eminent lawyers.\n\n\nIt was certainly feasible in their part to devise\nlegal-constitutional measures to prevent politicians of the above-noted\ncategory, living on crimes or depending on criminals, from crowding\nlegislatures, or establishing predominance.\n\n\nBut, following Independence, the top-most leaders of the ruling party\n( as also the high-ranking officials of the state bureaucracy) chose not to\npay any attention to this serious problem.\n\n\nInstead, they concentrated their political-administrative endeavours\non the following aims: to ensure that one political party won electins for\ndecades, by fair means or foul; to endow a coterie within this party, a\nfamily within this coterie, and a person within the family, with unlimited\npowers.\n\n\nA widespread use of the slogan of  ` socialism'  ,\nsimultaneously tantalising and confusing the people, contributed immensely to\nthe acquisition and conservation of these powers.\n\n\nPolitical leaders were tactful; they never attempted the impossible\ntask of defining socialism.\n\n\nDeceptively pleasing announcements about the establishment of a\n \" socialistic pattern of society\"  - - or a reckless use of\nthe mask of socialism - - aided the above-noted process of over-concentration\nof powers. \n\n \n\nRemarkably, the high-ranking members of the state bureaucracy - -\ne.g., nearly all members of the ICS ( Indian Civil Service) and the IAS (\nIndian Administrative Service) - - extended enthusiastic cooperation to the\naccumulation of powers in the hands of a person / family / coterie within one\nruling party in New Delhi.\n\n\nMany of these officers pretended to be votaries or spokesmen of\nsocialism.\n\n\nThe reason was easy to fathom.\n\n\nThe practice of socialism meant, basically, a ceaseless expansion of\nthe powers of the state bureaucracy, as also of the privileges enjoyed by\npublic administrators, which had little or no relationship with their\nadministrative abilities, not to speak of a rise in the standard of living of\nthe masses.\n\n\nMoreover, as members of the state bureaucracy became more and more\npower-hungry and privilege-addict, they extended unflinching support to the\nthoroughly  illegitimate activities of their\npolitical bosses ( including gross financial irregularities ) .\n\n\nConsequently, in numerous public sector undertakings - - in city\ntransport or Indian Airlines, in steel or chemical plants, in the management\nof banks or generation of electricity - - the country has suffered from\nlosses worth hundreds of thousands of  crores  of rupees due\nto acts of wastage, inefficiency and corrpution that are stranger than\nfiction.\n\n\nTo take a dramatic example, 190 employees of a State-run Ceramic\nDevelopment Corporation have been enjoying salaries for a decade without (\nrepeat without ) doing any work.\n\n\nNo wonder that all this drives India to the verge of bankruptcy by\nthe end of 1980s. \n\n \n\nWhen top-most politicians-administrators remain preoccupied with\nself-aggrandisement, and misuse the apparatus of public administration for\nhis purpose, the country inevitably exposes itself to enconomic and other\ndisasters.\n\n\nFor, when national interests are subordinated to\npersonal-factional-party interest, appropriate decisions on momentous matters\nare not taken in time.\n\n\nA stitch in time saves nine.\n\n\nBut an overpowering fixation upon narrow personal / factional\nconcerns generates chronic shortsightedness in decision-making, and\ncomplicates problems in such an uncontrollable fashion that even nine\nstitches may not be of much avail.", "subdomain":

{"text": "Gamma-ray Astronomy : A Cosmic Quest      \n\n \n\n COSMIC  rays are tiny visitors\nfrom outer space that constantly keep impinging on the \natmosphere from all directions.\n\n\nThey comprise a host of highly energetic particles including protons,\nnuclei of heavier atoms, electrons, positrons and also gamma ray photons.\n\n\nNeutrions, which are supposed to be chargeless and massless\nparticles, predominate over all other particles by several orders of\nmagnitude but their energies are mainly low and it is extremely difficult to\ndetect them experimentally.\n\n\nThe study of cosmic rays is important because it has a strong\ninfluence on the terrestrial atmosphere, especially in the production\nof very high intensity radiation belts around the earth and ionisation in the\nlower atmosphere.\n\n\nIt also plays an important role in genetic mutations which may have\ninfluenced the course of organic evolution on the earth. \n\n \n\nAlthough cosmic rays were discovered in 1912, through the   pioneering balloon\nexperiments of the German scientist Victor F. Hess, all attempts to date\naimed at locating the sources of these particles have failed.\n\n\nIt was initially thought that the study of the directions from which\ncosmic rays arrive would enable us to localize the sources of these energetic\nparticles.\n\n\nBut it was later discovered that the matter was not so simple.\n\n\nIt was found that cosmic ray particles are affected by galactic\nmagnetic field which changes their direction of arrival on earth.\n\n\nSo the arrival direction at earth does not bear any relation with the\nactual source direction.\n\n\nVery low-energy cosmic ray particles are not greatly affected by\ngalactic magnetic field, but their level is so low that the available\nstatistics does not allow a meaningful search for localized regions of\nemission.\n\n\nIt is precisely because of these reasons that even major cosmic ray\nexperiments involving detectors with effective sizes of several square\nkilometres have failed to pinpoint any source of cosmic rays either within\nour galaxy or outside in the extragalactic space. \n\n \n\nThe first problem one encounters in  the\nsearch for the origin of cosmic rays involves deciding whether this\nradiation arises within our Milky Way galaxy ( also called the Galaxy,\nof which our solar system is a part) or has its sources outside.\n\n\nThe detection of radio synchrotron radiation, produced by the\ninteraction of cosmic ray electrons with the galactic magnetic field,\nsupernova remnants, pulsars, etc., indicates that cosmic ray electrons are\nmainly of Galactic origin.\n\n\nThe same argument, however, does not apply in the case of cosmic\nray nuclei as no definite Galactic source of protons and nuclei has been\ndiscovered so far.\n\n\nThis situation appears to have changed to some extent with the recent\nresults obtained from gamma-ray astronomy which suggest that several\nGalactic sources of high-energy protons and nuclei may have been discovered.\n\n\nProbably the best method of distinguishing between a Galactic and\nan extra-Galactic origin for cosmic rays is to search for what is called a\n \" radical cosmic ray density gradient\"  , which is\nexpected to be significant if cosmic rays originate within the Galaxy.\n\n\n \n\n GAMMA  ray astronomy provides\na reasonable accurate method of deriving the radial cosmic ray density\ngradient.\n\n\nHigh-energy gamma rays, with energy in the MeV ( Million electron\nvolt ) - GeV ( Giga electron volt ) range, are believed to result from the\ndecay of ( pi)mesons produced in the interactions of cosmic ray protons with\ninterstellar matter which essentially comprises atomic and molecular\nhydrogen.\n\n\nCosmic gamma-ray data obtained with satellite-borne detectors,\nlike those flown on the SAS - - II ( Small Astronomy Satellite ) and the\nCOS-B ( Cosmic Ray Satellite ) satellites can be used to give a radial\ndistribution from which the cosmic ray distribution within the galaxy can be\ncomputed.\n\n\nInspite of some limitations inherent in this procedure, a detailed\n  analysis of satellite\ngamma-ray data has shown the presence of a significant cosmic ray radial\ndensity gradient.\n\n\nThis indicates that the bulk of cosmic rays, or at least those which\nare responsible for the generation of gamma-ray in the MeV-GeV energy range,\nare galactic in origin.\n\n\nHowever, this procedure does not provide any indication of specific\ncosmic ray sources, a subject on which information is again sought through\ngamma-ray observations, though, at higher energies. \n\n \n\nThere is an intimate connection between cosmic gamma-ray\nstudies and the problem of cosmic ray origin.\n\n\nIt is generally believed that high-energy gamma-rays result from the\ninteractions of energetic charged particles with the electromagnetic\nfields and matter pervading the inter-stellar medium, the dominant\nprocesses being <*> pie </*> decay, synchrotron process and inverse\ncompton effect, etc.\n\n\nDue to their high penetrating power and charge neutrality, cosmic\ngamma-rays can arrive at the earth from almost any part of the Galaxy without\nany appreciable absorption and without any deflection in the galactic\nmagnetic field.\n\n\nThis opens up the possibility of the detection of discrete sources\nof gamma-rays by employing suitable experimental techniques.\n\n\nAs gamma-ray sources must also produce copious amounts of\nenergetic charged particles, the detection of such sources provides the\nonly method to identify discrete sources of cosmic rays.\n\n\nIt is mainly because of this promise that a  lot  of attention has been paid to very high-energy cosmic\ngamma-ray astronomy during the last two decades or  so and some very important results have been obtained. \n\n \n\n APART  from satellite-borne\ndetectors, which detect energetic gamma-rays directly, two ground-based\ntechniques have also been developed for gamma-ray astronomy.\n\n\nThese are the atmospheric Cerenkov technique and the air shower array\ntechnique, which can detect gamma-rays of energy ranging from 1011\nto 1014 eV and above.\n\n\nIn both the methods, the  atmosphere is used as an\nenergy transducer   wherein the primary photon or nucleon energy is converted into a cascade\nof electrons, positrons, muons, hadrons and photons, etc, through a series of\ninteractions ( Fig.2).\n\n\nAt primary energies greater than 1014 eV, most of the\nsecondary particles survive absorpotion in the atmosphere and can be detected\nat high altitudes by employing a widely disposed array of particle detectors.\n\n\nThe difference in the relative arrival times of the particles at the\nvarious detectors can be used to derive the direction of the primary cosmic\nray particles with reasonable accuracy.\n\n\nIdentification of potential cosmic ray sources is then sought by\nlooking for anisotropies in the arrival directions and by conducting\ndetailed investigations of the source regions at other wavelength bands\nof the magnetic spectrum.\n\n\nAs they move through the atmosphere the primary particles produce\nsecondary particles in a process called  ` air shower'  .\n\n\nThese particles lose a part of their energy through the Cerenkov\nprocess.\n\n\nThe visible photons thus produced mainly in the wavelength band\n300-5000 A can be detected at the ground level as narrow pulses with suitable\nmirror-photomulti-plier tube systems.\n\n\nThis provides an efficient method of detecting 1011 -\n1014 eV cosmic ray primaries at ground.\n\n\nThis so-called atmospheric Cerenkov technique has been used\nextensively for cosmic gamma-ray studies.\n\n\nThe Bhabha Atomic Research Centre has been operating such a system\nat Gulmarg ( Kashmir).\n\n\nA similar though larger system has been operated by the Tata\nInstitute of Fundamental Research at Ooty for several years and has now been\nshifted to Pachmarhi in Madhya Pradesh.\n\n\nHowever, these techniques are unable to distinguish between\nextensive air shower events initiated by primary cosmic ray particles and\nthose produced by gamma-rays.\n\n\nThe principal characteristics of the two types of showers are\nessentially identical and it poses a real challenge to separate the extremely\nsmall gamma ray signal from the rather overwhelming background of the\ncharged particle initiated events.\n\n\nSeveral techniques, based on the subtle though experimentally\ndistinguishable differences between the two types of showers have been tried\nwith moderate success. \n\n \n\n  DURING   the last twenty years\nor so, gamma-ray astronomy studies in the Very High Energy ( VHE =\n1011 - 1013 eV ) and the Ultra High Energy ( UHE =\n1014 - 1017 eV) bands using ground-based techniques have\nidentified a number of potential, discrete cosmic ray sources in the\nGalaxy.\n\n\nThese  ` sources'  represent two distinct types of\nstellar populations, namely isolated fast pulsars and binary x-ray sources\ninvolving compact primaries ( like black holes, neutron stars, and white\ndwarfs ) .\n\n\nA distinguishing feature of the observed gamma-ray emission from\nthese  ` sources'  is the variability of the emission and\nthe modulation of the gamma-ray signal with a period characteristic of the\nsystem, viz., the rotation period in the case of pulsars and the orbital\nperiod in the case of binary x-ray source.\n\n\nWhile     the Crab pulsar (\nPSR0531 + 21) and the Vela pulsar ( PSR 0833 - 45) represent typical examples\nof the first type, the binary x-ray sources Cygnus X-3, Her X - 1 and Vela X\n- 1 represent typical examples of the second type of the galactic gamma-ray\nemitting objects.\n\n\nIn addition to these five sources, a number of pulsars, x-ray\nbinary systems and extragalactic objects ( like the radio galaxy Cen-A)\nhave also been reported by at least one observatory to emit VHE and UHE\ngamma-ray signals. \n\n \n\nIt would be in order to sound a note of caution at this stage.\n\n\nThe high-energy cosmic rays that are presently observed at the earth\nare probably unrelated to any of the VHE and UHE gamma-ray sources discussed\nso far.\n\n\nThe magnetic field of the Galaxy prevents their direct journey from\nthe source to the observer.\n\n\nThe propagation of UHE / VHE cosmic rays through the Galaxy is a\ndiffusive process which takes much longer than the life-time of any of the\nsources discovered so far.\n\n\nCosmic ray production in this scenario is a dynamic process with many\nsources contributing at any time for comparatively brief epochs during their\nevolution.\n\n\nIt may be kept in mind, though, that the nature of the primary\nparticle detected in UHE / VHE gamma-ray astronomy is uncertain at present\nand only follows from a process of elimination of all other possibilities.\n\n\nBetter and bigger experiments in future, incorporating systems for an\nunambiguous identification of the primary particle, will go a long way in\npinpointing the exact sources of cosmic rays and thus help in the\nunderstanding of the fundamental problems of cosmic ray acceleration and\npropagation.  <*> line below </*> \n\n\nR.

continuous collision with each other formed life.\n\n\nThe basic energy for activating these reactions and the prolific\npower of carbon to form chain compounds helped in the formation of the first\namino acid and gradually the cell more than 3.5 billion years ago.\n\n\nFurther development of organism and the society of organisms was\nfacilitated by enrichment of the originally salt-less waters.\n\n\nAs time passed, geysers and eruptions brought vast quantities of\nminerals into the sea through rivers and springs. \n\n \n\nThe primeval organisms were dominantly ancleated forms which\noccupied shallow sloping environments.\n\n\nThese forms, both with and without the capacity to make their own\nfood, dominated  biosphere during the first two billion years\nof its history. \n\n \n\nThe earliest organisms were chemoheterotrophs absorbing\nnecessary nutrients from the surrounding water.\n\n\nThe next organisms that appeared were chemoautotrophs.\n\n\nThey obtained their energy by degradation of chemical compounds for\nthe synthesis of food molecules.\n\n\nThese organisms are found in the Galapagos and in deep ocean\nthermal springs.\n\n\nAnalysis of the biological inter-relationship around these\nsprings suggests that geothermally produced hydrogen sulfide is the\nbasic energy source used by chemoautotrophic bacteria to fix carbon.\n\n\nThese bacteria not only make their basic food resource but also\nform the first step in the food chain.\n\n\nFossilized remains of   Thiobacillus  \nand some members of Siderocapsaceae which can reduce sulphate are known from\nover 2.66 billion years old Kudremukh iron ore deposits.\n\n\nGradually microbes diversified in many low-lying mud\ncommunities.\n\n\nCells acquired the capability to carry out numerous metabolic\nstrategies, including fermentation,   sulphate reduction and anaerobic photosynthesis.\n\n\nIt was the appearance of a molecule called chlorophyll  \" a\"\n , the mediator of photosynthesis, and its incorporation in\nprokaryotic organism known as Cyanobacteria ( blue-green algae) which\ntriggered important changes in the atmosphere.\n\n\nA convenient contrivance serving this purpose was the conversion of\ncarbon dioxide into carbohydrates.\n\n\nFrom the stand point of energy it is affected most economically by\nthe photosynthetic activity of these cyanobacteria.\n\n\nThese autotrophic life forms were able to synthesize organic matter\nfrom carbon-dioxide and water with molecular  oxygen released as a metabolic byproduct.\n\n\nThe ultimate result of these changes in the atmosphere was far\nreaching for a living system.\n\n\nCyanobacteria represent the highest level of evolution in the kingdom\nMonera.\n\n\nThey generated oxygen photosynthetically and appeared in the\nArchaean.\n\n\nWhen the oxygen level started rising, chemical and biological\nstrategies to cope up with this new situation had to be adapted.\n\n\nMany organisms, unable to tolerate the toxicity of this gas, were\npermanently driven to anaerobic niches while others first developed\ntolerance, then facultative use and eventually the obligate use of\noxygen in metabolism.  \n\n\nThis oxygen, a result of photolysis of water during the\nphotosynthetic process, accumulated and led to the evolution of\nrespiring bacteria.\n\n\nThese symbiotic forms probably got merged with other bacteria and\nformed eukaryotic cells which through the course of evolution became\nmulticellular and gave rise to fungi, plants and animals. \n\n \n\nThe first eukaryotes were probably primitive protists - - aerobic\naquatic unicellular organisms whose patterns of cell division and life cycle\ncan vary from one species to another.\n\n\nThe fossil acritarchs and vase-shaped microfossils from the\nPrecambrian ( 1,800 million years) sediments probably represent the\nearliest records of Protista.\n\n\nThe advent of eukaryotes at this critical juncture probably was\nrelated with increased oxygen levels.\n\n\nIt is also possible that the missing link between prokaryotes and\neukryotes is either missing or yet to be recovered.\n\n\nEvolution is not anticipatory.\n\n\nAmbiguity in evolution can be traced back to the origin of earlier\nforms and they appeared as and when the pressures demanded.\n\n\nIt is also suggested that the origin of eukaryotic cells involved\nendosymbiosis, the engulfing of one organism by another, giving rise to cell\norganelles such as the mitochondrion and chloroplast. \n\n \n\nThe three defining properties of living system, namely, self\nmaintenance, growth and reproduction can occur in the total absence of\nsex.\n\n\nPerhaps, the evolution of sex was a biological strategy to meet\nthe vagaries of environment and an ecological necessity.\n\n\nOr, perhaps at some stage in the distant past certain free-living\nsingle-celled organisms exchanged and / or combined genetic material and\ngained advantage over those that did not.\n\n\nThis new means of incorporating adaptive genetic changes presumably\nhelped in rapidly recombining and forming new individuals.\n\n\nThis genetic energy is a driving force and forms a continuum.\n\n\nFavourable traits developed in different individuals were brought\ntogether in one individual.\n\n\nThus, the sexual reproduction along with meiosis helped not only in\nthe recombination of characters but also in developing diverse characters in\nthe offspring.\n\n\nSubsequent to the evolution of sex as well as the acquisition of\nthe filamentous habit another important inevitable event - - death, which\ncame to control the future course of life itself was ushered in.\n\n\nThe immortal unicell which was capable of several functions,\nincluding reproduction, gave way to mortality.\n\n\nHowever, advanced life forms could not have developed without this\ngift of death.\n\n\nThe birth of death took place at least 1,300 Ma ago. \n\n \n\nMetaphytic organisms most probably evolved from unicellular\nprotists.\n\n\nThe first stage in the evolution, that is, arrangement of the cells\nin linear pattern, is quite common in several filamentous algae.\n\n\nThe next step would have been the formation of plate-like bodies or\nsheets.\n\n\nAlgal sheets are known both in  Vendotaenia  , an alga\nrecorded from <*> + - </*> 1 billion year old sediments of the Vindhyan\nSupergroup and  ulva  , a recent green alga in a marine environment.\n\n\nThe earliest unicellular prokaryotes were generalists and could\nperform all the tasks requisite for survival.\n\n\nAs evolution proceeded, different parts of the organisms took over\nfor performing of different tasks, thus initiating specialisation and\ndivision of labour.\n\n\nThis required first specialised tasks being performed by specialised\norgans within the cell and then by specialised cells / tissues.\n\n\nThis gave rise to specialised organs like, roots for anchorage and\nabsorption of nutrients; leaf for photosynthesis and specialised\nreproductive organs. \n\n \n\nHow and when the living system adopted the practice of division\nof labour delegating the workload to specialised cells or group of cells is\nnot known.\n\n\nHowever, the heterocyst of cyanobacteria takes up the\nresponsibility of reproduction in adverse conditions.\n\n\nThe earliest multicellular blue-green algae gradually developed\nfeatures like branching.\n\n\nThey were still inhabiting the aquatic media where nutrients were\nplenty and easily available to all parts of the organism.\n\n\nThey required no foraging roots in a medium containing all the\nnourishment.\n\n\nPerhaps due to depleting nutritional resources of the early sea the\nliving system must have felt the need to move and occupy land.\n\n\nIt is remarkable that a similarity exists in the concentrations of\nthe sea water and our blood.\n\n\nThe salts from the sea water were taken by animals while moving from\nsea to land.\n\n\nAs if to remind this ecological necessity the aquatic media is still\na pre-requisite for fertilization!  \n\n \n\nThe Lower Palaeozoic flora in the marine realm was dominated by\nthe calcareous and non-calcareous algae.\n\n\nSea weeds also developed the power to photosynthesize at greater\ndepths.\n\n\nThe algal flora of Ordovician seas persisted into Silurian which\nwas the time of rapid development of calcareous green algae.\n\n\n Prototaxites  - - an enigmatic form with ground mass of\nsmall, thin-walled septate, branched, inter woven hyphae and vertical, large\nthick-walled, aseptate tube appeared in Silurian.\n\n\nIt may be related to the brown algae or to a higher plant.\n\n\nBut presence of tissues distributed as radially elongated masses\nthat bear crude resemblance to medullary rays, indicates that such forms\nperhaps represent intermediate stage between true land plants and their\nancestors probably green algae. \n\n \n\nThe early plants of aquatic system mostly spent their lives\nattached to the sea-floor and continuously bathed in water.\n\n\nThe evolutionary transition from sea to land demanded a variety of\nadaptive features.\n\n\nThe first problem was of support.\n\n\nThe atmospheric gases also influenced the gas exchange system.\n\n\nThe ecological consequences such as the non-availability of food\nsupply in air as compared to its availability in water lead to development\nand evolution of food supply system.\n\n\nThese changes brought about structural changes in trophic levels,\nproductivity and resource management.\n\n\nThe glaciation during the Ordovician probably had an impact on sea\nlevel and put more stress on plant life which boldly evolved many vegetative\nadaptations.\n\n\nThe stress tolerant intertidal and sub-tidal algae gradually\nexplored terrestrial environments.\n\n\nThe pressure variations of oxygen in the  atmosphere\ndue to photosynthetic activity of early life forms in aquatic systems\npossibly helped inva<l.sion of land by plants.\n\n\nThe circumstances for the extinction of animals at the terminal\nOrdovician were probably a boon to trigger invasion of primitive green\nland plants.\n\n\nIt is suggested that members of Chlorophyceae and Charophyceae\nwere possible precursors of early land plants as evidenced from molecular\ngenetics. \n\n \n\nThe early land plants have horizontal mode of habitat.\n\n\nAs they had to grow against the gravity, they evolved structural\nsupport system such as cuticle and mechanical tissues to stay upright.\n\n\nThe underground root system developed for gathering water and\nnutrients from soil helped anchor the plant.\n\n\nThe internal transport system and reproductive system were\nstrengthened in response to changing ecological needs.\n\n\nDifferential photosynthetic tissue distribution viz-a-viz light\navailability and water loss controlling adaptability are novel methods\nthrough which plants managed a gradual balancing system.\n\n\nThe evolution   of\nconducting strands ( as seen in non-vascular plants), cuticle for water\nproofing, stomata for gaseous exchange, xylem, ( as seen in vascular\nplants) for better upward flow of water and its strengthening by\nstructural molecule lignin and internal nutrient conducting system through\nthe development of phloem are some of the unique adaptations of plants.\n\n\nCompetition for available light encouraged differential growth\npatterns and effective adaptations to life in air.\n\n\nThis diversification further aided by appearance of herbs, shrubs\nand finally the trees representing distinctive layers where more organisms\ncould be encompassed within a community.\n\n\nOften associated with sheets of cuticle are recorded a number of\nmicrofossils that have been referred to as tube or tracheid-like cells.\n\n\nThey have been found in fossils of  Nematothallus  , and\nsome types are known to occur within the problematic plant  Prototaxites\n .\n\n\nWhile these  \" tubes\"  fail to meet the general\ncriteria of a tracheid, the structural organization does suggest a\nfunctional role of both conduction and support.\n\n\nSince none of the tubes have been found  in situ  it is\nimpossible to state whether they belong to land in,l>habiting embryophytes or\nsome group of aquatic organisms.\n\n\nLike the cuticle, their significance in the fossil record should be\nviewed as an indication of structural adaptation, and not necessarily of\nhabitat or biological affinity. \n\n \n\nThese changes coupled with reproductive adaptations got\nintegrated over a period of time to deal with relatively desiccating\nenvironment.\n\n\nIn the earlier stages of this evolution, the gametophyte and the\nsporophyte were more or less in competition; eventually moisture requirements\ndictated the dominance of sporophyte.\n\n\nThe energy management process channelised appearance of\nmicro-and mega-spores ultimately leading to the evolution of seed\nhabit.\n\n\nWith the passage of time sexual reproduction increased in\nefficiency as a result of which communities slowly became more diversified.\n\n\nVegetative adaptations permitted the initial invasion of land\nwhile reproductive mechanism followed.\n\n\nThe evolution of seed was an important break-through in land\nplant reproductive strategies.\n\n\nThe discovry of a  \" missing link\" </qote> , a new type of\nseed in Lower Carboniferous Montague Noire deposit, France, which has no\npollentrapping structure or evident access for the pollen to the female\ngametophyte is significant.\n\n\nIt suggests in intermediate evolutionary stage between\npteridophytic and gymnospermous reproduction and hence is an important\nstep in evolutionary history.

{"text": "IRRADIATED FOODS     \n\n \n\n Irradiated foods are  safe for human  consumption.\n\n\nBut how  viable they are for \ncommercial  exploitation in a  developing\ncountry like  Indiac ?   \n\n \n\n  ANY   method of food preservation,\nbe it sterilizing, drying, freezing, canning or irradiation, aims at\nkilling or rending sterile insect pests, reducing the level of bacterial\ncontamination or in case of fruits and vegetables to prevent or delay their\nripening, with the sole purpose of giving them a longer shelf-life. \n\n \n\nIrradiation as a method of food preservation has been studied\nmore extensively than any other method over the last three decades.\n\n\nHowever, despite the fact that it is a simple and safe technology, its\nacceptance and commercialization has been slow.\n\n\nOne of the reasons is that a food irradiation facility entails\nconsiderable financial investment which the industry would   be reluctant to make when alternate chemical and physical preservation\ntechniques are already in use.\n\n\nOther reasons are: the technology is still not fully accepted or even\nunderstood by many food technologists; it requires strict regulatory\nprocedures; and the fear the public has of anything to do with  `\nirradiation'  .\n\n\nThe main fears voiced are that irradiation will make the food\nradioactive, induce chemical changes in it, and the irradiation facility\nitself will pose a risk to workers and members of the public in case of an\naccident or even under normal conditions, although most of these fears are\nunfounded.\n\n\nFood irradiation, on the other hand, is a commercially viable and\npollution-free technique of extending the shelf-life of many foods.\n\n\nBut it does not imply that irradiation is the ideal solution.\n\n\nThe biggest drawback in the marketing of irradiated food today is\nthat foodstuffs after and before irradiation look identical and there is no\nsimple or commercially viable test to determine if the food with a higher\nprice tag claiming to be irradiated is actually so. \n\n \n\nAlthough research in the area of food irradiation began in the US\nin the  , it was only after the blanket clearance given by the\njoint FAO / IAEA / WHO ( Food and Agriculture Organization, International\nAtomic Energy Agency, World Health Organization) expert committee in\n1981 recommending that all foodstuffs irradiated up to 10 kGy ( Gy stands\nfor gray, which is a measure of the absorbed energy ) could be used without\nany further toxicological or nutritional testing, that food irradiation\nprogrammes really opened up the world over. \n\n \n\nThe USSR was the first country to go into full-scale\ncommercialization of irradiated food products.\n\n\nOthers soon followed suit; Belgium, France, Netherlands and Canada\nhave been irradiating fish and meat products; Japan, Hungary and Mexico,\npotatoes and onions; Argentina, Brazil, Denmark, France, Finland,\nHungary, Norway, USA and Yugoslavia use irradiation to preserve species.\n\n\nTo date 36 countries have cleared one or more irradiated food\nproducts for consumption and around 150 commercial food irradiating\nfacilities are operating in 19 countries, including those used for\nsterilizing medical products. \n\n\n  How irradiation is done  \n\n \n\nFood irradiation means exposing food to high-energy\nelectromagnetic radiations such as X-rays and gamma rays or accelerated\nelectron beams having energies up to 10 million electron volts ( Mev).\n\n\nBy penetrating into the cells of micro-organisms, the radiations\ncause structural and functional changes in biomolecules leading to cell\ndeath.\n\n\nThe effect is either direct, that is, the molecules absorb radiation\nenergy causing self-destruction, or indirect, that is, the radiation is\nabsorbed by other molecules which react with the cell constituents.\n\n\nInvestigations suggest that the DNA of the cell is the prime target\nof these radiations but the precise mechanism by which DNA damage occurs is\nstill not clear. \n\n \n\nBothe X-ray/gamma ray and electron beam methods have their\nadvantages and disadvantages.\n\n\nElectron beams are safer since they do not involve transport of\nradioactive material.\n\n\nThey can be directed to the target and turned off for repair or\nmaintenance work.\n\n\nHowever, the method is expensive and the electrons have a low\npenetrating    power.\n\n\nSo they can be used for irradiating a thin layer of food, for\nexample, grain on a conveyor belt. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, X-rays and gamma rays have a high-penetrating\npower, but the former are again expensive and not used in food\nirradiation.\n\n\nAlthough many experts feel that the future of food irradiation lies\nwith electron beams, the choice today seems to be gamma rays, which\nrequire strict precautions since they are emitted in all directions from a\nradioactive source.\n\n\nThe radioactive nuclides, cobalt-60 and caesium-137 have been\nselected internationally as gamma ray sources, taking into account their\neconomics, availability and safety.\n\n\nNeither of the nuclides gives rise to any gaseous intermediates as\nthey decay, which is important since the radioactive source is encapsulated\nin a stainless steel rod and welded.   \n\n\n  Where irradiation is required  \n\n \n\nAll foods are not amenable to irradiation processing.\n\n\nFor instance, milk, eggs and high-fat-foods are not to be treated\nwith gamma radiation.\n\n\nBeing a need-based technology, it is used only when economically\nadvantageous. \n\n \n\nIrradiation is used to delay the sprouting of onions and potatoes\nand the ripening of fruits and vegetables, kill or render sterile insect\npests and reduce bacterial contamination.\n\n\nIrradiation followed by storage at 15  o C enables\nlong-term storage of potatoes and is a cheaper alternative to storing\nunder-refrigerated conditions.\n\n\nOnions also have to be stored under wellventilated conditions to\nprevent rotting.\n\n\nWhile the actual dosage used depends on the function to be carried\nout ( see Table. 1 ) , the energy of the gamma radiation is much below the\nlevel which can induce radioactivity, the main fear of the public.\n\n\n( Radiation sources, however, are widely used today in industrial\nradiographic cameras, nuclear medicine and X-ray units and nuclear power\nand research reac. tors.\n\n\nIn fact, 65 per cent of the total radiation an average person is\nexposed to, is due to natural cosmic radiations, 33 per cent to medical\nradiations, 1 to 2 per cent from nuclear explosions and the remaining from\nthe running of nuclear reactors. )\n\n\nIn case of food irradiation there is no direct contact with the\nradioactive source and the food does not get contaminated just as a bag\npassing through an X-ray machine does not become radioactive. \n\n \n\nIrradiation offers an alternative to the use of chemicals which\nleave behind toxic residues.\n\n\nPresent measures taken to prevent losses in stored grains due to\ninsect infestation include fumigation with chemical pesticides.\n\n\nIt has been shown that irradiation of wheat is effective against all\nstages of insect life.\n\n\nIt must be emphasized, however, that irradiation alone will not be\nnot sufficient.\n\n\nIn the absence of proper storage facilities and handling practices,\nreinfestation can occur.\n\n\nEvidence as to whether fungal infestations are affected by\nirradiation are confusing and conflicting.\n\n\nOne study by the National Institute of Nutrition ( NIN ) ,\nHyderabad, shows that irradiation of wheat leads to the production of\naflatoxins, whereas many other studies indicate that at dosages required\nfor insect disinfectations, there is a restricted growth of toxin producing\nfungi. \n\n \n\nIn another study, again by NIN, severely undernourished\nchildren who were fed freshly irradiated wheat developed a condition known\nas polyploidy, in which extra chromosomes are developed in the cells.\n\n\nA subsequent Chinese study did not find this problem and even in\nNIN, children who were fed irradiated wheat which had been stored for 12\nweeks did not show this condition. \n\n\n  Cold process  \n\n \n\nAn advantage of irradiation is that it is a cold process and does\nnot increase the temperature of the food.\n\n\nThis allows the processing of frozen foods such as fish and shrimps.\n\n\nDue to the highly penetrating nature of radiations, the food can\nbe irradiated in pre-packed conditiions, thus avoiding recontamination.\n\n\nIndia today exports sea foods worth  Rs.  4,000\nmillion annually.\n\n\nMany of these consignments get rejected due to contamination with\nsalmonella from frozen sea food.\n\n\nIt has been shown that irradiation at four to five kGy eliminates\nsalmonella in frozen sea food.\n\n\nIt is perhaps to combat these endemic levels of salmonella in sea\nfood and chicken that irradiation can be used.\n\n\nOne can very well argue that salmonella can however can be controlled\nby increased levels of hygiene and irradiation should not be used as a\ncover for  this.\n\n\nBut after realizing the efficiency of irradiation, the US and UK\ngovernments have cleared irradiation of poultry and seafoods recently.\n\n\n \n\nSpices often get contaminated with bacteria, moulds and insects.\n\n\nThey can be treated with fumigants like methyl bromide, ethylene\noxide and propylene oxide.\n\n\nA single irradiation treatment at a dose of up to 10 kGy can also\nbe used to decontaminate them under pre-packed conditions.\n\n\nSpices, especially black pepper, cardamom, ginger and turmeric,\nform a substantial part of  exports to the USA, Europe and\nthe Middle East.\n\n\nThese countries have been processing the spices at the point of\nimport by fumigation and in some cases with the emerging irradiation\ntechnique.\n\n\nWith the banning of ethylene oxide the world over because   it leaves toxic\nresidues, and irradiation at a maximum of 10kGy having been cleared as being\nsafe, the latter method is gaining popularity.\n\n\nThe National Monitoring Agency ( NMA ) constituted by the\nGovernment of India to oversee all aspects of food irradiation has accorded\nclearance for the irradiation of onions, frozen seafoods and spices for\nexport.\n\n\nIt is proposing to build the first commercial irradiator in India for\nthe processing of spices at Cochin.\n\n\nThe facility is expected to take about two years for completion at a\ncost of approximately  Rs.  12 million.\n\n\nThe target market for the irradiated foods is the USA, UK and Europe.\n\n\nAlthough there is a market in Japan they will not accept food\nirradiated in any other country than their own. \n\n \n\nAs yet clearance has not been given for domestic consumption,\nsince the standards such as labelling etc have not been finalized by the\nhealth ministry.\n\n\nInitially clearance will be given for onions, potatoes and spices.\n\n\nIt is expected that the former two will cost about 10-15 \npaise  per kg extra.\n\n\nFor spices it will be more but these are expensive commodities\nanyway. \n\n \n\nFruits such as avocados, bananas, guavas, mangoes and pears\nirradiated in the mature but unripe state show a delay in ripening.\n\n\nThis is attributed to the reduced sensitivity of the fruits to the\naction of the ripening harmones as well as the slowing down of the\nmetabolic pathways.\n\n\nAlthough this would give them an extended shelf-life, how desirable\nthis would be is debatable.\n\n\n( Since fresh-looking fruits and vegetables would not really be\nso. )\n\n\nIrradiation can and is being used as a quarantine treatment\nfor papayas in the US and is known to kill the mango seed weevil, which at\npresent inhibits us from exporting mangoes to the US and Japan. \n\n\n  Capital intensive technology  \n\n \n\nFood irradiation is a capital intensive technology and the\ninstallation and running costs are extremely high.\n\n\nFurthermore, the facility must be utilized round the clock so as to\nmake full use of an expensive, constantly decaying source.\n\n\nThe capital and service costs for food irradiation processing, based\non 1988 data evaluated by technical studies at BARC are shown in Table.2.\n\n\n \n\nCosts abroad have been estimated as high as\n\n$ 2 to 4 million as an on site extension to a food processing plant.\n\n\nThe food processing companies would therefore need to find a bulk\nmarket to justify the high capital costs.\n\n\nWhether or not a developing country like India should go in for such\na capital intensive technology in the absence of proper storage\nfacilities such as insect-proof bags and silos, refrigeration and an\nefficient transport system is arguable.\n\n\nThe actual quantification of savings in food losses is a rather grey\narea, since true figures are often not available and even if known, not\nreadily accepted by concerned agencies.\n\n\nThe temptation to cheat and irradiate a badly contaminated product\nalso exists and strict monitoring and control is necessary. \n\n \n\nSince food is often irradiated in the pre-packed condition to\navoid reinfestation, the packaging material should not be adversely\naffected by radiation leading to the contamination of food.\n\n\nAn approved list of packaging materials suitable for radiation\nprocessing has been arrived at as a result of an extensive research in USA\nand Canada. \n\n \n\nAnother area where research is necessary is in monitoring the\nchemical effects of irradiation and comparing them with other changes that\nmay take place in food.\n\n\nAlthough the radiation doses are well below the levels which produce\nradioactivity, knowledge of radioactivity produced at higher energies is\nstill unsatisfactory.\n\n\nA fear expressed by some sections is that the process may not kill\nall the microorganisms.\n\n\nIt is known that ionizing radiations are mutagenic and lethal for\nmost bacteria.\n\n\nHowever, the proportion of a bacterial population surviving a dose\nof radiation depends on the species, the stage in its life-cycle, the amount\nof radiation damage and the ability of the damaged species to revive.\n\n\nIt is feared that the surviving bacteria or their spores would grow\nand multiply without competition when other organisms have been killed and\ncould produce toxins in food that appears edible due to the absence of\nspoilage organisms.\n\n\nThe fact that some bacteria can mutate to form more resistant strains\nhas been demonstrated under laboratory conditions. \n\n \n\nIrradiation as a method of food preservation may not be the\nperfect solution for our country, but we may have to accept the fact that\njust as we cannot avoid the use of pesticides despite all the proven hazards,\nit may be impossible for us to avoid food irradiation in the near future,\ngiven the fact that when applied appropriately, it does not pose\ntoxicological hazards, is clean and less energy consuming than other\npreservation methods.  <logos>", "subdomain":

{"text": "SCIENCE & TECHONOLOGY    \n\n\n  Earthshaking lack of knowledge   \n\n \n\n For  millennia humans have wondered about what lay\nbeneath their feet - - the mysterious underground.\n\n\nThe inside of the earth is far more complicated than it was realised\never before.\n\n\nThe rise of seismology - - the science of earthquakes - - has led to a\ngreater understanding of the  structure.\n\n\nThe familiar onion-layer picture, with an outer crust, a core at the\ncentre and a mantle in between, describes almost all.\n\n\nThe little that is left, however, is astonishing.\n\n\nPrediction of an earthquake with complete accuracy is still a\nnovelty in the world of respectable science, though it has come a long way\nfrom folklore. \n\n \n\nUntil a few decades ago the mere idea of a scientific basis for\nforecasting drew a laugh.\n\n\nAs the developer of the Richter scale said,  \" Only fools,\ncharlatans, and liars predict earth-quakes.\" \n\n\nThe amateurs observe such things as peculiar animal behaviour shortly\nbefore an earthquake.\n\n\nHorses, cows and pigs reportedly stampede for no apparent reason.\n\n\nChickens and geese fly around dazedly.\n\n\nDogs bark  \nunseeingly, and snakes slither out of their holes in winter and freeze.\n\n\nFolklore related such animal behaviour to the coming of an\nearthquake.\n\n\nBut nobody knows whether it really is true. \n\n \n\nThe evidence that animals sense coming earthquakes is less than\nconclusive.\n\n\nNow, it may be that water level changes earlier than the quakes have\ndriven snakes and rats out of their holes.\n\n\nSince electromagnetic radiation can be sensed by some animals and\neven people and if there are big electromagnetic frequency changes before\nquakes, it will reopen the question of animal behaviour before earthquakes.\n\n\n \n\nEarthquakes stem primarily from heavings and groanings of the  crust.\n\n\nThey are one expression of mechanism called plate-tectonics.\n\n\nGrowing knowledge of plate-tectonics in the 1970s gave some rationale\nto the sudden ruptures on the earth. \n\n \n\nGiant crustal plates bearing the continents are driven by the\nconvection currents in the hot plastic mantle.\n\n\nThese plates grind past one another or spread apart at mid-ocean\nridges to allow hot magma to well up from below.\n\n\nStress builds up as a result of the sliding plates and finds sudden\nrelease along pre-existing fracture lines called faults.\n\n\nThus earthquakes happen where the plates collide. \n\n \n\nGeologists believe that it is the upper 20 kilometres, in the\ncold brittle part of the  crust, where earthquakes occur.\n\n\nBelow that, it is so hot there cannot be the sudden slip that\ncauses quakes.\n\n\nIt is probably more like hot taffy and the movement goes on all the\ntime.\n\n\nThey don't know how the brittle surface faults are connected to what\nis going on down below.\n\n\nIs it pushing or pulling or is there a complex interaction ?\n\n\nBut had there been pictures of quakes over the last few thousand\nyears, the answer would have been available. \n\n \n\nWhen an earthquake is strong enough, say 4.5 on the Richter\nscale, it will generate shockwaves so intense that they can jiggle the\nrecording pens of seismometers at points far distant from the origin.\n\n\nAnd because these waves will have been diverted from a straight path\nthrough reflection and / or refraction, they can serve geophysicists at\nprobes of the  inner structure. \n\n \n\nSome of the enormous energy generated by even minor quakes\ntravels outward from the point of origin in the form of waves, which are\nbasically of two types.\n\n\nOne is the pressure wave.\n\n\nThis is essentially a sound wave, consisting of a series of\ncompressions and relaxations propagated along the line of travel - -\nlongitudinally.\n\n\nThe speed of these waves depends on the density of the material\nthrough which they travel - - the denser, the faster.\n\n\nSound travels faster through water than through air, and even faster\nthrough a solid-metal railroad track.\n\n\nAnd they can be reflected or refracted when they encounter a\ndiscontinuityan interface between materials of different density. \n\n \n\nThe second kind of a wave launched by an earthquake is a shear\nwave.\n\n\nShear waves jiggle from side to side, perpendicular to the\ndirection of travel.\n\n\nThey can propagate through solids only, not liquids or gases.\n\n\nAnd they travel at only two-thirds the speed of the pressure waves,\nso they arrive at a given point later than pressure waves.  \n\n \n\nEarthquake depths are less accessible than the moons of Jupiter.\n\n\nWith action taking place 10 to 12 kilometres down, the strain signals\nare hard to measure because they decay quickly.\n\n\nEven for large events, the surface manifestation is very small.\n\n\nQuakes are the archetypal nonlinear process.\n\n\nThe earth takes hundreds of years storing vast amounts of energy and\ngives it all back in seconds. \n\n \n\nImperfect foresight has profound implications for millions of\npeople who live along  zones of potential seismic activity.\n\n\nAround the world, quakes on an average kill 10,000 to 15, 000 people\na year and destroy 7 billion worth of property.\n\n\nThe number of deaths varies widely.\n\n\nIn 1976, as many as 700,000 may have died, most of them in a single\nquake in China that was not predicted. \n\n \n\nWhile scientists are using their instruments to create a\ncontemporary record, they are also striving to maintain and extend the\nhistorical record.\n\n\nKnowing when earthquakes have occurred over long periods of time\naffords them a pattern from which they can make assumptions of a reasonable\n ` repeat time'  between two earthquakes. \n\n \n\nToday, researchers all over the world are trying to refine their\nstill shaky art of prediction.\n\n\nIn China, an army of 10,000 scientists and a network of 100,000\namateur observers are engaged in earthquake research.\n\n\nEven though experts are still not able to warn people in time,\nresearch has been encouraging. \n\n \n\nGeophysicists use tillimeters and gravimeters to study possible\ntectonic activity.\n\n\nElectronic instruments measure changes in the local magnetic field\nand in the electrical conductivity of the rocks.\n\n\nRadon gas measurements in well water are taken to detect expansion.\n\n\n \n\nOne area of research is the plotting of sequences of seismic\nactivity.\n\n\nTime and activity patterns, the precise pinpointing of quake-prone\nareas, and the factors that precede and follow quake occurrences are all\nparts of prediction effort.\n\n\nSeismic tomography is being increasingly used to recreate the  images, thus uncovering from crust down to the core-features\nthat range from the unexpected to the earthshaking. \n\n \n\nAccording to a US seismologist, Allan Lindh,  \" The\nstarting point is to divide the amount the earth moved in the last quake by\nthe slip rate.\n\n\nThat is very approximate.\n\n\nYou can only expect to get within about ten per cent of the\nrecurrence time.\n\n\nGround movements can be measured by satellites and lasers to find how\nfast the plates are moving, but we only have a vague idea what the critical\npoint for rupture is.\"  \n\n \n\nResearchers are trying to find out how the long-term strain\naccumulation and release cycles work, interact, and when they will next reach\nthe failure point.\n\n\nA new forecasting method is being tested in Northern Turkey under the\nTurkish-German Earthquake Research Programme.\n\n\nThe method is based on recording and studying of microquakes along a\nfault line, which makes it possible to forecast larger earthquakes.\n\n\nIt was observed that a number of microquakes increased noticeably\nbefore a major earthquake.\n\n\nThis method is not applicable universally because the respective\nlocal geological conditions vary a great deal, which makes an enormous\ndifference. \n\n \n\nThe changes in the distances between the fixed points of\nreference, on the  surface also provide important\ninformation.\n\n\nWithin the framework of the Turkish-German Earthquake Research\nProgramme, the exact distances between fixed points up to 10 kilometres\napart, preferably on mountains, are ascertained with the help of laser beams.\n\n\nShifts of less than five millimetres in the ground plates can thus be\nrecorded. \n\n \n\nOn a global scale, satellite geodetics surveying can detect the\nmovements of entire continents.\n\n\nA laser beam is relayed to the satellite  \" Lageos\" \nfrom the corresponding observation station on the  surface.\n\n\nThis satellite, equipped on all sides with laser mirrors, reflects\nthe incoming light, which is then picked up again by the measurement\nstations.\n\n\nThe exact distance to the satellite can be calculated on the basis\nof the transmission time of the light signals.\n\n\nIf this experiment is carried out from various continents the\ndistance between the continents can be determined with a degree of\nprecision of up to 10 centimetres through geometrical calculations. \n\n \n\nChanges in this distance, however, can be recorded with an\naccuracy of up to one centimetre.\n\n\nResearchers have also discovered that Europe and North America are\ndrifting apart at a speed of two centimetres while Asia and America are\nmoving towards each other at a speed of up to 16 centimetres per year. \n\n \n\nThese findings, however, do not allow deductions to be made with\nregard to locally imminent earthquakes.\n\n\nThe existing network of corresponding observation stations is not\nyet extensive enough.\n\n\nHowever, if a tighter network was set up, especially in regions with\na high earthquake risk, many an earthquake could probably be predicted in\nadvance. \n\n \n\nThe concept of the  ` seismic gap'  has also\nproved its worth when forecasting the location of an earthquake.\n\n\nThe seismic gap refers to the area of a high-risk earthquake\nregion, in which there have been hardly any earthquakes for a longer\nperiod.\n\n\nSeismic tension has been reduced in the  surroundings\nthrough previous earthquakes.\n\n\nThere is an increased probability in the seismic gap, however, that\nthe corresponding plates are under tension and that this might be relieved by\na major quake. \n\n \n\nA major problem in forecasting an earthquake is due to anomalies\nof one or the other of these parameters as a result of which published prior\nwarnings did not come true.\n\n\nThis diminishes confidence in the forecasts.\n\n\nIn an actual earthquake situation the warning might be ignored. \n\n \n\nWhat is more, incorrect forecasts can lead to economic losses for\na certain region.\n\n\nFor example, tourists may decide not to travel, real estate prices\nmay fall or important investments not made.\n\n\nTo ensure that earthquake forecasting is not carried out on a purely\nphenomenological basis, a theory is required that is able to describe what\noccurs in the  mantle prior to an earthquake. \n\n \n\nFor predicting an earthquake one has to know how fast the plates\nare moving and how much plate divergence leads to a quake.\n\n\nBut even with adequate earthquake history and good measurements,\nthe result it still approximate. \n\n \n\nInvestigators know that earthquakes are bound to happen where\nthe plates collide.\n\n\nWhat they don't know and are determined to find out is where a great\nquake will happen first, and whenwith an exactitude fitting in with their\ngeneralised, long-term forecasts.\n\n\nIn short, what they will be able to formulate is early prediction\nas reliable and routine as weather forecasting.  <*> filled square </*>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "34a4a606-733f-4cd3-ac48-f983f5290fb3", "added":

{"text": "<O> \n\n\nP.R. Bhat \n\n\n  PRAGMATIC PRINCIPLES AND LANGUAGE  \n\n \n\nAll credit for showing the place of mind in the process of\nacquiring knowledge goes to Kant.\n\n\nAfter Kant, it is Wittgenstein who takes a revolutionary position in\nhis approach to the theory of knowledge.\n\n\nIt is he who deserves recognition for showing the place of language in\nacquiring and judging knowledge.\n\n\nIt may be said that Wittgenstein has replaced  concept\nof mind by language.\n\n\nThe place of language in  approach to\nphilosophy is as fundamental as the notion of mind in Kantian philosophy.\n\n\nMoore is the first philosopher to give credibility to our intuitions\nstemming from common sense and ordinary language.\n\n\nThough, Moore could make his impact on the method of philosophy, it\nis Wittgenstein who is remembered most for showing the place of language in\ndoing philosophy.\n\n\nAustin, Ryle, Strawson, Hare, Searle, Putnam, Donnellan, Kripke etc.,\nto mention only a few from a very long list, are known for their\ncontributions to philosophy following the method of analyzing ordinary\nlanguage. \n\n \n\nThere is no doubt that the ordinary language analysis coupled\nwith  linguistic intuitions about terms and their uses is well\naccepted as a valid method of doing philosophy today.\n\n\nRyle, for example, by adopting this method ordinary language\nanalysis, came to certain important conclusions about the human mind.  1\n\n\n\nSpeech act analysis has credibility mainly because the insights about\nthe working of ordinary language are used in developing this method.  2\n\n\n\nWhat is normally included under the title of   meta-ethics  is basically the analysis of value in ordinary\nlanguage.\n\n\nHare, for example, extensively uses this method in developing theory\nabout moral language.  3  \n\n \n\nIndividual philosophers, without making special efforts to\norganize the insights about the working of language have used the ordinary\nlanguage analysis as a means to arrive at their own philosophical conclusions\npaying hardly any attention to their powerful method of doing philosophy.\n\n\n ` Pragmatics'  is the name given to the study of\nlanguage from the perspective of  ` language as a means'  as a\npart of semiology.\n\n\nIt is a growing field drawing literature from the field of\nphilosophy and linguistics. \n\n \n\nThe studies of linguists of the pragmatic aspect of language,\noften have been in the direction of understanding the mechanism of language.\n\n\nAnd some of them, perhaps, saw it as an alternative to Chomskian\nmodel of understanding language.\n\n\nPhilosophers have found pragmatics to be quite close to what they\nhave called  ` ordinary language analysis'  .\n\n\nThey have often used isolated insights about the working of language\nin solving philosophical riddles without paying much attention to many of the\nunderlying pragmatic principles of the language that they are using.\n\n\nAs they have primarily concerned themselves with the theories of\nmeaning, rules, and other related issues, they were forced to study\npragmatics of language incidentally without which they would not have found\nit possible to explain, for example, what is  ` meaning'  .\n\n\nA fuller understanding of pragmatic aspects of the working of\nlanguage is yet to be achieved despite numerous attempts by philosophers and\nlinguists.\n\n\nThis paper aims to put a step towards that by highlighting certain\npragmetic principles, some of which may go otherwise unnoticed. \n\n \n\nThe speakers of any natural language have to adhere to, among\nother things, the pragmatic norms of the use of language,  is quite obvious.\n\n\nIn any dynamic society, the activity of introducing new words,\nmodifying the uses of the existing ones in order to express thoughts more\nrigourously or more precisely or in an unambiguous manner, introducing some\nchange in the uses of the words, or creative deviation from the normal uses\nof words, etc., are inevitable.\n\n\nAnd all these activities are subsumed under the single heading\n ` pragmatics'  in this essay. \n\n \n\nSome of the pragmatic principles that we use to organise our\nlanguage are not so obvious because we have internalised them.\n\n\nSome of these principles that we shall discuss in this paper are as\nfollows : [ 1] the  Principle of Regularity in use  [ 2] the\nPrinciple of the  Economy of vocabulary,  [ 3] the \nElasticity or Rules,  [ 4]  Creative Users of Words,  and [ 5]\nthe Concept of  Enabling Institution  .\n\n\nIt is not the case that only one pragmatic principle would be at work\nat a given time; they may all work together to facilitate the use of\nlanguage. \n\n\n 1.  Regularity in Use  \n\n \n\nEvery user of language knows this principle, though one might not\nbe conscious of this.\n\n\nFrequent deviations from the normal use of words cannot be\nappreciated.\n\n\nConsider for the sake of argument the following example : a person\nuses a natural language always with one deviation from the normal use of one\nof the words that constitute his sentence.\n\n\nThis deviation is such that he does not repeat is pattern of\ndeviation every time he uses the same word in the same sentence; but would do\nit differently whenever he uses the same sentence again.\n\n\nOr he utters the same sentence second time, but this time he deviates\nin the use of some other word.\n\n\nThough the use of all the words except one, each time he utters a\nsentence, is in accordance with the accepted rules of the language, one would\nnecessarily fail to understand his speech.\n\n\nThis is because one cannot mark the \ndeviation from the normal uses of words, as he deviates every time he utters\na sentence.\n\n\nWe do not make any beginning in understanding any of the sentences he\nutters.\n\n\nNot even one sentence one could be sure of understanding when he\nspoke.\n\n\nSuch deviations cannot be noted and taken into consideration while\ninterpreting his sentnece.\n\n\nOnly in conjunction with the sentences that have been understood, the\nsentences that have not been understood can be put to certain\ninterpretations.\n\n\nAnd marking a deviation from the normal use of a word requires\ncertain new interpretation of rules for the use of the deviated word.\n\n\nAnd this could be done only on the basis of the sentences that have\nbeen understood.\n\n\nOn the other hand, one can perfectly understand what a person intends\nto communicate even if he deviates from the normal uses of words provided\nthat his deviation of the term is consistent and regular.\n\n\nEvery time he uses the word, he should be using the word in the same\nmanner in which he has used it earlier.\n\n\nThis is how inquisitive parents understand their \nlanguage even though a  language does not conform to the\nrules of an adult language.\n\n\nSome children associate certain sounds with certain concepts in\ntheir own peculiar manners.\n\n\nThis association is discovered by curious parents and communication\nis made possible.\n\n\nDeviation from the normal use of words is not an insurmountable\nproblem; philosophical literature is full of such cases.\n\n\nThe most notorious words which are known for their irregular\nbehaviours in philosophy are  ` knowledge', ` truth'  and\n ` real'  .\n\n\nEvery landmark in philosophy is marked by the use of these words in\ncertain deviant manners in the history of philosophy. \n\n \n\nFormal languages take the regularity and consistency in uses of\nsymbols or words for granted.\n\n\nIt is not possible to define what is contradiction, for instance,\nwithout assuming that the uses of words are regular and consistent.\n\n\nThe principle of   regularity in use, is\na bare minimum of rational and purposive use of language. \n\n \n\nOne cannot hope to get any concessions from observing the strict\nrule of regularity and consistency in the use of words.\n\n\nIn order to evoke a certain type of response in a person, even the\npoets who are known for their breaking of the conventional rules of language,\nhave to make a careful choice of words depending on the contexts.\n\n\nA  effort in hunting for the right word to invoke a\ncertain type of emotion in the reader shows that regularity in the use of\nwords is prior to  deviation in the use of those words.\n\n\nPoets make use of the fact that language is used in a systematic\nand regular manner in formulating their sentences.\n\n\nWithout there being regularity and consistency in the use of words by\nthe people, poets would not have succeeded in invoking certain images in\ntheir poetry using the method of deviation from the normal uses of words.\n\n\n\n 2.  Economy of Vocabulary  \n\n \n\nIf the principles of regularity and consistency in the use of\nwords apply to every word of a language, the principle of economy of\nvocabulary applied only to a selective group of words or expressions.\n\n\nThere are mainly two ways in which one practises the principle of\neconomy of vocabulary: [ a]  Economy of Words,  [ b] \nFormulations of Compound Words  .\n\n\nThe philosophical position of Quine, namely, that there are no words\nwhich are redundant in language is the other side of the principle of economy\nof vocabulary.\n\n\nThere are no two words with identical meanings in a language because\nlanguage is an efficiently evolved system - this is another way of stating\nthe same principle of economy of vocabulary.\n\n\nThe main aim of the principle of economy of vocabulary is to avoid\nduplication of words and their functions.  \n\n\n [ a]  Economy of Words  \n\n \n\nEven if one values clarity, one does not simply undertake a\nproject to introduce new words for each sense of the various terms which are\nambiguous.\n\n\nIntroducing a new word is the last option that one exercises when\neverything else has failed.\n\n\nImagine the number of words and the efforts on the part of the users\nof language that is needed if one were to replace the word  ` Mary'\n by unique words in order to represent each individual called by this\nname all over the world.\n\n\nIf there is any confusion due to the multiplicity of reference of the\nname  ` Mary'  , we simply provide an identyfying description\nof the person along with the name in question in the context for the\nidentification. \n\n \n\nOne copes with the situation by simply distinguishing two or more\nsenses of term for a limited purpose, instead of introducing a new word\nfor every sense of a term burdening the rest of the speakers of the language\nhaving to remember those words.\n\n\nMoreover, in the case of clear homonyms, one can use the terms\nwithout ever stating different senses of them.\n\n\nFor instance one is not put to any difficulty even if one does not\nstate explicitly the different senses of the term  ` cricket'\n while using this word.\n\n\nA situation where one is likely to use this term as the name of an\ninsect would be quite different from the one where this term is used to refer\nto a game.\n\n\nThis type of ambiguity does not create any serious practical problem\nfor the users of language.\n\n\nSimilarly, it serves no purpose to replace the term  ` wicket'\n by three distinct words to distinguish the three senses of the term,\nnamely, the batsman, the pitch and the stumps.\n\n\nThe term  ` wicket'  in the sentence  `\nEngland has only two wickets in hand now'  can never be confused with\nthe pitch or stumps. \n\n \n\nHomonyms are wrongly thought to be linguistic accidents by some\nphilosophers.  4 \n\n\nThere seems to be an optimum use of the \nprinciple of economy of vocabulary underlying such linguistic accident.\n\n\nFor instance, one could clarify the two or more notions that are\nassociated with a term, or preferably coin new terms to use them as separate\nwords.\n\n\nFor instance, the term  ` kite'  as the name of a bird\ncould be easily distinguished from the plaything, and one could use two\nseparate words if one wants.\n\n\n ` Kite'  as the name of a natural kind which cannot\nbe confused with  ` kite'  which is a plaything.\n\n\nOne does not take the trouble to assign new and distinctive words to\ndifferent homonyms distinguishing their different senses, because one does\nnot encounter any practical difficulty because of homonyms. \n\n \n\nEven a homonym which denotes two or more complex notions could be\nused without stating its different senses explicitly.\n\n\nFor instance, the term  ` house'  when used in\ndifferent contexts denotes different complex notions.\n\n\nWhen used to refer to the place where humans inhabit, it means one\nthing; and when used to refer to industrial complexes it means quite another.\n\n\nBesides when the term is used to refer to a body of elected\nrepresentatives, as in the case of house of commons' it denotes yet\nanother thing.\n\n\nBut one does not find the necessity to coin separate words for these\ndifferent senses of the term in question for all practical purposes. \n\n\n [ b]  Formulations of Compound Words  \n\n \n\nIf having two or more senses attached to one word is one way of\neconomizing on the vocabulary, then forming compound words by using the words\nin currency is another.\n\n\nIn general, when the situation becomes very complex due to the\nexpansion of knowledge or for other compelling reason, one normally\ncompounds the existing words or introduces new expressions to meet the\nsituation effectively.\n\n\nThe uses of the term  ` bank'  , for instance in a\nvariety of contexts, posed the difficulty of obscurity of  meanings; and compound words were conveniently introduced like,\n ` blood bank', ` question bank'  etc., demarcating the\ndifferent uses of the term  ` bank'  to meet the situation\neffectively.\n\n\nThis is what must have been the reason why the use of term  `\nwar'  is extended beyond recognition.\n\n\nWe have invented the ways of coping with situation of referring to\ndifferent forms of wars using certain combination of the words which are in\ncurrency.\n\n\nWe have now,  ` world war', ` economic war', ` star war', `\ncivil war', ` cold war'  etc.\n\n\nWe can even anticipate the possible situations where the need would\nbe felt to coin the compound words :  ` communal war', ` sports war',\n` cultural war'  etc.\n\n\nNo doubt that man is an economic user of words in language. \n\n \n\nIt is possible to compound words without burdening the\nspeakers of language, and such a method is preferred for the obvious\nreason that it would help the speakers to keep their vocabulary within the\nmanageable number.\n\n\nSurely, economy of vocabulary favourably affects the economical use\nof human memory.\n\n\nThere are yet other less consciously used methods used by the\nmembers of a society which seem to be based on economic use of memory.\n\n\nThis is no other method than adding new ceiteria for the uses of\nwords while modifying or completely discontinuing the existing ones. \n\n \n\nCertain criteria would be shared between the parent term and the\nnewly formed compound word when we follow such a method.\n\n\nTo consider the example of  ` war'  again, it is with\nthe war spirit that we approve of economic sanctions against a country.\n\n\nNonetheless, one does not fight economic war with guns and bullets.\n\n\nThe specific criterion for identifying an economic war is\ndifferent from that of a military attack.\n\n\nNon-cooperation may be the main thing that is shared between\n ` economic war'  and  ` cold war'  on the one\nside, and  ` war'  on the other.\n\n\n ` Civil wars'  have non-cooperation as a common  criterion with  ` economic war'  .\n\n\n ` Star wars'  have certain other criteria common to\nmilitary attacks.\n\n\nAll wars share some resemblances; they belong to a family.  6", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5fe2f0dd-4133-418d-bf49-b98ab647191a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.104983+00:00"}
{"text": "FICKLE GENOME AND CANCER    \n\n \n\n All  forms of life on earth are exposed to agents\nthat cause damage to the genetic material contained within the cells.\n\n\nThese agents are called  'mutagens'  .\n\n\nHowever, the aberrations of the genome may also arise from mutagens\nproduced within the cell itself.\n\n\nFortunately the genetic material is a very stable structure and\nvarious mechanisms are present within the cell to maintain the stability of\nthe genome.\n\n\nBut in spite of the existence of such mechanisms, damages do occur in\nthe genome sometimes with harmful consequences such as cancers. \n\n \n\nSometimes there are gross damages and the repair mechanism cannot\ncope.\n\n\nOr else the repair mechanism is not good enough.\n\n\nIn both cases genomic stability is disrupted.\n\n\nGenome instability is the root cause of many pathological conditions\nincluding cancer.\n\n\nA study of genomic instabilities in cancer provides clues to\nunderstanding the molecular basis of the dreaded disorder.\n\n\nIn DNA replication, the enzyme DNA polymerase plays a vital role.\n\n\nIt strings together the free nucleotides into a chain, by matching\neach with its complementary nucleotide on the parent strand.\n\n\nThis enzyme functions at a number of essential sites.\n\n\nIf the match between DNA nucleotides is    successful; that is if the pairing is A-T (\nAdenine-thymine ) or C-G ( Cytosine-Guanine ) ; then the incoming nucleotide\nis added to the chain through a bridging phosphate group, but if a mismatched\nnucleotide occurs the polymerase enzyme can remove the mismatched nucleotide\nand replace it with a correct nucleotide.\n\n\nThis mechanism is known as  'proof-reading'  . \n\n \n\nIn spite of such proof-reading activity, errors do occur (\nfrequency of such errors is about one in every 10 billion base pairs copied )\nduring the DNA replication.\n\n\nRare errors such as these during proof-reading activity change\ngenetic fine structure.\n\n\nThis in turn changes the gene product as well and in most cases lead\nto the production of non-functional proteins.\n\n\nBut, sometimes, a variant or mutant functional protein may also be\nformed due to the errors in DNA metabolism.\n\n\nMany of such proteins have the ability to turn a cell cancerous.\n\n\nOne such protein is the   ` mutant ras'   .\n\n\nIt is     the most frequently observed cancer-causing\nprotein in human malignant disease, being present in 30 % of all cancers.\n\n\nThe function of   'ras'   in normal cells is\nnot clear although it is thought to have a role in the control of cell growth\nand in the maintenance of cell differentiation. \n\n \n\nMutations may also arise spontaneously within the cell.\n\n\nIt has been found that most cancers arise from spontaneous errors in\nnormal cellular processes.\n\n\nThese errors cause structural and functional instability of DNA.\n\n\nSpontaneous mutations in cancer generally arise from failure in the\nDNA polymerase proof-reading activity and oxygen damage.\n\n\nOxygen damage results when DNA reacts with free radicals ( very\nhighly reactive free atoms or ions) generated during normal oxidative\nmetabolism.\n\n\nIn cells subjected to ionizing radiation such as x-rays the water\nmolecules break to produce hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals.\n\n\nIn presence of oxygen, the hydrogen radical produces hydrogen\nperoxide radical.\n\n\nIt is the highly reactive hydrogen peroxide molecule that induces\nmutation.\n\n\nThis    in   turn could lead to cancerous\nchanges in the cell. \n\n \n\nAnother cellular error that could lead to cancer is gene\namplification.\n\n\nGene amplification or the production of multiple copies of a gene\nleads to over-production of a specific protein.\n\n\nThis at times results in cancer.\n\n\nIn some developmental programmes, gene amplification is a normal\nevent.\n\n\nThe amplification of chorion genes in the ovaries of fruitfly is one\nsuch example.\n\n\nBut, in mammals,    amplification is an unscheduled berration and\noccurs mostly during the formation of a tumour.\n\n\nTwenty to thirty per cent of certain solid tumours carry amplified\ncellular oncogenes - - a group of 30-50 genes present in normal cells and\nwhich resemble the cancer causing genes found in cancer viruses.\n\n\nThese genes normally remain quiescent but can get transformed and\ntrigger cancerous growth.\n\n\nAmplification does not affect cellular oncogenes at random.\n\n\nIt seems that some genes are preferentially amplified but the reason\nfor such preferential amplification of genes is not clear. \n\n \n\nThe exact cause and mechanism of amplification is also yet to be\nestablished.\n\n\nSeveral rival theories seek to explain the mechanism.\n\n\nIt is now established clearly that, amplification occurs rarely in\nnormal cells, but appears to become more common as cells progress towards\nmalignancy.\n\n\nThe rate of amplification can be increased several fold by various\ndrugs, carcinogens ( cancer causing chemicals), and ultraviolet radiation.\n\n\nThese observations have led to the hypothesis that, a variety of\nagents may induce  \" misfiring\"  of replication, resulting in\nthe generation of amplified DNA.\n\n\nWhen a stretch of DNA with an oncogene on it spontaneously amplifies,\ncertain cellular security checks are breached.\n\n\nThis amplification allows the host cell to escape growth control.\n\n\nIt becomes mobile and invasive and may escape immune surveillance.\n\n\nMost frighteningly, these features may pass on to the daughter cells,\nestablishing malignant cancers. \n\n \n\nSince amplification of cellular oncogenes is often a recurrent\ngenetic abnormality in cancer cells, it looks as if amplification is the\ncause and malingnant growth the consequence.\n\n\nDifferent levels of gene amplification have been associated with\ndifferent types of cancers depending on which gene has been amplified and to\nwhat extent. \n\n \n\nThe genetic material is the most conserved cellular molecule.\n\n\nAt the same time, it is the most susceptible to environmental damage.\n\n\nFor example, when struck by ionizing radiation, the backbone of a DNA\nmolecule is often broken and when exposed to avariety of chemicals produced\neither inside or outside the cell, the bases of the DNA molecule are altered\nstructurally or even split away from the backbone.\n\n\nWhen exposed the ultraviolet ( UV ) adjacent pyrimidines on a DNA\nstrand interact with one another to form a covalent complex known as a dimer.\n\n\n \n\nIt is estimated that several thousand bases are lost from a cell\neveryday because of these damages.\n\n\nIf such large damages occur each day, it is reasonable to assume that\na cell would be damaged.\n\n\nHowever, in order to maintain stability of the DNA molecule, various\nin-built cellular mechanisms repair such damages.\n\n\nThere are a variety of enzymes which appear to patrol the DNA,\nsearching for aberrations, alterations and distortions that they can\nrecognize and repair.\n\n\nMost of the repair systems selectively remove or excise away the\ndamaged section of the DNA.\n\n\nThe best studied excision repair system is one which is responsible\nfor removing pyrimidine dimers.\n\n\nIn this process an  enzyme makes an incision\nin the backbone of the altered strand.\n\n\nSuch enzymes are called endonucleases because they cut within the DNA\nstrand.\n\n\nThis nick in the backbone is then recognized by an exonuclease enzyme\n( enzymes which cut nucleotide from the ends ) that proceeds to remove the\nsection of the strand containing the dimer.\n\n\nThe gap is then occupied by a polymerase enzyme that incorporates\ncomplementary nucleotides in the gap and a DNA ligase enzyme seals the break.\n\n\nAnd hey presto !\n\n\nThe error has been corrected. \n\n \n\nInsufficient or faulty ( error-prone )   repair of DNA may cause some types of\ncancers.\n\n\nA classic example is the skin cancer, xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) .\n\n\nIn normal individuals only prolonged and excessive exposure to\nsunlight leads to skin cancer.\n\n\nPatients with xeroderma pigmentosum are unusually sensitive to\nsunlight and run a high risk of developing skin cancers.\n\n\nIn this disease, the pyrimidine dimer removal system is highly\ndeficient.\n\n\nSome reports suggest that skin cancers in XP patients have a higher\nincidence of RAS gene mutations also. \n\n \n\nThere are also other conditions that make one prone to cancer.\n\n\nThese are also thought to involve defects in NA repair mechanism.\n\n\nFor example, ataxia telangiectasia ( AT ) , is thought of as a\nchromosome breakage syndrome.\n\n\nAT cells are sensitive to agents such as X-rays which cause gross\nchromosome breakage.\n\n\nDue to inefficient repair of this type of damage, AT patients become\nsusceptible to cancers of the lymphatic tissues and leukaemias.\n\n\nBut the relationship between such susceptibility, DNA damage and\nfaulty mDNA repair is still unclear. \n\n \n\nApart from malfunctioning enzymes, other factors too contribute\nto genomic instability.\n\n\nThese factors are recombination and chromosomal translocation.\n\n\nTranslocation is the transfer of a section of a chromosome of one\npair to a chromosome of a different pair.\n\n\nChromosomal recombination contributes a lot to the disruption of\ngenomic stability.\n\n\nIt is now clear that sites of consistent chromosomal rearrangement\npinpoint genes that are involved in transforming normal cells to cancerous\nones.\n\n\nOur understanding of the molecular basis of chromosomal\nrearrangements in cancer has been greatly facilitated by advances in gene\nmapping. \n\n \n\nLeukaemias and lymphomas usually have chromosomal rearrangements\nthat can easily be detected by special microscopy techniques.\n\n\nTranslocation seems to be the most common structural aberration\nchromosomes.\n\n\nSuch type of chromosomal rearrangement was first observed in a human\ntumour as early as in 1960.\n\n\nAn unusually small chromosome was found in the leukaemia cells of\npatients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia ( CGL ) .\n\n\nIt was named Philadelphia chromosome.\n\n\nLater it was found that Philadelphia chromosome is derived from a\nreciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22.\n\n\nThe oncogene C-able on chromosome 9 becomes transferred to the\nPhiladelphia chromosome as a result of the translocation.\n\n\nC-sis gene is transferred from chromosome 22 to chromosome 9 as a\nresult of translocation. \n\n \n\nTumour metastasis is a complex process in which cells migrate\nfrom a primary tumor and colonize other organs.\n\n\nTumor metastasis is difficult to treat and is the major cause of\ndeath due to cancer.\n\n\nThe most potent question in this regard is whether metastasis is a\ngenetically controlled phenomenon.\n\n\nTo date 10 oncogenes have been identified which can induce\nmetastasis when introduced into a tumour cell line.\n\n\nBut oncogenes thatinduce metastasis in one cell line do not\nnecessarily do so in another.\n\n\nThe most recent genetical aspect of tumor metastasis is the\nidentification of the metastasis suppressor gene.\n\n\nThis gene, known as nm 23 ( nm stands for non-metastatic) is\nnormally involved in non-metastatic activity of the cell but any mutation in\nthis gene causes loss of function and induces cells to undergo metastasis.\n\n\n \n\nAs more and more evidence of genetic damages asociated with\ncancer cells come to light and their association with biochemical functions\nbecome known, cancer may become more manageable.\n\n\nHope that the day is not too far away when this disorder will join\nthe ranks of those for which successful cure exists.  <*> line above the\neditorial comment </*>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "Turmoil in the valley  \n\n \n\nIT is now disturbingly clear that the weak-kneed-ness of the\nNational Front Government has become an irresistible temptation to Pakistan,\nwhose leaders, irrespective of their party affiliations, are vying with one\nanother in fuelling the turmoil of vile communal passions in the Kashmir\nvalley.\n\n\nThere has been an exodus of the families of the minority community\nfrom the communally virulent valley, which seems to have been taken over by\nthe Pakistan-trained subversives.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to one estimate, about 19,000 families have so far migrated\nfrom the valley to Jammu and other parts of the country.\n\n\nOne can guage the fear psychosis in the valley from the remarks made\nby some of the migrants.\n\n\nOne of them has reportedly said:  \" We do not intend to return\nto the deafening and spine-chilling calls through loudspeakers from atop\nmosques.\" \n\n\nAnd Union Home Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, while conceding in the\n Lok Sabha  the other day that there had been an exodus of\npeople from the valley, sought to reassure members that the situation in the\nborder State did not have communal overtones.\n\n\nOn the same day, Prime Minister V.P.\n\n\nSingh said in the  Rajya Sabha  that  recent pronouncements and actions bearing on Kashmir were unfriendly\nacts.\n\n\nOne wishes he had gone a step further and warned Pakistan of dire\nconsequences if it persisted in interfering in  internal\naffairs.\n\n\nThe best way to know that Pakistan is really up to is to follow a\npolicy of hot pursuit of the saboteurs aided and abetted by Pakistan.\n\n\nThat the feeble warnings administered by the Indian Government so far\nhave had no effect on Islamabad is evident from Pakistan Prime Minister\nBenazir  announcement of Rs.  10-crore \n \" humanitarian aid\"  to the seditionaries in the Indian\nState.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOn the heels of it comes the setting up of a fund, by  Punjab Province Chief Minister Nawaz Sharif, with an initial\nsume of  Rs.\n\n\n five  crores  , to help the militants in\nKashmir.\n\n\nWhat else is it but naked intervention in  internal\naffairs?\n\n\nIf the Kashmir valley is now denuded of the minority community, it is\nthe direct result of the venomous communalism being spread by Pakistani\nagents.\n\n\nThose who are rending asunder the traditional communal harmony in the\nvalley must know that the consequences of what they are doing will not remain\nconfined to Kahsmir.\n\n\nIt is bound to trigger communal passions in other parts of the\nsub-continent.\n\n\nNot even the late President Zia-Ul-Haq, who had become notorious for\nhis wily politics, resorted to intervention in Kashmir so blantantly as at\npresent.\n\n\nThis has given rise to the suspicion in the Indian mind that\nsomething in the Indian political scenario is tempting the Pakistani leaders\nto make another attempt to annex the Indian State.\n\n\nIf Pakistan made such an attempt, it would be the beginning of many\nmore problems, particularly for Pakistan, whose vulnerability to schismatic\nregionalism is well-known.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nRunning parallel to Pakistani provocation are the daily murders\nbeing committed by the mulitants.\n\n\nAnd it is for the benefit of those muderers that Pakistan has set up\ntwo funds!\n\n\nIn the numerous intrigues that Pakistan has launched, there is\nsomething more than meets the eye.\n\n\nNow is the time for the Indian leaders to call a spade a spade and\ntell Pakistan that another war over Kashmir would lead to a situation that\nmight pose a threat to its own existence.\n\n\nLet it not happen.\n\n\nIt is time Pakistani leaders realised that the rise of\nfundamentalist forces in India is a consequence of their reckless communal\npolicy.\n\n\nAnd the Indian leaders would be well-advised to ensure the safe\nreturn of those who have been hounded out of the valley.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  Whither Pakistan?\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPAKISTAN is back to square one.\n\n\nPresident Ghulam Ishaq Khan, a stalking-horse of the Army, has\nuprooted the nascent Pakistani democracy with a vengeance.\n\n\nThe civilian facade that has been erected in place of the dismissed\nBenazir Bhutto Government is intended to silence criticism abroad.\n\n\nAccording to unconfirmed reports received yesterday, Mrs.\n\n\nBhutto was placed under house arrest.\n\n\nThe Presidential action in dismissing the elected Government and\ndissolving the National Assembly is a repetition of what the late President\nZia-ul-Haq did in May 1988.\n\n\nGen.\n\n\n contention was that law and order under the Junejo\nadministration had broken down.\n\n\nIn a futile bid to justify the cold-blooded murder of democracy on\nMonday, Mr.\n\n\nIshaq Khan said that the superior judiciary had been publicly\nridiculed and that the authority, resources and agencies of the Government\nhad been misused for political and personal ends.\n\n\nHow long had this been going on?\n\n\nOne would like to know whether the President had administered a\nwarning to the Government before he took the extreme step of winding up the\nGovernment and the National Assembly lock, stock and barrel.\n\n\nIt is well known that the Pakistani Army, which is known to abound\nwith Zia loyalists, did not take kindly to the restoration of democracy.\n\n\nAt the time of the formation of the Benazir Government, the Army,\nwith the help of Washington, wrested many powers from the Prime Minister.\n\n\nThe Army must have loomed large in Mrs.\n\n\n mind.\n\n\nIt would be naive to think that the Army has not been involved in\npolicies, as Army chief, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg has said.\n\n\nEven while keeping up the appearance of non-involvement in politics,\nthe Army resorted to peaceful penetration of the Government.\n\n\nIt is the Army that has created a situation wherein Mrs. Bhutto had\nto compete with other political leaders in reviving the Kashmir issue.\n\n\nThis is an old Pakistani game. \n\n \n\nLike her predecessors, Mrs. Bhutto too had to play that dangerous\ngame.\n\n\nThe partisan resolution passed by the Organisation of Islamic\nConference in Cairo last week on Jammu and Kashmir was entirely the result of\nMrs.  efforts.\n\n\nWhere exactly has Mrs. Bhutto failed to come up to the democratic\nexpectations of her people?\n\n\nAdmittedly, while yielding to domestic political compulsions, she did\nmany things which had an adverse effect on the already slow-paced\nnormalisation of relations between India and Pakistan.\n\n\nDid the President and his powerful backers in the Army expect Mrs.\nBhutto to work miracles?\n\n\nWith the slender majority that her Government enjoyed in the National\nAssembly, she was doing her best to tackle the national problems.\n\n\nShe seems to have incurred the wrath of the Army by refusing to go\nalong with it on the question of tackling the strife in Sind.\n\n\nAdded to this was her opposition to the Shariat bill moved by the\nfundamentalists.\n\n\nThis led to the revival of the old alliance between the Army and the\nfundamentalists. \n\n \n\nFor some time now, Mr. Ishaq Khan has been toeing the hard-line\non the Kashmir issue, which he considers to be the unfinished agenda of\npartition.\n\n\nThis reflects more the  stand than the  .\n\n\nWith the dismissal of the elected Government, which was responsive to\npublic opinion, India can expect a hardening of the Pakistani approach to the\nKashmir problem.\n\n\nThe constitutional head of Pakistan has acted in the most\nunconstitutional and undemocratic manner.\n\n\nIt is a serious setback to the restoration of democracy in Pakistan.\n\n\nAnd India cannot remain unconcerned at the ascendancy of the Army\nwith a civilian mask in Pakistan.\n\n\nThere is a danger of the Pakistani Army embarking on an armed\nadventure against India.  \n\n\n\n\n   belligerence  \n\n \n\nBY declaring that  annexation of Kuwait is \n\" irreversible and for ever\"  , the megalomaniacal dictator, Mr.\nSaddam Hussein, has made war in the gulf a dead certainty.\n\n\nHe has threatened to strike at West Asia oilfields and Israel if Iraq\nis strangled by the U.S.-led campaign to drive his troops out of Kuwait.\n\n\nThe  statement, broadcast over Baghdad Radio, is\nobviously intended to bid defiance to the U.N., whose General Assembly opened\nits annual session last week with a call for the restoration of the\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Kuwait.\n\n\nIf he thinks he can take on the world, he is sadly mistaken.\n\n\nAlmost the entire world sympathises with Kuwait because it has been\ngobbled up by its big nighbour.\n\n\nInvolved in the gulf issue is the principle of the inadmissibility of\nterritorial annexation.\n\n\nThis is why all the civilised nations, whatever their military\nstrength, have joined in the chorus of protest.\n\n\nBut the tragedy is that Mr. Saddam Hussein does not know how sadly\nisolated he is from the international community.\n\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly fully reflected the global concern at\nthe explosive situation created by the Iraqi President.\n\n\nThe united and firm manner in which the U.N. is dealing with the Gulf\ncrisis will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the world.\n\n\nIf Iraq is allowed to get away with what it has done to Kuwait, it\nwill be a dangerous precedent for the future. \n\n \n\nPeople the world over still remember the Baghdad Revolutionary\nCommand  statement, soon after the invasion on August 2,\nthat Iraq would withdraw its forces within days or weeks, depending on how\nfast the situation stabilised.\n\n\nNow all that has changed.\n\n\nIraq has quietly made Kuwait one of its provinces.\n\n\nWhile the military encirclement of Iraq is tightening frighteningly,\nMr. Saddam Hussein is selecting targets for total destruction in the event of\nan armed conflict.\n\n\nHis beligerent rhetoric is provoking the U.S. to concentrate on a\nmilitary solution which, fortunately for the world, was not countenanced by\nthe Big-Two Summit in Helsinki.\n\n\nBut  irrational intransigence is making a military\nsolution inevitable with all its unpredictable consequences.\n\n\nThe impending cataclysm can be averted if Mr. Saddam Hussein sees the\nwriting on the wall and acts accordingly.\n\n\nIf he does not withdraw his troops from Kuwait, they are sure to be\nthrown out, whatever the price the world has to pay for such action.  <*>\na line in centre </*>\n\n\n  The boozy priest  \n\n \n\nSorrow laced with an overdose of liquor made a South African\npriest tumble into the grave at a funeral in Mbabane last week.\n\n\nThe deathly fall, which occurred after the coffin had been lowered,\nsent shockwaves through the group of mourners at the grave.\n\n\nThe family of the deceased has accused the clergyman of being drunk\nand said that he shook like a leaf and mumbled the same songs over and over.\n\n\nThe condition of the sorrowing priest was such that he had to be\nreplaced.\n\n\nBut that was a hasty step.\n\n\nNone of the accusers tried to understand the intensity of the  grief.\n\n\nThe priest has admitted that he was not aware of what he was doing\nthat day because of sorrow.\n\n\nIf he was drunk, it was because he wanted to drown his sorrow in\nliquor.\n\n\nThe fdw drops that he had on the sly before the funeral proved to be\na strong propellent.\n\n\nIt is difficult for the poor in spirit to rise to the spiritual\nheights of the priest.\n\n\nDuring the funeral, he seemed to have floated helplessly in the sea\nof sorrow.\n\n\nHis fall into the grave indicates that he, in sympathy with the\ndeparted soul, was prepared to shuffle off his mortal coil.\n\n\nBut the unspirutuous mourners could not appreciate the spiritual\nhigh drama of the boozy priest.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "32a0f640-90b0-4b66-b46d-baaefd6158e7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.108431+00:00"}

{"text": "Imparting concreteness to good intentions  \n\n \n\nA GROWING AWARENESS of the inadequacy of the development effort\nand, in particular, of the raw deal meted out to the rural poor underlies\nthe National Front  search for a strategy in the\neconomic sphere.\n\n\nTime is not obviously on the side of a minority government in the\nmatter of sculpting a model that will not fail to close the gap between the\nurban upper and middle income groups and the predominant rural population\ncaught in economic deprivation.\n\n\nNor is it inherently logical to expect a quick breakaway from a path\npursued over the last four decades, one which was characterised largely by\nthe funneling of the investible resources into modernisation, whether in\nagriculture, industry or the associated service sector.\n\n\nThe action plan of the V. P. Singh Government, released at the dawn\nof the New year, stresses the commitment to the objective of shifting the\ncentre of gravity of the process of development to rural India.\n\n\nThe central element of the new strategy is that, from the annual plan\nfor 1990-91,  \" at least 50 per cent of investible resources\" \nwill be canalised into the agricultural and rural sector.\n\n\nHow exactly can this be brought about and what kinds of policy\npackage would be needed?\n\n\nIf budgetary experience has any lessons to offer, the point needs to\nbe made that, during the first four years of the Seventh Plan period, the\ntotal outlay on agriculture, rural development, irrigation and flood\ncontrol, has not been more than 25 per cent of the aggregate expenditure.\n\n\nIt may not be difficult to redesign plan accounting to provide\nsegregated data relating to the rural compolnent in such categories as\nsocial services, transport and energy.\n\n\nBut the quantum of resources pumped into the rural areas in the\npast has been such that the proposed enlargement of outlay will mean a\ncolossal addition to it.\n\n\nThe annual plan outlay of the Centre for 1989-90, for instance, was\nbudgeted at  Rs.  34,446  crores,  of which the\nexplicit rural share was hardly  Rs.  3,500  crores.\n\n\n\nAssuming that the outlay for the first year of the Eighth Plan\nwill be stepped up by 20 per cent, what the resolve of the Government will\nimply is that additional resources of at least  Rs.  15,000\n crores  will have to be made to flow into the rural sector.\n\n\nIt is all very well to pledge bigger support for the needed\nrevitalisation of agriculture and the rural living conditions in general.\n\n\nThe critical lacuna in the policy, as has often been the case in\nthe past, is an integrated multi-sector startegy whereby employment,\nincome and consumption expenditure can be raised along with - - or even as\na precursor of - - a larger availability of wage goods.\n\n\nAn action plan without specific details about how the requisite\nstrategy will be set in motion might end up the way  ad hoc\n employment generation schemes such as NREP, IRDP and RLEGP have\ndone, that is to say, scatter financial resources over a wide area ( with the\nconcomitant diversions of funds into unauthorised and illlicit channels)\nwithout endowing the poor with land or other assets or strenghtening the\nemployment-wages structure. \n\n \n\nThe action plan does encompass land reforms, the expansion of\nthe network of rural warehouses and a comprehensive national housing policy\nwhich can itself set the pace for a host of developmental stimuli in the\nrural areas.\n\n\nBut given the fact that land reforms have been thwarted over the\nyears through the dilution of ceiling laws, the notorious absence of\nauthentic land records and the extensive resort to  benami \ntransactions, it would be a mistake to hope for any dramatic redistribution\nof land among the landless peasants.\n\n\nIn any case, one has to contend with the basic shortage of\ncultivable land in relation to the population.\n\n\nA decision to strengthen the system of farm price support\nshould be taken with a view not only to compensating the agricultural\nproducers for inflation and the higher wage cost entailed in the new\npolicy line but also to making the remunerative price an abiding reality.\n\n\nIt will then help serve as a key corrective to the accumulated\ndistortions in the terms of trade which have dampened investments in\nagriculture.\n\n\nWhat will the increased official flow of funds into the rural economy\ncombined with remunerative prices presage for the urban industrial and\nservice sectors?\n\n\nA new regime of cost push inflation?\n\n\nA chronic shortage of capital with the conse quent slowdown of\nindustrial activity?\n\n\nIf budgetary deficits are contained firmly and the exportimport\npolicy framework is effectively geared to serving the twin needs of import\nsubstitution and export diversification, there is no inevitability about a\nrural thrust operating to the detriment of an expanding industrial system.\n\n\nNor need there be any apprehensions about investible savings not\nbeing generated at an adequate rate.\n\n\nThe promise of a new long term fiscal policy apart, what ought to\nguide the Planning Commission and the Government from now onwards is a vision\nof national economic well being built around the regeneration of the hope\nof concrete benefits rather than the mere raising of expectations among all\nsections of the people. \n\n\n  A long way to go  \n\n \n\nFEW AMONG THE Opposition in Myanmar ( Burma) will be inclined\nto see the  decision to relax martial law in the\ntroubled regions of Mandalay and Sagaing and the removal of restrictions on\nfive politicians as a step towards democracy.\n\n\nGiven the tactics adopted by the State Law and Order Restoration\nCouncil ( SLORC) in the last few months, the latest development will be\nviewed as nothing more than a public relations exercise, partly intended\nto convince the people and the international community at large that\nelections slated for May 27 are proceeding according to schedule.\n\n\nThe real question is the extent to which the polls are going to be\nfree and fair with the government guaranteeing the participation of all\nthe political parties irrespective of their relationship to the military\nauthorities.\n\n\nEven in the context of the latest partial relaxation of martial\nlaw, it is said that the regime was forced to move in that direction in the\nface of small but determined protests in parts of Mandalay.\n\n\nThat things are far from normal is seen from the fact that the\nmilitary has the  ` legal'  sanction to enforce curfew, ban\ngroups of more than five people gathering, besides restricting freedom of\nspeech and political discussion.\n\n\nSilencing dissent by placing Opposition politicians under house\narrest has become quite common - - witness, for instance, the curbs placed on\nthe former Prime Minister, Mr. U Nu, late last month.\n\n\nAnd the treatment meted out to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi of the National\nLeague for Democracy has been no different - - apart from keeping her under\nhouse arrest since July last year, the military brass has, from time to time,\nindicated that she may be put on trial. \n\n \n\nIf the regime in Myanmar is really serious about doing away with\nthe harsh laws and setting in motion a genuine democratic course, it has to\ndo away totally with the martial law, and that too before the May elections.\n\n\nElections under controlled conditions will certainly not be\nacceptable to the people, much less the comity of nations.\n\n\nDetaining Opposition politicians under one pretext or another or\nsentencing them to prison terms is hardly the way to go about ushering in\nqualitative changes in the political system.\n\n\nOf what use are the polls if people like Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi are not\nallowed to take part?\n\n\nAnd putting her to trial before the polls on filmsy and trumped up\ncharges will only make matters worse.\n\n\nArguing that foreign powers are trying to disintegrate the state\nunder  \" a new form of colonialism\"  is not going to work, for\nthe SLORC is yet to refute international allegations on human rights abuses\nin any meaningful fashion.\n\n\nThe leadership may want to believe that they have got over the\ninternational economic pressure by signing contracts with foreign firms for\nthe exploration of oil and for the exploitation of natural resources.\n\n\nThis may have augmented or even improved the \nforeign exchange reserves but the strategy is bound to go nowhere from a\nlonger term perspective.\n\n\nForeign debt is estimated at around\n\n$5 billions with about two-thirds of this owed to Japan and West Germany; and\nthere is hardly any indication of these two nations writing off the loans\nunless repression ends and political reforms are instituted.\n\n\nMore than the international economic or political pressure, the\nmilitary rulers in Myanmar would do well to keep in mind what went on the\nEastern Europe and other parts of the world in the last three years where\nthen inability of leaderships to gauge the popular mood led to to their\ndownfall.\n\n\nEven the powerful armed forces in a few societies joined the\nmovements for democracy, hastening the exit of authoritarian regimes. \n\n\n\n\n\n  Eighth Plan uncertainities  \n\n \n\nTHE EIGHTH PLAN has had a chequered course right from the\nbeginning.\n\n\nThe finalisation of the document has been unduly delayed because\nof the changes in government and differing approaches to the issues\ninvolved.\n\n\nIt had been hoped that the Chandra Shekhar Government at least\nwould enable the Planning Commission to complete its work and the document\nwould be approved by the National Development Council before the end of\nthe month.\n\n\nBut new uncertainties have crept in with the exit of the Chandra\nShekhar Government.\n\n\nIt is  guess what will be the eventual size and\ncontent of the Plan.\n\n\nThere has however been no Plan holiday, though the progress made in\n1990-92 may not be at the desired rate and a big effort would have to be made\nin subsequent years to reach the high targets visualised by various\nworking groups. \n\n \n\nThe progress in financial terms in 1990-91 has of course been\nsatisfactory having regard to the resources crunch and changes of horses mid\nstream.\n\n\nThe total outlay of the Central and State Governments and Union\nTerritories is actually higher at  Rs.  65,002 \ncrores  in the revised estimate for 1990-91 against  Rs.\n 64,716.80  crores  ( budget).\n\n\nBut there has been a shortfall in Plan expenditure in the Central\nsector and only a marginal increase in the share of the States.\n\n\nThe Union Territories have accounted for the bulk of the rise, their\nexpenditure being  Rs.  2,348  crores  against\n Rs  1,071  crores. \n\n\nThe shortfall in outlay in the Central sector has made it difficult\nfor even the modest physical targets to be realised.\n\n\nWith the paucity of resources and mounting non-Plan expenditure,\nthe prospects for 1991-92 too were not encouraging.\n\n\nBut the need for executing ongoing schemes and sustaining the tempo,\nalbeit on a lower key, has been responsible for the decision to increase\nthe public sector Plan allocation by 10.9 per cent over the revised outlay\nfor 1990-91.\n\n\nWhile the Centre will be stepping up its spending by 10.8 per cent to\n Rs.  42,148  crores,  the States and the Union\nTerritories will be incurring higher expenditure of  Rs. \n29,300  crores  against  Rs.  26,950 \ncrores.  \n\n \n\nHaving regard to the double digit inflation and slow start for\nthe Plan, a higher financial target should have been fixed.\n\n\nBut the inadequacy of funds is posing serious limits and other\nagencies will have to be in the picture for achieving the higher growth rate\nof six per cent now being contemplated.\n\n\nHowever, the projects relating to the power, coal, oil, railways\nand steel sectors will be accounting for over 50 per cent of the available\nfunds, though there is greater reliance on internally generated resources\nof public sector enterprises and borrowing.\n\n\nThe budgetary support for Plan schemes has thus increased only\nslightly.\n\n\nThe schemes of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission, Oil India and\nothers will, as before, be financed largely by owned and borrowed funds.\n\n\nThis will be feasible as profits are at high levels.\n\n\nThe projects of the Steel Authority of India and others too will get\nmodest assistance from the Government and the balance will have to be found\nfrom within and outside.\n\n\nDoes it mean that there will be an increase in prices for steel\nproducts?\n\n\nThe Railways have been given a raw deal as only in their case the\nallocation will be lower than in the current financial year.\n\n\nIn view of the latest developments, it is unlikely that there will be\nany increase in the size of the Annual Plan and much will depend on how\nthe private and joint sectors are helped to play an important role in\ntaking up projects in the core sector.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source":

Das notes that this practice was endorsed even more\nstrictly by his successor, Raja Prataprudra by means of a stone\ninscription in 1500 A. D.\n\n\nThis ordered that the troupes of dancing girls allowed to perform in\nthe temples would learn no other song and perform to no text other than the\n Gita Govinda  .\n\n\n \" If any temple functionary allows any other song or dance to\nbe performed, be it known that he is a traitor to Jagannath.\"  \n\n \n\nOne wishes some such directive had been given to the soloists who\ntook the floor on the second day of the  \" Gita Govinda\" \nfestival at Kamani organised by The Centre for Indian Classical Dances\nand VST Industries in their ongoing \" The Spirit of Freedom\nConcerts \" this week.\n\n\nIt would have maintained the conceptual clarity and vigour that\nwas evident on the first day, a kind of dance theatre on the full text\nperformed in three classical styles, Odissi by Sonal Mansingh,\nBharatnatyam by Laxmi Vishwanathan and Kathakali by Sadanam Balakrishnan.\n\n\nThe four styles presented on the second day lost sight of the main\nfocus. \n\n \n\nThe dramatic structure of the  Gita Govinda  , a\ncast of three main characters, viz. Krishna, Radha and the  Sakhi\n and a time span of a little more than two days, was tailor-made for\nSonal, Laxmi and Sadanam even though the styles are not.\n\n\nThe Kathakali Krishna is a far cry from the usual \nShringara-  laden Krishnas we see in the other forms.\n\n\nAnd initially the awakwardness felt by Balakrishnan when Sonal\naddressed to him love plaints like the immortal  \" Kuru\nYadunandana\"  transmitted itself across the boards to the viewer.\n\n\nBut luckily such moments were few and far in between.\n\n\nWhat mattered was the excellent use of space by the three, alone, in\nduets or together.\n\n\nAs against  stress on drama and  abhinaya\n to the word, Odissi steps into the very well-spring of \n \" bhava\"   .\n\n\nHere Sonal was not only the archetypal Radha, sullen, sulking and\nfinally sublimationally sorrowful but she kept her  abhinaya \ndistinct from that of  , herself a superb example of\ncontrolled mime.\n\n\nSuccess belonged to the evening because on one element or person\ntried to monopolise it.\n\n\nWith each line of the   Kavya   , sung by\nthe three different orchestras with only the Kathakali drums remaining\nmidstream throughout, the slim story got fleshd out appropriately.\n\n\nThe little masterpiece starts with the words of Nanda, pointing to\nthe sky dark with clouds and the  Tamla  trees that\noverhang the forest and make the night menacing.\n\n\nHe orders Radha to take Krishna home.\n\n\nThus starts an odyssey of love and desire,  \" their secret\npassion triumphing on the banks of the river Yamuna\"  followed by\nseparation and misunderstanding.\n\n\nLike the tireless  Sakhi  , we, the audience, too,\nare buffeted from Radha to Krishna and back again. \n\n \n\nLike her, we too are relieved when they are finally united and\nafter a night of love Radha asks her lower to  \" Paint my breast with\nleaf designs/Put colour on my cheeks/Fasten the girdle around my hips\"\n .\n\n\nAnd on Wednesday the fine music, the aesthetical matching of\ndifferent styles and the tasteful use of sensuousness made the unending\ncontroversies over the erotica in the poetics and rhetorics of the\n Gita Govinda  , the  Atma-Parmatama  angle as\nagainst the straightforward love poetry of Jayadeva, quite immaterial. \n\n \n\nIf the second day, then, featuring a bevy of young dancers doing\nan obligatory  ashtapadi  and then back to business as\nusual didn't quite impress the reason is obvious.\n\n\nSomething like the Amrushatakam experiment would have helped bring\nout the comparisons and contrasts of the different styles and dancers better.\n\n\nWithin that observation, Ram  Kathak, Vijayalaxmi  Mohiniattam and  Kuchipudi showed each\none as a master or mistress of the chosen form. \n\n \n\nEarlier, the first ever Maori dance troupe from New Zealand\nsaddened one by pinpointing what happens when living cultures are reduced to\nsharpnels of   \" Tamashbeeni\"   , something\nprepaid and packaged for export consumption.\n\n\nEven in their present highly sanitised form, the Maoris gave a\nglimpse of their rich culture, its stress on muscular and cerebral\ncoordination, a prime facet of early  life, juggling balls\nand pom-poms, sticks and banners with native dexterity.\n\n\nIt helped one forget the mechanical parts.  \n\n <box>\n\n\n  Arts & Culture   </box> \n\n\n  Priyadarshini is top class   <*> line from left\nto right, column one and two </*>\n\n\n  Dance  / Shanta Serbjeet Singh  <*> line from\nleft to right, column one and two </*> \n\n \n\n  NEW   Artistes Forum, run\ndancer Tarveen Mehra and aesthete N. Srinivasan is one of the newer\ncultural bodies on the  art circuit.\n\n\nYet, within the space of a few years, it has created a sound image\nfor its programmes.\n\n\nThere is much talk about merit these days.\n\n\nAlas, it is limited to the academic world and few recognise the\nthoughtless way in which media blows up stereotyped images, largely of\nmediocrity, in the cultural field.\n\n\nThe meritorious young are excluded from the celebrity spectacles\nwhich big    business   firms sponsor\nprecisely because as yet they have no name.\n\n\nBut there lies the rub.\n\n\nAs prem Shankar Jha, writing on the subject asks:  \" Where\nthen does the budding musician or dancer of the next generation perform?\n\n\nHow does he or she build a reputation so that one day he or she too\ncan join the gilded band of celebrities?\n\n\nAnd if they cannot be sure of a steady living and an equally\nsteady rise to prominence in step with their own growing maturity, why should\nthey remain in the arts at all?\"  \n\n \n\nThat is the kind of vacuum that New Artistes Forum is trying to\nfill and by bringing Priyardarshini Govind from Madras to the city for a\nBharatnatyam recital on Sunday, at India International Centre, it earned\nitself a rare bouquet of praise.\n\n\nSo what is so special about this young, tall, slim, Malavika\nSarrukai-look alike?\n\n\nEverything.\n\n\nFor one thing her  Nritta  is amazingly impeccable.\n\n\nFor another, she has the most complete grasp of  \nSatvikabhinaya   that one has seen in her generation.\n\n\nNo wonder her  abhinaya guru  , Kalanidhi Narayanan\nswears by her.\n\n\nOn Sunday she was competently accompanied by her other  guru\n , S. K. Rajaratnam, who has provided the foundation of her excellent\ntechnique.\n\n\nVocal support was by Vijayalakshmi and  mridangam  by\nP. Kannan. \n\n \n\nTaking each and every item of a traditional repertoire, from\nthe  Varnam  to the  Tillana  , a composition\nof Lalgudi Jayaraman, she showed her class by making it appear so fresh,\nso vibrant and so aesthetically perfect as to immediately make one sit up.\n\n\nEven her  Praveshiki  and her exits had a stamp of\nassurance that prepared the viewer for the way in which she framed each\n adavu  and  teermanam  in the perfect\nspatial sense.\n\n\nFor instance, the   Paiccal  adavu  in\nher hands had an ethereal lightness as the body jumped, leapt and then\nreturned to the  Mandala Sthana  without veering a micro point\nfrom the correctness of the left hand in the  Katamukha \nposition, the right curving in the  Alapadma  position\nbefore the foot landed.\n\n\nAnd the repeats in all directions were equally perfect. \n\n \n\nAnd to say that her  abhinaya  scored over her\n Nritta  is only to repeat onself.\n\n\nThe  Padam  in  Saveri  , in which the\n Nayika  sends the  Dooti  with her love\nmessage, followed by the  Jhaveli  in which she realises that\nboth her friend and confidante and her lover have doublecrossed her, were\nevery inch the proper and fit vehicles of expression of an  Uttama\nNayika  .\n\n\nThe emotion was subtle and yet strong, the  \nnetrabhinaya   so intense as to travel across the\nproscenium stage and into far corners of the hall.\n\n\nThe  Krishnakarnamrita Shlokas  in  Jog\nKauns, Hamsanandi, Kalavati  and  Sindhu Bhairavi \npresented  Vatsalaya  and  Shringara Rasas \nin an unusual shading.\n\n\nThe  Tillana  brougt the concert to a most fulfilling\nend, a point at which the young  costume was like a wet\nsheath, for there had been no break for costume change, but the audience felt\na warm glow at the thought that the future of our arts was safe even if there\nare a handful of young dancers like priyadarshini Govind around.  \n\n  <*> Line from left to right </*>\n\n\n  Uninspiring  Lok Utsav    <*>\nLine from left to right, two columns </*>  Dance  / Shanta\nSerbjeet Singh <*> line from left to right, two columns </*>\n\n \n\n  RITUALISTIC   , esoteric, plain\ngymnastic - - the folk dances of India are all this and more.\n\n\nIn their journey to the 20th century from the days of the Sanskrit\ntheatre, much may have been lost.\n\n\nFar more surprising, however, is the amount that has been retained,\nfrom the convention of the   Indradhvaja purva-ranga \n , be it   Bhavai  or   Naqqal  , to the clearly discernible, if    only   roughly similar, zonal divisions   (\nKaksavibhaga)   of the Sanskrit stage.\n\n\nAlso the same is the use of the   Sutradhara \n and the   Vidusaka   , linking the many\nplots of the performance, providing the chorus and interpreting the earthy\nconcerns of the present in the light of the encouragingly similar squabbles\nand pursuits of the gods.\n\n\nTraditionally they have done this with innovative strength and bold\nunconcern for stepping on the toes of the great and the mighty. \n\n \n\nBut if Prem Chand Naqqal and    Stree\nVeshas   had vigorous dancing by the all-men cast as well as\nsome sharp comment by the singer - -  Vidusaka  , its tawdry\nuse of wigs and falsies et al was largely symptomatic of the declining level\nof aesthetics as witnessed in this   Lok Utsav\n organised annually by the  Sangeet Natak  Akademy\nsince 1984.\n\n\nDespite the enthusiastic house-fulls that came to the open-air\nRabindra Bhavan stage to watch performers from all parts of India, there\nwas a tired and mechanistic air about both the artistes and the organisers.\n\n\nIt seemed like yet another ritual to be gone through on the\ncalendar, without any effort to enable the media to go a bit deeper into\nthe background of the participants through a Press conference or fuller\nprogramme notes. \n\n \n\nEven within a form, let alone the performers, there was much\nunevenness.\n\n\nThus excellent  Mappilappattu  singing marked the\nmonotonous dancing by the Kozhikode Mappila Kala Academy.\n\n\nThe form was  Oppana  , a marriage ritual dance of the\nnorthern Malabar region of Kerala.\n\n\nIts curiosity value, of course, lay in the fact that it is a dance of\nthe Muslims and uses clapping and gently swaying movements of the women in\na circular formation with the bride-to-be seated in the centre. \n\n \n\nAs before, the surprise lay in the variations on the theme of\nmartial art exercises and gymnastics that slowly evolve into stylised dance.\n\n\nThe   paikakhadas   of villages in Orissa,\nperformed by the  Birupakshi Paik Akhada  was a\nthrowback to the days of the peasant militia under the command of the kings\nof Orissa.\n\n\nAt its core lies physical culture and   akhada  -\nstyle  gymnastics.\n\n\nVery similar to the  Thang Ta  of Manipur was the way\nthey used the stick or the  lath  to slice a gourd placed on\nthe  chest or - - its more suspenseful variation - - crack\na coconut balanced on the  \"  \"  head. \n\n \n\nFrom somersaults to using each    body as\nladders, the group had a lot in its repertory.\n\n\nBut at the end of it, one had the distinct feeling that some members\nhad been roped in at the last minute.\n\n\nThe Dangi dance, by Shivaji Kapru Bhoye and his group, made good use\nof the  Kahalya  and the  Dholki  for its\nrhythmic and figurative patterns.\n\n\nBoth here and in the  PaikaAkhada  forms, there is\ninteresting use of circular and pyramidic formations.\n\n\nQuite different in every way is the traditional  Perini\nShiva Thandavam  form, on the borderline of classical and folk.\n\n\nWith the accompaniment of excellent singing, the four dancers gave\na rousing display of their foot-work and animated use of the body, as in\nKuchipudi.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the  Veeragasse  , by Basavaraj\nNellisaera and party was mechanistic in the stance and thrust, despite the\nlarge size of the contingent.\n\n\nAnd the use of Ambassador car hubcaps as  \" shields\"\n , with handles welded in, were part of  scenario of\nlack of attention to detail. \n\n \n\nFor lack of space last week the notice of Geeta  performance at IIC on the occasion of Papanasan \nbirth centenary, had to be omitted.\n\n\nGeeta performed a full Bharat Natyam repertoire on the  work.\n\n\nThis of course, is always more of a handicap than an aid.\n\n\nDance has a multitude of emotional hues and saint poets like\nPappanasan Sivan rarely allow the dancer to move out of the restricted space\nof  Bhakti Rasa  .\n\n\nIf despite this, Geeta impressed, specially in the\narchitectonically constructed  Varnam  in Sivaranjani, it was\ndue to the hard work put in by her of late.\n\n\nAnd that contributed by her  guru  , K.

{"text": "Madhao Patil  \n\n\n  A STUDY OF FEMINIST MOVEMENT IN POST-WAR AMERICA \n\n\n \n\nFeminist Movement characterises social history of post-war America\nin true sense, for, no other single movement influenced American society and\nculture as deeply as it seems to have done.\n\n\nIt surfaced in early sixties-unnoticed, unannounced, taking whole\nnation by surprise. \n\n \n\nWomen took jobs in increasing number throughout forties and\nfifties with a view to acquire middle class status by supplementing family\nincome  .\n\n\nHowever, with growing participation in labour force came growing\nrealisation of heavy discrimination based on sex in matter of job, wage and\npromotion.\n\n\nAs it was typically a female problem, their continued participation in\nCivil Right Movement wouldn't have helped them in successfully overcoming\nit.\n\n\nResponding to demands of circumstances, educated middle class women\nlaunched a movement of their own with foundation of National Organization of\nWomen, in 1960, to secure them social, economic and personal freedom  .\n\n\nTheir movement picked up quick momentum and spread rapidly without any\ngovernment encouragement or patronage. \n\n \n\nAs feminist movement progressed, its aims and perceptions changed\ndistinctly.\n\n\nIt acquired aggressive stances by mid sixties demanding day care\ncentres, women health collectives, repeal of abortion laws and absolute\nequality with men in all respects  .\n\n\nIts attitude towards men in general shifted from being that of\nstrength and sisterhood in sixties to hard edged anger and animosity by late\nseventies.\n\n\n advocacy of selfrespecting partnership with men at\nearlier stage gave way to stiff resistence to what they perceived as male\nchauvanism.\n\n\nThey not only condemned their treatment as mere sex object but went a\nstep further in eighties to demand control of their own productive life\nthrough contraception and abortion.\n\n\nReinterpretation of Bible from feminist point of view became one of\ntheir pet demands  . \n\n\n  THE RESPONSES :  \n\n \n\nThe Feminist movement drew positive response on various fronts.\n\n\nTo begin with, Congress passed Civil Right Act in 1964, which\nprohibited discrimination based on sex or race.\n\n\nAs a result, the classified advertisements   \nslowly   started dropping the words  ` men wanted' \nand  ` women wanted'  . \n\n\nState and Federal laws prohibited various kinds of discriminations\nagainst women.\n\n\nThe equal credit    opportunity  \nAct banned sex bias in granting of credits.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court, in its historical decision in 1973, upheld the\nfeminist demand of right of abortion. \n\n\nOn executive front, the Federal Government, initiated Affirmative\nAction programs to end sex based discrimination in appointments and\npromotions.\n\n\nSupreme Court ruled against Foreign Service Examination on grounds\nthat it discriminated against women, as a result, the State Department\ncancelled the examination in 1989.  \n\n\n  BACK LASH :  \n\n \n\nThe Feminist movement provoked a back lash particularly in  .\n\n\nRight to life advocates vociferously demanded an    anti-abortion   constitutional amendment.\n\n\nFederal   \n\n\nGovernment curtailed welfare aid meant to finance abortion. \n\n\nIn 1989, Supreme Court reversed the   \nhistorical   decision of ' 73 and ruled out in favour of state\nrestrictions on abortions.\n\n\nSimilarly, the concept of positive discrimination and Affirmative\nAction Programme came to be challenged exceedingly in Supreme Court.\n\n\nThe states like Pensilvania passed laws against abortions.  \n\n\n  ACHIEVEMENTS :  \n\n \n\nOne of direct and substantial achievements of feminist movement\nwas in area of employment.\n\n\nThe women participation in labour-force, more than doubled up between\n1960-90.\n\n\nIn certain age group and in certain jobs, it not only equalled male\nnumber but exceeded it.\n\n\nMore important, the women entered in bigger number, the jobs defined\nhistorically as exclusively male such as medicine, engineering, law,\narchitect, managerial, and administrative occupations. \n\n\nThe doors of army, police, Firebrigade were thrown open to them.\n\n\nUnder Carter administration ( 1976-80) the women were recruited in\nevery branch of army, and under Bush administration ( 1988-92) they were\nactually involved as Fighters in Gulf War in 1992.\n\n\nIn sports, she made history in 1993 by entering what was always\nregarded as exclusively male domain-Boxing.\n\n\nSandra Day O Conner, became the first women Supreme Court Judge in\n1982.\n\n\nSally Ride shot to fame as the first woman astronaut in 1983.\n\n\nBarbara Harris, a black divorcee civil right activist was first woman\nto become Bishop in 1989.  \n\n \n\nFeminist movement created growing realisation on part of both\nFederal and State administration that it could not sidetrack or be\nindifferent to women in implementing Civil Right Policies.\n\n\nIn political arena, the women power got acknowledged through the\nhistorical nomination of Geraldine Ferraro by Democratic party for Vice\nPresident in Presidential Election of  \n\n \n\nFeminist movement also helped women psychologically.\n\n\nTechnological advancement, particularly, the rapid computerisation,\n   depersonalised   the work, restricting\nthe scope for human interaction.\n\n\nThis resulted into a deep sense of growing loneliness which affected\nthe individual life.\n\n\nThe feminist movement, particularly in  became a\npowerful instrument to ally - loneliness inducing a sense of belonging.\n\n\nIt helped women free themselves of many of  \n constraints   which worked against them in past in realm of\npersonal freedom, self-realisation and autonomy. \n\n\n\n  LIMITATIONS AND FAILURES :  \n\n \n\nThe main and primary goal of equality, remains unfulfilled to\ngreat extent so far.\n\n\nTo begin with, ERA is yet to be ratified in case of employment, job\nand professions.\n\n\nMen do have a distinct edge over women in matters of wages and\npromotions.\n\n\nMen professionals in    engineering \n ,    medicine   , architect receive about\n25-30 percent more than what their female counterpart do and also get -\npromotions comparatively quicker. \n\n\nIn journalism schools women outnumber men but so far salaries are\nconcerned, former make about 40 percent less than later. \n\n\nNo major Media Company is headed by women, perhaps with sole\nexception of Washington Post, but, in this case, Katharin Graham handed it to\none of her sons and not her daughters. \n\n\nJudith Martin ( Miss Manners) described her job as copy girl in\nWashington Post as  \" momentus work with terrible hours and featuring\na take home pay of\n\n$ 27.50 a week and the opportunity to get screamed a lot  \"  \n .\n\n\nGarmire, one of 21 women in the 1564 member National Academy of\nEngineering, was only the second woman to become the President of optical\nsociety of America in 1991 in the 77 years old organization  .\n\n\nThough it is true that many jobs were thrown open to women yet over\n80  percent of female workers were\nconcentrated in 20 out of 420 occupations listed by Census Bureau.  \n\n \n\nA proper study and critical evaluation of feminist movement needs\ntaking into consideration two simultaneous developments - sexual revolution\nand a phenomenon of feminisation of poverty - which together with first \n  ( i.e.   feminist movement) not only proved highly\ndetrimental and harmful to women themselves but rocked the very foundation of\nAmerican family and culture.\n\n\nSexual Revolution had roots in what educated and earning women\nperceived as  \" male dominated repressive and antierotic culture.\"\n \n\n\nGripped by a strong streak of permissiveness and pervertism, many\nAmericans lost faith and interest in sanctity of marriage institution.\n\n\nAs a result, number of unmarried couples shot to 1.5 million in 1980,\ndivorce rate climbed up 100 percent between 1960-80, female headed households\ndoubled up between 1970-90 and those female headed households with children\nincreased by 7 percent in ' 70s. \n\n\nThis led to a phenomenon of feminisation of poverty.\n\n\nMost of 11 million children who received assistance in 1980 under\nAids to families with dependent children belonged to female headed\nhouseholds. \n\n\nConsider this data which reflects growing negligence of children\ncaused by disintegration of family.\n\n\nIn 1950s in 70 percent families father worked and mother took care of\nchildren.\n\n\nIn 1980s, this was true about only 15 percent of families.\n\n\nIn 1983, 13 percent children prepared their own meals and this\npercentage rose by 23 percent in next ten years.\n\n\nThe juvenile crime rate doubled up between 1960-80 and about 90\npercent juvenile offenders came from single parent family.  \n\n \n\nUnder combined impact of feminist movement and sexual revolution,\nthe family institution collapsed.\n\n\nWhite woman suffered.\n\n\nBlack one suffered more.\n\n\nIn 80, the number of white female headed families rose to 14 percent\nbut that of black female headed familes rose to 47 percent.\n\n\nOne out of every three black children was born to a teenage mother.\n\n\n55% of all black babies were born out of wedlock but in inner city\nGhetoes the figure often climbed up above 70 percent.  \n\n\n  CAUSES OF FAILURE OF FEMINIST MOVEMENT :  \n\n \n\nFeminist movement suffered from lack of uniform support base\namong women.\n\n\nNational Federation of  clubs and League of women\nvoters took opposite views on basic issues such as Equal Right Amendement,\nRight to live etc.\n\n\nThey usually followed individual pattern in voting unlike black\nvoters who voted in block.\n\n\nIt was quite evident in voting pattern in Presidential election of\n84.\n\n\nElectoral strategy of Democratic Party to cash in on women power by\nroping in a woman candidate dashed to pieces.\n\n\nIn a survey before election, 16 percent women said they would not\nvote democratic party because of her whereas 68 percent said her nomination\nmade no difference.\n\n\nIn fact majority of women voted for Reagan. \n\n \n\nAs the Feminist movement progressed some of the basic but\ncontroversial issues such as right of abortion came to be politicized and\nblown out of proportion to such an extent that the human spirit behind it got\ntotally distorted. \n\n \n\nSimilarly, certain international development such as    hike   in oil prices in early seventies adversly affected\nthe jobs which came to be defined exclusively as  .\n\n\nMore important, as feminist movement progressed it developed a\nconflict over the cultural assumption of traditional role of woman as mother\nbecause of transformation of female labour force.\n\n\nThe percentage of married women in employment rose from 15 in 1940 to\n80 in 1970 and that of mothers with small children in employment rose from 0\nto 50 percent.   \n\n\n  THE ROLE OF WOMEN :  \n\n \n\nMany social scientists, both male and female, blame women for the\nnegative stances, feminist movement took there by causing much damage to\nAmerican social and cultural fiber.\n\n\nThe main thrust of criticism against the movement is, it brought a\nshift in values. \n\n\nThat, they ran after materialism recklessly.\n\n\nThey mistook status, money, power as reward in themselves.\n\n\nThe counter culture feminist and radicals denounced a family as\n ` a secret suicide pact'  and an  ` ideological\nconditioning devices in any exploitive society'  .\n\n\nBetty Fridman, founder of \" NOW \" , compared\nAmerican Home to  ` Comfortable Concentration Camp'  and\nappealed women to free    themselves   from\nit. \n\n\nSome of  the  virtues advocated by Greer in her celebrated\nwork, Sex and Destiny, such as chastity, selfcontrol, motherhood, extended\nfamily etc. remained sadly absent from what female activists    propagated   .\n\n\nPerhaps, she rightly hinted that American feminists were obssessively\ninterested in careers for women. \n\n\nCareer for sake of career, equality for sake of equality, freedom\nfor sake of freedom, proved ultimately not only meaningless but harmful too.\n\n\nCharles Krauthamer, in Pietygate School for scandle, wrote,\n \" Ferraro didn't get to where she is by dint of cause, ideology or\neven issue\"  . \n\n\nPerhaps this is also true of later development of feminist movement\nto some extent.\n\n\nIn the absence of meaningful philosophy, positive ideology, the\nfeminist movement couldn't sustain itself.\n\n\nFemale activists, in name of right and equality, forgetting their\ntrue identity, blindly imitated worst rather than best of male model, which\naccording to Anne Taylor Fleming  \" bodes ill certainly for women,\nprobably for men and for all children.\"  \n\n\n \n\nWhat kind of role feminist movement played in post-war America\nshattered by growing crisis, insane violence, abortion, drunken driving,\nhomosexuality, pervertism, drug abuse, rape and poronography ?\n\n\nAccording to Max Learner, the Feminist movement which assumed the\nshape of liberation movement, failed to solve  innermost\nproblems, instead gave them another and larger context and made them\nproblematic in different way.\n\n\nTo quote Mary Anna Dolan, the Feminist movement did fail in this\nrespect and failure of  movement is failure of women from\nwithin.  \n\n\n FOOT NOTES :

{"text": "Land Systems and Landforms of Chittoor District Andhra\nPradesh, India   \n\n\n S.T. Jaya Raju, S.V. Lingeswara Rao and K.L. Narasimha Rao \nDepartment of Geography, S.V. University, Tirupati, A.P. (\n\n\nReceived : January 1995 )   \n\n \n\n Chittoor district is located 12<*>degrees</*>\n37<*>seconds</*> to 14<*>degrees</*> 8<*>seconds</*> \" N \"\nand 78<*>degrees</*> 3<*>seconds</*> to 79<*>degrees</*> 55<*>seconds</*>\n\" E \" .\n\n\nIt is bordered by Anantapur, Cuddapah and Nellore districts in the\nnorth and by Tamil Nadu state in the south and east and by Karnataka state\ntowards the west ( Fig. 1 ) .\n\n\nIt is one of the four districts of Rayalaseema and located in the\nleeward side of the Western Ghats and hence became one of the rain-shadow\ndistricts of the State.\n\n\nIt spreads over an area of 15152 sq. km. \n\n\n  Land Systems  \n\n \n\nThe area under study lies in a transitional zone between the\ninterior plateau and the coastal plain.\n\n\nIn addition, the north-south running Eastern Ghat ranges run in the\nmiddle of the district forming its backbone and the water divide for many\nstreams.\n\n\nThe district may, conveniently, be divided into three natural\ndivisions. \n\n \n\n  The Western Hilly Region ( The Karnataka Plateau ) \n comprises isolated hills and hillocks covering the western part of the\ndistrict.\n\n\n \" The Central Upland Region \"  comprises\nthree ranges : ( 1)\n\n\nMahendragiri hills covering the taluks of \" Kuppam \"\n, \" Palamaneru \" , \" Chittoor \" , \"\nVayalpadu \" and \" Chinnagottigallu \" ; ( 2)\n\n\nThe southern portions of palakonda and Velikonda ranges partly\ncovering the taluks of \" Puttur \" , \" Nagari\n\" and \" Satyavedu \" .\n\n\n  the Plain Region   :\n\n\nIt consists of the valley plains of \" Bahuda \" ,\n\" Pincha \" , \" Palar \" , \"\nSwarnamukhi \" , \" Arani \" and \" Nagari\n\" rivers and the coastal plain which lies to the east of \"\nPalakonda \" and \" nagari \" hills. \n\n \n\nThe relief and land systems of the study area are delineated\nbased on studies of toposheets and false colour composites of \"\nLANDSAT \" .\n\n\nThe land Systems are delineated based on the assumption that similar\ngrey tones under similar topographic expressions reflect similar surface and\nsub-surface moisture conditions, vegetation and organic content of the soils.\n\n\nLight tones are considered to reflect red soils, colluvium and sands;\nmedium tones to reflect sandy soils to sandy loams on rolling plains; and\ndark tones to sandy, silty clays on level plains namely, flood plains,\nancient channels etc.\n\n\nThese tones may help in delineating areas of relative importance in\nlocating groundwater also.\n\n\nThe land system identified   are hilly terrain, undulating terrain, rolling plains, and fluvial\nplains ( Fig. 2 ) . \n\n\n  Hilly Terrain  \n\n \n\nThe western part of the district is bordered by a group of hills\nof the Eastern Ghats trending \" NE- \" \" NNE\n\" and \" SE \" direction.\n\n\nThese hills are composed mainly of granites, quartzites and\ncharnockites.\n\n\nThe general elevation in these hills ranges from 1,314 m, ( Horsely\nHills ) to 1,131 m, ( Tirumala Hills ) above MSL, with steep slopes extending\n2 per cent.\n\n\nField studies in these regions also throw light on differential\nweathering, paricularly in the regions where sections of folds are clearly\nexposed.\n\n\nThe general alignment of the disturbed hills in the western and\ncentral parts shows that this region in the geological history could have\nbeen a major domal structure and this contention has been upheld owing to the\npresence of general radial pattern of drainage' in the district.    \n\n\n  Undulating Terrain  \n\n \n\nThe central undulationg terrain constitutes the hilly slopes,\npiedmont plains, valley fills, pediplains and colluvial fans.\n\n\nThe presence of piedmont plains and colluvial fans with convex facing\nslopes is an evidence to show that the rate of accumulation exceeds that of\ntransportation. \n\n\n  Rolling Plains  \n\n \n\nThe slope in these plains is low and varies from 2 to 5 per cent\nor less than 2 per cent and constitutes creep-built plains, wash plains and\nmixed soil plains.\n\n\nThe rolling nature of the plains is attributed to differential rate\nof weathering, erosion and deposition of materials by gravity, stream and\nwind action.\n\n\nThe rolling plains occupy the major part of the district constituting\nred sandy soils, sandy loams and black soil plains and reflect low to medium\ngrey tones on the LANDSAT.\n\n\nA few isolated hills / inselbergs stand out prominently in the plains\nalong with outcrops and give hindrance to agricultual operations. \n\n\n  Fluvial Plains  \n\n \n\nThe major rivers during the course of their development of river\nvalleys have deposited fine-textured alluvial soils on either side of the\nbanks especially on the eastern part and as a result theis region is \n` somewhat plain'  in nature, with as lope less than 2 per cent.\n\n\nThese soils are very fertile and are usually used for cultivation of\nrice, sugarcane etc. as reflected in dark grey tones on \" LANDSAT\n\" ( band 7 ) . \n\n \n\nAs the western and central parts of the district composed of a\nnumber of hills aand hillocks with exposed outcrops, the panoramic view gives\nthe idea that it is more slopy and undulating.\n\n\nThe etymological study of some of the place names in the western part\nof the district may support this contention, for example, \"\nRallabuduguru \" ( means, a place with stones ) , \"\nBodabandla \" ( meaning a barren hill ) .\n\n\nSimilarly, the eastern part which is somewhat plain and low lying in\nnature, abounds with place names like  \" ` pallam' \"\n ( a low lying area ) ,  \" ` Thungundram' \"\n ( slope of a hill ) etc. \n\n\n  Landforms  \n\n \n\nThe various landforms ( Fig.3 ) , identified on the basis of grey\ntonal variation, crustal trends, nature of vegetation, soil texture and\ndrainage characteristics, etc., are classified into broad divisions according\nto major geomorphic processes involved in their formation. \n\n\n  Denudational Landforms  \n\n \n\nLandforms that are grouped under this category owe their origin\npredominantly to sheet movements of weathered material by erosion and\ndeposition.\n\n\nExogenetic processes, namely degradation, weathering, mass wasting\nand erosion have collectively played important roles in the destruction of\nthese landforms.\n\n\nAfter visiting various parts of the district it is concluded that\npredominantly mechanical weathering process dominates over chemical\nweathering process due to semi-arid nature of climate.\n\n\nDifferential weathering in different parts of the hilly terrain,\nparticularly in Horsely Hills, in the west and Nagari Hills in the east,\nthrows light on structural disturbances which have played significant role in\npartial destruction of granitic terrain in this part of the district. \n\n\n  Remnants of Planation Surfaces  \n\n \n\nRelatively flat topped gentle slopes with barren surface and\nisolated hills reflecting light to medium grey tones at an altitude of about\n750 m in the district are presumed to be some of the remnants of planation\nsurfaces.\n\n\nHowever, these surfaces are not associated with lateritic cappings in\nthe eastern part.\n\n\nA series of profiles taken in east-west direction ( Fig. 4 ) throw\nlight to the effect that there could have been four denudational levels,\nnamely, 150-300 m,       300-600 m,\nand 600-900, and above 900 m.\n\n\nLevels lying in between 150-300 m, 300-600 m and 600-900 m may\nindicate that they could have been planation surfaces. \n\n\n  Domal Hills  \n\n \n\n\" Domal hills \" are those broad warps in which\nthe rocks posses slight dips and appears nearly horizontal.\n\n\nThey sometimes have elliptical anticlines.\n\n\nSuch kind of domal hills are identified in \" LANDSAT\n\" ( band 7 ) as grey coloured patches. \n\n\n  Narrow and Elongated Ridges ( Dykes )  \n\n \n\n\" The Archaens \" in the district occupying\nnearly 60 per cent of the total area, mainly consists of \" schists\n\" , \" granites \" and \" gneisses \" .\n\n\nThey are generally intruded by quartz veins and dolerite dykes.\n\n\nThese dykes are found traversing the granitic rocks and look like\nlinear ridges.\n\n\nThey play vital role in controlling the movement of groundwater by\nacting as sub-suface dams and effectively stop the lateral movement of\ngroundwater. \n\n\n  Pediplains  \n\n Pediplanation is generally accepted as the process responsible for\nlandscape evolution as an alternative to the concept of process of\npeneplanation.\n\n\nA pediplain is also considered a plain resulting from coalescence of\na number of pediments over a sizable area developed by the process operating\nin a semi-arid cycle of denudation.\n\n\nIn the area under study, the pediplain is well marked on the northern\nand western parts of the district.\n\n\nThey are in continuation of the pediplain described by Vaidyanathan (\n4).\n\n\nThese plains in Chittoor District are covered by red sandy soils with\na few residual hills and they reflect very light tone in the \"\nLANDSAT \" ( band 7 ) . \n\n\n  Lateritic Uplands  \n\n \n\nUplands with lateritic cappings are observed in the eastern part\nof the district, where wet and dry conditions alternate. \n\n\n  Residual Hills  \n\n \n\nThe multicyclic residual mountains, namely exfoliation domes,\ntors, boulders and domal  hills are well distributed\nover the plains of piedmont colluvial plains, pediments and pediplains.\n\n\nTypical tors and boulders of \" granitic gneisses \"\nare numerous in the around the study area causing obstructions to\nagricultural operations. \n\n\n  Structural Landforms  \n\n\n  Hogbacks  \n\n \n\n\" Hogbacks \" are sharp crested ridges which\ndevelop where the rock dips are steep.\n\n\nIn the study area \" hogbacks \" are identified in the\nnorth-eastern part of the district. \n\n\n  Mesa / Butte  \n\n \n\n\" Mesa / Butte \" is an isolated table-land,\ncapped with protective covering which is essentially horizontal in attitude.\n\n\n\" Mesas / Buttes \" are identified in the eastern\npart of the district. \n\n\n  Escarpments  \n\n \n\nAn escarpment or scarp is defined as steep rock-face of great\nlength.\n\n\nTwo general types are recognised, namely, \" structural\n\" and \" erosional escarpments \" .\n\n\n\" Structural escarpment \" is a direct product of\nfault displacement.\n\n\nIn the study area, the Tirumala Hills, Nagari Hills, parts of Kuppam\nhills and other minor hill ranges show distinct steep escarpments, which run\nto a distance of about 2 to 5 km.\n\n\nThe Tirumala escarpment might have been formed by the structural\nactivity during the development of Tirupati valley upto Nagari nose. \n\n\n  Fluvial Landforms  \n\n \n\nThe rivers, \" Swarnamuki \" , \" Arani\n\" , and \" Ponnai \" , have developed conspicuous\nflood plains which are likely to be inundated during peak flood periods.\n\n\nThe plains relatively show low relief.\n\n\nA flood plain is usually built by later deposits with variations, and\nits drainage denotes that some of the rivers are structurally controlled.\n\n\nThe river \" Ponnai \" in Chittoor town flowing\nsouth-east seems to be controlled by a fault, lying parellel to the river\ncourse.\n\n\nThe river-built plains are utilised for cultivation of rice,\nsugarcane and banana.\n\n\nOld channels of river \" Arani \" could be traced on\n\" LANDSAT \" and due to the change of river courses, fluvial\nterraces could also be traced. \n\n\n  Alluvial Fans  \n\n \n\n\" Alluvial fans \" are more or less analogous to\ndeltas where a heavily loaded stream emerges from the mountain course to the\nlow-lying area.\n\n\nThere is a marked change in gradient resulting in deposition of\nalluvium apexing at the point of emergence and spreading out in fan-like form\non the low land.\n\n\nIn the study area two fans are identified in the upper course of\n\" Swarnamuki \" , the north-eastern part of the district.\n\n\n\n  Abandoned Channels  \n\n \n\nThe abandoned channels ( variously designated by diferent\nauthors as  ` ancient channels', ` buried channels', ` paleo-channels'\n etc., ) are identified by the aerial photographs based on the\nconspicuous low relief and sinuous trend, usually lying sub-parallel to the\nmain river courses.\n\n\nMost of them are low lying agricultural fields subjected to floods\nat different intervals.\n\n\nThe winding nature of these channels with a number of  `\ncut-offs'  indicates successive changes in the course of the rivers.\n\n\nIn the present study, a number of abandoned channels has been\nidentified in the \" Nagari \" and \" Araniar\n\" rivers. \n\n \n\nA special but interesting feature has been identified in the\npresent study.\n\n\nAlmost all the minor rivulets of \" Swarnamuki \"\noriginating in \" Tirupati hill ranges \" show a general\nsouth-east direction, making sudden easterly turn without joining \"\nSwarnamukihi \" .\n\n\nIt is said that all these streams were the tributaries in the\nbeginning, due to some sudden event in the geological history of the basin,\nthey changed their course affecting thereby  direction from south-east to north-east.\n\n\nA number of paleo-channels in its course further authenticated this\nview.  \n\n\n  Fluvio-Colluvial Landforms  \n\n\n  Creep Built Plains  \n\n \n\nThese are the deposits composed of unassorted material with\nangular gravel, pebbles and cobbles in a matrix of coarse sand and grit.\n\n\nThe creep-built plains are partly derived from the bordering hilly\nterrain and the piedmont colluvial plains by gravity, sheet wash and sheet\nflow.\n\n\nThe thickness of sediments in these plains also varies from 2 to 7 m\nand the slope ranges from 2 to 5 per cent.\n\n\nThe creep-built plains are very widely deposited on the eastern and\ncentral parts of the district. \n\n\n  Wash Plains  \n\n \n\nThese are stretches of plains next to creep-built plains and\npediments near to residual hills, with slope less than 2 per cent.\n\n\nThey are composed of mixed soils, namely, red sandy and silt soils,\nwhich might have formed partly due to over flowing of water over these plains\nduring peak flood periods along major river courses.\n\n\nOn the eastern part of the district some patches of black soil\nplains which have been derived from the situ biotite gneisses, may also be\nnoticed. \n\n\n  Pediment and Colluvial Plains  \n\n \n\nThese are cut rock surfaces with thin to thick veneer of debris.\n\n\nAccording to Mabbut ( 3), they are rarely composed of sub-alluvial\nsediments over the existing pediments possibly due to lateral deposition of\nsediments by fluvial action.\n\n\nThe pediments are distinctly noticed in an around \" Tirumala\nhills \" and \" Kuppam hills \" .\n\n\nThe main processes involved in the moulding of pediments are\n\" weathering \" , \" rainwash \" , \"\nsheetwash \" and \" sheet \" flow.\n\n\nThe low angle of pediment and low relative releif of residual\nremnants are presumed to be due to uniform lithology.\n\n\nIn a few pockets, granites and charnockites are left as remnants of\nresidual boulder indicating that the pediments here owe their origin more to\nlithological control than to differential erosion. \n\n\n  Conclusion  \n\n \n\nPhysiographically, the district may broadly be divided into 3\nzones viz., ( a) the western hilly region of more than 750 m elevation, ( b)\nthe central upland region which is undulating and dotted with ridges and\nclusters of rocky hills and hillocks of granitic origin, and ( c) the eastern\nplain region of narrow width with less than 50 m of elevation.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL",

{"text": "ROLE OF WOMEN IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT   \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION :  \n\n \n\nIn ancient India, women enjoyed a very high status in society,\nwhich is evident from the fact that many religious rituals were not regarded\nas complete unless they were present.\n\n\nWomen were also considered as a  \" Devi\"  .\n\n\nBut with the change in the social, political and economic pattern of\nthe country, a status of women witnessed a decline.\n\n\nThis situation continued for quite a long period until reformists like\n\" Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, Dayanand Saraswati,\nG. K. Gokhale Mahatma Jotiba Phule \" and \" D. K. Karve\n\" , started a social movement for the improvement of  conditions.\n\n\nLater on the leadership of the women was taken up by some eminent\nwomen as Kamala Devi Chattopadhya, Sarojini Naidu, Dr. Mathulaxmi Reddy and\nothers.\n\n\nThe movement for  emancipation gradually gained\nmomentum, and as a result the women of India were granted equality in all\nspheres of life alongwith men.\n\n\nThe Constitution of India declares,  \" The State shall not\ndiscriminate against any citizen on grounds of sex, religion, race, caste or\nplace of birth or any of these.\"  \n\n \n\nAlthough the Constitution grants equal status and rights to\neveryone without any discrimination of sex; women in most  cases cannot avail themselves of opportunities because of various\nfactors such as illiteracy and poverty, and social conventions.\n\n\nThe Census Reort, 1991 indicates that the female literacy ratio in\nthe country was 39.4 per cent in the total population.\n\n\nSimilarly, the number of women workers was 8.9  crores\n .\n\n\nRoughly speaking women form one-half of the total population ( 48 % )\ngiving 2 / 3 of the total working hours, produce 1 / 10 of the total\nproduction and they own only 1 / 100th of property in their names.\n\n\nTheir share in unemployment was slightly higher than men. \n\n \n\nThe employment opportunities for women are less because of social\nphysical and biological factors.\n\n\nFrom these facts it is evident that there is an urgent need for\ninitiating crash programmes for elevating the employment and status of women\nin the country. \n\n\n  RURAL WOMEN : THE NEGLECTED SECTOR :  \n\n \n\nAgriculture and allied fields provide the largest opportunities\nfor  employment.\n\n\nIt largely determines the rural  socio-economic\nstatus.\n\n\nThis is the sector where  role as unpaid labour in\nproductive activities is most prominent and is responsible for conferring\nwomen a non-working status.\n\n\nThe rural women are only regarded as the factors of production i.e.\nlabour.\n\n\nThe reason behind this is  that the women do\nnot have the land on their own account.\n\n\nOur land records do not show the rights of women in the landed\nproperty.\n\n\nOnly where a women is a widow, her name is figured in the record.\n\n\nTherefore, women cannot get credit facilities directly on their name;\nas a result of which women in rural    areas   are\n   unable   to establish  their own\neconomic image.\n\n\n   The   financial institutions generally\nhesitate to finance the women.\n\n\nThough women    have   equal rights in the\nfixed property of parents and husband yet there is lack of appreciation on\npart of the gents.\n\n\nThe position of tribal women is worst.\n\n\nThe women in such areas are helping the family in bringing the\nfire-wood and selling it in the market to meet their both ends meet.\n\n\nThis shows that the large section of the rural women is being\nexploited. \n\n\n  STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING THE STATUS OF WOMEN THROUGH\nCO-OPERATIVES  : \n\n \n\nThe most important means of achieving improvement in the status\nof women would be secure for them a    fair  \nshare of employment opportunities.\n\n\nAreas and sectors where women employment is either low or  they\nare  on the decline would be identified and co-operative measures be\ninitiated to promote additional avenues for employment.\n\n\nThe efforts would be made to offer employment for women in the\nco-operative activities like public distribution system, co-operative\ndairies, rural godowns, social forestry, etc.\n\n\nThe strict implementation of equal Remuneration Act, 1976, has  to be done.\n\n\nA major step to be taken to promote female employment \nwould be to expand and diversify the education and training opportunities\navailable to women.\n\n\nIn order to promote self-employment and small-scale industry\nemployment, the most crucial requirement is the allocation of commercial and\nco-operative bank credit. \n\n\n  PRESENT POSITION OF  CO-OPERATIVES IN INDIA\n:  \n\n \n\nThe co-operative movement was started in 1904 for providing\ncredit to farmers.\n\n\nSubsequently, the laws were amended to allow for the formation of\nother types of co-operative societies.\n\n\nAt present, the Indian co-operative movement in terms of size and\nmembership is one of the largest in the world.\n\n\nThe Co-operatives in India have made notable progress in the field of\nagricultural credit, marketing processing, etc.\n\n\nThe number of all types of co-operative exceeds 3.5  lakhs\n with a membership of 15.6  crores  .\n\n\nAt present there are 7,500 women co-operatives in the country.\n\n\nOut of them in Maharashtra, 1,372 are established and 1,027 women\nco-operatives are in working.\n\n\nThe participation and involvement of women in the co-operative\nmovement is not adequate and substantial. \n\n \n\nA majority of women's co-operative societies were thrift and\ncredit, \nencouraging the women to save and provide them credit on easy terms.\n\n\nNext to thrift societies, there were industrial  co-operatives such as  societies.\n\n\nThese co-operatives undertook activities such as tailoring, spinning,\n   embroidery   knitting,  durri\n - making, preparation of  papad  , pickles and jams.\n\n\nSome societies and sewing and    embroidery\n  classes.\n\n\nIn Maharashtra  co-operatives were engaged in\nhandcraft industries.\n\n\nThere were poultry, printing, cane work, and urban co-operative banks\nalso.\n\n\nIn    good   \nco-operatives were running a Canteen and in Madhya Pradesh some societies\nwere running libraries.\n\n\nThere are some examples of  co-operatives which are\nrunning nursery school and medical centres.\n\n\nThe women in rural area can undertake handicraft, horticulture,\nfloricutlure, poultry, bee-keeping, sericulture, seed bank, cultivation of\nmedicine plants, sheep keeping etc.\n\n\nSuch societies are of immense benefit to women as they get employment\nand render services to needy women. \n\n\n  RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND WOMEN CO-OPERATIVES  : \n\n \n\nCo-operative movement in India has achieved quantitative\nprogress, but it is lacking in qualitative development.\n\n\nThe number of co-operative seminars at the various    levels   during the last few years deliberated on    ways   and means to induce professional management in\nco-operation.\n\n\nAt the same time, it is also considered that due to lack of\nparticipation of women in co-operatives, the co-operatives are not running\nefficiently.\n\n\nTherefore, the Central and the State governments realised, the  inclusion of women members on the board of directors of\nco-operatives.\n\n\nThe Government of Maharashtra, as well as many other states have\namended their respective co-operative society Act and made provisions to give\n30 % representation to women members on the Board of Directors for all types\nof co-operative societies.\n\n\nAccordingly, in Maharashtra women members representation on the Board\nof Directors on the co-operative society has been determined from 1 to 3\nwomen members depending upon the total number of Board of Directors. \n\n\n  WOMEN AND BETTER LIVING ASPECTS IN AGRICULTURAL\nCO-OPERATIVES IN JAPAN  : \n\n \n\n Association of Agricultural Co-operatives (\nWAAC) of Japan has contributed a great deal to the development of\nagricultural and the development of rural house-holds.\n\n\nThe WAAC are carrying out the credit, marketing and purchasing\nactivities, they also help their members in insurance business also.\n\n\nThe WAAC covers the better living styles of rural women.\n\n\nThe styles of standard of living of rural women are almost equal to\nthe urban women in Japan.\n\n\nThese societies are helping their members in respect of keeping the\nhealthy environment and in safe living.\n\n\nThe WAAC have developed kitchen gardens in almost every       house.\n\n\nHealth care for family members is another important contribution of\nWAAC.\n\n\nThe WAAC is financially independent and has democratic management.\n\n\nIn short,  associations in Japan cover all aspects of\nhuman life and try to co-relate them with the agricultural co-operatives. <O>\n 7 <O>\n\n\n  RURAL  CO-OPERATIVES AND DEVELOPMENT : SOME\nEXAMPLES : Dairy and Women  : \n\n \n\nDairying is an important subsidiary occupation to reduce pressure\non crop production in rural areas.\n\n\nIt is more labour intensive than crop farming.\n\n\nDairying provides continuous employment to the farmers.\n\n\nThe point in favour of women in dairying is that the operations are\nnot as much strenous as in crops.\n\n\nThere is a greater degree of indoor activity.\n\n\nAs such there is scope for women to participate in the dairy.\n\n\n\" The Indian Institute of Public Opinion \" has\npointed out that the number of women engaged in dairy farming is increasing\nevery year.\n\n\nA number of dairy co-operatives have been set-up and run exclusively\nby the women in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.\n\n\nThe example of \" Priyadarshani \nCo-operative Dairy Society Ltd.  ,  \" .\n\n\nKagal can be highlighted.\n\n\nSix years back, the  `  organisation' \nat Kagal ( Dist. Kolhapur ) thought to organise the dairy co-operative\nsociety for women, and it is working sucessfully.\n\n\nThis is all women dairy co-operative.\n\n\nThe membership at this society was 176 and all the employees were\nalso women.\n\n\nThere are few more  dairy co-operatives in Kolhapur\ndistrict.\n\n\nThese societies are supplying the credit facilities to their members\nas well as they have undertaken the production of milk also.\n\n\nThe number of such societies is more in Balsad District ( Gujarat )\nand Chitoor District in Andhra Pradesh.\n\n\nIn field survey, it was <O>  8 <O> noticed that majority\nof the  milk co-operatives were formed whereever the milk\nco-operatives formed by    males went   into\nliquidation.\n\n\n  Credit Co-operatives and Women  : \n\n \n\nThe history of co-operative movement shows that there were  credit societies in old Punjab State, followed by Madras and\nBombay state.\n\n\nRecently, many states are having  co-operative credit\nsocieties including Maharashtra.\n\n\nMaharashtra is the number one State in respect of \ncredit societies as well as urban banks.\n\n\nMany of the credit societies are in rural areas.\n\n\nTo name one of them is \" Vitahalai Mahila Sahakari Pat\nSanstha Ltd. Kh. Tarale, Taluka Radhanagari, District Kolhapur. \"\n\n\n \n\nThis  co-operative credit society was formed by\nthe women, for the women and of the women.\n\n\nThis society is having 1,500 members working in its eight branches.\n\n\nIt has collected the deposits of Rs. 4  crores  .\n\n\nAs such this not a primary credit society, but functioning like a\nRural Bank.\n\n\nBesides, the loan activities, the society has undertaken social\nactivities such as medical check-up camps, students guidance, family welfare,\netc.\n\n\nThe work done by this society is appreciated by the television\nand many journalists.\n\n\nAs a result of the emergence of credit societies thousands of women\ncould undertake their self employment.\n\n\nThere are several other types <O>  9 <O> of  co-operative such as \" Savitri Sahakari Udhyog Sanstha\n\" at Warananagar, Ichalkaranji, Hupari ( Dist. Kolhapur ) and in\nSangli, Satara districts also. \n\n\n  CONSTRAINTS IN DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL WOMEN  : \n\n \n\nSome problems and constraints experienced in managing rural\nwomen co-operatives are listed below :\n\n\n1.  Iliteracy and Ignorance  :\n\n\nLower rate of female literacy is one of the improtant factors, which\nprevents women involvement in the rural co-opera-tives.\n\n\nThe illiterate and semi-literate women feel shy to join the\nco-operatives, as they have no clear understanding about the concept and\nmanagement of co-operatives.\n\n\n2.  Financial constraints  :\n\n\nAlthough there are various financial agencies for providing finance\nto co-operatives, yet complex official procedure of these agencies creates\nbarrier for women to undertake co-operative activities.\n\n\n3.  Limitations in Co-operative Laws  :\n\n\nThe Co-operative Acts, Rules and By-laws prevent women to join\nco-operatives, for example, in village level  . \n\n\n   Multiple   co-operative societies\nthe membership is open to those who have  in their\nname.\n\n\nGenerally women do not possess land, as a result of which they fail\nto become members of the society.\n\n\n4.  Political Hinderance  :\n\n\nThe major problem is political  <-> hinderance </- > \nhindrance   by male political leaders, in view of the fact, that the\nwomen Presidents of the societies play a role in election of the higher level\nof federation.\n\n\nThis affects the progress of women co-operatives.\n\n\n5.  Lack of Policy Decision  :\n\n\nThere is no policy formulated by the movement for the promotion of\nrural  co-operatives, except the efforts made by Government\nof Maharashtra.\n\n\nRecently, the Maharashtra Government has formulated the policy to\nform  multipurpose service co-operative society at village\nlevel.\n\n\nOf course, the viability of such societies is doubtful. \n\n\n  CONCLUSIONS  : \n\n \n\nAlthough the constitution of India, grants equal status and\nright, to everyone, without any discrimination of sex, women, in most cases\ncannot avail themselves of opportunities, because of various factors such as\nilliteracy and poverty and social    conventions.\n \n\n\nThe foregoing discussion shows that the status of rural women is \n  worse   than the urban women,  though their work participation is equal to the gents.\n\n\nThe issue of rural women development has been discussed and it seems\nthat due to the formation of rural  co-operatives the status\nas well the socio-economic conditions of women can be improved.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "553f1136-b730-4af8-bd5c-17474cf84595", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.116169+00:00"}
{"text": "SPECIAL REPORT \n\n\n Travails of  houseless citizens        \n\n\n By <@AS> Rajesh Singh {#} \n\n \n\nFACT I: It is estimated that more than 60% of houses in the port\ntown of Vasco da Gama are illegal.\n\n\nThat they are constructed on encroached land.\n\n\nThat most of them belong to lower middle class income or economically\nweaker sections of the population.\n\n\nThat such constructions lead to ( and have led to) the sprouting of\nslums and shanties with far reaching ominous consequences manifested in\ndeteriorating law and order situation etc.\n\n\nThat all this is because of the unavailability of reasonably priced\nland and finance to the lower income group of people. \n\n \n\nFACT II: Goa is on the fast-lane of urban development.\n\n\nPrivate real estate agents, constructors, brokers have never had\nit so good.\n\n\nMulti-floored constructions are cropping up in every available\nopen space.\n\n\nBig names like  too have made their debut in the\nState.\n\n\nAs a result, land prices have shot up to the extent that only the\naffluent can afford them.\n\n\nThe National Commission on Urbanisation, a few years ago had in\nits report, noted that Goa was developing too rapidly for the basic\ninfrastructure to keep pace. \n\n \n\nThe contrast is telling.\n\n\nIt may not have reached alarming proportions yet, but the trends are\nclear enough to make any Government sit up with concern.\n\n\nGoa is on the threshold of industrial development.\n\n\nMore and more industrial houses are showing interest in coming\nto the State.\n\n\nThis means continued flow of migrant labour.\n\n\nAs it is, the Mormugao Port Trust and the Dock Labour Board are (\nand probably will continue to be) major employers of migrant labour.\n\n\nWhere are these migrant citizens going to live? \n\n \n\nIt does not, of course, mean that the housing crisis that Goa\ncould face in the coming years would solely be due to the inflow of such\nlabour.\n\n\nBut like in Bombay, it can be a major cause.\n\n\nIt is also pertinent to mention here that almost 100% of such\nlabour comprises unskilled workers who, not being financially well off,\nwould be the residents of slums and shanties. \n\n \n\nThe State Government has had ample time to study the problem and\nformulate a housing policy.\n\n\nHowever, it has not done anything concrete so far.\n\n\nA few half-hearted attempts have been made but they lacked in\nexecution and produced negligible results.\n\n\nThere has been no serious move to coordinate the functioning of\nagencies such as the Goa Housing Board,  communidades  ,\ninstitutions providing housing finance such as the LIC, Housing Urban\nDevelopment Corporation and Cooperative banks in an attempt to formulate a\nlong term pragmatic policy. \n\n \n\nNothing can better illustrate the  apathy\nto the issue than the state of affairs in the Goa Housing Board since its\ninception in 1967.\n\n\nEstablished with the hallowed aim of providing quality low cost\nhouses to the economically weaker sections and lower middle income group of\npeople, the GHB was virtually non existent till Dr. M. Modassir took over\nsome two years ago.\n\n\nIt constructed a miserable total of 1492 houses for the economically\nweaker sections; 614 houses for the low income group; 526 houses for the\nmiddle income groups and developed only 1438 plots.\n\n\nIt showed even lesser interest in fully utilising the paltry\ngrants received from the State Government ( incidentally given more of\ncompulsion than with a view to see the GHB flourish). \n\n \n\nFor instance, out of the Rs. 1.10  crore \nsanctioned by the State for the year 1988-89, the Board could utilize only 50\n lakhs  ; the balance amount of Rs. 60  lakhs \nthus lapsed!\n\n\nThis is astonishing considering the scarcity of funds for\nconstruction purposes and the urgent need for low cost housing.\n\n\nThe Government did not bother much about the complacency of the\npremier housing institution, either. \n\n \n\nToday, Dr. Modassir seems confident of tackling the problem.\n\n\nWhile acknowledging that the Board had not lived up to its role, he\nemphasised that since his takeover two years ago, things have turned for the\nbetter.\n\n\n \" Our major problem is funds.\n\n\nSo, apart from the government, we are approaching agencies such as\nHUDCO, GIC, Canfin etc,\"  he informed. \n\n \n\nOut of the Rs. 125  lakhs  sanctioned by the\nGovernment for the year 1989-90 the GHB showed remarkable alacrity and\ndrew as much as Rs. 75  lakhs  by July 1989.\n\n\nIt approached the Housing Development Finance Corporation and\nextracted a commitment from them for advancing Rs. 2.60  crore\n .\n\n\nA proposal has already been submitted to them. \n\n \n\nThe Goa Housing Board has also approached the newly constituted\nNational Housing Bank for a loan of Rs. 4.23  crore  , the\nbiggest ever asked by the Board so far.\n\n\n \" We intend to fully utilize the funds and make our presence\nfelt,\"  Dr. Modassir stated confidently.\n\n\nIn addition, the Board also proposes to approach Canfin, the\nhousing-finance department of Canara Bank for a loan of Rs. 1.23 \ncrore  . \n\n \n\nBut, will this sudden burst of enthusiasm be optimally utilized\nby the Board, which at best, has remained non-functional? Dr. Modassir said\nthat the Board would soon be reconstituted and senior appointments made to\nrevitalize its functioning. \n\n \n\nThe GHB also proposes to get into the construction of houses for\nthe upper-middle income group because  \" they are the ones who will\noffset our subsidies extended to the other sections,\"  said Dr.\nModassir. \n\n\n Continued on page 3 \n\n\n Continued from page 2. \n\n \n\nThe list of current activities of the Board and what it\nproposes to do in the near future, is long.\n\n\nThat it will not be able to meet all the targets, is almost\ncertain.\n\n\nOne major constraint that the GHB faces in speedy implementation of\nits schemes is the unavailability of reasonably priced land.\n\n\nThis, incidentally, is a problem faced by other housing agencies\nas well.\n\n\nThe Board cannot buy land without government sanction.\n\n\nAnd, if it wishes to purchase land in the open market, it has to pay\nthrough its nose.\n\n\nApart from    government   land, the\nonly avenue to acquire cheap land is the  Communidades  .\n\n\nBut, the Code of  Communidades  , which came into\neffect on 15.4.1961 through a Diploma Legislative No: 2070, has set down\nstringent conditions for selling  communidades  land.\n\n\n \n\n Communidade  land cannot be sold to\nprivate parties or individuals except by auction.\n\n\nThis rule is waived off in case of cooperative societies or\nlandless persons.\n\n\nHowever, if an individual wishing to construct a house wants to buy\nland from the  communidade  , the sale is never  \"\nout right\"  .\n\n\nThe  communidades  gives him land on a lease of 20\nyears and only after he pays off the amount during the period, does he get\nthe sale-deed for the land.\n\n\nThe result is that he cannot avail loan from either the bank or any\nother financing institution for construction of the house because he\ncannot produce the sale-deed of the land which is to act as security. \n<call-out>\n\n\n If housing in Goa is miserable, the affairs of the Goa Housing\nBoard have been no less so.\n\n\nJust one example is enough: out of the Rs. 1.10  crore\n sanctioned to it by the State Government for 1988-89, the Board\ncould utilise only Rs. 50  lakh  , leaving Rs. 60  lakh\n to lapse.\n\n\nWhen, therefore, it is announced that the housing sector in the State\nwill be given a boost in the next two years through a variety of schemes\nunder the Housing Board involving an investment of Rs. 12  crore\n , one doesn't know whether to feel elated or to laugh.\n\n\nWe are told by the  chairman, Vasu Paik Gaonkar, that\nthe current term of the people who run the Housing Board has almost come\nto an end occasioning a reconstitution.\n\n\nWe feel like keeping our fingers crossed.  </call-out>\n\n \n\n Communidade  rules do not stop at that.\n\n\nIf a person fails to cover 1/5th of the land he has leased from the\n communidade  by construction within four years of\ntaking possession, the land reverts back to the  communidade\n along with any partial construction done.\n\n\nIn other words, for four years, the possession is only provisional.\n\n\n \n\nOf course, the person if he so wishes, can pay 20 years of the\nlease rent in advance.\n\n\nThe question is: if he had that kind of money to spend at a go and\nfurther invest in construction of the house, why would he approach \ncommunidades  with all this cumbersome procedures?\n\n\nHe could go to a private real estate developer! \n\n \n\nRecognizing the vast scope in the housing section in a\ndeveloping state like Goa, several housing finance agencies have begun\nshowing interest in the State, HUDCO, HDFC, LIC and Canara \nCanfin, are among the many.\n\n\nThey do not seem to have made much of an impact, though.\n\n\nOne common refrain from all has been the  lack\nof response to their schemes.\n\n\nBut the  development commissioner, Mr R.S. Sethi\ndoes not agree.\n\n\n \" Let them give viable proposals.\n\n\nWe will consider.\n\n\nThey should not talk in the air,\"  he commented. \n\n \n\nThe senior Divisional Manager of Life Insurance Corporation, Mr.\nK.K.\n\n\nKrishnan, sees a big role for the housing finance schemes of the LIC\nin revitalizing the housing sector in the state  \" provided the\ngovernment cooperates\"  .\n\n\nMr. Krishnan finds the lack of availability of reasonably priced\nland as the main constraint.\n\n\nSenior LIC officers also expressed dissatisfaction at the  attitude to their policy-linked housing finance schemes.\n\n\nThe LIC had forwarded a proposal to the government to undertake\nthe construction of a housing colony for those policy holders who\nsatisfied their terms and condition to qualify for an LIC loan.\n\n\nThe proposal required the Government to provide the LIC with\nreasonably-priced land.\n\n\n( It pointed out that the LIC had constructed a similar colony in\nBangalore, Ahmedabad and some other cities.\n\n\nBut the proposal was turned down by the government which asked for\nsurvey details as to how many policy holders were actually willing to\navail of the housing finance.\n\n\n \" This is ridiculous.\n\n\nWe have one  lakh  policy holders.\n\n\nHow can we survey all of them!\"  an LIC officer muttered.\n\n\n \n\nAn attempt was made at the housing seminar held in Panjim in May\nlast year to highlight the problems faced by housing development\nauthorities, both in the private and public sector and, broadly, eleven\nsuggestions were made to sort them out.\n\n\nThere was near unanimity on the need to simplify procedures and\nintroduce a  \" single window system\"  for the clearance of all\nformalities relating to the housing sector. \n\n \n\nNon-availability of land at reasonable rates was another\nimportant issue raised in the seminar.\n\n\nThe Goa branch of the Builders Association of India suggested that\nif the Government could provide land at reasonable rates, houses with a\nbuilt-up area of about 40 sq.mts could be constructed for only Rs. 55,000\nplus cost of the land.\n\n\nThe Association expressed its willingness to provide the necessary\ntechnical help and guidance to any agency executing the work. \n<call-out>\n\n\n A survey indicates that there will be a shortage of 1,40,000\nhouses in Goa by the turn of the century.\n\n\nIt remains to be seen how the government reacts to this reality.\n </call-out>\n\n \n\nSuggestions have come in plenty, but the \nresponse so far has been guarded.\n\n\nA survey indicates that there will be a shortage of 1,40,000 houses\nin Goa by the turn of the century.\n\n\nIt remains to be seen how the government reacts to this reality.\n<box>\n\n \n\n Development Commissioner, Mr R.S. Sethi, is an\nacknowledged expert on the housing sector.\n\n\nHe has presented two very authoritative papers - - one titled\n 'On Some Aspects of Housing in Europe'  , in 1986 and the\nother,  'Housing in Bangkok Metropolitan Area and Surroundings in\n1987'  .\n\n\nMr. Sethi does not consider the present housing scenario in Goa\nalarming, adding however, that a lot could be done.\n\n\nExcerpts from an interview he gave to GOA POST: \n\n\n ON THE VARIOUS SCHEMES OF INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS LIC, CANFIN, ETC\n: \n\n \n\nThey have approached us.\n\n\nBut the proposals are not concrete.\n\n\nIn the LIC case, since they want to construct a housing colony for\ntheir policy-holders, we have asked them to purchase land from the open\nmarket.\n\n\nWhy should we give them land at cheaper rates for the benefit of a\nfew of their policy holders!\n\n\nIn any case, we had earlier asked them to conduct a survey and find\nout if their scheme would draw adequate response from their policy holders.\n\n\nThey should not talk in the air. \n\n\n ON THE HOUSING POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT \n\n \n\nThe government is responsive to the demands of the housing\nsector.\n\n\nLand should be acquired in a locality where there is demand for\nhouses.\n\n\nThere is no point in constructing houses where there is no demand\nand there is also lack of basic amenities such as electricity, water etc.\n\n\n \n\nWe would prefer to build self-contained housing colonies with\nschool, shopping, facilities, hospital etc. \n\n \n\nWe are willing to invest in viable housing schemes but they must\nbe linked with specific programmes.\n\n\nThe Planning Commission has approved a sum of Rs. 1.40  crore\n for the year 1990-91 for the housing sector. \n\n\n ON THE FUNCTIONING OF GOA HOUSING BOARD \n\n \n\nThe activities of the GHB have been sluggish.\n\n\nOnly recently have they begun working in earnest.\n\n\nWhile it continues to provide low-cost housing to the economically\nweaker sections, they should auction plots and use the amount for\ncross-subsidising their other activities. \n\n\n ON RISING NUMBER OF ILLEGAL CONSTRUCTIONS \n\n \n\nWhile laws have to be strictly enforced to prevent illegal\nconstructions, a cut-off date will have to be decided for those already\nexisting for the purpose of    regularisation\n  .\n\n\nIn Delhi, for instance, all illegal constructions which came up\nprior to 1980 were regularised; others were deemed illegal.  </box>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f93100ed-822f-4fca-93ba-d1ec515be530", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.117320+00:00"}
{"text": "Solid Wastes : Sources, Implications and Management \n \n\n\nGopal Dayal\n\n\n Tata Chemicals Ltd., ( Fertilizer Division ) , Post Bag No. \n1,  Indira Dham, Babrala  - 202 521,  Badaun \n\n \n\n With the influx of industrial revolution coupled with ever\nescalating urbanisation, increasing consumerism and population exodus, the\nproblem of solid wastes has inflated significantly.\n\n\nThe paper throws light on various sources of solid wastes and their\nimplications on health, environment and economy.\n\n\nBesides it also envisages merits and demerits of various solid waste\ndisposal techniques in the light of the recent literature.\n\n\nThe paper concludes with the recommendations and suggestions for a\nbetter menagement of solid wastes.    \n\n \n\nEnvironment is the sum total of all conditions and influences that\naffect development and life of organisms ( odum, 1977 ) .\n\n\nThe environment consists of 4 major components : \" Lithosphere\n\" ( the outer mantle of solid earth, that is  crust\nincluding soil ) , \" atmosphere \" ( the protective blanket\nof gases surrounding the earth ) , \" hydrosphere \" ( all\ntypes of water sources, such as oceans, lakes, ponds, rivers, etc. ) and\n\" biosphere \" ( the realm of living organisms and their\ninteractions with environment ) .\n\n\nAll living species of plants and animals influence their\nenvironment and vice versa.\n\n\nThe extent of such impact is not high in these species.\n\n\nThe reason are many; may it be their balanced population due to\nnormal checks or their inability to modify the environment.\n\n\nHowever, man interacts exceptionally with nature and can modify the\nenvironment in a variety of ways according to his requirements, knowledge\nand values.\n\n\nEver increasing urbanization, surging population, ramifying\nindustries, the green revolution and their aftermath have culminated into an\naltogether different type of problem termed as the environmental\npollution.\n\n\nPollution may be described in several ways, for example \"\nwater pollution \" , \" air pollution \" , \"\nheat or thermal pollution \" , \" agricultural pollution\n\" , \" noise pollution \" , \" solid waste\npollution \" , etc., which may be natural or man-made, local,\nnational, international or even planetary engulfing the entire\nbiosphere.\n\n\nIn the present article pollution from solid waste alongwith the\ndifferent aspects of its management are discussed. \n\n\n  SOLID WASTE POLLUTION  \n\n \n\nMan has been producing the solid wastes during the course of his\nnormal activities since the beginning of life.\n\n\nAt the very minimum these comprise \" food wastes \" ,\n\" ashes \" , \" broken utensils \" , \"\nrags \" , etc.\n\n\nIn a small agricultural community nature who has nested and nurtured\nus since the time immemorial, readily accepts these wastes into her\nnatural cycle : animals consume food remains, vegetables, etc., and other\nmaterials are rapidly incorporated into the soil.\n\n\nDuring early periods, solid wastes were conveniently and\nunobtrusively disposed off as the density of population was low with large\nopen land space.\n\n\nWith the advent of industrialization and urbanization, the problems\nof waste disposal increased.\n\n\nThe term \" waste \" implies that it is of no\nconcern and is of no use to anyone.\n\n\nIt is a problem precisely because it is a material that is not wanted\nby the producers or consumers who, of course, seek to dispose off it at the\nlowest possible cost.\n\n\n\" Solid waste \" can be defined as any unwanted\nmaterial, that is not discharged to the atmosphere or via a pipe.\n\n\nIt is a term now used internationally to describe \"\nnon-liquid wastes from domestic, trade, commercial, industrial,\nagricultural \" , and from the \" public services\n\" . \n\n\n  SOURCES, CHARACTERISTICS AND CLASSIFICATION OF\n\" SOLID WASTES \"  \n\n \n\n\" Solid wastes \" come from a wide variety of\nsources and different types are the responsibilities of different\nagencies.\n\n\nThese comprise countless different materials : \" Dust\n\" , \" food wastes \" , \" packing in the form\nof paper \" , \" metals \" , \" glass\n\" , \" wornout clothings \" and \"\nfurnitures \" , \" garden wastes \" formed due to\n\" construction \" and \" demolition processes\n\" , \" dead bodies of animals and plants \" ,\n\" pathological wastes \" , \" hazardous wastes\n\" , \" radioactive wastes \" ( also known as royal\nwastes ) and \" agricultural wastes \" .\n\n\nA flow diagram of the materials and solid waste generation in our\ntechnological society is presented in figure 1 ( Tchobanoglous     et al., \n1977 ) .\n\n\nRefuse characteristics have been known to vary depending upon the\ndegree of industrialization, standary of living and  \n dietary   habits of the community.\n\n\nInternational variations are caused by a variety of factors,\nincluding wealth, literacy and work habits.\n\n\nThe differences are often very great.\n\n\nResidents of large towns seem to throw away more than people in small\ntowns.\n\n\nThe general rule is that as one goes from a small, poor, traditional\nand illiterate community to a large, rich, moderate and literate one,\nthe refuse weight increases the density decreases ( and, therefore, the\nvolume increases ) , the \" food preparation waste \" also\nreduces, the \" paper and packing fraction \" increases and\naverage particle   size increases.\n\n\nHowever, these trends do not always hold true ( Coad, 1973 ) .\n\n\nA knowledge of physicochemical characteristics in imperative for\nthe selection of proper disposal methods.\n\n\nSome important characteristics of the \" solid wastes\n\" are given in table \n\n\n1. A typical classification of solid wastes has been given by Rogus (\n1964) :\n\n\nGarbage - - \" Putrescible ( decomposable ) wastes \"\nfrom \" food \" , \" slaughterhouse \" ,\n\" canning and freezing industries \" , and other sources.\n\n\n2. \" Rubbish - - Nonputrescible wastes \" , either\ncombustible or noncombustible.\n\n\n\" Combustible wastes \" include \" paper\n\" , \" wood \" , \" cloth \" ,\n\" rubber \" , \" leather \" , and \"\ngarden wastes \" .\n\n\n\" Noncombustibles \" include \" metals\n\" , \" glass \" , \" ceramics \" ,\n\" stones \" , \" dirt \" , \" masonry\n\" , and \" some chemicals \" .\n\n\n3. Ashes - - \" Residues \" ( such as cinders and\nflyash ) of the combustion of solid fuels for heating and cooking or the\nincineration of solid wastes by municipal, industrial, and apartment hosue\nincinerators.\n\n\n4. Large wastes - - \" Demolition and construction rubble\n\" ( pipes, lumber, masonry, brick, plastic, roofing and insulating\nmaterials ) , \" automobiles \" , \" furniture\n\" , \" refrigerators \" and other home appliances,\n\" trees \" , \" tires \" , and other iterms.\n\n\n5. Dead animals - - \" Household pets \" , \"\nbirds \" , \" rodents \" , \" zoo animals\n\" and others.\n\n\nThere are also \" anatomical and pathological wastes\n\" from hospitals.  \n\n\n\n6. \" Sewage treatment process solids \" - - \"\nScreenings \" , \" settled solids \" , \"\nsludge \" .\n\n\n7. \" Industrial solid wastes \" - - \"\nChemicals \" , \" paints \" , \" sand\n\" , \" explosives \" .\n\n\n8. \" Mining wastes \" - - \"  `\nTailings'  \" , \" slag heaps \" , \"\nculm piles \" at coal mines.\n\n\n9. \" Agricultural wastes \" - - \" Farm animal\nmanure \" , \" crop residues \" , and others.\n\n\n  ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF SOLID WASTES  \n\n \n\nThe most obvious environmental damage caused by \" solid\nwastes \" is aesthetics :\n\n\nThe ugliness of street litter and the destruction of the beauty of\ncountryside by improper dumping of city wastes.\n\n\nHowever, the crux of solid waste problem which often goes unheeded\nlines in the leachates.\n\n\nThe \" leachate \" is the liquid that has travelled\nsolid wastes or other medium and has extracted, dissolved or suspended\nmaterial from it ( ISI, 1981 ) .\n\n\nThe \" leachates \" are known to infiltrate through\nthe layers of soil beneath and contaminate the groundwater sources deep\ndown to infiltrate through the layers of soil beneath and contaminate the\ngroundwater sources deep down ( Heghes  et al.,  1971; Dayal \net al.,  1991 ) as depicted in figure 2.\n\n\nThe leachates from dumping sites or disposal tanks of sewage mixed\nindustrial effluents and wastes are more harmful as they contain organic\ncompounds, like carcinogenic hydrocarbons, benzene, toluene, etc., and\nchlorinated hydrocarbons all of which are highly poisoneous.\n\n\nRun off from dump-site may deteriorate surface water quality as\nillustrated in figure 3 ( Horvath, 1984; Borden and Yanoschak, 1990 ) .\n\n\nAir pollution may also be caused from the inefficient burning of\nwastes, either in the open air or in plants that lack effective\ntreatment facilities for the gaseous effluents ( Berlincioni and Di Domenico,\n1986 ) . \n\n\n  HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF SOLID WASTES  \n\n \n\nThere are potential risks to health from wastes.\n\n\nThey   \ncan cause public health problems indirectly by encouraging the growth of\npopulation of flies ( which can transmit fever, cholera, dysentry,\ntuberculosis, anthrax, etc. ) , rats ( which can spread plague, murine\ntyphus fever, leptospirosis, rabies, rickettsiaplox, etc. ) , cockroaches,\nmosquitoes ( which can cause malaria, yellow fever, dengue, mosquito - -\nborne encephalitis, filariasis, etc. ) , and other pests.\n\n\nWorkers involved in collection and disposal of solid wastes are\ndirectly subjected to health hazards.\n\n\nA study in India found a higher incidences of intestinal parasites\nin collectars of domestic wastes than in the population as a whole (\nArceivala, 1971 ) , glass, jagged metal and razor blades cause cuts\nwhich may become infected or lead to tetanus.\n\n\nThey are also prone to sprains and back disorders because of heavy\nlifting their job requires.\n\n\nTraffic accidents are another hazard because of the frequent need\nto cross the road ( NSC, 1971 ) .\n\n\nRespiratory disease is a possible consequence of inhaling dust\nfrom refuse and street sweeping, especially where spitting is common. \n\n\n  GENERATION OF SOLID WASTES  \n\n \n\nAs everyday passed the garbage in the street corner bin spilled\nover sooner that it could be emptied.\n\n\nFor instance, in USA each sun sets sees a new mountain to be\nprecise 4,10,000 tonne of solid wastes.\n\n\nNew York itself throws out 25,000 tonne of solid stink when none of\nthe  14 landfills in use for more than 25 year, can take any\nmore.\n\n\nThe amount of solid wastes produced in Canada during 1970 would be\nsufficient to build a 4 lane highway raised three feet above ground level\nstretching from Toranto to Vancouver.\n\n\nIn our town backyard, Delhi city collects about 3,000 tonne of\ngarbage from its streets everyday, to be thrown into its 5 landfills.\n\n\nThe people of Kanpur city everyday discharge 1800 m3 ( 900\ntonne) of solid wastes and 1700 m3 of night soil.\n\n\nIn India, the per capita production of solid wastes is about 0.35\nkg / day in urban settlements and about 0.20 kg / day in rural areas.\n\n\nOn the contrary, U.S. population discards 2.50 kg / day / head of\nsolid wastes, Canada 1.64 day / head and U.K. 1.0 kg / day / head.\n\n\nIn some other countries the solid waste production rates are given in\ntable 2.\n\n\nIncreased commercial and industrial activities have, however,\nresulted into an increased release of wastes are known to increase per capita\nwaste generation as well.\n\n\nIt is repoted that an increase of 1.5 % per  annum occurs in U.S.A.\n\n\n( Tchobanoglous  et al.,  1977) .\n\n\nNagur based CPHERI ( now known as NEE RI ) observations during\n1969-70 in Calcutta showed a per capita increase of 1.33 % per year ( N\nEERI, 1973 ) .\n\n\nIn developing countries, like Hongkong, the per capita generation\nrate was 0.73 kg / day which was expercted to go upto 1.33 kg / head / day in\n1986 indicating an increase of 6.08 % / per year. \n\n\n  ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF SOLID WASTES  \n\n \n\nMunicipal agencies spend 20 to 40 % of their annual budget on\nsolid waste management in the developing countries ( Cointreau, 1982 ) and\non average 10 % in India ( NEERI, 1973 ) .\n\n\nLabour and transport absorb 65 % of the operating costs of solid\nwaste management programmes.\n\n\nIt is common for a city to employ between 2 and 5 workers for each\n1000 population.\n\n\nThree workers 1000 population may represent 1 % of the total\nnational work force.\n\n\nTransport is required on a scale of about 1 heavy vehicle / 15,000\npopulation.\n\n\nThus solid waste management schemes can absorb upto 1 % of the gross\nnational product ( GNP ) . \n\n\n  SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT  \n\n \n\nSolid waste management may be defined as that discipline\nassociated with the control of generation, storage, collection, transfer and\ntransport, process ing, and disposal of solid waste in the proper manner,\nthat is in accordance with the suitable measures for general sanitation,\neconomics, engineering, conservation, aesthetics, and other environmental\nconsiderations, as well as responsible to public attitude.\n\n\nIn the management, the collection and transport are the important\nfactors.\n\n\nThe collection work should be carried out under the supervision of\nproperly trained staff to obtain the desired results.\n\n\nThe success of any collection system depends mainly on the proper\nselection of the collecting equipments.\n\n\nTo develop the proper collection system the following factors must\nbe considered : ( 1)\n\n\nPopulation and area of the solid waste collection, ( 2)\n\n\nTopography or configuration of collection area, ( 3)\n\n\nClimatic factors, such as rain fall, wind speed, temperature;\nand height from the sea level, etc., ( 4)\n\n\nCharacteristics and qualities of waste product of collecting\narea, ( 5)\n\n\nTypes of collecting equipments and availability of modern\nequipments, ( 6)\n\n\nRate of collection by the staff members and ( 7)\n\n\nImplementation of rules and regulations. \n\n\n  CURRENT PRACTICES OF SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL  \n\n \n\nOne of the easiest ways to get rid of \" solid wastes\n\" is to dump them simply in a land untitled and inhabitated.\n\n\nHowever, dwindling land resources have checked this tendency.\n\n\nFor proper disposal of these wastes, scientists have evolved various\nmethods, like incineration, composting, etc.\n\n\nHowever, no single menagement option can serve as a panacea for\nour waste problems.\n\n\nHence, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency encourages\nmunicipalities to use a mix of solutions to handle solid wastes.\n\n\n( EPA, 19 89a, 1989b ) .\n\n\nWithin the range of management options, \" EPA \"\nsuggests a hierarchy for decision makers to consider when planning and\nimplementing integrated solid waste management.\n\n\nThe first level of hierarchy is source reduction.\n\n\nRecycling, including the composting, is the second level of\nhierarchy.\n\n\nFinally in  hierarchy comes waste\ncombustion ( incineration ) and landfilling.\n\n\nLandfilling is the only true disposal method.\n\n\nIt is a necessary component of waste management since all\nmanagement options produce some residue that must be disposed off\nthrough landfilling.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d8f08fb6-1720-4505-9bd4-8da2c3f15a0d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.118706+00:00"}

it is the provision of opportunity to enhance and\nexploit that talent.\n\n\nLondon examiners have found great potential in the pupils they test\nhere, she points out, but Bombay has no academy of music to offer its young\nprodigies a chance to explore their genius.\n\n\nIn countries like Korea and Japan, she tells us, there is a constant\ninflux of the best French and Russian teachers coming in to teach at the\nmusic schools, and their students go on to teach another generation - -\nensuring that talent is constantly fostered and encouraged.\n\n\nIn Bombay, the BCO, handicapped by a lack of funds, can only invite\nforeign teachers for a period of four weeks a year, through the sponsorship\nof the British Council and the Max Mueller Bhavan.\n\n\nThe students of the brass and wind section are further hampered by\nthe total absence of local teachers and must only rely on these workshops,\nand then on Arnavaz and  encouragement to keep them going.\n\n\n \" We need an academy of music here desperately,\" \nJini says,  \" Because our talent is going largely untapped.\n\n\nNowhere in the world have students ably played in a symphonic\norchestra after just two years, but there is nothing here to give them the\nincentive to make music anything but an extracurricular activity.\" \n\n\n \n\nIn the face of such difficulty and at a time when youth\neverywhere is tripping on MTV and its Channel V  avatar  ,\nwhat draws these young people to the relative unfamiliar field of western\nclassical music?\n\n\n \" It is the influence of their parents that is so important,\"\n stresses Jini.\n\n\n \" Like a child who, untutored, and born with no language\nskills, will still learn to understand and put together new words, so will a\nchild who is exposed to western classical music within the family learn to\nappreciate it.\" \n\n\nAnd most of the musicians do come from musical backgrounds.\n\n\nNot only did  mother encourage her to take up\nplaying at 14, she also kept her at her music, when the going got tough.\n\n\n father, whose medical studies put an end to his\nmusic, actively supports his son through the demands of his calling.\n\n\nKenneth  sister, herself a student then, had him\nsitting on the piano stool, at the age of four and both Noel  father and grandfather played the violin.\n\n\nNo doubt, it helps when the rest of the family, whose members have\ngone through the same nerve-jangling routine, can tell you that that\ncacophony erupting from your violin, too, will pass. \n\n \n\nAnother motivating factor could be the relatively early age at\nwhich the bugle bug bit.\n\n\nAlthough Jini reveals that she only started playing at the age of 18\nfor want of opportunity earlier, she also admits that starting early means a\nphysical flexibility that is tremendously advantageous - - and absolutely\nnecessary if one is serious about music.\n\n\nVery young arms will find it much easier to hold a violin than older\nones - -  very akin to a young  body adapting\nto the contortions required.\n\n\nAnd as Marlisa will tell you,  \" When you start playing at\nfive or six, it is in the tension-free world of childhood; and your mind can\nabsorb better.\"  \n\n \n\nGood musicians nurture their art with practice and more practice,\nwhich is difficult to find time for, especially in the fast pace of Bombay.\n\n\nMarlisa admits that she finds even her mandatory 45 minutes\nexhausting after a hard day of secreterial work.\n\n\nBut most of the violinists do put aside at least an hour everyday.\n\n\nAshwin loses himself in his violin for hours on end at times and\nKenneth puts in at least an hour on the piano each day. \n\n \n\nCredit for the development of western classical talent in Bombay,\nespecially when the  own interest in music could easily be\ndiscouraged and thwarted, goes to the benevolent umbrella of the BCO.\n\n\nFor a ridiculously low membership fee of Rs 15 a year, students can\nplay on instruments ( loaned by the British Council and Max Mueller Bhavan\nsince the Indian government prohibits the import of instruemnts) which would\notherwise be out of their financial reach, avail of free coaching and have\nthe chance to play in concerts.\n\n\nJoining at ages as young as nine, they get a chance to hear other\ninstruments, and choose one that they would like to take up, to feel first\nhand what making music is all about.\n\n\nThe students are usually Myra  students and  pupils - - some of whom come to her at the age of three and a\nhalf and whom she exposes to the beauty of western classical music through\nthe medium of play.\n\n\nWhen they join the orchestra for their Sunday practices, they must\nsit out at least one concert, because the tension of letting an entire\nsection down is a risk too great to take.\n\n\nAnd they may have to wait longer till Jini or Ernavaz decide they are\nready.\n\n\nBut clearly it is an experience worth waiting for.\n\n\nFor many of the musicians, being part of the orchestra is a dream\ncome true.\n\n\n \" Learning alone doesn't teach you co-ordination; it is only\nwith others that you really make music,\"  enthuses Christina.\n\n\n \" As you spend more time in the orchestra, taking on the\nincreasing responsibility of playing more precise notes in a shorter amount\nof time, your sense of responsibility, your maturity, also heightens,\"\n says Kenneth, who joined the BCO accidentally.\n\n\n \" My friend, Joseph Gomes, whyo is with the orchestra, asked\nme whether I wanted to fill in the vacant slot of a double bassist, and I\nwent, imagining that I would be playing the cello.\n\n\nI got a shock when I first saw that double bass - - your had to stand\nand play it, it had a heavy bow and the strings are fat.\n\n\nBut I went on, because with my piano playing, I could read the music\neasily, and my left hand could cope with the strain.\n\n\nThe BCO,\"  he goes on to state,  \" takes the place of\nthe missing school of music in Bombay.\n\n\nIt exposes you to a wide range of instruments and to all the\ndifferent eras of music - - right from the baroque, classical to the romantic\nand modern - - which is invaluable to those studying music seriously.\"\n The BCO, Noel adds,  \" forces you to get your sight-reading\nact together, to listen to the other instruments, to play together.\n\n\nAnd how! Mario Nazareth, conductor of the Cathedral and himself a\nLicentiate of the London Trinity College of Music, with a  diploma in pianoforte playing, is all praise for the enthusiastiic\ntalent in the BCO.\n\n\n\" The backbone of the BCO - - the string section - - is very good.\n\n\nVisiting conductors ( again sponsored by the British Council and Max\nMueller Bhavan) have always been very happy with their performance.\n\n\nAnd the achievement of other standard comes despite the fact that\nthey only receive conveyance money for their efforts.\n\n\nMany of them travel from distant suburbs to give their time\nunstintingly.\n\n\nAnd the feeling of blending among them is very good; together, they\nfollow a  cue well.\"  \n\n \n\nStill, however seriously the young instrumentalists may take\ntheir musical pursuits, and however good they are, they all recognise that,\nin India, there is a minimal scope for music as a career - - except as a\nteacher.\n\n\n \" Music as a career in India is a risky thing to bank on,\"\n says Ashwin,  \" You always need something to fall back on.\"\n\n\n\nWhile Kenneth jokes that he may take up teaching music when he\nretires, Noel is working to assure himself of a job by also learning\ncomputers, even as he plays on interesting commercials like the ones for\nDamania Airways or Monte Carlo on shifts of four hours each.\n\n\n \" Working in the music industry like I do is difficult.\n\n\n paying but getting the assignments is hard.\n\n\nThe field of film music offers you no recognition, no promotions, no\nbenefits, and only wages for assignemnts.\n\n\nIt cannot be a career.\"  \n\n \n\nBut just because they are realistic enough to know it holds no\nmonetary promise doesn't mean they have regrets about the time they have\nspent on it already.\n\n\n \" It is not possible to regret giving your time to music,\"\n says Marlisa,  \" It soothes your life.\" \n\n\nAs Noel puts it,  \" Time spent on music is time well spent: I\nwould have done nothing else more worthwhile in that time.\" \n\n\nIt doesn't mean that they are unaware of the fact that friends and\nacquaintances don't always think nice things about what they do.\n\n\n \" My friends say they don't understand the music,\" \nsays Noel,  \" but then you need to spend time with it for that.\n\n\n often been teased - - that I play a coffin, when a\nguitar is more  ` hep'.\"  \n\n\n \" It doesn't bother me,\"  insists Marlisa.\n\n\nKenneth feels people appreciate the fact that he remains faithful to\nthe piano when  \" the rest of the world is playing the more\naccessible, easier-to-master and more popular keyboards.\n\n\nYou never get the same fullness of sound on the keyboards, as you\nwill on a piano,\"  he reveals. \n\n \n\nThey have weighed the options, and found their own way the best.\n\n\nChristine:  \" I listen to pop, rock, some Indian classical <*>\ndotted line</*>\"  \n\n \n\n \" Everything but hard rock,\"  says Noel.\n\n\nBut their choice seems clear.\n\n\n \" Rap,\"  says Kenneth vehemently,  \" is no\nlonger music - -  rhythm and words.\n\n\nMusic should be harmony and melody; without harmony, there can be no\nmusic.\"  \n\n \n\nBombay, then, has discerning musical genius.\n\n\nSays Jini,  \" I have an eight-year-old Bengali boy, Jeet\nMajumdar, studying with me now,  playing Bach double concertos\nafter just a year and a half.\n\n\nAnd he will most probably transfer to the Menuhin school.\" \n\n\nLosing young musical genius is something that is almost inevitable,\nJini feels, especially when, after studying abroad, talent like that of the\noutstanding flautist Dilshad Billimoria ( now at  Royal\nAcademy) and her brother Farhad ( now in Vienna ) have nothing to come back\nto.\n\n\nMarialena Fernandes, another outstanding pianist, is now teaching at\nthe Vienna Academy.\n\n\n \" If we want our young people to come back and pass on their\nknowledge, we must offer them some concrete way they can help,\"  Jini\nsays.\n\n\n \" But, at a time when even singing has been stopped in so\nmany schools, all I can do is hope and dream.\"  \n\n \n\nAnd so her BCO students go on.\n\n\nDevoting Sunday morning to an aboe and violin and chords and tempo,\nrather than a sleep-in and bacon and eggs.\n\n\nLooking forward to concerts, even though they mean practices at\nseven in the morning.\n\n\nIf music soothes the savage breast, its glory can be seen, untamed,\nin the hands of young musicians  made an ancient choice.\n\n\nThis is one lot of youth that Channel V will not conquer.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "66f9d5c9-adb8-49a7-bbce-5477a63cdfaa", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.122907+00:00"}
{"text": "Impacts of Dust Pollution   \n\n\nS.P. Agarwal and M.K. Agarwal*\n\n\n Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee  - 247667  \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nThe industrial revolution brought the comforts to the mankind in\nabundance but at the same time this brought with it miseries and discomforts\nto mankind as well.\n\n\nThe alarming increase in the population in India, increased the\nneed of various commodities in large quantities.\n\n\nMan is a nonseparable and dependent part of nature.\n\n\nMan has substantial influence over nature too and, therefore, he\nderives all his food, clothing, shelter and other needs from nature. \n\n \n\nThe \" air \" , \" water \" ,\n\" soil \" , \" plants \" and \" trees\n\" , \" animals \" , etc., all constitute the\nenvironment.\n\n\nThese constituents keep on interacting with each other to maintain a\nmutual balance.\n\n\nThis mutual balance is called the  \" ` ecological\nbalance' \"  .\n\n\nThe use of nature, for fulfilling the requirements of man, by man\ncauses certain changes in the environment and thus the ecological\nimbalances.\n\n\nIf population is small, the effect on the environment is also\nproportionally small provided the other conditions remain unchanged.\n\n\nIn developing countries, like ours, where the process of development\nputs a severe strain on the environment, the increase of population also\nadds a lot to the environmental strain.\n\n\nThe emphasis of all the dedeveloping countries is on the economic\ndevelopment and normally this leads to generation of wastes in solid, liquid,\nand gaseous forms and the deterioration of the living environment.\n\n\nDuring the early stages of industrialisation, the environmental\nimpacts of indstrial effluents did not pose any problems because the\nlimited pace of development.\n\n\nWith the increasing rate of industrial development and the\npopulaation explosion, the environmental damage became a growing concern\nto people in general and to environmental lists in particular or rather it\nhas become a global problem.\n\n\nMore it has beome a mandatory requirement of every mankind to help in\ncontrolling it.\n\n\nIt is essential to understand the magnitude of the task confronting\nthe developing world to maintain the cleanliness of the environment, while\nkeeping up the pace of industrialisation. \n\n\n  MAGNITUDE OF DUST POLLUTION OF AIR  \n\n \n\n \" ` Good quality of life' \" \nessentially indicate minimum supply or availability of food, cloth and\nshelter to all of us as per old concept.\n\n\nNow  \" ` good quality of life' \" \nliterally means availability of clean air, fresh water, noise free\nenvironment, better communication and transportation system, better\nmedical facilities, etc., besides other needs of life.\n\n\nThe amount of air breathed and the oxygen consumed vary with the task\nperformed and with the  size.\n\n\nNormal frequency of breathing in adults at rest ranges from 10 to\n24 breaths / min and the volume of air moved in or out of lungs with each\nbreath is about 500 cc.\n\n\nThe minute ventilation which is the volume of air moved in or out of\nlungs in 1 min ranges from 6 to 10 lit / min for normal resting subjects at\nsea level.\n\n\nThe inspiratory and expiratory phases are not exactly same, but\npractically it may be considered each as taking half the time required for a\ncomplete respiratory cycle.\n\n\nThus with a minute volume ( insipiratory) of 6 - 10 lit of air and\nthis 6 - 10 lit of air will be inspirated in half time only which implies\nthat the actual inspiration is at the rate of 12 - 20 lit / min, that is the\ninhalation rate of air is quite high.\n\n\nIf a little volume, that is 1 lit / min of oxygen is required for\nsome work than about 20.25 lit / min voume of air ( volume at 15 <*>\ndegrees</*>C and 760 mm pressure of mercury ) would be required to breath\nin.\n\n\nNormally an average human breathes about 11,500 lit of air ( volume\nat 15 <*> degrees</*>C and 760 mm pressure of mercury) every day.\n\n\nThis clearly indicates how large amount of pollutants are being\ninhaled by our body daily.\n\n\nAs reported ambient air of Delhi city contains about 300 - 500 <*>\nmu</*>g / m3 of air of particulate matter and one inhales more\nthan 3 - 5 mg of particulates per day. \n\n\n  TYPES OF DUST    \n\n \n\nBefore discussing the impacts of dust pollution on human beings,\nit is essential to know briefly about various types of dusts, reaction of\nbody and lungs to inhaled dusts.\n\n\nFirst we will discuss the types of dust from health point of view.\n\n\nDust ( aerosols composed of solid inanimate particles ) can be\nclassified in the following ways. \n\n\n  Inorganic dust and organic dust  \n\n \n\nInorganic dust is responsible for pneumoconiosis.\n\n\nVarious examples of inorganic dust are \" silica dust\n\" , \" coal dust \" , \" asbestos dust\n\" , etc.\n\n\nOrganic dust usually results in bronchial asthma or hypersensitivity\npneumonitis.\n\n\nExamples of organic dust are \" thermophilic actinomycetes\n\" , \" micropolyspora faeni \" , \"\nmicromonospora vulgaris \" , \" aspergillus clavatus\n\" , \" aspergillus fumigatus \" , etc. \n\n\n  Active and inert dust  \n\n \n\nFew dusts are inert and does not do structurally any harm to the\nlungs ( however, can cause some functional impairment if inhaled in\nsufficient quantity for a longer period ) .\n\n\nExamples are \" tin \" , \" iron \" ,\n\" barium \" , etc.\n\n\nContrary to the inert dust, few dust are active and potential to\ncause pulmonary fibrosis ( fibrogenic dust ) .\n\n\nThese dusts ( for example coal dust, silica dust, etc. ) , do\nstructurally harm to the lungs. \n\n\n  Industrial and environmental dust  \n\n \n\nExamples of industrial dust are \" coal dust \" ,\n\" silica \" , \" beryllium \" , \"\nabestos \" , etc.\n\n\nExamples of environmental dust are dust caused by storms, forest\nfires, etc. \n\n\n  Outdoor and indoor dust  \n\n \n\nDust in the outdoor environment is called outdoor dust while in\nindoor environment ( for example room air ) is called indoor dust.\n\n\nOther examples of indoor air dust are smoke dust as a part of\ncooking or smoking, dust due to air conditioner units ( defective units /\nimproper maintenance ) , shoe dust, dust due to moisture on walls, etc. \n\n\n  Respirable and inspirable dust  \n\n \n\nDust containing particles less than 7 micron size is called\n\" respirably \" ( enters into lungs ) while dust containing\nparticles more than 7 micron size is called \" inspirable dust\n\" ( can not enter into lungs ) . \n\n\n  ACTION OF BODY AND LUNGS TO INHALED DUST  \n\n \n\nNature has provided a very efficient filter mechanism of dust\nparticles in our body.\n\n\nAll particles greater than 7 micron    size \n ( inspirable dust ) are likely to be trapped either in the nose or high\nin the throat.\n\n\nFor example a dust particle of the size of a common pollen grain (\n15 to 25 <*> mu</*> ) is likely to be caught in the nasal passages or at the\nback of the throat.\n\n\nThe particles smaller than 7 micron size ( respirable dust ) will\nenter into trachea ( wind    pipe   ) and lungs.\n\n\nThe bigger particle of respirable dust are able to reach the\nproximal airways while the smaller particles are able to reach the more\ndistal airways and alveoli.\n\n\nParticles reaching the proximal airways ( bronchi ) may by\neliminated by ciliary blanket while particles reaching alveoli are eliminated\nby other mechanisms. \n\n \n\nWithin the alveoli there are other cells called phagocytes\nwhich are brought out is vast horders by the stimulus of foreign bodies, such\nas dust particles, which they engulf.\n\n\nThese dust laden cells, which have the power of independent motion,\nmay pass through the walls of the lung tissues into the lymph.\n\n\nMost of the dust laden cells, however, migrate into the lymphatic\nsystem.\n\n\nVarious bifurcations of trachea and bronchi, the considerable\namounts of dust is deposited by the phagocytic cells at tracheobronchial\nlymph nodes and from here the healthy lung tissue starts damaging.\n\n\nIn general, once the dust is inhaled, the reaction of lung depends on\n7 factors each of which is important in itself but all of which must be\nconsidered in combination, since they are to a certain extent interdependent.\n\n\nThese factors are: \n\n\n  Chemical nature of dust  \n\n \n\nSome dusts are harmful to the lungs while the others are\nchemically inert. \n\n\n  Size of dust particles  \n\n \n\nThree main physical processes determine particle deposition in\nlungs - - \" inertial impaction \" , \" sedimentation\n\" and \" diffusion \" .\n\n\nNearly all particles more than 3 micron but less than 7 mscrons\nare deposited in walls of tranchea and bronchi by inertial impaction.\n\n\nThe majority of particles less than 3 microns in diameter are\ndeposited in respiratory bronchioles or alveoli, chiefly by mechanism of\ndiffusion but partly by sedimenation. \n\n\n  Distribution of inhaled dust  \n\n \n\nAs also mentioned above some particles have the  tendency to be deposited in upper part of the lungs, while some in\nlower parts of lungs.\n\n\nObviously these particles will exert their harmful effects at the\nsite of distribution. \n\n\n  Concentration of dust particles  \n\n \n\nAbility of healthy lung to cope with introduction of dust\nparticles is related roughly to the concentration of airborne dust\ninhaled.\n\n\nLess than 10 particles of 5 micron / ml can be completely eliminated,\nwhereas only about 90 % of a concentration of approximately 1000 such\nparticles / ml will be eliminated and the retained 10 % can produce a slowly\ndeveloping pneumoconiosis.\n\n\nWith concentrations as high as 1,000,000 particles / ml, a very higy\nproportion is retained and lung disease can develop rapidly. \n\n\n  Duration of exposure  \n\n \n\nThe great majority of cases of pneumoconiosis develop only\nafter many years of dust exposure.\n\n\nHowever, individual susceptibility also plays a role and\npneumoconiosis is also possible after brief exposure provided the individual\nis highly susceptible. \n\n\n  Individual susceptibility  \n\n \n\nDifferent individuals with identical dust exposure may have\ndifferent reactions : one may be free of disease while another may show\nadvanced progressive stage. \n\n\n  Clearance of dust particles  \n\n \n\nThis is accomplished by one or both of 2 mechanism - \ntransport up by the mucociliary escalator and lymphalic drainage. \n\n\n  IMPACTS OF DUST POLLUTION ON HUMAN BEINGS  \n\n \n\nNow it is the appropriate time to discuss impacts of dust\npollution on human beings.\n\n\nBasically there are 4 major areas of pollution, namely \" air\n\" , \" water \" , \" noise \" and\n\" soil \" which are mainly concerned with human beings.\n\n\nAmong these here the impacts due to particulate pollutants of air\nwill be discussed.\n\n\nSuspensions of finely divided particles in air in the form of\nfogs and mists are common natural phenomena.\n\n\nSuch type of suspensions are generally caused by storms, forest\nfires, etc.\n\n\nOn the other hand, within certain industries contamination of the\natmosphere with dust has long presented a problem.\n\n\nDust constitutes a nuisance and creates poor working conditions.\n\n\nThe control of these industrial and other dusts continues as a\nnever ending battle.\n\n\nThe severity of air pollution caused by particulate matter can be\nunderstood further by knowing the diseases for which dust pollution is\nresponsible.\n\n\nExposure to dust can produce several distinct types of diseases in\nthe body : \n\n \n\n1. Pneumoconioses are caused by various dusts, for example coal\n pneumoconiosis, silicosis, etc. \n\n \n\n2. Lung cancer may be caused by various occupational dusts,\nlike \" asbestos \" , \" nickel \" , \"\nchromium salts \" , \" arsenic \" , \"\nchloroether \" , \" mustard gas \" , etc. \n\n \n\n3. \" Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis \" - - a\ndisease of lung characterised by restriction in lung inflation leading to\nprogressive dyspnoea and death, may be caused by : ( a) Occupational and\nenvironmental dust, like \" silica \" , \" asbestos\n\" , \" talc \" , \" kaolin \" ,\n\" coal \" , \" cobalt \" , \" graphite\n\" , etc., ( b) Organic dust, like \" actinomycetes \"\n, \" penicillium spp \" ., \" aspergillus spp\n\" ., etc., ( c) Toxic fumes and vapours, for example \"\nchlorine \" , \" nitrogen oxide \" , \"\nsulphuric acid \" , \" heavy metals \" , etc. \n\n \n\n4. \" Chronic bronchitis and emphysema \" a\ndisease of marked morbidity and mortality is more prevalent in heavily\npolluted areas than in less polluted areas. \n\n \n\n5. \" Pulmonary oedema \" - - a condition of lung\ncharacterised by exudlation of fluid in the alveoli and marked dyspnoea\nmay be caused when air polluted with toxic inhalants is inhaled suddenly.\n\n\n \n\n6. \" Bronchiectasis-even bronchiectasis \" may\nbe caused by inhalation of polluted air.\n\n\nAssociation of aspergillar species and proximal bronchiectasis is\nwell known. \n\n \n\n7. \" Bronchial asthma \" - - a disease of lungs\ncharacterised by episodic attacks of breathlessness, may be caused by\nhouse dust and fungal spores apart from pollens.\n\n\nExacerbations of bronchial asthma are more common in areas where air\nis polluted.\n\n\nOne variety of bronchial asthma is occupational asthma in which the\nsymptoms appear at work place and the patient is free from symptoms at\nweekend aad holidays. \n\n \n\n8. \" Hypersensitivity pneumonitis \" - - a\ndisease of lungs affecting alveoli and mainefesting as breathlessness may be\ncaused by a variety of organic dusts. \n\n \n\n\" Mycoses-pulmonary mycoses \" may be caused by\ninhalation of polluted air with fungal spores.\n\n\nWhen fungal spores are inhaled they can lead to asthma, alergic\nalveolitis or colonisation in lung and tissue damage leading to frank\npulmonary mycoses.\n\n\nExamples  of mycoses is allergic\nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis due to inhalation of aspergillus spores.\n\n\n \n\n10. \" Rhinitis \" , \" sinusitis\n\" , \" ottitis \" , \" conjunctivitis-allergy\n\" to pollens, fungi and air pollutants may lead to development of\nrhinitis ( a nasal problem characterised by itching, sneezing, running and\nblocking of nose ) , sinusitis ( causes pain in face and headache ) ,\nottitis ( inflamation of ear ) , conjuntivities ( it causes itching, watering\nand discharge from eyes ) . \n\n \n\n11. \" Contact dermatitis \" mostly caused by\nphysical contact but aerosols suspended in environment may be the cause ( air\nborne contact dermatitis ) . \n\n \n\n12. \" Atopic eczema \" and \" contact\nurticarias \" are allergic disorders of skin, sometimes aggravated\nby biologically derived aerosols. \n\n \n\n13. \" Metal fume fever \" is caused by inhaling\ncertain metalic oxide fumes. \n\n \n\n14. Systemic toxic effects are produced as the result of\neither breathing or swallowing of certain dusts, for example lead and\nmanganese. \n\n \n\n15. \" Mycotoxicosis \" is a rare toxic response\nto products from certain moulds, producing fatigue, irritability and\ninflamation of the heart. \n\n \n\n16. \" The sick building syndrome \" consists of\na number of symptoms, namely : ( a) eye, nose and throat irritation, ( b)\nsensation of dry mucous membranes, skin erythama, ( c) mental fatigue,\nheadache, nausea, dizziness, ( d) high frequency of airway infection and\ncough, and ( e) hoarseness, wheezing, unspecified hypersensitivity.\n\n\nCauses of syndrame are many, namely ( <roman = lower.case> 1\n</roman = lower.case> ) sealed buidings, <roman = lower.case> 2\n</roman = lower.case> non-openable windows, <roman = lower.case> 3\n</roman = lower.case> tight enclosure dwellings, <roman = lower.case> 4\n</roman = lower.case> increased temperature and dust levels, and\n<roman = lower.case> 5 </roman = lower.case> passive cigrette smoking.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2323b99b-53c2-4d92-90c6-23902436060f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.124357+00:00"}
{"text": "The Future Of English In India  \n\n \n\nEnglish, as the language of the British, came to India with them.\n\n\nThe Englishmen came to India and stayed    on\nhere   as the rulers till they were driven out of India by the \n  non-violent   fight started by Mahatma\nGandhi.\n\n\nNearly four decades after we have won freedom, we still continue with\nEnglish.\n\n\nIt has been given a place in the schedule of languages under  the constitution.\n\n\nIn the constitution, Hindi has been given the status of National\nlanguage, but has allowed English to be an associate language.\n\n\nEnglish has been more popular  than Hindi in many\nSouthern and eastern states of India.\n\n\nThey find English more comfortable and easier language for\ncommunication.\n\n\nThere is doubt that  whether English will go away\nor would continue for a long period in India. \n\n \n\nMany Hindi favouring people say that when we have driven out\nEnglishmen from our country there is no meaning in carrying on our activities\nin every field in English.\n\n\nHindi is said to be spoken by majority of the people in India so it\nshould replace English.\n\n\nAnd those who  oppose Hindi say that not Hindi but its\nsub-languages ( dialects) are in common use.\n\n\nThe    argument   still goes on, that\nif Hindi is used instead of English, the southern region will be adversely\naffected.\n\n\nAs the people can't understand and speak Hindi well, English is given\n   prominence   .\n\n\nThis controversy raises the question of the future of English in\nIndia. \n\n \n\nMany feel that English must continue here.\n\n\nToday even an illiterate person is able to understand some English\nwords.\n\n\nIt has been the most popular language all over and is still a\npowerful language.\n\n\nToday there are many nursery schools and convents started which give\nthe education in the medium of English.\n\n\nThese schools have    sprung   up almost\nin every city of India.\n\n\nAlso more and more people are trying to give their children the best\nschool needed for    their   education.\n\n\nToday even the poorest or lowest man like servants etc. , \nwant their children to be grown up as a convent student.\n\n\n Irrespective of the cost he has to pay f  or  the  progress, he is ready to\npay.\n\n\nThe significance of English is growing day by day. \n\n \n\nEnglish has a greater influence than any other foreign language\nin India.\n\n\nWe have switched    on to   English as it\nis universally spoken and understood in almost all parts of the world.\n\n\nOn the contrary French and Chinese languages are also equally\nprominent in  the world.\n\n\nMany say that why only English ?\n\n\nWe can take up French or Chinese  too.\n\n\nBut this is highly impossible for a nation to give up English totally\nand adopt another associate language.\n\n\nFor this we require good French teachers or Chinese teachers who can\nteach us efficiently.\n\n\nThen we also have to  take a look on the\nconstitution and its laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the laws are amended in English language, we would have to\ntranslate all those in French or Chinese.\n\n\nAnd to do all this work is of no use.\n\n\nIt will just create a chaos and mess.\n\n\nLike the statement ( Proverb)  \" A bird in hand, is worth two\nin the bush.\"   \n\n \n\nNowadays, all the scientists, physicians, mathematicians, \n  experimenter  etc.  ,  across the world\nhave taken English, as their language of study.\n\n\nAll these books are written or printed in English.\n\n\nSo to read and understand the scientific  ,\ntechnological development and their views and ideas we have to stick  to English.\n\n\nToday, in India many books and newspapers are also published in the\nmaster language ( English).\n\n\nAs  \" Rome was not built in a day\",  adopting a second\nlanguage is dangerous, ( impossible) because  \" Prevention is better\nthan cure.\" \n\n\nIt is wise to continue with English. \n\n \n\nEvery year the international conferences and meetings,  are held with different nations.\n\n\nThese countries have a language of their own.\n\n\nIt is difficult for one to converse with another in \nown ( national) language.\n\n\nIn such cases, English comes in use.\n\n\nAs mentioned above  many people can speak and understand\nEnglish through the world, English is found to be a language of significance.\n\n\nAnd if exceptionally someone sepaks in  own national\nlanguage and  can't understand.\n\n\nThe speech given out by the speaker is translated into English.\n\n\nThey prefer English to be translated as it is not possible for  one to translate in many languages & hence English plays a\ndominating role. \n\n \n\nThis is a    controversy  \nwhich will continue many many hereafter.\n\n\nIt is just a wastage of time.\n\n\n English, as a matter of fact is a very important,\ninteresting and a wonderful language.\n\n\nThis has been agreed by many writers, thinkers & scholars.\n\n\nChakraborthy Raj Gopalacharya also said the same. \n\n \n\nEnglish has done a great deal of work in the progress and\ndevelopment of India.\n\n\nThe British are responsible for this because they brought this\nlanguage ( Masters Language) to India.\n\n\n And it proved to be of a great help to Indians.\n\n\nBut they did so for their own interest.\n\n\nThe first school in English was started in 1817 by \nDavid Hair.\n\n\nThen English spread its arms wider & wider, and has come to this\nstage and proved to  be  dominating. \n\n \n\nThere is no doubt about  ` The Future of English In India'\n will be bright.\n\n\nThe only thing is that the Indians must try and come forward to\naccept English.\n\n\nIt will continue for many more decades or may be centuries.  \n\n\n\n\n  Should    mothers   go to\nwork  ? \n\n \n\nIn early period, there was no too much importance to education of\n   women,   or girls.\n\n\n   women   are not more educated.\n\n\nThey had many restrictions.\n\n\n   men   do not want to give education to\n   women   & send them for work.\n\n\n   Women    were  asked to do\nonly the house-hold work just as servant of home.\n\n\nIt is our tradition that    women  \nwork at home &    men   went outside to earn\nmoney. \n\n \n\nBut after independance, importance for  education\nis increased.\n\n\nMahatma Phule also started school for    women\n  .\n\n\nThere was a great development of    women \n in all fields of science, technology.\n\n\nNow, there is no work which can perform only by  but it\nis impossible for woman. \n\n \n\nEvery woman has to play various    roles \n such as sister, mother, wife, daughter in her life.\n\n\nBut in all roles her  role is very important.\n\n\nOur religion considered woman as very powerful.\n\n\nThere are various examples which proved that they are very\nintelligent, brave, like men's  .\n\n\nsuch as Rani Lakhsmibai, Rani Rupmati, in early period, Indira\nGandhi, Sarojini Naidu in later period.\n\n\nThese    women   devoted themselves for\ndevelopment of country.\n\n\nBut they do not forget their duty in personal life like mother,\nsister, wife etc.\n\n\nThey do these duties very efficiently & successfully.\n\n\nNow, at present, we find    women   in\nall    fields   of education, science,\ntechnology, army, arts, painting, designing, etc.\n\n\nIn all these    fields   they show their\nskill, intelligence power etc.\n\n\nThey went for service everywhere in their day to-day life. \n\n \n\nNow, the question arises  ` Should  \n mothers   go to work' \n\n\nI think it is very difficult to answer this question.\n\n\nAs there are two    sides   of answer in\nthis question.\n\n\nOne side is that in modern age,    women \n are very educated.\n\n\nSo they do not want to stay at home.\n\n\nThey want to make something creative according to their ability &\nwhich suited to their personality.\n\n\nPopulation is also goes on increasing, needs of people    increase   so prices of   \ngoods  & services reached their maximum level.\n\n\nTherefore, generally, in all houses both husband & wife are working\nto earn more money & to satisfy their needs.\n\n\nYoung boys commands educated girls who are in service for    marriage   & educated girls also want to make their\ncareers. \n\n \n\nAll these points are correct from point of view of modern girls &\nboys but when she became a mother of her child she must concentrate her mind\nto look after her child.\n\n\nBecause it is the time when she had to develop her child who  will\n    become   a leader of this great nation\nof tomorrow.\n\n\nIf at this stage    children   are\nneglected, there may be bad effects on innocent mind of children. \n\n \n\nIn modern age,    mothers   \n  go   for work by leaving their small baby in hands\nof servant.\n\n\nThen she remains out of work normally for whole day & keep busy in\nher routine work.\n\n\nFather of child had also no time to look after him.\n\n\nSo she    does   not know    whether   the servant takes proper care of child or not.\n\n\n \n\nI think every child till he reaches age of 12 years wants the\nneed of his mother in every work at all time  - e.g home-work,\ndiscussing certain matters like gathering, competition etc.\n\n\nIf    mothers   go to work then after\nreturning to home they get very tired.\n\n\nSo they become upset & depressed.\n\n\nInstead of solving problems of children, they   \nget   angry towards them.\n\n\nAnd in above all    scenes   no role\nis assigned to father because he solve some difficulties but to certain\nextent otherwise they also    get   angry towards\nthem.\n\n\nIt means need of mother in  life cannot be filled\nby father.\n\n\n   Children   are always \nthreatened  of their father.\n\n\nThey can talk more freely with their mother instead of father in\neach & every problem.\n\n\nWhen a small baby    begins   to cry you\nhave noticed that    sometimes   father or any\nother failed to make  him     quiet   .\n\n\nBut when he goes in hands of his mother, he  \n  immedietly quiet   . \n\n \n\nThen the question arises    whether \n  ` Should mothers go to work'  or not.\n\n\nThen for this question I want to say that mothers must go to work,\nit is necessary to show their    talent   ,\nefficiency, intelligency in the development of nation.\n\n\nI don't want to say that    mothers  \nonly maintain their house or to take care of their children.\n\n\nBut when    children   reach at\ntheir maturity level if financially    ability \n permitted.\n\n\nIf financial position is poor then they must go to work but they\nleave their small baby in hands of some   \nresponsible   person to whom you trusts fully. \n\n \n\nWe must remember that India is also our mother & we have to make\nIndia best in all services by serving & helping in the world.\n\n\nAt present, many mothers may    prove  \nas a good    teacher   or good army officer or\ngood justice or good doctors.\n\n\nThey helped to a great extent to India.\n\n\nWe must not forget their contribution to India.\n\n\nSome     women   also became\na chief minister of some of Indian states today. \n\n \n\nAs per my    opinion      women   or mothers must work outside & make their\ncareer but they must not forget their duties in regard to home, children etc.\n\n\nThe    primary   duty of every mother\nis to look after their children & to take care of their home.\n\n\nBecause the need of mother from point of children can not  be\n filled by any person in the earth.", "subdomain":

the first crooked teeth  seen in America - with a gap between his front teeth wide enough to hold\na matchstick.\n\n\nHe had a blondish beard.\n\n\nWylie was tall and blond, thin as a schoolgirl, with a pair of dark\nglasses pushed high in her hair, and a pair of regular glasses resting on her\nchest, held by a chain around her neck.\n\n\nDuff immediately asked my name and where I was from.\n\n\n  \" You know where India is, darling.\n\n\nRemember, we found it on the map.\"  \n\n\nShe took out a piece of paper and tried to spell my name.\n\n\nI had never seen a small child, especially a girl, who could\nimmediately relate to adults, call them by their first names, and break into\ntheir conversations. \n\n \n\nShe asked Kate,   \"  my Sammy?\"\n \n\n\nKate reminded her that Sam and city buses were not on good terms.\n\n\nThe one time  taken him on a bus, wrapped like a baby\nbut for his breathing holes, the crested tail had popped from the blanket,\nthe tongue had darted, and a man sitting next to them had drawn a knife in\nself-defense.\n\n\nThereafter she left him at home in what Duff called \nOcean. \n\n \n\nI asked what kind of pets the Hayeses had.\n\n\nFortunately, the university permitted nothing as exotic as iguanas\nand snakes, only the usual dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, gerbils - none of\nwhich Duff could tolerate because of allergies. \n\n \n\n \" We might have to move if Duff wants an ostrich or\nsomething,\"  said Taylor.\n\n\nDuff giggled.\n\n\nKate prompted me to smile. \n\n \n\nSilence fell.\n\n\nI nibbled a biscuit. \n\n \n\n \" I hope\n\n$95 a week is satisfactory,\"  said Wylie.\n\n\n  \"  checked around, and  a\nlittle low, but there really shouldn't be any other expenses - \" \n \n\n \n\nI had not imagined money,  dollars  , for sleeping with\na child.\n\n\n \" That is very good,\"  I said. \n\n \n\n \"  not going to ask you for references,\nJasmine,\"  she went on.\n\n\n  \"  already told us something about you.\n\n\nLillian  word is solid gold with us.\n\n\nYou will be part of the family.\n\n\nFamilies don't go around requiring references.\"  \n\n\n \n\n \" Anyway, Sam already approved you,\"  said\nTaylor.\n\n\n  \" Being cold-blooded, he doesn't warm to many people.\n\n\nIn fact, he has a godlike perspective on the whole mammal class.\"\n  \n\n \n\nHe smiled his crooked-toothed smile, and I began to fall in love.\n\n\nI mean, I fell in love with what he represented to me, a professor\nwho served biscuits to a servant, smiled at her, and admitted her to the\nbroad democracy of his joking, even when she didn't understand it.\n\n\nIt seemed entirely American.\n\n\nI was curious about his life, not repulsed.\n\n\nI wanted to know the way such a man lives in this country.\n\n\nI wanted to watch, be a part of it.\n\n\nHe seemed wondrously extravagant, that Sunday morning. \n\n \n\n \" He likes to be rubbed on the stomach,\"  I said.\n\n\n \n\n  \" Fastest way to an iguanas heart.\n\n\nEveryone knows  that  .\"   \n\n \n\n  \" Oh, Daddy,  really  .\"  \n\n\nDuff frowned. \n\n \n\n \" I can tell you are a refined person,\"  Wylie\ncontinued.\n\n\n  \" We ask only for affection and intelligence in dealing\nwith Duff.\n\n\nA child raised by affectionate, intelligent people with a good sense\nof humor will grow up all right.\"   \n\n \n\n \" That, and getting into Brearley,\"  Taylor\nremarked. \n\n \n\n \" I don't think I have much humor,\"  I said.\n\n\nThe decent Americans  seen on television seemed a\nwhimsical people, always making jokes, like Kate and Taylor.\n\n\nWylie was a serious woman, all duty and business, like Lillian\nGordon.\n\n\nThe ones  met in person were not too funny.\n\n\n the hardest thing to translate. \n\n \n\nDuff, she said, was enrolled in a play school at the Riverside\nChurch.\n\n\nThis would leave my mornings free.\n\n\nThere would be lunch to prepare, her nap, and maybe strolls in the\npark or trips around town.\n\n\nVery little television.\n\n\nI was to stimulate her with questions, engage her with stories, read\nto her, go to museums, puppet shows, galleries.\n\n\nNext year she might be in an all-day school, which would leave me\nfree to investigate classes myself.\n\n\n help any way they could. \n\n \n\n  \"  probably tired of Americans\nassuming that if  from India or China or the Caribbean you\nmust be good with children,\"   said Wylie. \n\n \n\n \" Thank you,\"  I replied.\n\n\nWhat else could I say?\n\n\nI had never heard such a thing.\n\n\nThe Chinese I had always thought of as genetically cruel to women and\nchildren - - even in Hasnapur we knew about foot-binders - and my experience\nof Caribbeans was a mixture of fear and pity. \n\n \n\n \" Ancient American custom, dark-skinned mammies.\n\n\nDon't be flattered by it,\"  said Taylor. \n\n \n\n \" In fact,\"  said Wylie,  \" we assume  be times when you absolutely hate her and want to wring her\nneck.\"  \n\n \n\n \" We suggest counting to ten first,\"  said\nTaylor. \n\n \n\nDuff was drawing and coloring and didn't raise her head. \n\n \n\nWylie showed me around.\n\n\n \" Sixteen hundred square feet,\"  she said,  \"\nso I don't think either of us will feel crowded.\" \n\n\nShe opened and shut doors of closets, pulled open drawers on the\nsmoothest of rollers, revealing gadgets I had no idea how to use, patted\ndials on the dishwasher, and rested fingertips on the start-up panel of a\nsleek microwave.\n\n\n \" If you have a thing about radiation, you don't have to use\nit,\"  she said.\n\n\n  \" You just let us know when we upset you, all right?\"\n  \n\n \n\n \" I don't have a thing about radiation,\"  I said.\n\n\n \n\nWe stood on the narrow balcony and looked out on Claremont Avenue\nas Wylie gave me facts about Taylor, Duff, and herself.\n\n\nTaylor, a  professorji  , was an expert in an area of\nsubnuclear particle physics.\n\n\nWylie was a book editor for a publisher on Park Avenue.\n\n\nAbout her work she said, dismissively,   \" You can call my\nwriters the New Sob Sisters.\n\n\nWe ghoul around courtrooms and develop projects.\"  \n\n\nShe explained about the money to be made signing up celebrity\ninterviews, writing about divorces and drug cases, society murders, child\nabuse, and rape.\n\n\nShe made them sound like grave robbers. \n\n \n\nI didn't have the slightest understanding of anything they said,\nand they didn't bother explaining.\n\n\nI liked that the assumption behind it.  \n\n \n\nWylie said that Duff was adopted. \n\n \n\n \" Low sperm count,\"  she explained. \n\n \n\nI blushed, but neither Wylie nor Taylor noticed. \n\n \n\n \" Hockey injury,\"  Taylor protested. \n\n \n\nThey planned to tell Duff everything when she was old enough.\n\n\n even let her meet her natural mother currently a\nsophomore at Iowa State University.\n\n\nTheir lawyer had placed ads in small-town Iowa and Nebraska and\nKansas newspapers, asking pregnant unwed girls to contact him.\n\n\nWylie and Taylor were paying for the  education.\n\n\nI remember thinking an Iowa newspaper must be in a language called\nIowan, like a Punjabi or a Spanish newspaper.\n\n\nI liked the mystery.\n\n\nDuff looked perfectly American. \n\n \n\n \" We could have gotten a child out of Paraguay,\"\n Taylor explained.\n\n\n  \" The Needhams on the sixth floor got their baby from\nParaguay.\n\n\nThey had to go down and hang around for six weeks in this nothing\nvillage full of Nazi war criminals, and the way they described the whole\nthing, it sounded awful, sort of like a direct sale.\"   \n\n \n\nI could not imagine a non-genetic child.\n\n\nA child that was not my own, or my  , struck me as\na monstrous idea.\n\n\nAdoption was as foreign to me as the idea of widow remarriage. \n\n \n\nI looked out into the dorm windows across Claremont Avenue.\n\n\nThe windows were long, bright, shadeless rectangles of light.\n\n\nNo window shades, no secrets.\n\n\nBarnard women were studying cross-legged on narrow beds, changing\nT-shirts, clowning with Walkmans clamped to their heads.\n\n\nThey wore nothing under their shirts and sweaters.\n\n\nMen were in their room.\n\n\nEven on the first morning I saw naked bodies combing their hair in\nfront of dresser mirrors.\n\n\nTruly there was no concept of shame in this society.\n\n\n die before a Sob Sister asked me about Half-Face. \n\n\n \n\nThe love I felt for Taylor that first day had nothing to do with\nsex.\n\n\nI fell in love with his world, its ease, its careless confidence and\ngraceful self-absorption.\n\n\nI wanted to become the person they thought they saw: humorous,\nintelligent, refined, affectionate.\n\n\nNot illegal, not murderer, not widowed, raped, destitute, fearful.\n\n\nIn Flushing, I had lived defensively in the midst of documented\nrectitude.\n\n\nI did not want to live legally if it also meant living like a\nrefugee. \n\n \n\n \"  give you  study,\"\n Wylie said.\n\n\n  \"  move his junk into the dining room.\n\n\n have your own room that way.\"   \n\n \n\n  \" Junk!\"  \n\n\nTaylor laughed.\n\n\n  \" Junk!\"  \n\n\nThe gap made him look sardonic.\n\n\nBack in his hockey-crazy town in upstate New York, \nlost a number of teeth and they were never replaced with bridgework, so the\nteeth he had left - - chipped teeth, crooked teeth - had drifted and settled\ndeep in his gums, leaving gaps between them.\n\n\nThe teeth seemed to mock whatever he said.\n\n\n  \" For you, Jasmine,  be homeless.\n\n\nFor you, Japanese research will widen the meson gap.\n\n\n have your room ready by next Sunday.\"  \n\n\n \n\n  \" Then where will Duff sleep?\"   \n\n \n\n  \" Her room, of course.\"   \n\n \n\n  \" Not with me?\"  \n\n\nI could not imagine a small child sleeping alone.\n\n\nI had trouble enough with it myself, never having spent a night\nalone until I got to Lillian  .\n\n\nThat was  pride: that she could give me  old room, by myself, not with the Kanjobal women.\n\n\nI would have preferred sleeping on a floor mat.\n\n\nIn Flushing I could at least hear the snoring of  Professorji\n and his father.\n\n\nI had lain awake in the Florida cottage, watching ghosts flit across\nthe ceiling, wrap themselves in the curtains, creak from room to room.\n\n\nWhen Kate had told me of a possible job looking after a child, I had\nimagined myself in a narrow bed with a baby, and the thought had brought me\ncomfort. \n\n \n\n \" Who will I sleep with?\"  I asked. \n\n \n\n \" What you do on your own time is your business,\"\n said Wylie.\n\n\n  \" But show discretion, for  sake.\n\n\nI hope you understand.\"   \n\n \n\n \" Let us check him out first, is what she means,\"\n said Taylor. \n\n \n\n \" Who?\"  I asked. \n\n \n\nKate came over.\n\n\n \" Can we start again?\"  she suggested.  \n\n \n\nOn Sunday  computer station was still by the\nwindow in the study, his racing bike hanging like art on the wall, and his\nwindjamming equipment in the closet.\n\n\n \" Give me a couple more days,\"  he said.\n\n\n  \"  another breakthrough in the lab.\"\n \n\n\nHe was out early, back late.\n\n\nI prayed he was not sorting hair.\n\n\nWylie put on a  face.\n\n\n been sleeping on a cot in his room, folding it up by\nday.\n\n\nAll my T-shirts and cords fitted into a plastic bag in the closet.\n\n\n \n\nThey thought I wanted a room of my own.\n\n\nI had no way of telling them it wasn't necessary, that I worried\nabout Duff all alone with her animal paintings and stuffed dolls.\n\n\nShe was a lovely child, easy to look after.\n\n\nShe was the only American, at the time, that I was capable of\ntotally understanding.\n\n\nFor her, I was a wise adult without an accent.\n\n\nFor me, she was an American friend whose language I understood\nand humor I could laugh at.\n\n\nAnd she laughed at mine.\n\n\nI did have a sense of humor. \n\n \n\nShe was a pale child with pale eyes and pale hair.\n\n\nWhen she raced ahead of me in Riverside Park and I pretended to\nchase her, it was like chasing a milkweed parachute or a feather.\n\n\nI was learning about the stores, the neighborhood, shopping, from\nher.  \n\n \n\nSleeping in  room was supposed to be temporary,\nbut she and I quickly fixed that.\n\n\nWe moved my cot in.\n\n\nI prayed  be allowed to stay.\n\n\nI planted the idea with her.\n\n\nTo Wylie I said,  \" I don't mind, really, \"  and\ncopied her look of a put-upon saint.  <*> star<*/><*>star<*/><*>star<*/>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d796c662-804b-46f7-b728-7e8d40f9b175", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.126837+00:00"}

Hogg Market, a landmark, was gutted in a yet unresolved mystery\nfire on December 12, 1985).\n\n\nThe snide remarks of Biman so enraged the mayor that he threatened to\nresign his post in the first week of February.\n\n\nJyoti Basu, however, persuaded him to stay on. \n\n \n\nThe raging intra-party feud can be traced to the market fire and\nthe subsequent reconstruction scheme.\n\n\nWithin a month of the incident, Calcuttans were aware that the\nMarxist city fathers and the then Marxist minister in charge of local\ngovernment and metropolitan development, Prasanta Sur who is now the health\nminister, were in undue hurry to entrust the reconstruction work to a few\nprivate promoters. \n\n \n\nNow, after five years, with a huge four-storeyed building having\ncome up, Biman Bose has ignited a political fire.\n\n\nAt a hurriedly convened press conference at the party\nheadquarters, Biman accused the civic authorities of violating contractual\nnorms while allotting space in the new block to stall owners affected by the\n1985 fire.\n\n\nHe claimed that he had himself received 22 charges of irregularities\nand cited two specific cases.\n\n\nOne of the fire-victims, who had a stall of 192 square feet, has been\nallotted 184 square feet in the new block, and that too by the side of a\npublic urinal.\n\n\nAnd in the second case a person who earlier had a stall of 144 square\nfeet has been given only 78 square feet. \n\n \n\nThough Biman did not name names the target of his attack\nobviously was Mayor Kamal Basu.\n\n\nThe  quick reaction, dubbing the charges as  \"\nbaseless\"  and  \" untruthful\"  , only exposed the\ninfighting. \n\n \n\nThe timing of  onslaught is significant: it came\nwhen party secretary and Left Front coordination committee chairman,\nSaroj Mukherji, was on his death-bed.\n\n\nApparently, the  'young turks'  led by Biman were\nraring to have a decisive say in party affairs hitherto run by Jyoti Basu\nthrough a titular head like Mukherji. \n\n \n\nThe New Market deal perhaps is the best example of alleged unholy\nnexus between the ruling clique and the promoters.\n\n\nThe civic authorities entrusted the rebuilding work to Martin Burn,\nknow being owned by developers K.N. Fatepuria and Associates.\n\n\nThe contract was that after accommodating the fire victims, the\npromoters would have the right to sell the rest of the space, paying the\ncorporation a premium of Rs 1,080 per square metre. \n\n \n\nAnd therein lay a prize catch: the original one-storeyed\nstructure now has four storeys.\n\n\nHence four times more space has been created on the same site.\n\n\nThe prevailing market price per square metre at New Market, according\nto a very conservative estimate, is between Rs 20,000 and Rs 30,000.\n\n\nBut then in this deal the corporation would get only Rs 104 \nlakh  while the promoters would raise anything between Rs 25\n crore  and Rs 32  crore  from the leases and\nthereby reap a profit of around Rs 25  crore  .\n\n\nThe cost of construction of the new block, according to a senior\nofficer of the building department of the corporation, would at the most\nbe Rs 250  lakh  .\n\n\nQuestions have been raised on this but to no avail.\n\n\nWhat Biman Bose and his group have realised is that the deal has\ntarnished the image of the CPI(M) and diminished its prospect of returning to\npower in the civic elections to be held in June. \n\n \n\nBut  latest move clearly indicates that the\nyoung turks are now hell-bent on weeding out the deadwood from all important\npublic positions.\n\n\nIncidentally, Biman Bose now enjoys an unassailable position and he\ncan dictate terms within the party forums especially because his personal\nbrigade includes such incorruptible stalwarts as Buddhadev Bhattacharya and\nAnil Biswas, who, like Bose, are members of the state party secretariat. \n\n \n\nNow with Saroj  passing, Biman and comrades\nmay be gearing themselves up to capture the party apparatus.\n\n\nThe die has been cast and a bitter power struggle between the old\nguard and the young turks is on. \n\n\n - - <@AS> TAPASH GANGULY {#}  \n\n\n\n\n US plan to boost economy \n\n\n Budget to spell crucial shift \n\n \n\n<@PR> WASHINGTON {#}, <@DR> Jan. 28 {#} ( <@SR> PTI {#}):\n- - US President Bush's 1200 billion dollar budget for fiscal 1991 (\nstarting October 1, 1990) to be presented to Congress formally Monday, is\nexpected to shift the US priority for the first time since World War II from\nfighting the cold war to competing on the economic front with West Germany\nand Japan. \n\n \n\nWithout mentioning these two emerging superpowers by name,\naccording to a summary of the budget documents published in advance in a\nsection of the press, Director of the White House office of management and\nbudget Richard G.

{"text": "a small, beautiful world of fun and fantasy -\n- the world of puppets.\n\n\nB.V.K. Sastry explored this stringed world at the International\nPuppetry Festival held in New Delhi last month.      \n\n\n   Harping on many strings        \n\n \n\n  THE   Indian International\nPuppetry Festival was held in New Delhi last month.\n\n\nIt threw open a    Lilliputian  \nworld of fun and fantasy.\n\n\nThe festival brought puppets and puppeteers from 28 countries round\nthe world, perhaps the first time so many countries gathered under one roof\nin India. \n\n \n\nOne could imagine the efforts that went into the gathering most of\nthem from distant lands with different cultures, traditions and political\nsystems. \n\n \n\nHere, man had a novel experience of looking at himself in a\nminiature form, articulating and expressing himself.\n\n\nWhile some actions seemed natural most of them struck as\nunrealistic, comical but entertaining.\n\n\nHe seemed to enjoy his representation in caricature. \n\n \n\nAnd reinforcing this experience were numerous other\ncharacters and figures who shared the stage with this miniature man.\n\n\nMost of them, of course, seemed to belong to a dream world or coming\nstraight out of the pages of a book of fairy tales. \n\n \n\nMost puppeteers followed the old technique of manipulation - -\nthrough strings, rods and fingers ( glove puppets) and projection.\n\n\nBut there were attempts at other techniques too. \n\n \n\nSome manipulators appeared on the stage along with their puppets\ndisplaying their skill, some seemed to become a part of the characters\nthemselves by donning masks, or holding on to the puppets from behind and\nguiding movements and so on.\n\n\nAnd some like the troupe from Vietnam chose water for\nperformances.\n\n\nAnd then there were shadow puppets whose projection was fantastic\nand colourful. \n\n \n\nNotwithstanding the diversity, one could also discern a common\nthread in concept, technique and purpose in puppetry.\n\n\nFor instance, the clown, or  Killekyata  , and\n Bangarakka  of Karnataka shadow puppets had their\ncounterparts in Judy and Punch of UK.\n\n\nAsian puppets maintain traditional forms while the Western ones take\na new direction. \n\n \n\n  THE   puppetry festival was\ndivided into three parts : Putul, an exhibition of puppets from different\ncountries; symposia on international trends in puppets, where nearly 40\nexperts took part; and, the performances. \n\n \n\nParticipating countries gave nearly 70 shows spread over a\nfortnight.\n\n\nIn view of its requirement the Vietnamese troupe performed in the\nswimming pool of a hotel. \n\n \n\nThe troupe provided sharp contrasts.\n\n\nOn one side were countries with age-old traditions like India, China\nand Japan, and on the other hand were countries where the art is only recent\n( Madagascar, for instance).\n\n\nThe art is being given a new orientation in places like France,\nChile and the Netherlands. \n\n \n\nThe Indian contingent consisted of string, shadow and rod\npuppets and also mixed ones.\n\n\nThe Rajasthani  Katputhli  , \nshadow puppets, and Suresh  attracted much attention. \n\n \n\nThe colour, action, buttressed by a bracy rhythm and racy\ndialogues and backed by rich music, endeared the  Katputhlis \n, especially when those legless marionettes executed all foot movements.\n\n\nThe same could be said of the Uzbekian rod puppets played from below\nbehind a curtain.\n\n\nIt unfolded an old fairy tale of the region - - a blacksmith\nwinning the hands of a princess helped by a kindly crow. \n\n \n\nThe  Yakshagana  puppets from coastal Karnataka\ndepicted the story of  Narakasura  with the impact of live\nperformance.\n\n\nThe Andhra shadow puppets came a close second. \n\n \n\nSri   Anura  puppet  group resembled Tamil  \nBommalattam  in form, costume and ornaments.\n\n\nThe masked dances evoked the regional atmosphere. \n\n \n\nWith the popular character Khargoz holding centrestage, the\nTurkish shadow puppets were closer to a cartoon move, while the Japanese\nKuruma Ningy was a class by himself.\n\n\nHe manipulated the kimono-clad puppet while unfolding the tragic\ntale of a peasant girl - - O Shichi, her love, death etc.\n\n\nThe effect was dramatic. \n\n \n\n  THE   Swiss Huber brothers - -\nMichael and Tobias - - performed in the open.\n\n\nTobias provided the background music while  Michael\nhandled the puppets and voices.\n\n\nThe show opened with a small hump like screen on stage on which tiny\npuppets flitted about.\n\n\nThen Michael came on with Knusi the dwarf playing a horn.\n\n\nThis signalled an almost circus show where a frog, snail, butterfly\nand a stone gained life. \n\n \n\nSimilar was the performance of the Canadian David Smith and two\nmembers - - his wife and son.\n\n\nThey presented the story of the  Little Red Riding Hood  ,\nwith good audience participation. \n\n \n\nZuzana Schmidovas performance of Czech puppets was suited\nmore for a school than a serious festival. \n\n \n\nIndonesia is famous for its age old Wayang Kulit.\n\n\nThis time its team chose Wayang Golek i.e., rod puppets.\n\n\nThe  dalang, tizor purbaya  sat with his\nassistants in full view of the audience.\n\n\nWhile the fluid strains of Rebab filled the background, he presented\na story where Ghatodgaja and Arjuna, rather their Indonesian versions,\nwere the main characters.\n\n\nBut introduction of an assorted set of figures drawn mostly from\npresent times, one of which also smoked and let off rings was incongruous.\n\n\nAnd their antics gave a touch of slapstick to a serious performance\nwhose period atmosphere itself was lost. \n\n \n\nChile and Mali fell into a class by themselves.\n\n\nThe puppeteers from Mali took part in the performance donning\nmasks and stamping along with their lifesize puppets to the spirited and\nsensual rhythm of drums. \n\n \n\nThe Guinol troupe from Chile led by Anna Maria Allendes presented\na fairy tale entitled   Las Dos Serpientes de la Tierra del Sur\n  from Easter Island.\n\n\nIt opened with a traditional dance before a small replica of the\nmegalithic statue of that island. \n\n \n\nDadi   Waking Dreams  was another\neffort of his Ishara troupe unveiling a sort of neutral area between the \n  conscious   and  \n subconscious   .\n\n\nHere the manipulator also functioned as a part of the puppet itself.\n\n\nThe experience was abstract.\n\n\nThe presence of the manipulators no doubt provided an\nopportunity to the audience to appreciate their method and skill, but\nit was also distracting.     \n\n \n\nThe element of mystery and fantasy which is the heart of the\nmatter of puppet art was diluted and even disappeared. \n\n \n\nIn this light, witnessing the   \nVietnamese   performance was a highly rewarding experience.\n\n\nIt is essentially a  art whose themes reflect folk\nlife and beliefs. \n\n \n\nA colourful pavilion had been erected at one end of the\nswimming pool.\n\n\nA screen covered the lower part down to the water level.\n\n\nBehind the screen stood the manipulators in chest-level water\ndirecting the actions of puppets performing in front at some distance.\n\n\nThe traditional  Chu Teu  , something like our\n Sootradhara  , bobbed up introducing the subjects.\n\n\nNext came a wide range of characters, men, birds, beasts, mythical\ncreatures like dragons, unicorns, splashing, swimming, fighting and thus\nenacting short themes.\n\n\nThe dragons spewing smoke and fire  freely sailed, splashed and twisted while beautiful\nbackground music made the effect more enchanting.\n\n\nThe water ballet was like a scene from the Arabian Nights. \n\n \n\n  AND   then there was the\nsymposium which covered puppetry as an educational medium, parallel\ntraditions and contemporary trends spread over six sessions. \n\n \n\nNearly 40 scholars, delegates and practitioners from different\ncountries participated.\n\n\nSome spoke extempore while others, especially from abroad, read\nprepared papers.\n\n\nIt was an interesting experience to hear sounds of several brands\nof English delivered with a variety of intonations and dictions.\n\n\nThe papers mostly concentrated on the history of the art and were\nfairly lengthy stretching time further in the translations.\n\n\nA few had also brought puppets to illustrate points.\n\n\nBut Prof. Percy Press of UK dispensed with this formality and allowed\nhis Punch and Judy to speak than speech-making himself. \n\n \n\nThese proceedings brought some problems universal to this art.\n\n\nFirst,  negative attitude which feels puppetry is\nonly for children, ignoring the other potentialities.\n\n\nSecond, even those involved in mass communication programmes neither\ndeigned to understand or avail the potentialities of puppetry.\n\n\nThird, the conditions of the practitioners of this timehonoured\nart.\n\n\nThey seem to occupy a low priority area in all countries. \n\n \n\nNeither society nor the state was evincing interest in\nsupporting these struggling practitioners to preserve an art of great\nantiquity and making it more functional and in tune with the needs of the\ntimes.  <*> filled small circle </*> \n\n\n Notwithstanding the diversity, one could discern a common\nthread in concept, technique and purpose in puppetry.\n\n\n Killekyata  and  Bangarakka  of\nKarnataka had their counterparts in Judy and Punch of UK.  \n\n \n\nBehind the screen stood the manupulators in chest-level water\ndirecting the puppets which were performing in front at some distance.\n\n\nThe characters - - men, birds, beasts, mythical creatures like\ndragons, unicorns - - came splashing, swimming, fighting and ppewing smoke\nand fire.\n\n\nThe Vietnamese water ballet was like a scene from the Arabian Nights.\n    \n\n\n\n  Puppets on a string    <*>\nline</*>\n\n\nby R. P. Gurpur <*> line</*>\n\n \n\n A   FESTIVAL  of\nperforming arts was held this July in Paris.\n\n\nOf the two groups that participated from India, one was a string\npuppet troupe from Belloor village in Nagamangala taluk ( Mandya ) , the\nother from Kalakshetra, Madras.\n\n\nBoth were to perform sequences from the   Ramayana \n in the  Yakshagana  style through string puppetry;\nsinging chorus to the beat of the drums and cymbals, while the performers\nplay from behind manipulating the strings. \n\n \n\nOnly the puppets are seen on the specially erected stage.\n\n\nBetween singing, the dialogues are mouthed by the performers to\nthe  \" acting\"  by the puppets.\n\n\nThe performers virtually enact the emotions from behind, all the\nwhile making the puppets  \" act\"  . \n\n \n\n Shri Bhuvaneshwari Sootrada Bombe Yakshagana Mela ( Shri\nBhuvaneshwari  string puppet folk theatre group) was constituted\nin the present form 15 years ago.\n\n\nThe principal performer, the main singer, director and the leader\nof the troupe, B.H. Puttashamachar, has been at it from his childhood. \n\n \n\nIt was a family tradition and vocation.\n\n\nSome of the important puppets he has are his  .\n\n\nHe also carves puppets from wood - - a local variety called \n ale mara   from which the famous Channapatna dolls too are\nmade. \n\n \n\nThe old ones act as a guide, he says.\n\n\nThe wood structure    is   held sacred.\n\n\nThe change to the present wood has given greater flexibility in\ncarving and the use of oil paints on the puppets make it glow under bright\nlights. \n\n \n\nBut their longevity may not be comparable to the older puppets\nwhich were more rugged and lasting but not very sophisticat ed by  standards.\n\n\nEven in the folk medium the waves of change do make impact and\ninevitably, often unconsciously and imperceptibly, changes take place.\n\n\nNot all changes however are for the better.\n\n\nColour schemes, dress and decorations have seen some improvement.\n\n\n \n\nWith understandable pride Puttashamachar points out that as\nmaster    craftsman   he was given the award\nin 1981 by Karnataka State  Janapada  ( Folk Arts) Akademi,\nfor the puppets he was creating.\n\n\nOf the total 40 to 50 puppets used by him in the troupe more than\nhalf were carved by him in recent years. \n\n \n\nOld puppets break or split, with constant use and time, and\noften repairs are not possible due to the dry state and brittleness of the\nwood used, says Achar. \n\n \n\nDecreasing interest and indifferent patronage had brought\nthis folk art to the verge of extinction.\n\n\nThere are about 20 to 25 different troupes in Karnataka with\nvarying degrees of luck and prosperity.\n\n\nSome are barely able to survive.\n\n\nOnly a few are successful.\n\n\nMany more are dormant and often run as amateur efforts. \n\n \n\n  FIFTEEN   years ago  troupe too had hit the bottom and was nearing closure.\n\n\nTimely help and encouragement from the Kannada Study Centre of\nMysore University and the Folk Arts Akademi gave it a new lease of life,\nAchar recalls. \n\n \n\nHe is particularly appreciative of Prof. G.S.  interest and encouragement.\n\n\nThat a soft spoken, mature and talented person like\nPuttashamachar should feel so profusely thankful for a grant  of \n Rs.  5,000 to hold on to the troupe may be an indication of\nhis humility.\n\n\nBut it is also a telling commentary on the society and so-called\nprotectors of traditional arts and handicrafts. \n\n \n\nA mere  Rs.  5,000 was all that they thought of\nfor helping a troupe which provides livelihood for 14 persons, not to speak\nof continuing with an activity which is a part of our cultural heritage.\n\n\nShould the traditional folk arts be reduced to such supplication?\n\n\n \n\nPuttashamachar has memories of a sponsored visit to Bombay.\n\n\nAt the end, someone was so enamoured by the puppets that he was\nasked to leave behind.\n\n\nWere they compensated adequately?\n\n\n response was silence. \n\n \n\n \" What can we do if elders and important people make\nsuch demands?\"  \n\n \n\n \" They should be grateful that they are given a chance\nto perform\"  seems to be the attitude of the  'upper class\nof promoters',  whose position of influence can make or mar many a\ncareer.\n\n\nThe      Apna Utsavs \nare a classic example of this.\n\n\nIncidentally the Belloor troupe had performed at the  Apna\nUtsav  in Delhi, where they seem to have caught the eye of some\nappreciative French heart, leading to the French connection. \n\n \n\nThe French went about their choice quite methodically.\n\n\nThe first screening was through a video film.\n\n\nBefore finally selecting, the concerned French persons came\ndown, went all the way to the village, saw a live performance and only then\nmade the final selection.\n\n\nEach of the performance would be of an  duration.\n\n\nIt is a highly abridged version of the entire   Ramayana\n  encapsulated into an hour-long play.\n\n\nOver the years, the performers had learnt to trim their all night\nperformance into a 3-hour play.\n\n\nBut reducing it to one hour might do little justice to their art and\nperformance.\n\n\nThey have to do it jet speed. \n\n \n\nThe colourful personalities and characters of Ravana,\nShoorpanakha, Khara Dooshana, Thrishira, Jatayu, Vali, Sugriva, Anjaneya,\netc., apart from the main characters of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana, have to be\ngiven scope to bring out the essence of   Ramayana \n .\n\n\nThe fights and battles, the mirage of the golden deer and many other\nalluring episodes would crowd the one hour narrative, Achar remarks. \n\n \n\n  NEARER   home the troupe,\nlike similar others, depends on the patronage of the people.\n\n\nDuring festivals and locally important functions like the\n  Jathre   , on important religious days like the\nGanesha festival, the troupe is invited to perform. \n\n \n\nThey travel by bus and train, wherever possible, and even\nbullock carts.\n\n\nBesides the travel fare and food, the payment for one  performance can be, and usually is,  Rs.  1,001.\n\n\nOccasionally, they are lucky to get two or three thousand \nrupees  .\n\n\nThe demand is seasonal and very much depends upon the success of\nagriculture in a season. \n\n \n\nSome of the performers have small holdings of agricultural land\nby which they supplement their income.\n\n\nBut to most it is an uncertain vocation.\n\n\nBy being brought to the public gaze on bigger platforms they hope\ntheir fortunes would change for the better due to such exposure and\npublicity. \n\n \n\nThe all pervading TV influence has affected puppet play too.\n\n\nWith rural areas increasingly coming under TV coverage, the\nstruggle for survival becomes even more fierce and increasingly an\nunequal battle.\n\n\nWith all that, Puttashamachar is not perturbed.\n\n\nHis son has already been trained by him and he is confident that\nthe family tradition would

{"text": "DISCUSSION  \n\n \n\nPrevention of pregnancy induced hypertension is an important\nclinical objective which requires both an ability to predict the high risk\npatients and an effective prophylactic therapy. \n\n \n\nMean Arterial Pressure values of more than 90 mm Hg. in the late\nsecond trimester are related to the subsequent development of PIH and\nidentify the high risk subjects. \n\n \n\nPrevious clinical trials have suggested that aspirin in the dose\nof 50 to 150 mg per day during the second and third trimester reduces the\nrisk of pregnancy induced hypertension and improves maternal and neonatal\noutcome. \n\n \n\nIn this study the effect of low dose aspirin on patients with\nMAP-2 more than 90 mm Hg. was studied, along with an equal number of control\ncases ( MAP-2 more than 90 mm Hg. but aspirin not started ) . \n\n \n\nBoth these groups were comparable with respect to age - incidence\nand parity of the patients.\n\n\nThere was an impressive reduction in development of pregnancy induced\nhypertension in aspirin group.\n\n\nThe occurrence rate of PIH in aspirin group was 26 % whereas it was 54\n% with control group.  \n\n \n\nLow dose aspirin significantly reduced the incidence of IUGR in\nthe neonates ( 20 % in contrast to 51 % in the control group ) . \n\n \n\nLow dose aspirin also increased the birth weight of new born ( 89\n% of babies with birth weight > 2kg. in study group against 69 % of babies\nwith birth weight > 2kg. in control group ) . \n\n \n\nIn our small study , we didn't come across a single case of\nhaemorrhagic disease of newborn because aspirin was stopped two weeks before\nthe expected date of delivery. \n\n \n\nWe recommended that mean Arterial Pressure of each pregnant\npatient should be calculated in the second trimester.\n\n\nThis can be easily determined by using blood pressure normogram\nmentioned previously. \n\n \n\nIf MAP-2 is found more than 90 mm Hg, Tablet ASA 50 mg can be\nstarted and it should be continued till completion of 38 wks. \n\n \n\nHowever development of PIH should be watched for. \n\n \n\nThis simple, low-cost treatment ( Tb ASA - - 50 mg costing 60\npaise per tab. ) can minimise the maternal and fetal complications due to\npregnancy induced hypertension and therefore holds a lot of promise.   \n\n\n\n\n DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nHypertension disorders of pregnancy is a heterogeneous collection\nof disease.\n\n\nPregnancy is a peculiar condition of stress and can affect blood\npressure.\n\n\nPIH is a commonest cause of maternal and foetal mortality.\n\n\nA simple clinical test that is mean arterial pressure in prediction\nof PIH is used. \n\n \n\nA study of 300 cases was done from June 91 to Oct. 92 at\nobstetric and Gynecology department, Dr. V.M. Medical College, Solapur.\n\n\nStudy includes primigravidae and multigravidae.\n\n\nAll cases under observation from 5th - 6th months of gestation to\ndelivery.\n\n\nAll cases had antenatal care with approximately more than 3 visits.\n\n\n \n\nIn our study, out of 300 total cases, 152 i.e. 50.66 % were\nprimigravidae, 50 were second gravidae that is 16.66 % and 98 were\nmultigravidae that is 32.66 %.\n\n\nAll patients were normotensive at the time of registration.\n\n\n61 % women were first registered at 20-24 weeks gestation.\n\n\nAll were registered during second trimester of pregnancy. \n\n \n\n51.66 % women were below 25 yrs of age and 17 % women were 30 yrs\nof age. \n\n \n\nOut of these 300 cases, 64.33 % were from urban area i.e. Solapur\nproper and 35.66 % were from rural area with regular antenatal check up. \n\n\n \n\nRegular antenatal check up was done in the form of weight, Blood\npressure, presence of pedal oedema, degree of anaemia, urine albumin and\nsugar, clinical physical examination.\n\n\nUltrasonography was done as a routine for all patients. \n\n \n\nThe average level of blood pressure was found to be 100 / 70mm\nHg. to 120 / 80 mmHg in 66 % of cases and more than 120 / 80 mmHg. But less\nthan 130 / 90 mm Hg in 34 % of cases. \n\n \n\nOut of these total 300 cases, 21 patients had pregnancy induced\nhypertension in previous pregnancy.\n\n\n19 cases i.e. 90.5 % were multigravidae and 9.5 % were primipara.\n\n\nIncreased incidence in multigravidae was probably due to advancing\nage and inherent tendency of body after 28 yrs. of age to latent\nhypertension. \n\n \n\nOut of 152 primigravidae, 91 cases had MAP during second\ntrimester more than or equal to 90mm Hg.\n\n\n64.73 % of  primigravidae developed PIH in\nthird trimester.\n\n\nHence with MAP-2 \u00f290mm Hg, the chance of development of PIH is 64.73%\nwhich is significant.\n\n\n6 primigravidae out of 6 with MAP-2 more than or equal to 105 mmHg\ndeveloped preeclampsia.\n\n\nHence MAP-2 \u00f2 105mm Hg is indicative of PIH.\n\n\nOnly 7.2% of women with MAP-2 less than 90mm Hg developed PIH in\nthird trimester which is not significant.\n\n\nPatients with MAP &gt; 90 mm Hg are considered as high risk cases.\n\n\nHence second trimester MAP is a predictor of future pre-eclampsia\nin primigravida.  \n\n \n\nOut of 50 second graidae, 18 cases had MAP during second\ntrimester more than or equal to 90mm Hg. \n\n \n\n22.22% of second gravidae developed pre-eclampsia in third\ntrimester.\n\n\nThis shows less incidence of pre-eclampsia in second gravida.\n\n\n2 cases out of 2, with MAP-2 more than or equal to 105mm of Hg had\ndeveloped pre-eclampsia.\n\n\nHence MAP-2 \u00f2 105mm Hg is indicative of pre-eclampsia.\n\n\nNone of the women with MAP-2 less than 90mm of Hg developed\npre-eclampsia.\n\n\nHence there is no role of mean arterial pressure in second gravida\nwith development of future pre-eclampsia.\n\n\nThis supports the Immunological theory of PIH, pre-eclampsia affects\nfirst pregnancy and immunizes subsequent pregnancies. \n\n \n\nOut of 98 multigravidae, 64 had MAP during second trimester more\nthan or equal to 90 mm Hg.\n\n\n32.81 % of cases developed pre-eclampsia in third trimester.\n\n\nThis shows more incidence of pre-eclampsia in multigravidae than\nsecond gravida.\n\n\n3 cases out of 3, with MAP-2 more than or equal to 105 mm of Hg had\ndeveloped pre-eclampsia.\n\n\n31 cases had MAP less than 90 mm Hg and 12.9% developed pre-eclampsia\nin third trimester trimester showing the relation of advancing age\nand development of PIH. \n\n \n\nIn our study, total incidence of development of pre-eclampsia in\nprimigravida was 64.59%. which is stastically highly significant\n( p &lt; 0.01) gavida was 30%. \n\n\nIn second which is stastically insignificant ( P &gt; 0.05 ) .  \n\n\n\n\n  REVIEW OF LITERATURE  \n\n \n\nThe incidence of infant and neonatal mortality varies directly\nwith the status of development and availability of newer facilities of\nobstetric and neonatal  < in can in >\n\n\nIn India neonatal mortality rate is still higher : 72.9 % in rural\nareas and 38.8 % in urban areas.\n\n\nThe combined urban and rural rate is 66.7 % ( Park 1991).\n\n\nThe main causes of mortality are infection and anoxia.\n\n\nIn western countries the major cause of death during this period is\nhyaline membrane disease due to vigorous oxygen therapy. \n\n \n\nOne of the first detailed study among the western literature on\nthe problem of still births and neonatal deaths was done by E.

{"text": "COVER STORY \n\n\n FLY BY WIRE, DIE BY FIRE      \n\n \n\nIndications that wondercraft A320, touted as Indian Airlines\nworkhorse for the nineties, is congenitally defective \n\n \n\nALL that was left intact of IC605 was its tail, a morbid symbol of\nthe way things are run in the domestic airliner, where things happen back\nto front.\n\n\nFor Indian Airlines, the much-abused epitome of delays and\ninefficiency, the February 14 crash in Bangalore of its proud new\nacquisition was another shattering blow to its safety record which anyway was\nnot high-flying. \n\n \n\nThe wreckage and the 90 deaths raised a big question mark over the\nfuture of the fleet of the ultra-sophisticated A320 aircraft from Airbus\nIndustrie of France and the safety standards in the IA.\n\n\nThe feeble protests over inadequate safety measures raised by its\nengineers during the schedule-crippling crisis of December-January have now\nassumed deafening proportions. \n\n \n\nAt the centre of the raging controversy is A320, a unique aircraft\nbecause of its nature to  'fly by wire'  .\n\n\nOne of the most fancied passenger carriers in the international\nmarket, A320 was being projected as the workhorse of the airlines in the\nnineties, even as it phased out the Boeing 737s and Airbus A300s.\n\n\nBut now the ominous question is whether this wondercraft has a\ncongenital defect which makes it disastrous to let loose on the Indian skies,\nand especially near Indian runways. \n\n \n\nThe muted whispers of fancy kickbacks ( the total Airbus deal is\nbigger than the Bofors deal) are now being openly aired, pointing an accusing\nfinger at the men who favoured Airbus to Boeing and other competitors.\n\n\nWith Union Civil Aviation Minister Arif Mohammed Khan already\nordering a complete review of the deal, the coming days should see a bitter\ncontroversy raging, with rivals of Airbus adding enough aviation fuel to the\nfire. \n\n \n\nClose on the heels of the debate over the choice of aircraft is\nthe issue of failure of the administration to conduct an integrated civil\naviation system - - landing and communication facilities and upgraded\ntraining - - along with the new aircraft. <call-out>\n\n\nWith the new Airbus under a cloud, the airline may not go ahead with\nthe second phase of acquiring 12 more A320s, each costing Rs 65 crore.\n</call-out>\n\n\n \" I am distressed that while hundreds of  crores\n    were   spent on the aircraft purchase,\nsimilar investment was not made to improve ground facilities,\" \nlamented Arif Khan at the crash site.\n\n\nBut now the buck stops with him - - he has to sanction funds. \n\n \n\nInitial investigations by P.C. Sen, director-general of civil\naviation, and his colleagues shortlisted two likely causes for  fatal plunge outside the high airport compound wall in east Bangalore -\na screw-up by the  sophisticated computer system or pilot\nerror.\n\n\nHowever investigators do not rule out poor landing facilities coupled\nwith control failure and even sabotage.\n\n\nBut the precise answer can come either from the cockpit voice\nrecorder or the digital flight data recorder, both of which were found\nintact.\n\n\n \" Till then all we speak will be educated guesswork,\"\n pointed out a senior official from Airbus Industrie who accompanied\nJean Paul de Villieneuve, accident investigator of the French transport\nministry.\n\n\nBut the Airbus men were upset by the general debunking of their prize\nproduct. \n\n \n\nSen himself refused to hazard a guess on the cause of the crash (\nsee interview on p.  44  ) , but widespread apprehensions have\nbeen expressed about the airworthiness of A320 not only within the country\nbut even in the west.\n\n\nThe Indian  choice of the engine for the aircraft\nhas been described as risky. \n\n \n\nBut the 139 men, women and children who boarded IC605 at the\nSanta Cruz airport in Bombay were not experts, nor could they afford to be\nfastidious.\n\n\nThey were at the mercy of a national monopoly which brooks no\ncompetition to its charter and which moves in its baffling wayward ways.\n\n\nLike thousands of air travellers in the country, they too had to put\nup with snags and delays.\n\n\nBut compared to the recent track record of the airline in maintaining\nits despatch efficiency, it had done rather well with IC605.\n\n\nIt was only slightly late and was a smooth flight till the last fatal\nminute.\n\n\nSeveral of the passengers were preparing to unclip their safety belts\nwhen tragedy triumphed. \n\n \n\nWhen Captain Gopujkar rogered out as 1258 hours to the radar\ncontrol, he was six miles away from Bangalore airport and in the final stages\nof preparing his craft to land.\n\n\nAfter sighting runway 09, he called the control tower for details of\nweather-wind pressure and moisture and for permission to make his visual\napproach landing.\n\n\nThe next two minutes, which will go down in aviation history,    hold   the key to one of the worst air disasters in\nIndia. \n\n \n\nAccording to sources in the control tower, the aircraft just\ndisappeared from the scene and  \" it was not where it should have\nbeen, on runway 09, after we last had communication with the pilot of the\ncraft\"  .\n\n\nThe control tower supervisor feared the worst when he saw billows\nof smoke outside the airport and his hand moved to the crash button almost\ninstinctively.\n\n\nThe alarm bells sprung the initially stunned ground stuff at the\nairport into action. \n\n \n\nAccording to sources at the airport, the aircraft disappeared\nwhen it was about 2,000 feet from the airport.\n\n\n \" After the captain announced that we were landing, we\nactually found that we were not landing in the airport but on a barren land,\"\n said Devidasan, a survivor.\n\n\nPerhaps even the captain was caught unawares when his craft dipped\nsuddenly without giving him a chance of regaining the required altitude\nfor a safe landing. \n\n \n\nCutting into some of the treetops and flying miraculously over\nsome brick-kilns in the vicinity of a new-created golf course, the Airbus\ncame down on its main wheels with a thud and momentarily went up for about 85\nfeet.\n\n\nThe second thud shook the craft violently as only the rear wheels hit\nthe ground.\n\n\nIt was only after rolling for about 185 feet that both the front and\nrear wheels were touching the ground.\n\n\nPerhaps it was at this point that the captain felt he could still\nsave the situation by lifting the craft once again, but, alas, he had too\nlittle time. \n\n \n\nThe A320 veered for a lift, but only managed to climb the\nembankment of the gulf course comprising a 10-foot mud  bund \n, shrubs and trees and a wire fence.\n\n\nThe right engine, sheared from the craft by the impact and fell into\na 12-foot-wide ditch on the other side of the golf course boundary. \n\n \n\nThe craft was said to be still speeding at over 200 km an hour.\n\n\nThe speed and weight of the craft took it across the ditch and a\n15-foot-wide  kuccha  road and into the \nChallaghatta  Tank adjacent to the airport wall.\n\n\nParts of the left engine, which had detached itself as the craft\nscythed through the road, fell into the tank.\n\n\nBut both the front and rear landing wheels were miraculously intact\nalthough not for long.\n\n\nThe front section of the craft caught fire after two short explosions\n  blew away the wheels.\n\n\nThe craft made another 150 feet on its belly before the entire\nmid-section too caught fire. \n\n \n\nAs they heard the first explosions, the air hostesses in the rear\nsection were on their feet.\n\n\nThey urged the passengers in the mid-sections to force open the\nemergency    exits   and save themselves by\njumping out.\n\n\nBut in the panic and confusion, many passengers tried to salvage\ntheir luggage instead of trying to force open the jammed door.\n\n\nFortunately, a helping hand had reached the spot - - Prem Kumar, a\ncommercial staffer of IA.\n\n\nHe was part of a tractor team which had raced to the compound wall\nfollowing the emergency signal from the tower.\n\n\nHe scaled the wall and rushed to help some of the passengers who were\nunable to run because of smoke and fright.\n\n\nHe then moved to the craft and along with another person, helped\nforce open the rear door.\n\n\n \" I helped about 10 to 15 persons, including a five-year-old\ngirl to jump to safety before I too had to run away when the raging fire\nspilled over even the 15-foot-high compound wall,\"  says Prem Kumar.\n\n\n \n\nMost of the passengers in the front had absolutely no chance of\nescape.\n\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, it was the cockpit which exploded\nfirst.\n\n\n \" The fire came from the front side,\"  said\nSreedharan who survived along with his three family members.\n\n\n \" With so many bodies fallen in the passage and in between\nthe seats, we could not have escaped but for the emergency exit\"  ,\nadded his wife, her fractured left hand is in sling. \n\n \n\nAccording to a technician who was clearing the debris with his\ncolleagues,  \" it was a miraculous survival for many because the rear\nfuel tank did not explode.\" \n\n\nAnd, of course, three of the surviving hostesses, Sadhana Pawar,\nSujaya and Neela Sawant, did a courageous job of saving many lives.\n\n\nThe four crew casualties were pilot S.S. Gopujkar, co-pilot Cyril A.\nFernandes, air hostesses Mary Chacko and Lakshmi Swamy. \n\n \n\nSome of the Japanese passengers claimed that their smoking\nhabit turned out to be a life-saver.\n\n\n  \" As smokers we were seated in the back of the craft.\n\n\nThus we were able to jump out,\"   said one of them.\n\n\nFor some others, flouting the safety requirement of fastening their\nseat belts because of familiarity with air travel turned out to be a\nblessing.\n\n\nAccording to the first fire tenders and relief team which reached the\ncrash spot, many women and children buckled to their seats were crying in\npanic as fire engulfed them.\n\n\nSome of the charred bodies were still in sitting position and a few\nof them even had infants in their arms.\n\n\nProminent among the passengers who where strapped to death in the\ninfernal plane was industrialist Ashok Birla, cousin of Aditya Birla.\n\n\nHis wife and daughter, too, perished. \n\n \n\nIt was a pathetic scene at the Victoria Hospital morgue.\n\n\n \" My daughter was wearing a blue  churidar  ,\nnot a black one,\"  was the cry of a distraught mother who refused to\nbelieve that her daughter, the occupant of seat 17 - - the label attached to\nthe charred body - - was dead.\n\n\nIt was extremely difficult for the relatives to identify their kin\namong the charred bodies kept on blocks of ice with the customary wreaths\nfrom the Indian Airlines.\n\n\nMany of the relatives had to make a poignant, at times wild guess\neither from the ornaments or the medical reports on the dentures. \n\n \n\nThe Bangalore airport is controlled by both the ministry of\ndefence production and the National Airport Authority ( NAA).\n\n\nThe NAA, though, has no say in air traffic control, radar guidance\nand maintenance of the runways.\n\n\nIt was this dual control of the airport which caused the erection of\na 15-foot-high stonewall around the airport for defence security purposes.\n\n\n \n\nAccording to A.C. John, controller of aerodrome, the NAA only\nmaintained runway lights, radio and navigation lights, an MF band transmitter\nwith a non-directional beacon, a very high omni-frequency range system (\nVHOR) for accurate positioning of the aircraft for landing and a\ndistance-measuring equipment.\n\n\nThe airport also has an automatic direction-finding equipment with a\nrange of 100 - 150 miles to track flights in the air.\n\n\nThe communications system manned by NAA has a range of nearly 1,000\nmiles. \n\n \n\nIn addition, there are the auto visual approach slope indicators\non both sides of the runway to help the pilot to gauge correct altitude and\nposition himself for a smooth landing.\n\n\nIf a  altitude is above safety level, the lights on\nthe runway turn white and if it is lower they turn red and the right level\nfor landing is indicated by green lights.\n\n\n \" This equipment was in perfect functioning order on that\nday,\"  said John. \n\n \n\nJohn admitted that there was no instrument landing system at\nthe Bangalore airport.\n\n\n  \" And even if it had existed, it would not have helped\nthe ill-fated IC605.\n\n\nAs the pilot, after making visual contact of runway 09, had\nindicated to the radar and the control tower that he would land on his own,\"\n  said John. \n\n \n\nIronically the HAL, which has extensive control over the airport\ncourtesy the ministry of defence production, is not obliged to give access to\nthe NAA on matters of air traffic control, radar guidance and maintenance of\nrunways.\n\n\nIts word is final in these matters.\n\n\nThe NAA operates as many as 22 flights   \nevery day   ( eight of them A320s) from the Bangalore airport, but\nthere are no figures of the flights operated by the defence ministry.\n\n\n \" At least three flights per hour, either on training or\ntesting, take off from this airport,\"  says an airport official.\n\n\nNational priority, coupled with scarcity of land for setting up\nanother aerodrome, seems to have stifled  cry for independent\ncontrol of the airport. \n\n \n\nIncidentally, the establishment at Begumpet, Hyderabad, for\ntraining Boeing and Airbus pilots has been rocked by incessant strife during\nthe last few years.\n\n\nThe installation of the simulators for both Airbus 300 and A320 in\nHyderabad was delayed as plans were cleared for setting up a similar training\ncentre near Delhi by former civil aviation minister Shivraj Patil.\n\n\nIt was only at the fag end of 1988 that the plans were reverted and\nthe Airbus simulators were sanctioned for the Hyderabad establishment.\n\n\nHowever, the A320 simulators are yet to be deployed although IA has\npressed 15 such craft into service in the last eight months. \n\n \n\nEven as all attention was riveted on the Bangalore disaster, the\ngrounding of another A320 in Hyderabad went almost unnoticed.\n\n\nThe Madras-bound IC968 failed to take off from Begumpet airport on\nthe evening of February 15.\n\n\nThe passengers had a narrow escape because the pilot, who noticed\na fire in the right engine at the point of take-off, taxied back to the\nairport.\n\n\nThe passengers were later sent to their destination on a Boeing\ntraining flight!\n\n\nThe A320, however, recovered from its  'snag'  to do\na morning run to Delhi the next day.\n\n\nThe authorities, keen to keep the A320 out of further controversy,\ndescribed the  'snag'  as  \" routine and normal under\nthe climatic conditions of Hyderabad.\"  . \n\n \n\nThe airline, which operates over 200 scheduled flights daily\nwith its fleet of 30 Boeings 737s, 14 A320s and 11 A300s, finds the increase\nin passenger traffic - - 11 per cent last year - - a tough proposition to\nhandle.\n\n\nIts efforts to lease aircraft from other airlines have met with\nlimited success.\n\n\nAfter four rounds of negotiations two years ago, IA managed to\npersuade the Russian carrier Aeroflot ( which has over 3,000 aircraft) to\nwet-lease two aircrafts, one a Tu-154 for medium distances and a Il-62 for\nlong international flights.\n\n\nBut only the Tu-154 was finally made available and the lease expired\nby March-end. \n\n \n\nWith the new Airbus fleet under a shadow, the airline may not go\nahead with the second phase of acquiring 12 more A320s.\n\n\nBut delays and disruption of schedules have a psychological\nimpact on the crew and other staff, which again can accentuate the  'human\nerror'  factor. \n\n \n\n \" As long as there is pressure for tickets which we are\nunable to meet, compromises will be struck to operate more and more flights,\"\n said a former commercial director of the airline who was in\nBangalore,  \" and each compromise means a step towards disaster.\"\n \n\n \n\nWhile the pressure is high to accelerate its customer service\nactivities rapidly by achieving a hundred per cent despatch schedule, the\nsafety factors are becoming mind-bogglingly complex.\n\n\nThe man who walked the tight rope getting the  flak\n from all sides was Managing Director R. Prasad.\n\n\nHis exit accepting moral responsibility does not mean that the\nnightmare has ended for the Indian Airlines.\n\n\nIt will be a long haul before the airline can fly with its nose up\nrather than the tail, as it did with IC605. \n\n\n - - <@AS> G.S.

{"text": "<*> oblique line above </*>\n\n\n HARTICULTURE  <*> oblique line below </*> \n\n\n  GARDEN PEA      \n\n \n\nIN LEH garden pea can be sown from the first week of May to mid\nJune in flat land.\n\n\nIn plains, it is sown in rabi season from the beginning of October to\nthe middle of November and from the middle of March to the end of May on the\nlower hills and a second crop is also sown in the autum.\n\n\nHowever, early maturing pea varieties may be sown from August and\nonward in lower hills. \n\n \n\nSixty to 80 kg seed should be sown in one hectare but varieties of\nsmall grain type should be sown at the rate of 100 to 120 kg per hectare.\n\n\nThe row to row and plant to plant distance should be kept 25-30 cm and\n2.5 cm, respectively.\n\n\nThe depth of sowing the seed varies from 2.5 to 5.00 cm according to\nsoil moisture.\n\n\nBut it is necessary to sow all seeds at the same depth.\n\n\nUneven germination of the seed results in wide variation in maturity\nof pea at harvest time. \n\n \n\n  SEED TREATMENT   : For better germination,\nespecially for the wrinkled varieties, soak the seed in water overnight.\n\n\nIn the new field where the pea crop has not been grown earlier the\ninoculation of Rhizobium sp. in the soils is recommended for better growth.\n\n\n \n\n  FERTILIZER:  \n\n\nDepending on the fertility of the soil the following manure and\nfertilizers should be incorporated in the soil per hectare: 15 to 20 metric\ntonns of thoroughly decomposed Farmyard Manure ( FYM), 20 to 50 kg of\nnitrogen in the form of ammonium sulphate, 30 to 80 kg of potash in the form\nof potassium sulphate and 50 to 60 kg of phosphorus in the form of single\nsuperphosphate.\n\n\nThe complete dose FYM may be thoroughly mixed up with the soil at the\ntime of field preparation, whereas the whole quantity of potash and\nphosphorus may be applied before sowing.\n\n\nHalf of the ammonium sulphate should be applied at the early growth\nperiod for stimulating early growth of peas and the other half just at\nflowering stage by top dressing. \n\n \n\n  VARIETIES:  \n\n\nThough various hybrid / composite / selection varieties have been\nmade by scientists but there are two main kinds of cultivated peas available,\n the large and smooth seeded peas and wrinkled\nseeded field peas.\n\n\nThe wrinkled seeded varieties are sweeter.\n\n\nThe variety UD-2, Arkel and Bonneville are found to have high\nyielding potentialities for Leh ( J & K) area. \n\n \n\n  INTERCULTURAL OPERATIONS:  \n\n\nPea also requires regular soil moisture but the frequency of\nirrigation is much less than other vegetable crops.\n\n\nFor, frequent irrigations often tend to increase vegetative growth at\nthe expense of pod formation.\n\n\nIf there is less moisture in the light soil, the crop should be\nirrigated immediately after sowing.\n\n\nIn heavy soils the sowing should be done when enough of soil moisture\nis available.\n\n\nThe annual rainfall in Leh-Ladakh area is very less, therefore, if\nthere is no rainfall during pod filling stage, the plants must be provided\nwith an irrigation.\n\n\nSince most of the cultivated land of Leh is sandy loam, no irrigation\nis necessary after 4-6 days interval but in heavy soil, irrigation should be\ndone after 8-10 days interval.\n\n\nHowever, it always depends upon the weather condition and rainfall.\n\n\nHoeing should be done to keep down weeds and provide good aeration\nfor proper development of the roots and beneficial nitrogen fixing bacteria.\n\n\n \n\n  HARVESTING:  \n\n\nGarden peas must be picked at the proper stage of maturity, because\nthey start loosing their quality rapidly after reaching the edible stage.\n\n\nAt this stage the pod turns dark to light green and the grains are\nwell filled up in the pod.\n\n\nThe quality of pea is tested by its tenderness and high sugar\ncontent.\n\n\nThe deterioration is hastened if the temperature is high at the time\nof harvesting.\n\n\nTherefore, the picking should be done either early in the morning or\nlate in the afternoon so that the quality may not go down due to the heat of\nnoon.\n\n\nPod may be picked up about 60 days, 75 days and 100 days after sowing\naccording to early, medium and late varieies.\n\n\nAt the time of picking, care should be taken not to tear or jerk the\nplants so that they may not be injured and get partially dried up or stop\nbearing pods.\n\n\nThree or four pickings are done during the season.\n\n\nAn interval of 7 to 10 days may be kept between the two pickings.\n\n\n \n\n  YIELD:  \n\n\nThe yield of green pod varies with the variation in agro-climatic\nconditions.\n\n\nHowever, it has been estimated that green pod yield per hectare in\nIndia on the whole is about 43 to 50 quintals.\n\n\nBut varieties UD-2, Arkel and Bonneville have yielded green pod in\nthe experimental field of Field Research Laboratory.\n\n\nLeh ( J & K) of DRDO 70, 80 and 85 quintals per hectare,\nrespectively. \n\n\n  PROTECT FROM ENEMIES  \n\n \n\n  Powdery mildew:  \n\n\nIn Leh, powdery mildew caused by fungus eraiphepolygoni is the main\ndisease which appears from the second week of August; it may be a little\nearlier or late depending upon rainfall.\n\n\nThe leaves producing faint, slightly discoloured spikes; from which\ngreyish white powdery spots spread over leaf, stem and pod.\n\n\nLater on, the leaves become yellow and die whereas fruits either do\nnot set or remain small.\n\n\nIt can be easily controlled by dusting the crop with fine sulphur at\nthe rate of 25 to 30 kg / ha at 10 to 15 days interval or by spraying sulfex\n( 0. 2% ) or Karathane ( 0.1 % ) twice at 15 days interval as long as\nsymptoms are present. \n\n \n\n  Fusarium wilt:  \n\n\nThis is also a fungal disease caused by Fusarium oxyoporum Pisi.\n\n\nThe infection gets in through the roots.\n\n\nThe leaves eventually turn yellow and curl downwards.\n\n\nThe pods do not fill properly.\n\n\nIn severe cases, no pod formation takes place and whole plant wilts\nand stem shrivels.\n\n\nFortunately, this disease is not generally found in Leh.\n\n\nHowever, the control measure is either to follow long rotation or to\nuse resistant varieties.\n\n\nThe seed treatment and drenching the plants with Brassical ( 0.2 % )\nhelp in controlling this disease. \n\n \n\n  Pod borer ( Helothis sp. ) : \n\n\nAmong pests, pod borer may sometime cause damage.\n\n\nThe young caterpillors first feed on the surface of the pod, bore\ninto them and feed on the seeds rendering the pods unfit for consumption.\n\n\nIt can be controlled by spraying of 0.1 % solution of Malathion or by\ndusting of 5 % BHC at 20 to 25 kg per hectare or by spraying of 0.2 % DDT\nsuspension at 670 to 900 litres per hectare.  <O>  15 <O>\n    \nFoodwise  \n\n\n  SAY   CHEESE!   \n\n \n\n CHEESE coated pizzas and\nlasagnes, cheesecakes with wine, burgers drooling out cheese <*> dotted\nline</*>\n\n\nWhat would life in the fast food lane BE like, if suddenly, all the\ncheese were to disappear from the world? \n\n \n\nCheesed out,  what!\n\n\nThere are at least 1,746 varieties of cheese known to us ( besides\nassorted others cropping up now and then ) .\n\n\nLargely processed from the milk of cow, sheep, goat or buffalo, some\nlocal varieties are also made from the milk of the yak, zebu, reindeer, mare,\nass, even camel!\n\n\nThe nutritional quality of cheese depends on the kind of milk used -\n- cow milk cheese is the most nourishing of all.\n\n\n( See box NUTRITION VALUE OF CHEESE ) \n\n\n  CHEESE DOWN THE AGES  \n\n \n\nAn ancient yarn has it that cheese was discovered accidentally -\n- when a traveller in a desert put milk in his primitive canteen ( made from\nthe stomach of one of his domesticated animals ) .\n\n\nAt night, while drinking the milk, he found instead a trickle of sour\ncurd.\n\n\nTearing open the bag, he found the milk had coagulated.\n\n\nPerhaps the continuous movement of his mount and the desert heat had\nseparated the curd and whey.\n\n\nAnd  how primitive cheese was discovered. \n\n \n\nThe Iraqis used cheese as part of their staple diet as far back\nas 7000 B. C.\n\n\nIt is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament too.\n\n\nNomads made cheese by storing surplus milk in suspended bags, which\nwould then curdle because of the  warm climate.\n\n\nAnd when these bags swayed on the animals during journeys, the acidic\ncurd would break down to produce curd and whey.\n\n\nWhen a handful of salt was added to preserve the curd, it became\ncheese - - a high protein food to supplement the meagre meat of nomads, who\nspread the art of making cheese. \n\n \n\nThe way we make   ` paneer'   (\ncottage cheese ) at home - - by squeezing lime into milk - - is a pantomime\nof what our ancestors did.\n\n\nThey would coagulate the milk, using rennets from the hare and kid (\nconsidered better than that from the lamb ) , milk from the fig tree branch,\nvinegar, the thistle flower, the seed of the bastard saffron and, even the\nextract of green pineapples! \n\n \n\nThe art of cheese making was traditionally handed down the\ngenerations by word of mouth.\n\n\nThe misunderstandings that followed from this, on occasion, led to\nnew varieties of cheese!\n\n\nWhich wasn't very difficult, considering there were as many milks to\nchoose from as rennets.\n\n\nAlso, diverse additives used during cheese making gave rise to newer\nkinds.\n\n\nThese varied from traditional herbs, spices and nuts to beer, wines\nand liqueurs! \n\n\n  CHEESING KINDS  \n\n \n\nCheese is basically of four types; Soft, semi-soft, firm and\nhard.\n\n\nThe first includes the unripened and fresh type of cheese that most\npeople know as cottage cheese, cream cheese, pot or ricotta.\n\n\nMore sophisticated soft types that ripen in a matter of days inlcude\nBrie, Camembert and the so-called double and triple creams.\n\n\nThese develop thin, downy white crusts and have tender, almost fluid,\ninsides.\n\n\nThe semi-soft cheeses are those ripened with bacteria and yeast, and\ninclude Brick, Munster, Liederkranz, Limburger and Port Salut.\n\n\nBlue-veined cheeses like Ruquefort and Gorgonzola also belong to this\ncategory.\n\n\nFirm cheeses include Cheddar, Cheshire, Lancashire, etc.\n\n\nCheddar, probably the best known cheese in the world, originated in\nCheddar ( England ) in 1500 A. D.!\n\n\nThis firm bodied cheese is, today, considered a cheaper source of\nhigh value protein - - it contains 25 per cent protein ( compared to the 20\nper cent in meat and eight per cent in bread ) . \n\n\n  CHEESY GOODNESS  \n\n \n\nThe cheese available in the market has all the goodness of milk\nin it and more.\n\n\nSo, people allergic to lactose ( in   milk ) can safely eat cheese, since most of the lactose is lost during\nthe processing ( unless, of course,  the very soft, fresh,\nunripened variety ) . \n\n \n\nCasein is the main protein in cheese.\n\n\nAmong the other nutrients, cheese contains appreciable amounts of\ncalcium and phosphorus, which help in bone and tooth formation. \n\n \n\nThis milk product also contains iron ( which helps your blood )\n, and all the vitamins ( except Vitamin C ) .  <*> star </*>\n\n \n\nCheese adds flavour to lentils and pulses.  <*> star </*>\n\n \n\nNever overcook cheese - - its delicate, exclusive flavour is\njust as easy to destroy as enhance!  <*> star </*>\n\n \n\nAlways use the full quantity of cheese mentioned in a recipe.\n <*> star </*>\n\n \n\nIndian recipes require a light  masala  base.\n\n\nWhile adding cheese to curries, lessen the ginger and garlic or any\nstrong flavours that interfere with the cheese taste.  <*> star </*>\n\n \n\nWhile baking, pre-heat the oven to the temperature specified.\n\n\nAlso while baking, grilling or pot cooking, always remember that\nstrong heat is not good for cheese.\n\n\nHowever, while frying, since the cheese is normally covered or\ncoated, it can withstand heat without getting spoilt.  <*> star </*>\n\n \n\nWhen a recipe specifically requires sliced cheese, thin slices\nare advisable because they melt more easily.\n\n\nConsider it cooked as soon as it melts.\n\n\nIn its grated form, cheese can melt, bubble and brown without\ntoughening!  <*> star </*>\n\n \n\nBroadly speaking, cheese goes well with most firm vegetables.\n\n\nOf the soft ones, aubergines ( brinjals) are the best. \n  * \n\n\nDefence Agricultural Research Laboratory, Almora ( U.P. )", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d9615749-90ed-4005-8f66-80c1498e0792", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.133535+00:00"}

{"text": "SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY    \n\n\n  The many uses of a laser beam      \n\n \n\nAbility to retrieve enormous amounts of information,\nshoot down hostile missiles and aircraft, propel satellites and spaceships,\ncut and heat-treat materials, or kill cancerous cells in the human body with\npinpoint accuracy, is the magic of laser technology that was once regarded as\n \" an invention in search of an application\"  .\n\n\nIt has now become an indispensable tool for science, technology,\nmedicine and defence. \n\n \n\nIn 1916, Albert Einstein predicted that electrons could be made to\nemit a special kind of light, but it was not until 1960 that Theodore Maiman,\nan engineer at Hughes Research Laboratories in the United States, made this\nvision come true.\n\n\nA flash tube was used to pump energy into a ruby rod to make it emit a\nbrilliant beam of red light of a kind never seen before. \n\n \n\nA conventional light bulb emits light consisting of a number of\ndifferent wavelengths, which stream out randomly.\n\n\nIn scientific terms it is incoherent.\n\n\nA laser emits coherent light of one wavelength, with the light waves\nsurging out in a tightly ordered array.\n\n\nLaser light can pack immense power and can travel long distances.\n\n\n \n\nThe term  \" laser\"  is an acronym for light\namplification by stimulated emission of radiation.\n\n\nThe  first practical impact was in the realm of\nexperimental scientific investigation, where it provided researchers a source\nof light that could not only identify types of atoms and molecules and\ninitiate chemical reactions but, in general, probe, measure, and modify the\nfundamental properties of matter.\n\n\nThereafter, the  remarkable properties were put to\nuse in industrial applications.\n\n\nThe first, and in some sense still the largest, application is\ncutting and heat-treating of materials whether the need is for large cuts\nin armour plate, using an extremely powerful carbon dioxide laser, or the\nprecise trim of an expensive piece of synthetic fibre cloth using a small,\nhand-held laser.\n\n\nThe cuts are made without damaging any nearby material. \n\n \n\nWhat is that makes laser light so exceptional?\n\n\nAlthough most people believe that laser light is more powerful than\nlight from other sources, this is decidedly not the case.\n\n\nWith the exception of very specialised industrial or military lasers,\nthe total light output power of virtually any laser is less than one-fifth\nthat of a 60-watt bulb, and the lasers used in communication, computers, and\nthe recording industry all emit less light energy than a small ornamental\nbulb. \n\n \n\nIf it is not total power of emission, what special properties of\nlaser light make it different from the light emitted from incandescent or\nfluorescent lights,  arcs, the sun, or even from fire?\n\n\nThere are a dozen or so highly technical differences, but most\ncommercial and industrial applications rely on the four fundamentally unique\nproperties of laser light: colour purity ( monochromaticity ) ,\ndirectionality, tightness of focus, and coherence. \n\n \n\n  Colour purity :  \n\n\nWhite light, for example light from the sun, is really a mixture of\nlight of different colours, each with a different wavelength.\n\n\nIn the portion of the light spectrum that we can see, the shortest\nwave-lengths appear blue; somewhat longer wavelengths appear green; and\nthose longer still yield yellow, orange, red, and deep red.\n\n\nSir Issac Newton demonstrated over 300 years ago that white light is\neasily broken up into its constituents by passing it through some device that\nbends the light proportional to its wavelength.\n\n\nMother Nature provides such a device in raindrops; sunlight passing\nthrough the drops is refracted into colours, yielding spectacular rainbows.\n\n\nSimilarly, when light  from a flashlight or\nlight bulb passes through a prism, it will split into colours, even if a\npiece of red glass is placed over the light source. \n\n \n\nIn contrast, light from a laser operating in the red spectrum\nwould pass through the prism without being split.\n\n\nThis is because the range of red colours in the laser is extremely\nnarrow; the output is highly colour pure.\n\n\nSo even though the total light energy from the flashlight may be\nlarger than from the laser, all of the  light power goes into\none extremely pure colour, while the power from the other sources is spread\nover a vast number of colours.\n\n\nMany industrial and research laser applications depend on colour\npurity. \n\n \n\n  Directionality :  \n\n\nWhen light is emitted from a light bulb, it has no preferred\ndirection; the radiation goes uniformly in all directions unless something\nspecial is done to capture and steer it along a specific path.\n\n\nSteering devices such as mirrors and lenses are common and form an\nintegral part of many of our everyday light sources.\n\n\nHowever, if the application calls for a beam of light going in one\nprecise direction, with little or no spread in angle, something quite\ndifferent is required. \n\n \n\n  Tightness of focus :  \n\n\nWhen focused down to a small spot by a lens,  spread\nincreases.\n\n\nSince laser light possesses the smallest product of angular spread\nand spot size of all light ( diffraction limited), it will have the least\npossible angular spread when focused to a tiny spot.\n\n\nThis property provides the laser with very precise focusing, allowing\nall of the laser power to be concentrated on only one spot on the material.\n\n\nIn general, light from visible lasers can be routinely focused to\nspot sizes on the order of .000127 centimetre, far smaller than light from\nany other source. \n\n \n\n  Coherence :  \n\n\nLight, regardless of its wavelength or colour, can be usefully\nimagined as a wave travelling through space, or any transparent medium like\nair or glass.\n\n\nThis wave has crests and valleys, much like ocean waves; two such\nwaves are said to be correlated if their respective crests and valleys bear\nsome relationship to each other, either in space of time. \n\n \n\nWhen a light source produces radiation that is not correlated in\nspace or time, it is said to be  \" incoherent\"  .\n\n\nThe best example of an incoherent radiator is the sun.\n\n\nThis is because the light coming from the sun at one instant is\nuncorrelated with the light emitted later, and the light at the top of the\nsun is uncorrelated with the light from the bottom of the sun.\n\n\nIn fact, unless great pains are taken, light from virtually all\nnon-laser sources is nearly totally incoherent. \n\n \n\nLaser light, however, can be easily made coherent in space and\ntime.\n\n\nThis property allows lasers to operate in a special mode in which the\noutput is no longer a steady beam of light, but rather a precise string of\nextremely short-duration pulses. \n\n \n\nLasers have revolutionised communications, computers, and\nentertainment.\n\n\nThe development of solid-state lasers capable of emitting light with\nlong wavelengths far into the red end of the spectrum ( so-called infrared )\nhas prompted parallel engineering efforts on glass fibre cables for\ntransmitting this light. \n\n \n\nThe benefits of  ability to retrieve enormous\namounts of information stored in a tiny silver platter called CD-ROM (\nCompact Disk - - Read Only Memory ) are many.\n\n\nWhat is more, the laser has the ability to record, with amazing speed\nand flawless accuracy, vast amounts of information onto discs within\ncomputers, or onto paper.\n\n\nMagazines and newspapers are now printed from computers using laser\nprinters.\n\n\nLaser printers use plain paper, eliminating expensive photographic\npaper, processing machines, chemicals, maintenance and labour.\n\n\nThey cost less than other technologies. \n\n \n\nAs important as they are, these applications pale in significance\nwhen compared to  potential medical uses.\n\n\nLasers were first used in eye surgery, the \ntransparency making it a logical first subject.\n\n\nEven now, most innovations in the use of lasers occur in\nopthalmology.\n\n\nThe blue light from an argon light is being used to seal a hole in\nthe retina, to treat glaucoma - - potentially a blinding condition - - by\ncutting a hole to let excess fluid escape and to preserve sight in persons\nwith diabetic retinopathy by destroying the abnormal blood vessels caused by\nthe disease. \n\n \n\nThe eye laser developed in the US was first used in India where\nmillions of people suffer from cataract.\n\n\nThe instrument detects whether a  retina is\nobstructed by a cataract or is no longer functioning.\n\n\nLasers also see through cataracts to a determine whether surgery can\nrestore a  eyesight. \n\n \n\nLasers are also being used successfully to remove kidney stones\nfrom the lower ureter, the tube leading from the kidney to the bladder.\n\n\nTraditionally, this operation involves a large incision in the  side and hospitalisation of upto two weeks.\n\n\nNow with the use of a laser the stones are literally chipped to\npieces and patients are benefiting from shorter hospital stays. \n\n \n\nSimilarly, gallstones are exposed to lasers through an optical\nfibre passed through one channel of rigid endoscope.\n\n\nA second channel contains a relay lens system for viewing and a third\nchannel transports a saline    \nsolution purge that crushes the stones in the gall-bladder. \n\n \n\nThe high-energy beam of light can be used for cutting, sealing\nand closing blood vessels.\n\n\nLasers can be used to replace stitches in many kinds of surgery.\n\n\nThe beams can fuse the protein of the tissues and, when the wound\nheals, the body can absorb the coagulated tissue replacing a new protein and\npreventing scars on the body. \n\n \n\nLaser techniques can work much faster than tranditional suturing,\nthereby reducing the risk of infection while healing.\n\n\nIt achieves its cutting power by focusing light.\n\n\nA beam of only a new watts can be made to cut an enormous amount by\nfocusing on a spot smaller than the diameter of a human hair. \n\n \n\nLaser technology has not only made surgery a gentler process, it\nalso costs less and saves time.\n\n\nIt has succeeded in its goal of cutting down hospitalisation and has,\nin fact, entirely taken some procedures out of the hospital.\n\n\nLaser technology lessens the trauma of traditional surgery and is\ngood because it is gentle, precise and can work into a deep hole without\nhaving to disrupt a lot of overlying tissues.\n\n\nUnlike in conventional surgery, the surgeon can sight along the beam\nof light at the target tissue and does not have to struggle to look around\nfor the instrument. \n\n \n\nThe laser has also demonstrated itself as an awesomely potent\nweapon of destruction recently during the Gulf War.\n\n\nMissiles were tracked, identified and ultimately destroyed with the\ncoherence of laser light.\n\n\nIt is the source of a vast number of new technologies as well.\n\n\nThis technology has been thoroughly integrated into everyday life and\nit has developed into a tool so ubiquitous it would be hard to imagine life\nin the high-tech world without it.  <*>

{"text": "COMPUTERS & ELECTRONICS \n\n\n   NEXT ?  \n \n\n\n\n VENKAT KRISHNAN  <&> \n\n\n A revolutionary new computer  system NeXT,\ncombines a number  of recent technological \nbreakthroughs  \n\n \n\n  EVER   since Steven Jobs,\ndesigner of the Apple Macintosh personal computer was forced out of Apple\nComputers Inc., there were rumours that he was on to something big.\n\n\nSoon he was working on a new machine designed to bring the power of\nminicomputers and mainframes on to the desktop. \n\n \n\nHe had previously brought out Macintosh and so demonstrated\nthat a computer need not be difficult to operate nor involve learning endless\nsets of commands and syntax.\n\n\nThe  user interface introduced the idea of\npull-down menus.\n\n\nIn this new approach, functions are arranged in a set of ` menus' and\nall that a user need to do is  ` pull down'  a particular menu\nand choose the command that was to be executed.\n\n\nThe arrival of the  ` mouse'  a handy sliding desktop\ncontroller which eliminated the need for     moving the cursor\nwith arrow keys, was yet another mile-stone. \n\n \n\nMacintosh brought a totally different concept into desktop\ncomputing.\n\n\nFrom then on, all software developers focussed on making their\npackages as user-friendly as possible and many used screens that imitated\nthe Mac. \n\n \n\nThe long-awaited system, the NeXT ( pronounced  ` next'\n ) , was unveiled in San Francisco in October 1988.\n\n\nThe information impact of NeXT was administered in one big punch,\ninstead of feeding several incomplete scraps of information in a manner\nsimilar to that used in packages like dBASE IV and Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3,\netc. \n\n \n\nThe main unit of the NeXT computer is a black-coloured 30 cm\ncube with a single power cable for connection to the mains.\n\n\nPower is supplied to the monitor, keyboard and    <O> caption </O. \n\n  other devices outside the cube through\na cable connecting the main unit to the monitor.\n\n\nThe keyboard is connected to a socket in the mionitor unit ( and not\nto the main machine as is the case in other desktop machines ) .\n\n\nThe monitor unit has speaker sockets for stereo output and a\nmicrophone socket, while the mouse is connected to the keyboard. \n\n \n\nThe system is built around a Motorola 32-bit microprocessor\n68030 ( operating at 25 M Hz, a performance figure of 5 MIPS or million\ninstructions per second) supported by a 68882 math co-processor.\n\n\nThere is also a 56001 digital signal processor which NeXT uses to\nsynthesize high-quality stereo sound.\n\n\nThe high speed of the main processor gives NeXT the capability to\ngenerate highly realistic animated three-dimensional simulations.\n\n\nThe random access memory ( RAM) that comes along with the system\nis a whooping 7 megabytes ( MB).\n\n\nThis can be increased to 16 MB if needed.\n\n\nThere is also a version with only 4 MB memory for those who think 8\nMB is too much, in comparison, the standard IBM PC has a memory size of\n256 Kilobytes ( KB) expandable up to 512 KB.\n\n\nAt present, the monitor is an ultra-high-resolution monochrome\nmonitor.\n\n\n( A point which many critics noted since colour graphics would have\nbeen ideal.\n\n\nBut that was a compromise required in design. )\n\n\nThe monitor can be easily tilted forwards or backwards and it has\ntractor-style wheels at its base so that it can be moved across a table. \n\n \n\nIn any computer system, the raw speed of the central processing\nunit ( CPU ) is not sufficient to increase the speed of program execution\nwhich ultimately decides the through-put of the system.\n\n\nThe CPU, could get bogged down by slow peripherals and may have to\nwait to service many input / output ( I/O ) cells.\n\n\nDesigners have long since recognized this difficulty and tried to\noff-load all such activities to other indpendent processors.\n\n\nFor example, when the first 8-bit microprocessor was introduced,\nthere were peripheral chips which handled memory, I/O as well as clock /\ntimer functiions all in one.\n\n\nFrom then onwards designers began to distribute the total work and\nemploy specific peripheral chips for each function.\n\n\nThat lead to the development of the I/O controller, bus controller,\nclock, interrupt controller, etc.\n\n\nEach was a separate chip doing only what it was best equipped for.\n\n\nThe initial microprocessor 8085 had four hardware interrupt lines,\nthough later generation ( 8086 / 8088s ) had only one.\n\n\nThe idea was to allocate that work to a different chip.\n\n\nNeXT takes this design ideology to its logical conclusion by\nhaving a number of specialist chips for handling peripherals. \n\n \n\nIn most computer systems, the digital signal processor ( DSP)\nis used primarily for speech synthesis.\n\n\nHowever, its design is such that it can be useful in a number of\napplications like voice recognition, image processing, filtering of\ndigital data, mathematical operations, etc.\n\n\nThe DSP works with 24-bit data and can be programmed for any specific\napplication.\n\n\nFor example, it can be programmed to function as a 10-band graphic\nequalizer for a digital stereosystem.\n\n\nDuring the unveiling function of NeXT the sound synthesizer was used\nto generate a thunderstorm and Martin Luther  speech entitled\n ` I have a dream'  , with excellent effects. \n\n \n\nMass storage devices are products of the latest technology.\n\n\nEver since the arrival of CD-ROM ( compact disc read only memory - -\nsee box ) , attempts were being made to design      an optical\nor magneto-optical system which can write as well as read.\n\n\nThis was of great interest to computer manufacturers since the\ndata storage in optical disks was exceedingly high - - of the order of\nhundred of megabytes.\n\n\nThe hitch with CD-ROM was that it can only be read - - like an LP\nrecord - - but cannot be used to write any data.\n\n\nThe data had to be programmed earlier at the manufacturing point of\nthe disk.\n\n\nNeXT uses the first commercially available erasable optical disk (\nfrom Canon).\n\n\nIt comes with an erasable optical disk drive of 256 MB data storage\ncapacity.\n\n\nCompare this with the standard 360 KB floppy disks or even the 20 MB\nhard disk which comes with an IBM PC-XT and to get some idea of the amount of\ndata that can be stored in a single disk.\n\n\nMoreover, the 256 MB ` floppies' can be removed and carried around,\njust like conventional floppy disks.\n\n\nThey are not very big either - - only slightly bigger than 8.75 cm (\n3 1/2-inch ) floppy disks and can contain as much data as that contained in\nover 700 ordinary 360 KB floppies. \n\n \n\nAlso available as extras are 330 MB and 660 MB conventional\nhard disks which will give a better speed of data access.\n\n\nBecause of the high-capacity optical disks, the entire Unix\noperating system along with applications and utilities ( with lots of space\nstill left for adding other data), becomes portable.\n\n\nThe machine does not have any floppy disk drives, which makes one\nwonder whether all the software to be developed for NeXT will have to be\non the optical disk.\n\n\nThe usual packages would definitely not require 256 MB of space. \n\n \n\nThe display screen ( or the monitor ) gives crisp graphics\nbecause of the 1,120 by 832 pixel display that NeXT uses.\n\n\n( Pixels are picture elements, the number of dots that make a\npicture. )\n\n\nThe NeXT display is made up of 1,120 dots lengthwise and 832\nheightwise.\n\n\nIn contrast, the standard IBM PC graphics screen gives 320 by 200 in\nthe colour graphics mode and 640 by 200 in the high resolution mode.\n\n\n( Incidentally, all the comparisons being done with IBM PC  are only for the purpose of understanding.\n\n\nNeXT is not comparable with a personal computer - - it belongs to a\ntotally different class of machines.) \n\n \n\n capability to handle stereo sound will be useful\nin voice mail.\n\n\nLike its electronic counterpart, users of voice mail can leave\nmessages by speaking into a microphone while the computer stores them in\ndigital form.\n\n\nMessages can be addressed to a particular person in a network who\nwill be able to retrieve them.\n\n\nThe message will be  ` heard'  by the receiver (\nprovided, of course, he or she has a machine with similar capability.\n\n\nApart from this, NeXT supports networking and built-in Ethernet\ninterface. \n\n \n\nNeXT has its own graphical-user interface.\n\n\nThe general design is on the lines of the Apple Macintosh interface (\nsee photograph ) , though the screens are not duplications of the Mac\nscreens.\n\n\nThe operating system is Unix - - but with an easy-to-use interface so\nthat the laborious Unix commands are not an annoyance to the user.\n\n\nNeXT uses the Mach kernel with some enhancements.\n\n\nMach kernel was developed by Carnegie-Mellon University, and is\ncompatible with the well-known Berkeley Standard Edition Version 4.3.\n\n\nThe user interface is called the Workspace Manager and through\nthis most of the Unix commands can be issued for file management,\ncommunication, accessing peripherals, etc. \n\n \n\nAnother important aspect is the development environment\noffered by NeXT.\n\n\nMany reviewers are quite impressed by it though big software houses\nare yet to declare any serious plans to develop software for NeXT.\n\n\nBill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, reportedly said that he was\ndisappointed with the new machine because most of the new features it\nboasts of are trivial.\n\n\nGates has reason to be unhappy.\n\n\nBecause IBM has decided to use  user interface,  OS/2-Presentation Manager was under threat.\n\n\nIf IBM finds that OS/2-Presentation Manager combine is too slow to\ntake off, there is a possibility that they may come out with a NeXT-type\noperating system as an alternative to MS-DOS.\n\n\nOn the other hand, many others have gone too far saying that NeXT is\nthe ultimate dream power machine for the developer.\n\n\nOnly time can tell who is right.\n\n\n Display Postscript, a screen display standard from\nAdobe is another important step forward.\n\n\nIdeally, this offers the possibility of developing\nmachine-independent screen displays.\n\n\nPostscript is the well-known page description standard for laser\nprinters.\n\n\nDisplay Postscript is an adaptation for graphic displays.\n\n\nIBM has decided to use this as standard software in its own version\nof the Unix operating system workstations - - the AIX system.\n\n\nThis is a significant move since software developers will now be\nencouraged to produce packages for IBM which will also run on NeXT.\n\n\nThus, NeXT gets over the problem that Macintosh faced during its\nearly days - - that of producing software for a product which has no\ncompatibles around. \n\n \n\nOther development tools offered by NeXT are futuristic.\n\n\nObject-oriented programming ( OOP), which is expected to gain\nimportance in near future, finds a place in NeXT.\n\n\n C-language compiler, Objective-C, supports OOP.\n\n\nAlso available is a standard library called Application Toolkit,\nwhich contains all the usually needed functions.\n\n\nA program called interface Builder is provided in the machine, in\norder to interactively develop user interfaces.\n\n\nApart from these, there are programs for working with sound and\nmusic.\n\n\nNeXT will also provide word-processing and other packages with the\nmachine.\n\n\nThe company also hopes to provide text books, reference materials,\ndictionaries and literary works in disk-form ( along with software to help\nlocate what is needed ) , to educational institutions, by utilizing its\n256 MB magneto-optical disc capacity. \n\n \n\n current marketing plans are restricted to\npromoting the machine in the educational-academic market, which though\nlimited could prove to be significant on a long-term basis.\n\n\nSome observers feel that funds required to develop an extensive\nmarketing network could be the reason why NeXT has ignored other markets.\n\n\nAs quantities increase, the machine should be available to another\nsegments as well. \n\n \n\nAll things considered, NeXT was planned with an eye on the\nfuture.\n\n\nWhether it will become a success story is debatable since this\ndepends on various other factors.\n\n\nHowever, the present strategy of aiming at the educational\nmarket, was devised to-ensure that it captures enough attention in future.\n <logo>  <box> \n\n\n CD-ROMS ARE ERASABLE OPTICAL DISKS </BOLD> \n CD-ROMs   or compact disc read only memories are\na result of developments in consumer electronics rather than in the\ncomputer industry.\n\n\nthe search for super hi-fi sound led to the idea of digitally\nrecording sound - - a process that is very similar to digital recording of\nvideo images.\n\n\nSony of Japan and Philips of the Netherlands jointly developed a\nproduct that produced high-fidelity sounds.\n\n\nThe compact disc ( CD ) player was intended to be some kind of\nultimate experience for music bulls.\n\n<P> \n\nsound is recorded on CDs in a digital format rather than the\nanalogue format usually used in tapes and records.\n\n\nTo do this, alalogue sound is scanned ( or sampled ) , converted\ninto digital figures and then recorded in the CD.\n\n\n( This means that the contents pf a CD can be interpreted as a\nseries of 1s and 0s. ) A laser beam pics up the signals, convers them into an\nanalogue format and plays them back. <3> Ithis process, noise, hiss and\nother annoying effects are almost totally eliminated.\n\n\nMoreover, the microprocessor in the CD even rebuilds music lost due\nto scrathes and dust on the disc.\n\n \n\nThe kind of data integrity offer by CD immediately drew the\nattention of computer manufacturers.\n\n\nSoon, a version of the CD player which could be interfaced to\ncomputer, because available.\n\n\nThe vast amounts of data that can be stored on a silngle palm-sized\nCD runs into hundreds of MBs.\n\n\nHowever, one major restriction is that the CD cannot record, because\nof the nature of its design.\n\n\nHence CDs are ideal for storage of reference materials loke\ndictionaries and databases.\n\n \n\nBut development did not stop there.\n\n\nResearchers continued to look for ways erasable magnato-optical\ndiscs make it possible to erase and rewrite on the disc.\n\n\nThe tecnicque used, however, is partly magnetic and purely optical.\n</box>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e827fc31-93eb-43bc-9c95-fcf43a78d0bc", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.136570+00:00"}
{"text": "Fear Of The Polls  \n\n \n\nThe extent to which an apathetic attitude towards democratic\ninstitutions has permeated  body politic has again become\nevident from the recent decision to put off the local body elections.\n\n\nThis is the fourth time that they have been postponed even after both\nthe ruling Congress and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party had loudly\nproclaimed that they were keen to see grassroots democracy flourish in\naccordance with the new law that allows reservation for all the weaker\nsections, including women.\n\n\nAlthough the government has said that it was merely re-scheduling\nthe polls as the current  \" unprecedented floods\"  would not\npermit the villagers in remote areas to exercise their voting rights, the\nreal reason for the BJP agreeing to the proposal to postpone the elections\nlay elsewhere.\n\n\nIf the divided Congress is unsure of the outcome, the BJP, which had\nearlier campaigned against such postponements and once even went to the court\non this issue, now finds itself on somewhat uncertain ground since its temple\ncard has not yielded the expected political dividends in the assembly\nelections and by-elections held elsewhere.\n\n\nGujarat is among the few states in India where local body polls have\nbeen held more or less regularly and, despite the fact that the village and\ntaluka-level  panchayats  continue to be dominated by the\nupper castes, the rural institutions have played a major role in giving a\nplace in the power structure to people belonging to the lower and\nintermediate castes.\n\n\nIt was hoped, therefore, that with the proposed reservations for the\nbackward castes and the women coming into effect, the  panchayati raj\n system would get a shot in the arm and help to empower the weaker\nsections in a more effective manner. \n\n \n\nThe postponement, however, only goes to show that if a powerful\nsection of the Congress, owing allegiance to Chimanbhai Patel, has failed to\ncome to terms with the new leadership, the BJP, too, is not too confident\nabout its future prospects.\n\n\nHaving entered into an alliance with the powerful landed gentry, known\nin Gujarat as the Patel lobby, the BJP could successfully enter the civic and\n panchayat  bodies in the 1986-87 polls, held in the wake of\nthe worst-ever caste war that led to the ouster of the Madhavsinh Solanki\nministry.\n\n\nNow, with the Ram card receding into the background, however, and no\nfresh issues at hand that can enthuse its traditional urban upper caste\nsupporters, there is a feeling in the BJP that a set-back in the local\nbody polls can have a demoralising effect on the party cadres during the\ncampaign for the assembly elections next year.\n\n\nIndeed, the postponement decision shows how little the political\nparties care about the democratic aspirations of the ordinary people.\n\n\nBecause of the postponement, the municipal corporation in Ahmedabad,\nBaroda, Surat, Rajkot and Bhavnagar will be ruled by bureaucrats for 18 long\nmonths for the first time in  history.  <*> a dark line\nin the middle </*>\n\n\n  France In Rwanda  \n\n \n\n intervention in Rwanda comes at a time when the\ninternational community is conspicuous by its absence in a country where a\nbrutal civil war has claimed more than half a million lives since April.\n\n\nBut instead of winning general applause, the French decision is\nbeing viewed askance not just in Rwanda but also in the Organisation of\nAfrican Unity countries and by most of  European allies.\n\n\nThe strongest opposition has come from the Rwandan Patriotic Front (\nRPF), led by the minority Tutsis, the victims of attacks by the Hutus.\n\n\nThe RPF sees the intervention as a calculated move by the French to\nbolster the Hutu government at a time when the RPF appears to be gaining the\nupper hand.\n\n\nEven though France has billed its Operation Turquoise as a strictly\nhumanitarian response to the carnage, with specific and limited objectives,\nit faces a credibility problem, given its record of political and military\nsupport to the Hutu regime of the assassinated President, Juvenal\nHabyarimana.\n\n\nAmong its European allies,  move is seen as an\nattempt to score a point over Belgium, a former colonial power in Rwanda,\nwhich has refused to get involved.\n\n\nThe French initiative can also have the effect of shoring up other\ndiscredited regimes in Africa, notably President  in Zaire.\n\n\n \n\nIf  hands are none too clean, nor are those of\n former colonial masters.\n\n\nIn fact, the origins of  savagery in Rwanda can be\ntraced back to the attempts of its European rulers, Germany and Belgium, to\nimpose antagonistic ethnic identities on communities that spoke the same\nlanguage and shared the same territory.\n\n\nThe minority Tutsis were bestowed with a superior racial status and\nthe majority Hutus consigned to a life of poverty and denied political and\neducational opportunities.\n\n\nAt the time of independence in 1959, the Belgians helped to turn the\ntide in the popular uprising and installed a Hutu government.\n\n\nThe conflict between the Hutus and Tutsis is therefore essentially a\npolitical one.\n\n\nIt is a measure of the failure of the western world, especially the\nU.N., that it has viewed the tragedy in Rwanda as an ethnic war and, wary of\ngetting embroiled in a Somalia-type quagmire, desisted from even minimal\nintervention.\n\n\nTo that extent, France has reason to congratulate itself for\nembarking on a thankless and dangerous mission.\n\n\nBut unless western and African intermediaries make a renewed effort\ntoward political reconciliation between the Hutus and Tutsis, French\nintervention is unlikely to bring about an end to  trauma.\n <*> a dark line in the middle </*>\n\n\n  The Bottom Line  \n\n \n\nAutobiography, said the writer Philip Guedella,  \" is at\nbottom an unrivalled vehicle for telling the truth - - about other people\"\n .\n\n\nBut publishers say that the bottom has fallen out of the memoirs and\nbiography market, with everyone wanting to get into the act, and readers\nending up confused with six different  \" authentic, first-hand,\neye-witness accounts\"  of the same event.\n\n\nSince scandal-power and controversy help sales, the former Australian\nprime minister, Mr Bob Hawke, known as the  \" Mouth\"  for his\nrich repertoire of somewhat unparliamentary words and profane adjectives, is\nthe answer to the prayers of publishers.\n\n\nIn his forthcoming autobiography, Mr Hawke, whom many thought of\nas a backnumber in the political outbacks, has revealed that his successor,\nLabour Party colleague and prime minister, Mr Paul Keathing, once described\nAustralia to him as  \" the arseend of the world\"  .\n\n\nWags might say the  \" bum rap\"  is nothing new in the\nantipodes, where even the original inhabitants once exposed their \nderrieres  to visiting royalty, as a symbol of their protest against\nofficial policy.\n\n\nMr Hawke, getting to the bottom of it, said the present Prime\nMinister used the expression four years ago when Mr Paul Keating threatened\nhe would migrate to Europe, bag and baggage, unless Mr Hawke yielded to him\n \" his turn as majority Labour Party leader and \nPrime Minister\"  .\n\n\nSources close to Mr Hawke also charge that Prime Minister Keating\ndenigrated the people  \" down under\"  as  \" lingering\nstereotypes of gormless men and shrimps on the barbecue\"  .\n\n\nThe Australian prime minister has, of course, vehemently denied the\nHawkish remarks of his predecessor as  \" deeply offensive and\ndefamatory\"  .\n\n\nHe admits, however, that  \" it might have been a reference to\na shorthand way of saying that Australia is way out of the northern\nhemisphere and hence has to work hard to be competitive\"  .\n\n\nLabour Party supporters of Mr Keating plead that the rear view was\nmerely a  \" geographical expression and in no way anatomical\"  .\n\n\nMr Keating has often derided  opposition National\nand Liberal parties as  \" un-Australian scum-bags\"  .\n\n\nThey are getting their own back now by calling Mr Keating unpatriotic\nand deriding the ruling party for washing their own dirty linen in public.\n\n\nWags who have an unflagging interest in political muck-raking at the\nsay Mr  remarks should end the acrimony over a new flag for\nAustralia.\n\n\n \" It should feature a pair of buttocks - - with the Southern\nCross embossed,\"  they say.  \n\n\n\n\n  Reprieve For Pawar  \n\n \n\nMr Sharad  belief that the people of Maharashtra\nwho  \" know me for the last 20 to 30 years\"  will bail him out\nof his current troubles may or may not be correct, but his meeting with the\nPrime Minister with at least ensure that the sniping at him from within the\nparty will be less virulent even if it does not stop altogether.\n\n\nThere is little doubt that his detractors within the party were\ndelighted at his discomfiture and made the most of the  \" politically\nunwise\"  act of suspending Mr G.R. Khairnar.\n\n\nTheir reaction was fully in keeping with the \ninternal politics which forces virtually all major leaders to be as much on\nguard against their party colleagues as against the adversaries outside.\n\n\nGiven the manner in which Mr Pawar had established himself after his\n bungling during the Bombay riots of December 1992 and\nJanuary 1993, he seemed destined not only for a long stint as  strong man but also to play an increasingly prominent role\nin Congress and national politics.\n\n\nMr  accusations, however, have checked that onward\nmarch and, for the present, Mr Pawar is obviously very much on the defensive.\n\n\nEven if his opponents within the party restrain themselves for the\ntime being, the others will not.\n\n\nNor will Mr Khairnar who seems to have become nearly as popular as Mr\nT.N. Seshan because of his campaign against corruption. \n\n \n\nBut two things are relevant in this context.\n\n\nFirst, just as not many people will be convinced by Mr  breezy dismissal of the charges made by Mr Khairnar as  \"\nfrivolous and baseless,\"  a time will also come when Mr Khairnar will\nhave to be a lot more specific about his allegations.\n\n\nSince he is reluctant to go to court, it is not clear who will judge\nthe authenticity of his charges, if at all he provides documentary evidence.\n\n\nPerhpas the departmental proceedings relating to his suspension will\nenable him to substantiate what he has been saying, but it is clear that\nsooner or later he will have to turn from rhetoric to something more\ncon-crete.\n\n\nSecondly, the political fallout from the controversy will also have\nto be assessed by both the Congress and its enemies.\n\n\nWhen Mr V.N. Gadgil referred to the politically unwise decisiion to\nsuspend Mr Khairnar, he was evidently thinking in terms of what was\ndetrimental to the interests of the party rather than the chief minister.\n\n\nBut the Congress will now have to consider to what extent any\nweakening of Mr  position will harm the party.\n\n\nMaharashtra is one of the crucial states so far as the Congress is\nconcerned and it cannot allow a situation where it will approach the next\nelections in a mood of uncertainty.\n\n\nMr Pawar will have to use his current reprieve to bolster his\nposition if he wants to remain in the big league.\n\n\nBut his success - - or its opposite - - will depend as much on his\nown efforts as those of Mr Khairnar.  <*> a dark line in the middle </*>\n\n\n  Action On Patents  \n\n \n\nThe Union  decision to amend the Indian\nPatents Act, 1970, was only to be expected.\n\n\nThe government can at best delay doing this till the winter session\nof Parliament.\n\n\nAny such postponement will be purely a political decision since the\nearlier the amendments are pushed through, the better it will be for India.\n\n\nOpposition parties are bound to exploit the \ndiscomfiture as the  decision to oppose the amendment shows.\n\n\nThe major Left parties have already declared their opposition.\n\n\nThe  problems are due to the fact that it had\ntaken a tough stand until now on the subject of product patenting.\n\n\nThe Indian view has been that process patenting will be legally\nprotected but not product patenting.\n\n\nThis position was based on the understanding that if Indian\ninnovators discovered new ways of producing a patented product, they should\nbe allowed to do so.\n\n\nIndeed, in much of east Asia early industrialisation was based on\nsuch  \" reverse engineering\"  .\n\n\nReverse engineering has, however, been less successful in India than\nin east Asia in the manufacture of world class products.\n\n\nMore often than not, Indian producers have produced only cheap\nimitations for the domestic market.\n\n\nManufacturers in developed countries have protested against such\nimitations which is why the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations sought to\noffer patent protection for products as well. \n\n \n\nWhile there is much merit in the original Indian position\nopposing product patenting, the fact is that India will have to fall in\nline with the rest of the world since an overwhelming majority of GATT\nmember-nations have gone along with the developed  in this\nmatter.\n\n\nIndeed, there has been some re-thinking even in India on the subject\nand some of the critics of product patenting, like the domestic drugs and\npharmaceuticals firms, have argued in favour of clearer patenting laws.\n\n\nThe key issue, however, is the efficiency of the patenting system and\nof the Patents Office.\n\n\nA recent report in this paper about a professor at an Indian\nInstitute of Management, who is aiding the codification of Indian systems of\nmedicine, approaching the U.S.\n\n\nPatents Office for patenting local medical systems on the grounds\nthat the Indian Patents Office  \" leaks\"  and is  \"\ncorrupt\"  is a shameful testimony to the sorry state of affairs in a\nvital area.\n\n\nAlong with amending the patent law, the government must ensure that\nthe institutional mechanism for patent protection is efficient and reliable\nand does not adversely affect the interests of Indians approaching it for\nprotection of their intellectual property rights.\n\n\nUnless the government can convince the people that what it is doing\nis in the national interest and not a response to external pressure, public\nmistrust will continue to be exploited by the opposition parties.  <*> a\ndark line in the middle </*>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "02b4fc15-a05d-460e-ac77-1d503876744b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.137695+00:00"}
{"text": "Gita    \" A River Sutra\n: \"  \n\n\n Two Views  \n\n\n C. N. Ramachandran   \nMangalore University \n\n \n\n \" A River Sutra \"  is Gita  third novel, the other two being  \" Karma Cola \"\n and  \" Raj \"  .\n\n\nWhile the first two novels are in the well-known comic-ironic mode,\nthis novel can be said to be roughly, in the allegorical mode.\n\n\nFurther, one wonders whether  \" A River Sutra \"\n can be called a novel at all.\n\n\nHaving the Western  \" Don Quixote \"  and the\nIndian  Dasakumara Charitha  as its models  \" The River\nSutra \"  exploits the formal possibilities of the genre to the\nfullest.\n\n\nIt is a framed narrative.\n\n\nIt is the story of an I.A.S. Officer, who, after retirement, chooses\nto be the manager of a Guest House, on the banks of the Narmada river in the\nVindhya range.\n\n\nSince at this spot, there are pilgrimage centres of Hindus, Jains,\nBuddhists and Muslims, the manager constantly comes across many pilgrims;\nand, occasionally, the pilgrims tell him their strange / tragic tales.\n\n\nThe novel, after the preamble, begins with  \" The  Story\"  , and ends with  \" The Song of the Narmada\"\n .\n\n\nIn all there are seven inset-stories. \n\n \n\nAlthough ancient Indian aestheticians were content to distinguish\nbetween  \" Katha \"  and  \" Akhyayika\n\"  on the basis of who the narrator is, and didn't explore the\nnarrative further,     if we\nbring together such long narratives as  \" Kathasaritsagara,\nPanchatantra, Kadambari \"  and  \" Dasakumara\nCharita  \" . we can construct an Indian narrative tradition and\nidentify its constituents.\n\n\nTo start with, all Indian narratives - - be they epics like \n\" Mahabaratha \"  , fiction such as  Kadambari \n, or folk-narratives like  \" Vethal Panchavimshati \"\n -  are framed narratives.\n\n\nIn fact, the strategy of  ` framing'  seems to be\nessentially oriental, which reached Europe during the Middle Ages through\nArabic.\n\n\nMany of  and  tales have been\ntraced back to India.   \n\n\nOften there is a  ` double or triple framing'  . \n \n\n\nSecondly, the narrative mode in the Indian ( or Oriental ) tradition\nis non-realistic and fantastic.\n\n\nThirdly, the framed stories are often variations of certain broad\nhuman experiences, no attempt being made to particularise either the\ncharacters or incidents in time and space.\n\n\nIn fact, almost all narratives can be said to be variations played on\na few archetypal patterns of human behaviour. \n\n \n\nIn a framed narrative, the frame could be passive or dynamic.\n\n\nA passive frame is one which functions only as a mechanical link\namong the diverse stories ( as in  Decameron  ) .\n\n\nOn the other hand, in a dynamic frame, there is constant mediation\nbetween the frame and the inset stories; each qualifying and commenting on\nthe other ( as in   \" Canterbury Tales\n\"  ) .\n\n\nAgain, a dynamic frame may function as a counterpoint to the inset\nstories, providing the work multiplicity of point of view or polyphony to use\n term    ( as in \n The Lost Honour of Katherina Bloom  .)\n\n\nOr, the frame may provide a specific spatio-temporal context, as A.K.\nRamanujan argues,    to the inset story / stories ( as\nin  \" The Hand  Tale \"  .)  \n\n \n\nGenerally, frames in Indian narratives are passive; they just\nserve to bring together assorted stories.\n\n\nOnly in the case of  \" Panchatantra \"  ,\nthe frame has some dynamism in it : the five princes who are told the various\nstories learn something from each story and at the end their maturation is\ncomplete.\n\n\nFrom this point of view the frame in  \" A River Sutra\n\"  is both functional and dynamic. \n\n \n\nThe narrator in the frame, the retired bureaucrat, isn't a\nknow-all wise man.\n\n\nOften, he doesn't either understand a tale told him or only partially\nunderstands it.\n\n\nAfter listening to the first tale (  ` The \nStory'  ) he is  ` disturbed'  ; and discusses the\nmeaning of the story with his older friend Tariq Mia.\n\n\nEven Tariq  explanation ( that  \" the human\nheart has only one secret, the capacity to love\"  p. 48 ) is beyond\nhis comprehension.\n\n\nSimilarly, after listening to the second story, the frame-narrator is\nperplexed and angry.\n\n\nHe tells the readers:  \" I was upset by the old  accusation that I did not understand the World\"  ( p.92).\n\n\nSometimes, even Mr. Chagla, his assistant, appears to be more\nknowledgeable.\n\n\nWhen Mr. Chagla states, as if he is stating the obvious, that \n\" without desire there is no life\"  , the framenarrator is\nbaffled.\n\n\n \" I stared at him in astonishment\"  , he adds ( p.\n142 ) . \n\n \n\nThe point to be noticed here is that the frame-narrator also\ngrows as the novel progresses.\n\n\nIn fact, from one point of view, he could be considered the centre\naround whom and whose process of perception and understanding of men and\nsociety, the entire novel revolves.\n\n\nWhen the novel begins, he is a   ` Vana prasthi'\n  , and he is determined to be totally detached from the\nworld, from the elevated position of self-assumed wisdom.\n\n\nBut at the end, his older friend, Tariq Mia tells him :  \"\nDestiny is playing tricks on you.\n\n\nDon't you realize you were brought here to gain the world, not\nforsake it ? \"  ( p. 228 )\n\n\nThe retired bureaucrat is annoyed and claims that he knows the world\nwell enough.\n\n\nLater, however, he realizes that still he is groping in the dark:\n \" I  started at the flashes of illumination,\nwondering for the first time what I would do if I ever left the Bungalow\"\n ( p. 282 ) . \n\n \n\nMore importantly, what is to be stressed in the structuring of\nthe novel is its multiple focalisation.   \n\n\nTariq Mia, the friend-philosopher of the main narrator, is also\nlimited in his grasp of men and matters.\n\n\nIn fact, there is no single character in the novel whose knowledge of\nthe world is not imparfect.\n\n\nEach tale, narrated from a limited point of view, is later discussed,\nanalysed and commented upon, again in their limited comprehension, by the two\nframe characters, who share a sort of teacher-pupil relationship.\n\n\nIn other words, the novelist here, consciously, seems to adapt the\nframework of the Upanishads-the pupil sitting close to the teacher and\nentering into a dialogue with him.\n\n\nIn the very beginning of the novel, the writer underscores this\npoint, making here principal narrator say :  \" Do you know what the\nword \" Upanishad \" means?\n\n\nIt means to sit beside and listen.\n\n\nHere I am, sitting, eager to listen.\"  ( p. 13 ) \n\n \n\nNow, coming to the framed tales, each of the seven tales is\ndesigned as a variation on the single theme of  ` attachment.'\n\n\n\nWhile the frame-narrator is one who has renounced the world, the\nfirst inset-story is of the heir to an international diamond merchant, who\nalso resolves ( following the model of Mahavira ) to renouce the world,\nyearning to be free from the world.\n\n\nBut, after becoming a Jain Monk, having renounced every possession,\nhe realises he has newer bonds with the world.\n\n\nAfter narrating his tale, he states, he has to hurry and join his\nbrother monks.\n\n\n \" I am too poor to renounce the world twice\"  , he\nadmits ( p. 41 ) .\n\n\nAnd this admission bewilders the principal narrator.\n\n\nThe succeeding tales also, similarly, play off the themes of \n` attachmentdetachment.' \n\n\nWhereas passionate attachment leads to tragic consequences in the\n `  Story'  and  ` The  Story', ` The  Story'  and\n ` The  Story'  uphold detachment.\n\n\nBut again the last story - -  ` The Song of the Narmada'\n - - registers the futility of detachment.\n\n\nThe Naga Baba returns to the world as an archaeologist and undertake\nNarmada excavations.\n\n\nIn other words, each tale  either contradicts\nor qualifies the implications of the earlier tale/s ( as in  \"\nCanterbury Tales \"  ) ; and all the insettales are qualified\nby the frame.\n\n\nConsequently, what we get at the end of the novel is a multiple\nvision of the  ` many-coloured dome'  - - Life. \n\n \n\nThe vision of life implied by the totality of the text is a\nparadoxical position of both  ` attachment-detachment.' \n\n\nThe frame and a few inset-stories mount a serious critique of\nattachment to the world in the form of wealth, power and sensual indulgence.\n\n\nWhile the principle narrator is sick of a highly placed  life and voluntarily becomes a  ` Vanaprastha'\n , the narrator of the  `  Story' \nis even more critical.\n\n\nHe observes in his diary that he and his  ` estate boys'\n , in their drinking, gambling and wenching, indulged in  \"\nCareless self-destruction.\" \n\n\nSimilarly the singer in  \" The  Story\"\n , transforms her unrequited love to the love of divine music.\n\n\n \n\nHowever, the novel rejects the concept of total detachment as\nwell.\n\n\nAt one point, Mr. Chagla gravely states to the frame-narrator:\n \" But, Sir, without desire there is no life.\n\n\nEverything will stand still.\n\n\nBecome emptiness.\n\n\nIn fact, Sir, be dead\"  ( p. 142 ) .\n\n\nProf. Shankar alias Naga Baba declares towards the end, dismissing\nthe divinity of the river Narmada :  \" If anything is sacred about the\nriver, it is the individual experiences of the human beings who have lived\nhere\"  ( p. 267 ) . \n\n \n\nSuch profound affirmation of life and human experience is\nreinforced by repeated motifs of love and rebirth.\n\n\nThe allusions to the penance of Uma to achieve  love,\nto the five arrows of  Kama ( Panchasayaka)  which none can\nwithstand, to the death of  Kama ( Kamadahana)  which makes\n birth possible, to the origins of  Veena \ncreated by Shiva to immortalize  immortal beauty, to the seven\nnotes of music which are all drawn from Nature-all these allusions indirectly\nuphold the divinity of love, and conjugal bliss.\n\n\nThe lyrics of the great Sufi poet Rumi, quoted here and there\nappropriately, again strengthen this motif - - of love, both human and\ndivine.\n\n\nIn fact, the entire novel,  \" The River Sutra \"\n , is a fascinating mosaic of rich and \nrepetitive images, motifs, and allusions. \n\n \n\nWhat places the novel at the centre of Indian narrative tradition\nis that each inset story seems to have been selected and elaborated with an\nawareness of the Indian  Rasa  theory.\n\n\nFor instance, the  story, based on renunciation,\nhas  ` Shanta'  as its  Sthayi  , and \nKaruna  as  Sanchari rasas  .\n\n\nThe  story, centred on greed and jealousy, evokes\n Bhibhatsa  and concommitant  Karuna  .\n\n\nWhile the  story evokes  Sringara \nand  Vira  , the  story  Adbhuta\n and  Hasya  .\n\n\nWhile  Vipralambha Sringara  and  Karuna\n are communicated through the  story, \nAdbhuta  and  Karuna  dominate the  story.\n\n\nIt is appropriate from this point of view that the \ntitle is partially Indian: the River  ` Sutra'  . \n\n \n\nThe all-pervasive central symbol in the novel is the river\nNarmada.\n\n\nThe novel captures her varied moods from varying angles.\n\n\nThe river, born in the Vindhyas and flowing west-wards, is the\nmeeting point of all the central characters in the climatic moments of their\nlives.\n\n\nShe is the  \" Delightful one\"  ,  \" forever\nholy, forever inexhaustible.\" \n\n\nIf sometimes she appears as a bride, flowing to meet her bridegroom,\nthe ocean with all ardour, some other times she has the allurement of a\nwhore.\n\n\nIn fact, as Dr. Mitra explains to the bureaucrat,  ` narmada'\n in Sanskrit, also means  ` a whore'  .\n\n\nWhat interests Dr. Shankar, the archaeologist, in Narmada is not that\nit is a  ` holy'  river but that it is an immortal river.\n\n\nThat is,  \" the Narmada has never changed its course.\n\n\nWhat we are seeing today is the same river that was seen by the\npeople who lived here a hundred thousand years ago.\n\n\nTo me such a sustained record of human presence in the same\nplace-that is immortality\"  ( p.264 ) .\n\n\nThe cave drawings in the vicinity of Narmada are among he  \"\noldest evidence of human life in India.\" \n\n\nThe ancient Alexandrian geographer, Ptolemy, wrote about the Narmada.\n\n\nVyasa is supposed to have dictated his Mahabharatha on this river\nbank and  works graphically describe the river and the\nnearby Vindya range.\n\n\n \" It is as if reason and instinct are constantly warring on\nthe banks of the Narmada.\n\n\nI mean, even the war between the Aryans and the pre-Aryans is  still unresolved here\"  ( p. 153 ) . \n\n \n\nObviously, Narmada symbolises Life in general, and Indian\nculture and society in particular.\n\n\nThe river, with Shiva and Supaneshwara temples on one side, the\nMuslim mosque and the tomb of the Sufi poet, Rumi, on the other and many\nJain, Buddhist and tribal temples and shrines scattered over its course,\nsymbolises the culture that is both ancient and modern, both monotheistic and\ntheistic, and both Aryan and non-Aryan.\n\n\nIn fact,  The River Sutra  could as well have been titled\n ` Bharath Sutra'  . \n\n\n * ( Paper presented at a Seminar on  `

{"text": "BIOTECHNOLOGY  <box>  \n\n\nMummy Daddy   </box>  \n\n \n\n In  the 1970s, newspapers went ape over a series of\nextraordinary anthropological finds in East Africa.\n\n\nThis was at a time when there was more or less a consensus that the\ngroup of non-ape primates - - hominids, to give them their name - - that\nhad eventually evolved into humans had appeared about 15 million years ago.\n\n\nThe media flashed each step in the dramatic discoveries that led to a\nbetter understanding of early human evolution.\n\n\nIf the media was excited, scientists too were no less thrilled over\nthe Kenyan fossils of  Homo habilis  and   Homo erectus\n  .\n\n\nTanzania literally had the world on its knees studying the 3.7 million\nyear old footprints left behind by some unknown human ancestor.\n\n\nThe fossilized bones of Ethiopian  ` Lucy'  and her\nfellow australopithecenes stirred scientific speculation to fever pitch.\n\n\nMany scientists devoted their entire careers to drawing up updated,\nbetter resolved and more detailed evolutionary family trees of mankind. \n\n \n\nIt was this complacent scenario that was rudely shaken by its\nhitherto firm foundations by an academic atom bomb exploded, in 1987,\nby Allan Wilson and Vincent Sarich, of the University of California,\nBerkeley, U.S.A.\n\n\nIf found to be correct, their theory promised to re-write the\nentire history of man. \n\n \n\nThe claims of the Berkeley biochemists can be summed up in\njust one sentence.\n\n\nEach person on earth today, they announced, could trace his or her\nancestry back to a single woman who lived in Africa 200,000 years ago.\n\n\nThe press, ever quick on the uptake, baptised her  `\nEve' - - the mother of mankind. \n\n \n\n ` Eve'  soon became the bone of contention\nbetween palaeontologists and biochemists with battle lines being drawn up and\nno quarters given.\n\n\nThe story of Eve is also the story of the clash of the Titans,\nbetween those who dug up evidence of the past in the form of fossilized\nremains and those who looked into test tubes for clues to the past.\n\n\nBut what exactly had Sarich and Wilson done that had sparked off such\ncontroversy ?\n\n\nSarich and Wilson were not new to announcing provocative theories on\nhuman evolution.\n\n\nTheir initial salvo in the field was fired in the 1960s itself with\nresults similar to the reactions they were getting now. \n\n \n\nThe sixties was a time for  ` hands-on' \nanthropology.\n\n\nFossil remains were carefully excavated, carted with infinite care\nto the laboratories and studied in detail over years.\n\n\nVincent Sarich and Allan Wilson decided to look for clues to the\npast, not in the African savanna but inside the body itself, among its\nproteins to be precise.\n\n\nThe question to which they addressed themselves was one which\ncontemporary anthropologists were also aiming at.\n\n\n ` When did the human line first branch off from the apes'\n ? \n\n \n\nWilson and Sarich decided to look at the proteins of the body and\nto compare them to - - evolutionarily speaking - - our closest relatives.\n\n\nThey knew that even the same protein in related species is\nslightly different because of mutations that occur after the species split\noff from a common ancestor.\n\n\nThis reasoning was fairly conservative and in keeping with facts and\nbeliefs of the day.\n\n\nBut the twist in the tale came when the two biochemists claimed that\nmutations occurred, through time, at a steady rate, much like a molecular\nclock ticking away at predictable intervals.\n\n\nThey claimed that it was this molecular ticking of the proteins that\ncould serve to date the separation of species from a common ancestor.\n\n\nSpecies that had the most diverse proteins must have separated early\nand the differences accumulated over the long time following separation.\n\n\nThose with kindred proteins obviously had split away more\nrecently. \n\n \n\nAccording to the biochemical evidence gleaned from a study of\nprotein similarity they announced that humans were most distantly related\nto the lemurs ( among primates ) and most closely to gorillas and\nchimpanzees.\n\n\nIn fact, the protein clock indicated that the proteins of\nchimpanzees, gorillas and humans had diverted a scant 5 million years ago,\nmuch to the chagrin of established anthropologists of the day who had\nfavoured the 15 million year date as being the time of divergence.\n\n\nIronically the 1970s discoveries that had so excited the\nanthropologists now ruled in favour of Wilson and Sarich.\n\n\nPaleonathropolgists had to bow before evidence they themselves had\ndug up.\n\n\nThey were hoist with their own petard and grudgingly accepted that\nthe road to humankind began about 5 to 7 million years ago.\n\n\nSome of the 15 million year old bones that they had dug up belonged\nto direct ancestors of the orangutan and not man as they had hoped.\n\n\nWilson and his colleagues did not rest on their laurels.\n\n\nBy the late 1970s they wre readying themselves for the big showdon.\n\n\nIt was to be a battle between the bones and the genes. \n\n \n\nThe consensus at that time was that all modern human populations\ncould trace their genesis back to one million years ago.\n\n\nThis was when  Homo erectus  first came out of  Africa to As1a, Europe and Indonesia.\n\n\nConventional interpretation of subsequent fossil finds held that\n Homo erectus  evolved into modern  H. sapiens  in each of\nthese places.\n\n\nRegional differences that characterise the variety of our species\ncame later. \n\n \n\nWilson and his colleagues decided to use another molecular\nclock to test the accuracy of the one million year divergence date.\n\n\nThis time they chose the mitochondria to act as a molecular clock.\n\n\nMitochondria are the extranuclear, cellular organelles that work\nas the powerhouse of a cell.\n\n\nThey also contain a little deoxyribonucleic acid which is called mDNA\nto differentiate it from the nDNA or nuclear DNA. \n\n \n\nMitochondrial genes differ from chromosomal genes in fundamental\nways.\n\n\nAn offspring gets equal amounts of nuclear DNA from both his parents.\n\n\nThe  sperm is an actuality nothing more than the\nvehicle for nDNA.\n\n\nHowever, the  ovum contains cellular organelles as\nwell as the nDNA.\n\n\nThe  mitochondria are thus passed on to the child.\n\n\nThis is an almost exclusively maternal line of inheritance.\n\n\nMitochondrial genes also  have a higher rate of\nmutation as compared to nuclear genes. \n\n \n\nMitochondrial genes wre thus uniquely suited to act as molecular\nclocks especially since  studies had indicated that human\nmitochondrial DNA mutated at a steady rate of 2-4 per cent every million\nyears.\n\n\nThis would mean about 330-660 mutations per million years. \n\n \n\nLike his earlier work which had pinpointed the time of divergence\nof the human stock, the mDNA clock focused on the diversity caused by\naccumulated mutations over the years.\n\n\nOnly this time different species were not being studied.\n\n\nWhat was scrutinized was the difference between separate populations\nof the human species.\n\n\nWilson and his colleagues wanted to use mDNA as a tool to analyse how\nmDNA in Asians differed from its counterparts in Africans or Europeans.\n\n\n \n\nIn the mid-1980s  students Rebecca Cann and Mark\nStoneking took mitochondrial DNA from women living in Europe, Asia, Africa,\nNew Guinea and Australia for detailed comparative analyses.\n\n\nIn 1987, they announced their findings.\n\n\nMost of the mDNA from the five sources were strikingly similar.\n\n\nThis meant that the groups had diverged recently and differences had\nnot had time to build up.\n\n\nHowever, there was one extremely significant finding.\n\n\nThe mDNA from the African lineages showed twice as much diversity\nas the rest.\n\n\nThis indicated that the African mDNA was the oldest.\n\n\nIt had been around for at least twice as long as the others. \n\n \n\nAnthropologists agreed with the story till this point because,\nafter all, the oldest fossils were African.\n\n\nBut the harmony ended abruptly with the subsequent claims from  laboratory. \n\n \n\nThe biochemists claimed that all living humans share as their\nearliest common ancestor, an African woman who lived a mere 200,000 years\nago.\n\n\nThere was a discrepancy of about 800,000 years between their\ncalculations and that of the conventional  .\n\n\nIt was a difficult concept to accept and many traditional\nanthropologists dismissed Eve as a  ` biochemical bauble'  .\n\n\nHowever, it must be made clear that there is no evidence yet of a\ntime on earth when only one single woman walked it.\n\n\nMany other women must have lived at the same time but their\nmitochondrial lineages have just not survived.\n\n\nThus, in a way the label  ` Eve'  is a trifle\nmisleading. \n\n \n\nThe  ` Eve'-hypothesis holds that all current\nhumans harbour no non-African genes predating Eve.\n\n\nThis meant that  people wiped out local populations and\nthe results of inbreeding ( if any ) did not survive long enough to leave\ntheir stamp on human history.\n\n\nThis drastic revision of conventionally held views was,\npredictably enough, not taken sitting down by older, established\nanthropologists.\n\n\nThey questioned the accuracy of  the\nmolecular clock by which evolution was timed.\n\n\nFor the clock to be precise and reliable a couple of assumptions must\nhold true.\n\n\nThe genetic similarity of the species being studied must be a\nfunction of their relatedness and also directly proportional to the recency\nof their divergence from a common ancestor.\n\n\nThis, in turn, requires that the genetic matter mutate at a constant\nrate.\n\n\nThen again, the mutations should not affect the survival of the\nindividual.\n\n\nThat is to say, the individual should neither be culled nor favoured\nby natural selection.\n\n\nCulling would tend to eliminate mutations and preserve the original\ngene such that the common ancestor seems more recent.\n\n\nFavoured selection for a particular mutation would, conversely, make\nthe divergence seem more distant in time. \n\n \n\nHowever, the biochemists are quick to point out that the mDNA\nthat they chose to study are  \" neutral\"  for slection.\n\n\nThis is basically because much of the DNA here is junk DNA or DNA\nthat does not contain sequences that code for proteins.\n\n\nThese also do not seem to affect the   phenotype at all.\n\n\nThus there seems to be no reason why natural selection should\nfavour or cull the individuals. \n\n \n\nOther dissenters pointed out that at least one other factor would\ninterfere with the molecular clock.\n\n\nThis factor is what they call  \" random loss\"  .\n\n\nThis refers to the genetic loss in each generation when some women\ndie childless.\n\n\nWhenever this happens a mitochondrial type is irrevocably lost to\nhistory.\n\n\nThus while mutations increase the amount of variation within a\npopulation, random loss constantly eats away at it.\n\n\nThe refutation of this charge is that while random loss of lineages\nmight influence the number of mitochondrial types around at any point in\ntime, but the ones that survive will have the same degree of varition among\nthem.\n\n\nAnd since this is what the clock runs on, it runs well despite random\nloss. \n\n \n\nWith the debate becoming acrimonious, both sides dug deep into\ntheir arsenal of academic weapons to consolidate their position.\n\n\nWith the quantum leap in biotechnological methods now available\n school now holds an ace up its sleeve. \n\n \n\nPolymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) that allows researchers to\nisolate the gene of choice and to amplify it has been a boon.\n\n\nInstead of comparing patterns of DNA fragments cut by restriction\nenzymes as Cann did in her original study, PCR helps produce sample that can\nbe compared base pair by base pair along any chosen length of DNA. \n\n \n\nLinda Vigilant, another of  students made\nelegant use of PCR technique.\n\n\nShe compared mitochondrial DNA obtained from a single hair taken\nfrom almost a hundred volunteers coming from different genetic stocks.\n\n\nShe focussed on a section of the mDNA that is known to mutate at a\nfaster rate than other regions.\n\n\nThis is called the control region.\n\n\n study also validated  finding\nthat African lineages were the oldest.\n\n\nBut  research did not end there.\n\n\nShe compared the amount of diversity among the different African\nmDNA with the diversity between African mDNA and the mDNA of a chimpanzee.\n\n\nThe chimpanzee was chosen as an animal model for relatedness because\nthere is now universal consensus that they split off the human line some 5\nmillion years ago.\n\n\nThe time span is thus known.\n\n\nAnalyses revealed that the chimp mDNA and human mDNA had diverged 42\nper cent during these 5 million years.\n\n\nThis gives a divergence rate of about 8.4 per cent per million\nyears.\n\n\nThe most intriguing finding was that the divergence among the\nAfrican types was just 2 per cent.\n\n\nOn the scale of the molecular clock this would translate to 250,000\nyears ago.\n\n\nThe figure is undoubtedly very close to the magical 200,000 years\nthat is  `  '  age.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4eb918b7-8116-4324-a528-378d8fc35e3e",

{"text": "Consolidating the gains  \n\n \n\nTHE APPROACH TO the Eighth Plan by the newly constituted Planning\nCommission and the National Front Government seems to have so many facets\nthat it is unclear what will be the eventual outcome and how the Planning\nCommission will be finalising the Approach Paper and determining the\ncontent of the Plan outlay.\n\n\nFrom the observations of Mr. Ramakrishna Hegde, Vice Chairman of\nthe Planning Commission and its members and those of the Prime Minister Mr.\nV. P. Singh, the Finance Minister, Mr. Madhu Dandavate, and the Industry\nMinister, Mr. Ajit Singh, it would appear that the accent would be on faster\ngeneration of employment with the same doses of inputs and decentralised\nplanning which will make available to the weaker sections, particularly\nthose in the semi-urban and rural areas, the fruits of developmental\nexpenditure to a greater extent than hitherto.\n\n\nThe draft Approach Paper has understandably not given any indication\nof the outlays and the areas of development, physical targets and growth\nrates as it is felt that numbers have no relevance, nor do quantification\nof inputs and outputs, and what really matters is a significant improvement\nin the lot of the common man, eradication of poverty and providing work\nfor every able bodied person.\n\n\nThe Prime Minister has cautioned the Planning Commission about\nunplanned decentralisation.\n\n\nHe has also suggested that there should be some quantification of\ngoals so that it will be possible to know what is being done and what should\nbe the progress in the desired directions.\n\n\nThe Finance Minister, for his part, is keen on securing a growth rate\nwhich will ensure a bigger national cake which could be shared equitably by\nall sections of the population and the desired objective of disbursed incomes\nand development of small and cottage industries can also be realised.\n\n\nMr. Ajit Singh, the Union Minister for Industry, is anxious that there\nshould be larger investments, faster industrial development and spectacular\ngrowth in export earnings even while bringing about dispersed development.\n\n\n \n\nWhat is the import of these observations, what will be the content\nof the Eighth Plan and what should be its size?\n\n\nNo clear answers to these questions are available as yet though it is\nexpected that a picture will emerge after the availability of resources had\nbeen determined and the apparatus required for decentralised planning had\nbeen created.\n\n\nEven in respect of decentralised planning, it is not as if there had\nbeen no thinking in this regard earlier.\n\n\nThe development of community blocks, formation of district centres\nor formulation of regional plan schemes have been thought of but the\ncompulsion to achieve growth in some directions and the differing emphasis\non plan implementation had led to the neglect of agricultural, industrial or\ninfrastructural development at various times in the different Plans.\n\n\nThe need to achieve faster progress in some sectors at particular\nstages had obviously led to uncoordinated plan implementation in the face\nof inadequacy of resources.\n\n\nBut there is no doubt that impressive progress has been made in many\ndirections in nearly four decades of Planning.\n\n\nIf one looks at the levels of production and performance in earlier\nyears, it will be readily recognised that the additions to irrigated area,\ngenerating capacity or industrial capability have been truly remarkable.\n\n\nBut the lack of adequate emphasis on development of agricultural\nsector in the Second, Third and Fourth Plan periods and the slackening pace\nof development of energy sources had a distorting effect on regional progress\nand inequitable distribution of the benefits of the growth in the gross\ndomestic product.\n\n\nWith the thrust to agricultural production in the last two years\nof the Seventh Plan, a sustained growth in industrial production with the\npublic sector enterprises giving a better account of themselves and\nbuoyancy in the capi tal and stock markers enabling rapid expansion of the\nprivate industrial sector, the economy is now in much better shape than it\nhas been at any time in the recent past.\n\n\nHowever, the question may well be asked whether the\nmobilisa-tion of resources has been attempted in a noninflationary\nmanner and heavy doses of deficit financing have not accentuated pressures on\nprices.\n\n\nAlso, the huge trade deficits in the 1980s have resulted in a large\nincrease in external indebtedness and debt servicing obligations now\nabsorb over 24 per cent of the total export earnings.\n\n\nIf inflationary financing is to be avoided and the Plan outlay\nrestricted to resources in sight and those that can be quantified over a\nperiod, the aggregate Plan outlay may not be very impressive.\n\n\nHowever, even a smaller outlay can be more effective if, as the\nPrime Minister has observed, the existing assets are utilised more\npurposefully and there is no wasteful use of resources or leakage and the\npriorities are wisely conceived.\n\n\nBut the planners will have difficulty in determining the allocations\nas it is now recognised that heavy investment will have to be made in the\ncreation of capacity for power generation, oil exploration and exploita\ntion, development of railway facilities, increasing coal raisings,\nmodernising steel plants, expeditious implementation of fertilizer\nprojects, irrigation schemes and development of agriculture.\n\n\nThe impression is sought to be given that investment in the rural\nsector has not been sizable and 50 per cent of the total Plan outlay will\nhave to be earmarked for benefiting the rural areas in 1990-95.\n\n\nActually, the outlay on irrigation schemes, minor irrigation\nprojects, rural electrification, energisation of pumpsets, development of\nroads, construction of warehouses and the execution of welfare programmes and\nfamily planning are absorbing close to half the total outlay.\n\n\nWhat is required is greater emphasis on these schemes.\n\n\nA sharp rise in agricultural production from the irrigated and\nrainfed areas and the development of food processing industries by themselves\nwill genrate larger employment and an improvement in incomes and standards of\nliving of the rural population.\n\n\nIt has also to be ensured that regional imbalances are rectified\nwith greater attention to the weaknesses in the agricultural sector in the\nEastern region, power shortage in the Southern region and equitable\ndistribution of scarce fossil fuel resources especially natural gas.\n\n\nThere will of course have to be a determined bid to improve the\nbalance of payments with a contraction of the trade deficit and an\nincrease in the invisible receipts.\n\n\nThe Union Minister for Commerce, Mr. Arun Nehru, has emphasised the\nneed for raising exports more impressively and eschewing unwanted imports in\nsuch a way that the trade deficit does not continue to be worrisome.\n\n\nThe planners and the Government have thus to ensure that economic\ngrowth is at a faster rate with broad, specific goals and the increase in\nnational income is more meaningful for the lower income groups and those\nbelow the poverty line. \n\n\n  Fouled planet  \n\n \n\n DECISION TO sign the Basle Convention to control\nthe movement of hazardous wastes reflects its awareness of the threat\nposed to health, safety and environment by the widely prevailing and callous\nindifference to the handling and disposal of lethal rubbish.\n\n\nThe most menacing of such wastes is nuclear material and it is\ntherefore surprising that it is not included among the 47 categories of\nwastes from hazardous industries covered by the Convention.\n\n\nThe Convention also does not provide for payment of compensation for\ndamage resulting from the movement of hazardous wastes.\n\n\nIndia and the other 115 countries which had earlier adopted the draft\nconvention should insist on the removal of such lacunae before they sign the\nconvention when it is finalised.\n\n\nCoverage of nuclear waste is vitally important as its exclusion would\nmake the prohibition of the export of hazardous wastes provided for in the\nConvention virtually meaningless since at present the smaller non-nuclear\ncountries are being exposed to the mercies of nuclear powers using them as\ndumping grounds in all manner of ways.\n\n\nWhat makes the scene very chilling is that the neighbours of the\nnuclear powers are often not even aware of what is going on because of the\nhighly organised conspiracy of secrecy surrounding nucelar waste dumping.\n\n\nAccording to one estimate, 70,000 tonnes of nuclear wastes were\ndumped into the sea by U.K. until 1980, with the world living in blissful\nignorance of it until the U.K. National Union of Seamen boycotted the\nactivity.\n\n\nThe bulldozing of nuclear waste from a closed uranium processing\nfacility at Canonsburg near Pittsburgh, U.S. led in 1980 to the discovery\nthat the incidence of leukaemia in the town was as high as 67 in just 45\nhouses in one street. \n\n \n\nThe record of the richer countries in the matter of disposal of\nnon-nuclear toxic wastes is just as outrageous.\n\n\nSeals died in large numbers in North Sea in 1988 because of the\ndumping of huge quantities of chemical pollutants.\n\n\nIn 1987, shipments of the highly toxical chemical waste,\npolychlorinated biphenyls, handled by an Italian waste dispoal firm in\ncollusion with a local landowner were about to be dumped in Nigeria.\n\n\nBut the Nigerian Government woke up to what was going on and\nordered the removal of the drums of the chemical which had landed in the\ncountry.\n\n\nThe exclusion of nuclear wastes from its coverage by the Basle\nConvention will only give rise to suspi<l.cions about an unwillingness to\ntake note of the ways of the nuclear powers and discipline them.\n\n\nThough it is too much to hope that just the adoption of an\ninternational convention will put an end to the littering of the planet by\nthe nuclear powers, nothing should stop countries like India from imparting\nto the Convention an awareness of the responsibility of the industrial\nnations in fouling the global environment.  \n\n\n\n\n  Some respite from frenzy  \n\n \n\nTHE VISHWA HINDU  decision to defer its plan\nto commence the construction of the Rama temple, slated for February 14, in\nresponse to the appeal of the Prime Minister, Mr. V. P. Singh, gives the\ncountry some breathing space in what is clearly a very troubled period.\n\n\nIf indeed the VHP had gone ahead with its plan, it would have\nwitnessed another painful bout of inter-communal tensions and violence.\n\n\nThe Prime Minister did the right thing in couching his appeal to\nthe VHP to defer its programme in terms of the fact that the country was\nat a sensitive juncture.\n\n\nThere is indeed a national security dimension to the entire Ayodhya\nissue.\n\n\nPolitical forces in Pakistan which are now building up an\ninternational campaign on the basis of the Kashmir developments and are\nattempting to rally sentiments in the Islamic world against India would be\nonly too happy to seize upon the potential in a communally charged situation.\n\n\nThe episode involving the  Shilanyas  ceremony\nwhich had triggered a chain of communal riots last November - - and had\nbrought back to life one of the most sordid features of Indian political\nhistory - - evoked a sharp reaction from across the border.\n\n\nThe VHP and like minded organisations should recognise the unwisdom\nof preempting the judicial process.\n\n\nThey should resist the temptation of retreating into hair-spitting\narguments as to whether the proposed site is disputed or not and should\nin the interest of communal harmony, go a step further to abjure their\nperiodically raised politically-timed moves to begin construction work on the\nfoundation laid last November.\n\n\nIt is to be noted that the  response to the Prime  appeal still remains in the realm of  \" let us wait\nand see\"  .\n\n\nThere is no categorical assurance that the programme has been\ndeferred for all the four months sought by the Prime Minister in which time\nthe proposed committee is to begin its search for a solution.\n\n\nIn fact, it was said that the VHP action committee would meet in\nAyodhya on February 13 and 14 to decide the future course of action on the\ncommencement of the construction work.\n\n\nEvidently, although the VHP has grudgingly accepted the  \"\npolitical will\"  of the new Government to find a solution to the\ncomplex issue, it is still not willing to commit itself to the results of the\nprocess that the Government has initiated.\n\n\nThe VHP general secretary, Mr. Ashok Singhal, has said that the\nproposed committee is only a mediatory body and that the VHP would not\nabide by any of its decisions.\n\n\nThis is a cynical response to a sincere attempt to find a way out of\nthe stalemate on the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue.\n\n\nFor the present, the country certainly has been saved from the\nconsequences of the deterioration of the political atmosphere that would have\nset in had the VHP stuck to its date.\n\n\nThe toll in human lives taken by the Ayodhya issue and the\ncommunal violence in the aftermath of the  Shilanyas \nprocessions holds a grim warning that tactics employed by the VHP and its ilk\nhave drastic consequences that the nation can ill afford.\n\n\nTherefore, the issue cannot be viewed only in terms of the rights and\nwrongs or the validity of the respective historical claims in the interim\nperiod until a solution satisfactory to both the communities is arrived at.\n\n\nThere would necessarily have to be a total freeze on any kind of\npolitical or communal activity in aid of the respective claims in order to\nstave off any further deterioration in the atmosphere between the two\ncommunities. \n\n \n\nThe proposed committee announced by the Government has a\ndifficult task ahead.\n\n\nThe issue has indeed defied unravelling in the recent period with\nvarious mediatory attempts having petered out.\n\n\nSeveral distinguished historians have pointed out that a review of\nthe historical evidence suggests that the claims made by the Hindu and the\nMuslim communal groups can find no sanction from history.\n\n\nIt would indeed be a difficult business for the courts or any\nmediatory panel to determine the prior antiquity of the respective shrines.\n\n\nThey have correctly pointed out that the entire issue would in turn\nraise the question of the limits to the logic of restoration of religious\nsites.\n\n\n \" How far back do we go?\n\n\nCan we push this to the restoration of Buddhist and Jain monuments\ndestroyed by Hindus?\n\n\nOr of pre-Hindu animist shrines?\"  these historians have\nasked.\n\n\nIt must also be remembered that a decision on the Babri Masjid issue\nwould form a precedent for the similarly disputed shrines elsewhere in the\ncountry.\n\n\nThus it would be best for the committee to consider seriously the\nsuggestion to declare the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid complex a\nnational monument.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8b4db9fa-ed20-41b4-9676-f3261f45268f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.141736+00:00"}

\n\n  THOMAS   Easley, the\nforty-year-old artist from California whose paintings are being exhibited\nat Habiart, has arange of serious interests.\n\n\nHis metaphysics, deriving from Gurdjeff and Ouspensky and presented in\na style that smacks too much of revealation and the absolutism of its\nauthority, is inaccessible to low IQ types like me who need step by step\nreasoning.\n\n\nBut his poetry has clarity, it yearns for a world cleansed of\ncruelties and pain.\n\n\nThis aspect of his sensibility has contextual relevance, for the\nproceeds from the sale of the works exhibited will go for the treatment of\nAnshu Saxena, a teenager of Gaumukteshwar on whom some vandals sprayed\nacid. \n\n \n\nThere seems to be only one painting directly related to this\ntragedy and it suggests that while  compassion is\ngenuine, his sensibility shies away from a direct encounter with the tragic.\n\n\nOne side of the  face has been totally disfigured and\nwill need repeated plastic surgery.\n\n\nShe is, therefore, constrained to wear a veil on this side.\n\n\nIn the painting, Easley has made the veil transparent.\n\n\nHe could thus have presented an image that could thrust deep into us\nwith a shaft of pain, an image of contrasts, of sadism cruelly mauling\nlife.\n\n\nBut in the painting, the side of the face seen under the veil is just\nlike the other side.\n\n\nThe picture has become an exercise in contrasting clear and muted\ntones.\n\n\nIs this carping criticism?\n\n\nWe have to note the paradox that while cruelty has enormously\nincreased in the modern world, the abillity to look on it direct, to be\na vicarious victim of it, has been lost.\n\n\nPerhaps we should recover the chilling but necessary courage to\nlook on Bhima drinking the blood of Dussasana as in Kathakali and, as\nUnamuno said, on the emaciated, blook-stained Christ, the harsh Maria\nDolorosa rigid with grief. \n\n \n\nWe have had a spate of paintings on the Bhopal tragedy, the\nbiggest industrial disaster in history, but not one which I can remember\nto have been anything more than yet another attempt at picture-making, yet\nanother instance of the cry of suffering breathed into a flute to become a\nserene song, as Unamuno puts it.\n\n\nFrancis of Assisi felt the cruel pains inflicted on the luckless so\nintensely after, and because, he felt the tortures of Jesus so intensely that\nthe stigmata of the wounds appeared on his body too.\n\n\nBut Easley certainly cannot be singled out for this failure of the\nmodern sensibility.\n\n\nThe donated paintings include landscapes, nude and genre studies and\nthe last show some sympathetic identification with people in a casual\nlabourers in construction and other types. \n\n \n\nHieronymus Bosch, the medieval Flemish painter whose art\nsurprisingly anticipates modern surrealism, painted weired pictures where\ncreepers and flowers sprout from all the orifices, including the\nunmentionable of human beings.\n\n\nMedieval fears were strong in him and perhaps flowes represented\ndelight which was the  temptation.\n\n\nIn the metamorphoses in the paintings of Laxman Pai ( Dhoomimal\nCentre) there is mercifully no such inner conflict.\n\n\nTresses of hair growing into sheaves of golden grain, eyes\nlengthening into birds, all suggest an interprenetration of man and nature, a\ncommunion that leads to interbeing.\n\n\nHowever, this has been his style for years now and the lyricism is\nfading somewhat was the familiarity.\n\n\nBut he has compensated this a little through a greater variety of\ntextures and a brighter palette with glowing, gem-like highlights.\n\n\nThe painting  \" Unrest-1989\"  stands apart and its\nviolently streaked sky with its plintered bars of fiery colour brings us\nout of the bee-loud glade of the other pictures into the mess that has\nbecome our social reality and about which we have to do something if we are\nto survive! \n\n \n\nA spate of group shows.\n\n\nAmong the young artists, mostly from the Jamia Millia, who exhibited\nat Alliance Francaise, Seema Murtaza contributed promising studies of\npeasant women, Moeen Fatima good portraits and Rajkumar Panwar terracotta\nfigurines of peasant types.\n\n\nRecalling Sutainder  whimsical surrealism was Bhim  photograph with clouds ( collaged) inside a drawing room.\n\n\nThe Triveni annual had a high standard, but with all participants\ncontributing works in their by now very familiar manner, comment would be a\nrepetition, though Shruti Gupta  drawings, mostly of\npeople at work, deserve mention.\n\n\nThe same is the general situaiton in the Display Gallery show\nthough Suraj  fine landscapes with their mood quality\nlinger in memory.\n\n\nThe Village Gallery presents some excellent graphics among them Uttam\n wood intaglio with tragic overtones.\n\n\nMickey  portrait study in litho and Jayant  large woodcuts.\n\n\nConsidering that Sailoz Mookerjea taught at the Ukil School in the\nold days, the group show by the final year students at AIFACS suggests that\nit has not weathered the years too well.     \n\n \n\n\n  Excellent water colours at AIFACS    <*> line from left to right </*>\n\n\n Exibitions  / Krishna Chaitanya <*> line from left to\nright </*>\n\n \n\n  THE   watercolour exhibitions\nwhich AIFACS has instituted as an annual feature have made a major\ncontribution to the revival of work and interest in the medium and with\nKanwal Krishna looking after the selection and judging, the Eighth Annual\nmaintains an excellent standard.\n\n\nThe medium is at its best in a lyrical response to nature and we\nget the feel of space, clean air and quiet water in the river scenes of\nParesh Maity, the rapid play of light under a sky with swiftly racing clouds\nin Gurao and the light, moist veil of mist in the mountainscape by Salim,\nwhile Anita Lal manages to recapture the poetic impressionism of Whistler\nwhere the landscape features melt into a mood.\n\n\nSince the medium rules out corrections, portrait work in it can be\nvery exacting and Mahadeo Kamble has to be felicitated for his splendid\nsuccess here. \n\n \n\nEqual success cannot be claimed for the annual traditional art\nexhibitions instituted by AIFACS.\n\n\nPerhaps the concept itself was never fully clarified.\n\n\nIf there was no modulation, even mutations, in fact evolution in\ntradition, we would all have been amoebae.\n\n\nPerhaps, in next  show which would be the Seventh\nAnnual, guidelines should be laid down making it clear that closely\ncopying the manner and idiom of Madhubani or Moghul or Rajput miniature is\nnot what is expected.\n\n\nThis is what we mostly get in the current show.\n\n\nBut there are a few works that charge traditional parameters with\nstartling originality.\n\n\nWith its rectilinear treatment of figures and decoratively curvaceous\ndrawing of the  body, Balvant   \"\nKaliya Daman\"  is a virile composition.\n\n\nEven more imaginatively, Kiran Maini creates separate spaces for\nepisodes, overlaps them transparently in spite of the vibrant strength of\nthe ground colours and builds up an integrated composition based on the\nGita Govinda which retains the decorative quality of traditional painting but\nbrings in great sophistication. \n\n \n\nThe country of Halle in GDR has had historical associations with\nIndia, for many of the professors of the Martin Luther University there\nhave been distinguished Indologists.\n\n\nThere is no dogmatic social realism in the exhibition of\ncontemporary art from Halle now on at Rabindra Bhavan.\n\n\nBut there is sensitive reflection of the ambience as also its\nproblems.\n\n\nIf the quietly insinuating urban scenes painted in muted colours\nby Mohwald and Schotte reflect the friendliness of the small town, and the\namused study of a family group by Wagenbritt is still kindly, we see the hard\npsychological closure of a narcissism turned sour in a portrait by Reinel, of\na self that has become a self in opposition to the world in Triebsch.\n\n\nMedieval Christian myth and metaphor return.\n\n\nThere is a superb etching in homage of Grunewald by Sitte,  colour linocut  \" Pain\"  recalls the crucified\nChrist, and the partner of the acrobat walking on a rail in  stark etching  \" Balance\"  could be Death from a medieval\nillustration. \n\n \n\nMore fine graphics.\n\n\nPrints and drawings of Charles Stroh who recently conducted a\ngraphics workshop at Udaipur are on display at the American Center.\n\n\nThe assured technical mastery of Stroh comes out in all the media he\nhandles: pencil and conte, litho, silkscreen.\n\n\nThe sensuous curve of the drawing in the nude studies recalls\nIngres.\n\n\nThere is a whole series of self-portraits where Stroh is\nalternately amused by and reconciled with himself.\n\n\nBut perhaps the creation that would dwell longest in remembrance are\nthe landscapes in litho, of woodlands and quiet nooks where a stream\nbroadens in a shallow basin to become a pool mirroring serene skies. \n\n \n\nSatish  exhibition ( Triveni) is fascinating both\nfor technical and aesthetic reasons.\n\n\nThe works are graphics on canvas, the unit plates themselves large,\nthe composition made far larger by using several of them, the plane of their\nsurface both dug in by deep and soft ground etching and raised up by\ncollaging separate etched metal segments, the final image dispensing with\nmultiple plates and impressions through the use of differential\nviscosity in inking.\n\n\nHis earlier paintings were rapt musings, approaching the mood of the\n haiku  , the miniature poem of the Japanese.\n\n\nGupta has been attracted to that form and has a volume of his verse\nin English modelled on the  haiku  , though the  incredible economy of just seventeen syllables for the whole poem is\nimpossible to achieve in other languages.\n\n\nHere the linkage between poem and visual is clear, especially in a\nwhole series of smaller compositions where Gupta works variations on an\nunheard but sweeter music, the silent flute notes of evocative images based\non his  haiku  :\n\n\n The thief, Left it behind - - The moon at the window. \n    \n\n \n\n\n  Transformed vignettes of nature   <*> line from\nleft to right, column two and three </*>\n\n\n  Exhibitions  / Krishna Chaitanya  <*> line from\nleft to right </*>\n\n \n\n  On   the occasion of the award\nof its Fellowship to Bimal Dasgupta and Radha Mohan, the \" Lalit Kala\nAkademi \" is holding exhibitions of their paintings at Rabindra\nBhavan.\n\n\nIn its first phase,  art was a lyrical homage to\nthe beauty of the earth in watercolour whose transparency and luminosity\ncould seize the immaculate quality of that beauty.\n\n\nLater he turned to oils and acrylics where the main forms of his\ncompositions suggested continental drifts floating in the emerald spreads of\nvast oceans, planets levitating in space.\n\n\nMany vignettes of nature could be discovered here, but subtly\ntransformed and miniaturised as in the images reflected in small mirrors seen\nin the genre paintings of Dutch masters like Jan Van Eyck.\n\n\nBut the overall impact was that of abstract art.\n\n\nPaintings of this type are also on display.\n\n\nBut very recently, he seems to be returning to his first love,\nlandscape.\n\n\nHowever, there is a subtle difference.\n\n\nThe extrovert delight in nature in all the plenitude of details has,\nunder the spell of the simplification involved in abstraction, changed to\nevocation and suggestion, using the resources of poetic connotation.\n\n\nAnd for this kind of endeavour, Dasgupta has rediscovered that his\nfirst medium, watercolour, is still the best. \n\n \n\nA pioneer of Patna and eighty-three today, Radha Mohan has got\nhis Fellowship for reasons which have validity in weighing the varied\ncontributions that go into the growth of traditions, among which the\npurely artistic may not always have had the major role.\n\n\nThe exhibition as well as the publication on his art indicate him\nto be primarily or almost exclusively a portrait painter and some of the\nportraits reveal understanding of character. \n\n \n\nTyeb Mehta ( Art Heritage) has voluntarily chosen the hard\ndiscipline of a very restricted thematic parameter and in spite of the risks\nof either monotony or preciosity in working variations within such\nnarrow options, has managed to create significance every time.\n\n\nSpartan spareness has not had many admirers in history, but Ortega\nhad reminded us that it contributed the austere simplicity of the Doric\norder.\n\n\n approach has a similar patrician reserve and\nauthority.\n\n\nThe ground is monochrome of unmodulated colour.\n\n\nWhen it is divided, the segments are geometrical with clean and\nstraight edges.\n\n\nThe figures too are in monochrome with no tonal gradations.\n\n\nThis kind of palette, especially with the choice of bright yet\nsoothing colours except when explosive contrasts are intended ( as in the\nblood-red mouth of Kali), has a telling impact.\n\n\nThe figure that falls or is truncated by a diagonal cut right through\nthe frame may or may not have reference to the predicament of modern man, but\nthe social reference has no ambiguity whatever in paintings like that of the\n rickshaw-  puller.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7609d8e3-55e7-4709-a120-d6dc8171f1f4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.143158+00:00"}
{"text": "Shri Shahu Chhatrapati  , As A Grand-father\n   \n\n\nDr. V. S. KADAM  Department of History  ,  Shivaji\nUniversity, Kolhapur  . \n\n \n\n Shri  A. B. Latthe in his  ` Memoirs'\n has given a graphic description of the occasion when  Shri\nShahu Chhatrapati  became a grandfather : \n\n \n\n \" His Highness became a grand father at 1-30 p.m. on\nApril 4, 1910, when Her Highness the  Ranisaheb  of Dewas gave\nbirth to a son at Kolhapur.\n\n\nThis joyful news spread all over the town and the public expressed\ntheir joy in various ways.\n\n\n Gudhyas  were erected,  Toranas  were hung and\nseveral dishes of sweetmeats were distributed by various communities in the\ntown.\n\n\nHis Highness, the  Rajasaheb  of Dewas accompanied by\nhis brother  Shrimant  Bhausaheb and others arrived at\nKolhapur on the 8th April, 1910 for celebration of the   Barse\n  Ceremony.\n\n\nThe ceremony of naming the child was performed with great pomp on the\n21st of the same month and the child was named  \" Vikram Sinha\"\n .\n\n\nIn commemoration of this event, all offices and schools were given\na holiday.\n\n\nA few of the prisoners were released and remissions granted to\nothers.\n\n\nThus the Princess of Kolhapur gave to Dewas its heir-apparent and\nbecame herself the mother of another royal house.\"   \n\n \n\nIt would be interesting to know what Shahu  Maharaj\n felt as a grandfather, since it throws, I think significant light\nupon his character, as a person.\n\n\nNaturally, these feelings could be better understood at the time of\nparting, when his grandson was to leave for Dewas from Kolhapur. \n\n \n\nShahu  Maharaj  had taken all the care of his\ngrandson at Kolhapur; he had appointed an English nurse to take care of his\ngrandson.\n\n\n \" I would like to know whether Your Highness will like to\nhave the English nurse for a couple of months\"  , he wrote to his\nson-in-law,  \" Her time will be over in September.\n\n\nIf you do not like to keep her I shall dispense with her services but\nif you want her, a fresh agreement will have to be made with her after\nSeptember.\"   \n\n \n\nShahu  Chhatrapati  was deeply concerned about\nthe health and care of his grandson.\n\n\nHe even showed great concern about the building in which his grandson\nwould stay at Dewas.\n\n\n \" But one thing I can tell you now and that is he must have\nlots of fresh air in the house otherwise he gets bronchitis.\n\n\nYour New Palace or guest house will do or the court house.\n\n\nBut for  sake do not take him to the Old Palace.\"\n  \n\n \n\nIn the next letter he seems to have revised his opinion about the\nNew Palace.\n\n\nHe says,  \" I think court house  is\nthe best house and best ventilated.\n\n\nIs not the part of the New Palace ready ?\n\n\nIf it is just finished it will not do, because the walls give out\ncold and damp.\"   \n\n \n\nHe was painfully aware of the limitations of his daughter in\nbecoming a good mother to his grandson.\n\n\n \" I am sorry to say that the poor child is motherless having\na mother as my daughter who does not know even how to suckle him.\n\n\nIt is neither the fault of the mother nor of the child.\n\n\nIt is  pleasure\"  \n\n\nThis was also an additional factor in his great concern for the\ngrandson. \n\n \n\nHe was ready to send his  \" wife with the grandson for a\nfew days till you are able to arrange confidently.\"  \n\n\nAs a matter of fact he did send his wife.\n\n\n \" I have sent my wife and brother with my grandson.\n\n\nI request Your Highness not to keep my wife more than two weeks.\"\n \n\n\nIn Kolhapur it was the  Ranisaheb  that looked after\nher grandson.\n\n\n \" Not to say much about my wife, you will find from your own\nservants and maid-servants that she hardly sleeps at night.\n\n\nAll the meals of the baby are prepared by her.\"  \n\n\nAnd again,  \" You will be surprised to know that my wife\nserves your child like a nurse.\n\n\nShe does not allow the maid to light   Shegadi \n , for her.\n\n\nShe does it with her own hands that neither smoke nor ashes should\nspoil the milk.\"   \n\n \n\n \" Of course she does it for her own grandson\"  ,\nShahu  Maharaj  continues,  \" but if it was not for a\nson-in-law like you I should not have sent her to Dewas nor as a grandson we\nshould have loved him like this but we love him the more because for having a\nson-in-law like you.\"  \n\n\nShahu    feelings about his\nson-in-law are fully expressed when he says,  \" I look upon you as\nmore than my son.\"  \n\n\nThe    love for his grandson was\nso great that he felt that he should himself bring up the child, but he\nknew that it would not be right since he felt that it was more natural for\nthe child to be brought  up  by its parents.\n\n\nHis love for his grandson was counter-balanced by his respect for the\nfeelings of others, especially his son-in-law.\n\n\nAnd it was the latter that prevailed with him. \n\n \n\n \" With your experience if you find you are unable to take\ncare of the child, with the consent of your wife, you may send the child back\nwith my wife and my daughter, of course, will stop in Dewas as the child\nwon't feel her absence.\n\n\nHe may remain with us until he gets his teeth and he begins to eat\nsolid food.\n\n\nThen we do not want him any more.\n\n\nTeething is the time when we have to be most careful about the child.\n\n\nI think young men are not very particular about children but are so\nof their wives.\n\n\nThe only thing is that I look upon you as more than my son and that\ntherefore you should neither feel shy nor in the least hesitate to send the\nchild back if you feel the slightest difficulty.\"  \n\n\nIn another letter written a few days later, Shahu  Maharaj\n says,  \" Let me assure my dear son-in-law, neither my wife\nnor myself shall feel least sorry if the child remains with you.\n\n\nWe want you to learn to take care of the child.\n\n\nNaturally my wife feels the parting but from her heart she would like\nto see your son with you unless you feel from your heart that she should take\nhim until he gets teeth and eats food.\n\n\nBut if you can take care so much the better.\"  \n\n\nMoreover, in a separate letter written to his brother  he wrote,  \" Don't displease  Rajesaheb  .\n\n\nBe stern with my wife.\n\n\nKeep the child there if  Rajesaheb  wants him.\"\n  \n\n \n\nThe party with the grandson of Shahu  Maharaj \nleft Kolhapur by a special train and immediately he wrote a letter to his\nson-in-law to avoid  \" any tom tom\"  for his wife.\n\n\n \" If you write about procession, I shall be very sorry,\nbecause myself any my wife consider Dewas quite as our house.\n\n\nThat is why we are intruding upon you without being asked for\ninvitation.\"   \n\n \n\nThe simplicity and affectionate nature of Shahu  Maharaj\n and his wife and his dislike of publicity, noted by Sir S. M. Fraser\nalso, are evident from these letters written in\nEnglish. \n\n \n\nThe affection that he felt towards his grandson was immense.\n\n\n \" Let me tell you that if I love in this world anybody more\nthan even myself, my daughter, son or brothers, it is my grandson.\n\n\nHe is very sprightly and always laughing.\"  \n\n\nWhen he received the news of his  arrival at Dewas\nhe wrote to his son-in-law,  \" I hope you are quite pleased with your\nson; he is a very playful boy.\n\n\nJust after your morning meals get him out and let him roll, on the\nbed.\n\n\nThat is the way to enjoy your children.\n\n\nI did the same with my grandson.\n\n\nMy missing him is beyond imagination.\"   \n\n \n\n \" Take care of my grandson.\n\n\nDo not hesitate to send him back if you really think it difficult to\nbring him up.\"  \n\n\nAnd again,  \" I hope you will soon have a second son and this\nlittle child may remain with us.\n\n\nHe is the joy of the family.\"  \n\n\n \n\nShahu  Maharaj  wanted his grandson to be with\nhim in Kolhapur.\n\n\nHis wish was fulfilled partly in future as his grandson Vikramsinh\nwas educated in Rajaram College of Kolhapur and in 1947 succeeded as \nChhatrapati  of Kolhapur.\n\n\nIn addition to understanding Shahu  Chhatrapati  as a\nleader and social revolutionary, it is necessary to understand him as a man.\n\n\nIt is, therefore, I think, necessary to conduct more research in\nsubjects of such nature. \n\n\n  Notes    1.\n\n\nA.

AYER  \n\n \n\nThe 20th century analysts are unanimous in their claim that the\nsubject matter of philosophy is language and its legitimate method is\nanalysis.  1 \n\n\nFor, they conceive that philosophy, unlike other disciplines such as\nBotany, Zoology, Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy etc., does not have any\nsubject matter of its own to deal with.\n\n\nIn order to save philosophy from this rather awkward situation\nanalysts claim that they have assigned a special function to philosophy which\nis a unique feature of philosophy.\n\n\nThe assigned function of philosophy is the logical clarification of\nour everyday language and science.\n\n\nBy analysing the concepts of everyday language and science, analysts\nfelt that the so-called philosophical puzzles can be solved.\n\n\nA.J.Ayer, who was a chief patron of logical positivist movement in\nBritain, holds the view that a philosopher neither does indulge in\nexperimentation nor does he patiently observe the behaviour of any natural\nobjects, yet the statements of a philosopher purport to provide us  `\nknowledge'  which is different from the  ` knowledge'\n of science.\n\n\nThen the question before Ayer was what kind of  ` knowledge'\n does philosophical analysts provide us ?\n\n\nTo put it simply-what then is philosophical analysis ?\n\n\nIn an attempt to answer this question, Ayer maintains that\nphilosophical analysis is concerned with the use and function of language.\n\n\nThis analysis, according to Ayer, attempts to rewrite the sentences\nof everyday language and science in such a way that these sentences exhibit\ntheir proper   \nlogical form; consequently their meaning becomes clear.\n\n\nAs a result of this approach, believes Ayer, the traditional problems\nof philosophy are found to disappear.\n\n\nHe opines that the problems of philosophy appear and reappear due to\nmuddled thinking and this muddled thinking itself is largely the product of\nour improper use of language. \n\n \n\nIn what follow I have made a sincere attempt to show the futility\nof analysis as a method in the aquisition of knowledge of objective reality.\n\n\nIn other words,  notion of philosophy deprives\nphilosophy of its empirical content.\n\n\nIn addition to that  supposition that the sole\nfunction of philosophy is mere analysis of language is not at all convincing\nas philosophy does not confine to one particular subject matter or the other.\n\n\nIn order to accomplish our project, let us examine the views of Ayer\nwith regard to nature and method of philosophy.   I\n\n \n\nTrying to vindicate his claim, namely, the sole function of\nphilosophy is logical analysis of language, Ayer views that philosophy is not\na search for  ` first principles'  .\n\n\nThis is because  ` the foundation of these first principles to\nprovide certain basis for our knowledge, it is clear that they are not to be\nfound among the so-called laws of nature.\n\n\nFor, we shall see that the  ` laws of nature'  , if\nthey are not mere definitions, they are simply hypotheses which may be\nconfuted by experience'  .  2 \n\n\nAyer argues that the  ` first principles'  are not\ndeduced from an intuitively preceived truth upon the basis of which a\nphilosopher proceeds to construct a deductive system.\n\n\nThey are, contends Ayer, no objects of speculative knowledge which\nlie beyond empirical investigation.\n\n\nIf one wants to deduce all knowledge from the  ` first\nprinciples'  without trespassing into  ` metaphysics' \n, then one must take a priori truths as his premises.\n\n\nAnd from one set   of a priori truths (\ntautologies) one can deduce another set of a priori truths.  3 \n\n\nThus, Ayer envisages that it is not possible to deduce all our\nknowledge from the  ` first principles.' \n\n\nIt implies that there is some amount of knowledge that can be derived\nfrom the  ` first principles'  ( a priori truths).\n\n\nThen it is none other than the knowledge of logic and mathematics.\n\n\n \n\nIn the first place,  attack on the view that\nphilosophy is a search for  ` first principles'  can be\nunderstood as an attempt to disapprove Cartesian view-point.\n\n\nFor, Descartes aimed at making philosophy as exact as mathematics.\n\n\nBy virtue of his commitment to this view, Descartes had to look for\nthe  ` first and indubitable'  foundations or principles of\nphilosophy from which a consistent philosophical system can be constructed.\n\n\nIn addition to that, Descartes relied on two important powers of\nhuman reason, namely, intuition and deduction as two main tools of his\ninquiry.\n\n\nAccording to Ayer, the knowledge deduced from such premises cannot\nhave any informative content since one set of analytic truths leads us to\nanother set of analytical truths.\n\n\nHe also maintains that the  ` first principles' \ncannot be found among the so-called  ` laws of nature'  for,\nthe laws of nature can be confuted by experience.\n\n\nConsequently, it is not possible to derive the  ` first\nprinciples'  either from intution or from senseexperiance.\n\n\nWhat is spurious with  notion is that he could not\ndistinguish between the  ` laws of nature'  and mere  `\nstatements of tendency'  .\n\n\nA law is something which does not fail to occur in a given set of\nconditions.\n\n\nLaws of nature are well established scientific truths.\n\n\nThey can neither be verified nor be falsified.\n\n\n main contention is to show that the activity of\nphilosophizing does not involve in the search for  ` first principles'\n What then does this activity of philosophizing consist of?  \n\n \n\nAyer asserts that the activity of philosophizing is essentially\nanalytic.\n\n\nIn support of his assertion Ayer holds that  \" those who are\ncommonly called philosophers have actually been engaged in carrying out\nanalyses.\"   4 \n\n\nNot only that,  \" it can be shown that the majority of those\nwho are commonly supposed to have been great philosophers were primarily not\nmataphysicans but analysts\"  .  5 \n\n\nFrom this it follows that to be a philosopher one needs to be an\nanalyst.\n\n\nApart from that, the greatness of any philosopher lies in his being\nan analyst rather than a speculator.\n\n\nAccordingly, Ayer considers his empiricist predecessors ( Locke,\nBerkeley and Hume) as great.\n\n\nOf Locke and Berkeley, Ayer writes that Locke was not a common-sense\nphilosopher in the sense in which G E. More is a common-sense philosopher.\n\n\nNeither he ( Locke) tried to prove common-sense beliefs on a priori\ngrounds, nor he affirmed or denied the validity of any empirical matter but\nonly analysed them in terms of sense-experience\n\n\nSimilarly, Berkeley was not a metaphysician as he was commonly\nunderstood to be.\n\n\nLike Locke, he too was indulged in analysing the reality of material\nthings.  6  \n\n \n\nAs a matter of fact, Ayer follows the footsteps of his empiricist\npredecessors Berkeley and Hume in reducing the statements about material\nobjects to statements about sense-data.\n\n\nThe phenomenalistic analysis of material objects of Berkeley and\nHume has been converted into linguistic phenomenalism.\n\n\nThe very purpose of this reductionist analysis is to show that the\nexistence of material objects is somehow inferred from the sense-data.\n\n\nWith regard to Hume, Ayer says that Hume is opposed to metaphysics (\ntranscendental kind of metaphysics).\n\n\nIt is only a belief that Hume has put forward the views concerning\nthe nature of philosophical proposition.\n\n\nIn fact, what is considered to be philosophical are his works of\nanalysis.\n\n\nThe whole misunderstanding about  philosophical\nposition is the outcome of his treat  ment of\ncausation that is often misunderstood.  7 \n\n\nAyer himself advocates the same Humean conception.\n\n\nWhile dealing with the nature of causation Ayer writes that  \"\nour conception of causation is the same as his ( Hume's).\"   8\n\n\n\nIn this way Ayer illustrates that the activity of analysis is an\nunique feature of British Empiricists. \n\n \n\nAccording to Ayer, philosopher as an analyst is not concerned\nwith  ` facts'  or  ` notions'  or  `\nthings'  .\n\n\nIn other words, the propositions of philosophy are not factual but\nonly linguistic in their nature.\n\n\nThey express definitions or formal consequences of definitions. \n9 \n\n\nIn this way, Ayer, a professed empiricist, dispences with all\nempirical facts as irrelevant to philosophy.\n\n\nFor him a philosopher is only concerned with the stipulative\ndefinitions of his own inventions.\n\n\nIt is clear from the following passage of Ayer. \n\n \n\nI must say not that I see the cigarette case, if this is to carry\nthe implication that there is a cigarette case there, but it only seems to me\nthat I am seeing it... the next step, continuing our example, is to convert\nthe sentence  ` it now seems to me that I see a cigarette case'\n into  ` I am now seeing a seeming cigarette case  ' \n \n\n\nAnd this seeming cigarette case, which lives only in my present\nexperience, is an example of a sense-datum.  10  \n\n \n\nIndeed, it is in a pickwickian sense, i.e., regardless of their\nactual or literal sense, that  ` facts'  or  ` notions'\n or  ` things'  can be analysed. \n\n \n\nProceeding further, Ayer tries to distinguish philosophy from\nother sciences\n\n\nWith regard to philosophy Ayer holds that philosophy is distinguished\nfrom other arts and sciences not because of its methods but because of its\nsubject matter.\n\n\nPhilosophers utter statements which are intended to be factual but in\nthe final analysis it is realised that they are not the statements  about matters of fact.\n\n\nThe theories of philosophy are not tested by any observation.  11\n\n\n\nWhat follows from the above assertions of Ayer is that the questions\nsuch as whether the material objects are real, whether objects continue to\nexist at times when they are not perceived, cannot be decided on the basis of\nscientific information.\n\n\nAccording to Ayer, these are not the questions which could be settled\nby observation but can be resolved on the basis of analysis of language.\n\n\nTo quote  remarks in this context,  \" What is\nin dispute in such cases is not whether, in a given set of circumstances,\nthis or that event will happen, but rather how anything at all that happens\nis to be described.\"   12 \n\n\nIn short, the activity of philosophical analysis consists in\nproviding definitions. \n\n \n\nRegarding the nature of philosophical analysis, Ayer holds the\nview that the definitions which philosophy provides are not  `\nexplicit definitions'  but  ` definitions in use'  .\n\n\nIn an attempt to illustrate this point, Ayer writes that  \" a\nlexicographer also seeks to give information about the usage of words, but\nthe philosophers differ from him in being concerned... but with the use of\nparticular expressions and whereas the propositions of the lexicographer are\nempirical, philosophical propositions, if they are true, are usually\nanalytic.\"   13 \n\n\nThus a lexicographer is considered to be an empirical scientist who\nglosses antecedent facts, whereas the true propositions of philosophy do not\nexpress anything new but only clarify what is already expressed by the\npropositions.\n\n\nIn short  ` the definitions in use'  show  \"\nhow the sentences in which it ( a symbol) significantly occurs can be\ntranslated into equivalent sentences, which contain neither the definition\nitself nor any of its synonyms\"  .  14 \n\n\nThe very purpose of philosophical analysis, according to Ayer is to\ntranslate certain sentences into their equivalents.\n\n\nFor example, the sentence  ` The round square does not\nexist', is equivalent to  ` No one thing can be both square\nand round'  , and the sentence  ` The author of Waverley  was Scotch  ` is equivalent to'  One\nperson only, wrote Waverley, and that person was Scotch'  .  15\n\n\n\nSusan Stebbing in her review article on  \nLanguage, Truth and Logic  points out that the statement  ` The\nauthor of Waverley was Scotch'  is translated into an equivalent\nstatement or sentence that  ` One person, and one person only wrote\nWaverley and that person was Scotch'  violates the rules of analysis\nprovided by Ayer Stebbing argues that if the word  \" that\"  is\nused referentially, then  \" that person was Scotch\"  is\nequivalent to the whole of the original; and it it is used demonstratively,\nthe defining expression  \" is not a translation of the original at\nall \"  .  16 \n\n\nIn defence of his position against  criticism,\nAyer argues that  \" the object of analysing  ` The author of\nwaverley was Scotch'  is not just to obtain an accurate translation\nof this particular sentence, but to elucidate the use of a whole class of\nexpressions, of which  ` the author of Waverley'  serves\nmerely a typical example\"  .  17 \n\n\nAccording to Ayer, the examples of this kind are only meant to show\nhow certain class of expressions can be explained in our ordinary language.\n\n\nIf a philosopher sticks to this kind of analysis, claims Ayer, he\nwill avoid either interfering in the sphere of natural science or involve\nhimself in metaphysics. \n\n \n\nIn an attempt to define an ambiguous symbol, Ayer states that\n \" a symbol is constituted by signs which are identical with one\nanother in their sensible form, and in their significance, and that a sign is\na sense-content, or a series of sense-contents, which is used to convey\nliteral meaning, is not to say that a symbol is a collection of system of\nsense-contents.\"   18 \n\n\nFrom the above statement of Ayer we can deduce that he is heading for\nreductive analysis'  .\n\n\nEvery symbol is reduced to signs which are identical in their\nsensible form.\n\n\nThis kind of  ` reductive analysis'  as Ayer believes\nis equally applicable to material object state ments.\n\n\nThis is to say that the statement about material objects  can be translated, without residue, into the statements about\nsense-data.\n\n\nAyer presupposes  \" the problem of giving an actual rule for\ntranslating sentences about material things into sentences about\nsense-contents, which may be called the problem of the  ` reduction'\n of material things to sense-contents, is main philosophical part\nof the traditional problem of perception.\"   19 \n\n\nAyer states that the reason for adopting this reductive analysis is\nto eliminate certain problematic entities and to replace them with relatively\nless problematic entities  20 \n\n\nIt implies that the propositions that express the facts of\nordinary perceptual knowledge are not simple, and so are not the ultimate\nconstituents of reality.\n\n\nFor example, the expressions such as  ` table',`chair'\n etc, are problematic in the sense that they are philosophically\ndisputable entities.\n\n\nAnd when the propositions containing such expressions are analysed,\nthen they will be expressed in terms of ultimate constituents of knowledge (\nsense-data).\n\n\nIn other words, the ordinary unanalysed knowledge seems to be about\nsuch things as  ` table',`chairs'  etc., but analysis will\nmake clear the ultimate constituents of knowledge.\n\n\nIn this way, Ayer identifies philosophy with analysis and claims\nthat  \" the only positive contribution that philosophy can make to\nknowledge is in the field of analysis\"  .  21  \n\n \n\nThus Ayer who does not wish to break too finally the\nempiricist tradition could maintain that Berkeley in his analysis of\n ` physical objects'  , Hume in his analysis of causation were\ndoing philosophy as conceived by logical positivists.\n\n\nThe business is still the old reductive analysis ( phenomenalism)\neven if it is under new management.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9b202c58-af34-4c76-a8e5-f8e22827d31d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.146360+00:00"}

Singh announced the  decisiion to\nimplement the Mandal Commission report on August 7, he have rise to criticism\nthat he was guided by the desire to upstage the dismissed Deputy Prime\nMinister Devi Lal, who was busy organising a  rally on\nAugust 9.\n\n\nThat decision, made in utter haste, exposed the populistic\nconsiderations weighing with the Prime Minister.\n\n\nIn the first place, the announcement did not square with the Prime\n oft-declared intention to evolve a consensus on every\nnational issue.\n\n\nAs no political party is against providing reservations for the\ndisadvantaged sections of society, it would not have been difficult for the\nGovernment to hammer out a consensus on the Mandal Commission report.\n\n\nIt was only when a storm of protest had broken out in many States did\nthe Prime Minister drop a hint that he was prepared to make appropriate\nconcessions to the upper castes.\n\n\nOne would like to know what had prevented him from evolving a\nconsensus on the reservation of five to 10 per cent of jobs in the Central\nGovernment and the public sector.\n\n\nThe additional reservation is no more than a sop to the upper castes.\n\n\nThe Prime Minister seems to be very much confused on the subject.\n\n\nOn August 8 - - that is, a day after the announcement of the decision\non the Mandal Commission report - - Mr.V.P. Singh said in the  Rajya\nSabha  , somewhat light-heartedly, that since the poor\nconstituted 40 per cent of the population of India, 40 per cent of the seats\nin the legislatures should be reserved for them.\n\n\nIf he had really pondered over the issue, he would not have made the\nstatement. \n\n \n\nThe point is that the Prime Minister is guided more by political\nexpediency than by anytying else.\n\n\nNow he must be counting on the additional reservation to defuse the\nanti-quota agitations rocking many States.\n\n\nThere is a convention that, when Parliament is in session, all\nimportant decisions of the Government should first be announced in the House.\n\n\nWhen the announcement outside Parliament was objected to by the\nOpposition, the Prime Minister resorted to semantics by saying that what was\nannounced was only a proposal and not a decision.\n\n\nIt is clear that he is in a hell of a hurry to do something to\ncontain the anti-reservation sentiment that is spreading like wild fire.\n\n\nSurely, this is a case of out of the frying-pan into the fire.\n\n\nThe haphazard manner in which the Government is going about\nreservations makes one thing clear: it has no considered stand on the issue.\n\n\n \n\nA solution to the problem seems to lie in a round table to work\nout the modalities of implementing the  Mandal  Commission\nreport, as suggested by BJP leader Atal Behari Vajpayee in Hyderabad the\nother day.\n\n\nThe conference could also consider the additional reservation.\n\n\nThe Prime Minister cannot be unaware of the Supreme Court ruling that\nat no time should the percentage of reservations cross 49.\n\n\nWith the announcement of reservations for backward classes, the job\nquotas have already touched 50 per cent.\n\n\nNow is the time for the Government to strive for a consensus on the\nissue which has already triggered caste feeling in many parts of the country.\n \n\n\n\n\n  Violence in the Valley  \n\n \n\nThat the Kashmiri militants should have stepped up their violent\nactivities soon after the Kupwara incident in which the Pakistani troops\nresorted to heavey artillery shelling against Indian posts is something that\nshould make the Indian leaders sit up and do something to arrest the perilous\ndrift in the valley.\n\n\nThe Pakistan-trained subversives have bombed three bridges on the\nSrinagar-Leh highway near Srinagar.\n\n\nAnd the  jawans  of the Defence \nBorder Road Organisation ( BRO) have become a target for the militants.\n\n\nWith the virtual military take-over in Pakistan, there is a danger of\nthe  \" semi-war\"  between India and Pakistan along the line of\nActual Control in Kashmir escalating into a full-scale armed conflict.\n\n\nThe Kashmiri militants are backed to the hilt by Pakistan, whose\nPresident, Mr. Ghulam Isaq Khan, thinks that the Kashmir issue is the\nunfinished agenda of Partition.\n\n\nHe is playing second fiddle to the all-powerful Pakistani Army,\nwhich, with a civilian mask, is in virtual control of the country.\n\n\nPakistani intervention in Kashmir as well as in Punjab still\ncontinues unchecked.\n\n\nEven during the recent short-lived democratic rule in Pakistan, the\nArmy persisted in orchestrating the communal strife in the two Indian border\nStates.\n Though the deposed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto blandly assured\nIndia that her Government was determined to check infiltration of terrorists\nfrom Pakistan into India, the Army cared two hoots for her assurances.\n\n\nIt is strange that the Pakistan-abetted subversion in the two\ncommunally sensitive States of India should have increased after the change\nof government in India.\n\n\nFrom all this, one cannot help inferring that the political\ndevelopments in India are proving to be an irresistible temptation to the\nPakistani Army, which is believed to abound with many elements loyal to the\nlate President Zia-ul-Haq. \n\n \n\nIndeed, the dismissal of the Benazir Government marks the return\nof Ziaism.\n\n\nThis has grave implications for India because  phased\nplot to plunge Kashmir into communal turmoilnow seems to be at its final\nstage.\n\n\nThis must be the reason why the Army has got rid of the elected\nGovernment and installed in its place a puppet regime.\n\n\nThe military manipulators of political power are undoubtedly spoiling\nfor an armed adventure against India.\n\n\nThis is indicated by the Kupwara clash.\n\n\nTension along the Line of Actual Control is mounting and the\nsubversives from across the border are increasing their attacks on the Indian\nsecurity forces.\n\n\nIf this is viewed against the backdrop of the failure of the two\nrounds of secretary-level talks between the two countries to yield the\nexpected results, one can understand the gravity of the situation along the\nborder.\n\n\nPakistan seems fully prepared for a war over the Kashmir issue.\n\n\nWhich means India should be able to respond to the Pakistani,\nprovocations deterrently and decisively. \n\n \n\nAfter the Kupwara clash, Prime Minister V.P. Singh spoke of a\ngraded response to Pakistani aggravation of tension.\n\n\nBut what the situation calls for is something more than a graded\nreply.\n\n\nThe motive behind  opposition to joint patrolling\nof the border is now staring everbody in the face.\n\n\nIf Pakistani intervention continues, India will be justified in\nresorting to hot pursuit, even if it means waging a war.\n\n\nPakistan has already started such a war.\n\n\nBut the challenge that the militants are posing from within the\nIndian territory exposes the  monumental failure on\nthe political front.\n\n\nThe situation would not have come to the present tragic pass if the\nNational Front Government had refrained from acting vindictively against\nthe Farooq Abdullah Government.  \n\n\n\n\n  Plan accent on small units  \n\n \n\nTHE National Development Council ( NDC) has put its seal of\napproval on the approach paper to the Eighth Plan, the main thrust of which\nis the removal of poverty and unemployment.\n\n\nDevelopment of small and tiny industries with an enlarged list of\nreserved items will be an important component of the strategy for generation\nof employment.\n\n\nThis objective is fully in consonance with the National Front  commitment to make the right to work a Fundamental Right.\n\n\nEmployment generation is the one area where the new Government can\ndemonstrate its economic dynamism.\n\n\nMost of the participants in the NDC meeting called for an increase in\nthe opportunities for self-employment.\n\n\nThe scope for such employment is vast in the rapidly expanding\nsmall-scale sector.\n\n\nThe total investment in the small-scale sector is expected to\nincrease to 30,000  crores  in 1994-95 from  Rs.\n 17,015  crores  at the end of the Seventh Plan.\n\n\nThis level of investment, according to a study made by the Federation\nof Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry ( FICCI), will provide jobs to\n6.1 million persons by the end of the Eighth Plan against the employment of\n3.4 million at the end of the Seventh Plan.\n\n\nThe net addition to employment during the next Plan period will be of\nthe order of 2.7 million.\n\n\nIt is now realised by all concerned that the promotion and dispersal\nof small industrial units will go a long way in solving the unemployment\nproblem.\n\n\nBut this sector is afflicted with many infirmities.\n\n\nIt is more vulnerable than the medium and major sectors to what is\nknown as sickness, which is mainly attributable to the non-availability of\nworking capital when it is needed most.\n\n\nPleading with the Central Government to take a fresh look at the\nentire gamut of problemes faced by the small and medium sectors, the\nAll-India  Association ( AIMO) has suggested waiver of\nthe huge accumulated interest payable by 1.5  lakh  units in\nthe two sectors.\n\n\nSuch a step, AIMO feels, will provide employment to about 45 \nlakh  persons immediately. \n\n \n\nConsolidation of the progress already made in the small sector\nshiould be one of the aims of the strategy outlined in the Eighth Plan.\n\n\nIn other words, consolidation and expansion should go hand in\nhand.\n\n\nRealising the employment-generating potential of this sector, the\nprevious Union Government brought in legislation for the establishment of the\nSmall Industries Development Bank of India ( SIDBI).\n\n\nThe Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Industrial Bank of India (\nIDBI), began its operations about two months ago.\n\n\nOne is confident that the SIDBI will play a major role in promoting\nand strengthening the small and tiny units.\n\n\nMarketing continues to be one of the serious problems.\n\n\nAnd that problem needs the special attention of the Government,\nboth at the Centre and in the States.\n\n\nOne complaint that is common to most small entrepreneurs is that the\nmarketing tie-ups agreed to at the time of starting their units are not\nproperly adhered to by the Government dpartments and other\nquasi-governmental organisations.\n\n\nAdded to this is the short-shrift given to the products of the small\nsector in the Southern States by the Directorate General of Supplies and\nDisposals. \n\n \n\nThere is urgent need for the Central Government undertakings to\nrectify the regional imbalances in the quantum of purchases made by them from\nthe small secotr.\n\n\nAs most of the small entrepreneurs are self-employed, the Government\nis under an obligation to help them market their products.\n\n\nOtherwise, it would be guilty of leaving them in the lurch.\n\n\nIt would be too much to expect the small and struggling units to\ncompete with the well-established medium and major industries.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5362752a-a762-4986-9f50-cdf9cbb50511", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.148837+00:00"}
{"text": "Impact of Ca and SO4 on pH of Rain Water in Rural\nEnvironments in India   \n\n\n P. S. Prakasa Rao, G.A. Momin, P.D. Safai, A.G. Pillai, M.S.\nNaik and L.T. Khemani   Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology,\nPune  - 411 008  \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nIt is believed that there is no single natural pH of precipitation\napplicable to the whole globe, but rather several natural values, each unique\nto a region the size of a continent or an ocean.\n\n\nHence, the natural pH of rain water in rural areas in India will\nalso depend upon the geographical location of the observational site.\n\n\nThe dust load in the atmosphere over the northwest parts of India is\nsignificantly higher than that over the eastern parts.\n\n\nIt is reported that the dust particles are potentially basic in nature\nwhich can neutralize the H ion concentration and maintain the pH in the\nalkaline range.\n\n\nHowever, the extent to which the air-borne dust influences the\nchemistry of rain water in certain geographical regions varies with its\ncomposition and abundance.\n\n\nIn view of the above, the rain water samples were collected at two\nrural locations namely, \" Muktsar \" in Punjab ( NW India )\nand \" Goraur \" in Bihar ( NE India ) where there is a\nsignificant difference in the concentrations ot total suspended\nparticulates.\n\n\nThe rain water samples, collected simultaneously during the monsoon\nseason of 1988, were analysed for major cations and anions.\n\n\nThe influence of individual ions on pH of rain water has been\nidentified and the reasons for the variations in pH at the two locations\nare discussed. \n\n\n  SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS  \n\n \n\nRain water samples were collected at two locations namely,\nMuktsar and Goraur during the monsoon season of 1988.\n\n\nSamples were collected by using stainless steel funnels of 30 cm\ndiameter fitted on 10 lit capacity polyethylene bottles previously rinsed\nwith double distilled water.\n\n\nThe duration of each sample was 24 h.\n\n\nThe funnels were washed twice daily in the morning and evening to\navoid dry deposition.\n\n\nHowever, contamination due to dry deposition cannot be completely\nruled out.\n\n\nThe two sampling locations are representative of rural\nenvironments since there are no local pollution sources.\n\n\nAll rain water samples were filtered through Whatman - - 41 filter\npaper and refrigerated at 4<*>degrees</*>C in laboratory until all the ionic\ncomponents were analysed.\n\n\nThe samples were analysed for major anions ( CI, SO4 and\nNO3 ) and cation ( NH4, Na, K, Ca and Mg ) .\n\n\nThe concentrations of CI, SO4, NO4, and\nNH4 were determined by using standard colorimetric methods (\nKhemani  et al.,  1985 ) , and those of metallic components by using\natomic absorption spectrophotometer ( Perkin-Elmer, model 373 ) .\n\n\nAlso, the pH was measured with a digital pH meter.\n\n\nThe pH data in the present study are interpreted in the light of\nCO2 - - equilibrated value ( pH = 6.65 ) , though it may not be a\nreal atmospheric background value. \n\n\n  RESULT AND DlSCUSSION  \n\n\n  Chemical composition of rain water  \n\n \n\nThe average seasonal concentrations in mg / l of major anions\nand cations along with pH values in the rain water collected at the two\nlocations are given in table 1.\n\n\nAs the measurements include the major anions and cations, their ratio\nvalue should be 1.0.\n\n\nBut it varied from 0.84 to 1.20 at \" Muktsar \" and\nfrom 0.80 to 1.4 at \" Goraur \" .\n\n\nThe possible reasons for such deviations have been mentioned by\nMunger ( 1982 ) .\n\n\nThe total mineralization in rain water at \" Muktsar\n\" was 18.52 mg / l, whereas at Goraur it was only 5.67 mg / l.\n\n\nThe high mineralization at \" Muktsar \" was mainly\ndue to high concentration of cations, especially Ca, which is mostly\noriginated from oil.\n\n\nThe high concentration of sea salt ( Na and Cl ) at \" Muktsar\n\" is puzzling and requires explanation.\n\n\nIt is suggested that the excess sea salt at \" Muktsar\n\" might be transported from the \" Loni salt basin \"\n, situated upwind in Rajasthan, by the prevailing south westerly winds\nduring the monsoon season.\n\n\nCa and NO3 the dominant ions in the rain water at \"\nMuktsar \" .\n\n\nBut \" Goraur \" , the dominant ions were Ca and\nSO4.\n\n\nSO4 and NO3 in atmosphere are mostly released from\nthe  anthropogenic sources and are responsible for\nreducing the pH of rain water.\n\n\nWhereas, the alkaline components ( Ca, K and Mg ) neutralise the H\nions and increase the pH of rain water.\n\n\nThe high concentration of NO3 at \" Muktsar\n\" has not decreased the pH.\n\n\nHence, most of the nitrates are in the form of salts rather than\nacids.\n\n\nAlso, most of the nitrates seem to be released from the soil since it\nhas shown good correlation with oriented elements ( Ca, K and mg ) . \n\n \n\nThe average concentration of SO4 at \" Muktsar\n\" is slightly higher than the world background value ( 1.1 mg / l ) .\n\n\nThe concentration of Ca is about 3 times higher than that of\nSO4 at \" Muktsar \" .\n\n\nThe acidic effects, caused due to SO4 are neutralised by the\nhigh concentrations of ca and other alkaline ionic components.\n\n\nTherefore, the excess cations which are of alkaline nature are\nmainly responsible for the observed high alkaline pH in rain water at\n\" Muktsar \" .\n\n\nThe influence of sea salt on rain water at \" Goraur\n\" was minimum, since the location is far away from the nearby\ncoast.\n\n\nIt is known that the concentration of sea salt in rain water\ndecreases with increase of distance from the sea.\n\n\nThe low concentrations of the soil oriented components ( Ca, K and Mg )\nat \" Goraur \" indicates the minimum influence of dust\nparticles in the atmosphere on rain water chemistry.\n\n\nAlthough the concentration of SO4 is not so high at\n\" Goraur \" ,    yet   the pH is\nslightly acidic ( 5.30 ) which is nearer to the CO2 - -\nequilibrated value.\n\n\nHence, the main cause for the observed acidic pH of rain water at\nGoraur is the low concentrations of soil oriented elements.\n\n\nsimilar results have been reported for the five world background\nstations which are having no influence of soil and authropogenic sources (\nGalloway  et al.,  1982 ) . \n\n\n  Ca / SO4 ratio  \n\n Khemani  et al.  ( 1987 ) have suggested that the ratio of Ca to\nSO4 can serve as a significant parameter for identifying the\nacidity and alkalinity in precipitation.\n\n\nIf the ratio value is more than unity, the precipitation will be\nalkaline and if the ratio value is less than unity, the precipitation will be\nacidic.\n\n\nTo verify this hypothesis, the ratio values ( Ca / SO4 )\nwere calculated for rain water collected at the two locations.\n\n\nThe average ratio value of Ca / SO4 at \" Muktsar\n\" was more than unity ( 3.5 ) showing alkalinity in rain water,\nwhereas at \" Goraur \" , it was less than unity ( 0.83 )\nshowing acidity in rain water. \n\n\n  Influence of ionic components on pH  \n\n \n\nTo verify the influence of individual ions on the pH of rain\nwater, the rainy days at \" Goraur \" have been classified\ninto three categories, namely, ( 1) pH<*>smaller than</*>5, ( 2) 5<*>equal to\nor less than<*></*>pH<*>equal to or less than</*>6, ( 3) pH<*>greater\nthan</*>6.\n\n\nThe number of samples in the three categories were 8, 5 and 21\nrespectively.\n\n\nHowever such categorisation could not be made in the case of\n\" Muktsar \" since all the pH values are greater than 6.0.\n\n\nThe mean concentrations in <*> mu</*>eq / 1 of major anions and\ncations are presented in figure 1 for each of the three categories mentioned\nabove.\n\n\nThe SO4 concentration was the highest in the acidic category\nand the lowest in the alkaline category, whereas, the Ca concentration was\nthe lowest in the acidic category and the highest in the alkaline category.\n\n\nSimilar pattern was also observed in case of K, Mg and NH4.\n\n\nHowever, Cl and Na did not show any variation among the three\ncategories.\n\n\nThe concentration of NO3 in first category was lower than\nthat in the other two categories.\n\n\nHence, SO4 and Ca ions seem to be important among all\nmeasured ions to influence the pH of rain water.\n\n\nThe concentration of SO4 in the first category is\nimportant for the acidity of precipitation, while the SO4\nconcentration in the remaining categories is more important for the\nalkalinity of precipitation.\n\n\nThis indicates the contribution of mixed sources containing\nsulphur compounds associated with acidic or basic compounds.\n\n\nHowever, Ca concentration in all the categories is important for the\nalkalinity of precipitation.\n\n\nSince, the buffering capacity of Ca is very    much limited, it may not be able to\nneutralize the high concentration of H ions produced by acidic components (\nSO4 and NO3 ) .   \n\n\n  CONCLUSION  \n\n \n\nIn view of this study, it is concluded that there will be many\nnatural background pH values, each depending on the geographical location\nand soil condition of the region.\n\n\nHence, the interpretation of the acid rain in a region should be made\nwith respect to its background pH value. \n\n\n  REFERENCE  \n\n\nGalloway, J.N., G.E.

Nagaratnam   Defence Metallurgical Research\nLaboratory, Hyderabad  - 500 258\n\n \n\n In the nuclear energy field, the consciousness of safety,\nthe planning of facilities and operations to ensure safety, the methods for\nmonitoring to ensure compliance with safety standards, as well as the record\nof safety have been of a very high standard, in contrast to the situation\nwith respect to control of hazards from chemical pollutants.\n\n\nThe philosophy, methodologies and the data bases that the radiation\nprotection community has evolved are of great relevance and applicability in\nthe wider context of environmental protection, public health and industrial\nsafety  .   \n\n\n  Introduction  \n\n \n\nMankind is reaping immense benefits from the application of\nnuclear energy in various fields - - power production, medicine, industry,\nagriculture and research.\n\n\nWe know that any facet of human advance involves acceptance of some\nrisk, and radiation is no exception.\n\n\nWe have to balance risks vs benefits and arrive at an optimum\nsolution.\n\n\nIn the nuclear energy field, the consciousness of safety, the\nplanning of facilities and operations to ensure safety, the constant\nreview and updating of risk estimates in the light of newer knowledge, the\nmethods for monitoring to ensure compliance with safety standards, as well\nas the record of safety are unparalled, Chernobyl notwithstanding.\n\n\nIn contrast, the situation with respect to control of hazards from\nchemical pollutants is grim.\n\n\nBhopal was the worst industrial disaster in history, but it is clear\nthat we have learnt very little from \" Bhopal \" in terms of\ncorrective measures that have been instituted by the chemical industry\ncommunity anywhere in the world.\n\n\nThe response of nuclear experts to Chernobyl stands in refreshing\ncontrast. \n\n \n\nThe philosophy, methodologies, techniques and the data bases that\nthe radiation protection community has evolved are of great relevance in the\nwider context of \" environmental protection \" , \"\npublic health \" and \" industrial safety \" .\n\n\nWhereas we have extensive knowledge on the long-term effects of\nlow level ionizing radiation, there is very little corresponding\ninformation for the thousands of chemicals in extensive use.\n\n\nGenerally the immediate toxic effects are those that determine the\nsetting of limits ( like TLV ) for chemicals.\n\n\nBecause of this wide difference in our knowledge in the two cases,\nattempts have been made to equate the hazardous effects of chemicals in\nterms of a unit called \" REC \" , radiation equivalent\nchemical. \n\n\n  INPUTS TOWARDS SAFETY IN NUCLEAR ENERGY APPLICATIONS\n \n\n \n\nAround 10 - 15 % of the total capital costs of major systems like\na nuclear power plant go towards safety features such as shields and\nstacks.\n\n\nSimilarly around 5 - 10 % of running costs and manpower are devoted\nto safety maintenance, whether it is a major activity like operating a\nnuclear reactor or a much smaller activity like running a radiotherapy or\nnuclear medicine department.\n\n\nIn this connection it is instructive to have a look at the figures\nfor our nuclear energy activities.\n\n\nThe data have been kindly supplied by Sri S.D. Soman, Director,\nHealth and Safety Group, BARC ( Soman, 1988 ) .\n\n\nWe have around 34,000 radiation workers ( 12,300 in the\nestablishments of the Department of Atomic Energy and 21,500 in non-DAE\nestablishments, mainly in diagnostic X-ray departments and other medical\napplications as well as some industrial and research application areas ) .\n\n\nThere are around 820 scientific staff in DAE who are dedicated to\nlooking after the safety of these workers, giving a figure of one safety\nperson per 41 radiation workers.\n\n\nIn fact, around 45 % of these workers do not get any radiation dose\nat all.\n\n\nIf this is taken into account, there is one safety person per 23\nworkers with non-zero dose.\n\n\nThe annual per capita expenditure on the safety of each radiation\nworker getting non-zero dose is Rs.  2660/-. \n\n\n  THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY ( IAEA )\n \n\n \n\n\" IAEA \" has brought out so far around 1150\npublications.\n\n\nOut of these 28 % are listed directly under the heading  `\nnuclear safety and environmental protection'  .\n\n\nAnother 3 % deals with  ` radiation biology, dosimetry and\npollution studies'  , which are directly concerned with protection.\n\n\nIn addition, another 8 % is concerned with  ` reactor control\ninstrumentation, reliability, inspection and quality assurance' \nwhich have a direct bearing on safety.\n\n\nThus around 40 % of the total publications deal with safety.\n\n\nIs there a similar parallel in any of the other industries or\noccupations ?\n\n\nThe International Nuclear Information System ( INIS ) is\ncomprehensive, systematically organised and standardised.\n\n\nInformation retrieval with respect to any aspect of nuclear energy is\neasy and quick.\n\n\nFor example, full details of alI power and research reactors all over\nthe world are available at one place.\n\n\nCan we hope to get information at short notice about any of the\nchemical plants that are potentially hazardous, say, those producing\npesticides ?\n\n\nIn 1974 \" IAEA \" initiated a programme on Nuclear\nPower Plant Safety Standards ( NUSS ) , which today consist of 5 Codes of\nPractice and 60 Guides giving procedures for implementing the Codes. \n\n \n\nAter the 3 mile Island accident in 1979  safety programme was reviewed, and in 1981 a separate\nDivision of Nuclear Safety was established.\n\n\nSeveral elements were added, including Operational Safety Review\nTeams ( OSART ) , the Incident Reporting System ( IRS ) , and an\nInternational Nuclear Safety Advisory Group ( INSAG ) .\n\n\n\" IAEA \" seeks to promote emergency planning and\npreparedness.\n\n\nGuidelines were developed in 1984 for mutual emergency assistance.\n\n\nIn 1985 a Radiation Protection Advisory Team ( RAPAT ) was\nestablished to deal with non-power applications of nuclear energy.\n\n\nWhat about Chernobyl ?\n\n\nThe international nuclear community was partially prepared even\nbefore the accident for managing an event like Chernobyl.\n\n\nImmediately after the accident \" IAEA \" received\ninformation on fallout levels from various countries and helped to a\ncertain extent in the dissemination of information.\n\n\nBut, in the overall context, as Hans Blix, the Director-General\nof \" IAEA \" handsomely admits, important elements\nwere missing in a viable international safety regime ( Blix, 1987 ) .\n\n\nBut \" IAEA \" has not spared any effort to learn from\nChernobyl and has expeditiously taken all appropriate corrective measures.\n\n\nWithin a month of the accident, texts of two conventions, namely\nearly notification convention and convention on assistance in the event of a\nnuclear accident or radiological emergency, were adopted.\n\n\nThe weak links in the chain were identified and action taken by\nthe \" IAEA \" for better information exchange, man-machine\ninterface, operator qualifications, international accreditation of\ntraining programmes, fire protection, medical judgement, and biological\ndosimetry. \n\n\n  \" lCRP \" PHlLOSOPHY AND METHODOLOGIES\n \n\n \n\nThe International Commission on Radiological Protection ( ICRP )\nmakes periodic recommendations on all aspects of radiological protection.\n\n\nAlthough it is only an Advisory Body, its recommendations have been\nunanimously accepted by each and every country in the world, as well as by\ninternational organisations like \" WHO \" , \" FAO\n\" , \" ILO \" and \" IAEA \" .\n\n\n\" lCRP \" has brought out so far 55 publications\nrunning into about 7000 pages.\n\n\n policy is to consider the\nfundamental principles upon which radiation protection measures can be\nbased.\n\n\nBecause of the differing conditions that apply in various\ncountries, detailed guidelines on the applications of its\nrecommendations, either in regulations or codes of practice, are to be\nelaborated by the appropriate national or international bodies.\n\n\nFor this reason,  recommendations\nprovide a degree of flexibility.\n\n\n\" ICRP \" defines the objective of radiation\nprotection as follows :  ` Radiation protection is concerned with the\nprotection of individuals, their progeny, and mankind as a whole, while still\nallowing necessary activities from which radiation exposure might result.'\n\n\n\nThe level of safety required for the protection of humans is thought\nlikely to be adequate to protect other species as well. \n\n\n  Detrimental effects against which protection is required\n \n\n \n\nThe detrimental effects against which protection is required are\nSomatic and Hereditary.\n\n\nSomatic effects become manifest in the exposed individual himself and\nhereditary effects affect his descendents.\n\n\n\" ICRP \" makes a distinction between stochastic and\nnon-stochastic effects.\n\n\nNon-stochastic effects are those for which the severity of the effect\nvaries with the dose, and for which there is likely to be a threshold  dose below which no detrimental effects are seen.\n\n\nExamples are cataract, damage to bone marrow leading to blood\ndeficiencies ( like anaemia ) , impaired fertility, etc. \n\n \n\nStochastic effects are those for which the probability of an\neffect occurring, rather than its severity, is a function of the dose.\n\n\nTo be on the safe side it is conservatively assumed that stochastic\neffects have no threshold; even the smallest dose does have a probability of\nproducing the effect.\n\n\nCancer induction and hereditary effects are the major causes of\nconcern in stochastic effects.\n\n\nTo illustrate the nature of the stochastic effect, we may notice\nthat when a person gets leukaemia as a result of radiation exposure,\nwhether he gets the disease from a dose of 100 rem or 200 rem is immaterial;\nthe disease is going to run the same serious course.\n\n\nAll that one can say is that the probability of getting leukaemia\nfrom an exposure of 100 rem is less than that from an exposure to 200 rem.\n\n\nIt is worth noting that even in the case of chemicals we should\nlegitimately make this distinction between stochastic and\nnon-stochastic effects, but this is not explicitly done. \n\n\n  Aim of radiation protection  \n\n \n\nThe aim of radiation protection is to prevent non-stochastic\neffects and to limit the probability of stochastic effects to levels deemed\nto be acceptable.\n\n\nNon-stochastic effects can be prevented by setting the dose limits at\nsufficiently low values so that the threshold dose would not be reached, even\nfollowing exposure for the whole of a lifetime ( for members of the\npublic ) or for the total period of working life ( in the case of\noccupational exposure ) .\n\n\nThe limitation of stochastic effects is dealt with later. ) ICRP\npublication 26, brought out in 1977, is an epoch-making document.\n\n\n( It is likely to undergo a major revision in 1990. )\n\n\nIt recommends a system of protection whose philosophy and\nmethodologies have profound implications in all areas of risk management (\n\" ICRP \" , 1977a ) . \n\n\n  System of dose limitation  \n\n\nThis has 3 components, namely \" Justification \" ,\n\" Optimisation \" , and \" Dose limitation\n\" .\n\n \n\n Justification : \n\n\nNo practice shall be adopted unless its introduction produces a\npositive net benefit.\n\n\n( This implies a cost-benefit analysis. ) \n\n \n\n Optimisation ( ALARA ) : \n\n\nAll exposures shall be kept as low as reasonably achievable, economic\nand social factors being taken into account.\n\n\nThis is the famous ALARA principle.\n\n\n( It implies a differential cost-benefit analysis. ) \n\n \n\n Dose limitation : \n\n\nDoses to individuals shall not exceed the prescribed limits.\n\n\n( This is the overriding clause.\n\n\nIt is intended to ensure that the risk to any individual does not\nexceed acceptable limits, even if the practice might have been justified.\n\n\n\" ALARA has \" to be applied subject to this\nlimitation on individual dose ) . \n\n \n\nThe concepts of justification and Optimisation have been\nelaborately developed by  \" ICRP \" and guidelines have\nbeen provided for applying them in a variety of practical cases.\n\n\nA parameter used for optimisation is the collective dose, which is\nthe product of the number of persons exposed in a group multiplied by the\naverage dose to this group.\n\n\nIt is a measure of the total health detriment to the population as a\nwhole and of the burden on society that this detriment will impose ( say,\nin terms of hospitalisation facilities or economic expenditure ) .\n\n\nThis parameter is of applicability to chemical pollutants as well.\n\n\n\n  Categories of exposure  \n\n \n\n\" ICRP \" distinguishes between controllable and\nnon-controllable exposures.\n\n\nIn the former case, the occurrence of the exposure is foreseen and\ncan be limited by control of the source and development of satisfactory\noperating procedures.\n\n\nln the case of uncontrollable exposures ( as in the case of\naccidents ) , the exposure is not subject to control, so that subsequent\nexposure can be limited, if at all, only by remedial action.\n\n\nSince remedial action itself ( for example evacuation, denial of\ncertain areas or contaminated foodstuffs for a time period ) may interfere\nseverely with normal activities, impose a social or economic burden, and in\ncertain cases pose its own hazards, the type of remedial action should be\nplanned on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis. ( Paractical guidelines for\nspecific situations are given by \" ICRP \" . ) \n\n \n\n\" ICRP \" has developed to a high degree of\nsophistication probabilistic risk assessment methodologies.\n\n\nOther institutions in the nuclear field have also devoted\nconsiderable attention to risk assessment; as an important example may be\nmentioned the \" Event-Tree \" and \" Fault-Tree\nAnalysis \" extensively developed for assessment of reactor safety in\nthe monumental  monograph brought out in 1976 in\nUSA and usually referred to as the \" Rasmussen Report \" or\n\" WASH-1400 \" .\n\n\n\" ICRP \" also makes a distinction between\noccupational exposure and exposure of a member of the public.\n\n\nThe former is characterised by involving a small number of persons,\nwho will be adults above the age of 18, with a knowledge of radiation hazards\nand protective measures, taking up the occupation willingly, and under strict\nhealth physics and medical surveillance.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the members of the public comprise a much larger\npopulation, including radiosensitive groups like children and pregnant\nwomen and women of reproductive capacity, not capable of strict supervision,\nand generally not benefiting from the radiation exposure.\n\n\nHence different dose limits are prescribed in the two cases.\n\n\nIt is obvious that such a distinction applies in the case of\nchemical pollutants as well.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "dddc8da7-95a8-4a37-a4b5-e439d1b7e8c1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.150892+00:00"}
{"text": "OMAR  CRITICISM OF LIFE    \n\n \n\nOmar khayyam was born in the latter half of the 11th century and\ndied in the first quarter of the 12th.\n\n\nFor a man of the 11th century, Khayyam is strangely modern.\n\n\nHe was a scientist of no ordinary worth of distinction.\n\n\nHis work entitled  \" Algebra \"  was translated into\nsome of the European languages.\n\n\nAs an astronomer he was amongst the foremost of the Middle Ages and\nthe Christian calendar of the present day owes much of its perfection to\nhis labours.\n\n\nNot satisfied with being a scientist, he wanted to be a philosopher -\n- the solver of  mighty riddle - - with disastrous results to\nhis peace of mind. \n\n \n\n  \" Up from  centre through the Seventh\ngate I rose and on the throne of Saturn sate and many a knot unravelled by\nthe Road; but not the master - knot of Human death and fate.\n\n\nThere was the door to which I found no key  . \" \n\n\nHe was too naughty a spirit to find consolation in faith and\nresignation, the unfailing resources of the meek and humble.\n\n\nSupremely endowed with courage and audacity, he did battle with\nthe orthodoxy of his days.\n\n\nHe sneered at the mystical  Sufis  as a loquacious\nlot.\n\n\nHe was not given the Robe of Honour, which his genious deserved.\n\n\nHe laughs, saying that it could only be purchased by bartering away\nhis freedom of thought; certainly He is the richer by keeping the more\nprecious stuff for himself.\n\n\nLike Mill and Morley of contemporary history, he was a sage and\nsceptic rolled into one.\n\n\nHigh office did not tempt him.\n\n\nHe preferred instead a pension coupled with the pleasures and\npursuits of private life. \n\n \n\nThe thoughts and feelings he expresses are astonishingly and\nsurprisingly modern.\n\n\nThere is not a single writer of the Middle Ages who has caught the\nfancy of the present day in such a close and mighty grip as Omar.\n\n\nOne may not like him - - his views may be abhorrent to you - - but if\nthere is any the least spark of serious intellectual purpose in your life\nhe seizes on your attention.\n\n\nHe has the glittering eye of the Ancient Mariner and fascinates\nwhile perturbing the guest bent on attending the feast of faith.\n\n\n rendering of the  Rubaiyat\n has become a classic - - a leading classic in the literature of\nrevolt - - of revolt against accepted doctrines of human worth and destiny.\n \n\n \n\nKhayyam can never become obsolete because the theme of his song\nbelongs to the eternal element in the heart.\n\n\nFeeling minds and thinking heads will ask these questions.\n\n\n \" What is truth? said jesting Pilate and would not stay for\nan answer\"  .\n\n\nProbably    he   knew it was no use waiting\nfor an answer.\n\n\nBut Pilate has left plenty of successors, more patient than he, and\nin consequence more miserable. \n\n \n\nI shall briefly summarise the considerations that led Omar to\ndeny the divine ordering of the world : \n\n\n  1. Intellectual despair  \n\n \n\nIn his youth he frequented doctor and saint and heard great\nargument about it.\n\n\n ( It never is, on it I am afraid ) but every more came out by\nthe same door as I went in  .\n\n\nGreat scientist as he was, he found it easier to solve the riddle\nof the material world rather than the spiritual.\n\n\nTo his questioning there came not answer from the world without,\nnor yet from the world within.\n\n\n  \" And I heard, as from without, the Me within thee is\nblind\"   .\n\n\nWhat then were the questions that perplexed him ?  \n\n\n  \" Into this Universe and why not knowing Nor whence,\nlike water willy nilly flowing And out of it, as wind along the waste I know\nnot whither willy-nilly blowing.\"    \n\n \n\nMoreover he asks, \" Was I consulted by the Power that\nthus arrogated to itself the function of disposing my destinies?\n\"  \n\n\n   \"  What without asking, hither hurried whence ?\n\n\nAnd without asking, whither hurried hence !\n\n\nDespair is own cousin to blind fury and rage\"    \n\n \n\nHe adds :  \n\n\n  \" In many a cup of this forbidden wine\n\n\nMust drown the memory of that insolence\"  .  \n\n \n\n  \"  Shall I seek for tempral good or for eternal\nhappiness ? the answer is the same to both : your reward is neither here nor\nthere.\"  \n\n \n\nIt will be observed that Omar parts company with Kantian ethics\nand the generally accepted theological views.\n\n\nAccording to these ethical codes imperfection pertains only to this\nworld, and strangely enough, it is a fine reason for believing in the\nexistence and perfection of a heavenly kingdom.\n\n\nThe answer of Omar is clear though rude.\n\n\nHe asks  \" Who made this world? \" \n\n\nIn his parable of the pot and the potter he makes one of the pots\nsay.  \n\n\n  \" They sneer at me for leaving all things awry \n\n\nWhy did the hand then of the potter shake\"  . \n\n \n\nIf the hand shook in making this world, why should we suppose it\nto have been steady in making that other world ? \n\n \n\nThe results is he gives up asking these questions.  \n\n\n  \"  no more with human or divine\n\n\n tangle to the winds resign\"  . \n\n \n\nThis is more often attempted than achieved.\n\n\nIn point of fact he did worry himself with problems which were most\nheart-breaking.  \n\n \n\nWe have already seen that Omar khayyam was alive to the problem\nof evil - - more especially as a wrong and injustice done to his own\npersonality.\n\n\nLook, he says, how all is vanity !  \n\n\n  \" You know how little while we have to stay\n\n\nAnd once departed may return no more\" <*> dotted line</*> \n\n\n  \"  The leaves of life keep falling one by one\"\n .  \n\n \n\nIt is argued that life is endless and persistent in its\nmanifestations: what then ?  \n\n\n  \" Each morn a thousand roses brings, you say\n\n\nyes, but where leaves the Rose of yesterday?\"  <*> dotted\nline</*>\n\n\nAh ! in the dust, dry, withered !  \n\n \n\nMoreover such is life, that no one wants to be reborn here.\n\n\nIt is a sufficient verdict on its loathsome futility: Both the\ngood and the bad.  \n\n\n  \" Alike to no such aureate earth are turned\n\n\nAs buried once, men want dug up again\"  .  \n\n \n\nYou may have been a hero, but once dead, what is left of you ?\n\n\nShakespeare dwelt gloomily on the probability of Imperial Caesar dead\nand turned to clay being utilised by a most prosale housewife for stopping a\nchink in the wall.\n\n\nIn similar strain sings Omar.  \n\n\n  \" The wild ass stamps over his head\n\n\nBut cannot break his sleep\"   \n\n \n\nToo poor to resent even assinine indignities.\n\n\nOur friends are dead and ( we ) ourselves that once enjoyed with them\nand now sorrow for them must go too !\n\n\nDust to dust and under to lie oh ! the despair of the man.  \n\n\n Oh ! Thou who man of baser earth didst make\n\n\nAnd even with paradise divine the snake\n\n\nFor all the sin wherewith the face of man\n\n\nIs blackened - -  forgiveness give and take.  \n\n \n\nIt is the man of shallow sense and morbid impulses that looks on\na revolt like this as the result of pride or frivolity.\n\n\nThere is in it as fine and deep a feeling of moral obligation and as\nprofound an insight into moral worth as was displayed by the saints of sacred\ncalendars, by a St. Francis or a Buddha. \n\n \n\nPovidence being out of the question, what else is there to\nafford us a rational ground of explanation ?\n\n\nDestiny, hard, cold, inevitable and inexorable - - a view not\ndissimilar to that propounded by Lucretius and accepted by the science of\ntoday as the only possible hypothesis.  \n\n\n  \" The moving finger writes and having writ moves on,\n\n\nNor all your piety nor with shall lure it back to cancel half a line.\n\n\nNor all your tears wash out a word of it\"  .  \n\n \n\nThe only religion that wholeheartedly accepts the supremacy of\nnatural law is Himduism.\n\n\nPantheism has its insoluble difficulties - - but theoretical\nabsurdities are not part of its  sacred repertoire.\n\n\nWould Omar have been a Hindu ?\n\n\nProbably, but the conclusions he would have drawn from the identity\nof God with nature would have scared the orthodox Hindu into fits.\n\n\nIf law is supreme, God is as impotent as you or I - - no better than\ninert matter.  \n\n\n  \" Lift nor your hands to it - - for help for It\n\n\nAs impotently moves as you or I\"  .  \n\n \n\nThat is so far as human conduct and yearnings go, we are left to\nourselves unaided, unguided.\n\n\nBut, of course, this is better than to be under a regime where you\nhave to worship a Power whom you can only hate. \n\n \n\nHas our life any worth, any purpose ?\n\n\nAre you and I necessary for the fulfilment of any of the  functions ? \n\n \n\nNo, he says, the Idea is of no importance.\n\n\nThe world goes on heedless of his coming and departure.\n\n\nObserve how similar the views of Athiests and Thiests are so far.\n\n\nThe sentiments above expressed may have been those of a devout monk\nor nun; It is when they draw their conclusions or assign causes to the events\ndescribed that they part company and go their opposite ways. \n\n \n\nOmar denies human responsibility for this wretched state of\naffairs.\n\n\nIt is either God or Destiny.\n\n\nHe hopes it is not the former, as in that case be will have to form\na low estimate of His power or benevolence.\n\n\nFew passages burn with more furious indignation than the one in\nwhich he assails the Personal God of Monotheistic theologies : \n\n\n  \" What out of senseless nothing provoke A conscious\nsomething to resent the yoke of unpermitted pleasure, under pain of\neverlasting penalties, if broke\"  .  \n\n \n\nIt is absurd for God who made man sinful to expect him to be\nvirtuous !\n\n\nThe same argument was employed by Leslie Stephen with crushing\neffect in his Agnostic Apology.  \n\n\n   \"  What from his helpless creature be repaid\n\n\nPure gold for what he lent him dross - - \n\n\nSue for a debt he never did contract,\n\n\nAnd cannot answer, oh the sorry trade !  \n\n \n\nHere follows an apostrophe to God staggering in its audacity and\nfull of the despairing fury of a heart tortured to the quick :  \n\n\n On Thou who didst with pitfall and with sin\n\n\nBeset the Road I was to wander in\n\n\nThou wilt not with predestined evil round\n\n\nEnmesh and then impute my fall to sin !  \n\n\nThe world is bound in the chain of cause and effect\"  . \n\n\n \n\n   \"  With  first clay they\ndid the last man knead.\n\n\nAnd there of the last harvest sowed the seed\"  .  \n\n \n\nWhat then is man to do ?\n\n\nSince the Universe is such a cursed irrational  affair, enjoy yourself while life lasts.\n\n\nPoet Gray said     \"   Eat drink, be\nmerry yourself and go the deuce - - if there be a deuce\"  .\n\n\nHe was not sure that  it was likely or desirable. \n\n\n Come fill the cup and in the fire of spring\n\n\nYour winter garment of repentance fling\n\n\nThe bird of time has but a little way\n\n\nTo flutter - - and the bird is on the wing.  \n\n \n\nDon't be too nice about it or apprehensive of future punishment\nor of the loss of happiness in the world to come : \n\n\n  \" An take the cash and let the credit go\n\n\nNor heed the rumble of a distant drum\"    the drum that calls up the dead to appear before the Judgement Seat of\nGod.\n\n\nIf you sought after the real solution of  weary\nriddle who knows that the answer will be pleasant :  \"  Better be\njoined with the fruitful grape than Sadden after none or bitter fruit\"\n .  \n\n \n\nHe has two lines of defence against the attacks of the believing\ngentry :\n\n\nIs not materialism also of God ?\n\n\nDid he make everything and leave only this one out ?

{"text": "VIOLENCE IS BETRAYAL OF DEMOCRACY  \n\n \n\nViolence has progressively increased in the years following \n  Independence.  \n\n\nThere is,    in fact   an alarming spurt\nin the incidence of communal riots.\n\n\nAgainst sixty one districts which had experienced communal trouble in\n1661 there are now eighty one districts identified as hypersensitive &\nanother ninety eight as sensitive districts from the communal point of view.\n\n\nIt seems to be spreading its tentacles a bit wider.\n\n\nAhmedabad &    Meerut   have become \n  notorious   cities for breeding    communal   trouble.\n\n\nIt was hoped that as secularism entrenches itself, the forces of\ncommunalism will become weak.\n\n\nBut far from subsiding the communal    centre\n  is gaining ground. \n\n \n\nCommunal tension of Hindu-Muslim variety has had a long & sordid\nhistory.\n\n\nIt has been further compounded by the developments in Punjab during\nthe last five years.\n\n\nThese developments have injected into the situation the potential for\na Hindu-    Sikh   confrontation which\nfortunately has not materialised.\n\n\nIf by & large the communities have restrained themselves &    retained   their sanity, it is inspite of the \n  communals   on either side.\n\n\nBut the restrained exercised by the two communities had come under\nserious strain following the mindless killings of the   \nSikhs   in the week immediately following the assassination of Mrs.\nIndira Gandhi & the three or four occasions when innocent bus passangers were\nshot dead by the    terrorists   . \n\n \n\nSeveral    commissions   which\nhave probed communal riots have found that it was possible to have kept down\nthe extent of loss of lives & damage to property, had the steps taken by the\nadministration been timely & purposive.\n\n\nIt may not be possible to prevent a riot every time but it is\ncertainly within the capacity of the administration to contain the fall out.\n\n\nBut there was the lack of political will, not enough attention has\nbeen paid to the question of conveying the message to those who have\ndeveloped a vested interest in promoting periodical riots that they cannot\nhope to buttress their communal leadership.\n\n\n   In fact   the base of their\nleadership has been broadening with every riot. \n\n \n\nNo less disquietening is the growth of caste violence which has\nreached frightening proportions in some regions.\n\n\nDr. B.R.Ambedkar moving the final reading of the constitution in the\nConstituent Assembly observed,  \" On the social plane we have in India\na society based on the principle of graded inequality which means elevation\nof some & degradation of others.\n\n\nOn the economic plane we have some who have immense wealth as against\nmany who live in abject poverty.\n\n\nOn Jan 26, 1950 we are going to enter into a life of contradictions.\n\n\nIn policies we will have equality & in a social & economic field we\nwill have inequality.\n\n\nWe must remove this contradiction <*> dotted line </*> else those who\nsuffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political democracy <*>\ndotted line </*> \" \n\n\nWe are still in the process of dismantling what we had inherited.\n\n\nWe are trying to usher in a society in which violence of injustice,\nviolence of human dignity & violence to human rights will all become a part\nof history that we have left    behind.  \n\n\nFor far too    large   we had a society\nwhich can  aptly be deseribed, in the words of\nTagore as one in which  \" the few are more than the many.\" \n\n\nVested interests do not allow us to achieve the ideals laid down in\nour constitution.\n\n\nWhatever changes towards the personal relationship which regains a\nmeasure of adaptability of the participants.\n\n\nThis has not been forth-coming.\n\n\nSo the result is conflicts & consequent violence which appear to the\nconcomitant of the ongoing social change. \n\n \n\nThe rural areas of Bihar & Uttar Pradesh have been disfigured by\ncruel & endemic violence because of land disputes.\n\n\nThe land reform measures as have been implemented have fallen short\nof legitimate expectations which were initially fostered among the landless\n   peasants   during the national movement.\n\n\nThe state of the land reforms as it existed on the eve of the sixth\nFive Year Plan 1980 was described this  \" Necessary determination has\nbeen    lacking   to effectively undertake\naction particulary in the matter of implementation of ceiling laws,\ncanalistiation of holdings & in not rigourously pursuing the concealed\ntendncy & having them vested with    tenancy  \nof occupancy rights as enjoined under the law\"  .\n\n\nThe Commission for Scheduled Caste & Scheduled Tribes in its\n\" Fifth Report \" had concluded that in many states the\nnecessary political will to implement land    reforms\n  was singularly lacking.\n\n\nThis gap between promise & performance has generated considerable\nvolume of avoidable violence.\n\n\nThe issue related to land often get an infusion of caste feeling &\nmindless violence erupts.\n\n\nThe ruthless massacre of the land owners or the tillers has been\ngoing on in U.P. & Bihar. \n\n \n\nReservation is another explosive issue that has tended to\naggravate caste animosities.\n\n\nViolence arising out of this issue has rocked Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh\n& Karnataka & now the people whole of the country.\n\n\nIt must be made clear that the reservation that is being resisted is\nnot what has been conceded to Scheduled Caste & Sheduled Tribes.\n\n\nIt is an expanding base of reservations among the so called back-ward\ncastes that threaten to produce a backlash.\n\n\nThe vested interests in backwardness that reservation has created\nmight also lead to a    re-alignment   of\ncommunities on lines that can only perpetuate the present division. \n\n \n\nThe conclusion that    follows   \nin    is that   the violence\n permeates the present Indian society,  that\nthe changes sought in the different fields are not accompanied by appropriate\n& matching institutionally mid-wifeing.\n\n\nSo chances are that the institutions will cease to become relevant\n ,  violence become inevitable only to the extent of the inadequacy &\nineffectiveness of the institutional infra-structure in general & the\ncriminal justice system in particular.  \n\n\n\n\n  FREEDOM OF PRESS  \n\n \n\nDemocracy as a form of government depends upon certain healthy\ntraditions.\n\n\nTill the people are conscious of their rights & duties it is not\npossible for democracy to work properly.\n\n\nSimilarly opposition should remain alert & put a check upon the\nerring government.\n\n\nApart from this the people in power should have moral integrity &\nshould be prepared to sacrifice their personal    interests   for the sake of the public.\n\n\nThe cooperation of the public & the mutual understanding between\nthe people & the government will ensure the proper working of democracy.\n\n\nBut human beings are selfish & particularly so in this competitive\nsociety.\n\n\nSo they cannot expect them to be large hearted to subordinate their\npersonal interests to the public interest.\n\n\nThat is why in the democratic set up checks & counterchecks are\nplaced.\n\n\nAn independent & powerful press can keep the people in power under\ncheck & keep the general public always informed. \n\n \n\nPeople in power have a tendency to become more powerful because\npower like a powerful intoxicant goes to the head.\n\n\nIn order to achieve this they always try to encroach upon the rights\nof the people.\n\n\nIf this process continues democracy is   \nprostituted   & it changes into dictatorship of the people in power.\n\n\nSo the government should be properly bridled.\n\n\nA common man cannot do anything about it because he had his own\nlimitations both psychological & financial.\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of the oppositon & the press to keep the\npeople in power under check.\n\n\nBy bringing out the secrets of the government & by pulling up the\nministers whenever they go against the public interest the press can play an\nimportant role in making democracy healthy. \n\n \n\nBut there is a great possibility that the press may not be able\nto play this role because newspaper is itself an industry which is run on\nprofit & loss basis.\n\n\nIt is generally thought that the press being under the influence of\nbig businessmen can never be impartial.\n\n\nIt always tries to further the interest of those businessmen & so\nthey view the activities of the government from the point of view of the\nbusiness interests.\n\n\nThat is why in many cases the criticisim given by the press is\npartial & one sided under such circumstances very unstable conditions are\ncreated in the country.\n\n\nSometimes it results in frustration among the people.\n\n\nSo the press can play a negative role & make the working of democracy\nsomewhat difficult. \n\n \n\nPress can keep the people well informed.\n\n\nA common man does not have access to the information regarding the\nworking of the governments & ministers.\n\n\nThe press tries to dig out that information & bring it before the\npublic.\n\n\nWatergate Scandal in America was unearthed by the press.\n\n\nThese types of malpractices should be brought to the notice of the\npublic in order to keep them well informed.\n\n\nIt brings the government to the dock & the public opinion goes\nagainst them.\n\n\nUnder such circumstances press can make the people in power conscious\nof their commitments of the public.\n\n\nIt this respect also we can say that the press is  \n misused   .\n\n\nSometimes the criticism by the press proves to be nothing more than\nslander.\n\n\nUnder such circumstances press can misguide the public & may prove\ndisastrous. \n\n \n\nDuring the elections press is supposed to play a very important\nrole.\n\n\nThe manifestoes of the different political parties can be brought\nhome to the people.\n\n\nSimilarly the speeches of the different leaders belonging to\ndifferent political parties must be properly reported.\n\n\nThat is why without press it may become very difficult for the voters\nto make a correct choice of the leaders.\n\n\nIf this function is not performed the very existence of many\npolitical parties will be meaningless. \n\n \n\nPress eastablishes a link between the people & the govt.\n\n\nThe grievances of the people should be brought to the notice of the\ngovernment & the  policies should be made known to the\npublic.\n\n\nTill there is a hot line between the people and the government it is\nnot possible for democracy to function properly.\n\n\nTill the people know about the activities of the government it is not\npossible for them to make a correct assessment of the work of their\nrepresentatives & if the grievances of the public are not publicised, the\ngovernment may try to ignore them.  \n\n\n\n\n  ROLE OF OPPOSITION IN DEMOCRACY.  \n\n \n\nPolitical opposition does not mean simple  \n criticism   of the people in power.\n\n\nThe opposition party is expected to give a healthy, construction &\nwell directed criticism.\n\n\nBy constructive critcism we mean criticism which is not meant to pull\ndown the people in <del> water </del power. \n\n\nHealthy criticisim stands for a criticisim based upon moral\nprinciples & basic values of life.\n\n\nOpposition party is primarily meant for helping the public in\nassessing the work of the people in power. \n\n \n\nDemocratic form of Government is supposed to work for the welfare\nof the people.\n\n\nBut generally it starts working against the people because it is\nguided more by the lust for power than    their  \nsincere desire to ameliorate the living conditions of the people.\n\n\nAs the Government becomes more powerful  ,  the rights of the\npeople are encroached upon  ,  consequently the institution of\ndemocracy degenerates.\n\n\nIt is the opposition that pinpoints lapses as well as the    weaknesses   of the people who constitute the\nGovernment.\n\n\nUnder such circumstances it is necessary for the oppsition party to\n point out to the public that the Government is not working in\nlarger    interests   of the country.\n\n\nThe image of the people in power is tarnished & they become unpopular\nwith the masses.\n\n\nThe fear of  losing support of the people makes\nthem to correct themselves. \n\n \n\nOpposition helps in making the people politically educated.\n\n\nThe party in power will always try to praise their own policies & a\ncomman man may live under illusions.\n\n\nOn the other hand opposition party will  bring political\nawakening among the people.\n\n\n   Moreover   when different policies\nare given by different political parties there is a choice for the people to\nmake.\n\n\nThis helps them to think & organise their thoughts properley.\n\n\nopposition party also takes up the momentary issues & awaken the\npeople to the realities of the situation.\n\n\nPolitical culture is important for a country as the political\ninstitution itself & opposition help in injecting the political culture. \n\n \n\nOpposition serves as an alternative to the Government.\n\n\nA common man does not want to depart from the beaten track.\n\n\nHe would like to have the same old things because they think that\nthe persons & ideas which have stood the test of time will live for all times\nto come.\n\n\nThat is why they generally become hero worshippers & start feeling\nthat the failure of government would mean great danger to the nation.\n\n\nIf there is a strong oppositon people will not depend upon the\nruling party only.\n\n\nThey will develop a healthy outlook & people would be able to\norganize themselves politically in a better manner. \n\n \n\nIn some of the contries opposition is given constitutional\nrecongnition.\n\n\nIn other countries opposition is completely wiped out.\n\n\nWhere there is no opposition authoritarianism becomes strong.\n\n\nWhereas the countries in which opposition is recongnized democracy\ncan    survive   .\n\n\nPolitical parties give proper direction to the efforts of the people\n& as such they can work for the welfare of the democratic society as a whole.\n\n\n \n\nIn a country like India, opposition is all the more necessary.\n\n\nThe people in power    becomes   alomst\nGods upon earth.\n\n\nAs such they are worshiped as super-human   \nbeings.  \n\n\nOpposition will awaken the people to realities.\n\n\nMoreover the people in power exploit the ignorance of others & so\nthey try to become more & more powerful.\n\n\nOpposition puts check    upon   them.\n\n\nOpposition is necessary for the consolidation of democracy &    maintenance   of democracy.\n\n\n   Sometimes   it play a negative\nrole & undermines the stability.\n\n\nThis should be checked as far as it  is  possible.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c0619a50-d602-48a3-bd8b-e5ab79f13569",

{"text": "SHORT STORY\n\n\nby Ruskin Bond\n\n\n  An island of trees  \n\n \n\n  KOKI   and her grandmother were\nsitting on a string cot in the shade of an old jack-fruit tree, and\nGrandmother was talking about her father and his great love for trees and\nflowers. \n\n \n\nGrandmother said : I was never able to get over the feeling\nthat plants and trees loved my father with as much tenderness as he loved\nthem.\n\n\nI was sitting beside him on the verandah steps one morning, when I\nnoticed the tendril of a creeping vine that was trailing near my feet.\n\n\nAs we sat there in the soft winter sunshine, I saw that the tendril\nwas moving very slowly away from me and towards my father.\n\n\nTwenty minutes later it had crossed the verandah step and was touching\nmy  feet. \n\n \n\nThere is probably a scientific explanation for the  behaviour - - something to do with light and warmth - - but I like to\nthink that it moved simply because it was fond of my father.\n\n\nOne felt like drawing close to him.\n\n\nSometimes when I sat alone beneath a tree I would feel a little\nlonely or lost.\n\n\nBut as soon as my father joined me, the garden would become a happy\nplace, the tree itself more friendly. \n\n \n\nYour great-grandfather had served many years in the Indian Forest\nService and so it was natural that he should know and understand and like\ntrees.\n\n\nOn his retirement he built this bungalow on the outskirts fo the\ntown, planting the trees that you see around it now: limes, mangoes, oranges\nand guavas; also jacaranda and laburnum and the Persian lilac.\n\n\nIn our valley, given the chance, plants and trees grow tall and\nstrong. \n\n \n\n  OF   course there were other\ntrees here before the house was built, including an old  peepul\n which had forced its way through the walls of an old, abandoned\ntemple, knocking the bricks down with its vigorous growth.\n\n\n Peepul  trees are great show-offs.\n\n\nEven when there is no breeze, their broad-chested, slim-waisted\nleaves will spin like tops, determined to attract your attention and invite\nyou into the shade. \n\n \n\nWhat happened to the temple, asked Koki. \n\n \n\nWell, my mother wanted the  peepul  tree cut down,\nbut my father said he would save both the tree and the temple.\n\n\nSo he rebuilt the temple around the tree, and there it is, on the\nother side of the wall.\n\n\nThe tree protects the temple, and the temple protects the tree.\n\n\nPeople from these parts feel  a friendly tree-spirit\ndwelling there, and they bring offerings of flowers and leave them at the\nbase of the tree. \n\n \n\nDid you know that I used to climb trees when I was a girl ?\n\n\nThis jack-fruit was my favourite tree,  quite easy to\nclimb.\n\n\nYou climb it too, don't you ? \n\n \n\nAnother good tree was the banyan behind the house.\n\n\nIts spreading branches, which hung to the ground and took root again,\nformed a number of twisting passageways.\n\n\nThe tree was older than the house, older than my grandparents.\n\n\nI could hide in its branches, behind a screen of thick green leaves,\nand spy on the world below. \n\n \n\nYes, the banyan tree was a world in itself, populated with small\nanimals and large insects.\n\n\nWhile the leaves were still pink and tender, they would be visited\nby the delicate map butterfly, who left her eggs to their care.\n\n\nThe  ` honey'  on the leaves - - a sweet, sticky smear\n- - also attracted the little striped squirrels, who soon grew used to\nhaving me in the tree and became quite bold, accepting food from my hand.\n\n\n \n\n  AT   night the tree was\nvisited by the hawk-cuckoo.\n\n\nIts shrill nagging cry kept us awake on hot summer nights.\n\n\nWe call the bird   ` pipiha'   , which\nmeans  ` rain is coming!'\n\n\nBut father said that according to Englishmen living in India, it\nseemed to be shouting up and up the scale :  ` Oh dear, oh dear !\n\n\nHow very hot  getting !\n\n\nWe feel it ... we feel it ... WE FEEL IT!\"  \n\n \n\nWell, the banyan has long since gone.\n\n\nIt came down in a storm, aerial roots and all.\n\n\nFather planted another, but as you can see,  still\nquite a young tree, the banyan takes a long time to grow. \n\n \n\nYour great-grandfather wasn't content with planting trees in our\ngarden or near the house.\n\n\nDuring the rains he would walk into the scrubland beyond the\nriver-bed, armed with cuttings and saplings, and he would plant them out\nthere, hoping to create a forest.\n\n\nBut grazing cattle and goats always finished them off. \n\n \n\n \" No-one ever goes there,\"  I said.\n\n\n \" Who will see your forest?\"  \n\n \n\n \" We are not planting it for people to see,\" \nsaid my father.\n\n\n \" We are planting for the earth itself - - and for the birds\nand animals who live on it and need more food and shelter. \n\n \n\n \" He told me how mankind, and not only wild creatures,\nneeded trees - - for keeping the desert away, for attracting rain, for\npreventing the banks of rivers from being washed away.\n\n\nBut everywhere people are cutting down the trees without planting\nothers.\n\n\nIf that continues, then one day there will be no forests at all and\nthe world will become one great desert!\"  \n\n \n\n  THE   thought of a world\nwithout trees became a sort of nightmare for me - -  one\nreason why I shall never want to live on the treeless Moon ! - - and I helped\nmy father in his treeplanting with even greater enthusiasm. \n\n \n\n \" One day the trees will move again,\"  he said.\n\n\n \" They have been standing still for thousands of years, but\none day they will move again.\n\n\nThere was a time when trees could walk about like people, but then\nalong came a terrible demon and cast a spell over them, rooting them to one\nplace.\n\n\nBut they are always trying to move - - see how they reach out with\ntheir arms!\"  \n\n \n\nOn one of our walks along the river banks, about a mile\nupstream from here, we found an island, a small rocky island in the middle\nof the riverbed.\n\n\nYou know what this riverbed is like - - dry in summer but flooded in\nthe monsoon.\n\n\nA young tamarind tree was growing in the middle of the island, and my\nfather said,     \"  If a tamarind can grow here,\nso can other trees.\"  \n\n \n\nAs soon as the monsoon rains arrived - - and while the river\ncould still be crossed - - we set out with a number of mango, laburnum,\nhibiscus and coraltree saplings and cuttings, and spent the better part of\na day planting them on the little island. \n\n \n\nWe made one more visit to the island before the monsoon\nfinally set in.\n\n\nMost of the plants looked quite healthy. \n\n \n\nThe monsoon season is the best time for rambling about, said the\nGrandmother.\n\n\nAt every turn there is something new to see.\n\n\nOut of earth and rock and leafless bough, the magic touch of the\nsummer rain has brought forth new life and verdure.\n\n\nYou can almost see the broad-leaved vines growing.\n\n\nPlants spring up in the most unlikely places.\n\n\nA  peepul  took root on the roof; a mango sprouted on\nthe window-sill.\n\n\nMy father and I did not want to remove them, but they had to go if\nthe house was to be prevented from falling down ! \n\n \n\n \"   IF   you two want to\nlive in a tree,  all right by me,\"  said my mother.\n\n\n \" But I like having a roof over my head, and  not\ngoing to have it brought down by a hanging forest.\n\n\nAlready I can see roots coming through the ceiling!\"  \n\n \n\nThe visiting trees were carefully removed and transplanted in\nthe garden.\n\n\nWhenever we came indoors from our gardening and sat down to a\nmeal, a ladybird or a caterpillar would invariably walk off our sleeves and\nwander about the kitchen, much to my  annoyance. \n\n \n\nThere were flowers in the garden, too; my mother loved scented\nflowers, like roses and sweet-peas and jasmine and Queen of the Night.\n\n\nBut my father and I found trees more exciting.\n\n\nThey kept growing and changing and attracting birds and other\nvisitors. \n\n \n\nThe banyan tree really came to life during the monsoon.\n\n\nThe branches were thick with scarlet figs.\n\n\nWe couldn't eat the berries, but the many birds that gathered in the\ntree - - gossipy rosy-pastors, quarrelsome  mynas  ,\ncheerful  bulbuls  and coppersmiths, and sometimes a noisy,\nbullying crow - - would feast on them.\n\n\nAnd when night fell and the birds were resting, the dark flying-foxes\nflapped heavily about the tree, chewing and munching loudly as they\nclambered  over the branches. \n\n \n\nThe tree crickets were a band of willing artists who started\nsinging at almost any time of the day.\n\n\nAt the height of the monsoon, the banyan tree was like an\norchestra with the musicians constantly tuning up.\n\n\nA small flute in my hands, I would add my shrill piping to that of\nthe crickets and cicadas.\n\n\nBut they must have thought poorly of my piping, because whenever I\nplayed, the insects fell silent ! \n\n \n\n  WHEN   I grew up, I was\nmarried and went to live with my husband in Bombay.\n\n\nYour father was my second child.\n\n\nWe were in Bombay for many years, and I could only visit my parents\nhere once or twice in all that time.\n\n\nI had no brothers, and when they died they left the house to me.\n\n\nIt will be yours one day.\n\n\nWould you rather live here or in that poky little house in the town ?\n\n\n \n\nHere, said Koki.\n\n\nBut only if you are here too, Granny. \n\n \n\nThe tree will be here, said Granny. \n\n \n\nAnd what about the island ? asked Koki.\n\n\nThe trees you planted with your father - - are they still there ?\n\n\n \n\nYou can see them for yourself if you feel like a walk.\n\n\nBut  tell you what I found when I came to live here\nagain after twenty years or more.\n\n\nI walked out of the old house and took the same path that my father\nand I used to take during our walks. \n\n \n\nIt was February, I remember, and as I looked across the dry\nriverbed, my eye was immediately caught by the spectacular red plumes of\nthe coral blossom.\n\n\nIn contrast with the dry riverbed, the island was a small green\nparadise.\n\n\nWhen I walked over to the trees, I noticed that a number of parrots\nhad come to live in them.\n\n\nA small spotted deer scampered away to hide in a thicket.\n\n\nAnd a wild pheasant challenged me with a mellow  `\nwho-are-you, who-are-you ...'  \n\n \n\nBut the trees seemed to know me.\n\n\nI am sure they whispered among themselves and beckoned me nearer.\n\n\nI ran my hands over their bark and it was like touching the hands of\nold friends.\n\n\nAnd looking around, I noticed that other small trees and wild plants\nand grasses had sprung up under the protection of those who we had planted\nthere. \n\n \n\nThe trees had multiplied!\n\n\nThe forest was on the move!\n\n\nIn one small corner of the world, my  dream was\ncoming true, and the trees were walking again !

{"text": "BOMBAY STOCK EXCHANGE \n\n\n Restrictive role \n\n \n\nAfter several months of speculations, a definite proposal was\nsubmitted last month by the governing board of the Bombay Stock Exchange (\nBSE) on the subject of admitting financial institutions, their subsidiaries\nas well as the subsidiaries of State Bank of India and the nationalised banks\non the stock exchange.\n\n\nThe proposal contained in the form of a report, has set out certain\nconditions on the operations of the institutional members. \n\n \n\nThe report which is fairly comprehensive, places restrictions\non organisations that can qualify as members of the BSE.\n\n\nIt seeks to grant membership only to subsidiaries of public\nfinancial institutions and states that they will be engaged only in\nactivities that other member brokers are permitted.\n\n\nThe reason   is   to avoid a conflict of interest\nbetween the lending business of the financial institutions and the stock\nbroking business. \n\n \n\nEvery institution and bank can only have one subsidiary throughout\nthe country that can become a member of the stock exchange, states the\nreport.\n\n\nThe BSE proposes to allow stockbroking subsidiaries, lend multiple\nmembership of stock exchanges.\n\n\nThe report has made it conditional for the holding company to\nprovide an unconditional guarantee for an unlimited amount that relates to\nthe dues of the stockbroking subsidiary.\n\n\nStockbroking subsidiaries, the report states,   \" should\nnot provide loans or other credit facilities to their customers or make any\npayment to clients at a discount.\n\n\nIn other words, banking business should not be undertaken by the\nstockbroking subsidiary.\"   \n\n \n\n Restrictive role. \n\n\nComments Harish Bhasin, president, Delhi Stock Exchange which was the\nfirst to admit financial institutions as members of the DSE a year ago,\n  \" I would term the restrictions as being broadly fair.\n\n\nBut the basic difference is we ( DSE) admitted institutions and bank\nsubsidiaries as ordinary members - - without any special conditions.\"\n \n\n\nAccording to him, the institutions being under the watchful eye of\nthe Reserve Bank of India ( RBI) are not free to operate.\n\n\n  \" As we have seen, the institutions play a restrictive\nrole now that the Bombay Stock Exchange has a new set of conditions.\"\n   <call-out>\n\n\nAn institution can have only one subsidiary as a stock exchange\nmember.\n\n\nBut the BSE proposes to allow stockbroking subsidiaries lend multiple\nmembership of exchanges </call-out>\n\n \n\nIt is not hard to see why the committee constituted by the BSE\ngoverning board has taken a restrictive view on institutional membership.\n\n\nAs the report observes, such an entry by the stockbroking\nsubsidiary would result in a large number of workers losing the existing and\nfuture benefits.\n\n\n  \" Hence, initially restrictions on the quantum of\nbusiness to be done by stockbroking subsidiaries are required, to protect the\nbusiness of numerous brokers all over the country.\"   \n\n \n\nThe  view is that the entry of institutional\nmembers will only expand, the stockbroking business.\n\n\nIt will indicate how serious the government is about opening up what\nhas essentially remained a closed club for several decades. \n\n\n<*> black-square</*>  <@AS> A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT {#}  \n\n\n\n\n Stabilising falling markets \n\n \n\n ( For the period 29 January to 10 February 1990)\n \n\n \n\n BSE National Index on 10 February = 369.95, down from 399.68\n( - 7.4 per cent). \n\n \n\nBSE Sensitive Index on 10 February = 659.3, down from 716.23 ( -\n7.9 per cent). \n\n \n\nBSE Daily Turnover Average for the fortnight ended 10 February\n= Rs. 63.7  crore  , down 27 per cent. \n\n \n\nBSE Daily Trading Volume for the fortnight ended 10 February =\n66  lakh  shares, down 28 per cent.   \n\n\n \n\nStockmarkets continued to fall sharply for the second successive\nfortnight on declining volumes.\n\n\nThe deteriorating political situation in Kashmir was widely\nattributed to be the reason, although its stabilisation did not help\nmarkets recover in the second half of the fortnight.\n\n\nNew worries surfaced, particularly regarding the ongoing role of\nUTI in the capital markets about which there is, at present, considerable\nconfusion. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, the market - - thanks to sharp price falls on low\nvolumes - - is yet to become heavily oversold.\n\n\nThe rise in markets through December took place on the turnover\naveraging around Rs. 100  crore  per day.\n\n\nThe fall in markets since January has, however, occurred on the\nturnover averaging at around 30 per cent less.\n\n\nThis means that speculators who started purchasing in December\nstill hold about 30 per cent of their forward buying ( long) positions.\n\n\nThey are, therefore, unlikely to turn bullish ( in the normal course\nof events) until the budget is over. \n\n \n\n Volatile market. \n\n\nThis is a relatively new situation for the market and has arisen from\nthe reduced role of financial institutions.\n\n\nIn the past, institutions mopped up shares after price peaks and\ncontinued their buying when prices fell ( as part of their role in  \"\nstabilising\"  markets).\n\n\nThis allowed bulls-turned-bears to quickly dump their forward\npositions on to institutions at a profit and join the bear brigade.\n\n\nHowever, the recent inactivity of the Unit Trust has meant that the\nold rule of  \" sharp rises but gentle falls\"  is no longer\nvalid.\n\n\nThe market is now likely to be volatile in both directions. \n\n \n\nThe buying speculation in December had centered on shares with\nstrong fundamentals.\n\n\nWith the general decline in the market since January, bull\nspeculators tended to book profits first and take losses later.\n\n\nHence, the sharpest falls occurred in shares which had risen strongly\nin December.\n\n\nThese included pharmaceutical shares which have, therefore, been the\nfocus of considerable speculative disinvestment over the fortnight in\nspite of good expected performance. <call-out>\n\n\nInstitutions must try to maximise the  returns and\nit should be irrelevant whether they sell shares or not </call-out>\n\n\nHoechst fell over the fortnight from Rs. 1,840 to Rs. 1,530 ( down 17\nper cent), while Glaxo fell from Rs. 108 to Rs. 93.50) ( down 13 per cent)\nand Hindustan Ciba fell from Rs. 1,250 to Rs. 1,110 ( down 11 per cent). \n\n \n\nThe trading restrictions imposed on market leaders ( including a\nban on short sales of Tisco in both Calcutta and Bombay and Telco, among\nother shares) also adversely affected share prices in the  'B'\n group.\n\n\nSince most of the  'B'  group scrips have lower equity\nbases, there may have been increased price volatility on account of\nspeculative selling.\n\n  Decline in value. \n\n\nWhat has affected the market the most has been the fall in the prices\nof shares belonging to the Reliance and Abhey Oswal group ( see table).\n\n\nThe market value of the shares of just these two groups has fallen by\nover Rs. 2,000  crore  ( or about 4 per cent of market\ncapitalisation) since October.\n\n\nThis fall makes up over one-third of the total decline in market\nvalues of Rs. 6,000  crore  since October.\n\n\nOf course, any investor, who took possession of such shares just\nbefore the elections was taking a political gamble ( which did not pay off)\nand should have been fully aware of the risks.\n\n\nBut there are probably several hundreds of thousands who invested in\nthese companies from their inception and who have been watching the price\nmovements and the consequent decline in the values of their portfolios\nwith dismay. \n\n \n\nThey, along with many other investors, are probably hoping for a\n return to the capital markets as a major buyer.\n\n\nThis would be a mistake if it is so.\n\n\nLike the ones before him, the finance minister favours a  \"\nstabilising\"  role for financial institutions.\n\n\nIn the past, however, institutions have been able to absorb falls\nthough not entirely stop them.\n\n\nThe price they have paid for gentler falls is that they are now\noverloaded with shares of scrips like Reliance whose price they tried to\nstabilise ( which made sense at the time given the prominence of Reliance\nshares on the BSE Sensitive Index). \n\n \n\nThe ideal role for institutions is to try and maximise the\nreturns of investors in their various schemes.\n\n\nSince the UTI is always a net acquirer of funds from the\npublic, it should be irrelevant whether it sometimes sells shares or not.\n\n\nAnd there are enough shares of good investment quality available at\nany point of time for purchase.\n\n\nIn other words, financial institutions should not be asked to\nconsider market stabilisation as a policy goal.\n\n\nBy following the simple rule of value maximisation, the\ninstitutions will automatically help stabilise markets. \n\n\n<*> black-square</*>  <@AS> RAFIQ DOSSANI {#}  \n\n\n\n\n AMUSEMENT PARKS \n\n\n First off, after some hiccups   \n\n \n\nAfter months of controversy, Esselworld, the \nfirst amusement park at Gorai in north Bombay, was formally inaugurated on\nChristmas eve 1989 by the Maharashtra chief minister, Sharad Pawar, whose\nadministration had been accused, by his political opponents of irregularly\ngranting the various permissions for the project.\n\n\nSharing the dais with Pawar was Ram Naik, the BJP MP from north\nBombay who had earlier vehemently opposed the project on the ground that it\nwould add to vehicular congestion and strain the public utilities in the\narea. \n\n \n\nThe park had earlier been informally opened to the employees and\nshareholders of Essel Packaging, of which  Amusement\nParks ( India) Ltd is a subsidiary, and to annual passport holders of\nEsselworld on 14 November, the birth centenary of Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\n\nEighty per cent of the first phase has now been completed with 30-odd\nrides having been installed at a cost of around Rs. 20.5  crore\n .\n\n\nThe park has a regular flow of nearly 3.500 people on week days,\nwhich swells to around 10,000 on Sundays and holidays, according to an\nEsselworld spokesman. \n\n \n\n Land development. \n\n\nThe park is situated on a 64 acre plot of land which is part of a 689\nacre plot acquired by the company at a court auction in 1982.\n\n\nHowever, pending settlement of a dispute with the state government\nover ownership of the land, the company was allowed to develop only 64 acres\n(  Business India  , April 17-30, 1989).\n\n\nIt has since got an   ad interim   order\nfrom the Bombay High Court in May last year, permitting it to develop the\nrest of the land. \n\n \n\nThe company has effectively laid to rest the anxiety of local\npoliticians, environmentalists and administrative officials of the state\ngovernment and the Bombay Municipal Corporation ( BMC), regarding\ncongestion and the adverse effects, the park would have on the environment.\n\n\nThe park will use water from the ten bore wells on the premises,\nwhich has so far been adequate to meet the requirements of the park.\n#@*@ To ease traffic congestion the company has undertaken to build parking\nlots at Borivili and Gorai jetties, two approach points, at a cost of around\nRs. 10  lakh  .\n\n\nThese will be handed over to the Bombay Municipal Corporation ( BMC)\nto be run as pay-and-park lots after they are built.\n\n\nMoreover, the park has its own parking lot for around 2,000 cars\noutside the entrance.\n\n\nVisitors coming to the park by road will have to use the\ncomparatively uncongested route via Bhayander, a suburb, north of the\ncity. \n\n \n\nThe company plies mini buses from the suburbs of Borivili and\nMalad to carry visitors to the park free of cost.\n\n\nSoon a sister concern, Empire Holdings, will operate a ferry service\nacross an adjacent creek, thus easing the burden on the existing ferry\nservice.\n\n\nThe ferry boats, being built in Goa, are flat-bottomed ones that will\nbe able to ply even during low tide so that passengers will not be stranded\nwhen the tide is too low for the existing boats to operate. \n\n \n\nThe additional commissioner of police ( traffic), P.S. Pasricha,\nhad earlier granted the park permission to remain open only till 5 pm for\nfear of congestion.\n\n\nHowever, after seeing the traffic arrangements made, he has now\nallowed it to operate till 8 pm.\n\n\nSays a company spokesman,   \" Now we have received all the\npermissions, the last one to come in being the BMC commencement certificate.\n\n\nWe can now go ahead unhindered, though after a delay of seven\nmonths due to the controversy.\"   \n\n\n<*> black-square</*>  <@AS> ALOYSIUS FERNANDEZ {#}", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fac5521c-f4c3-4389-9f25-e7fbe6b9a90d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.155948+00:00"}
{"text": "Impact   Of Science On\nHuman Life.  \n\n \n\nFirstly before the    impact   we\nunderstand the meaning of science and emergence in our human life. \n\n \n\nScience means \" the systematic study of a \"\nknowledge or a subject.\n\n\nThe basic concept in scientific thinking are as follows: \n Science and Reason - -\n\n \n\nThe middle age has witnessed the tremendous progress of science\nand it has been truely called as the age of Science.\n\n\nFrom the 15th century the progress of science has been phenomenal.\n\n\nThe growing wealth of western nations provided ample    opportunity   and scope for scientific progress.\n\n\nThe patronage in science resulted not only in the discovery of\nscientific truth, but also in the building up of a new and refreshing\noutlook. \n\n \n\nThe progress of science gave rise to a scientific outlook to\nlife.\n\n\nBlind faith has been completely replaced by rational conviction in\nthe middle age.\n\n\nNo one is ready or willing to accept a thought or theory, which is\nnot based on substantial reasons or which in its support does not cite enough\nproof or evidence.\n\n\nThis has in turn not only influenced life considerably but has also\nincreased the output of scientific discovery and the pace of its progress.\n\n\n \n\nThe progress of science has also acted to discipline man.\n\n\nMany old principles of science have been replaced by new ones as a\nresult of further investigation, observation and experiment.\n\n\nThis has been compelled man not to be too dogmatic in his assertions.\n\n\nHe has to recognise the probablity of newer data other proofs more\n   convincing   , another point of view,\nmore forceful which could effectively  (  after the conclusions he has\narrived at, or may even disprove  it   )  \nupholds.\n\n\nThe scientist and the common man should, therefore not only be too\ndogmatic and over - -    jubilant   about\ntheir achievements, but they should keep an open mind so as to revive the\ntruth from whenever, it may emerge.\n\n\nThis receptivity of the mind is a great boon, as is keeps man alert\nand active. \n\n\n Scientific Observation and Experimentation. \n\n \n\nThe classical methods of arriving at scientific truth were\nrediscovered    in   Europe,  \n beginning   the Age of Renaissance Original thinking was one of\nthe most important cause of ( Renaissance) science.\n\n\nThe church had set its own pattern of thinking in the medieval period\nbased on blind faith and dogmas.\n\n\nThe Church penalised those thinkers, who went against the principles\nand attitude approved by the Church.\n\n\nIt was difficult to challenge the Church and her custodians and\nindependent thinkers were likely to ruin their career or even    lose   their lives.\n\n\nBut gradually thinkers came out boldly with their ideas, and it was\nthen that free thinking became possible.\n\n\nAmong them Roger Bacon laid the foundation of modern science by his\ninsistence on the experimental method in science.\n\n\nHe believed that scientific truth can be ascertained and rightly\naffirmed only by observing its nature or knowing it by actual\nexperimentation.\n\n\nIt was not correct to take anything for granted simply because it had\nbeen proclaimed by another scholar.\n\n\nAlso the scientists like William Harvey his theory of the circulation\nof    blood    new approach to\nthe study of the universe and Sir Issac  discovery of the\nLaws of Gravitation detailed out in his   ` Principia\nMathematica'   were pioneering achievements in the age of\nScience, which excited the imagination of marry a young man and the\npatronage afforded to research as a result of the wealth built up on\naccount of the expansion of European commercial activity and later due to the\nmechanisation of industry made possible tremendous progress of science.\n   Spirit of Enquiry ( Why and How of\nthings) \n\n \n\nIn a broad sense, Renaissance means much more than rebirth or\nrevival of interest in    learning   and art.\n\n\nIt stands for an    all round  \ndevelopment and is widening of the human mind & horizon.\n\n\nDuring the middle ages the human mind had been under the control of\nthe Church, but with release of the human mind  \n original thinking   and experimentations were possible.\n\n\nThere was a time in Europe    where it was \n possible, all the things    held   out by\nChurch had to be accepted as the    gospel    truth.\n\n\nBut the Renaissance created the spirit of enquiry.\n\n\nIt was now possible to ask questions, How ? and why ?\n\n\nAnd so it was caused to a scientific investigations observations.\netc. \n\n \n\nAnd thus Renaissance stood for a new enterprising and active\nspirit, which penetrated all fields of human thought and activity.\n\n\nRenaissance, thinkers, scholars, explorers  and\nartists    infused   a new spirit, which\nbrought about a great transition from the medieval world of blind faith,\ndogmas, and confirmity to the modern world of free thought and expression\nrationalism and scientific experimentation. \n\n \n\nAnd now we discuss below the    impact \n of science  on human life  which    is \n great or boon as well as bad or damage for human life. \n\n \n\nScience has made a development in all parts of a human life, e.g.\nin Medicine, Space Research, Industry, Agriculture, Fishery, Construction,\nMusic, Art, etc. and etc.\n\n\nBecause of Alexander  new discovered substance\nwhich is called  ` Antibiotic'  Penicillin, we can destroy a\nbacterial  by using it.\n\n\nIt also affected on human life by the invention of Entertainment\ndevice called as Television  which  was invented by John Logie Baird,\na Scotsman, in 1922.\n\n\nBecause of T.V.    we   can watch all the\nevents, past events, sports, Orchestra which is happening anywhere in the\nworld, in our    living room.  \n\n\nIt greatly affected on social life of human   \nbeings.  \n\n\nIt is useful for educative, scientific, entertainment \npurpose and for the knowledge gaining things specially for rural,    ignorant   people of India.\n\n\nBecause of space research human  beings  can \ntouch and stand on the moon, and also trying to get more and more about other\nplanets, galaxies etc. \n\n \n\nScience has made great revolutionary things in Agricultural &\nIndustrial sectors.\n\n\nA new seed named  ` Hybrid'  has proved to be very\nsuccessful in the case of maize which mainly is a cattle feed in USA,  also some new discovered    Indian   wheat\nseeds like  Bansi, Kalyan Sona, Vijay  etc. are very famous\nfor their superiority.\n\n\nComputers made a great revolution in all the sectors of human life.\n\n\nComputer is used for educational, scientific, business, musical,\nartistic and in constructional sectors. \n\n \n\nWith the great effects science has also many bad effects but they\nare also  able to  change into good effects if we use them for a \n  peaceful   life, happy life in the world etc.\n\n\nIn the second world war America used a Hydrogen bomb and    threw   it on the big cities of Japan namely\nHiroshima and Nagasaki, due to this Japan has   \ngreatly   damaged and still  pains in their\n   minds.  \n\n\nThe recent example is of France which has tested their nuclear bombs\nin Pacific Ocean, due to this the cold war emerged between big and developed\ncountries, which affected the world life.\n\n\nAmerica has made its development by substantial use of science.\n\n\nSo she is a powerful and highly developed country in the world, and\ndoing what she will like, for e.g. a recent news that President     govt is   ready to supply nuclear &\ndefensive weapons    supplied   to    Pakistan.  \n\n\nIt is dangerous to South Asian countries. \n\n \n\nSo if we use the advantages of sciences properly and made all the\nthings of the world for    happiness   & peaceful\n purposes  then our earth will remain in future.\n\n\nOur next generation can live a happy and prosperous life without any\nfear in their mind.\n\n\nBecause God has made this earth, life for living & maintain our earth\n& planets    then   it will  \n true   that human being is really a developed &    happiest   man, in the Universe.  \n\n <*> enclosed in a dotted box </*>\n\n\n ARE WE PROGRESSING <*> dotted line </*> ? \n\n \n\nThe title itself asks  us the question whether we\nare happy & contented with our progress or is there some sort of repentness\nhidden in our happiness. \n\n \n\nWell, as we know    the   primitive\nman worked with his hands, so we called it to be  ` Age of\nHands', then he progressed he tamed animals so he ushered in the\n ` Age of Animals'  .\n\n\nThe progress followed him, it touched  feet so there\ncame the  ` Age of Steam'  ,  ` Age of Electricity'\n ,  ` Age of Bombs'  & so on ...\n\n\nThus  man being considered as the most intelligent creature\nliving on the surface  of the earth  started progressing.\n\n\nMan & progress walked hand in hand.\n\n\nHe was very happy and <del> prod <del> proud to be called  `\nMan - -    the   most creative & intelligent one'\n .\n\n\nNow he started thinking & progressing to meet new    adventure   & comfort giving things. \n\n \n\nAs we know  , primitive man   \nwas   tranquil & free from tensions, their lives & possessions seemed\nsecured & had a sense of security &     cerainty.  \n\n\nThey dwelt in peace.\n\n\nThey breathed fresh air which was pure.\n\n\nThey ate plain but healthy food, they drank pure milk.\n\n\nThey had plenty of  exercise in great open spaces.\n\n\nTheir lives were quite natural.\n\n\nThey were so carefree children of good earth.\n\n\nThey had ample of leisure to observe & enjoy & feel the wonder of\nnature.\n\n\nThey had eyes for sunrise & sunset; they had warm hearts & contented\nminds,  ` true happiness lies in sweet content'  .\n\n\nThough the resources were scant, but so were their needs\n& wants.\n\n\nIn short, the past age was truly happy.\n\n\nBut the greed    for   progress part man\nfrom nature mother. \n\n \n\nFirst progress came to man, man walked hand in hand with progress\nbut now, progress has dragged man far away from nature & beauty.\n\n\nHe made excellent discoveries & inventions; his curiosity  has no limits for comfort.\n\n\nThis greed    for   progress tore him apart\nfrom beauty, nature & above all peace & self-contentment.\n\n\nNow in present era, we find machines ruling over  man. \n\n\nMan made machine, & most of the work is done by them; machines do\nsave lot of time,  the use,  in exchange it is\nreadily consuming man to man relationship, causing no  humanitarian feeling for one another.\n\n\nMan is betraying each other.\n\n\nWe have    turned   blind towards\nexercising what is good & beautiful.\n\n\n why living under a wrong impression made us  shoot our own Gandhis &    Kennedys.\n  \n\n \n\nProgress meant a blessing but man misused &   \nturned   it to be a curse on human race.\n\n\nOur souls have not kept pace with our progress we still are  busy creating nuclear weapons to destroy the very own man-hood.\n\n\nWe are living in shadows of great danger,  and\nstill what we defined it as the mere name  \" Progress\"  \n\n \n\nThis progress has followed materialistic lines at the cost of our\nspiritual value.\n\n\nOur selfishness & greed & lust for power considering as progress\nhave assisted monstrous weapons & modern warfare. \n\n \n\nProgress has enslaved man.\n\n\nProgress meant for betterment of   \nlivelihood   .\n\n\nScientific progress  is misused creating nuclear\nbombs & not for betterment but to  extinguish the lovely &\nbeautiful  creativity.\n\n\nThere are large enough stock-pile of atomic bombs today which are\nthirsting to destroy whole world.\n\n\nThis nuclear war can wipe off the existence of life from the globe.\n\n\nSuch is the present prospect  today.\n\n\n heart has moved with his head; Hunger for progress has\nmade him possess a stone-hard heart with no basic human emotions.\n\n\nProgress has left our soul far behind. \n\n \n\nThe  ` ape'  in man has got the better of his\n ` essence'  & so man is misusing the blessings & turning into\ncurse.\n\n\nThe wonders in progress are employed to satisfy the beast in man.\n\n\nProgress in any field be  it  science, machinery, knowledge\ncontributes the feeling of victory & artifical happiness but this    artificialness    is of\ntemporary satisfaction. \n\n \n\nAs we are progressing, we are wiping the foot-prints of truth,\nhappiness, contentment inherited by primitive man & are sketching the line of\ndestruction. \n\n\nWe are progressing & progressing but are parting    ourselves   from humanity, nature, goodness, beauty &\nblessings which have just remained  \" words\"  as such .. \n\n \n\nNow, don't we have the feelings of lackness related to progress.\n\n\nDon't we think of being satisfied with basic needs.\n\n\nCan't we survive with nature.\n\n\nNature is ready to hug us and care for us and pour its love upon us\n<*> dotted line </*> but we the mankind  run behind  things which are for destruction which part from natural care.\n\n\nTho' we think we have progressed but we have failed to admire nature\n<*> dotted line </*> isn't it <*> dotted line </*>\n\n\nAnd now       too late to\nturn back, for we neglected nature, but nature    calls\n  us

{"text": "THE GAME OF GOD  \n\n\n SUSHIL DAWKA  \n\n \n\n `   JUNGLE   '  is\na rather unimaginative name for a world, but those who have been there\ninsist that no other name would do, for the planet was just that - - one vast\ncontinuous tropicaloid forest, and nothing else. \n\n \n\nFar off the space lanes, in a forgotten sector of the Galaxy,\nJungle was just another Earth-like world, too remote to be worth colonizing.\n\n\nIt would have remained so, one of a myriad anonymous green dots\nspattered on the official wall map of the Galaxy, had not some imbecilic\nplanner from Mining and Supply reached up as high as he could and said,\n \" We need a fuel depot far out, say, here.\" \n\n\nHere, of course, being Jungle. \n\n \n\nJungle was hardly the place to spend  vacation, but\nwhen Krishneider invited me over, I jumped at the opportunity.\n\n\nHe was pump engineer on Jungle, home on leave, and due to return the\nnext day.\n\n\nHe had dropped in to say goodbye.\n\n\nA snowstorm was raging outside when he told us about Jungle, and, in\nthe crackling mellow glow of the ion fireplace, it seemed to me a world of\nfantasy and adventure waiting to be  explored.\n\n\nThe discomforts and inconveniences he described only added to its\nallure, and when he jokingly suggested I go and see for myself, I was\nthrilled and immediately agreed. \n\n \n\nWe hitched a ride on the supply tanker.\n\n\nIt took two days to get there.\n\n\nI have travelled in space before, but not on anything as\nuncomfortably utilitarian as a cargo vessel, and was relieved when we\ntransferred to the landing pod.\n\n\nThis shuttle-craft had view windows and, as we drew away from the\ntanker, I could see its drab grey hull with the hosepipe trailing down into\nthe cloud cover of the planet.\n\n\nSoon we descended into the clouds and all was grey until suddenly the\n surface was revealed. \n\n \n\nAs far as the eye could see, the planet was covered entirely with\none continuous, unrelieved carpet of green vegetation.\n\n\nThere seemed to be no bare spots except, of course, for the\nrectangular clearing towards which we were headed.\n\n\nAt one end of the landing field were prefab huts, while at the other\nwere the fuel bowsers and the storage tanks from which the \nhosepipe snaked upwards into the clouds. \n\n \n\nI have been on other terroid and terraformed worlds before, but\nnothing had prepared me for the scalding blast of hot, steamy air that\nengulfed me as I walked out into the  atmosphere.\n\n\nI gasped, feeling suffocated and nauseated as Krishneider hurried me\nacross the field into the huts.\n\n\nAs I greedily gulped lungfulls of the cool dry air inside, he\nlaughed. \n\n \n\n \"  get used to it in a few minutes, don't\nworry,\"  he said.\n\n\n \" But first, a wash and a meal.\"  \n\n \n\nThe other three men stationed on Jungle had been out filling the\nfuel tanks, and as we sat down to eat, they trooped in.\n\n\nThey were, I noticed, beaded with sweat and their clothes were\npatchily wet.\n\n\nAfter brief introductions all around, they excused themselves for a\nbath and a change. \n\n \n\nWhen the men joined us a short while later, I had a good look at\nthem.\n\n\nThey were all toughened veterans, men of the world, variations on a\ntheme.\n\n\nThey made polite conversation but I could see that they, each one of\nthem, were basically loners; taciturn and self-contained, congregating only\nfor meals and for work. \n\n \n\n \"  going to be bored here,\"  the\nman called Ramamoto said.\n\n\n \" This fuel dump is just that, a dump.\"  \n\n \n\nThe others smiled at what must have been a stock joke. \n\n \n\n \"  nothing to see outside except the\ndepressingly same forest,\"  the man called Davidyadhar said.\n\n\n \"  tire of it in an hour.\n\n\n got a well-stocked library, of course, but you didn't\ncome here to watch vids.\n\n\nSorry, but ours is a terribly uninteresting world.\"  \n\n \n\n \" Don't believe them,\"  the man called Inderson\nsaid.\n\n\n \" Go out and have a look for yourself.\n\n\nThe air is no worse than, or as good as, that of the saunas on your\nhome planet.\" \n\n\nHe smiled and added,  \" If you like  take you\nexploring some day\"  . \n\n \n\n \" Just don't get lost,\"  Krishneider warned.\n\n\n \" Go out whenever you like, but don't wander too far.\n\n\n no need to, really.\n\n\nIts all the same everywhere.\"   \n\n \n\nAfter lunch I went out.\n\n\nThe blast was less intense, perhaps because I was expecting it.\n\n\nIt did feel just as though I were entering a sauna and as I began to\nsweat at the door of the hut I began to feel better.\n\n\nThe planet, I decided, could be tolerated. \n\n \n\nThe sky was clouded over, grey and damp like a wiping rag.\n\n\nThere was no wind and it was searingly hot.\n\n\nThe air shimmered and steamed and I rained sweat. \n\n \n\nI walked to the edge of the landing field.\n\n\nThe forest seemed to be straining inwards, held back as it was by a\nfence of barbed wire and a zone of soil impregnated with plant-toxin.\n\n\nThere was a stepladder over the fence and I clambered across into the\nforest.\n\n\nTwenty paces inwards and the landing field was out of sight.\n\n\nI looked around.\n\n\nThe plants were typical of tropicaloid forests anywhere - -\nbroadleaves, treeferns, creepers, shrubby undergrowth and the all-pervading\nsmell of wet rot.\n\n\nThe ground was moist and the vegetation was shiny wet.\n\n\nIt never rained here on Jungle, but everything dripped water with an\nincessant, nerve-wracking drip-drip-drip.\n\n\nThere was no natural break in the forest cover, I had been told.\n\n\nNo clearings or glades, no pools of water, no rivers, no hills, no\nvalleys - - the tropicaloid forest blanketed the planet like a green fungus.\n\n\nDays were never really bright, nights never dark.\n\n\nThere was no hint of the  direction, no break in the\ngrey cloud-stratum, no shadows by day and no stars at night. \n\n \n\nUnfortunately, the fuel depot too turned out to be as boringly\nunchanging as the surrounding forest.\n\n\nI had expected to see interstellar craft buzzing in and out and had\neven brought along my  handbook.\n\n\nThe sole hour of maintenance chores each day seemed to be all the\nactivity here.\n\n\nI asked Ramamoto about this lack of traffic. \n\n \n\n \" No commercial transport comes this way,\"  he\nsaid.\n\n\n \"  in a sparsely populated sector near the  edge, you know.\n\n\nNo private craft can get here : we are more than a tankful away from\nthe nearest fuel depot, in any direction.\n\n\nAll we get is the occasional smuggler sneaking into the Galaxy\nthrough the back door.\n\n\n bureaucratic planning for you - - an expensively\nmaintained fuel dump of use to illegals only.\"  \n\n \n\nThe men passed their time watching vids or reading.\n\n\nI spent the first week getting thoroughly bored.\n\n\nI went out along with the men on their daily chores but ventured\nalone into the forest just twice.\n\n\nOnly Inderson seemed to have something to do.\n\n\nHe read a lot, he made notes, he painted, and he went for long\nsolitary walks at all odd hours. \n\n \n\nI also saw him often take a ray-gun from the rack and walk off\ninto the forest, whistling softly.\n\n\nHours later,  show up at the door of the hut, dripping\nwet, with mud-spattered boots and a strange light in his usually distant\neyes.\n\n\nOnce, in response to my curious look, he grinned and said,  \"\nOh I just wander here and there.\"  \n\n \n\nImagine my surprise then when, one day, he said to me suddenly,\n \" Grab a gun and come with me.\n\n\n get to the heart of Jungle.\"  \n\n \n\nOur walks became a regular feature.\n\n\nInderson would walk ahead throughout the forest, apparently at\nrandom, though he never lost his way.\n\n\nI dawdled behind, amazed that he could recognize anything in that\ngreen leafy uniformity.\n\n\nNow and then, he would stop and point out some interesting feature.\n\n\nOnce, I brought along my notebook to jot things down but the constant\ndripping from above smudged everything.\n\n\nI was therefore pressed to remember and gradually the intricate\necology of the planet became apparent.\n\n\nInderson showed me ingenious seed dispersal mechanisms, plants that\nfought for living room by dripping soluble toxins from their leaves and\nelaborate insect traps. \n\n \n\n \" But  no  fauna  on\nJungle,\"  I said. \n\n \n\n \" Oh there certainly is,\"  he said.\n\n\n \" No large animals, of course, or our scanners would have\ndetected them, but there are quite a few insectoids, a few bugoids and\ngruboids, a  \nlizardoid, some frogoids <*> dotted line</*> nothing very remarkable.\"\n \n\n \n\n \" How come I haven't seen any?\"  \n\n \n\n \"  because of the squelchy sounds you make\nas you approach,\"  he said.\n\n\n \" Believe me, they are there, and if  patient\nand careful,  be able to see them.\" \n\n\nThen he added as an afterthought,  \" Otherwise why do you\nthink I carry this ray-gun around\"  \n\n \n\n \" But surely there aren't any dangerous species.\"\n \n\n \n\n \"  not worried about being attacked,\"\n he laughed.\n\n\n \" You see, I do the hunting.\"  \n\n \n\nI kept silent awhile.\n\n\nHunting, I knew, was the killing of lower species by primitive man\nfor food, and later, as a sport.\n\n\nI had even played a vid-game called  ` Fox-Hunt'  ,\nbut found it rather silly. \n\n \n\n \" You mean <*> dotted line</*> you kill these creatures\n<*> dotted line</*> for <*> dotted line</*> nothing?\" \n\n\nI was aghast. \n\n \n\n \" Of course not.\"  he said.\n\n\n \" I merely exercise my skill in the use of the ray-gun:\nhunting is a test of aim and dexterity and timing.\n\n\nSomething like what you do when you massacre alien invaders on your\nvid-game screens.\"  \n\n \n\n \" But all that isn't real,\"  I protested.\n\n\n \" Isn't it cruel to take life just for amusement.\n\n\nAs a pastime ?\n\n\nIt doesn't seem right somehow.\"  \n\n \n\n \" Ah, but  not intending any cruelty.\n\n\nJust as the accidents and diseases that kill us humans have no\nmalicious intent.\n\n\nTo the creatures I kill I am merely a misfortune, a disaster\nordained from above.\n\n\nSomething they can never know of, let alone predict or avoid.\"\n \n\n \n\nI was sceptical.\n\n\n \" What great skill does it need to point a ray-gun and\ndepress a trigger?\"  \n\n \n\n \" No, no.\n\n\nYou misunderstand.\n\n\n not testing myself or my weapons against lowly\ncreatures.\n\n\n far above all that.\n\n\nI kill, you see,\"  he said solemnly,  \" in order to\nplay God.\"  \n\n \n\nGod.\n\n\nThe primal myth of an unknowable force up on high that was supposed\nto reward good and punish sin, something to hold responsible for random\nmisfortune.\n\n\nToday, the word survives only in cliches and expletives.\n\n\nWas Inderson being serious, I wondered. \n\n \n\nHe explained:  \" The only creature on Jungle large enough\nto be worth killing is a lizardoid.\n\n\nIt preys on a bugoid which it kills by spitting an instantly acting\ncontact toxin.\n\n\nAt that  very instant, I blast out the  brains.\n\n\nI am the  nemesis, instantly wreaking a\nmathematically precise retribution.\n\n\nThe lizardoid is killed as it kills, the moment it kills: in effect,\nthe killer kills itself.\n\n\nA prompt punishment tailored to fit the crime.\n\n\nWhat God can be so just?\"  \n\n \n\nHe laughed, but I knew he meant it.\n\n\n \"  all a game, of course,\"  he said,\neyes twinkling.\n\n\n \"  sure  like to try it.\" \n\n\n \n\nHe didn't seem to want an answer. \n\n \n\nThe next day, after lunch, he reached for the gun rack and\ncalled me.\n\n\nHe shouldered a ray-gun and handed me one.\n\n\nHad he asked me, I might have refused, but he seemed to take it for\ngranted that I wanted a go at his game.\n\n\nWith the decision having been made for me, I began to look forward\nto this intriguing pastime of his. \n\n \n\nThe bugoid, he explained, lived on a jipweed and fed on its\naxillary buds.\n\n\nA lizardoid intending to dine on the bugoid would approach\nstealthily along the drainage grooves that ran down the jipweed branch to its\naxil.\n\n\nIt moved in sudden short bursts of speed and then suddenly froze\nwhen it was within spitting range.\n\n\nIt would then puff its cheeks and spit out the deadly gob of\npoisonous froth that would kill the bugoid on contact.\n\n\nIt would then clamber down to dinner. \n\n \n\nThe aim of the game was to render both the deaths of the\npredator and its prey simultaneous.\n\n\nSpitting distance, as judged by the lizardoid, varied considerably.\n\n\nThe puffing of its cheeks just prior to spitting was a cue, but a\nvariable amount of time had to be allowed for the frothy saliva to float\nacross what that particular lizardoid judged to be optimum spitting range.\n\n\nEnsuring that the ray reached the lizardoid the instant its spit\nreached the bugoid required split-second timing of an exquisite degree. \n\n \n\n \"  know  done it right\nwhen you see the gob of spit smother the bugoid the moment you hear the  skull burst,\"  Inderson said.\n\n\n \"  an indescribably exhilarating sense of\naccomplishment, I tell you.\n\n\nA sport fit for Gods.\"  \n\n \n\nInderson showed me how to approach a jipweed stealthily, using\nsheets of paper as stepping stones to silence the noisy sticking squelches\nthe wet soil made underfoot.\n\n\nHe showed me how to move in slow-motion and how to breathe away, so\nas to avoid setting up draughts that a bugoid could sense.\n\n\nAnd indeed, the forest suddenly seemed to be crawling with life.\n\n\n \n\nThree of five jipweeds I approached had brown crusty bugoids\nchomping away at the axillary buds.\n\n\nIt was a wonder I thought that the jipweed could grow at all.\n\n\nThe slightest sound, even a breath midirected towards it, would send\nthe bugoid scuttling for its burrow down the jipweed stem.\n\n\nThe sixth jipweed I sneaked up to revealed a pimply, green lizardoid\nstalking a bugoid.\n\n\nI inched myself into position hardly daring to breathe.\n\n\nThe lizardoid advanced like a clockwork toy with a faulty ratchet\nuntil it got, I felt, a bit too close.\n\n\nThe bugoid must have been very short-sighted, for it chomped on,\nunsuspecting. \n\n \n\nKneeling, I sighted the ray-gun down the branch.\n\n\nI lost sight of all else, caught up as I was in the thrill of the\nhunt.\n\n\nMy world shrank to the gunsight and the  occiput\non which it was trained.\n\n\nI was sure the next move would be a spit.\n\n\nThe bugoid was so close that the time lag would be negligible and,\njust possibly,  be able to coincide both deaths exactly. \n\n \n\nI was possessed by the spirit of the game.\n\n\nKill I willed the lizardoid; kill and be killed !\n\n\nI held life in the crook of my finger.\n\n\nI was the God of the world on the jipweed, poised to hurl down the\nultimate punishment for the ultimate crime, at the moment of commission <*>\ndotted line</*> \n\n \n\nThe  cheeks puffed out but, unaccountably,\ninstead of squeezing the trigger, I looked back. \n\n \n\nJust in time to see  ray-gun aimed at the\nlizardoid, through my head. \n\n \n\nAnd just in time to see a bolt of lightning lance down through\nthe caopy of leaves above towards  head.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fc22d485-93b7-4322-8758-c7dec44bee67", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.158553+00:00"}

{"text": "Literature : A Quest for Aesthetics of Liberty  \n\n\n\nDR. B. GOPAL RAO\n\n \n\nIt is the function of the fine arts to provide us with pleasure,\nbut pleasure of a distinctive kind and quality.\n\n\nLife offers many pleasures that are different in kind and are not here\nin question.\n\n\nThe kind of pleasure provided by the fine arts is called aesthetic.\n\n\nThe term is not easy to define, and ever since Aristotle,\ntwentythree centuries ago, attempted to analyse the nature of the\naesthetic experience, philosophers and art critics have continued to debate\nabout it.\n\n\nNevertheless, even though we are as far away as ever from\nunderstanding why the arts affect us as they do, the fact is uncontested that\nin the presence of objects of art something happens to alter the quality of\nour consciousness.\n\n\nThere is a marked intensification of the feeling-element, so marked\non occasion that it may even produce physical reactions, such as the thrill\nwhich runs up the spine, or the inhibiting for a time of all other sensuous\nexperience.\n\n\nThe fine frenzy which possessed the artist at the moment of creation\nis in some degree reproduced in the observer. \n\n \n\nThough the emotive nature of aesthetic experience is a matter of\ncontroversy today, many would concede that the art object does induce an\nevocation of the emotional side which our own experience corroborates.\n\n\nMany would agree, in this regard, with what Leo Tolstoy says : \n\n\n \n\nTo evoke in oneself a feeling one has experienced, and having\nevoked it in oneself, then, by means of movements, lines, colours, sounds, or\nforms expressed in words, so as to transmit that feeling that others may\nexperience the same feeling.\n\n\nIt is the activity of art <*> dotted line</*>\n\n\nIt is a means of union among men, joining them together in the same\nfeelings, and indispensable for the life and progress towards wellbeing of\nindividuals and of humanity.      \n\n \n\nAesthetic pleasure, then, is a function of feeling.\n\n\nWe have under the influence of great art a sensation of living more\nabundantly.\n\n\nSome deep-down levels of our personalities, normally quiescent, are\nstirred so that we suddenly become more fully aware of ourselves and of the\npossibilities that lie in us.\n\n\nThrough art the spirit of man is liberated from a concern with the\npractical issues of life, and he stretches his hands towards the ideal.\n\n\nAs susanne K. Langer has rightly pointed out:  \" Art is the\nsurest affidavit that feeling, despite its absolute privacy, repeats itself\nin each individual life\"  .    \n\n \n\nLiterature is concerned not only with what is, but how it came to\nbe what it is, and also with what it is in the process of becoming.\n\n\nIt compares and contrasts, seeks analogies, makes judgments, explores\nthe significances of things.\n\n\nThere are no regions of experience or speculation into which\nliterature does not penetrate and gather sustenance for the imagination. \n\n \n\nAmong all the arts, therefore, literature, invading time and\nspace like a monarch, enjoys the widest franchise and wields the greatest\npower.\n\n\nSeeing the end in the beginning and the beginning in the end, it can\nmove in all directions at once.\n\n\nIt can bid us use our reason to follow a patient analysis of cause\nand effect, or it can, in a single flash of imaginative insight, illuminate\nthe universe for us.\n\n\nThis is the reason why Indian aestheticians argue that art gives us\nthe privilege which only the gods and angels have: witnessing the artistic\nexperience without getting personally involved in it.\n\n\nAs Ananda Coomaraswamy discussing art in Indian life says  \"\n<*> dotted line</*> art reflects and answers to  every need,\nwhether of affirmation (   pravritti   ) or denial (\n  nivritti   ) being no less for the spectator than\nthe artist a way (   marga   ) <*> dotted line</*>\"\n .    \n\n \n\nLiterature is the art which helps each one of us to create for\nhimself a mental counterpart to the world of sense, a private universe of\nthought and feeling in which one may move freely and at ease, and which for\nmany is far more vivid and palpable than the universe of things. \n\n \n\nLiterary modes of expression are generally considered to be\ncyclical alterations of human attitudes to the environment.\n\n\nMore often than not, it is forgotten that literature itself is an\neducation, a refinement of the human mind, interpreting human spirit in terms\nof beauty.\n\n\nOften literary categories are classified as Classicism or\nRomanticism, Realism or Naturalism, without realising that these expressions\nbasically mean a certain kind of  endeavour on the\npart of the human spirit.\n\n\nThe literary embellishment in which this effort is expressed has a\ntendency to erect these categories as selfsufficient entities without any\nrelation to the basic impulses that give rise to them.\n\n\nHence we find literary discussion defining terms without realising\nthat ultimately they imply urges of the mind that are constantly seeking\ncreative selfexpression at once free and unrestricted. \n\n \n\nWhen the Romantic movement began to take shape with the\npublication of  \" The Lyrical Ballads \"  , ( 1798)\nof Wordsworth and Coleridge, it was taken to be a reaction to the 18th\ncentury age of reason.\n\n\nThat it meant the quest for liberty which was denied by the restraint\nof reason was hardly comprehended.\n\n\nIn fact, literature has always been a struggle to escape the bondages\nunder which life labours in its practical preoccupations.\n\n\nIt is true that on the level of day-to-day existence the\nconsiderations of practical life have to be paramount.\n\n\nBut man is fundamentally an incarnate isolation, being essentially\nseparated from others by his corporeal individuality.\n\n\nIn realising and asserting this individuality lies the freedom and\nauthenticity of human existence.\n\n\nHence the human spirit always breaks out in rebellion against every\nform of restraint and tries to be free and uncontrolled.\n\n\nAs we cast a glance at the literary history of the western world, we\nrealise that literature has always been a quest for liberty in spite of\ncertain periods during which restraint became the dominant note of literary\ncreation. \n\n \n\nThe Grecian world was basically an individualistic world in spite\nof the city states and the social consciousness that governed it.\n\n\nHomer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, or Euripides represent the\nindividualistic heroism of the Greek mind achieving tragic majesty by defying\nevery restriction, imposed not only by the society but also by Moira, the\ndeity of Fate herself.\n\n\nBreaking away from bondage and experiencing the highest reach of\nhuman power in physical or spiritual spheres was the ideal that inspired the\nGreek heroes.\n\n\nFor them the world was a prize to be conquered by the might of  own self by setting at nought the opposing will of even Zeus\nhimself.\n\n\nThis quest of might underwent a radical disintegration, during the\none Hellenistic period, when the pursuit of might turned to pursuit of\npleasure on the one hand and pursuit of ascetic cynicism on the other.\n\n\nEven this expression of the self was a form of realizing  possibilities after having arrived at one ultimate in the heroic\ndirection.\n\n\nInevitably the Roman world brought in the Stoic restraint and the\nAugustan law and order.\n\n\nBut the Latin literature was also a quest of realizing the\nunrestricted integration that the mind is  capable of\nrestraint for the sake of restraint ends in literature that is without the\nvitality of the spirit and turns out to be a kind of preaching or propaganda\nthat lacks the creative impulse. \n\n \n\nThe Medieval world was essentially restricted in its theological\noutlook and as a result gave rise to a Chivalric literature that sought\nfreedom in heroism and love.\n\n\nThe tension between the Medieval theology and the Chivalric impulse\nconstitutes one of the major illustrations of the literary urge for freedom\nin spite of oppressive social bondage. \n\n \n\nThe Renaissance asserted the right of man for absolute physical\nfreedom even to the highest tragic extent.\n\n\n plays indicated  lust for\npower,  lust for knowledge, the Jew of \nlust for splendour and Hero and  lust for passion.\n\n\nUnrestricted outward plunge into space from the earlier theological\nconfinment marked the Renaissance quest for liberty.\n\n\nWhen this external adventure grew sadistic and masochistic, the age\nof reason stepped in to control the disintegration and contribute a new\ndimension in selfintegration.\n\n\nBy accident the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries supported the\nrational orientation of integration by discovering a universe characterized\nby law and order.\n\n\nBut it was soon realised that the restraint of integration has a\ntendency to suppress the impulses and it was no surprise that the Romantic\nwave set in with a view to transcending every restriction.\n\n\nWordsworth, Coleridge and Scott sought a physical orientation by\nidentifying themselves with the multiplicity of nature the supernatural and\nthe historically remote.\n\n\nByron, Shelley and Keats went still beyond and sought a spiritual\nfreedom through egoism, mystical love, and pagan identification with the\nsensuous and the concrete.\n\n\nThe Romantic age indicated  essential character\nto seek liberty and found that with the restraining society that was\nemerging, literature was never to be at ease in the social practical sphere.\n\n\nThe literary man began to find himself alienated and an outsider.\n\n\n \n\nSince the 19th century, the individual artist has realized that\nhe is a unique existent and that his genuiness lies not in conformity but in\nauthentic freedom of experience and expression.\n\n\nThe literature of today is basically turning to extentialism because\nof the human  uncompromising quest for freedom.\n\n\nIt is only when we realize the character of literature as quest for\nliberty that we begin to under stand the nature and dimensions of literary\nterms.  \n\n\n References   1.\n\n\nLeo Tolstoy,  \" What is Art ? \" Tr by Aylmer\nMande ( Oxford University Press, 1905. p. 86. )   2.\n\n\nSusanne K.

{"text": "Short story \n\n\nby  Tanushree Podder \n\n\n   A CHANGE OF   HEART   \n\n \n\n Mrs  Rukmini Iyer grumbled incessantly as she peeled\nand chopped the small onions for her  sambar  .\n\n\nThe tears in her eyes were not due to the pungence of the onions.\n\n\nThey were tears of frustration and rage. \n\n \n\n \" How could he do this after all I have done for him?\"\n she lamented.\n\n\n \" It is my misfortune that I gave birth to such a stupid boy.\"\n \n\n \n\nShe wiped the tears away with the corner of her  pallu\n and continued chopping the vegetables with uncharacteristic\nviolence. \n\n \n\n \" If only Nandu had told me to find a good bride for him,\nI would have lined up at least 20 girls for his approval.\n\n\nAfter all, he is so good-looking, fair and intelligent and is working\nin the USA.\n\n\nBut he had to go and get married to some hussy there!\"  \n\n \n\n tears continued to flow unabated. \n\n \n\nNarasimha, lovingly called Nandu by everyone, was her only son.\n\n\nHe was a neuro-surgeon working in the USA.\n\n\nRukmini, his mother, had brought him up all by herself after the\ndeath of her husband.\n\n\nNarasimha had never seen his  grief or cry.\n\n\nShe was a strong woman who had struggled against all odds to educate\nhim in the best of schools and put him through medical college. \n\n \n\nHe had been a brilliant student who had always earned\nscholarships throughout his academic career.\n\n\nHe loved and adored his mother and declared to everyone that she was\nhis ideal in every way. \n\n \n\nIt had been a tough decision for him when he had to leave his\nmother alone and go to the USA for specialisation in neuro-surgery. \n\n\n \" I will stay here and do whatever I can,\"  he had\ninsisted.\n\n \n\n \" You will do nothing of the sort.\n\n\nI am healthy and strong.\n\n\nI can stay by myself.\n\n\nYou must not forget that your father had always wanted you to be a\nsurgeon.\n\n\nIt is our duty to fulfil his wishes.\n\n\nI have worked so hard to fulfil that dream and now you are telling me\nthat you won't go for your specialisation!\" \n\n\nRukmini had been furious. \n\n \n\nAll through his childhood and youth, Narasimha had struggled to\nfulfil the dreams of his parents.\n\n\nHe had worked hard day and night so that he could excel in his\nstudies. \n\n\n \" But Amma, I won't feel comfortable leaving you all alone.\"\n\n\n\n \" I won't listen to anything.\n\n\nYou must go and finish your specialisation.\" \n\n \n\nShe had literally thrown him out of the house!\n\n\nAnd then Narasimha had excelled in his specialisation just as he had\nalways excelled in everything he did.\n\n\nHe had gone on to become a renowned neurosurgeon in New York. \n\n \n\nHis zeal to achieve excellence had been triggered in his\nchildhood by the tragic demise of his father.\n\n\n father had suffered brain haemorrhage after a\nroad accident and died because he had not been operated upon by a good\nneuro-srugeon.\n\n\nThen and there Rukmini had decided that her son would be a\nneuro-surgeon, and the best one in the country. \n\n \n\nAfter finishing his specialisation Narasimha had no problem\ngetting a job in one of the best hospitals in New York.\n\n\nHe had taken an apartment and bought all the luxuries of life,\nincluding a fancy car. \n\n \n\nHe had installed a phone in the house at Bangalore and spoke to\nhis mother every week, without fail.\n\n\nHe had also got the old cottage redone by an interior decorator and\nprovided a lot of luxuries for his mother. \n\n \n\n \" Why are you wasting so much money?\" \n\n\nRukmini had asked, peeved at the expenses of it all.\n\n\n \" I am quite comfortable living the way I have always\nlived.\"  \n\n \n\n   \"  I don't need a well-furnished,\nmodern house nor do I know how to use half the gadgets you have installed in\nthe house.\n\n\nI don't even need the telephone.\"  \n\n \n\n \" But I need it.\n\n\nI am constantly worrying about you.\n\n\nIf I speak to you on the phone I feel relieved.\n\n\nAs for the gadgets they are quite easy to operate, \nteach you how to operate them.\n\n\nAt this age, you can't still be using the grinding    stone for everything.\" \n\n\n \n\nThe only thing Rukmini enjoyed was the colour television and the\ndish antenna.\n\n\nShe loved switching channels and watching programmes all through the\nday and late into the night.\n\n\nIt helped her pass time and fight the loneliness that was creeping in\nwith age. \n\n \n\n Things  had been going very well for them.\n\n\nOnce Narasimha had established himself, he asked Rukmini to join him.\n\n\nAlthough Rukmini was not very keen on leaving the country, she was\nseized with a desire to see the success of her brilliant son and enjoy the\nimportance of being the mother of a renowned surgeon. \n\n \n\nRukmini hated the idea of flying, she did not trust aeroplanes.\n\n\n \n\n  \"  If there is an accident on land, one can at\nleast hope to escape with  life but if one falls from the sky,\nwhat chances does one have?\"  she would ask her son. \n\n \n\n \" Oh  Amma  ! One doesn't fall from the\nsky and there won't be an aircrash.\n\n\nDon't worry!\"  Narasimha had assured her. \n\n \n\nAt last Rukimini had relented and agreed to visit her son.\n\n\nIt had been 5 years since her son had gone to the USA and she was\nquite keen to see the way he lived. \n\n \n\nNarasimha also wanted his mother to stay with him at New York.\n\n\nHe had been worried about her failing health and wanted to keep her\nwith him. \n\n \n\nRukmini was enraptured by the cleanliness and bustle around her\nas she landed at the J F Kennedy Airport where her dutiful son was waiting to\nreceive her. \n\n \n\n \" I must say that America is a very clean place,\"\n she remarked.\n\n\n \" Neither the Bangalore airport nor the Chennai airport was\nas clean.\"  \n\n \n\nNarasimha smiled as he loaded her luggage into his car and drove\nher to his apartment. \n\n \n\nRukmini was spellbound by the sights.\n\n\nShe was like a little child who had been taken to a big fair.\n\n\nHer son was amused at the way his mother reacted to everything. \n\n\n \" You will enjoy living here,  Amma  , \"\n he said.\n\n \n\nWhen they reached the apartment block where Narasimha lived, he\nsaid hesitantly,  \"  Amma  , I have a surprise for\nyou.\"  \n\n \n\nThe note in his voice made his mother suspicious. \n\n \n\n Rukmini  stared sharply at him as they rode the\nelevator to the twenty-third floor.\n\n\nNarasimha avoided her stare and fiddled with the luggage. \n\n \n\nHe rang the doorbell and the door was thrown open by a young\nAmerican woman.\n\n\nShe bent down and touched  feet.\n\n\nRukmini shot a look at her son and asked,  \" Nandu, I hope\nthis is not the surprise you were speaking about.\"  \n\n \n\nHer son looked sheepish and said,  \"  Amma \n, this is Linda.\n\n\nShe is a gynaecologist in my hospital.\n\n\nWe got married last month.\"  \n\n \n\nSeeing the horrified look on his  face, he\nrushed to explain,  \" She is a very nice person  Amma  .\n\n\nYou will not have any problems with her.\"  \n\n \n\nWith all the strength she could muster, Rukmini slapped her son.\n\n\nThere was a stunned silence as both Linda and Narasimha looked at\neach other.\n\n\nThe next moment Rukmini broke into loud sobs. \n\n \n\nLinda quickly rushed in and brought a glass of water for Rukmini\nbut she refused to touch it. \n\n \n\n \" Do you think I will drink water served by this woman\nand forget the rules of my religion?\"  she \nasked. \n\n \n\nNarasimha looked totally aghast.\n\n\nHe had not anticipated such a violent reaction from his mother.\n\n\nHe had not informed his mothere about the marriage because he knew\nthat she would not understand his feelings for Linda.\n\n\nIt was difficult trying to tell her about such matters on the phone.\n\n\n \n\n He  had expected things to be set right when Rukmini\ncame and stayed with them.\n\n\nHe had warned Linda that things may not be easy but she was now\nflabbergasted.\n\n\nThe little old lady was much tougher than she had expected. \n\n \n\n \" I am not going to stay here.\n\n\nNandu, put me on the next flight to India.\"  \n\n \n\nNo amount of convincing, cajoling or compelling had worked.\n\n\nRukmini was a stubborn woman and none of  pleas\nhad worked.\n\n\nShe refused to eat at the same table with Linda and treated her like\nan untouchable. \n\n \n\n \" I should have gone away for sometime and come back\nwhen she had settled down.\n\n\nI think we handled it all wrong,\"  said Linda.\n\n\n \" Maybe it was too much for her to handle.\n\n\nArriving to a new place and then the shock of finding her son\nmarried to a white woman.\"  \n\n \n\n \" No Linda, it was not your fault.\n\n\nI should have broken the news gradually and gently.\n\n\nYou are right, the shock of landing in an alien place and finding me\nmarried, was too much for her,\"  admitted Narasimha. \n\n \n\nIn the meantime, Rukmini refused to eat anything that Linda had\ncooked. \n\n \n\n \" We are lyers, Brahmins of the highest order.\n\n\nHow can you expect me to accept a woman whom we treat as\nuntouchable?\n\n\nThank God your father is not alive.\n\n\nHe would have died of shock if he were alive,\"  she scolded\nher son. \n\n \n\nNarasimha knew his  stubbornness.\n\n\nHe knew that she would not relent and that there was no point in\ntrying to force her to.\n\n\nWhen all his pleas failed, he bought her a ticket to go back to\nIndia. \n\n \n\n \"  Amma  , when you go back, give this\ncareful thought.\n\n\nLinda is a good woman and I love her very much.\n\n\nWe are married now.\n\n\nEven if I have done something wrong, you must forgive me.\n\n\nI want you to come and live with us.\"  \n\n \n\n \" Never!\"  said Rukmini vehemently.\n\n\n \" I will never live with you.\n\n\nI don't want your money, either.\n\n\nI will go back to Bangalore and live on my own.\n\n\nYou don't have to worry about me.\"  \n\n \n\nAnd Rukmini had gone back to her old house at Bangalore.\n\n\nAll her life she had been a staunch Brahmin, observing all the rules\nand rituals of the religion.\n\n\nShe could not change them, now.\n\n\nNarasimha tried to explain things to her in a long letter, he also\ncalled her up, repeatedly.\n\n\nBut the stubborn old lady refused to relent.\n\n\nShe did not touch the money sent by her son, either.\n\n\nIt was a friend who suggested that she should rent out the 2-room\nunit on the first floor. \n\n \n\n \" You will get enough rent to live comfortably and  have company, too.\n\n\nAs it is, the rooms are lying vacant.\"  \n\n \n\n \" But I will only rent it out to a bachelor or a young\ngirl.\n\n\nI don't want a family staying in those 2 rooms, what with the water\nshortage and other problems,\"  she decided. \n\n \n\nRukmini put in an add in the Sunday newspaper.\n\n\nA steady stream of hopefuls had trooped in to see the place.\n\n\nRukmini was determined that the rooms would go to a vegetarian\nBrahmin only.\n\n\nThat had narrowed down the choice considerably.\n\n\nShe had spoken to about 10 persons but didn't find anyone she liked.\n\n\n \n\nIt was towards the evening that a young man approached her.\n\n\nHe reminded her of Nandu.\n\n\nShe couldn't put her finger on it but there was something very\nfamiliar about the fellow. \n\n\n \" What is your name, young man?\"  she asked gruffly.\n\n\n \" My name is Narendra,\"  said the young man.\n\n \n\nHe was desperate.\n\n\nHe had heard about the rooms and also about the preconditions that\nmust be fulfilled in order to get them.\n\n\nHis name was not Narendra, it was Neil.\n\n\nBut he lied so that he could take the rooms on rent. \n\n \n\nHe had been house-hunting for one whole week and if he didn't\nfind one in another 2 days, he would have to go back to his village, leaving\nthe plum job that he was getting. \n\n\n \" Which State do you belong to?\"  asked Rukmini.\n\n\n \" I am a Goan,\"  he replied.\n\n\n \" But Goans are mostly Christians,\"  she stated\nsuspiciously.\n\n\n \" No.\n\n\nI belong to a Saraswat Brahmin family.\n\n\nMy grandfather settled down in Goa.\" \n\n\n \" I hope you do not eat non-vegetarian food,\" \nprobed Rukmini.\n\n\n \" Never.\n\n\nI am a pure vegetarian.\" \n\n \n\n \" I will give you the rooms on rent but you have to\nabide by a few rules.\n\n\nFirst, I do not like loud music, so you will not play music loudly;\nsecondly, you will return home by a reasonable hour because the gate is\ncommon to both of us and I like to lock it by 10 PM.\"  \n\n \n\n  \"   Thirdly , I do not want you to\nmess up your place.\n\n\nYou will keep it scrupulously clean and well-maintained.\n\n\nFourthly, you will not invite any of your friends or relatives here.\n\n\nFifthly <*> dotted line</*>\"  \n\n \n\n \" Anything you say is all right by me.\n\n\nI will abide by all your rules.\n\n\nPlease do not worry,\"  interrupted Neil. \n\n \n\n \" Well, then you must pay me an    advance of Rs. 4,500 which is equal\nto 3  rent.\n\n\nOnce you pay the amount, I will give you the keys.\n\n\nBut remember, young man, if you break any of my rules, I will throw\nyou out of the house.\"  \n\n \n\nNeil smiled mischievously and replied,  \" I will never\ngive you the opportunity to do so.\"  \n\n \n\nHe shifted in, bag and baggage, the next day.\n\n\nHe was very careful not to give her a chance to

{"text": "The Grapvine communication  \n\n \n\nGrapevine communication means \" a vine on which Grapes are\ngrown \" similarly it is a line on which communication flows.\n\n\nIt is also known as    a   secret\ncommunication.\n\n\nBoth the meanings can be applied to it. \n\n \n\nGrapevine communication it  means  an unofficial,\ninformal and unorganised form of communication which helps to spread the\nmessage quickly among the workers.\n\n\nIt spreads in any direction like that of a vine of grape.\n\n\nAs it is  informal communication it spreads in any\ndirection and carries message that is partially true, fully true or\ncompletely false. \n\n \n\nGrapevine communication is harmful as well as useful.\n\n\nIt is harmful when it carries wrong information and so  \n a   good management always keeps an eye of the flow of\ncommunication through the Grapvine. \n\n \n\nGrapevine is useful in 2 ways\n\n\n1) It is an indicator or    a   barometer of\nthe morale of the workers and    in   the event if\nthe morale is poor, measures can be taken to raise it.\n\n\n2) It is like a vent, exit and outflow of the tension and worries of\nthe workers which has an effect on the work performance.\n\n\nSo grapevine    relieves   the workers\nof their tension and worries. \n\n\n The Technique of Using Grapevine \n\n \n\nThis type of communication is useful to send some  types of information.\n\n\nThe officer calls the individual into his cabin and while talking\nabout other matters reveals the information that  he\nwants to pass on.\n\n\nHe makes it a point to tell the person that he is the most reliable\nperson in the organisation and    requests  \nhim to keep the message    a   secret.\n\n\nBut when the person goes out of the  cabin he has\nan urge to tell the others especially his  ` Best Friend' \nand so he tell him, his best friend tells the other person.\n\n\nThus, the message  which is considered to be a\nsecret is no longer a secret. \n\n \n\nThe Grapevine can carry only a few type of informations like\n\n\n1) It can carry on fresh message\n\n\n2) People like to talk about other people as human beings are the\nmost interesting topic for discussion\n\n\n3) The staff usually    talk   about\nfashion, films, leave, Bonus, promotion etc. \n\n \n\nThe Grapevine is also helpful to spread important information but\nit should be regularly checked.\n\n\nIf it carries any false information    then \n the management can    countercheck  \nit by passing the correct information through formal medium of communication\nlike circulars, notices etc.\n\n\nBut sometimes it is found that it is not useful and so the management\ncan use the same medium that is the Grapevine to spread the correct and true\ninformation.\n\n\nGrapevine is also useful to check the morale of the workers and\n any false message in the Grapevine is necessarily to be\ncounterchecked.  \n\n \n\n\n  Socio-psychological barriers  \n\n \n\nThe main objective of communication is that    it   should be received completely received by the other\nperson so we make a number of    preparations \n but still we find that something goes wrong and the message is partly\nreceived or partially received and sometimes misunderstood.\n\n\nThis is because of the number of barriers which interfere in the\nsmooth flow of communication.\n\n\nIt is necessary to find these barriers and overcome them. \n\n \n\nThe different types of barriers are : \n\n\n1) Physical Barrier\n\n\n2) Language Barrier\n\n\n3) Socio-psychological Barrier \n\n \n\nThe third type of barrier that is \" the\nsocio-psychological Barrier \" come into   \nexistence   because of the nature, mood, habits, personality and\nemotions of the human beings.\n\n\nThese factors from both the sides that is from the       side as well as from the       side destroy, \nand disturb the communication.\n\n\nThe sender sends the message    according \n to his idea and understanding and the receiver receives the message\naccording to his feelings, moods and his understanding and they both differ\nbecause two human    beings   are never alike.\n\n\nTwo types of important socio-psychological barriers are :\n\n\n1)   Closed Mind  - - \n\n\n\" Closed Mind \" is an important type of\nsocio-psychological barrier and it is mostly seen in an organisation.\n\n\n Many a times the superiors in the organisation\nconsider themselves to be superior to the others in understanding and\nknowledge he thinks that whatever he knows is enough and right and he is not\nready to listen to others or understand others or accept new ideas.\n\n\nThis mainly causes a problem to the new entrants in the organisation\nwho are young and fresh and they have their own ideas which are modern and\nscientific.\n\n\nBut due to the closed mind of the    superiors\n  they are never given a chance to express themselves.\n\n\nIt is found that closed mindedness exists because of some deep rooted\nfear or prejudice and therefore it is necessary to detect the cause for this\nclosed-mind and act accordingly.\n\n\n2)   Status Barrier  - - \n\n\nThis Status Barrier also exists in the organisation due to the\ndifference in the post.\n\n\nThere are Groups of Superiors and   \nsubordinates.  \n\n\nThe superiors are ranked higher and so they kind of dominate over the\n   subordinates.  \n\n\nSometimes the    subordinates \n change their    opinion   on\ncertain matters in order to please their superiors.\n\n\nThe    subordinates   are\nusually  afraid of the superiors and do not take their\nproblems and    grievances   to them.\n\n\nThus this status barrier can be removed by encouraging upward\ncommunication - -    the   different ways of\nremoving the status barriers are : \n\n\n1) Encouraging Two-way communication\n\n\n2) The superiors should have an openmind on matters\n\n\n3) Get-togethers like picnic, parties, sports activities    etc.,   should be encouraged.\n\n\n4) The superiors should know the     subordinates   at an informal level.\n\n\n5)  The superiors should encourage the    subordinates   to give suggestions on\ndifferent matters and participate in meetings.\n\n\n6) The special formalities and services should be eliminated like\nair-condition facilities etc. \n\n \n\nThis Rank difference cannot be abolished all together but can\nbe removed to some extent by using the above mentioned methods.  \n\n \n\n \n\nLouis Allen defines communication as \"  \n a   bridge of meaning \" .\n\n\nIt involves a systamatic and continuous process of telling,\nunderstanding and listening.\n\n\nThus communication is a two way process and \" listening\n\" is the other half of communication.\n\n\n\" Listening \" is done with the mind and therefore it\nis an active process, it involves the eyes, the ears, and mind.\n\n\n\" Listening \" is something different    from   \" hearing \" ; it involves both\n\" hearing \" and \" thinking \" .\n\n\nIt is said that a good listener is a good communicator.\n\n\nIf people stop listening there is no use of talking. \n\n\n  The obstacles to listening  : -  \n\n\n1)  Physical  : -\n\n \n\nIt is seen that the listener is always disturbed by physical\nbarriers like noise and sometimes even by the       appearance and gestures \n\n\n2)  Language  : -\n\n \n\nIt is found that sometimes the language that the speaker speaks\n is not understood by the listener.\n\n\nBut sometimes listening is obstructed because of the language use.\n\n\nThe speaker may be too high and sometimes due to the faulty\npronunciation and accent of the speaker. \n\n \n\n3) It is observed the  mind of the listener works\nfaster than the tongue of the speaker and so there is a space or gap between\nthe speech and reception.    During  \nthis time the listener starts day dreaming yawning as a result of which\nlistening is affected. \n\n\n  4) Pre-convinced ideas  : - \n\n \n\nSometimes the listeners have pre-convinced ideas that the subject\nor the speaker is boring and so he does not make an attempt to listen. \n\n \n\n5) Sometimes the listener finds it difficult to understand and he\nsometimes listens only to the things which he wants to \nlisten    according   to his needs, beliefs,\nideas etc.\n\n\nOver stimulation or over excitement also reduces the  listening capacity as the process becomes slower and so the\nlistening is greatly affected. \n\n\n  6) Pre-occupied mind  : - \n\n \n\nIt is often observed the mind of the listener is mostly occupied\nin other thoughts that he thinks about other things and not the  ideas of the topic under discussion. \n\n \n\n7) Sometimes the listener listens with his eyes closed and so he\nlistens only to the voice and words and not the feelings, ideas and\nexpressions behind them. \n\n \n\n8) Sometimes the listener is rather busy in pretending to listen\nrather than listening due to which listening does not go on well.\n\n\nSometimes the listening is affected because the listener is mentally\nor physically tired. \n\n\n  Ways to remove obstacles   \n\n \n\n1) Try not be be    disturbed   and\ndistracted by the appearance and gestures of the speaker\n\n\n2) The time that is got between the process of speaking and listening\nutilise it in a better way to think of the subject in depth and not waste it\nin day-dreaming.\n\n\n3) Do not    be prejudiced,   give a\nfair chance to the speaker to express his views and   \nopinions.  \n\n\n   4)   Do not think of other things when\n you are listening and do not listen with your eyes closed\nbecause we may miss out the ideas and expressions behind that.\n\n\n   5)   Do not have pre-\n <-> concveid </- >  conceived   ideas because no person or\nsubject can be boring in the world and therefore try to listen properly and\ndevelop an interest.\n\n\n   6)   Listen to the entire speech  if you do not understand something do not   \ninterrupt   the speaker by the end of the speech you will have\nanswers to all the questions and if not ask him at the end.\n\n\n   7)   Listen with   \nempathy   rather than apathy.  \n\n \n\n\n  The Block form of Letter  \n\n \n\nToday the world business is growing at a rapid rate.\n\n\n   People   do not have time for each\nother and so in this rapidly advancing world  it  is necessary to keep\ncontacts  with others.\n\n\nToday most of  us  are  in  contact with other\npeople  through letters and thererfore letters play\n   a   very important role in   \nour   day to day social and business activities.\n\n\nThere are letters written in different form.  \n They   are : \n\n\n1) The Indented Form\n\n\n2) The Semi-block Form\n\n\n3) The Block Form\n\n\n4) The Fomplete Block Form\n\n\n5) The Hanging Indented Form\n\n\n6) The N.O.M.A forma \n\n \n\nOut of these, Block Form is the one which is usually used in the\nmodern business houses as it is  not  time consuming and looks\neffecient and effective.\n\n\nIn case of the Block form of the letter  writing\n\" the Date, Signature and Complimentary Close \" as usual are\nwritten on the left hand side.\n\n\nThe three to four spaces below the date on the left hand side the\n\" Inside Address \" is written.\n\n\nIn case of the indented form on the first line of \" the\ninside address \" is written  near the margin and the\nremaining lines are written in the indented form.\n\n\nBut in the block form the first line of \" the inside address\n\" is written near the margin and so also the remaining lines are\nwritten close to the margin.\n\n\n   There   is no indention and address\nis written with open    puntuation   that\nis the comma sign is not put    behind   every\nline that of the  indented form.\n\n\nThree to four spaces below \" the   \nInside   Address, the Salutation \" is written which usually\nbegins from close to the margin.\n\n\nThen comes the    body   of the letter\nwhich is written in \" the block form \" that is the starting\nline of each paragraph is written close to the margin without indention. \n\n \n\nThis is one of the time saving faster medium of    writing   the letters and is therefore adopted by most of\nthe business houses.  \n\n \n\n\n  Conciseness in a Business Letter  \n\n \n\nA Business letter is very important and essential and its\nwriting is also  very essential.\n\n\nThe    business   letter is    indispensable   as it represents you.\n\n\n The    business \n letter is    a   legal document, it is useful\nfor reference, it should have the persuasive function and it helps in\nincreasing the goodwill of the organisation. \n\n \n\nLanguage of the Business letter is a formal language and\ntherefore vague    definite   words\nshould not be used.\n\n\nTherefore a Business letter should be planned properly.\n\n\nFor writing of the business letter there are rules : they are four\nwords begining with \" C \" that guides the person in writing\nof the business letter they are :\n\n\n1) Correctness\n\n\n2) Completeness\n\n\n3) Clarity\n\n\n4) Conciseness \n\n \n\n\" Conciseness \" is very important in a business\nletter.\n\n\nConciseness means to the point or making the letter brief.\n\n\nTo observe conciseness in a business letter we should keep in mind\nthat  we  use a) Short words b) Short sentences c) familiar words\nd) correct words and exclude abstract words open to interpretation.\n\n\nThe  language should be simple for that not\nonly  for     an   educated man  to \nunderstand it but also    a   less\neducated man.\n\n\nIt should be always noted that a Business letter is  to  use\nto  \" Express\"  and not to  \" Impress\"  and\ntherefore use of long sentimental sentences, phrases etc., should be\navoided.\n\n\nThe language should be easy and  the  use of unfamiliar words\nshould be avoided like \" subsequent - - next terminate -\n- stop \" etc.\n\n\nTo make the letter concise active voice should be used as in the\nactive voice sentences are shorter. \n\n \n\nNew topics should begin in a new paragraph and there should be a\nproper link between the two    paragraphs  \nand to do this proper words like \" Although, However,\n\"  etc.\n\n\nWe should avoid the use of    redundant \n phrases like \" Reply to us by    early \n \"  \" post as early as possible\n\" here \" early as possible \" is not necessary,\n\" let us    cooperate together; \n \" here \"    together  \n\" is not important. \n\n \n\nBut    in order   to make the\nletter \" concise \" we should not omit important points in\nthe letter.\n\n\nIn case if the letter is too long, a

{"text": "Anti-poverty programmes  Who should benefit\n \n\n\n By Prof. Amartya Sen  \n\n \n\n THE topic relates to the conflicting\ndemands of targeting and universallism in poverty alleviation.\n\n\nThe basic argument in favour of strict targeting is clear enough.\n\n\nEfficient selection of beneficiaries reduces the cost of the support\nprogrammes.\n\n\nTransfers of income, support of subsidised food, free availability of\nhealth services and education, and other such programmes, all cost\nresources.\n\n\nThe costs of such programmes can be reduced if the beneficiaries are\nselected on some strict criterion of needs and the non-poor are excluded\nfrom having the benefit of such programmes.\n\n\nThat, in nutshell, is the main argument in favour of strict\ntargeting. \n\n \n\nHowever, targeting also involves some losses and costs, and the\npicture is far less simple than it might first appear.\n\n\nThe losses can be of various types.\n\n\nFirst there is the cost of administration and the expenses of\nbureaucracies in executing selection on the basis of a strict criterion of\nneeds.\n\n\nSecond, it is very hard to maintain the quality of services that are\nreserved only for the politically weak groups of the society, since they lack\nthe social power to monitor quality and ensure the soundness of the\nservices offered.\n\n\nFor example, health services reserved for the poor can rapidly\ndeteriorate.\n\n\nThird, there is some stigma associated with making use of\ntransfers that are meant only for the helpless indigent, and targeting can be\na rather demeaning process. \n\n \n\nThere are also some social costs of targeting with which\neconomists in particular have been much concerned.\n\n\nTo continue the list, the fourth argument to consider on the other\nside is the possibility of  \" informational distortion\"  .\n\n\nAny system of targeting the needy tends to produce attempts by\nsome to distort the relevant information to qualify to get the support.\n\n\nIn order to exclude such  \" non-genuine\" \napplicants, the scrutiny that is produced can quite easily lead to the\ndenial of support in genuine cases as well, since some of the relevant\ninformation about needs is hard to obtain and verify.\n\n\nIn trying to prevent what the statisticians would call the \n\" type 1\"  error of including some non-needy people in the category\nof the needy, some  \" type 2\"  errors are typically committed\nof excluding some really needy people from the actual beneficiaries. \n\n \n\nFifth, targeting also tends to produce  \" incentive\ndistortions\"  .\n\n\nPotential beneficiaries may adjust their work and other activities to\nqualify to get support, and the result of this can be a significant loss\nof social output and activity. \n\n \n\nFinally, an economy based on targeting can be a very  \"\ninvasive\"  one, involving constant policing and probing investigation\ninto the lives of the poorer sections of the community to make sure that they\nare genuinely poor enough.\n\n\nThe political consequences of such invasiveness can be quite\ndamaging, especially when the targets of investigation lack the political\nor economic power to stand up against it.\n\n\nNo matter how specific the criterion is, any need-based selection\ntends to give a good deal of power to the government officials over the\nlives of potential recipients.\n\n\nThe authority to select can make a minor official into a major\npotentate.\n\n\nThese social costs can be no less important than the financial\nexpenses of running a targeted programme. \n\n \n\nThe case for targeting is, thus, not so clear at all.\n\n\nAll these difficulties indicate that there is more to the\nprinciple of universalism than the simple theoretical argument for\ntargeting might suggest.\n\n\nCertainly, the case for universal coverage of elementary health\nservices and basic education is quite strong, both because these\nfacilities relate to what might be seen as basic rights to citizens, but\nalso because the losses and costs of selection can be quite enormous,\noutweighing the benefits to be derived from it. \n\n \n\nObviously, some types of selection are essential for the\ncogency of public policy.\n\n\nIf the aim is to vaccinate the children or to increase female\nliteracy, then surely policies must somehow concentrate on the\nunvaccinated kids and illiterate women.\n\n\nTo call that  \" targeting\"  may appeal to our love of\njargon, but the issue here is no more than making particular policies\nspecific and purposeful.\n\n\nLike Monsieur Jourdain in  play \"  Le\nBourgeois Gentilhomme  \" , who spoke prose without knowing\nit, we are, in some sense,  \" targeting\"  all the time if\nany selection of beneficiaries counts as that.\n\n\nGiving your daughter a book on her birthday can be seen as a case\nof targeting with extreme precision. \n\n \n\nThe real issue in the economics of targeting does not lie in the\nacceptance of the necessity to do some selection for purposeful and practical\neconomic and social policies.\n\n\nThe important questions lie elsewhere, to wit, how far to push the\nprocess of selection - - where to stop. \n\n \n\nDespite the case for universalism in dealing with basic health\nservices and elementary education, there are other areas in which the\nappropriate policies must depend on balancing the advantages of selection\nagainst the various costs and losses that I have tried to identify earlier.\n\n\nFor example, in evaluating programmes of nutritional support (\nsuch as mid-day meals for schoolchildren ) , note must be taken of the costs\nof covering all the school children of particular age groups.\n\n\nBut at the same time, the economic and social losses that would be\ninvolved in trying to select on some criterion of needs has also to be given\nadequate attention and importance.\n\n\nThe choice of where to draw the line must depend on taking an\nappropriately broad view of social and economic effects of alternative\npolicies. \n\n \n\nThere is also the possibility of making use of self-selection in\nsome cases.\n\n\nFor example, in providing relief from drought or flood, or dealing\nwith seasonal rural unemployment, a system of open unemployment policy at\na fixed wage rate attracts only those who are ready to put in the necessary\nwork to earn the corresponding income.\n\n\nSelf-selection becomes a part of the process in such cases, even\nthough the choice of where to offer such employment opportunities, for\nwhat work, at what wage, and so on, remain the subject of intelligent and\nsensitive public discussion. \n\n \n\nSelf-selection can be an important vehicle for providing\nservices in kind as well.\n\n\nFor example, medical services that are offered free can be used by\nthose who need it, but canot be resold to others or capitalised into\nfinancial gains in general.\n\n\nThe important issue here is the ability of the underdogs of the\nsociety to make use of these services as freely as the more fortunate\nmembers of the society tend to do.\n\n\nThis is partly a matter of social courage, of political\nuniversalism, and also of basic education.\n\n\nBy expanding elementary education from the deplorably low level at\nwhich it is in India today, use of public services by the poorer sections\nof the public can also be enhanced ( as  example in\nparticular brings out). \n\n \n\nI conclude with two final observations.\n\n\nFirst, it is important to see the beneficiaries of the poverty\nremoval programmes as active agents, and not merely as passive recipients of\nhand-outs.\n\n\nThe jargon of targeting suggests that the objects that are aimed at\nhave no volition, no will, no ability to respond.\n\n\nThat is the wrong way to pose the problem.\n\n\nThe first necessity is to see the potential beneficiaries as\n \" agents\"  rather than simply as  \" patients\"  .\n\n\nThe detailed arguments about social and economic losses and\nbenefits, discussed earlier in this talk, all relate to the importance of the\nactivist perspective. \n\n \n\nSecond, the design of public services depends, in any country,\non what the powerful groups of that society see as important and\nimperative.\n\n\nFor example, generally infectious diseases tend to receive much more\nattention than other maladies - - such as undernourishment - - do.\n\n\nThe battle against infectious diseases has been a success story\nin the world - - eliminating small-pox, vastly reducing malaria, cutting\ndown cholera, and so on ( and presumably once the medical riddles are solved,\nthe same will happen to AIDS as well ) .\n\n\nEven the poor get a lot of attention and support when they have\ninfectious diseases - - partly for good humanitarian reasons but also because\nthe possibility of the diseases spreading to others wor<l.ries the more\nprivileged members of the society. \n\n \n\n \" I sometimes wonder whether there is any way of making\npoverty terribly infectious.\n\n\nIf the privileged could catch poverty from the poor they meet in\nthe street.\n\n\nI don't doubt at all that poverty would be eliminated with\nremarkable speed.\" \n\n\nThis, alas, won't hap-pen, but the cost of poverty can spread to\nothers both through political agitation and through informed social\nanalysis and understanding.\n\n\nEven violent events can sometimes help to make a society face\nproblems that it would not have otherwise taken up.\n\n\nA good example is the impact of the recent violence in Los Angeles in\nbringing the problems of the inner cities in the USA into stronger\npolitical focus. \n\n \n\nIn thinking coolly and rationally about the costs and benefits of\ntargeting, we must not lose sight of the fundamental relevance of social\ndivisiveness and the power of the immunity of the more privileged sections\nof the society from the problems of the social underdogs.\n\n\nThe imperatives on the design of targeting cannot but reflect the\nreality of political divisions and the comparative vulnerabilities of the\ndifferent groups.\n\n\nThe political economy of targeting involves the divisive politics as\nwell as the rationalist economics of alternative public policies.\n\n\nBoth aspects demand attention.  <*> line above editorial comment\nin the

{"text": "Campus Debate     \n\n \n\nThe three most striking developments in American higher education\nin the past 30 years have been the transformation of the campus from a white\nmale preserve to one of racial and gender diversity; establishment of\nspecialized departments for the study of ethnic, gender, and international\nissues; and a phenomenal increase in the number of foreign students,\nparticularly from the developing world.\n\n\nWe in India who have been watching the American higher education\nscene, have considered these changes positive and enriching - - until Dinesh\n  \" Illiberal Education \"  came\nalong. \n\n \n\nThe complete title of the book,  \" Illiberal\nEducation: \" The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus  \n*, succinctly describes the thrust of the book and spells out  major concerns about the current state of American higher\neducation.\n\n\nThe American campus once provided an intellectual and harmonious\nenvironment conducive to the free flow of ideas; it gave impetus to\ncreativity and individual growth.\n\n\nBut today, laments D'Souza, it has been politicized over issues of\nrace and gender to such an extent that it is capable of providing only\nilliberal education in an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility. \n\n \n\nD'Souza sees academic freedom being stifled, and group interests\nbeing given precedence over individual rights and meritoracy.\n\n\nHe attributes this slide to selfish, shortsighted, and mindless\naffirmative action policies of university administrations, abetted by\ntheir  \" politically correct\"  supporters.\n\n\nD'Souza observes that those who call themselves  \" politically\ncorrect,\"  though in a minority, have succeeded in unleashing a\ntyranny that is eating up the very vitals of American higher education.\n\n\nThey stand for multiculturalism, feminism, and diversity in the\ncurriculum. \n\n \n\nD'Souza uses the case study approach, citing concrete examples\nfor illustrating his arguments.\n\n\nHe lays bare the inner workings and the resultant injustice of\nrace-based admissions at the University of California, Berkeley; explains the\ndynamics of black protest at Howard University in Washington, D.C., exposing\nits hollowness and superficiality; and examines the University of  efforts to protect minorities by imposing <*> line </*>\n restrictions on this liberal campus  speech, expression, and behavior. \n\n \n\nAgainst the background of these disturbing trends, D'Souza\ndiscusses how minority and politically correct activists have diluted the\nobjectivity, scholarly content, and rigor of the curriculum at Stanford\nUniversity in Stanford, California, and Duke University in Durham, North\nCarolina.\n\n\nHe says that at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the\n academic freedom has been compromised by an aggressive and\ncommitted ethnic and feminist minority that has charged the faculty with\nbeing insensitive, if not bigoted, on race and gender issues.\n\n\nFaced with such charges, and with no support from the weak and\napathetic university administration, the faculty has dropped controversial\ncourses and submitted itself to censorship, with knowledge and freedom as\nthe casualties. \n\n \n\nD'Souza has selected the six universities mentioned above for\nspecial consideration because they are in the  \" vanguard of the\nrevolution of minority victims\"  and as such are role models for\nothers.\n\n\nHe also alludes to other campuses to show that the experiences\ndescribed are universal.\n\n\nWhile giving an insight into the  \" politics of race and sex\"\n and a ringside view of university administrations' decision-making\nprocesses, D'Souza makes several significant comments about American academic\nin the broader perspective of the American democratic process. \n\n \n\nHe recognizes that American higher education has a responsibility\nto bring into the academic mainstream minority races and women who have\nhistorically been deprived of higher education.\n\n\nHe firmly believes that higher education in multi-racial America\nshould not be the preserve of the white male.\n\n\nThus, D'Souza is not arguing against affirmative action  per\nse  but rather against the ways in which it has been implemented.\n\n\nHe calls for an affirmative action policy that is in keeping with  commitment to individual rights and freedoms, one that would\navoid polarizing the campus into warring groups.\n\n\nD'Souza urges that the pace, nature and execution of reforms be\nworked out meticulously and sagaciously, so that they would not invite a\nbacklash from favorably disposed but status quo oriented whites. \n\n \n\nD'Souza offers some rather sketchy, tentative, and  \"\nmodest\"  proposals at the end of the book.\n\n\nHis first recommendation is   that universities continue with their  \" policies of preferential\ntreatment but alter their criteria of application from race to socioeconomic\ndisadvantage.\" \n\n\nHe is obviously trying to improve upon \nexperiment, which has endeavored to diversify the student body according to\nthe proportions in which racial groups are represented in  population.\n\n\nThis has created a situation in which many Asians and whites with\nsuperior test and academic records cannot find places while blacks and\nHispanics with average records can.\n\n\nD'Souza would like to avoid such  \" social engineering\"\n that totally ignores equity, achievement and excellence.\n\n\nUnder his proposals, admission officers will consider  \"\nthe  family back-ground, financial condition, and primary\nand secondary school environment.\" \n\n\nIf this record suggests that the  undistinguished\nperformance was not due to  \" lack of ability or application but\nrather to demonstrated disadvantage,\"  the applicant would be\nadmitted. \n\n \n\nThis solution does pose some practical problems regarding the\navailability and verification of data.\n\n\nWhile admissions based on race are mechanically given and candidates\nare treated as members of a group, admissions based on socioeconomic criteria\nwould be made on individual basis only after careful evaluation of each  learning and growth potential.\n\n\nProcessing individual cases would prove cumbersome and time\nconsuming.\n\n\nD'souza contends, however, that information required for making\nadmission decisions is available in university admissions and financial aid\noffices. \n\n \n\nBy replacing race with socioeconomic criteria, preferential\ntreatment for admission would be extended to a larger pool of applicants,\nthus reducing opportunities for blacks and Hispanics.\n\n\nAnticipating criticism, D'Souza is quick to counter by pointing out\nthat if being a member of a race can be  \" shown to translate into\nsocioeconomic disadvantage currently suffered by the student applicant\"\n he would continue to benefit under the scheme.\n\n\nThe number of racial minorities admitted to schools will not\ndiminish, only they will be getting into universities they academically\ndeserve. \n\n \n\n second recommendation aims at arresting the\ngrowth of separatism among minority students on the campus.\n\n\nThe author offers various explanations for a \ncoolness toward integration.\n\n\nHe says an admission process that gives preferential treatment\nto ethnic minorities ironically does not benefit them because they are so\ninadequately prepared academically that it is difficult for them to compete\nwith highly motivated and meritorious students at prestigious\nuniversities.\n\n\nThe minority dropout rate at Berkeley is high; fewer than 40 percent\nof entering blacks and 50 percent of entering Hispanics graduate.\n\n\nThe blacks and Hispanics, lured to the campus with offers of\nscholarships and other financial incentives, are told that because of their\nbackgrounds and viewpoints they are helping to produce a  \" dynamic\nintellectual environment\"  and  \" richer undergraduate\nexperience.\" \n\n\nConsequently, their poor performance comes as a rude shock and a\nblow to their self-esteem.\n\n\nIn their despondency, the blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians\nsupported by foreign students, feminists, and homo-sexuals blame the  racist structure and  \" white curriculum\" \nfor their poor performance. \n\n \n\nIn this gloomy situation, minorities find solace within their own\nethnic groupings such as the Rainbow Coalition at Stanford.\n\n\nThe minorities  \" tend to develop group consciousness and\ncollective orientation partly as a protective strategy.\" \n\n\nSome black organizations encourage  \" anti-intellectualism\"\n instead of starting remedial programs.\n\n\nMinorities are told learning is  \" acting white.\" \n\n\nIt would seem that Martin Luther King,  movement for\nequal rights and integration is being effectively challenged by Malcolm  ideology of separation and Black Power.\n\n\nIt is a  \" fight between Martin and Malcolm.\" \n\n\nHistorian Arthur Schlesinger aptly remarks,  \" The meltings\npot has yielded to the Tower of Babel.\"  \n\n \n\nThe university policy of establishing separate dormitories,\ncultural houses, and organizations for ethnic minorities also unwittingly\nencourages separatism.\n\n\nThe extreme case is that of California State University at\nSacramento, which is planning an entirely separate  \" college within a\ncollege\"  for blacks.\n\n\nWhites, meanwhile are becoming bitter about race-based admissions,\nfaculty hiring practices, behavior codes, and sensitivity  training that they perceive as being selectively used against\nthem.\n\n\nThey charge that double standards are being applied in the way\nuniversity leaderships cultivate minority organizations and in the care and\ntenderness with which they handle the campus protests of minorities. \n\n \n\nHaving discussed the crucial issue of multiculturalism throughout\nthe book,  proposed solution is indeed disproportionately\nbrief and inadequate.\n\n\nAs he has proposed in the case of race-based admissions, D'Souza\nwants the university to refuse to recognize and fund any group that is\n \" racially separatist and excludes students based on skin color.\"\n\n\n\nHe wants ethnicity and gender to cease to be criteria; he would\nreplace them with intellectual or cultural interests.\n\n\nD'Souza rightly points out that  \" thought and expression are\nthe currency in which universities trade and speculate\"  and that\nuniversities therefore have no business in supporting nonacademic\npolitically popular causes. \n\n \n\nThe third proposal is made in connection with courses classified\nunder the broad rubric of non-Western, ethnic, and gender studies.\n\n\nWhen more than 20 years ago such studies were introduced in American\nuniversities, they fulfilled an important need for covering intellectual and\ngeographical areas of study that had been largely neglected.\n\n\nEurocentric views had long dominated liberal arts education.\n\n\nThe new courses opened the window on the history of minority groups\nand non-Western cultures.\n\n\nThis perspective was reinforced with visiting faculty and students\nfrom foreign countries, and new opportunities wre created for Americans to\nstudy, teach, and perform research abroad.\n\n\nAs a visiting faculty member teaching Indian civilization at a\nMidwestern liberal arts college in the early 1970s, I personally experienced\nthe success of this internationalization.\n\n\nI still vividly recall curious and eager American youth learning\nabout faraway Indian and the masterful term paper one of them wrote on\nEmperor Akbar at the end of the semester. \n\n \n\nHowever, more recently,  academia has been\npolarized between the politically correct scholars, who have made issues of\nrace, gender, and class central to their teaching and research, and the\ntraditionalists who advocate the study of Western civilization and culture.\n\n\nThe latter claim to have an  \" objective\"  approach to\nscholarship and believe that it is important for Americans to study first the\ncivilization to which they belong before venturing to comprehend more exotic\ncultures.\n\n\nIn their view, politically correct scholars allow their radical\npolitical agenda to taint their scholarship and teaching.\n\n\nIn support of this contention they cite the example of the\npolitically correct describing Western culture as  \" racist, sexist,\nand oppressive,\"  ignoring its many nobler aspects.\n\n\nResearch in non-Western areas is done selectively from the Western\nperspective, the true culture eluding the researcher.\n\n\nThe teaching of non-Western courses leaves much to be desired and\nstudents take them because they are trendy, thin in substance, and hence easy\nto pass.\n\n\nWestern culture courses, on the other hand, argue the\ntraditionalists, are rich in content and <O> photograph of Book \"\nILLIBERAL EDUCATION \" etc., corner of column <&> therefore hard to\nmaster. \n\n \n\nD'Souza, who sides with the traditionalists, is particularly\nharsh on AfroAmerican and  studies programs, which he\nthinks are committed to an activist ideology of the 1960s, closed to academic\nargument, and  \" hostile to alternative views.\" \n\n\nHe finds these programs more political than scholarly and agrees with\nsociologist Walter Allen that the  \" departments play an affirmative\naction role\"  by providing opportunities to hire minority faculty.\n\n\nNot academically serious, they are  \" tolerated but never\nfully accepted by traditional or mainstream fields.\" \n\n\nD'Souza calls Harvard  studies professor Alice  class  \" so esoteric and yet so vulgar, so freewheeling\nand yet so dogmatic, so full of political energy and yet ultimately so\nfutile.\"  \n\n \n\nConsidering that there are some 350 Afro-American and 500  studies programs in American universities, \nblanket condemnation appears too sweeping.\n\n\nWestern civilization and culture, and non-Western, ethnic, and\ngender programs, complement each other.\n\n\nTogether they should really form the core of liberal arts education.\n\n\nRealizing this D'Souza suggests universities devise  \" a\nrequired course or sequence for entering freshmen which exposes them to the\nbasic issue of equality and human difference, through a carefully chosen set\nof classic texts that deal powerfully with those issues.\" \n\n\nThis is not a novel concept and has been tried before.\n\n\nA required course or sequence for entering freshmen will only be a\ntoken effort given the significance of the subject matter involved and the\nrichness of materials available for teaching and research. \n\n \n\nThe book and the  recommendations gain\nsignifilcance given the  background.\n\n\nAn Indian expatriate, D'Souza, 31, studied at prestigious Dartmouth\nCollege in New Hampshire, wrote for conservative journals like  National\nReview  , authored with Gregory Fossdal the biography of\ntele-vision evangelist Jerry Falwell, worked for the Reagan White House,\nand is now a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\nWith such impeccable conservative credentials, one would expect his\nwork to be polemical.\n\n\nSurprisingly, this representative of the pugnacious right is\nbalanced, understanding, and even somewhat sympathetic.\n\n\nPerhaps his Indian background has something to do with this\nrestraint.\n\n\nAs a Roman Catholic, D'Souza belonged to a religious minority in\nIndia and well knew what it was like living in a multicultural society that\nfaces some of the same problems as those in America.\n\n\nIndia is struggling to reflect its multiculturalism in its own\ncurricula, to bring its scheduled caste and tribes into the academic\nmainstream, and to effect a compromise between its  \" politically\ncorrect\"  left and traditionalists of the right.\n\n\nThis lucid, analytical, and bold book will therefore be of interest\nto Indians, particularly those in academia.

intersection.\n\n\nThe lights in the area are generally switched on well after 8 am\nthe chaos can be well imagined since the area has a high rate of vehicular\ntraffic due to presence of a school in the vicinity. \n\n \n\nA few weeks back the area around the traffic lights was dug up to\nlay some MTNL cables and the lights were uprooted.\n\n\nDespite the fact that the uprooted lights stayed unattended for\nalmost four days no effort was made by the traffic police to substitute the\ntraffic lights by a    policeman   who\ncould ensure that the vehicles at the crossing    move\n  smoothly. \n\n \n\nEven after the dug up area was filled and the traffic lights\nreinstalled they have yet to start functioning.\n\n\nYesterday morning speeding buses on the main Shankar Road made it\nextremely difficult for the traffic from inside the colony to come on to the\nmain road.\n\n\nThe chaos takes dangerous dimensions since in the morning a large\nnumber of TSRs and other vehicles carrying school going children are forced\nto zig zag their way through the speeding buses.\n\n\nThe surprising part is that a mere 100 metres away at the Ridge road\nShankar road round-about as many as four policemen are stationed\ncompletely ignoring the chaos that is developing at a stone throwing\ndistance. \n\n \n\nAlthough traffic police claims that the  \n  nonfunctioning    lights are put to order within minutes\nof their going wrong, the lights in this crossing seems to have been\ntotally overlooked.\n\n\nThe traffic police must realise that with the presence of school in\nthe colony the volume of traffic that tries to enter the colony or leave it\nis substantial and the lights and the traffic at the intersection must be\nregularised to ensure that no traffic mishaps occur. \n\n \n\nWould the DCP traffic Maxwell Pereira please do the needful and\nensure that chaos does not reign supreme at the intersection and, even if the\nlights start functioning, station traffic policemen

truth, divinity, fortitude, and\nso on, she saw contradictions to the Golden Age. \n\n \n\n ` Why?'  she wanted to know. \n\n \n\nI told her how for days I lay entangled in the reeds, wailing for\nmy mother.\n\n\nI fed on the watery breast of the Kasuki river and made friends with\nthe fish and birds.\n\n\nThey told me stories about the beautiful seven babies who fed on the\never-flowing breasts of the Daughter.\n\n\nI knew they were my lucky brothers.\n\n\nI envied them and longed to join them.\n\n\nOne day Indra sent an   apsara   , to disrupt\nthe  samadhi  of a  rishi  .\n\n\nThe King of Gods was nervous because the  rishi  was\nbecoming much too powerful through his asceticism.\n\n\nBathing one morning in the Kasuki, the   apsara \n saw me lying in the reeds.\n\n\nTaking me for an abandoned baby, she picked me up and took me with\nher to Amaravati,  golden city.\n\n\nShe was the only mother I knew.\n\n\nI nursed at her breast and played in her lap.\n\n\nWhen I grew a little older, she took me to court with her.\n\n\nNo one questioned my abrupt appearance, because in those days babies\ncould be made by a simple conception in the mind.\n\n\nI learned the workings of the court and also those of    mind.\n\n\nHe was my hero. \n\n \n\nIn  Vaikuntha  , my brothers, the seven Angiras,\nlearned the secrets of divinity from  Agni  and the \ngurus  , while I learned to cultivate an ego and how to overpower\nenemies.\n\n\nThey were taught to be future mediators between men and gods, whereas\nI studied the art of spying and hypocrisy.\n\n\nTo Indra anyone who wasn't weak was a prospective enemy.\n\n\nHe connived with and manipulated the gods to assist him in destroying\nthose engaged in acquiring power through war or asceticism. \n\n \n\nThe  gurus  and the gods never knew me.\n\n\nThe  Vedas  never mentioned me.\n\n\nEven my mother didn't know who I was.\n\n\nI was just another immortal nobody, created by an egotistical god or\n rishi  .\n\n\nOnly I knew my identity.\n\n\nI don't know why I kept silent about this.\n\n\nPerhaps I feared no one one would believe me if I told them, or,\nmaybe, I didn't want to be a divine Angiras, a spiritual celestial, who would\nnever know the excitment of baser emotions.\n\n\nShri is the only person I told, because from the first instant I saw\nher, I felt an  emotion that was by no means\nspiritual or heavenly, but of the earth. \n\n\nI look at Shrivatsa.\n\n\nShe is pulling out the last grey hair.\n\n \n\n ` Shri,'  I say, going to her and slipping my\narms around her waist.\n\n\n ` Do you remember when   \nlovemaking made the Earth tremble on her tortoise?' \n\n\nI reach up to fondle her breasts. \n\n \n\n ` Hm,'  she says, covering my hands with her own.\n\n\n ` What a couple.'  \n\n \n\n `  not too bad ourselves.\n\n\nWe can at least make the bed tremble.'  \n\n \n\nShe gives a little laugh and turns around to face me.\n\n\nPlacing a kiss softly on my lips, she says,  ` Come, or  be late for the party.'  \n\n \n\n ` To hell with the party.\n\n\n go to bed.'  I let my lips linger on the\ncurve of her gentle breasts. \n\n \n\nSlapping me lightly on the back of my neck, she says,  `\n be late for the party.'  \n\n \n\nI groan into her breasts. \n\n \n\n ` Stop,'  she says.\n\n\n ` Besides, I want to save myself for another man tonight.'\n \n\n \n\nMy head jerks up.\n\n\n ` Who?'  I ask. \n\n \n\n ` You don't know him.\n\n\n she hesitates. \n\n \n\nDisengaging herself from my arms, she continues,  `  been seeing him for a while.'  \n\n \n\n ` Shrivatsa, you can't do this.\n\n\nWhy didn't you tell me?'  \n\n \n\nShe laughs and says,  ` Aren't we jealous tonight,'\n and runs into the bathroom.\n\n\nIn a few minutes I hear the shower running. \n\n \n\nI sit down on the edge of the bed, wondering at myself.\n\n\nI hadn't realized that the years had bred so much jealousy in me.\n\n\nI used to be able to accept  liaisons as an\nirrefutable law of nature.\n\n\nIn fact, I even encouraged her.\n\n\nSo how could I explain the sudden contraction of my heart when she\nmentioned this other man ?\n\n\nThis was surely the nadir of time when even first-born immortals\nlike me were rebelling against preordained laws. \n\n \n\nShrivatsa pads out of the bathroom.\n\n\nHer bare, golden body  gleams with drops of\nmoisture as she stands in the middle of the room, freeing her long, black\nhair from the shower cap. \n\n \n\n ` Shri,'  I say,  `  been\nthinking.\n\n\nI want you to go back into  purdah  .'  \n\n \n\n ` What?'  she asks.\n\n\nI smile, for it isn't often now that I can surprise her. \n\n \n\n ` You know, wear a veil, like you used to in the Mughal\nera, back in the sixteenth century.'  \n\n \n\n ` What?'  she says again.\n\n\n ` I guess I just don't want anyone to see you any more .'\n \n\n \n\n ` Angiras,'  she says,  ` shut up'.\n \n\n \n\n ` Why?\n\n\n nothing wrong in not wanting to share your wife\nwith other men.\n\n\nThis age is too permissive for me'.  \n\n \n\n `  not just a wife.\n\n\nBesides, haven't you heard that women today have a liberation\nmovement?'  \n\n \n\n ` Sure.\n\n\n been hearing of  lib since the time of\nKali.'  \n\n \n\n `  damn right.\n\n\nWomen were goddesses in their own right in those days.\n\n\nThey weren't just wives of gods.' \n\n\nShe runs her fingers through her hair, untangling the snarls.\n\n\n ` Could you pass me the comb?'  she says.\n\n\nI get up and walk to the dresser, eyeing her from the corner of my\neyes. \n\n \n\n ` Angiras,'  she says, extending her hand for\nthe comb.\n\n\n the matter ?\n\n\nDon't you trust me any more?'  \n\n \n\nI hand her the comb without answering.\n\n\nInstead I ask her,  ` Why did you say what you did?' \n\n\n \n\n ` About the other man?'  she asks, teasing the\ntips of her hair with the comb I gave her. \n\n \n\nI nod. \n\n  playing with contradictions again, Angiras.\n\n\nRemember who I am?'  \n\n \n\n ` Can't you forget that even for a minute?' \n\n\n \n\n ` How can I?\n\n\n in my nature.\n\n\nI was made that way.\n\n\nA wanton woman,'  she says, stressing each syllable.\n\n\n me.' \n\n\nShe arranges her black curtain of hair over her breasts, and\nthrowing her shoulders back, looks at me from under her lashes.\n\n\n ` Wanton woman,'  she whispers playfully. \n\n \n\nSilently I curse the Grandfather again for making other people\n do his dirty work.\n\n\nOut of the duplicity of their minds, the gods made him create a\nwanton woman to keep human beings from aspiring to be gods.\n\n\nThank god, they hadn't taken human love into account. \n\n \n\n ` But you do love me, don't you, Shri?' \n\n\nI say, going to her and brushing away hair from her breasts. \n\n \n\n ` Hm,'  she says.\n\n\n ` I just like other men, too.\n\n\nOne in particular.'  \n\n \n\n ` Have you already got tired of me?' \n\n\nI put my arms around her. \n\n \n\n ` No,'  she says, pushing at my chest to free\nherself.\n\n\n ` After all,  only been four-hundred-and-twenty\nmillion years.'  \n\n \n\n ` That long,'  I say, ignoring the sarcasm.\n\n\n ` It seems I only met you yesterday in Amaravati.' \n\n\n \n\n ` No, not Amaravati.\n\n\nRemember,  never been to that city.\n\n\nBy the time I was created, the gates of Amaravati were opened to\nonly a chosen few.'  \n\n \n\n ` Of course, I remember now.'  I release her and\nwalk to the bed again.\n\n\n ` It was Urvashi I met again in Amaravati.'  \n\n \n\n ` You mean your mother?' \n\n\nThe edge is back in her voice. \n\n \n\n ` She didn't know I was the same boy when I met her\nhundreds of years later.'  \n\n \n\n ` The slut,'  she says, vigorously combing her\nhair. \n\n \n\n `  a beautiful woman.\n\n\nDid I tell you how I met her again?'  \n\n \n\n ` Many times.\n\n\nBut you can tell me again.\n\n\nI like to hear how the   apsaras   at  court were considered chaste and unspoiled even after they had\nscrewed hundreds of gods and  rishis  , not to mention their\nown sons.'  \n\n  `  telling you, there was no way of her knowing I was\nthe same boy.'  \n\n \n\n ` Bull.\n\n\nLet me tell you, dear Angiras.'  She points the comb at me\nas though it were a weapon.\n\n\n ` A woman knows the man nurtured on her milk even when she\nmeets him after the whole   kalpa   of the four aeons\nof Creation .'  \n\n \n\n ` How would you know?\n\n\n never had a baby?' \n\n\nI say and bite my tongue.\n\n\nI hate to remind Shrivatsa of that.\n\n\nMany, many years ago, when babies could no longer be created by the\npower of the mind, or  Agni's  fire, Shri told me she wanted a\nchild.\n\n\nI still remember her suicidal grief when I told her she couldn't.\n\n\n  barren.\n\n\nAnd  my fault, or rather  fault.\n\n\nOnce the gods and  rishis  went to Kailash to implore\nShiva to stop his violent lovemaking, because it made the Earth tremble on\nher tortoise.\n\n\nTheir intervention denied Parvati the embraces and seed of Shiva.\n\n\nSo she laid a curse on them that their wives would be forever\nbarren. \n\n \n\nHowever, I went there for a different purpose.\n\n\nI wanted to peep in on the divine pair and note down a few \n asans   , which years later could be included in the\n  Kama Sutra   . \n\n \n\nShri drops the comb on the floor, and runs a hand over her\nsupple, flat stomach.\n\n\n `  never know what it is to be a mother,'\n she says softly.\n\n\nThen her fingers trace the veins visible through the transparent\nskin of the inside of her forearm.\n\n\n ` My only baby will be my ant.\n\n\nI wonder where it is now?'  \n\n \n\nI take her naked form in my arms and rock her gently. \n\n \n\n `  be late for the party,'  she\nsays, suddenly breaking away from my arms.\n\n\n ` And I still have to get dressed.' \n\n\nShe rushes to the closet. \n\n \n\nI watch her bare bottom moving among the silk  saris\n , as she decides what to wear, envying her ability to snap back into\ntime so easily.\n\n\nOf late  been having trouble doing that.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "51f52669-9090-47e8-b3b9-13b586beb5b1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.169553+00:00"}
{"text": "Salt tolerance in Halophytes - -  \n\n \n\nHalophytes are the salt plants which can grow in salt rich soil\nand complete their life cycle is salinity. \n\n \n\nThe halophytes can grow in saline soil because they have some\nadaptations to grow in saline soil & these are as follows: \n\n\n1 Extrusion\n\n\n2 Accumulation of salts in special hairs\n\n\n3 Salt secretion\n\n\n4 Exclusion\n\n\n5 Dilution\n\n\n6 Retransport of salt in soil / root medium\n\n\n7 Removal of salt saturated organs\n\n\n8 Salt leaching\n\n\n  1 Extrusion  - - \n\n \n\nSome    plasma   having extrusion\npumps in the salt glands which can actively    remove\n  the salts as ions from the mesophyll cells\n\n\neg.   Rhizophora mucronata   \n\n \n\nThe extrusion pumps are generally located in the salt glands.\n\n\n\n 2 Accumulation of salts in special hairs. \n\n \n\nIn many halophytes salts are accumulated in various epidermal\noutgrowth there may be salt hairs of bladders.\n\n\nThe salt bladders having  neek or stalk cell and\nbladder cell.\n\n\nThe neck cell collects salts from mesophyll as epidermal cells and\ntransported into bladder cell.   \n\n\n 3  Salt Secretion  - - \n\n \n\nGenerally salt    secreted  \nthrough the glands which are located on the epidermis or in the grove. \n \n\n\neg.   Avicennia  ,  Lolium  ,  Tamarix \n\n\n \n\nThese salt    secreting   cells\n   secreted   salts outside which can be\nleached by rain drops. \n\n \n\nThe salts are also    secreted  \nthrough Gycathode by the process of guttation. \n\n\n 4  Exclusion  - - \n\n \n\nThis is very common phenomenon  in halophytes; the\nsalts asorbed  are  not transported to direct sites like leaf &\nexcluded for long times. \n\n\n 5  Dilution  - - \n\n \n\n   Some   halophytes absorb more\nwater & the salts get diluted at the same time the volume of plant also\nincreased. \n\n\n 6  Retransport of salt in soil medium  - - \n\n \n\nThere is no  way to remove salts, so the plants are\nhaving capacity to load the salts in phloem & transported to root where they get released. \n\n\n 7  Removal of salt saturated organs  - - \n\n \n\nThis is very common    occurrence  \nin very adaptive halophytes where salts are loaded in a    particular   organ & then this organ  is  removed\n ie leaves.\n\n\nIn salicornia along with leaves some amount of cortex is also removed\nwhich causes large amount of release of salts. \n\n\n 8  Salt leaching  - - \n\n \n\nSalts come in epidermal cells along with water evaporation &\nduring rain or water drops the salts are leached out from the epidermal\ncracks or non-continuous epiderms.    \n\n \n\n\n  Role of proline in drought resistance  - - \n\n \n\nProline is    an   amino acid\n( false amino acid because  of the  presence of imino group ie - NH - ) .\n\n\nDuring drought the proline content generally increases & in many\ninvestigated plants the proline accumulation   \noccurs.    \n\n \n\nThe accumulation proline is due to following \nreasons.  \n\n \n\nThese are the reasons of proline accumulation during drought.\n\n\nThe role of proline in drought resistance is very well known.\n\n\nThese are as follows :  \n\n \n\n 1 Recovery after stress - - \n\n\nAfter completion of stress & getting suitable conditions then it\nprovides some energy for recovery. \n\n\n 2  Osmoregulation  - - \n\n\n\n It is one of the most important role of proline:\n\n\nDue to proline the osmotic potential get deceased, consequently the\n    transferable    rate also\ndecreased, during drought. \n\n\n 3 Retention of bound water - - \n\n \n\nProline keep some amount  of  water along with it,\nhence can be useful at the time of drought.\n\n\neg 4 g proline can retain 10 ml water. \n\n\n 4 Source of energy and energy conservation - - \n\n \n\nThe energy which is given off during drought can be utilized for\nproline synthesis. \n\n\n 5 Sink for Nitrogen and carbon - - \n\n \n\nDuring drought the proline biosynthesis can act as nitrogen &\ncarbon sink which can  be  used in suitable conditions. \n\n\n 6  Protection of enzyme  - - \n\n \n\nSome enzymes can be protected during drought by proline. \n\n \n\nEven though proline  is  very useful in drought\nresistance, it is not universal phenomenon shown by plants.\n\n\nSucculents do not accumulate proline.\n\n\n96 species which    were   investigated for\nstudy accumulate proline.  \n\n \n\n\n  Effects of DV-radiations on plants  - - \n\n \n\nThe ultra-violet radiations are the electromagnetic radiations\nhaving small wavelength    as compared to   the\nvisible light radiations.\n\n\nIt induces many effects in plant, when    it is\n  exposed to uv-radiations.\n\n\nThe range of D.V. radiation is follows - - \n\n\n100-200 - For DV radiations\n\n\n200-300 - For DV radiations\n\n\n300-400 - Near DV radiations  \n\n \n\nAbove    diagram shows   some\neffective sites of DV radiation. \n\n \n\nThe enzyme activities get decreased eg RuBP case, PEP case. \n\n \n\nThe DV radiations promote the anthocyanine pigment formation eg.\n   the   plants growing on top of the hill produce\ndark coloured flowers as    compared   to\nplants which  are  present at the base of hill. \n\n \n\nIn some cases flowering promoted or in some cases flowering\ninhibited.\n\n\nGenerally during flowering it acts on phytochrome.  \n\n \n\nGenerally the rate of photosynthesis get decreased due to\ninhibition of photosynthetic enzymes. \n\n \n\nThe rate of respiration by DV - gets increased. \n\n \n\nOne more important effect by DV-radiation is mutation or\nchromosomal abnormality.\n\n\nDue to DV rays the formation thymin dimer or uracil dimer takes\nplace. \n\n \n\nThe rate of cell division get decreased by DV radiations. \n<*> seven blank lines</*> \n\n \n\n\n  Iron deficiency  and toxicity  - - \n\n \n\nGenerally iron is important nutrient for synthesis of\nchlorophyll.\n\n\nIt is one of the essential micronutrient but   \nrequires   in very    little   amount.\n\n\nGenerally the iron toxicity    occurs  \nin acidic soil.\n\n\nIron deficiency generally    occurs   in\nalkaline soil.\n\n\nThe iron deficiency  generally   \noccurs   because it forms various carbonates with soil    collides   & gets precipitated and these\nprecipitated forms are very less soluble or    not  \nsoluble in water.\n\n\nGenerally the acceptable & soluble form of iron is Fe3+ but\nis highly acidic soil it gets reduced & remains in the form of Fe2+\nwhich is stronger reducing agent & toxic to plant.\n\n\nSome species of iron present in soil  are \n\n\nFe(OH)+2, Fe(OH)++\n\n\n  Deficiency symptoms  - -  \n\n \n\n1 It is useful in chlorophyll synthesis so yellowing or chlorosis\nis one of the important    symptoms.   \n\n \n\n2 Stunting of the plant. \n\n \n\n3 Less nitrogen ( soluble ) content due to Fe deficiency. \n\n\n  Toxicity  - - \n\n \n\nIt is very toxic when present at 10 ppm level.\n\n\nDue to Fe toxicity some nutritional or ionic imbalance    occurs   because it    acts   as\ncompetative for  <-> no. </- >  a number   of ions like\nK+, Ca+ & so on. \n\n \n\nDue to Fe toxicity there is precipitation of phosphorus (\nphosphate ) & ultimatly causes phosphorus deficiency. \n\n \n\nSome necrotic patches can show due to high iron level in soil\nmedium, in severe    conditions  \nleaf-fall may    occur.    \n\n \n\n\n  Waterlogging  - - \n\n \n\nIt is one of the most serious    problems\n  among the agricultural practices.\n\n\nWaterlogging causes many hazardous effects    to\n  plants as well as soil property.   \n\n \n\nDuring water logging the air phase is   \ncompletely   removed by water and due to this the microflora of soil\ngets    completely   changed & due to oxygen\ndeficiency  ` anoxia'     occurs. \n \n\n\n *  Effect on soil properties  - - \n\n \n\nAnaerobic condition formed & no exchange of air    occurs   in waterlogged condition.\n\n\nIn normal soil there is exchange of air is 1000 times greater than\nwaterlogged soil. \n\n\n Alteration of soil temperature    :  \n\n\n \n\n   Because   of the water warm  as    compared   to soil and also\ncool  as    compared   to soil\nso the day temperature get decreased & night   \ntemperature   increased. \n\n\n *     Toxins    - - \n\n \n\nDuring waterlogging condition whatever amount of oxygen present\nin  the form of  dissolved condition is used by aerobic microorganisms\n& soil    completely   deficit for  O2 at that time aerobic microflora is removed and the place of\naerobic microflora taken by anaerobic microflora.\n\n\nThese anaerobic microorganisms    plus  \nused different forms line No3-, So4- - \nfor their final electron acceptance & gets changed into NH3.\n\n\nIn this way the accumulation of marsh gas ( methan ) , ammonia,\nethylene in toxic level takes place.\n\n\nSome times Fe3+ also act as final electron acceptor & gets\nchanged as Fe2+ which is toxic. \n\n\n *  Effects of waterlogging on plants  - - \n\n \n\nThe waterlogging causes negative effects on plant development,\ngrowth & metabolism also.\n\n\nSome of the important effects are as follows.  \n\n\n 1  Effect on nutriton  - - \n\n \n\nWhatever amount of oxygen present in dissolved    condition   is removed by microflora & root cells  which\n require oxygen for aerobic respiration, so the anaerobic respiration is\nfollowed by the plants.\n\n\nOnly glycolysis call takes place in anaerobic condition so on  sufficient amount of nutrients absorbed by plants because generally\nsalt uptake is active process. \n\n\n 2  Growth and development  - - \n\n \n\nGrowth & development greatly affected by waterlogging because it\ncauses yellowing of leaves which are the main source & the photosynthetic\nefficiency get reduced which is directly proportional to dry matter\nproduction. \n\n\n 3  Damage to roots  - - \n\n \n\nAs roots facing directly to waterlogging condition it damages\n   largely the   formation of aercuchyma in\nroot cells    occur   because of increasing\n cellulose activity.  \n\n\n 4  Ultrastructural changes  - - \n\n \n\nThe activity of chlorophyllase enzyme is stimulated by\nwaterlogging due to which the breakdown of chlorophyll takes place.\n\n\nSome toxic substances accumulated in the root top  \n capillary   cells due to which damage root system of plants.\n\n\n 5  Water deficiency  - - \n\n \n\nDue to waterlogging condition there is water deficiency    occurs   means literally the plant is in water but\nunable to take water because the water uptake is   \ncompletely   checked due to damaging root system & less energy\nformation for water uptake. \n\n\n 6  Effect on metabolism  - - \n\n \n\nDuring waterlogging the photosynthetic rate gets decreased\nbecause the stomata get closed.\n\n\nOne more reason for photosynthesis decreasing is the check of the\ntransport of photosynthates due to which  accumulate\nin leaf ultimately  and  the rate of photosynthes is inhibited. \n\n \n\nThe normal EMP pathway is changed & dominated by ppp. \n\n\n 7  Hormonal balance  \n\n \n\nThe hormonal changes occur during waterlogging. \n\n\n a  Auxin  - - G \n\n \n\nGenerally the level of auxin increased in shoot because no\ntransport of auxin  occurs  to roots.\n\n\neg sunflower seedling shows    markedly \n increased in auxin level during waterlogging.\n\n\nThe shoot tips are only the site of auxin synthesis & the transport\nof auxin is checked. \n\n\n b  Gibberellins  - - \n\n \n\nGenerally the level of gibberllins get decreased because the\nsite of gibberlins synthesis \" D \" root tips & during water\nlogging the root tips get damaged. \n\n\n c  Cytokinins  - - \n\n \n\nThe level of cytokinin also decreased during waterlogging. \n \n\n\n d  Ethylene  - - \n\n \n\nDuring water logging the marked increase in ethylene    occurs   this is because the auxin promotes the\nethylene biosynthesis.   \n\n \n\nThe    precursor   of \"\nethylene \" ie SAM and ACC are transported from roots to shoot for\nformation of ethylene because ethylene biosynthesis requries O2.\n\n\nIn rooting medium also ethylene content increase by the\nmicro-organisms. \n\n \n\nThe anaerobic respiration also causes formation of ethenol &\ntoxic intermediate.  \n\n \n\nDue to ethylene biosynthesis the many changes    occur   in plants, ie yellowing or  sevensences  of\nleaves.\n\n\nEthylene also causes decrease the other growth hormone levels like\ndecrease GF & cytokinine content. \n\n\n e  Abscisic acid  ( ABA ) \n\n \n\nThe Abscisic acid level also increases during water logging.\n\n\nThe ABA is stronger agent of stomata closing phenomenon.\n\n\nDue to closing of stomata the rate of phytosynthesis checked and\nultimatly all the activities of plants get checked.    \n\n \n\n*8 Formation of adventitions root.\n\n\nIt is adaptation for water logging.\n\n\nIn sunflower the adventition rooting takes place during water\nlogging.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d3e07990-35eb-4cf9-944a-5a7bc44b46c0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.170905+00:00"}

{"text": "COMBINING ABILITY FOR PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERS  AND OPIUM YIELD IN OPIUM POPPY ( PAPAVER  SOMNIFERUM L. )\n      \n\n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThe combining ability analysis was worked out in F1 and\nF2 generations of 8 x 8 parents half diallel for physiological\ncharacters and opium yield in opium poppy.\n\n\nResults revealed that both additive and nonadditive genetic components\nof variance governed the expression of opium yield and physiological\ncharacters studied, former being predominant in both the generations.\n\n\nAmong the varieties, MOP 539 for opium yield, harvest index, days to\n50 % flowering, leaf area and leaf area index and MOP 507 for opium yield,\nbiological yield, NBPGR 1 for opium yield and early flowering and NOP 4 for\nharvest index appeared to be good general combiners.\n\n\nThey can be used as donors in future breeding for high opium yield\nwith efficient harvest index.\n\n\nIn respect of specific combining ability, crosses MOP 539 x NOP 4,\nNBPGR 1 x NBRI 3, and NOP 4 x UO 185 showed best cross combininations for\nopium yield with harvest index.  \n\n \n\nKey words : \" Opium poppy \" , \" combining\nability \" . \n\n \n\nImprovement of plant type is basically a function of genetic\nmanipulation to improve harvest index.\n\n\nThe importance of favorable harvest index in terms of partitioning of\nphotosynthate to the economically useful part of the plant has been well\nrecognised.\n\n\nIn improvement of plant type, harvest index appears to be more\nreliable selection criterion for high yield.\n\n\nNo work on combining ability for harvest index in opium poppy by\ntaking opium yield as a economic product, has yet been undertaken.\n\n\nTherefore, attempt has been made for identifying varieties with\nrespect to their combining ability characteristics for physiological\ncharacters and opium yield in F1 and F2 generations of\nopium poppy to orient the breeding programme for developing efficient plant\ntypes for high yielding varieties or hybrids.  \n\n\n\n MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\nThe material comprised eight promising diverse genotypes\ndeveloped in all India Co-ordinated Research Project on Medicinal and\nAromatic Plants at different centres ( MOP 539, MOP 507 and MOP 278 from\nMadhya Pradesh, IC 128 from National Germplasm, NBPGR 1 from National Bureau\nof Plant Genetic Resources, New Delhi, NBRI 3 and NOP 4 from Uttar Pradesh,\nand UO 185 from Rajasthan ) .\n\n\nThe F1 and F2 progenies of 8 x 8 diallel set\nexcluding reciprocals along with parents were raised in randomised block\ndesign with two replications during rabi 1989.\n\n\nPlants in two-row plots of the parents and F  1s and\nfour-row plots of F  2s were spaced at 30 cm between rows and 8-10\ncm within rows.\n\n\nThe observations were recorded on five random plants in parents and F\n 1s and 40 plants in F  2s for physiological traits ( leaf\narea, leaf area index, biological yield and harvest index ) and for number of\neffective lancing / plant, days to 50 % flowering and opium yield.\n\n\nHarvest index was calculated as the ratio of opium yield to\nbiological yield.\n\n\nThe combining ability analysis was done according to Griffing Method\n2 and Model 1 [ 1 ] .  \n\n\n RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nThe analysis of variance for combining ability ( Table 1 )\nrevealed that general combining ability ( gca ) were significant for all the\ncharacters in both the generations except leaf area index in F1\ngneration, indicating the presence of additive gene effects for all the\ncharacters studied in the present material.\n\n\nSpecific combining ability ( sca ) effects were highly significant\nfor all the characters in F1 generation except number of effective\nlancing / plant, whereas it was significant only for days to 50 % flowering,\nharvest index , and opium yield    in F2 generations.\n\n\nSignificant sca variance indicated the importance of nonadditive gene\neffects in F1 generation for all the characters, except for\neffective lancing / plant and in both the generations for days to 50 %\nflowering, harvest index and opium yield.\n\n\nThe data also revealed that gca estimates were relatively higher than\nsca for days to 50 % flowering, effective lancing / plant and harvest index\nin both generations, and for other characters in F2 generation,\nwhich suggested predominance of additive gene action controlling all the\ncharacters.\n\n\nFurther, it was observed that variance due to gca increased in\nF2 generation, whereas sca variance decreased considerably for all\nthe characters studied, indicating that the genetic variability in the\npresent material may be associated with general combining ability variance in\nboth the generations.\n\n\nAdditive gene action for different characters was also reported\nearlier [ 2, 3 ] in opium poppy and for harvest index in sorghum [ 4 ] . \n\n \n\nIn the present study, the magnitude of additive variance for all\nthe characters were relatively high and thus it suggest that per se\nperformance of the parent may be a good indication of their general combining\nability, although it is not always so.\n\n\nSignificant gca effects revealed that MOP 539 in both the\ngenerations, IC 128 in F1 and MOP 507, MOP 278 in F2\ngeneration were identified as good general combiners for early flowering (\nTable 2 ) .\n\n\nMOP 539 was identified as good general combiner for leaf area and\nleaf area index in F2 generation.\n\n\nIC 128 in F1 generation showed good general combiner for\nleaf area index and biological yield.\n\n\nMOP 507 recorded to be good general combiner for biological yield in\nboth generations.\n\n\nUO 185 and MOP 507 showed good general combiners for number of\neffective lancing / plant in F1 and F2 generations,\nrespectively.\n\n\nIn respect of harvest index, MOP 539    and NOP 4 showed good general combiners over\nboth the generations.\n\n\nMOP 278 also recorded good general combiner for harvest index in\nF1 generation.\n\n\nMOP 507 and NBPGR 1 in F1 generation and MOP 539 in\nF2 generation were identified as good general combiners for opium\nyield.\n\n\nIn few parents like MOP 539 for opium yield, harvest index, leaf area\nindex, leaf area and days to 50 % flowering, MOP 507 for opium yield,\nbiological yield and days to 50 % flowering, high performance was associated\nwith favourable gca effects for number of characters.\n\n\nBut rest of the parents did not show such relationship, thus\nselection of the parents for their good general combining ability cannot be\nbased on their performance alone.\n\n\nBoth gca and per se performance criteria should be considered while\nselecting the parent for future breeding.\n\n\nMOP 539 and MOP 507 were good general combiners for opium yield and\nother physiological characters, which means that these parents transmitted\nadditive genes for yield and components characters in their progeny.\n\n\nInconsistent results of gca effects over generations could possibly\nbe attributed to genotype x environment interaction effects and also due to\nthe role of nonadditive gene effects.\n\n\nThe intermating population involving parents showing good general\ncombiners for these traits and simultaneously subjected to mass or biparental\nmating in early generation will offer maximum promise in breeding for high\nyield through building efficient plant type. \n\n \n\nSpecific combining ability effects ( sca ) presented in Table 3\nrevealed that out of 28 crosses only eight crosses in F1 generation\nand seven crosses in F2 were significant for sca effects for high\nopium yield.\n\n\nAmong these, the crosses MOP 539 x NOP 4, NBPGR 1 x NBRI 3, and NOP 4\nx UO 185 showed consistant sca performance in both generations, which could\n    be considered as good specific cross combinations for opium\nyield.\n\n\nThe inconsistency in sca effects observed over generations is\nattributed to dominance x dominance interaction and genotypes x environment\ninteraction.\n\n\nIn respect of harvest index, six crosses in each generation recorded\nsignificant sca effects in desirable direction.\n\n\nHowever, only the crosses MOP 539 x NOP 4 and NBPGR 1 x NBRI 3\nexhibited consistant desirable significant sca effect, indicating good\nspecific cross combinations for harvest index.\n\n\nThe crosses IC 128 x UO 185 for early flowering and NBPGR 1 x NBRI 3\nfor leaf area showed desirable specific combiners in both the generations.\n\n\nThe crosses MOP 539 x IC 128, MOP 539 x NBPGR 1, MOP 507 x UO 185,\nMOP 278 x NOP 4, MOP 278 x UO 185, IC 128 x NBPGR 1, NBPGR 1 x NBRI 3 for\nleaf area, MOP 507 x UO 185, MOP 278 x NOP 4, IC 128 x NBRI 3 and IC 128 x\nNOP 4 for biological yield were identified good specific cross combinations.\n\n\nThe crosses MOP 539 x NOP 4 and NBPGR 1 x NBRI 3 were identified as\ngood specific combinations for both opium yield and harvest index.\n\n\nThe parents and crosses showing favourable gca and sca effects for\nopium yield also showed significant favourable gca and sca effects,\nrespectively, for physiological and other component characters in one or

{"text": "Ligand mediated pseudohypersensitivity of some 4f-4f\ntransitions (  3H4 <*> arrow</*>  3P2,\n 3P1,  3P0 and  1D2 )\nand coordination environment around praseodymium ( III )   \n\n\nSudhindra N Misra & Surendra B Mehta  Chemical\nLaboratories, Bhavanagar University, Bhavnagar 364002 \n\n\nReceived 22 August 1991; revised received 17 December 1991   \n\n\n  1 Introduction  \n\n \n\nThe complexation of lanthanides brings enhancement of the\nintensity of hypersensitive transition up to 200 times greater than that of\ncorresponding lanthanide aquo ion1; however, the intensities of\nother transitions have rarely been found to be larger than those of aquo ion\nand sometimes even less2.3.\n\n\nDuring the course of our work on several complexes of structurally\ndifferent ligands, we have observed that the binding characteristics of\ndifferent ligands apprehensive transitions of lanthanides.\n\n\nThe transitions  3H4 <*> arrow</*> \n3P2;  3H4 <*> arrow</*> \n3P1;  3H4 <*> arrow</*> \n1D0 in Pr ( III ) and  4I9/2 <*> arrow</*>\n 4G7/2;  4I9/2 <*> arrow</*> \n4F7/2;  4I9/2 <*> arrow</*> \n4F5/2 and  4I9/2 <*> arrow</*> \n4F3/2 in Nd ( III ) are such that they do not follow selection\nrules for quadrupole transition; yet these showed substantial sensitivity\ntowards even the minor changes in the immediate coordination environment\naround corresponding lanthanide ion.\n\n\nWe have given the name ligand mediated pseudohypersensitivty\nfor such observation and considered these transitions as\npseudohypersensitive transitions4.5a.\n\n\nThe present work reports the ligand mediated\npseudohypersensitivity of  3H4 <*> arrow</*> \n3P2;  3H4 <*> arrow</*> \n3P1 and  2H4 <*> arrow</*> \n1D2 transitions of Pr ( III ) and utilized the magnitude and\nvariation of the oscillator strength ( P ) and Jodd Ofelt electric dipole\nintensity ( T<*>lambda</*> ) parameters in complexes of Pr ( III ) (\nhaloacetates, fluorocarboxylates, <*> beta</*>-diketonates, diols and\northo phenanthroline derivatives ) .\n\n\nThe variation of coulombic  spin-orbit (   4f ) , nephelauxetic ( <*> line over beta</*>, <*> delta</*>,\n b ) parameters4.6 in these complexes have also been\nconsidered to support the intensity data. \n\n\n  2 Results and Discussion  \n\n \n\nPraseodymium ( III ) an f2 ion, is the simplest lantha\nnide ion with f electron and with the stable oxidation state in aqueous and\nnon-aqueous media; it is not widely studied as compared to Nd ( III ) and Eu\n( III ) with f3 and f6 configurations.\n\n\nActually JuddOfelt theory works less satisfactorily for Pr ( III )\nas compared to other lanthanides6.7.\n\n\nThe calculation of P of 4f-4f transitions gives substantially high\nroot mean square values.\n\n\nThe  3H4 - >  3F2 transition of\nPr ( III ) , occurring around <*> aproximate-sign</*> 5200 cm-1,\nfollow selection rules for quadrupole transition and hence behaves as\nhypersensitive transition, but it is not generally studied in solution\nspectral analysis.\n\n\nPeacock found  3H4 <*> arrow</*> \n3P2 and  3H4 <*> arrow</*> \n1D2 transitions showing substantial sensitivity in\nphosphomolybdates and phosphotungstate8.\n\n\nSignificant variations of electric dipole intensity (\nT<*>lambda</*> ) where <*> lambda</*> = 2,4,6 specially T2\nparameter, have been shown for several solution spectral studies\ninvolving lanthanides in different coordination compounds9.10.\n\n\nSiddal and Stewart11 on the other hand reported the \n3H4 <*> arrow</*>  1I6, transiton to be\nhypersensitive which was strongly contested by Peacock8.\n\n\nIn order to explain the anomalous behaviour of Pr ( III ) , Carnall\n et al  ,  6 and Weber12 put forward a theory\nwhich considered certain assumption made in Judd-Ofelt theory.\n\n\nThe assumption considers the perturbation configurations degenerate\nand these lie  at higher energies than 4f-4f\ntransitions.\n\n\nThe inclusion of odd part of intensity expression improves the\ninterpretation of Pr ( III ) absorption spectra intensity slightly.\n\n\nIn  3H4 <*> arrow</*>  3P2, \n3P1,  3P0 multiplets, the <*> lambda</*> = 5\nreduced matrix elements are non zero.\n\n\nIt may be possible then that T5 may be contributing to the\nintensity at  3H4 <*> arrow</*>  3P2 and\n 3H4 <*> arrow</*>  3P1, because the \n3H4 <*> arrow</*>  3P2 and \n3H4 <*> arrow</*>  3P1 multiplets have <*>\nlambda</*> = 5 reduced matrix values <*> approximate- sign</*> 0.283 and\n0.502, while for  3H4 <*> arrow</*>  3P0\nmultiplet <*> lambda</*> = 5 has zero value.\n\n\nBut if this is the interpretation, the discrepancies in the values of\nP would then be more in  3H4 <*> arrow</*> \n3P2 transition observed by Peacock8 and also by\nus5b.13.14, thus, cannot be explained on this argument.\n\n\nPeacock8 considered the exceptional behabiour of Pr ( III )\nhypersensitivity, as one of the major problem in the lanthanide f-f\nintensity theory.\n\n\nThis appears most probably to be the reason why very few absorption\nspectral studies have been made on Pr ( III ) complexes. \n\n \n\nPeacock8 experienced difficulty in getting a good fit\nbetween the observed and the calculated values of  of various\ntransitions.\n\n\nOur procedure using partial and multiple regression\nmethod13-17 has yielded very good agreement between observed and\ncalculated P of  3H4 <*> arrow</*>  3P2\nand  3H2 <*> arrow</*>  1D2 transitions,\nwhile marginally overestimated values were found for  3H4\n<*> arrow</*>  3P1 and marginally underestimated\nvalues13.14.15.16.17 were found for  3H4 <*>\narrow</*>  3P0.\n\n\nThe RMS deviations in  of  3H4 <*>\narrow</*>  3P1 and  3H4 <*> arrow</*>\n 3P0 transitions computed by our method4.10.14\nwere of much smaller magnitude than those observed by Peacock7.8\nand Tandon and Mehta9. \n\n \n\nAn examination of  coefficients for U ( 2 )\n shows, that these are nearly equal in case of  3H4\n<*> arrow</*>  3P0 and  3H4 <*> arrow</*>\n 3P1 bands, hence these bands should have almost the same\nintensity.\n\n\nThe intensity of  3H4 <*> arrow</*> \n3P1 band is always found to be larger than that of \n3H4 <*> arrow</*>  3P0.\n\n\nOne way of making  of  3H4 <*>\narrow</*>  3P1 and  3H4 <*> arrow</*>\n 3P0 transition equal, is to equal the net intensity\ndifference (  3H4 <*> arrow</*>  3P1 )\n<*> arrow</*> (  3H4 <*> arrow</*>  3P0 )\nby giving a positive factor, a correction factor T-or we can use a negative\ncorrection factor T8(  3H4 <*> arrow</*> \n3P0 ) <*> arrow</*> (  3H4 <*> arrow</*> \n3P1 ) .\n\n\nWe feel it is too early to say, which one of these approaches is\nthe correct one.\n\n\nHowever, as experced, the introduction of these correction factors,\neliminated some of the discrepancy in the values of P of praseodymium( III )\n4f-4f transitions and tried to make T2 positive, but we do not want\nto say with definiteness, till the natureof T7 and T8 is\nknown with certainty.\n\n\nNo doubt the introduction of T7 and T8 lowers the\nRMS deviation between observed and calculated values of oscillator strengths\nof different 4f-4f transitions.\n\n\nWe are working in detail to find out the feasibility of these\ncorrection parameters by applying to a large number of spectra of Pr( III )\ncomplexes both in solid state as well as in solution4,5c. \n\n \n\nThe values of T<*>lambda</*> parameters have been found\nto consist of both vibronic and static part.\n\n\nThe T<*>ambda</*> parameters, as phenomenologically\nobtained, are a combination of T<*>lambda</*> due to static and\nvibronic perturbation.\n\n\nThe variation of T<*>lambda</*> with environmental changes,\ncan be determined by crystal field parameter At,p, which in turn\ndepends upon the position ( angular disposition and distance ) and charges of\nthe surrounding ligands.\n\n\nFor lanthanides other than Pr ( III ) , the T2 varies\nenormously with the environmental changes around metal ion, while\nT4 and T6 are almost insensitive to the environment, making\nthus the intensities of non-hypersensitive transitions of little use in\nsolving structural problems.\n\n\nThese 4f-4f transitions are weakly allowed, due to some mixing\nof the excited states of opposite parity into the ground state, as a result\nof configuration interacions.\n\n\nThis small mixing may be increased on complexation, if the energy\nof the excited state is lowered.\n\n\nAdditional intensity may be gained, by mixing of ligand and metal\nwave functions due to orbital overlap, with the result that the intensity of\nthe hypersensitive transition increases substantially.\n\n\nThe introduction of covalency in the metal-ligand bond improves the\npossibilty of mixing of the states of opposite parity, which is required for\nrelaxing the rules for f-f transitions and thereby leading to the\nintensification.\n\n\nIftikhar18 has recently observed the high intensification of\nhypersensitive transition which he ascribed to eigen perturbation.\n\n\nHe, however, could observe only marginal intensification in\nnon-hypersensitive transitions18. \n\n \n\nDuring the course of present work on Pr ( III ) complexes, it\nis observed, that though  3H4 <*> arrow</*> \n3P2,  3H4 <*> arrow</*> \n3P0  3H4 <*> arrow</*>  3P0\nand  3H4 <*> arrow</*>  1D2 transitions\nare not hypersensitive in orthodox sense, yet these exhibit high\nintensification and wide variation of oscillation strength.\n\n\nThese undergo changes under the inference of the structural\nfeatures and bonding characteristics of the ligands.\n\n\nThe complexes investigated belong to the ligands with widely\ndiffering binding features; fluorocarboxylates, fluorosulphates,\ntrifluoromethane sulphonate, <*> beta</*>-diketonates, diol\nderivatives; phenanthroline and bipyridine.\n\n\nThese complexes range between essentially outer sphere\ncomplexes to predominantly inner sphere complexes.\n\n\nThe complexes belonging to similar ligands have been placed and the\ndata on  and electric dipole Judd-Ofelt T<*>lambda</*>\nparameters along with energy interaction  (\nFk, Ek ) , nephelauxetic ( <*> line over beta </*> )\nbonding ( b) and covalency ( <*> delta</*> ) have been considered, for\ninterpreting the coordination environment around praseodymium ( III ) ,\nextent of involvement of metal 4f orbitals and degree of outer sphere-inner\nsphere coordination. \n\n \n\nThe fluorocarboxylates, fluorosulphates, trifluoromethane\nsulphonates, diol derivatives, and <*> beta </*> -  diketonates of\npraseodymium ( III ) all involve oxygen as coordinating sites.\n\n\nAll involve either bidentate or dimeric bridging attachment of\nligands in their crystalline derivatives.\n\n\nThe ortho-phenanthroline and bipyridine complexes of praseodymium\nindicate the presence of nitrogen environment around praseodymium ( III ) .\n\n\n\n  2.1 Fluorocarboxylates of praseodymium ( III ) \n\n\n \n\nThe fluorocarboxylates of praseodymium ( III ) of the type Pr (\nOOCR )  3 where R = CH2F, CHF2, CF3,\nC2F5, C3F7 and C6H4F\nand fluorosulphate Pr ( OSO2F )  3 and trifluoromethane\nsulphonate Pr ( CF3SO3 )  3 provide immediate\ncoordination environment comprising oxygen donor sites of these fluoro\nligands.\n\n\nIn case of fluorocarboxylates, the presence of three coordinated\nwater molecules provides non-coordinated environment around\npraseodymium, while fluorosulphate and trifluoromethane sulphonate involve\noctacoordinated praseodymium as a result of polymeric nature of these\ncompounds. \n\n \n\nThe energy interaction and the nephelauxetic ( <*> line over\nbeta</*>, b1 <*> delta</*> ) derived from the observed energies of\nthe transitions, show that there are significant changes in coulombic (\nFk, Ek ) parameters, computed from the spectra recorded at\npH <*> aooroxinate-sign</*> 2.0 and pH <*> approximate-sign</*> 6.0,\nsugests that at pH <*> approxinate-sign</*> 6.0 these fluorocarboxylates,\nfluorosulphate and trifluoromethane sulphonate moleties become far\nbetter ligands.\n\n\nIn fluorocarboxylaes themselves, as the number of fluorine in the\nalkyl group increases, the acid strength of acid increases.\n\n\nThe increase in the acidic strength of the ligand contributes\ntowards the decrease in the nephelauxetic effect and bonding parameter in\ntheir praseodymium ( III ) complexes. \n\n \n\nFluorosulphate and trifluoromethane sulphonate involve most\nprobably tetrameric unit with oxygen bridges of the trifluoromethane\nsulphonate and fluorosulphate group most probably involving\noctacoordinated praseodymium( III ) .\n\n\nThese dissolve in dimethyl sulphoxide and water.\n\n\nIn water these give weaker 4f-4f bands with substantially lesser\nmagnitude of nephelauxetic effect.\n\n\nThus in these compounds both components Atp ( t, odd ) of\nthe following equation appear to contribute towards the intensity of\n4f-4f transition and magnitude of T<*>lambda</*> parameters as\nshown below by equation of Judd19:  \n\n \n\nIn fluorocarboxylate derivatives themselves the oscillator\nstrength of 4f-4f transitions vary significantly specially for \n3H4 <*> arrow</*>  3P2 and \n3H4 <*> arrow</*>  1D2 transitions which are\npseudo-hypersensitive in nature.\n\n\nThe increased number of fluorine substituent appears to contribute\ntowards decrease in the intensity of f-f transition as well as lowering of\nthe nephelauxetic effect, bonding and covalency parameters.\n\n\nThis is understandable in view of the increased electron withdrawing\npower of different fluoroalkyl groups CH2F <*> greater than</*>\nCHF2 <*> greater than</*> CF3 <*> greater than</*>\nC2F5 <*> greater than</*> C3F7 \n\n \n\nComparing the energy and intensity data of these\nfluorocarboxylates, fluorosulphate and trifluoromethane sulphonate\ncomplexes of Pr ( III ) in water and dimethyl formamide and dimethyl\nsulphoxide, we find substantial changes.\n\n\nThe aqueous solution spectra yield weaker 4f-4f bands and smaller\nmagnitudes for nephelauxetic and bonding parameters, but these values are\nsubstantial as compared to that observed for Pr ( III ) aquo ion.\n\n\nIn dimethylformamide, however, the lowering of coulombic (\nFk, Ek ) , nephelauxetic parameter ( <*> line over beta</*> )\nis substantially greater while values of bonding ( b) and covalency ( <*>\n b</*> ) parameters increase significantly and thus pointing\ntowards increased incidence of covalency as a result of different\ncoordinating power of dimethylformamide and dimethylsulphoxide molecules.\n\n\nBorina20 has very recently reported that even in the solvent\ncomposition 50 : 50 water-DMSO the inner coordination shell of\npraseodymium consisted of dimethyl sulphoxide and this resulted in the\nisolation of [ Pr ( DMSO )  8 ]  3+.\n\n\nHowever, we have found that even in the solvent composition 80 : 20\nDMSO : water, the octa solvated complexes do not exist; only mixed solvato\ncomplexes of the type [ Pr ( DMSO )  x ( ligand ) \ny]3+ could be isolated.\n\n\nEven in pure dimethyl sulphoxide / dimethylformamide slowly the\nanionic ligands from inner coordination sphere move to the outer sphere\ncoordination, finally yielding octacoordinated solvent comlex of\npraseodymium ( III ) .",

{"text": "Musical Creativity : Its Affinity with Other Arts and its\nUniqueness   \n\n\n Premlata Sharma \n\n \n\n ` MUSIC'  in this paper refers to Indian music in\nparticular.\n\n\nThis word is taken here in its current meaning, covering vocal and\ninstrumental rendering, excluding dance. \n\n \n\nThe affinity of music with other arts is the most conspicuous in\nthe case of literature, specially in the Indian tradition because of the\nprime place accorded to vocal music and because of the textual component of\nvocal music, which is often meaningful, though non-lexical text is not\nruled out.\n\n\n<indig=sanskrit>  Nada  </indig=sanskrit> ( roughly tone )\nis the basic material of music and <indig=sanskrit>  varna \n</indig=sanskrit> ( syllable) is that of literature and both are inseparable\nin a way.\n\n\nHence we begin our enquiry with the affinity of music with literature.\n\n\n \n\nTalking of training, it would be interesting to cite Mammata who\nmentions training as one of the three factors that cumulatively contribute\nto poetic creativity. \n\n \n\n \" Inborn ability <indig=sanskrit>  ( sakti ) \n</indig=sanskrit> , proficiency <indig=sanskrit>  ( nipunata ) \n</indig=sanskrit> that is attained through observation of <indig=sanskrit>\n loka  </indig=sanskrit> or life and study of treatise of authority\n<indig=sanskrit>  ( sastra )  </indig=sanskrit> and practice\n<indig=sanskrit>  ( abhyasa )  </indig=sanskrit> according to\ninstruction received from the knowledgeable ones in literature, these\nthree cumulatively bring about the creation of literature.\"  \n\n \n\nAll these three factors are equally applicable in musical\ncreativity.\n\n\nInborn talent is the first requisite.\n\n\nThis is explained as <indig=sanskrit>  samskarn \n</indig=sanskrit> ( lit.impression ) or <indig=sanskrit>  vasana \n</indig=sanskrit> which could be explained as  ` the present\nconsciousnss of past perceptions'  ( Monier Williams ) ; this word is\nderived from the root <indig=sanskrit>  vas  </indig=sanskrit>\nmeaning  ` to perfume or scent'  .\n\n\nThe idea is that an impression permeates the mind as a scent\npermeates an object like a piece of cloth.\n\n\nIn Sanskrit idiom, <indig=sanskrit>   ` vasana' \n </indig=sanskrit> is a more basic word that is explained as\n<indig=sanskrit>  samskara  </indig=sanskrit> . \n\n \n\nWhile explaining the perception of musical intervals, Kumbha\nspeaks of the <indig=sanskrit>  anadi vasana  </indig=sanskrit> or\nbeginningless impression  in the listener and\nperformer.\n\n\nThus,  inborn talent  that is nothing but a bundle of\nimpressions accumulated in previous births, according to Indian thought, is\naccepted to play a vital role in musical creativity not only in performance,\nbut also in listening.\n\n\nThis could be said to be true of all the arts. \n\n \n\nIn the attainment of proficiency, the observation of\n<indig=sanskrit>  loka  </indig=sanskrit> i.e. the behaviour of\nstatic and dynamic beings <indig=sanskrit>  ( sthavarajangama ) \n</indig=sanskrit> and the study of treatises of authority <indig=sanskrit>\n ( sastra )  </indig=sanskrit> is said to be essential.\n\n\nWhile <indig=sanskrit>  loka  </indig=sanskrit> , which in\na wider view, could be said to include all aspects of life, inner and outer,\nis basic to any art, whether it is drama, music, literature, painting,\nsculpture or architecture, its presentation is direct in some arts and\nindirect in others.\n\n\nMusic falls in the latter category.\n\n\n<indig=sanskrit>  Natyasastra  </indig=sanskrit> speaks of\n<indig=sanskrit>  loka-vrtta  </indig=sanskrit> , as the object of\ndepiction and it has been said to be comprised of <indig=sanskrit> \nkarman  </indig=sanskrit> and <indig=sanskrit>  bhava \n</indig=sanskrit> that could be roughly translated as action and mental state\nor the  ` outer'  and  ` inner'  of life. \n\n \n\nMammata has enumerated the following disciplines that are\nprescribed for study by an aspirant of creativity in literature - -  \"\n<indig=sanskrit>  chandas  </indig=sanskrit> ( prosody ) ,\n<indig=sanskrit>  vyakarana  </indig=sanskrit> ( grammar),\n<indig=sanskrit>  abhidhana  </indig=sanskrit> ( vocabulary ) ,\n<indig=sanskrit>  kosa  </indig=sanskrit> ( lexicon),\n<indig=sanskrit>  kala  </indig=sanskrit> ( arts ) , the four\n<indig=sanskrit>  purusarthas  </indig=sanskrit> ( viz.,\n<indig=sanskrit>  dharma, artha, kama, moksa  </indig=sanskrit> )\nand the characteristics of elephants horses and weapons like swords.\"\n \n\n \n\nIt is interesting to compare the requisites of a musical composer\n<indig=sanskrit>  ( vaggeyakara )  </indig=sanskrit> outlined in\n<indig=sanskrit>  Sangita-Ratnakara  </indig=sanskrit> . \n\n \n\n \" <*> dotted line</*> a thorough knowledge of grammar,\nproficiency in lexicography, knowledge of prosody ( lit. differentiating\namong the various meters ) , proficiency in the use of ( different ) figures\nof speech, comprehension of aesthetic delight <indig=sanskrit>  ( rasa )\n </indig=sanskrit> as related to ( different ) emotive states of being\n<indig=sanskrit>  ( bhava )  </indig=sanskrit> , intelligent\nfamiliarity with local custom, knowledge of many languages, proficiency in\nthe scientific theories of fine arts, expert knowledge of <indig=sanskrit>\n laya  </indig=sanskrit> ( tempo ) , <indig=sanskrit>  tala\n </indig=sanskrit> ( musical tine ) and <indig=sanskrit>  kala\n </indig=sanskrit> , discrimination of different intonations, a\nversatile genius, a beautiful musical rendering, acquaintance with\nregional <indig=sanskrit>  ( desi ) ragas  </indig=sanskrit> ,\ncleverness in conversation for victory in debates, freedom from \"\nlike \" and \" dislike \" , aesthetic sensitivity, a\nsense of propriety in expression and new melodic forms, knowledge of  mind, maturity in the understanding of different (\nvarieties of ) <indig=sanskrit>  prabandhas  </indig=sanskrit> the\nability to compose songs at short notice, the expert  knowledge of composing different verbal structures for particular\nmelodic forms, maturity in producing <indig=sanskrit>  gamaka-s \n</indig=sanskrit> ( shakes and graces ) pervading the three registers,\nproficiency in ( the presentation of ) different ( forms of )\n<indig=sanskrit>  alapa  </indig=sanskrit> and attention.\" \n\n\n \n\nAn analysis of the aove requisites reveals that since the musical\ncomposer is required to compose the text of the song along with its melodic\nand rhythmic structure, his qualifications include those of the poet, the\nmusician and general qualities of the mind like attention, freedom from like,\ndislike etc.\n\n\nWe have to note here that prime position is given to vocal music in\nthe Indian tradition, on account of which the concept of a composer happens\nto be what is described above. \n\n \n\nThe third factor contributing to poetic creativity enumerated by\nMammata is <indig=sanskrit>  abhyasa  </indig=sanskrit> or practice\nbased on training under knowledgeable ones in literature.\n\n\nIn music, <indig=sanskrit>  abhyasa  </indig=sanskrit>\nplays an extremely vital role.\n\n\nBhartrhari has expounded <indig=sanskrit>  abhyasa \n</indig=sanskrit> as a <indig=sanskrit>  pramana  </indig=sanskrit>\nor means of valid knowledge in the perception of musical notes.\n\n\nIt is by repetitive listening that proficiency in the perception of\n<indig=sanskrit>  svaras  </indig=sanskrit> is acquired.\n\n\nSimilarly, <indig=sanskrit>   ` kriya'  \n</indig=sanskrit> , another name for <indig=sanskrit>  abhyasa \n</indig=sanskrit> or practice is a basic requisite of a performer of music.\n\n\nAll arts require practice, but for performing arts including music,\nit is indispensable.\n\n\nToday the element of training has almost vanished from literature.\n\n\n \n\nHaving dealt with the similarity between the reqisites of\ncreativity in literature and music, we could turn attention to the special\nfeatures that distinguish music as a performing art from other arts.\n\n\nIn a performing art, there is no finished product as such, creativity\nis concurrent with performance.\n\n\nThis is not the case with literature and visual arts.\n\n\nIn Indian music, the three functions of creativity, viz.,\nimagination, execution and evaluation are discharged simultaneously.\n\n\nSince pre-composed or pre-determined material forms a very small\npercentage of the material presented in art-music, imagination is also\nbrought into play by the performer.\n\n\nHe makes the mental images of tonal formations, renders them with\nvoice or on instruments and constantly evaluates whether or not his execution\nis upto the mark with reference to the image concerned.\n\n\nOf course, it should be noted that imagination in Indian music\noperates in the given framework of the <indig=sanskrit>  raga, tala\n </indig=sanskrit> and type of composition taken up for performance.\n\n\nThis framework  is handed down by tradition\nand is transmitted through training.\n\n\nNo other art has such a strong framework excepting, perhaps, temple\narchitecture.\n\n\nTradition here does not mean something static or rigid; it is a\ncontinuous flow of creativity that finds room within a given framework. \n\n \n\nThe above three functions are performed at three different stages\nby different persons in Western music, drama and architecture.\n\n\nIn Western music, the composer is responsible for imagination, the\nperformer for execution and the conductor for evaluation or interpretation.\n\n\nIn drama, the poet imagines, the actor executes and the director\nevaluates or interprets.\n\n\nIn architecture, the architect is the one who imagines, a team of\nworkers and artisans execute and the engineer or overseer evaluates and\ninterprets.\n\n\nThe crux of creativity lies in imagination and hence the composer,\npoet and architect enjoy an exalted position. \n\n \n\nWith regard to the creative process again, Indian music is unique\nbecause the corpus of the framework handed down by tradition is built up\nconstantly by unidentified musicians.\n\n\nTwo streams in musical creativity have been recognised - - one is\nreferential and the other is non-referential or autonomous.\n\n\n\" NS \" gives them the names <indig=sanskrit> \ngana  </indig=sanskrit> and <indig=sanskrit>  gandharva \n</indig=sanskrit> respectively.\n\n\nAbhinavagupta has elaborately elucidated the distinction between\nthe two.\n\n\nIn \" NS \" , the point of reference in the case of\nreferential music is naturally drama.\n\n\nEven otherwise, the referential component of any music is nothing\nbut a situation from life which includes both animate and inanimate beings.\n\n\nA situation itself is a drama in miniature form.\n\n\nWhen one creates music for drama or for a given situation, the\ncreativity springs from the  identification with the\ngiven situation.\n\n\nThis identification again as different from the common  identification with a situation in actual life. \n\n \n\nThe above point has been beautifully explained by\nAbhinavagupta in his commentary on <indig=sanskrit>  Dhvanyaloka\n </indig=sanskrit> , 1.5, where he discusses the identification of\nValmiki with the pathetic situation of one <indig=sanskrit>  kraunca\n </indig=sanskrit> bird out of the pair that was involved in\nlovemaking.\n\n\nHe says that Valmiki was not afflicted with grief, because if that\nwere so, the moment of poetic creativity would not have dawned upon him.\n\n\nCreativity is not possible in a moment of personal sorrow or joy, nor\nin a moment of identification  with a\nsituation from life that lands in affliction.\n\n\nThe element of distance is very essential in addition to\nidentification for reaching a state congenial to artistic creativity.\n\n\nThis is a moment of  ` release'  from the  `\nbondage'  of day-to-day life which functions in the triangle of\ntime-space, individual; here one comes face to face with the Universal.\n\n\nThis is allright so far as it goes.\n\n\nBut music has another dimension, also where a situation from life is\nnot relevant.\n\n\nThis dimension is referred to as the autonomy of music.\n\n\nIn traditional Indian thought, Abhinavagupta has spoken of this\nautonomy in unequivocal terms.\n\n\nHe say that <indig=sanskrit>  svara  </indig=sanskrit>\n ` heats'  the mind on account of its beauty and makes the\nlatter relinquish its normal state and then the <indig=sanskrit>  svara\n </indig=sanskrit>  ` throws'  itself into the mind.\n\n\nIt is notable that the <indig=sanskrit>  svara \n</indig=sanskrit> is not said to transmit any meaning or reference in the\nmind; it transmits itself.\n\n\nThis is the autonomy of music.\n\n\nMoreover, music is not representational, because it has no direct\nmodel in nature.\n\n\nThe sounds are there in nature, their structuring is done only by the\nhuman being.\n\n\nThis again explains the importance of training. \n\n \n\nIn Western thought,  ` absolute music'  and\n ` programme music'  are used for  ` music that is free\nfrom extra-musical implications'  and  ` music inspired by a\nnon-musical idea'  , respectively.\n\n\nIn Indian thought, <indig=sanskrit>  gandharva \n</indig=sanskrit> and <indig=sanskrit>  gana  </indig=sanskrit> are\nthe two words that were used for non-referential and referential music\nrespectively and drama was considered to be the source of referential music.\n\n\nMusic, independent of drama, developed its own corpus of  `\nreference'  by way of association of <indig=sanskrit>  ragas\n </indig=sanskrit> with the cycle of day and night, the six seasons and\nmasculinity-femininity.\n\n\nHangovers of this association are still surviving in art-music.\n\n\nThe system of <indig=sanskrit>  raga-dhyana \n</indig=sanskrit> that dominated the scene for more than five centuries is\nalso surviving in very lean hangovers.\n\n\n<indig=sanskrit>  Raga-dhyanas  </indig=sanskrit> provided\nminiature situations for music independent of drama and also acted as a\nbridge between the performer and the listener so far as the emotive content\nof music was concerned.\n\n\nAll this points to the fact that no water-tight compartment was\nconceived between referential and nonreferential music.\n\n\nEven <indig=sanskrit>  gandharva  </indig=sanskrit> uses\ntexts eulogizing the gods and goddesses and in them also situations bearing\nanalogy to life are not ruled out.\n\n\nThis music is closely related to ritualistic contexts like the\nrituals forming part of the <indig=sanskrit>  purvaranga \n</indig=sanskrit> of preliminaries  of drama.\n\n\nWe are not discussing Vedic music here.\n\n\nThe basic idea seems to be that the source of creativity could be\ntwo-fold - - one that does not serve the purpose of heightening or\nunderlining the depiction of a situation from life and the other that springs\nfrom the need of doing so. \n\n \n\n<indig=sanskrit>  Raga  </indig=sanskrit> - - music is\neven now being used in these two streams.\n\n\nThe <indig=sanskrit>  alapa  </indig=sanskrit> of a\n<indig=sanskrit>  raga  </indig=sanskrit> could be said to be\nnon-referential, in spite of the associations of some <indig=sanskrit> \nragas  </indig=sanskrit> surviving through hangovers.\n\n\nA vocal composition with meaningful text could bring in some\nreferences, but they are soon transcended in a performance because the\nmaximum attention is drawn towards <indig=sanskrit>  raga \n</indig=sanskrit> and <indig=sanskrit>  tala  </indig=sanskrit> .\n\n\nThis is the case in <indig=sanskrit>  dhrupad \n</indig=sanskrit> and <indig=sanskrit>  khyal  </indig=sanskrit>\nbut in <indig=sanskrit>  thumri  </indig=sanskrit> , the situation\npresented by the text receives the maximum attention and <indig=sanskrit>\n raga  </indig=sanskrit> and <indig=sanskrit>  tala \n</indig=sanskrit> are subservient to it.\n\n\nHence, it is a question of predominance of one over the other and\nnot one of absolute categories. \n\n \n\nIn view of the above discussion, it could be said that\ncreatvity in Indian art-music is either <indig=sanskrit> \nraga-centred  </indig=sanskrit> or situation-centred where\n<indig=sanskrit>  raga  </indig=sanskrit> is made subservient to a\nsituation.\n\n\nWe have discussed to some extent the proecss of situation-centred\ncreativity.\n\n\nWhen this centre is not in operation, the whole corpus of\n<indig=sanskrit>  raga  </indig=sanskrit> handed down by tradition\nand nurtured in the  own consciousness becomes the spring\nof creativity.\n\n\nNo other art has been endowed with such a rich corpus for creativity\nwithin a frame.\n\n\nOnly temple architecture could be said to be an exception here.\n\n\nThe freshness of creativity remains intact in spite of the\nindispensability of existing frame-work. \n\n \n\nAlthough we have said above that the presence or absence of\nextra-musical references is not accepted as an absolute or exclusive\ncategory, it cannot but be affirmed that music does offer full scope for\neliminating external references.\n\n\nHere again a note of caution is relevant.\n\n\nElimination of external reference only means that such a reference is\nnot projected or presented.\n\n\nAll the same, it is to be remembered that the coming into being of a\nreference in the mind of the performer/composer or listener cannot be ruled\nout and is not an object of disdain.\n\n\nMusic is not something isolated from life and in spite of its strong\npotential for non-referential use, it cannot be expected to be absolutely\nfree of referential association.\n\n\nIndian thought.  has, therefore, not\nformulated exclusive categories like absolute music and programme music.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9e36e977-d3d0-4f8f-a46b-ef6eedebd793", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.176243+00:00"}

{"text": "Cost-plus Railways  \n\n \n\nIT IS ASTONISHING that within a fortnight of the release of the\nStatus Paper on Indian Railways, the Union Minister of Railways, Mr. George\nFernandes, has come out with budget proposals for a hefty Rs. 892 \ncrore  from higher freight and passenger charges.\n\n\nThe additional revenue to be raised in 1990-91 will be the largest\never in a year, exceeding the Rs.  876-crore  increase in the\ncurrent financial year.\n\n\nAnd while the former Union Minister of Railways, Mr. Madhavrao\nScindia, left passenger fares untouched, Mr. Fernandes has spared no class of\nrailway users.\n\n\nThe status paper was meant to generate a debate on the ways and means\nby which the Railways could meet future demand for services.\n\n\nYet, with the focus on higher rates in the Railway budget, Mr.\nFernandes seems to have already decided that there is only one way by which\nadditional services can be provided.\n\n\nIn retrospect, it now appears that the status paper with its emphasis\non declining budgetary support for Plan investment, the burden of interest\ncommitments to the exchequer and the cost of maintaining uneconomic routes,\nwas only preparing the case for a substantial rise in railway rates.\n\n\nThere is no denying that despite vastly improved functioning and\nsubstantial increases in both freight and passenger rates during the 1980s,\nthe Railways continues to be short of funds for modernisation and track\nextension.\n\n\nThe Plan outlay for 1990-91 has been raised to Rs. 5,000  crore\n , from Rs. 4,450  crore  in 1989-90.\n\n\nBut this is substantially short of the average annual investment of\nRs. 7,300  crore  that the Railways has projected as its\nrequirement during the Eighth Plan. \n\n \n\nHowever, notwithstanding all the arguments in favour of ( almost)\nyearly increases in rail charges, two crucial issues have been swept under\nthe carpet.\n\n\nHas the Railways done all it can to improve the cost efficiency of\noperation so that at least a part of resource requirements can be met without\nrecourse to higher user charges?\n\n\nAnd, is the present system of raising freight rates in conformity\nwith recommendations of earlier tariff commissions?\n\n\nThe answer in both cases is in the negative.\n\n\nHigher productivity in terms of better wagon and track utilisation\nwas achieved during the 1980s, but this was not without corresponding\nincrease in operating costs.\n\n\nAs for the manner of increasing freight rates, successive ad-hoc\nincreases ( including in this  budget) have not been in line\nwith the recommendations of the 1980-81 committee on this subject, especially\nwith respect to the principle of what the traffic can bear.\n\n\nIn such a situation there is little point in appointing a new tariff\ncommittee as announced by Mr. Fernandes.\n\n\nThe innovation introduced this time of a lower freight rate\nbetween April and September will hardly encourage shippers to use the\nRailways.\n\n\nThe trend of a shift towards road transport will continue with only\nthe transporters of bulk goods using rail transport because they have little\nchoice.\n\n\nSince commodities like coal, pig iron and cement are critical inputs\nfor infrastructural industries, higher transportation costs will have an\nobvious effect on the price level.\n\n\nIn short, what we have been presented with is a budget that prices\nservices according to prevailing costs, rather than one that attempts to\neconomise on costs to provide, at least in part, the necessary resources for\nbetter and expanded services.\n\n\nNotwithstanding the larger allocations made to the Depreciation\nReserve Fund ( to be drawn on for track renewal etc), this kind of cost-plus\npricing hurts the economy in general and the travelling public in particular.\n\n\n \n\nThe decision to discontinue production of first-class coaches on\n \" egalitarian\"  grounds will, contrary to Mr.  claims, make little difference to capacity available for\nsecond-class passengers as the Railways had already decided to phase out such\ncoaches in favour of the more popular air-conditioned sleeper coaches.\n\n\nOne positive feature of Mr.  budget is that the\none new project proposed to be taken up this year, the West Coast line, will\nbe funded differently.\n\n\nAs already announced, a separate corporation is to be set up with the\njoint participation of the beneficiary States.\n\n\nThis should hasten completion of this long-delayed project. \n\n\n  Soviet presidency  \n\n \n\nAfter two days of hard bargaining in the Congress of  Deputies, the Soviet  super Parliament, Mr. Mikhail\nGorbachev has managed to have the essence of his reform legislation passed.\n\n\nAlthough the abolition of Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution (\nwhich guarantees the Communist  monopoly over power) and the\nestablishment of the executive presidency are logically interlinked, there\nwas strong resistance from the radical reformists, the Inter-Regional Group\nof Deputies, to the executive presidency.\n\n\nThey felt that there were few checks and balances on the  sweeping powers.\n\n\nThe legislation has now been adopted after amending these powers to\nallow the President to block a Bill only once and to permit him to declare an\nemergency only after consulting the constituent republics of the union.\n\n\nOnce the new laws come into effect and the Soviet \nfirst freely elected Parliament is constituted and the President assumes\noffice, the country will have what is essentially the United \nsystem of choosing its legislature and executive, but with perhaps less\npresidential power to override legislation.\n\n\nIn a few days Mr. Gorbachev is certain to be elected the first Soviet\nPresident with executive power, opposition to his candidature being token.\n\n\nHis powers as executive President would in any case have been no\ngreater than what he currently enjoys as General Secretary of the CPSU, even\nif amendments to the reform legislation had not been accepted.\n\n\nBut the radical reformists certainly had a valid point because in a\ndemocratic system the executive head, even if elected, must be more\nanswerable to the elected legilsature than the head of the Communist Party\nhas been under the old system. \n\n \n\nNow that the political system stands on the threshold of a major\nchange, Mr. Gorbachev will have to address the criticism, growing intense in\nrecent days, that economic reform under  perestroika  has been\nproceeding too slowly and with little tangible result.\n\n\nThe legislation now passed by the Congress has also amended the\nConstitution to allow private ownership of productive enterprises.\n\n\nRapid economic change to dismantle bureaucratic control of the\neconomy must follow soon. \n\n Even before assuming the executive presidency, Mr. Gorbachev has been\npresented with what must be a major challenge to the new dispensation - - the\nnationalist unrest in the republics.\n\n\nOn the eve of the Congress session, the new Lithuanian Supreme Soviet\nmet in Vilnius and declared the republic an independent state, formally\nnullifying the Baltic   \" voluntary\"  merger\nwith the Soviet Union in 1940.\n\n\nMr.  initial reaction that the declaration was\nillegal and that he would not negotiate - - one negotiates only with foreign\ngovernments - - was softened to saying that a dialogue ( as distinct from\nnegotiations) must be held.\n\n\nFor the present  secession is essentially\nsemantic.\n\n\nEven in the long run, the economic bonds between Moscow and Vilnius\nmay remain as strong as they are now.\n\n\nBut since Mr. Gorbachev has already promised to formulate a mechanism\nby which any Soviet republic can secede, it is of the utmost importance that\nthis be done soon and Lithuania be fitted into the lawful secession framework\nif it persists in wanting to leave.\n\n\nOther republics will then feel confident that they have a certain\nright which they may ultimately not need to use if the federal structure of\nthe union is made more equitable.  \n\n\n\n\n  Gold always shines  \n\n \n\nTHE PROPOSED ABOLITION of the Gold Control Act will stop\nharassment of goldsmiths and end the corruption that has permeated the gold\n interaction with government agencies.\n\n\nBut it will not put a stop to the large-scale smuggling of gold and\nthe foreign exchange loss that goes with such smuggling.\n\n\nTo end smuggling, measures will have to be taken to increase legal\nsupplies since there is no way the Indian appetite for the yellow metal can\nbe curbed.\n\n\nOne of the objectives of the Gold Control Act was to curb the demand\nfor gold.\n\n\nBut what the Act achieved instead was the creation of a premium on\ndomestic prices, making smuggling all the more attractive. \n\n \n\nIndia produces two tonnes of gold every year, while annual demand\nis estimated to be 150 tonnes at the very minimum.\n\n\nTo be sure, abolition of the Gold Control Act will encourage\nrecycling of at least some of the vast amount of gold hoarded in the country.\n\n\nBut it is unlikely that releases from gold hoards will be large\nenough to meet domestic demand.\n\n\nGold is not just a perfect hedge against inflation, its real value is\nforever appreciating.\n\n\nHence, the larger part of domestic holding will remain where they\nare.\n\n\nA suggestion made by government committees as well as by the gold\ntrade is to permit ( subject to payment of duty) Indians travelling abroad\nand visiting non-resident Indians to bring in a small quantity of gold.\n\n\nIt has been estimated that with an allowance of up to 100 grams for\nan arriving passenger, annual supplies can be augmented by close to 100\ntonnes. \n\n \n\nA valid argument against this proposal is that it confers a\nprivilege on those wealthy enough to travel or live abroad and allows them to\nprofit from domestic sale of imported gold as well.\n\n\nBut is there any alternative?\n\n\nThe current fall in gold prices is in all likelihood no more than a\ntemporary fallout of the proposed abolition of the Gold Control Act which has\nbeen attributed to market nervousness.\n\n\nA 55 per cent mark-up on international gold price will not disappear\njust with the removal of the Act.\n\n\nA whole edifice of foreign exchange leakage and black money\ngeneration has been built on the smuggling that thrives on the shortfall in\ndomestic supplies.\n\n\nAugment supplies and the edifice will crumble.\n\n\nHence, abolition of the Gold Control Act should be the first and not\nthe last step in bringing some order to the domestic market. \n\n\n  Bold move  \n\n \n\nOn the face of it, the Karnataka Chief Minister, Mr. Veerendra\nPatil, has done his Government proud by spurning the blandishments of the\nliquor  \" lobby\"  .\n\n\nIn a climate of cynicism Mr. Patil deserves kudos for laying bare the\npolitician-trader nexus and charging manufacturers with offering kickbacks\nin return for jointly cheating the exchequer.\n\n\nThe ostensible provocation for the Chief  outburst\non the floor of the Karnataka legislature on Wednesday was the publication of\nan advertisement by a liquor manufacturer the day before to protest against\nfresh imposts on beer and Indian made foreign liquor ( IMFL) and threatening\nto move production units away.\n\n\nAn attempt by a manufacturer to influence the Chief Minister plainly\nbounced on him when his tribe was hauled up for  \" falsifying\"\n documents to establish exports to other States and for manipulation\nto install pliable excise officials in place of scrupulous ones.\n\n\nMr.  observations could not have been wholly\nimpulsive because the hike on IMFL export duty from Re. 1 to Rs. 20 per bulk\nlitre had beeen virtually designed to punish greedier manufacturers.\n\n\nMr. Patil revealed that after accounting for supplies to the defence\nsector, a substantial portion of what was shown as exports to other States\nwas actually sold in Karnataka.\n\n\nHe had therefore ensured that excise rules had been tightened so that\nbottles did not leave the State without security labels.\n\n\nPerhaps he had driven the  \" lobby\"  he had in mind to\nthe wall, though the Mysore Sales International Limited ( MSIL), which was\nappointed the sole distributor, currently has its rights under scrutiny\nfollowing a plea in the Supreme Court.\n\n\nThe  \" lobby\"  could be in trouble there too because\nif the Chief Minister has his way he will stake the  claim to\ndistributorship in exports and imports as well.\n\n\nHe was on the offensive on Wednesday while awaiting the Supreme  verdict and clarified that he was anxious to effect a wholesale\ntakeover of liquor distribution so that all revenue leakages could be\nplugged.\n\n\nMr.  endeavours will have a wide measure of public\nsupport, particularly when they are aimed at raising resources for\ndevelopmental activity. \n\n \n\nThe best the more avaricious manufacturers can now do is convey\nto Mr. Patil that they have learnt their lesson and will henceforth pay more\nregard to excise regulations.\n\n\nHowever, only time will tell now long the Chief Minister can sustain\nhis zeal for such laudably public-spirited objectives and whether concern for\nprobity can consistently transcend personal and party affiliations.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "eeadff90-8808-4648-9fb6-827eb9e3ed9d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.178810+00:00"}

{"text": "SCIENCE UPDATE  \n\n\n  When The Sun Changes Its Spots    \n\n \n\n\"  A  LEOPARD cannot\nchange its spots \" , they say.\n\n\nBut the Sun can and does.\n\n\nAny increase in solar activity has a profound impact on human lives\nand world events.\n\n\nThis is now fairly well established. \n\n \n\nThe sun is a fascinating and amazing star burning 60  crore\n tonnes of hydrogen a second.\n\n\nThe sun, about 100 times the  diameter ( 1.39 million\nkm as against 12,700 km dialmeter of the Earth), is 150 million km away\nfrom our planet.\n\n\nThe surface temperature of the sun is about 6000 Kelvin and it may\nbe surprising to many that while it takes eight minutes for the  energy to reach the earth, it takes a million years for it to go from\nthe  core to its surface. \n\n \n\nThe dark, mysterious patches on the  surface ( dark\nbecause these are cooler, at 4000 degrees K, than the rest of the surface)\nare called  ` sunspots'  .\n\n\nCalling a sunspot a  ` spot'  is a masterpiece of\nunderstatement - - the biggest of these are equivalent to 11 earths in\ndiameter!\n\n\nThese sunspots multiply every 11 years in a cycle from the solar\nminimum to the solar maximum ( when the number of sunspot reaches a peak).\n\n\n \n\nDuring the solar maximum year, the sun has violent\nconvulsions.\n\n\nHuge storms erupt sudenly from the  upper reaches\nlashing the solar system with X-rays and hurling dangerous debris towards\nthe earth.\n\n\nBright flashes called  ` solar flares'  erupt 800,000\nkms into space.\n\n\nBig bursts of luminous gas also rise thousands of kms above the  surface. \n\n \n\nThe tidal wave of radiation, electric and magnetic fields and\nhigh energy particles spiralling out from the sun causes radio blackouts and\nelectrical damage.\n\n\nOn earth, radio communications are disrupted and transformers in\npower lines overheart and short circuit. \n\n \n\nAnd the only redeeming features is the spectacular bright\ndisplays of northern lights, or   ` Aurora Borealis'\n  .\n\n\nThe sun demonstrates its awesome power with these fiery upheavals\naccompanying the increased sunspot activity which bears a correlation with\nterrestrial phenomena. \n\n \n\nThe sunspots discovered by Galileo in 1610, perform their\nmysterious 11 year dance, appearing closer and closer to the \nequator and in greater numbers as each 11 year cycle progresses.\n\n\nThe sunspot cycle has been blamed for misfortunes ranging from\nerratic weather patterns to stock market crashes. \n\n \n\nWay back in 1801, William Herschel concluded that between 1650\nand 1800 he could establish a connection between  sunspot frequency and crop yields.\n\n\nHistorical records reveal that during 1645 to 1715 with no clear 11\nyear cycles and little or no sunspots, the  \" Little Ice Age\" \nhad set in.\n\n\nA two to five per cent decrease in solar irradiance is enough to\ntrigger off another \" Ice Age \" .\n\n\nIn fact, a one-degree difference in ocean surface temperature is\nsufficient to turn a calm into a storm. \n\n \n\nRainfall in India oscillates with the 11-year cycle according to\na statistical analysis of rainfall over several parts of the country.\n\n\nResearchers have accumulated compelling evidence of the influence\nof sunspots on terrestrial climate.\n\n\nScientists contend that during solar flares, the electrically\ncharged particles spewed out may change the conductivity of the upper\natmosphere ( extending from 15 km to 24 km above the  surface ) .\n\n\nThe ozone structure in this  ` stratosphere'  can also\nbe attested due to solar ultraviolet radiation thereby affecting the weather.\n\n\nThe ozone layer traps and absorbs the  ultraviolet\nradiation like a heat shield. \n\n \n\nThe relation between the sunspot cycles and the relative numbers\nof sunspots for a period of 200 years from 1750 to 1950 AD depicts tellingly\nthe tantalising impact of the Sun on epochal events in world history.\n\n\nThe seven-year great war ( 1756- 1763) which catapulted Britain to\nvictory and vanquished Russia and France coincided with the solar maximum\nperiod.\n\n\n1789, year of the French Revolution, also witnessed sunspots passing\nthe peak.\n\n\nSimilarly, during high sunspots activity in 1805 and 1815 the\nBattle of Trafalgar and Waterloo were fought respectively. \n\n \n\nThe year 1857 was the historic year of the Sepoy Mutiny or the\nFirst War of Indian Independence.\n\n\nThis was the time when the sunspots were approaching the maximum.\n\n\nAnd before they could cross the solar maximum, the American Civil War\nbroke out, which lasted from 1861 to 1865.\n\n\nThe solar maximum year 1870 was also the year of a fierce war between\nFrance and Germany. \n\n \n\nSignificantly enough, the intense sunspot activity in 1904-05\ncoincided with the historic encounter between Russia and Japan.\n\n\nThe four years of the First World War ( 1914-1918) constituted a\nperiod of solar hyperactivity. \n\n \n\nAs the sunspots began to wane in 1917, Russia was thrown in the\nthroes of a bloody Bolshevik revolution with farreaching consequences.\n\n\n \n\nEnter the Second World War ( 1939-1945).\n\n\nWorld peace was endangered and the horror of Hitler enveloped the  nations.\n\n\nThis period was also in the vice-like grip of the mysterious and\nmeancing sunspots. \n\n \n\nIn 1947, the year of Indian independence and also the\nbeginning of the end of the British Empire the relative number of sunspots\nin this year was a staggering 160, the maximum since 1750, till that year.\n\n\n \n\nInvestigators have also drawn up a correlation between\nsunspots and sanity.\n\n\nIn 1943, N.J. Siberling suggested that the sunspots could affect\nhuman psychology.\n\n\nThe maximum sunspot years are characterised by increased number of\nsuicides, violent incidents, wars, tragic deaths of world leaders while the\nminimum sunspot years have seen stable prices, a good economy, peace and\nfairly normal human behaviour.\n\n\nFloods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes and other natural\ncalamities coincide with the solar maximum period.\n\n\nPeople have found the link even in such unlikely places as\nmarriage.\n\n\nIt has been found that the year 1979, marked by the \nhyperactivity, was also a year when a record number of marriages took\nplace!   \n\n \n\n\n  focus   <*> thick line across the page</*>  <*> line </*>\n\n\n  100 years from now <*> dotted line</*>   <*>\nline </*>   <*> bold line </*>  Science  <*>\nbold line </*> \n\n \n\n    By    the time the\npoachers finish laying the crude yet effective trap, it is almost sunset in\nthe sparse but vast forest of the Kenyan National Game Reserve.\n\n\nThen they settle themselves behind some bushes, a kilometre off, to\nwait for some returning wild elephants.\n\n\nSure enough, an hour later, two elephants come sauntering down the\npath.\n\n\nThe first pass without falling into the five foot deep pit.\n\n\nThe second is not so lucky.\n\n\nWith a crashing sound she comes down over the pointed stakes.\n\n\nSome pierce into her belly.\n\n\nWith her leg broken she is doomed.\n\n\nThe poachers then close in.\n\n\nUsing high powered rifles they fell the first one too with three\nbullets to its head.\n\n\nBy midnight the long curving ivory tusks are sawed off.\n\n\nBy sunrise the poachers are out of the Game Reserve, carrying with\nthem their prize possession, which will find a ready market among the illicit\nivory traders in Nairobi.\n\n\nTwo more majestic beasts fall prey to  greed. \n\n \n\nThe picture is the same elsewhere.\n\n\nIn the Kaziranga Game Reserve, poachers are after the one-horned\nrhino.\n\n\nThey will get fabulous amounts for the horn which is mistakenly\nbelieved to have magical and medicinal values.\n\n\nThe days of  \" Moby Dick\"  are not yet over.\n\n\nHundreds of whales are systematically harpooned from trawlers in\nthe South Pacific.\n\n\nApart from the oil and bones, whale meat forms a large proportion of\nthe protein diet of the present Japanese. \n\n   Maharajas  may not go out with an\nelaborate entourage these days on hunting expeditions they previously called\n \" sports\"  , but some of our wealthy citizens would not mind\nthe presence of a majestic skin of a spotted leopard on the centre table of\ntheir grandly decorated sitting rooms.\n\n\nMost Western ladies still find it fashionable to wear a mink coat on\nexclusive occasions - - the fur a sign of opulence rather than a protection\nagainst cold. \n\n \n\n thoughtlessness nearly drove the tiger and the\nmink to extinction.\n\n\nWidespread protection programmes saved them just in the nick of time.\n\n\nThe African elephant and the rhino are on the endangered list.\n\n\nIf the killings go on unchecked, there may not be any more wild ones\n30 years from now.\n\n\nThey will be confined to zoos and colourful  story\nbooks. \n\n \n\nOthers have not been    too   lucky.\n\n\nTake for instance the great auk - - sometimes called the penguin of\nthe Northern hemisphere.\n\n\nThis big flightless sea-bird was once abundant in the North\nAtlantic.\n\n\nIn 1534, the French explorer Jacques Cartier and his \ncrew landed in Newfoundland.\n\n\nThey butchered some of the great auks for meat.\n\n\nThe feathers, they found, were ideal for pillows and cushions.\n\n\nThe wave caught on.\n\n\nBy 1840, feather and bird-meat collectors exterminated the bird.\n\n\nIt is now extinct. \n\n \n\nAnd so is the dodo - - another flightless and awkward looking\nbird that existed on the island of Mauritius.\n\n\nDutch and Portuguese sailors exterminated it by 1681.\n\n\nThe Maoris are guilty of yet another extinction.\n\n\nThe giant ostrich-like bird, the moa, previously found in New Zealand\nis no more.\n\n\nIt is an unending tale and a very long list bears testimony to the\nfact that man has been directly responsible for exterminating hundreds of\nbirds and animals, either from lust or lack of understanding and knowledge\nabout the ecological consequences. \n\n \n\nFrom 1600 A.D. biologists have been documenting plant, bird and\nanimal species scientifically.\n\n\nRecords since then show a grim and ominous picture.\n\n\nOut of the 4226 living species of mammals catalogued in 1620, it is\ncertain 46 have become extinct today while at least 152 are on the endangered\nlist.\n\n\nSome of them are on the verge of extinction.\n\n\nAfter two decades we may not see the likes of the lovable giant\npanda, the white snow leopard or the  Arabian oryx. \n\n \n\nBirds are probably the hardest hit.\n\n\nOf the 8684 documented species, 112 have become extinct during the\nlast 350 years.\n\n\nAs many as 1666 are on the verge of extinction or extremely rare.\n\n\nMost orinthologists are sure the number of extinct species are\nlarger as some have not been sighted for over a decade, despite the presence\nof thousands of avid bird watchers all over the world.\n\n\nWe no longer will see the passenger pigeon, at one time probably the\nmost abundant species of bird ever documented.\n\n\nDuring the middle of the 19th century its population was\nestimated to be an incredible 3.5 billion.\n\n\nYet hunting on a massive scale dwindled them very fast.\n\n\nBy the early part of this century, a few dozen were left.\n\n\nThe last surviving passenger pigeon died in the Cincinnati Zoo on\nSeptember 1, 1914. \n\n \n\nDesperate efforts are now under way to save others from imminent\nextinction.\n\n\nA decade from now the whooping crane may not spread its seven foot\nwings out to dry in the sun, or the Californian condor soar noiselessly in\nthe skies.\n\n\nLike them, the midget sized  warbler may also\nbecome extinct. \n\n \n\nApart from birds and animals, thousands of other  flora\nand fauna  have become extinct or are on the verge of doing so.\n\n\nThe big ones get noticed - - the small, silent ones die out without\na whimper.\n\n\nFor example in a recent extensive survey in the rivers of Malaysia,\nbiologists failed to find even a single specimen of 144 species of tropical\nfish out of the previously catalogued 266 types.\n\n\nThey are feared to be extinct.\n\n\nIt is estimated that about 40 per cent of all types of freshwater\nsnails may be already extinct or on the verge of extinction.\n\n\nUnderwater life-forms are also getting depleted.\n\n\nMarine biologists feel that already a few hundred marine organisms\nhave become extinct out of the estimated 80,000 species - - a possibility\nborne out by world-wide dwindling of coral reefs which harbour most of\nthem. \n\n \n\nWidespread deforestation is having its toll on plant life,\nthe worst hit are the tropical rain forests of the Amazon and South-East\nAsia.\n\n\nDestruction of the forest is not only exterminating rare plant\nspecies, but also destroying the habitat of hundreds of species of birds,\ninsects, invertebrates and mammals.\n\n\nBotanists are alarmed at the ever increasing list of extinct algae,\nfungi, flowering plants as also trees.\n\n\nThe phytoplankton ( a green microscopic sized algae) that abounds\nin the oceans, supply life-giving oxygen to the atmosphere by\nphotosynthesis, like all plants.\n\n\nThere is strong evidence to suggest that like forests the\nphytoplankton is also dwindling.\n\n\nLess oxygen is therefore being pumped back into the atmosphere.\n\n\nWhat will happen if the phytoplankton become extinct? \n\n \n\nMany factors are combining to cut down \nbiodiversity.\n\n\nHunting and killing of animals and birds or the felling of trees\nfaster than they can breed or grow is only one of the reasons.\n\n\nIt is not the most important one.\n\n\nDestruction of habitat due to encroachment and exploitation by man\nis proving to be much more harmful.\n\n\nIt requires hundreds of years for life-forms to adapt themselves to\na new environment.\n\n\nEver increasing human population, increased urbanisation and\ndeforestation is taking its expected toll on other life-forms. \n\n \n\nPollution, a legacy for  unplanned industrial\ngrowth is the other offender.\n\n\nA complex interrelated network exists between lower life-forms\nand higher ones.\n\n\nPollution strikes them both.\n\n\nMan being a part of the complex chain has to be affected by the\ndeclining biodiversity.\n\n\nIt does not require too much far sightedness to gauge the\nseriousness of the situation.\n\n\nIntroduction of certain foreign species into new areas artificially\nby man is sometimes proving to be a disaster.\n\n\nIn  Lake Victoria, a large fish, the Nile perch,\nhas already multiplied uncontrollably and eaten up several species of smaller\nfish which have gone extinct in the lake.\n\n\nThe perch was introduced to help develop local fisheries.\n\n\nThe mongoose, a native of Asia, was purposely introduced in the\nsugar fields of the West Indies, to put a check on rats that harmed crops.\n\n\nThe mongoose not only wiped off the rats but also subsequently\nexterminated several species of amphibians, reptiles and birds that\nindirectly helped to reap a good harvest.\n\n\nWidespread eucalyptus plantations to help aforestation are\nreportedly preventing or stunting the growth of other plants in the area.\n\n\nA few more such inadvertent experiments may create more ecological\ndamage than solving them. \n\n \n\nAt the rate we are going scientists estimate that within the\nnext 100 years we may lose about a million of the       life-forms, which now stands documented at around two\nmillion.\n\n\nAt present we are losing 5 to 10 per cent per decade.\n\n\nAs the highest life-form on earth it is up to us to preserve it.\n\n\nThe question is are we already too late?", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fceb43dd-9f56-4394-a292-07c7720110c4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.181069+00:00"}

\n\n\nThis is not the first time that such things happened.\n \n\n \n\nYou can very well make use of my letters if they\nare good for  \nyour purpose. \n\n\nPlease do not give my name. \n\n\nI do not keep the old letters. \n\n\nI write more than 600 letters a year and get more or\nless same  \namount. \n\n\nIf I keep all the letters it would become a mountain\nin few  time! \n\n\nOnly if the letters contain some important\ninformations, I keep  \nthem.  \n\n \n\nI will also write to Mr. Hegde soon. \n\n\nDo you have agricultural universities in Maharashtra?\n\n\nWe have such in Bihar. \n\n\nSome such universities with Government help can\nbring Olive  \ntrees. \n\n\nOnly if the government is interested we can bring\nsuch trees to  \nIndia. \n\n\nPrivate persons are not allowed to introduce new\nplants to our  \ncountry.  \n\n \n\nI have seen on television that special palmtrees\nwere brought to  \n   Malaysia   and Indonesia for\nproducing oil. \n\n\nThough it was a great success the monculture changed\nthe face of the  \ncountryside. \n\n\nBesides the terrain where these palmtrees were\nplanted were good for  \nother crops. \n\n\nThough it has brought economic gain, it did harm to\nthe nature. \n\n\nWe must not use good land, where we can produce other\ncrops, to plant olive trees. \n\n\nWe must use only useless land, stony, rocky and poor\nin water  \nfacilities, to plant the trees. \n\n\nThat way we will give beauty to barren land making it\ngreen and come to help the nature itself. \n\n\nBy doing so the poor people around will have some\nadditional income.  \n\n \n\nWhen I went through Israel, Greece, Spain,\nFrance, Portugal and  \nItaly and saw the plantation of Olive trees, I thought about\nbringing them to  \nour country especially to the stony places. \n\n\nIt would surely bring great help to the people and\nalso will improve  \ntheir health since olive oil is one of the best oils.  \n\n \n\nIf you are coming to Europe it must be before\nAugust. \n\n\nI will be away in August. \n\n\nSeptember onwards will be very cold for you. \n\n\nThose who are not used to the cold it will be\nimpossible to manage here. \n\n\nWe have now minus 15 degree centigrade in the night. \n\n\nAll the ponds, lakes, small rivers etc. are frozen. \n\n\nWe cannot stay outside for longer period. \n\n\nIf we are on the move it is OK. \n\n\nIn the houses there is heating. \n\n\nSo work fast and come in June or july. \n\n\nThat is the best time to come. \n\n\nYou and your wife are most welcome. \n\n\nIf she is coming for the first time you must take her\nto many places in Europe. \n\n\nFrom England you must take undersea tunnel train to\ncome to Paris. \n\n\nAfter seeing Paris take the train to Brussels, then\nto Germany. \n\n\nYou can stay as long as you want with me. \n\n\nFrom here it may be good to go through Vienna in\nAustria to Rome. \n\n\nIn Italy you must see Venice, Florence, Pisa and\nRome. \n\n\nYou can fly back to India from Rome. \n\n\nYou must buy Eurail pass from India for the train\ntrip in Europe. \n\n\nOtherwise it will be very costly to travel in Europe.\n \n\n \n\nI do not know if you have travelled extensively\nin Europe. \n\n\nThere are many interesting places to see.  \n\n \n\nI know that you must have sent the fax from some\noffice. \n\n\nSince you do not have a fax, I have to send this\nletter by mail.  \n \n\n\nWishing  grace and blessing on you and\nyour family, I  \nremain. \n\n\nYours, sd/-  XYZ", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "da49ef0e-6cb7-40ff-a9aa-f7f6e1bd9fa1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.182465+00:00"}

Chief Personnel Officer, Southern Railway, Madras.\n\n \n\n \"   THE   plurality of\nmeaning reminds one of the old story of blind men coming across an elephant\non the road - - each group in the country sees the same elephant, i.e., \n\" The Concept of Workers Participation \"  from a\ndifferent angle.\n\n\nThe owners of company thinking it to be  ` snake'  - -\nthe trunk; the Managers  up against the landslide - - the belly;\nthe trade unionists  ` a tree'  - - the leg.\"  \n  \n\n \n\nThe concept of  participation in management was\nvery confusing and we are nonetheless wiser now !\n\n\nMohtras V. G. writing in  \" Labour Participation in\nManagement \"  in 1966 itself observed that participation means\n \" sharing of decision making power \"  by rank and\nfile of an industrial organisation through proper representations at all\nlevels of management in the entire range of managerial action.\n\n\nDecision making involves three steps: one should become aware of as\nmany alternatives as possible which are relevant to the decision, define each\nof these alternatives and, exercise choice.\n\n\nDecision making process on any level or sphere should have the scope\nof the views of everyone being considered, if there is participation.\n\n\nParticipation means  \" \" having a share take part\n\" , etc.\" \n\n\nThe managerial prerogatives should also be shared by everyone.\n\n\nIf the aim is that of Ian Clegg, then  \" it implies a\nsituation where  representatives, to some extent, are\ninvolved in the process of management decision making but where the ultimate\npower is in the hands of Management\"  .\n\n\nOn the other hand, if one has to follow Dr. Davis  \" it is a\nmental and emotional involvement of a person in a group situation which\nencourages him to contribute to goals and share responsibilities in them.\"\n\n\n\nIn Indian context  participation is to bridge the\ngap between management supremacy and  control by work place\nconsultation and joint consultation.\n\n\nThis can be illustrated as follows:  \n\n \n\nAs pointed out by Walker K.E in  \" \nParticipation in Management in practice - - An international perspective,\n\"  there are two basic ideas in the concept of  participation in management: two groups of people in an undertaking - -\nmanagers and workers - - and two separate sets of functions to be performed -\n- managerial and operative.\n\n\nManagerial functions are distinct from operative functions and are\ndivorced of operative functions, i.e.,  functions.\n\n\n participation is essentially aimed at meeting the\npsychological needs of workers at work.\n\n\nComte & Owen, in early days advocated the participation of workers in\nmanagement for achieving distributive social justice.\n\n\nKarl Marx advocated trade unionism and \nparticipation as an alternative for industrial self-government. \n\n \n\nOne of the references to  \" Sachar Committee\n\"  on Companies   and M.R.T.P. Acts, 1977, is to report the measures by which ( and\nat whether )  participation in the share capital and\nmanagement of the companies is to be brought about. \n\n \n\nIn the evidence given before the Committee, \" ASSOCHEM\n\" stated that labour should be given opportunity to participate\nmeaningfully in the ownership of capital as well as in decision making level,\nwhere the contribution would be meaningful and useful.\n\n\nBut \" FICCI \" argued that  \" it was not\nadvisable to rush through the legislation without properly preparing the way\nby ensuring that the concept of  participation is readily\nacceptable before introducing any Act  \"   .\n\n\nThe \" INTUC \" advocated the  \" labour are\nequal partners in the establishment and, therefore, should have equal\nrepresentation, with the shareholders on the board to ensure co-determination\nas is found in Germany\"  .\n\n\nThe \" ClTU \" averred that it is not possible so long\nas the primary motive oF production is an individual profit and also\nmaintained that no scheme of  participation can be\nsuccessfully implemented without changing the basic direction of economic\npolicies.\n\n\n\" CITU \" , however, demand that \nrepresentatives be given  ` equal status'  . \n\n \n\nThe  \" Sachar Committee \"  did not\nadequately answer the terms of reference like comparing with French Law where\nthere is some provision for setting apart a part of profit of the company.\n\n\nThe Committee was expected to go into the question oF incorporation\noF provisions required to be made to prevent mismanagement with reference to\nsafeguarding of  interests and the public interest.\n\n\nHowever, the Committee did make some drafting changes in the\nprovisions of the Companies Act and suggested some changes in the procedure\nand administrative machinery.\n\n\nThe Committee felt that their recommendations would mean meaningful\nparticipation by workers on the boards of companies.\n\n\nThe Committee recommended  participation at board\nlevel in companies with more than 1000 workmen ( as defined in the Industrial\nDisputes Act ) .\n\n\nThey also suggested consultations regarding the proportion of\nworker-directors.\n\n\nThe choice of worker director was to be only from amongst the workmen\nwith a tenure of 3 years.\n\n\nTo quote the  own word:  \" in order to\nensure effective participation by  representatives at the\nboard level section 292 ( of the Companies Act ) should be amended.\n\n\nWorker-director should not be barred from board meetings because of\nsection 299 / 380 of the Companies Act.\n\n\nFor proper performance, worker-directors should be given training in\ncommercial law, etc.\" \n\n\nThe Committee expressed the hope  \" that the participation of\nworkmen at the top management level in a company will lead to greater\nindustrial harmony <*> dotted line</*>\"  \n\n \n\nIn December 1983 the Government introduced a comprehensive scheme\non  participation in management, operating at the shop floor\nand plant levels.\n\n\nThe approach to Eighth Plan envisages to  base labour\nrelations to  participation and concern for productivity.\n\n\nIt is, perhaps, in this background, that the present Bill is\nintroduced.  \n\n\n  OBJECTS OF THE BILL  \n\n \n\nThe objects of the Bill are based on Article 43- a of the\nConstitution.\n\n\nIn the Statement of Objectives, it is stated,  \" the\nnon-statutory schemes have not been able to provide an effective framework\nfor a meaningful participation of workers in management at all levels\"\n .\n\n\nThe Bill is, therefore, aimed to  \" provide for specific and\nmeaningful participation of workers in management at shop floor level,\nestablishment level and board of management level\"  .\n\n\nThis would mean that at the shop floor level the elected person works\nas  \" manager\"  and becomes an addition to the existing\npersons and superceding even a supervisor!.\n\n\nPerhaps, what is intended is  \" specific and meaningful\nparticipation in management of workers at shop floor level <*> dotted\nline</*>\"  .\n\n\nIn Europe, where  representation on the board is\nquite common, the management structure follows the two-tier pattern initially\nevolved in Germany.\n\n\nEssentially, the system consists of a  ` management board'\n and  ` the advisory or supervisory board'  .\n\n\nThe management board consists of senior executives of the company\nexercising substantial managerial powers while the supervisory / advisory\nboard consists of workers.\n\n\nThe advantages of the two-tier board over a unitary board have been\nbroadly accepted by the western countries.\n\n\nThe  \" Sachar Committee \"  never favoured\nthe two tier board itself since it raises problems of demarcating precisely\nthe functions of two boards in the Indian context.\n\n\nThe Committee felt that introducing three formal layers of authority\nwith inevitable overlapping would not be conducive to efficiency and quick\ndecision making. \n\n \n\nManagement means skillful treatment and a manager is one \n\" who controls a business\"  .\n\n\nSection 2 ( 24 ) of the Companies Act defines  ` Manager'\n as  \" an individual who, subject to the supreintendence of\ncontrol and direction of the board of directors has the management of the\nwhole, or substantially the whole of the affairs of a company <*> dotted\nline</*>\"  . \n\n \n\nThe preamble of the Bill deals with  \" participation of\nworkers in the management of undertakings,  \" establishments\n\"  or other organisations engaged in any  industry \nand to provide for <*> dotted line</*>\"  . \n\n \n\nClause 2 ( k ) of the Bill states:  \" words and\nexpressions used but not defined in this Act and defined in the Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947 ( 14 of 1947 ) shall have the meanings respectively\nassigned to them in that Act\"  .\n\n\nThe term  ` establishment'  is covered by the Shops\nand Establishments Act and not by the Industrial Disputes Act.\n\n\nThe term industry has attracted a number of judicial decisions.\n\n\nSection 2 ( j ) of the Industrial Disputes Act reads as follows:\n \" industry means any business, trade, undertaking, manufacture or\ncalling of employees and includes any calling, service, employment,\nhandicraft or industrial occupation or avocation of workmen\"  .\n\n\n( The term  ` workmen'  is related to industry ) .\n\n\nThe word  ` undertaking'  means  \" anything\nundertaken or any business etc.\" \n\n\nThe widest ( wildest ! ) possible amplitude to the word  \"\nindustry\"  has been given by Krishna Iyer, J. ( and concurred in by\nothers ) in the seven judge bench of the Supreme Court in the famous case of\n \" Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board \"  [\n1978 Lab-lC 467 ( SC) ] . \n\n \n\nClause 2 ( e ) defines  ` other worker'  to mean a\nworker other than a workman, while clause 2 ( i ) defines worker as  \"\nany person employed in any industrial establishment to do any manual,\nunskilled, skilled, technical operational, clerical, supervisory, managerial\nor administrative work <*> dotted line</*>\" \n\n\nHowever,  ` workman'  is defined to mean any worker\nbut not a person employed in a managerial or administrative capacity; or a\nperson in but supervisory who draws wages exceeding Rs. 1600 per month <*>\ndotted line</*>  .\n\n\nSection 2 ( s ) of the Industrial Disputes Act while dealing with the\nword  \" workmen\"  has drawn a number of court cases including\nthe Supreme Court.\n\n\nUnlike the Industrial Disputes Act, a difference is sought to be\nbrought about between worker and workman in the Participation of Workers in\nManagement Bill.\n\n\nA workman may be a worker who is not a supervisor, manager, etc. but\na worker is a person employed in managerial capacity also.\n\n\nThe normal connotation of the word  ` workers'  is\n \" a person who works\"  (  \" Oxford Advanced\nLearners Dictionary \"  ) and a  ` workman'  is a\n \" man who earns a living by physical labour or at machines, etc. or\nperson who works in a specified way\"  .\n\n\nThe question that arises is - - why should there be another clause\nmentioning about  ` other worker'  when a worker is other than\na workman.\n\n\nThe whole definition seems to create more confusion even to a layman !\n\n\n \n\nClause 2 ( b ) defines  ` Board of Management' \nand the links to body corporate.\n\n\n ` Body corporate'  is defined under section 2 ( 7 )\nof the Companies Act.\n\n\nManagement of a company is always through a board.\n\n\nThe term  ` body corporate'  is much wider than an\nundertaking, industry or establishment. \n\n \n\nClauses 4 and 5 deal with shop councils, where \nrepresentative will be decided and the   \" modus\noperandi \"   of these councils.\n\n\nUnless IPC is taken cognizance of, workmen may not include workwomen !\n\n\n \n\nClause 6, which deals with  ` Board of Management'\n would simply mean that every board of management in any industrial\nestablishment shall have persons to represent workmen and other workers,\nsubject to certain percentage. \n\n \n\nClause 8 deals with  ` offences'  and fastens the\nresponsibility on the person  \" incharge of and responsible to the\ncompany for the conduct of business of the company\"  .\n\n\nThis would mean that the  \" worker\", \" other worker\" \nor  \" workman\"  representative in the board or at any other\nlevel is exempt, since they are only  \" representative persons\"\n and not  \" worker directors\"  though clause 6 ( 5 )\nmentions that the representative shall exercise the powers and discharge all\nthe functions of a member of the board of management and shallbe entitled to\nvote !\n\n\nAgain the question: that arises is - - will the definition of \n` Member'  under section 2 ( 27 ) of Companies Act apply ?\n\n\nUnder section 2 ( 27 ) of Companies Act, a member would mean a\nshareholder.\n\n\nIf a workman who is not a shareholder of a company can become a\nmember of the board of management, the provisions of the Companies Act may be\nviolated and, therefore, every company may have to change the articles of\nassociation with appurtinent consequences, particularly where some\nqualifications have been prescribed for directors. \n\n \n\nClause 13 lays down that the provisions of this Act shall have\neffect notwithstanding inconsistencies with other Acts.\n\n\nThis, perhaps takes, care of section 253, 256, 259, 260 or 263 of the\nCompanies Act.\n\n\nBut what about removal of a director ?\n\n\nPerhaps, the question will not arise, since the board of management\nhas only a representative with full powers of a director divested of\naccountability. \n\n \n\nClause 16 is the crux of the Bill.\n\n\nThis section states that section \n\n\n\n  3 of the Industrial Disputes Act\nwhich deals with works committees shall be omitted.\n\n\nThese committees are like the joint production committees in U.S.A.,\nRussia and Britain.\n\n\nThe object and purpose of these committees are three-fold - - ( a)\nvoluntary negotiation; ( b) mediation and conciliation; and ( c) arbitration\n/ adjudication.\n\n\nThe main function of these committees is to secure and preserve amity\nand good employer-employee relations.\n\n\nThey are concerned with normal day-to day working problems.\n\n\nBy the addition of clause 16 at the end of the Bill, it looks as\nthough the entire Bill is aimed at replacing these committees with a\nthree-tier committee.\n\n\nThis repeal runs contrary to the objects and reasons appended to the\nBill. \n\n \n\nViewed from all the above angles, it is clear that the\nrecommendations of Sachar Committee do not seem to have been taken into\nconsideration.\n\n\nThe terms and definitions in the Bill are bound to attract\nlitigations and judicial inferences.  <*> square </*>\n\n\n 1.  \" Eastern Economist \"  dated\n27. 8. 1976, p. 414.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6335ae60-e9fe-4b82-98cf-7d5247f42cfb", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.183602+00:00"}
{"text": "Think small  , think big     \n\n\n TOP OF THE WORLD, MICROSCOPICALLY SPEAKING \n\n \n\n  ON   April 22, scientists of\nthe Fermilab in the USA created, for the first time, a subatomic particle\ncalled Top, fulfilling a 30-year-old dream. \n\n \n\nAccording to the currently accepted theory of matter, quarks are\nthe basic building blocks of matter, making up certain subatomic particles,\nlike protons, neutrons and mesons.\n\n\nMost subatomic particles are built of five types of quarks - - Up,\nDown, Charm, Strange and Bottom.\n\n\nBut the prevalent theory requires the existence of the sixth quark,\nnamely \" Top \" . \n\n \n\nOne thing about \" Top \" is that it is heavy, much\nheavier than any other elementary particle, though scientist don't know why\nthis is so.\n\n\nFor this reason, Top could only be created by high energy collisions\nwhere energy gets converted into mass. \n\n \n\nIn April, \" Top \" was sighted in a collision of\nhigh energy beams of protons and electrons.\n\n\nIts measured mass - - 174 giga electron volts - - is 300,000 times\nheavier than an electron, and verifies the standard theory of matter. \n\n\n  NO MESSAGE IN BOTTLE  \n\n \n\n  THE   landscape of\ncommunications technology has been reworked in the last few years,\nparticularly in this country.\n\n\nOn October 15, with the successful launch of a remote sensing\nsatellite IRS-P2, India became the sixth nation in the world capable of\nlaunching payloads upto 1,000 kg.\n\n\nIt is also a potential contender in the multi-billion dollar launch\nservices market, dominated today by a select few. \n\n \n\nThis year also saw the establishment of an underwater\ninformation highway in the Indian ocean.\n\n\nSEA-ME--WE-2 ( South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe-2 ) ,\nthe  hongest optical fibre submarine cable ( 18.190 km long )\n, links India with 12 other countries, serving as much as one-third of the\n population.\n\n\nBy carrying international telephone calis, SEA-ME-WE-2 will\nease the burden of communication satellites   - - it can carry 60,000 simultaneous\nconversations ( without echoes or other disturbances), at transmission\ntimes of 20 milliseconds, compared to  500 milliseconds.\n\n\n \n\nThen, Motorola  Iridium project - - a global\nnetwork of 66 satellites to provide pocket-telephone service from\nanywhere to anywhere in the world - - is expected to start from 1998.\n\n\nThe satellites will be placed in low earth orbits ( 463 miles above\nthe surface of the earth, compared to the 22,300 miles at which a\ngeostationary satellite is found ) . \n\n \n\nThe Iridium project uses miscrowaves ( higher in frequency and\nshorter in wavelength than radio waves, microwaves can be concentrated into\ndirected beams more easily, making them more effective to locate objects )\nand an electronic component called the moriolithic microwave integrated\ncircuit ( MMIC), earlier developed for radar systems in missiles.\n\n\nMMICs installed in telephone handsets will receive the micro-wave\nsignals. \n\n\n  THINK SMALL - - AND DO BIG THINGS.  \n\n \n\n  SCIENTISTS   were thinking\nsmall as never before this year, all with an idea of doing big things.\n\n\nNanotechnology means making things in dimensions comparable to\nthose of atoms and molecules (  less than a billionth of a\nmetre ) to harvest the properties of such small atomic clusters. \n\n \n\nMetallurgists find that making alloys with metal powders\nhaving nano-sized particles will make the alloy extremely strong.\n\n\nVanes of turbojet generators, walls of the containers housing\nfuel rods in a nuclear reactor, material for bullet-proof vests - - all\nthese need to have extremely high mechanical strength.\n\n\nIn the field of electronics, nanotechnology promises to further\nshrink computers. \n\n \n\nNanomachine builders ultimately aim to make the machines\nmake themselves - - growing piece by piece, starting from their molecular\ncomponents,   into mammoth machines like earth movers, drawing component parts from\na molecular soup.\n\n\nNo,  not just fiction.\n\n\nA chemist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US\nhas been able to design a molecule which can reproduce itself in this way.\n\n\n \n\nNanomachines can help save lives.\n\n\nSurgeons will soon be able to insert tiny machines into the body for\ndiagnostic purposes - - like inserting tiny cameras inside the chest\nwithout making large incisions - - reducing, for example, standard operation\nincision sizes from 25 cm to just three cm. \n\n \n\nOf course, for such precision work the surgeon will need a robot.\n\n\nRobodoc awaits approval for general distribution by the US Food and\nDrug Administration.\n\n\nIts very first assignment will be at a hip transplant operation,\nwhere it will carve out a hole int he thigh bone, aided by a computer and do\nthe job 10 times more accurately than a regular human would. \n\n\n  PLAYING WITH GENES  \n\n \n\n  AMONG   the new\napplications of biotechnology reported this year, the most important for\nus is perhaps the one which explains how malaria parasites actually get into\nblood cells. \n\n \n\nResearches from The National Institute of Allergy and\nInfectious Diseases in the UK used genetic engineering to identify the\nmodus operandi of the parasite - - how and to what part of the cells\nsurface it binds.\n\n\nThis opens up the possibility of synthesising or genetically\nengineering an antibody ( antibodies protect against harmful viruses and\nbacterial ) in such a size and shape to keep the parasites out of the cell.\n\n\n \n\nAnother attractive fallout of genetic engineering is the\npossibility of using genetically engineered plants, instead of\nanimals, to make antibodies.\n\n\nThis would make available inexpen,l>sive antibodies, in large\nquantities, for use in medicine, pollution control and industrial\nprocessing ( aquatic plants could be engineered to produce antibodies\nthat extract pollutants such as heavy metals from industrial effluents ) .\n\n\n\n   \" MADE IN SPACE\"   \n\n \n\n  MARCH   saw the release of a\nfinal design for a Space Station jointly run by the European Space Agency,\nthe USA, Japan, Canada and Russia.\n\n\nThe largest international research and development project ever\nundertaken will cost about 30 billion dollars. \n\n \n\nThe Space Station, whose construction is meant to start in\n1997, will accommodate six crew members when completed, in 2002.\n\n\nThe 376 metric tonnes include six laboratory modules.\n\n\nThe abundance of solar energy will meet all energy requirements.\n\n\n \n\nSpace is known to be ideal for processing materials - - high\nquality crystals can be grown there, as gravity-induced effects are neglible.\n\n\nMetals and alloys can be processed without the use of a container,\nthrough magnetic suspension - - by floating them inside\ncurrent-carrying coils - - and doing away with contamination.\n\n\nWithout gravity pulling them down, molten substances can be held\nin place by weak magnetic fileds.\n\n\nBiological samples can be separated into their components using\nelectric fields to yield pure samples. \n\n \n\nThe Space Station is the first step to the setting up of space\nfactories.\n\n\nIn the near future,  \" Made in Space\"  may become\ncommon labels on products we use on terra firma.   \n\n\n  ZAPPING CANCER WITH A CURRENT  \n\n \n\n  IN   cancer treatment, new\ntechniques are emerging, to selectively destroy cancerous cells without\ndamaging healthy cells, a significant hazard in conventional chemotherapy\nand radiation treatments.\n\n\nIn the forefront of such methods is electrochemotherapy, or ECT,\nwhich is especially convenient for tumours in the brain and neck regions.\n\n\nECT combines an electric field and chemotherapeutic agents, to\nincrease the uptake of drugs by tumour cells. \n\n \n\nThe plasma membrane of a cell which forms its outer wall does not\nnormally allow external molecules to enter into the cell.\n\n\nECT works by sending a short-lived, high-intensity electric pulse to\nthe tumour site.\n\n\nThe plasma membranes of the target cells temporarily collapses,\npores form on its surface, allowing the drug to pass through.\n\n\nWhen the current is stopped, the pores reseal and regain their\noriginal form.\n\n\nECT ensures that the drug enters only tumorous cells, reducing the\nunwanted effects of chemotherapy. \n\n\n  TINY CHEMICAL PLANTS  \n\n \n\n   ZEOLITE   \nmeans  ` a boiling stone'  in Greek.\n\n\nIt was named so by a Swedish mineralogist who found that this curious\ncompound bubbled and appeared to boil when heated.\n\n\nActually, it was nothing but water escaping from the\ninnumerable pores present in its tiny crystals.\n\n\nThese solids can hold an enormous amount of water in the millions of\nmolecularsized channels they contain.\n\n\nIf all the channels in a teaspoon of  zeolite \ncrystal were opened up, and laid side by side, they would cover a football\nfield! \n\n \n\nBecause of their porosity and other unusual properties,\nzeolites are finding many uses.\n\n\nThey have the twin ability to work as molecular sieves and then\ntrigger chemical reactions.\n\n\nThe large surface area on their hollow surfaces allows many chemical\nreactions to occur at least 50 times more efficiently than otherwise. \n\n \n\nSynthesised zeolites are being used extensively by chemists as\nchemical plants.\n\n\nFor example, cadmium sulphide superclusters, made by first\ninjecting cadmium ions and then hydrogen sulphide gas into zeolite pores,\nhave potential applications as optical switches ( they are opaque or\ntransparent depending on how much light shines on them ) and are found to\nwork much faster than cadmium sulphide made from conventional routes.\n\n\n \n\nSome other things being made by these tiny chemical plants;\noptical memories based on tiny crystals of a light-sensitive material\ncreated within a zeolite; chemical sensors consisting of a thin layer of\nzeolite crystals; molecular sized filaments of conducting polymers <*>\ndotted line</*>  <*> overlapping diamonds red & black </*> \n\n \n\n\n  Sands of destruction     \n\n \n\n MY  textbook perception of deserts as barren,\nlifeless worlds was shattered some years ago, while on a filming project in\nthe Thar-Deserts.\n\n\nI discovered, abounded with life, especially around oases.\n\n\nThere were plants, birds and other wildlife.\n\n\nIn a single day, I sighted 40 kinds of birds, including vast\ncongregations of cranes. \n\n \n\nNow, that was a real, natural desert.\n\n\nThe term  \" desert\"  implies a dry, barren, treeless,\nusually sandy, water-starved region.\n\n\nBut the desert is just one more type of habitat on earth, with its\nown wildlife, beautifully adapted for the rigors of desert life. \n\n \n\nNearly one-third of the  surface is desert or\nsemi-desert.\n\n\nThis arid and semi-arid part of the world is home for more than 750\nmillion people. \n\n \n\nNatural deserts, spread over five of the seven continents, are no\ncause for concern.\n\n\nIt is true that some present-day desert regions were once fertile\nlands.\n\n\nCenturies of over-use turned regions like Mesopotamia, often\ndescribed as the cradle of civilisation into desert.\n\n\nBut what is more disturbing right now is the 12 to 20 million\nhectares  being desertified. \n\n \n\nThough desertification is evident all over the world, it is\nmost conspicuous in Africa.\n\n\nIn Asia, nearly 40 per cent of the land is at a high risk of being\ndesertified.\n\n\nLikewise, considerable stretches of land in Australia and the eastern\nUS are also fast deteriorating.  \n\n \n\nDesertisation is not the same as desertification.\n\n\nWhile the latter is the result of human activity, desertisation is\nthe natural spread of desert and desert-like habitats - - a very slow\nprocess.\n\n\nThe threat we face today is of desertification. \n\n \n\nThe issue of desertification was brought into international focus\nby the Sahel disaster of the early 1970s.\n\n\nBut the dimension of the problem was not fully realised at the\ntime.\n\n\nRecent estimates indicate that nearly 70 million hectares of Africa,\nsouth of the Sahara, have been desertified. \n\n \n\nThe Indian scenario is not much better.\n\n\nNearly 12 per cent of the  geographical area is\ndesert, mostly in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and parts of Punjab.\n\n\nThen there are the cold high-altitude deserts of Ladakh and northern\nHimachal Pradesh.\n\n\nIndian deserts are biologically rich though they lie in the zone of\nlowest pressure in the monsoons.\n\n\nSome 600 species of plants, 50 species of mammals and over 100\nspecies of birds are to be found here.\n\n\nIndian deserts are also zones of immense economic value.\n\n\nThey are the most populated deserts in the world. \n\n \n\n desert regions are home to nearly 20 million\npeople with a population densi,l>ty of 61 people/sq km: most other desert\nregions have a density of about 4-5 people/sq km.\n\n\nWorse still, there are 22 million cattle, sheep and goats grazing\nand browsing in Indian deserts.\n\n\nThus, man and beast are gnawing away into a fragile world,\ndegrading the miles of land surrounding these regions.\n\n\nIt is officially estimated that over 50 per cent of the  total area is in some state of degradation. \n\n \n\nThe reasons for desertification are directly connected to\nhuman activities.\n\n\nWe have over-cultivated traditionally poor soil and have let\nlivestock run havoc on land that was not geared to face this onslaught; we\nhave robbed our planet of nearly half its forests, including those in\ncritical upland watershed regions.\n\n\nOur improper irrigation practices have caused excessive\nsalinisation and alkalisation of soil, making it useless for\nagricultural use and leading to desertification.\n\n\nDevelopmental schemes devised to bring in more water are beginning\nto backfire - - the desert ecology is not geared to absorb a flood of water.\n\n\n \n\nThe objectives of desert-related projects have been soil and\nwater management, management of pastoral communities and raising livestock\nproductivity levels. \n\n \n\nIt has to be acknowledged that a judicious management of water (\nand soil ) will be the key to  \" prosperity\"  in the  deserts.\n\n\nThis does not mean the creation of water-choked labyrinths of canals\nbut the preservation of the origional, natural habitats, with their own\nplant and animal communities, and a rational use of the surrounding lands,\nwhich are most susceptible to becoming the lifeless, desolate places we\nall think deserts are.  <*> overlapping diamonds, red & black</*>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "43276f84-6bfb-4b17-855d-86fd9d6fce3d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.185130+00:00"}

Synthetics\nLtd., Kanpur.\n\n \n\n  THE   Life Insurance\nCorporation of  Group Superannuation Scheme is an instrument\nfor providing annuity to the employees or their dependants at the time of\nsuperannuation, retirement or death, as the case may be.\n\n\nThe annuity is paid from the moneys contributed by the employer to the\nfund during the service span of an employee.\n\n\nMost of the well reputed companies in India have their own approved\nsuperannuation fund, and the sums contributed to the fund, on behalf of\nemployees, together with accumulated interest, are utilised for purchasing an\nannuity from \" LIC \" , at the time of retirement or death of\neach employee.\n\n\nThe main object of creating a superannuation fund is to provide for a\nregular income in the form of annuity to the employees after their retirement\nfrom the service. \n\n \n\nVarious annuity plans of \" LIC \" have come up for\ncriticism as the annuity paid to the employees at the time of superannuation,\nretirement, as the case may be, is so meagre and inadequate that such amount\npaid work out to a bare 11 per cent interest on the total corpus accumulated\nfrom the sums contributed by the employer.\n\n\nThe \" LIC \" , by taking advantage of mandatory\nprovisions of rules 89 and 91 of the Income-tax Rules, which allows\ncommutation of annuity to the extent of one third, where an employee receives\ngratuity, and one half in other cases, appropriates, the balance amount,\ni.e., 66.66 per cent or 50 per cent, as the case may be.\n\n\nMoreover, the annuity paid to the employees also ceases after a\nspecified guaranteed period.\n\n\nIf the employers are allowed to create their own funds and invest\nsimilar amount in safe securities like \" NSS, \" \"\nNSC, \" bank deposits, \" UTI \" , etc., the principal\namount is not only secured but the return on investment in such securities\nwould be far higher than what is offered under the annuity plans of \"\nLIC \" . \n\n \n\nThe LIC has recently introduced a new annuity plan to overcome\nmany of the shortcomings of its earlier annuity plans.\n\n\nThe new annuity plan provides for return of capital to the nominee /\nbeneficiary of the employee at the time of death.\n\n\nThis provision was not there in its earlier schemes.\n\n\nAn attempt has been made in this article to compare the benefits\noffered under the new annuity plan which guarantees payment of annuity for a\nspecified period and life thereafter with other annuity plans.\n\n\nA comparison has also been made on the rate of return on sums\ninvested in the new annuity plan and  \" ` Jeevan Dhara'\n\"  , as it is felt that such comparison would be more\nmeaningful as both are deferred annuity schemes administered by \" LIC\n\" .\n\n\nMoreover, the contribution under  \" ` Jeevan Dhara'\n\"  would qualify for deduction upto Rs. 40,000 from the\ngross income of an employee under section 80 CCA of the Income-tax Act. \n\n\n SUPERANNUATION FUND \n\n \n\nThe objective of the superannuation fund is to provide for\nannuity to the employees and their dependants on superannuation, death or\nretirement as the case may be.\n\n\nThe sums contributed by the employers to the fund, during the service\ntenure of the employee, gets accumulated together with interest and is\nutilised by LIC for purchasing an annuity policy.\n\n\nAny other investments, other than Group Superannuation Scheme of\n\" LIC \" , would not receive the approval of the Commissioner\nof Income tax, and will also not qualify for deduction on business\nexpenditure under section 36 of the Income-tax Act. \n\n \n\nThe mandatory provisions of rule 89 of the Income-tax Rules make\nit obligatory for an employer to constitute a trust for payment of annuity\nby:\n\n\n(  1  ) entering into a scheme with \" LIC\n\" established under the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 ( 32 of ]\n956 ) ; or\n\n\n(  2  ) accumulate the contribution in respect of each\nbeneficiary / nominee and purchase an annuity from \" LIC \"\nat the time of retirement or death of each employee. \n\n \n\nRule 90 of the Income-tax Rules, 1962, allows for commutation of\nannuity, provided such commutation of annuity does not exceed: ( a) in case\nwhere an employee receives any gratuity, the commuted value of one-third of\nthe annuity which is normally entitled to receive; and ( b) in any other\ncase, the commuted value of one-half of such annuity. \n\n \n\nSuch commuted value of annuity being determined having regard to\nthe age of the recipient, the state of his health, the rate of interest and\nofficially recognised tables of mortality.\n\n\nThe commuted value of annuity, as specified in rule 90, is exempt\nfrom the income tax, and only payment of annuity made to the employee or his\ndependants are treated as salary income for the purposes of tax. \n\n \n\nThe Life Insurance Corporation of India offers two types of\nsuperannuation plans: \n\n\n 1.  Money purchase scheme  \n\n \n\nThe rate of contribution payable by the employers in respect of\nits employees it decided in advance in relation to his salary.\n\n\nAs per the present provision of the Income tax Rules, such rate of\ncontribution cannot exceed 15 per cent of the salary, if the  contribution to provident fund is equivalent to 10 per cent of the  salary.\n\n\nThe total contribution made by an employer towards superannuation and\nrecognised provident fund cannot exceed 25 per cent of the  salary.\n\n\nThe contribution made by the employer is utilised by \" LIC\n\" to secure appropriate pension. \n\n\n 2.  Benefit purchase scheme  \n\n \n\nThe amount of annuity is invested by the employer in advance  in relation to the salary by an employee in the year\nof retirement or the average salary drawn in the last 3 or 5 years, prior to\nretirement.\n\n\nFor example, 2 per cent of the annual salary for each year of\nservice, subject to a maximum of 60 per cent of the salary.\n\n\nLIC will determine the premium payable with respect to the employees.\n\n\n \n\nThe employee has also the option to elect any one of the\nfollowing types of annuities:\n\n\n(  1  ) Annuity payable throughout his life time;\n\n\n(  2  )\n\n\nAnnuity payable during his life time, but also guaranteed for a\nspecific minimum number of years ( 5, 10 & 15 years ) .\n\n\nIf he dies during the guaranteed period, the annuity will continue to\nbe paid to his beneficiary for remaining part of the period;\n\n\n(  3  ) Annuity is payable throughout his life time\nwith death benefit equivalent to purchase price along with \" GPT\n\" Bonus;\n\n\n(  4  )\n\n\nAnnuity payable during the joint life time of the employee and his\nwife, and continue thereafter during the life time of the survival: and\n\n\n(  5  )\n\n\nIn the event of cessation of service or death of a member while in\nservice, prior to superannuation age, the moneys standing to the credit of\nthe employee would be utilised to provide pension to him or to his\nbeneficiary, as the case maybe. \n\n\n  JEEVAN DHARA  \n\n \n\nThe Life Insurance Corporation of India introduced a new\nfinancial instrument known as   \" \" Jeevan Dhara\"\n\"   for ensuring regular payment of annuity to persons\nat the time of their retirement.\n\n\n\" Jeevan Dhara \" offers the following additional\nbenefits:\n\n\n- - Attractive annuity rates;\n\n\n- - Enhancement of   ` GIVE'   ( Gross\nInsurance Value Element) at the time of verifying by way of bonus which\ncorrespondingly increases the annuity; and\n\n\n- - On death after annuity payment commences, enhanced  GIVE\n with an additional lump sum bonus is payable to the heirs. \n\n\n  COMPARATIVE STUDY  \n\n \n\nFor the purposes of this study, the rate of return under the  new annuity plan has been compared with  annuity plan guaranteed for 15 years certain and life\nthereafter and \" Jeevan Dhara \" . \n\n\n  ASSUMPTIONS  \n\n \n\nThe following assumptions are made for the purposes of comparing\nthe rate of return under the Group Superannuation Scheme and \" Jeevan\nDhara \" :\n\n\n( a) The normal date of retirement has been taken as 55 years in both\nGroup Superannuation Scheme and \" Jeevan Dhara \" .\n\n\nThe rate of contribution, which is limited to 15 per cent of the  annual salary as provided in Rule 88 of the Income-tax Rules,\nhave been pre-determined till the age of retirement of an employee;\n\n\n( b) An employee receives gratuity at the time of his retirement; and\n\n\n( c) An employee commutes his/her annuity at the time of retirement,\nas such commutation is not subject to income-tax. \n\n\n  NEW ANNUITY PLAN v. ANNUITY GUARANTEED FOR 15 YEARS\nCERTAIN AND LIFE THEREAFTER  \n\n \n\nIt will be seen from the table  ( published on page 946 )\n that an employee entering the scheme at the age of 25 years on a salary\nof Rs. 6000 per month, the cash accumulation under the 15 years scheme, on\ncontribution remitted @ 15 per cent of salary for a deferment period of 30\nyears would be Rs. 20,86,492.\n\n\nThe employee would also be eligible to commute one-third of the cash\naccumulation standing to his credit at the time of retirement.\n\n\nThe annuity payable, if an employee commutes one-third of his\nannuity, would be Rs. 13,395 per month guaranteed for a period of 15 years\nand life thereafter.\n\n\nHowever, if an employee dies, say, at the age of 65 years, his / her\nbeneficiary / nominee would receive annuity only for the balance period of 5\nyears under this plan, and thereafter, the payment of annuity will cease.\n\n\nThus, the sums receivable in the event of death of an employee would\nwork out to Rs. 14,99,197 ( annuity of Rs. 8,03,700 calculated @ Rs. 13,395\nper month for the balance period of 5 years plus commuted value of annuity\namounting to Rs. 6,95,497.\n\n\nIn other words, under the scheme, \" LIC \" would be\nappropriating Rs. 5,87,395 otherwise would have been legally payable to the\nnominee / beneficiary of the employee.\n\n\nAt all age and income levels, there is a loss of capital amounting to\n lacs  of rupees under this plan. \n\n \n\nIn the new annuity plan, the sums receivable in the event of\ndeath of an employee would be Rs. 13,90,995, if an employee commutes his\nannuity at the time of retirement.\n\n\nThe total sums receivable on account of commutation of annuity and\nthe sums receivable by the legal heirs would be Rs. 20,86,492 as against Rs.\n6,95,497 ( commuted value of annuity) offered under the 15 years scheme.\n\n\nThere is, thus, a net gain of Rs. 13,90,995 in the new annuity plan.\n\n\nIt will be seen from the table that for all age and income levels,\nthe sum receivable under the new plan is higher compared to the annuity plan\nguaranteed for 15 years certain and life thereafter.\n\n\nThis is primarily because of the provision of full return of capital\nunder the new annuity plan.\n\n\nIn the annuity plan for 15 years certain and life thereafter, 66.66\nper cent or 50 per cent of the capital, as the case may be, is appropriated\nby \" LIC \" by virtue of mandatory provisions of rules 89 and\n91 of the Income tax Rules. \n\n \n\nIn the example quoted above, the annuity payable under the new\nplan would be Rs. 12,096 per month as against Rs. 13,395 per month in 15\nyears plan, i.e., a net loss of annuity amounting to Rs. 1299 per month.\n\n\nAlthough, lot of important features have been introduced under the\nnew annuity plan like return of capital with terminal bonus in the event of\ndeath of an employee, there appears to be a considerable reduction in the\nmatter of payment of annuity to the employees as compared to the 15 years\nguaranteed scheme. \n\n\n  NEW ANNUITY PLAN v JEEVAN DHARA  \n\n \n\nThe rate of return on sums invested in  \" Jeevan\nDhara \"  is comparatively higher to the return offered under\nthe new annuity plan.\n\n\nFor example, for an employee entering the scheme at the age of 25 on\na salary of Rs. 6,000 per month, the payment of annuity at the end of\ndeferment period in \" Jeevan Dhara \" would be Rs. 22,686 per\nmonth as against Rs. 19,051 per month ( annuity plus interest on commuted\nvalue of annuity ) under the new annuity plan; a net gain of Rs. 3,635 per\nmonth in \" Jeevan Dhara \"  policy.\n\n\nSimilarly, the sums receivable by the nominee / beneficiary in the\nevent of death of an employee under \" Jeevan Dhara \" would\nbe Rs. 22,68,611 as against Rs. 20,86,492 under the new annuity plan: a net\ngain of Rs. 1,81,690.\n\n\nIt will be seen from the table that for all age and income levels,\nthe sums receivable under the new plan is much less compared to \"\nJeevan Dhara \" .\n\n\nSimilarly, there is also a reduction in the payment of annuity for\nall age and income levels, as compared to annuity offered under \"\nJeevan Dhara \" .\n\n\nThe only drawback in the \" Jeevan Dhara \" policy is\nthat there is no provision for commutation of annuity, which is available in\nthe new annuity plan.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4255a8bf-f558-4768-b3dc-9377d8782af2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.186345+00:00"}

to.\n\n\nWasn't it enough that he should be there, his presence wafting\ntowards her like a soft breeze from across the room?\n\n\nShe could not see his eyes.\n\n\nThis time it was his voice which filled her body and mingled with her\ntears. \n\n \n\n \" Shreya, Shreya, Shreya,\"  he repeated her name\nsoftly.\n\n\nIt was like an averment that yearned its way to her from that\ndistance.\n\n\nHe

\n\n\n \n\n \" Shreya.\"  \n\n \n\nHe came and stood near her.\n\n\nShe looked at him, the tears flowing onto her full, blood red lips.\n\n\nthe stillness between them was like the flames of the ritual\n havan  or fire which sear the worshipping bodies arranged\naround it.  \n\n\nShreya felt her body dissolving into those flames and again, once\nagain, the incense rose from her pores and enveloped her as she looked at\nhim through that aromatic haze.\n\n\nHer lips rose to his, his breath must smell like roses, she thought,\nit must smell like roses <*> dotted line</*>\n\n\nIt did, it did. \n\n \n\nThe telephone screeched through the stillness like a\nmurdering shriek in the night.\n\n\nIt was Brijesh.\n\n\nCold, matter of fact, his voice as blank as his eyes, informing her\nthat he would not be home for dinner. \n\n \n\n \" Come with me,\"  said Anand. \n\n \n\n \" Yes.\"  \n\n \n\nAnand had not brought his driver or the escort who normally\naccompanies the Deputy Commissioner and District Magistrate wherever he\ntravels in his district.\n\n\nThe D.C. in his town is like a minister in a state capital, easly\nrecognizable, the object of constant gossip and speculation whose\nprivate life and personal habits are like the ingredients for a heady\ncocktail which are mixed, shaken and drunk by an eager populace.\n\n\nWhile held in awe for the supreme authority he wields, he is\ntotally vulnerable to the machinations of local political bosses who, if he\nis too strict and unresponsive to their personal recommendattions, start\nnibbling away at his reputation to the point of causing such\nbureaucratic embarrassment that he has to be transferred out.\n\n\nIn the final analysis the politician emerges, as the winner, even if\nit is at the cost of the implementation of his own declared public\npolicies.\n\n\nThe Indian Administrative Service cadre has an in-built security\nsystem provided in the constitution however that gives it a staying power and\nresilence which cannot be destroyed.\n\n\nOnly harrassment can weaken its will or dilute its idealism, never\nthe prospect of dismissal. \n\n \n\nShreya had been in Lucknow long enough and also been active\nenough to perceive that    <&> in column one in the\nmidddle tantalizer 2 \n\n\nAnand was known to temper his Independence of spirit, his zest for\nefficiency and resistance to political manoeuvrebilities with a\nsobriety and understanding that had ensured him the good will, if not the\ncompliance of his subordinates and a certain degree of cooperation from\nthe politicians.\n\n\nShe had gleaned this from the stray comments she heard, and of\ncourse, from the unity of reaction both of the underpriviledged class like\nthe servants and those right up the ladder who were close to the chief\nminister whom she had seen on occasions looking at Anand with seasoned\nopproval.\n\n\nPerhaps this  was because\nthe chief minister in U.P. was also, like Anand, a Brahmin.\n\n\nHari Prasad Trivedi was only in his forties but not above extracting\nhis dose of conventional obeisance.\n\n\nBoth temporal power and a sense of Brahmanical superiority\ncombined in him to produce an attitude of mind which expected young and\nold to touch his feet as a routine gesture.\n\n\nAnd they did, thrusting their hands down to the ground just above his\nfeet when he was standing and bending low over his knees if he were\nsitting.\n\n\nSometimes she would see him push his foot forward almost\ninvoluntarily as soon as someone came near him, so habituated was he to this\npractice and so confident in his expectation of this act of reverent\ngenuflexion from his worshipping subjects which included even officers\nbelonging to the state service. \n\n \n\nShreya saw that Anand maiantained his official aloofness as a\nmember of the privileged Indian Administrative Service or perhaps took\nshelter behind it.\n\n\nHe reminded her a litle of her father.\n\n\nThere was the same arrogant tilt of the head and at times the same\nmilish refusal to budge from a stand taken in full faith against political\ninterference or pressure.\n\n\nHis rapport with the people gave additi nal credibility to his\nposition.\n\n\nThe thought that he could even be posted away as a punishment\ntherefore had never occurred to Shreya.\n\n\nNor did she have the apprehension that if she were to be seen\nalone in his house in the evening it would lead to a scandal and that his\nimage would suffer as a consequence.\n\n\nIt was she who was also vulnerable.\n\n\nBut she didnot think of that either.\n\n\nShe did not feel married.\n\n\nShe felt untouched, pure, virginal.\n\n\nShe did not feel she was going to  house alone as a\nmarried woman, the wife of Brijesh with the blank eyes.\n\n\nShe felt she was going as Shreya, virgin and free, even if she had a\nhusband and three children.\n\n\nHer body was afire without her knowing why. \n\n \n\nLater, she shook with gusts of awareness, again and again, the\nwind ripping through the defending branches of her body and leaving her bare,\nborn anew, a beloved.\n\n\nEach time at the mere thought of what was happening to her body would\nripple like the suddenly excited waters of a tranquil pond.\n\n\nShe would feel the tremors running like spirits all through her\nveins.\n\n\nShe could not believe that the face she saw above hers as she lay on\nhis bed was actually his and that, at last, no shadows lay between.\n\n\nThey were one, the smells and the sounds of a dream, and the reality\nthat pierced her with the black of its burning eyes.\n\n\nShe could no longer distinguish between the fires that flamed in\nher heart and the fires that leapt in her limbs.\n\n\nWas this love, or whatever it was?\n\n\nShe did not know.\n\n\nShreya could not think. \n\n \n\nShe could only react to the winds that ripped through, the\nwaters that rippled, the tremors that shook her.\n\n\nShe was like a person who had been dosed with slow poison, numbed\ninto lethargy and the gradual demoralisation of the senses and was now\ncaught in violent seizures that tore her from her reserves.\n\n\nHer eyes flew wide open, her mouth, her legs, her heart, were opened\nto receive, each pore an open receptacle for the showers of ecstasy that\nrained down upon her. \n\n \n\n \" Shreya, Shreya, my darling.\n\n\n got to go.\n\n\nI have to drop you home.\"  \n\n \n\nShe had fallen asleep.\n\n\nFor the first time in the arms of a man.\n\n\nNever once in all those years with Brijest had this happened\ndespite his earnest and persistent efforts.\n\n\nPoor kind, brown eyed husband, thought Shreya, drowsily.\n\n\nNever to have known this fever, never to have been loved.\n\n\nPoor brown eyes, poor, kind Brijesh.\n\n\nPoor Brijesh, poor Brijesh, poor Brijesh <*> dotted line</*> hunched\nin shoulders shrunk over indeterminate breasts, no, no, that was her, not\nhim, she, with her disused nipples which were now pushing their way into her\nconsciousness.\n\n\nPoor Brijesh, poor husband with no nipples but a persistent cock\nthat crowed and crowed in vain <*> dotted line</*>\n\n\nShe sat up in a panic.\n\n\nShe couldn't face him.\n\n\nWhat would she say?\n\n\nShe was drenched in ecstasy, it was spilled all over her, it would\nbe there with its heavy monsoon shower from him to see, see that she was not\nthe same as before.\n\n\nShe clung to Anand in panic.\n\n\nI can't, I don't want to, I can't <*> dotted line</*> go with\nanother face, I can't.\n\n\nPlease. \n\n \n\nBrijesh was not at home when Anand dropped her.\n\n\nShe went and flung herself on her bed, her first and permanent\nrefuge, then burrowed into it, hiding from herself, from him, from that\n<*> dotted line</*>\n\n\nBut the more she snuggled into herself the more conscious did she\nbecome of that other and soon the incense began to rise from her body, rising\nand enveloping her and sucking her into its sensusous cloud.\n\n\nBrijesh found her like that.\n\n\nShe looked so ready, so pliable, in a daze, so warm <*> dotted\nline</*> the Shreya of his dreams, in a drunken daze, so full of her own\necstasy that no cries of her old protests came to her when he slid in with\nher and into her and she swam again and again with him in a sea of\nreceptivity.\n\n\nOh Shreya, oh Shreya, oh Shreya, the voice of her husband cried over\nthe sea of faces that mingled in her eyes and the gentle waves that lapped\nover her.\n\n\nThere was nothing except the sea in her body and all of the secrets\nof its heady movements opening up to her.\n\n\nShreya, Shreya, she heard her    voice\nwhisper in wondering delight and slowly as the waves receded, without a\nward, a murmur, a protest, Shreya sank into sleep. \n\n \n\nShe hated him when she woke up the next morning and found him\nlooking at her with the milky tenderness in his eyes.\n\n\nShe was appalled of what had happened.\n\n\nShe had never felt with Anand that she had betrayed her marriage.\n\n\nShe felt now with her husband that she had betrayed her love or\nwhatever that was.\n\n\nIt should have been the other way round.\n\n\nThe hate in her was like rapids in her bloodstream, jostling,\ncrashing, tumbling and running for outlets.\n\n\nShe shut her yes so that he should not see the hate in them.\n\n\nHer head swam in a haze of moral confusion.\n\n\nWhat was right?\n\n\nWhat was wrong?\n\n\nWhat had she done?\n\n\nWhat had happened to her?\n\n\nIf he touches me,  scream.\n\n\nShe slipped a veil of blankness over her eyes when she looked back\nat him. \n\n \n\n \" Shreya <*> dotted line</*>\"  he hesitated.\n\n\n \n\nI hate him, she thought.\n\n\nHe had no business to defile me with this, with his gentleness.\n\n\n always doing that.\n\n\nDefiling me with that gentle brown in his eyes.\n\n\nHe was standing still, in front of her, his arms hanging straight\ndown on either side.\n\n\nHe was not going to move towards her.\n\n\nHe was still and quiet and helpless in his desire for her\nresponse.\n\n\nAnd patient.\n\n\nAnd glowing. \n\n \n\n \" Shreya, you were <*> dotted line</*> so kind to me\nlast night.\n\n\nTo us,\"  he added softly. \n\n \n\nShe felt sick.\n\n\nThe red in her cheeks flared up to match her lips.\n\n\nShe turned her face away.\n\n\nWhat had she done!   what had he\ndone?\n\n\nUsed her.\n\n\nFound her ready and warm with Anand, oh Anand - - and used her with\nhis horrible gentleness.\n\n\nI hate him.\n\n\nI hate him.\n\n\nI hate him.\n\n\nShe kept quiet, with her head lowered demurely in front of him.\n\n\nI - I have become like her, she thought fearfully.\n\n\nLike Zahida, the prostitute, with her many men.\n\n\nWhat have I done?\n\n\nShe who had no desires, only vague stirrings, she, who didn't even\nknow what love was, she, who was so normal, so ordinary that nothing\nextraordinary could be accommodated in the routine grooves of her mind.\n\n\nWhat have I done?\n\n\nWhat has happened to me?\n\n\nNo, it was not Brijesh, her husband, not the man with the kind,\nbrown eyes.\n\n\nNo, I can't hate him.\n\n\nIt is him, with the incense and the black in his eyes.\n\n\nIt was the incense, it was him, it was the black in those eyes; her\nheart kept pounding this refrain beneath her hunched in breasts and her\nlowered lids.\n\n\nIt is he who has done this, he, Anand, not this kind man with his\ngentle, brown

{"text": "HEALTH & FITNESS  \n\n\n  CONTRACEPTIVES       \n\n \n\n  THE    oldest\nknown contraceptive is an ancient Egyptian pessary described in the \n Petri Papyrus   in 1850 BC.\n\n\nIt was made of crocodile manure and was a fairly effective spermicide.\n\n\nSince time immemorial human society has felt the need for curbing its\ngrowth and this has led to the development of various contraceptive methods.\n\n\nIn a lighter vein contraception means \" copulation without\npopulation \" .\n\n\nFor centuries, people practised various contraceptive measures such\nas coitus interruptus, safe periods, abstinence, etc.\n\n\nBut it was only in the last few decades that contraceptive technology\nwas revolutionized by the introduction of intra uterine contraceptive\ndevices ( IUCD) and oral contraceptive ( OC) pills.\n\n\nFor more details on the history of contraception, see \"\nSCIENCE TODAY \" , June 1987, p.54. \n\n \n\nContraception is the prevention of conception.\n\n\nSome 30 years ago the introduction of birth-control pills and\nimproved IUDs produced a virtual revolution in contraceptive\ntechnology.\n\n\nFor the first time in the history of human reproduction,\ncontraceptive methods which were comparatively easy and convenient to use,\nreversible, effective and relatively free from major health risks became\navailable, giving women almost total control over the timing of their\npregnancies. \n\n \n\nHowever all current methods have some drawbacks.\n\n\nMoreover, the perfect contraceptive is unlikely to be found in the\nnear future and may never be developed.\n\n\nBut a wider choice of good contraceptives will increase the\npossibility that, at different stages in their reproductive lives, each\nindividual or couple will find at least one method which will meet their\nparticular needs. \n\n\n  Steroid-based oral contraception  \n\n \n\nThe oral contraceptive ( OC) pill is currently the most  popular reversible method of contraception with\napproximately 55 million users world-wide.\n\n\nOf the various types of OCs available the combined oral contraceptive\n( COC), known simply as the  ` pill'  contains synthetic forms\nof the naturally occurring female steroid hormones - - estrogen and\nprogesterone. \n\n \n\nIn the usual preparations available, 21 tablets of both estrogens\nand progesterone are taken once daily from the fifth day of the menstrual\nperiod.\n\n\nWhen the whole packet is finished, the user waits seven days during\nwhich time withdrawal bleeding occurs and then starts on a new packet.\n\n\nThe pill owes its efficacy to its ability to inhibit ovulation.\n\n\nIt also causes changes in the endometrium ( lining of the uterus) and\nthe cervical secretions. \n\n \n\nDespite ongoing improvements, COCs are still associated with a\nnumber of minor side-effects such as nausea, weight gain, menstrual spotting,\nthey increase the risk of benign liver tumours, decrease the quantity of\nbreast milk and its long-term use may make some women slightly more\nsusceptible to cervical cancer.\n\n\nMore importantly OCs increase the risk of serious cardio-vascular\ndiseases including blood clots, heart attacks and strokes.\n\n\nThis risk is almost entirely confined to women over the age of 35\nyears who also smoke, or have hypertension and high levels of cholesterol.\n\n\n \n\nThe most recent bi-phasic and tri-phasic formulations are similar\nto the COCs but vary the hormonal dose over the course of the cycle thus\nreducing the total dose of synthetic hormones administered, resulting in\nfewer sideeffects.\n\n\nIn bi-phasic formulations, estrogen and progesterone are given in\nconstant doses throughout the menstrual cycle.\n\n\nIn tri-phasic formulations, estrogen and progesterone are\nadministered in three distinct phases, in varying dosages, to simulate the\nnormal menstrual cycle, resulting in less side-effects.\n\n\nIn recent years there has been increased interest in the  `\nprogesterone only'  pill - - the so called  ` mini pill'\n , which may have less risk of cardio-vascular side-effects.\n\n\nHowever, the mini pills do not suppress ovulation as effectively as\nthe COCs - - resulting in a 3 to 10 per cent failure rate per year.\n\n\nAs mini pills do not seem to interfere with lactation, they are\nideally suited for lactating mothers, because prolonged breast-feeding\nitself can contribute to the contraceptive efficacy of the pill. \n\n\n  Injectable contraceptive  \n\n \n\nIn many parts of the world and for a large number of conventional\nwomen, injections symbolize modern medicine.\n\n\nTheir association with  ` miracle drugs'  may explain\nwhy injectables are highly popular in certain parts of the world in spite of\nirregular supplies.\n\n\nThey are also a boon for women who cannot take COCs regularly, due to\npoor motivation or forgetfulness. \n\n \n\nToday there are two such preparations available in the world.\n\n\nDepo-Provera ( depot medroxy progesterone acetate or DMPA) a\nthree-monthly injectable developed in the US, and Noristerat ( norethisterone\nenanthate or NETEN) a two-monthly injectable manufactured in Germany.\n\n\nMexico and China manufacture their own once-a-month preparations.\n\n\nInjectables are not yet approved in India.\n\n\nInjectables often cause irregular mid-cycle bleeding, light or\nirregular menstrual flow and thereby after extended use even amenorrhoea (\nthe absence of any menstruation) limiting its use. \n\n\n  Contraceptive implants  \n\n \n\nNorplant consists of six capsules, each containing 36  mg of levonor gestrell which is a progesterone\nderivative.\n\n\nThe capsules made of silastic are inserted subdermally into the arm\nusing a specially designed trocar.\n\n\nRemoval is usually easy.\n\n\nNorplant-2 consisting of two slightly longer rods is also being\ntested.\n\n\nAbout 40 per cent of the users report an abnormal bleeding pattern\nduring the first year of use, but the menstrual problems diminish with time.\n\n\n\n  Vaginal rings  \n\n \n\nInjectables are not immediately reversed while implants\nrequire a small operation to be removed.\n\n\nIn contrast vaginal rings ( silicone rubber rings which are worn\nlike a pessary and release a constant dose of contraceptive steroids,\nabsorbed through the vaginal mucosa) can be reversed at any time by simply\nremoving the device.\n\n\nOne type of ring containing both estrogen and progesterone aims to\ninhibit ovulation.\n\n\nThe ring is left in place for three weeks and then removed for one\nweek, in a pattern similar to COCs.\n\n\nThe second type contains only progesterone and can be left in place\nfor three months, without removal during menstruation or at the time of\nintercourse.   \n\n\n  Intra uterine devices  \n\n \n\nIUDs in the form of pebbles, were used by Arabs for their camels\non long desert journeys.\n\n\nModern IUDS are devices made of plastic or metal or a combination of\nthese materials, meant for insertion into the uterine cavity for\ncontraception.\n\n\nUsed by an estimated 70 million women world-wide, they represent a\nvery effective, long-acting, one-stop method of contraception. \n\n \n\nAn estimated 10-15 per cent of IUD acceptors discontinue use\nbecause of pains, bleeding problems.\n\n\nBetween 5 to 15 per cent will spontaneously expel the IUD.\n\n\nIn addition IUDs are associated with 2 to 10 times greater risk of\npelvic infections.\n\n\nSince pelvic infections carry a substantial risk of subsequent\ninfertility, an IUD is not a good method for newly married couples, for women\nexposed to sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs) or those who have multiple\nsexual partners. \n\n \n\nAlthough the precise mechanism of its action is unknown,\ninterference with successful implantation of the fertilized ovum in the\nendometrium and or affection of the ovum or sperm in the uterine cavity seem\nto play a role. \n\n \n\nModifications in design over the years have significantly\nreduced failure rates and side-effects such as pain, bleeding, infection and\nexpulsion.\n\n\nThe introduction of copper-bearing IUDs represents one such advance\nin IUD design.\n\n\nCopper IUDs release small amounts of ionic copper making the uterus\nadditionally inhospitable to sperms and eggs.\n\n\nProgestgasert, an IUD which releases small amounts of progesterone\ndirectly into the uterus causes less menstrual loss and may reduce pain.\n\n\nIts drawback includes a limited life span of only one year and a\nhigher incidence of ectopic pregnancy. \n\n\n  Voluntary sterilization  \n\n \n\nOver the past two decades there has been a dramatic upswing in\nthe use of voluntary sterilization.\n\n\nWorld-wide, over one third of all couples practising an effective\nmodern method of contraception now rely on male sterilization ( vasectomy)\nor female sterilization ( tubectomy).\n\n\nOne important reason for its increased use has been the development\nof two relatively simple procedures, laparoscopic sterilization and\nmini-laparotomy which allows female sterilization to be done on an\nout-patient basis without general anaesthesia.\n\n\nMale sterilization continues to be an even safer and simpler\nprocedure.\n\n\nAlthough reversibility is possible, all current sterilization\nprocedures  \nshould be undertaken with the clear understanding that the operation is\npermanent. \n\n \n\nRecognition of the potential importance of a nonsurgical\nmethod has encouraged considerable experimentation with chemical agents\nthat block the fallopian tubes ( such as quinacrine, methyl cyanoacrilate,\nphenol and tetracycline).\n\n\nThese compounds can be injectted via the cervix into the oviducts.\n\n\nAnother technique involves the use of liquid silicone which when\ninstilled in-side the fallopian tubes, hardens in place to form a plug\npreventing the passage of eggs and sperms. \n\n\n  Barrier methods  \n\n \n\nBarrier methods which prevent the union of sperm and egg\nnecessary for pregnancy, are the oldest contraceptives known.\n\n\nCondoms, spermicides, diaphrams and other female barrier methods have\nmany early predecessors. \n\n \n\nCondoms are now being strenuously promoted in an effort to\nprevent an epidemic of AIDS and other STDs.\n\n\nCondoms need no prescription and are easily available.\n\n\nThey are especially suitable for couples who have infrequent coitus,\nduring lactation, or in teen-agers who have occasional sex, to prevent\nillegal pregnancies. \n\n \n\nThe vaginal diaphram or Dutch cap is not well accepted    \n in india as most women find it distasteful to handle their\ngenitalia for insertion of the diaphram. \n\n \n\nThe conventional cervical cap is a rubber cap or hood used to\ncover the cervix to form a barrier against sperm.\n\n\nUsed together with a spermicide, they can be left in place for about\nsix hours after intercourse. \n\n \n\nAll barrier methods continue to have the same major\ndisadvantages.\n\n\nAverage use failure rates of between 10 to 20 per cent per year, are\nmuch higher than those nonsteroidal methods or IUDS.\n\n\nMoreover they require the user to take a conscious action to avoid\npregnancy before each sexual act.\n\n\nClinical tests are now under way to evaluate a new custom - - fitted\ncap moulded to the shape and size of the cervix.\n\n\nOne such cap  ` Contracep'  may not require a\nspermicide, can be worn for extended periods and has a unique one-way valve\nthat permits menstrual flow. \n\n\n  Periodic abstinence  \n\n \n\nAbstinence from sexual intercourse during the \nfertile period, often referred to as ` natural family planning', relies on\nsuch old and new techniques as the calendar ( rhythm) method, the basal body\ntemperature ( BBT) method, the cervical mucus ( Billings ovulation)\nmethod and the sympto-thermal method.\n\n\nThe latter relies on the combination of indicators of fertility such\nas changes in cervical mucus to predict ovulation and BBT to detect its\noccurrence.\n\n\nHigh levels of motivation and good communication between sexual\npartners is essential as all methods require substantial periods of sexual\nabstinence every cycle. \n\n \n\nThe main thrust of research is in development of reliable\n ` use-at-home'  indicators of ovulation such as\ndo-it-yourself kits to test hormone levels in urine or saliva or to detect\nchanges in cervical mucus. \n\n\n  Contraceptives of the future  \n\n \n\nFour general areas of research activity are widely agreed to\nhave special importance.\n\n\nThese are concerned with menstrual induction and progesterone\ninhibitors, synthetic analogues of hypothalamus hormones, the male pill and\nanti-fertility vaccines. \n\n \n\nOne of the major gaps in current birth-control technology is\nthe lack of post-coital methods which could be used a few days or weeks after\nunprotected intercourse    ( as in cases of rape victims) to bring on a late\nmenstrual period.\n\n\nA double dose of certain full-strength COCs ( such as ovral) taken\nwithin 72 hours of unprotected intercourse and repeated after 12 hours,\ncan prevent pregnancy by interfering with fertilization or with\nimplantation of a fertilized egg. \n\n \n\nMifepristone ( RU486) a competitive inhibitor of\nprogesterone, is capable of interrupting early pregnancy when given either\nbefore or just after the first missed period.\n\n\nIn a Paris-based study of 10 women given RU486 within 10 days of a\nmissed period, 85 women aborted.\n\n\nStudies show that RU486 can be developed into a safe and effective\n ` once-a-month'  contraceptive pill. \n\n \n\nIn the last several years there has been considerable progress\ntowards an entirely new method based on synthetic analogues of hormones\nproduced in the hypothalamus of the brain.\n\n\nEarly clinical trials have shown that certain luteinizing\nhormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH) analogues administered daily are effective\nin suppressing ovulation.\n\n\nAlthough current experiments involve the use of nasal sprays, since\nthe hormones are not effective if taken orally, some type of a long-acting\nrelease system may be possible. \n\n \n\nThe contraceptive effect of the male pill ( gossypol) a\ncottonseed-oil derivative was accidentally discovered in China.\n\n\nIt decreases sperm counts to contraceptive levels.\n\n\nReversibility is possible after stopping the pills, but\ninfertility appears to become long-term or even permanent\namong 20 to 30 per cent of long-term users. \n\n \n\nAnti-fertility vaccines including immunization against pregnancy\nis an attractive idea but difficult to achieve in practice.\n\n\nThe most promising vaccination technique is immunization against\nchorionic gonadotropin ( a hormonal product of placenta which is essential\nfor pregnancy). \n\n \n\nRefinements in COCS and IUDS and better understanding of the\nrelative contra-indications to their use have made these methods extremely\nsafe.\n\n\nNew long-acting systems for delivering progesterone are effective\nand will probably be more popular in developing countries.\n\n\nUntil such time as a ideal reversible contraceptive is discovered,\nmost couples in the Third World will rely heavily on voluntary\nsterilization.\n\n\nBecause of early marriage, many couples complete their child-bearing\nby the age of 25, when they still face approximately 20 years of\nreproductive life.\n\n\nFor many of these women additional pregnancies imply serious health\nrisks, and they view permanent surgical contraception - - the one method\nwhich is virtually 100 per cent effective, not only as a good method, but\nprobably as the best method.\n\n\nHence in sequence, a newly married couple is advised the OC pill\nuntil they want their first child, thereafter the copper T for three or more\nyears which is ideal for birth-spacing and after the second child they are\nadivsed tubectomy or vasectomy.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "547082df-eb26-4aca-8fb1-349bdb92802e",

{"text": "The point of no return     \n\n \n\n  THE   press reports are sketchy\nbut alarmingly regular.\n\n\nOn an average of three times a month, we read reports on torture and\ndeaths in lock-ups, or of the grim conditions in our prisons. \n\n \n\nLast fortnight, a writ petition was filed in the Supreme Court\nseeking an inquiry into deaths in  Tihar Jail; it was\nbased on a report by the  Union for Democratic Rights\nthat 230 inmates had died in Tihar jail since 1988 - - one every 11 days.\n\n\n \n\nIn March four prisoners died in a 12 day period in West  Chaibasa jail, the victimes of unsanitary conditions. \n\n \n\nWe have read of the filth in Dum Dum prison, called a  `\ntorture cell for the mentally ill inmaters who form half its\npopulation.\n\n\nAnd the press used hundreds of column centimetres to expose the\nsituation in Bombay lock-ups after the city police illegible herded\nhundreds of people into cells after the March bomb blasts. \n\n \n\nBut neither the press reports nor the numerous judicial\ncommissions that have been appointed to inquire into prison\nconditions have been able to improve life behind bars for the\napproximately 250.000 people in  1,114 penitentiaries.\n\n\n \n\n \" Applying even the most retrogressive standards,\nIndian prisons are the pits - - a level of perversity matched only by\nour pious, moralistic and sanctimonious preaching abroad,\"  notes\nlawyer Colin Gonsalves, co-editor of the book  Leading Cases in  Rights  .\n\n\nAmong the charges Gonsalves levels at jail authorities:  \"\nRape, buggery, torture, custody without legal sanction, bars and fetters,\ndetention far in excess of the sentence, solitary confinement, the\nbrutalising of children, women and casuals, drug trafficking and\nprostitution rackets run by superintendents.\"  \n\n \n\nThe international group Human Rights Watch, which in 1991\npublished a report on prison conditions in India, faults the authorities\nfor torture in remand, rape and molestation of women in custody, deaths in\ncustody, poor medical facilities and lack of sanitation. \n\n \n\nTo the trained observer, two features of  reform\nprogramme leap to the eye.\n\n\nSays Human Rights Watch  \" The Indian jail system has a\nclass system that helps it maintain a uniqueness from penitentiaries\naround the world.\n\n\nPrisoners are classified into  ` A'  ,  ` B'\n and  ` C'  categories not on the severity of their\ncrimes but by social status, education and habit of life.\"  \n\n \n\nThe other characteristic that stands out is the system of \n` convict officers'  who are classified as watchmen, overseers and\nwarders.\n\n\nAppointed by the prison superintendents from among the ranks of\nthe longest serving inmates - - and thus those convicted of the most\nserious crimes - - they perform the duties that prison guards perform\nin other countries. \n\n \n\n \" The effect of the convict officer system is to\ntransform many Class \" C \" prisoners into personal\nservants for the convictofficers on whom they are dependent in many ways,\nparticularly for the quantity of food they get,\"  notes the Human\nRights Watch report. \n\n \n\nTo the casual visitor, however, the most striking feature of\nIndian prisons is the ridiculously high level of overcrowding.\n\n\nNew  Tihar jail has an official capacity of 2,140.\n\n\nIn January 1993 it had 7,616 inmates and the figure rose to 8,700\nearlier this year. \n\n \n\n Arthur Road jail houses 2,200 people in a\nfacility designed for 800.\n\n\nIn  Naw-pada jail, 500 men are cramped into an area\nmeant for 84.\n\n\nThe 19,700 square feet of  12 prisons hold 14,343\npeople instead of the 5,471 they are supposed to accommodate.\n\n\nThe tragedy plays itself out all around the country. \n\n \n\nThe government-run National Human Rights Commission blames\n    unconscienable   delays in\nthe disposal of cases\"  for the brutal situation.\n\n\nOvercrowding can mainly be attributed to the fact that most people in\nIndian jails are undertrials, who are not convicted.\n\n\nThe percentage varies around the country, but figures from Madhya\nPradesh are probably representative of the trend, only eight of every 100\ninimates of that  facilities have been tried and convicted.\n\n\n \n\n \" The overcrowding causes all the other problems,\"\n maintains Ramesh Aiyer, a legal aid worker in \nArthur Road prison, who has worked in facilities in Tamil Nadu.\n\n\n \" The high density of prisons means that all the\nfacilities are spread very thin.\"  \n\n \n\nThe sheer numbers ensure that the prison authorities are seldom\nable to devote attention to the problems of individual prisoners.\n\n\nAnd, of course, physical facilities are stretched beyond their\nlimits.\n\n\nBedding and clothing are not always adequate.\n\n\nThe food is often substandard ( a condition aggravated by large scale\npilferage and adulteration by the authorities in some centres).\n\n\nSanitation problems seem to follow as a matter of course. \n\n \n\n \" There was only one toilet for 75 women.\n\n\nAnd when we took our baths, we had to share two taps in the\ncourtyard,\"  recalls social worker Sangeeta Khoparde of her stay\nin Arthur Road Jail last year; her demonstrations against human rights\nviolations have also earned her stints in Kalyan and Osmanabad prisons\nwhich she says are as daunting. \n\n \n\nA magesterial inquiry into the death of prisoners in Tihar in\n1992 described the sanitary facilites thus:  \" All the toilets,\nboth inside and outside the barracks, cells and outside cells, were in\ndeplorable condition.\n\n\nThey were choked with hung mounds of excreta, which had not been\ncleared for days.\n\n\nIn some cases they were choked right up to the door and it could not\nbe opened.\n\n\nThere was absolutely no facility of water.\"  \n\n \n\nThe solution is obvious.\n\n\nNew prisons must be constructed.\n\n\nBut officials plead that they are hampered by a lack of funds and\ncannot even renovate or expand the 187 prisons that are over 100 years old\nand the 27 that are more than 130 years. \n\n \n\nSocial workers familiar with the workings of prison\nadministrators, however, believe that the problem is more than merely\nmonetary.\n\n\nThey content that insensitive, bureaucrats have allowed our prisons\nto deteriorate, and have displayed little initiative in attempting to stem\nthe rot.\n\n\nOften, the administrators have been downright incompetent. \n\n \n\n \" Our jails are run by people who are simply looking for\njobs.\n\n\nThey have no special aptitude for criminal reformation.\" \nmaintains Sheela Barse who was on the 1988 National Experts Committee\non Women Prisoners. \n\n \n\nDr D R Singh, head of the department of criminology and\ncorrectional administration at the Tata Institute of Social Science\nbelieves that the families in the  intends to hire\ntrained staff to administer correctional facilities.\n\n\nJailors around the country land their jobs by appearing for a\nstatelevel competitive examination.\n\n\nSingh maintains that the perfunctory training that they receive is\nof dubious value. \n\n \n\nExperts contend that a system stalled by indifferent\nadministrators only breeds corruption.\n\n\nAnd it has resulted in the Indian prison sytem acquiring a character\nthat is more punitive than reformative. \n\n \n\nJail supervisors, ignorant of the basic tenets of psychology,\noften order even harmless prisoners to be fettered for long periods.\n\n\nThis attitude also leads to several categories of prisoners being put\nin the cells together.\n\n\nPetty criminals, first-time offenders, juveniles and non-criminal\nlunatics are housed with hardened criminals.\n\n\nThe herding together of these incongruent groups subverts the basic\nfunction of incarceration.\n\n\nAs psychologist Jyotsna Shah recently noted, instead of serving as\ntherapy and guidance centres, Indian jails  \" function with a built-in\ncontagious sub-culture of crime.\"  \n\n \n\nFrom the records, one would wonder how things have been allowed\nto reach this perilous state: the shelves of government libraries are\ncreaking with advice from a profusion of national and state-level\ncommittees and study groups.\n\n\nProgressive programmes have been drawn up.\n\n\nThe Mulla committee of 1983, for example, prescribed

country, these\nsuggestions have to be implemented.\n\n\nEven the Indian jail Committee, Report of 1919-20 still has to be\nfully adopted, so how can you expect them to consider something so

repeatedly\nbeaten and administered shocks during their eight-day-long detention.\n\n\nThe reason?\n\n\nThe Ghaziabad police wanted to force  brother, Atul to\nsurrender.\n\n\n crime?\n\n\nHe had married the daughter of a liquor contracter, against her  wishes. \n\n \n\nIgnorance, corruption and perennial shortages explain in part\nthe horrendous conditions of prison life.\n\n\nBut they do not

{"text": "Does Religion Divide ? \n\n \n\nReligion is a pure and a    holy  \naspect created by man.\n\n\nThe man  is not satisfied till now.\n\n\nJust as Ruskin Bond says that  \" Man is the only wealth on the\nEarth\" \n\n\n   In   the same way each individual    says   that Religion is the only \nwealth which he follows in his    livelihood. \n\n\n\nReligion is created by man; as man was created by God what is\nReligion?\n\n\nReligion is nothing but      \nthe only way or  a medium to find God or to go nearer to God, or\nto approach God.\n\n\nAnd to do this great thing people started their \nprocedure in different ways.\n\n\nThose who followed the way  invented a new religion\nstarted  propoganda &  named it a serious &\nstupid one say as a  \" Religion\"  . \n\n \n\nIf it is observed no Religion teaches us how to go to hell.\n\n\nAll religions    teach   one & the only\nthing that is God is great, created the universe, and do good things in your\nlife you will be soon helped by  God.\n\n\nBut no  religious book   \nspecifies   that you should not follow other religion & other  God.\n\n\nAll the human beings say that their religion is the only original\nreligion & thus it was created universally & it is the oldest of any other\nreligion.\n\n\nIs it true?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n The oldest one is man & the earth.\n\n\nThe way to seek God is a Religion & the way to get the religion is do\nyour work sincerely, obey your elders, follow what is good, and many other\nsuch things which could please the other men.\n\n\nTo please our friends & all the creatures in the earth is the only\nway to go to God &  called a religion. \n\n \n\nBut now a days people are after money, and any how they are\nmaking money as their religion.\n\n\nMoney is the only source to make many friends.\n\n\nAnd to earn money man started exploiting other religion & other men.\n\n\nElections are to be held only at the base of money.\n\n\nThe ministers give speeches and those speeches are related to\nreligion.\n\n\n Religion was the only cause we the Indians were\nruled by the Britishers for 200 yrs.\n\n\nReligion was the only cause we people got   \nseparated   into Pak & India and religion was the only reason why\nstill the Indians are  so backward country. \n\n \n\nToday even in India if you go and ask any citizen of India\n  your name? and who are you    ? \"\n  \n\n\n   their   first reply would be \n \"  my name is so & so and I am a Maharashtrian or I am from Gujarat\nor from    Tamil Nadu   or any thing else,\nbut they never say   \"  I am an Indian.  \"  \n\n\nReligion is the only thing what we the Indian citizen need to know\nfirst & then later their qualifications & etc.\n\n\nThis is a very    typical   nature of\nthe Indians.\n\n\nWe know in Indian history many kings & warriors have sacrificed their\nlives only just only for their mother land and not for their religion, but\nnowadays people of India elect and sell their mother land just because of the\nsilly religion, and they do not feel sorry when    they\n  get hurt from those leaders.\n\n\nThe leaders enjoy their leadership and to get the same again they\nintroduce the same religion problem.\n\n\nIndians are still stressing on religion, but can we guess, when we\nare getting rid of this religion?\n\n\n      too difficult.\n\n\nHence the religion problem in our country can't be removed at any\ncost.\n\n\nOur Father of Nation Gandhiji expected India to be a    socialist   & secular nation, he dreamt India to\nbe as a   \" Ram Raj\"    full of\npeace without any discrimination of caste, colour and creed.\n\n\nBut all in vain.\n\n\nNow people instead of following Gandhiji, & think they have almost\nforgotten our great  Ahimsa  King Mahatma Gandhiji. \n\n \n\nIf the stupid religion would not be invented then imagine what\nwould have    happened.  \n\n\nNo wonder there could be peace, but <*> dotted line </*>    , early   in the morning people would get up and they\nall would have come together, happily they would have gone to pray & then go\nto their respective    jobs.  \n\n\nLater they would have discussed about their living being.\n\n\nWhat actually a man needs    are   Food,\nClothing & Shelter.\n\n\nThe they would have been distributed in    three\n  different aspects & start working harder and harder for earning\ntheir    livelihood.  \n\n\nNo    man   would have enough time to chit\n chat about the religion.\n\n\nAnd hence there would have been no caste & creed, no blacks & whites\n& no Indians & Pakistinis.\n\n\nAll would have been one and such a peaceful life would have been \n  there.  \n\n\nAccording to me there should not be religion.\n\n\nIf there would be religion then there should only be one religion\nwhich should not differentiate any king or a  Shatriya, Brahaman\nVaishya  &  Shudra  nor any  shias  and\n sunnis  or  Roman Catholic, or    Protestants   or any thing else, then it can be\ncalled as a pure religion.  \n\n \n\nNow a days religion is used as a weapon at any part of their\nlife.\n\n\nIf you go any unknown  house, no wonder they would\nask  water for you but before that they ask your name & then\nslowly your religion, if it is nearer to the hosts religion then their\nhospitality would be good, but if it is not then they would    drive   you out.\n\n\nIn the same way if a Hindu goes to a mosque the people present there\nwould be    surprised   to see him there &\nwhen he goes out the people of his religion would anxiously ask about their\nminus points in the mosque.\n\n\nThis way various religion people like their own religion to be\nsuperior & the one & the only ancient religion.\n\n\nThey would not like the other religion to be praised or    compared   to them. \n\n \n\nHence it is true that though religion is    an\n  abstract thing & it is invented by man and the same \nman    is   the one who made different religions\nand they are the    ones   who distributed men into\nvarious classes, but they are the    ones   who are\nalways fighting against each other, though they    know\n  that religion is not created by God.\n\n\nSo it is obvious that religions divide, but if man still beleives in\nthe    super-religion   soon\nthey would forget the  creation & start killing the whole\nworld. \n\n \n\nHence it is good to say follow all religions and take or grasp\nonly the good and best things that are followed from all the religions. \n\n\n\n\n\n  DRUG ADDICTION  \n\n \n\nDrug addiction means physical dependence upon a  drug including development of tolerance &   \nwithdrawl   .\n\n\nAn addict who develops tolerance requires more of the drug to\ntransport him to  his world of   \nfantacies   .\n\n\nIf the drug is stopped suddenly, the addict suffers from painful &\nun-controllable convulsions, vomitting, depression & various other maladies.\n\n\nIt is immaterial whether the addiction is physical or psychological.\n\n\nPeople take to drug to feel    differently.\n \n\n\nMany drugs gives the users a kick, eradicating the frustrations &\nadversities that life throws in his way.\n\n\nWhat they forget or does not understand is that problems drowned by\ndrugs come back with a vengeance to torment them once the effect wears off.\n\n\nThe  endeavour is escapist & it is doomed in\ncatastrophic failure even before it begins. \n\n \n\nDrugs used in India may be categorised into narcotics\nhallucinogens, stimulants & sedatives.\n\n\n   Marijuana   opium, heroin,\nbarbiturates &    amphetamines   are all\nhabit forming drugs. \n\n \n\nSpelled as marijuana also, this is the Indian hemp.\n\n\nIts tetrahydro cannabinol ( THC) content is the real drug content &\nits largest concentration is in the flowering top of the plant.\n\n\nDrug content in the leaves is comparatively less  concentrated\n .\n\n\nResin collected from the tops of potent Cannabis Sativa is called\nHashis ( hash).\n\n\nIt is considered to be five times    greater\n  than marijuana.\n\n\nSide effects of this drug is greater & more injurious.\n\n\nThose drugs are inhaled in smoke form; rolled into cigarettes known\nin common parlance as  \" joints\"  .\n\n\nBoth marijuana & hashish can be added to food & drink. \n\n \n\nAs soon as  smoke is inhaled, eyes become red, heart\nbeat increases & usually the smoker coughs.\n\n\nHunger & drowsiness normally follows inhalation of smoke.\n\n\nThe smoker gets distortions of vision & hearing.\n\n\nHe loses sense of time.\n\n\nUsually the smoker thinks that his thought process has become clear &\nbetter.\n\n\nPerformance is hampered even though the addict way not be aware of\nit.\n\n\nExperiencing non-existing things & false convictions may also  happen.\n\n\nUnfounded suspicions of anything & everything    accompanied   by anxiety, uncontrolled laughter or weeping &\nirrational mental fixations are also noticed. \n\n \n\nThe hallucinogens are drugs that provoke changes in sensation,\n   thought   process, selfawarness & emotions.\n\n\nAberrations  in the perception of time & space happen,\nillusion, delusion or hallucination may vary in intensity in accordance with\nthe dosage linhaled.\n\n\nMarijuana smokers stand the danger of ceasing to become  \"\nhigh\"  on smoke & may have to take    recourse\n  to heavier drugs.\n\n\nAnd the results produced by the same amount of drug may vary in the\nsame person depending upon circumstances. \n\n \n\nLSD ( Lysergic Acid) is the best studied & most powerful\nhallucinogen.\n\n\nThese drugs are both synthetic & natural.\n\n\n   Mescolin   made from peyote\ncactus,  psllocybin  from Mexican mushroom  sheeds  of morning\nglory.\n\n\nDMT, STP, MDA & innumerable others are known & used.\n\n\nMarijuana with TCH is also termed medically as hallucinogen. \n\n \n\nFor LSD user, there are two kinds of experiences.\n\n\nOne is good & other is bad.\n\n\nA good trip gives pleasant images while a bad  \" trip\"\n ( hammer) fills him with    terror   .\n\n\nEither extreme euphoria or insufferable terror is the result.\n\n\nConsequences are just unpredictable, the extreme being homicide or\nsuicide. \n\n \n\n most detrimental effect is flashback.\n\n\nIf one is an LSD addict, some of the features of the time when he was\nunder LSD come back & influence him even though he is not under LSD.\n\n\nIt can be induced by psychological stress, by medication or by\nmarijuana.\n\n\nSuch flashbacks can cause   \nschizophrenia   or extreme anxiety.\n\n\nFear & anxiety induced by such a state can lead to suicide. \n\n \n\nAmphitamines, called stimulants are supposed to increase\nalertness, increase vigour & reduce hunger.\n\n\nMedically it is used to reduce hunger, & reduce depression.\n\n\nCocaine amphetermise ( Banezedrine  \" bennies\"  ) .\n\n\nDextroamphetamine & Methample  taonine  come under this\ncategory.\n\n\nStimulants are known  in common parlance as  \"\nappears\"  or  \" pep-pills\"  .\n\n\nThey are usually taken as capsules or tablets.\n\n\nThey are also inhaled ( snorted).\n\n\nInjections in veins is resorted to for immediate effect.\n\n\nA relative new type of abuse is inject massive doses intravenously\nfrom one to a dozen times a day.\n\n\nThey are    effective   in the same\nway as cocaine users.\n\n\nThis type of user is called a  \" speed freak\"  . \n\n \n\nIn ordinary quantities, amphetamines \nprovide a temporary sense of alertness & well being.\n\n\nHunger is reduced & the performance of an exhausted person is\nimproved. \n\n \n\nNarcotics relieves pain & induces pain.\n\n\nOpium & its active components such as morphine & heroin ( morphine\nstrengthened six times) are of this group.\n\n\nOpium is derived from the ooze collected from opium poppy plant (\n papaver sonniferum  ) .\n\n\nDried ooze becomes a semi solid mass.\n\n\nThe opium is refined to make smoking opium.\n\n\nIt contain morphine, narcotine, papaverine, the boinc, narcoine &\ncodeine. \n\n \n\nPeople in all kinds of pain take heroin for relief.\n\n\nSometimes people are introduced to drugs by friends.\n\n\nYoungsters get the habit from grownups.\n\n\nSome people think occasional use will not make them addicts.\n\n\nCalled weekened joy poppers, they end up as habitual heroin takers.\n\n\nPure heroin if injected, can kill within   \nminutes   .\n\n\nUnclean implements used for injections may lead to viral hepatitis\nskin abscess, inflammation of veins & congestion of the lungs.\n\n\nTuberculosis & pneumonia are diseases that an addict can become\nprone to. \n\n \n\nDrug addiction substantially reduces sober time    available   to a person.\n\n\nAnd that time will be spent in heroin & establishing the necessary\ncontacts.\n\n\nThe family is destroyed, the  personality is\nstunted & his emotions become intense &    distorted\n  .\n\n\nFertility is reduced & children born may have serions illness\nwithdrawal symptoms. \n\n \n\nDrug purchasers should be treated as tempters & they should be\nostracised & avoided like  agents.\n\n\nGovernments are engaged in an all out fight against this diabolic\ntraffice & it is the duty of every citizen to cooperate infighting this\nmenace.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a21e22fd-cc7f-4af1-a535-57604d366ad0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.192793+00:00"}
{"text": "10 \n\n \n\nThe rail car came out of the long tunnel into the Himalayan\ncountry.\n\n\nTunnel number 16 was the dividing point between the plains and the\nhills.\n\n\nUnder the early evening light, the earth was covered with pastel\nshades of green.\n\n\nThe white car pulled up at Barog station, and everyone, except two\npassengers, got out to have tea. \n\n \n\nA girl who had been sitting on the other side came over and opened\nthe window in front of Bauji.\n\n\nThe cool air poured in.\n\n\n ` Chinese set to grab our land'  , screamed a newsboy.\n\n\nLeaning far out of the window, the girl called out to the boy.\n\n\nShe spoke louder than necessary, as if he were a great distance away.\n\n\n \n\nThe boy, weighed down with books, papers and magazines, hurriedly\nwalked over to her.\n\n\nHis face was partially buried in a scarf.\n\n\nIt must be could, thought Bauji.\n\n\nAnd here was this boy burdened by the useless rhetoric of\npoliticians.\n\n\nIt was good to be free and a democracy, but the politicians were a\nprice that had to be paid for this privilege.\n\n\nThe girl bought a newspaper, and a copy of the \" \nIllustrated Weekly of India  . \" \n\n \n\n \"  getting cold isn't it?\"  she said\nto the boy as he handed her the change.\n\n\nBauji was bothered by the melancholy news of the Chinese, but he\ntried to put it out of his mind.\n\n\nInstead, he thought of the girl.\n\n\nHe thought that she had a beautiful young voice, but it was also a\nlittle sad.\n\n\nFrom the material and the cut of her coat, he surmised that she came\nfrom a wealthy family.\n\n\nHer youth and her manner suggested that she was unmarried; her tone\nof voice was that of someone who was used to getting her way. \n\n \n\nThe girl shut the window, and pressed her hands to her slightly\nred cheeks.\n\n\nShe moved back to her seat.\n\n\nThe tea drinkers returned+ the dining room, and the rail car pulled\naway from the station.\n\n\nIt had begun to grow dark outside and soon the lights were turned on\ninside the car.\n\n\nAs a result, the windows were transformed into mirrors, and it\ncreated a strange atmosphere of forced intimacy.\n\n\nPutting his face against the window, Bauji tried to look out.\n\n\nThe sky  behind the mountain carried red traces of the\nsetting sun.\n\n\nIndividual shapes on the dusky landscape although still visible,\nwere becoming harder to distinguish.\n\n\nThe train climbed the northern slope of the second range into another\ntunnel.\n\n\nThey came out at the other end in a mountain valley.\n\n\nSudden faint bursts of colour appeared from the chasms between the\nmountain peaks. \n\n \n\nHis gaze returned to the girl, who was now absorbed in the\nmagazine.\n\n\nHe was looking at her from an unusual angle, and peculiar emotions\nwelled up inside him.\n\n\nAs he stared at her long neck, bent slightly to one side, he seemed\nto feel the vital memory of the woman he had left behind in Pakistan.\n\n\nHowever, the more he tried to call up a clear picture, the more his\nmemory failed him.\n\n\nShe seemed to fade far away, leaving him with nothing to catch or to\nhold.\n\n\nIn the midst of the clouded past, the neck of the girl in front\nreappeared - - it was damp - - and it seemed to push him forward into the\nfuture.\n\n\nSuddenly  eyes floated before him.\n\n\nHe gasped in astonishment.\n\n\nThe figures and the background were unrelated, sometimes vivid, other\ntimes dim, melting together in a strange combination of the past and the\npresent.\n\n\nA light from the outside unexpectedly flashed on the \nface, and Bauji felt his chest rise at its strange beauty.\n\n\nThe face in the mirror-window moved steadily across the landscape.\n\n\n \n\nHe woke up with a start.\n\n\nAs he came to, he realised he must have been dreaming.\n\n\nThe reflection of the girl in front was still there in the window.\n\n\nHe hastily lowered his eyes, feeling guilty for having+ at the\nstranger.\n\n\nTo cover up his embarrassment, he put his face to the window and\nlooked at the darkness outside.\n\n\nAt the next moment, he pulled out a large white handkerchief, and\ncleared the steam which had gathered on the window. \n\n \n\nThe bewitching stranger continued to read.\n\n\nFrom the way her shoulders were gathered, Bauji sensed an\nindependence of nature.\n\n\nThe peculiar angle at which her neck was tilted suggested more,\nperhaps a touch of arrogance.\n\n\nThere was a fierce intentness in her eyes, which did not permit her\neven to blink.\n\n\nIt was a cool, piercing beauty, which exerted a strange, unreal power\nin the mirror-window.\n\n\nFeeling startled, Bauji lowered his eyes again.\n\n\nAlthough he knew it was improper to stare like this, he consoled\nhimself with the thought that there was no way for her to know that she was\nthe object of his attention.\n\n\nFrom where he sat, he could see what she was reading.\n\n\nHaving just completed a short story, she was now skimming over an\narticle on  China policy.\n\n\nThe man sitting next  to her also saw her\nreading it, and he could not contain himself. \n\n \n\n \" How dare the Chinese cast eyes on our land!\" \nhe said to her with outrage in his voice. \n\n \n\n \" Well, it is disputed territory, isn't it ? \" \nsaid the girl. \n\n \n\n  \" Disputed, my foot !\n\n\nThey have tricked us.\n\n\nFirst they talk of friendship and   Hindi-Chini bhai bhai\n  and then they want to take over our soil.\"  \n\n\nBefore the girl could answer, he turned around to face Bauji, hoping\nto find a more sympathetic listener.\n\n\nBauji did not want to talk to the man, but he changed his mind\nbecause he thought it might be a way to get to know the girl. \n\n \n\n \" It is  fault for believing them,\"\n said Bauji.\n\n\n  \" He is too much of an idealist and forgets that the\npursuit of the  self-interest is the only responsible course\nfor a leader.\n\n\nMoralising must take second place.\n\n\nHe feels let down by the Chinese because he trusted+\n\n\nAnd  no room for trust in these things.\" \n \n\n \n\nNot finding Bauji sympathetic to his point of view, the man\ngrunted and turned around in a huff.\n\n\nThe girl did not get a chance to say anything because of the abrupt\nway the man closed the subject.\n\n\nOr more likely, Bauji thought, she did not want to get into a\nconversation with strangers.\n\n\nThe rail car again became silent and Bauji went back into his own\nprivate world. \n\n \n\nBauji was startled when the rail car reached Simla.\n\n\nHe saw the girl rise.\n\n\nHe had been lost in thought for three-quarters-of-an-hour.\n\n\nHis private battles against Nehru as well as his secret romance in\nthe mirror-window had disappeared in the reality of the brightly lit\nplatform.\n\n\nSuddenly, he spotted Tara and Seva Ram in the distance.\n\n\nHe did not wait for them to approach, but stepped out of the carriage\nwith a resolute step.\n\n\nAs soon as Tara reached him, she flung her arm around his neck, drew\nhim rapidly to her, and embraced her father warmly.\n\n\n eyes sought out the attractive stranger, who was now\non the platform, surrounded by several equally well-dressed people.\n\n\nShe obviously belonged to the best society.\n\n\nStanding there, he thought she was not beautiful, but rather there\nwas a youthful elegance and grace about her whole figure.\n\n\nAs he looked around, she too turned her head.\n\n\nHer shining, dark eyes, that looked darker from the thick lashes,\nrested with cold attention on his face ( as though she were recognising him)\nand then she promptly turned away.\n\n\nIn that brief look, he noticed a suppressed eagerness which flitted\nbetween her brilliant eyes and a faint smile that curved her lips.\n\n\nIt was the look of a young lady who is sure of her own beauty, and\nlike all such women, a little cruel.  \n\n \n\n \"  very sweet, isn't she?\"  said\nTara. \n\n \n\n  \" Sweet?\n\n\nDo you know her?\"   \n\n \n\n \" Yes,\"  relied Tara, as she waved to the girl,\nwho waved back enthusiastically.\n\n\nThere was a bustle in the station as the+ train from Kalka was\napproaching, several hours late.\n\n\nThe black and white signal indicated  ` down'  , and\nthere was a rush of porters, attendants and people meeting the train.\n\n\nThrough the vapour, could be seen ill-clad workmen crossing the\nrails.\n\n\nThe engine whistled in the distance.\n\n\nSeconds later, the platform was quivering, and with puffs of steam\nhanging low in the air from the cold, the engine rolled up, the lever of its\nmiddle wheel rhythmically moving up and down, and the figure of the engine\ndriver stooping low. \n\n \n\nIn the confusion of the arriving train, the girl had disappeared\nin the crowd.\n\n\n \" Can you guess?\"  asked Tara. \n\n \n\n  \" What?\"   \n\n \n\n  \" Who she is?\"   \n\n \n\nHe shook his head. \n\n \n\n  \" Your friend Sanat  grand-daughter.\n\n\nShe lives here with her mother.\"   \n\n \n\n  \" What is her name?\"   \n\n \n\n  \" Priti.\"   \n\n\n  11 \n\n \n\nIt was the day of the  reception.\n\n\nSince morning, Arjun had been in a state of wild excitement.\n\n\nAs he was combing his hair in the mirror, he was overcome with\ndespair.\n\n\nHe thought he was not good looking.\n\n\nHe imagined there could be no happiness for one with such long ears,\nsuch a broad nose, thick lips, and brown eyes as his.\n\n\nHe would have given anything for a handsome face so that he could\nappear attractive to Priti. \n\n \n\nKaran came promptly at seven to collect them for the reception.\n\n\nHe had informed the Mehtas that  Bauji  would also\ncome.\n\n\nWhen Karan saw Tara, his eyes widened and he remarked that she\nlooked beautiful.\n\n\nShe felt flattered because she had gone to considerable trouble to\nput up her hair in a special bun, which was considered fashionable at the\ntime.\n\n\nArjun too was proud of his+ and thought that she looked lovely in\nher Madras silk  sari  .\n\n\nSo rarely did they go out that Arjun felt it strange to see his\nmother all dressed up.\n\n\nHe was proud that her thick hair was still black, and the bun showed\nher long neck and her ears to advantage.\n\n\nShe wore her  sari  in modern style, comfortably and\nnot too tightly, with a nicely cut blouse, which focused on her attractive\nbosom and gave her a lean and youthful look. \n\n \n\nKaran invited  Bauji  to ride in his rickshaw but\n Bauji  refused.\n\n\nHe was still upset with Karan.\n\n\nThus father and daughter rode together and Arjun rode with Karan.\n\n\nAs they rode to the Mehta house in the raw chill of the Simla\nautumn, Arjun tried to imagine the brilliance of the grand reception that\nawaited them -- the brightly lit drawing rooms, the splendour of the clothes,\nthe sumptuously laid food, the dignitaries and important people.\n\n\nKaran had said in an off-hand way that a Cabinet Minister and the\nGovernor would be coming, as well as several members of the diplomatic corps\nwho were visiting Simla.\n\n\nWhile Arjun was lost in the spectacle of his imagination, Tara was\npreoccupied in safeguarding her hair and her silk  sari  .\n\n\n \n\nAs they approached the Mehta house, they were impressed by  the brilliant lights which blazed from the numerous\nwindows of the mansion.\n\n\nA police guard stood at the brightly lit, carpeted entrance.\n\n\nAs the rickshaws drove away, new ones took their place.\n\n\nFrom the rickshaws descended beautifully dressed women.\n\n\nBefore Arjun realized what was happening, they were in the mirrored\nvestibule, taking off their coats, helped by a liveried servant.\n\n\nArjun tried to assume a dignified manner appropriate to the\noccasion.\n\n\nHe glanced into the mirrors, but he could not see himself clearly.\n\n\nHe seemed to+ a part of one glittering whole.\n\n\nAs they reached the door leading to the main drawing room, a\ncontinuous sound of voices and glasses and the rustle of silk  saris\n greeted them.\n\n\nAmrita was at the door, and she smiled at them.\n\n\nShe greeted  Bauji  with special warmth.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "Deshbandhu College in Ferment \n\n \n\nTurmoil gripped Deshbandhu College in South Delhi when its\nteachers and other employees launched an agitation for elevation of a senior\nsection officer to the post of its administrative officer.\n\n\nThis affected the holding of the classes.\n\n\nThe students, thereupon, took upon themselves the task of running the\nclasses, with the senior ones amongst themselves teaching the junior ones.\n\n\nHowever, the teachers and other employees of the college complained\nthat they had been prevented from entering the premises by the students,\nwhich was, however, denied by the principal, Mr. Balbir Singh, who stated\nthat the college alumni had obtained his permission to conduct the classes as\nthe teachers were refraining from doing their job.\n\n\nThe teachers association decried the  unethical\ninvolvement of the students as setting a dangerous precedent.  \n\n\n\n\n Strike by AIIMS Doctors \n\n \n\nIn protest against an alleged act of victimisation of a doctor\nin the CTVS ( cardiological and vascular surgery) department, Samba\nMurty, by its head, Dr. Venugopal, recently, about 550 senior and junior\nresident doctors of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS), New\nDelhi, observed a token strike on December 20, 1989.\n\n\nAs a result, the work in the AIIMS was thrown out of gear, mostly\naffecting the casualty department, OPD ( Out patient department), OT (\noperation theatre), wards and laboratories in the hospital. \n\n \n\nAccording to the Resident  Association, Dr.\nSamba Murty had been failed in his departmental examination maliciously by\nDr. Venugopal, who was biased against the former.\n\n\nIt was alleged that in 1987, Dr. Murty had been falsely involved\nin a case in which a consultant of the department was at fault, and kept out\nof the OT and ward duties.\n\n\nOn the intervention of the Resident  association,\nDr. Samba Murty had been taken back in the department.\n\n\nSubsequently, during the next two years, Dr. Venugopal boycotted\nall his teaching exercises and did not allow him to assist in surgery and\nenter the OT.\n\n\nThe RDA has demanded Dr. Samba  re-examination in a\njust and fair manner. \n\n \n\nHowever, an AIIMS spokesman subsequently denied there having\nbeen any victimisation of the candidate or any other kind of irregularity in\nhis examination.  \n\n\n\n\n Head  Daughter burnt by In-laws \n\n \n\nMr. Baldev Raj, a head constable of the Delhi Police, made the\nallegation that his daughter, Mrs. Asha Rani Kalra, aged 30, was set on\nfire and killed on December 10, 1989.\n\n\nThe local police, it was alleged, was not conducting any proper\ninvestigation into the case.\n\n\nThe place of the occurrence of the crime had not been marked off nor\nthe inculpating things, such as the burnt clothes of the victim, seized.\n\n\nMr. Raj further alleged that the investigating officer had so far\nfailed to sound the neighbours on the tragic happening or visit their houses.\n\n\nThese allegations were, however, denied by the Assistant Commissioner\nof Police of the area.  \n\n\n\n\n The Lamp of Delhi   Gharana   still\nFlickers \n\n \n\nThe various   gharanas   of the Indian\nclassical music have played an important role in nourishing and nurturing\nits rich traditions and making their own contributions to its further\ndevelopment.\n\n\nThe Delhi   gharana   , contrary to the\nbelief of many  connoisseurs  , is not at all moribund,\nbut still alive and kicking.\n\n\n \" I stand comparison with any other vocalist, there is no\ninstrumentalist to beat down Zahoor Ahmed, and our Shafaat is hard to be\nexcelled by any other percussionist on the  tabla  , \"\n asserted the Delhi   gharana khalifa   or\ndoyen, Iqbal Ahmed Khan, with a firm, sincere note in his voice. \n\n \n\nIndian classical music is broadly demarcated into two genres - -\nthe Hindustani or North Indian and Karnataki. \n\n \n\nA   gharana   , as the word\netymologically indicates, means a particular style or  genre  of\nmusic which has grown in a   ghar   or household,\nwith the help of a  maestro  of the art, and spread\namongst his family members and other disciples over the decades and even\ncenturies.\n\n\nThus, there have evolved the Seni ( Rampur), Agra, Gwalior, Lucknow,\nand the like,   gharanas   . \n\n \n\nThe Indian Council of Cultural Relations ( ICCR) has been, of\nlate, arranging concerts under its  Parivar Parampara  series,\nto focus attention of the music-loving public on the traditional, distinctive\nniceties and nuances the different   gharanas   in\nIndia have, over the past so many years, developed and shaped, each in its\nown way, to enrich the Indian classical music.\n\n\nOn the 15th December, 1989, the ICCR organised a concert to highlight\nthe characteristic achievements of the Delhi   gharana \n with the participation of Sayeed Zafar (  sitar  ) ,\nIqbal Ahmed Khan ( vocal), Zahoor Ahmed Khan ( violin) and Shafaat Ahmed\nKhan (  tabla  ) . \n\n \n\nA pleasurable  Kirwani  was the theme of Sayeed\n  sitar  , giving flashes of his expertise as\na  virtuoso  of sorts.\n\n\nIqbal Ahmed  rendition of the   raag \nAnand Bihag  was followed by a mixed  Piloo Thumri  .\n\n\nZahoor  violin, accompanied with the percussion (\n tabla  ) of Shafaat Ahmed Khan, gave a good account of the\n  raag  Bageswari  , characterised with the \n gayaki   and   tankari angs  \nalike. \n\n \n\nThe Delhi   gharana   , tracing its\ngenesis to Amir Khusro, the great Sufi bard, though now a bit off its\npristine glory and glamour, has preserved its stylistic purity and the\ncharacteristic versatility of its   taans   , \n bandishes   and   layakari   .\n\n\nOne, however, would hope that the thinning phalanx of the\npractitioners of this   gharana   , which can now\nboast of only a few  virtuosi  and a  maestro\n or two, would be swollen with the addition of more creative\nstalwarts of the art.  \n\n\n\n\n A turn of the wheel of fortune \n\n \n\nMr. Bhure Lal was the official in the Finance Ministry in the\nerstwhile Prime Minister Rajiv  Government, who, as the\nDirector of Enforcement, was entrusted by the then Finance Minister V.P.\nSingh with the task of hiring the US detective agency, Fairfax, to obtain\ninformation of the Indian holders of secret numbered accounts in certain\nSwiss banks.\n\n\nIt may be recalled that this event led to the parting of ways between\nthe former Prime Minister and his Finance Minister.\n\n\nSoon, thereafter, Mr. V.P. Singh was shifted to the Defence Ministry\nand Mr. Bhure Lal from his post of Director of Enforcement to that of\nJoint Secretary, currency and coins, Finance Ministry.\n\n\nWith the induction of Mr. V.P. Singh as Prime Minister of the new\n Janata Dal  - National Front Government, Mr. Bhure Lal, a\nclose confidant of his, has been appointed as a Joint Secretary in the  office.  \n\n\n\n\n Lock-out in Indian  Delhi Chapter   \n\n \n\nThe journalist and non-journalist employees of the Delhi edition\nof  The Indian Express  , who had been for long agitating in this\nbehalf, went on strike, a few days ago, having failed to get the management\nto meet their demands for the refixation of their scales of salaries and\nwages in terms of the Bachawat Commission report, which treated the chain\nnewspapers as representing a single composite establishment.\n\n\nSubsequently, on its heels,  The Indian Express \nmanagement declared a lock-out, dubbing the  demands as\nunwarranted and unacceptable. \n\n \n\nCondemning the lock-out, the Indian Federation of Working\nJournalists ( Democratic) and the All India Newspaper \nFederation, in a press statement, held that the \nrefusal to honour the Bachawat Commission award would have been justified, if\nit could have obtained a court order to stay the implementation of the scales\nof wages, etc., fixed by it. \n\n \n\nThe wage board documents revealed, the DUJ and DSNEF maintained,\nthat the Indian Newspaper Society, the representative organisation of the\nnewspaper employers, had admitted that for the clubbing of newspaper\nestablishments for the purpose of wage fixation, the test of functional\nintegrity should be treated as the supreme one of its kind.\n\n\nThe Bachawat Commission report stated,   \" Functional\nintegrity has been provided by us as one of the indicators of common\ncontrol.\n\n\nUnits, apparently separate, if they have functional integrity\nor constitute a composite whole, lose their individual character <*>\ndotted-line</*>\"   \n\n \n\nThe DUJ and DSNEF gave out that it was in keeping with this\nformula that all the Goenka newspapers have been clubbed as one establishment\nwith respect to the fixation of the scales of wages. \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, the Delhi Union of Journalists, an affiliate of the\nNational Union of Journalists ( India), expressed its full sympathy with the\nemployees of  The Indian Express  now on strike.\n\n\nThe DUJ called for the intervention of the Delhi Administration and\nthe Union Government in the dispute, declaring the lock-out illegal.\n\n\nThe Delhi  Association President Balbir K.\nPunj stated that his organisation was arranging to challenge the illegal\nlock-out in a law court.  \n\n\n\n\n  Carnival - - a crowd puller             \n\n\n By <@AS> A Staff Reporter {#} \n\n \n\n<@PR> PANJIM {#}, <@DR> Feb. 24 {#}:\nThe  Carnival, which got off to a flying start here this\nmorning, turned out to be a tremendous crowd puller, with a large number of\nfloats marching through the streets of the city to the tune of music. \n\n \n\nThe highlight of the carnival was the fun car/motorcycle/cycle\nrally which had all sorts of vehicles including some junk ones, either driven\nor being pulled along the road.\n\n\nA couple of bullock carts were also there in the rally one of which\nwas driven by motorcycles. \n\n \n\nThe fun rally was flagged-off by the Mayor of the city Mr.\nFrancisco Branco, in the presence of MLA Mr. J.B.

{"text": "THE PURSUIT OF HUMAN EXCELLENCE   \n\n\n SRI  SWAMI RANGANATHANANDA  \n\n\n  Introduction  \n\n \n\nWE INDULGE in so many kinds of pursuits in India today, of\nwhich the most important, and, to many people, the only one, is  the\npursuit of money-making  .\n\n\nThe pursuit of money, the pursuit of pleasure, and the pursuit of\npower - - these three pursuits have frozen our hearts all these forty-five\nyears of our post-independence existence, and have almost destroyed the\ncreative spirit of our people and taken the nation to the brink of despair.\n\n\nThis evil tendency can be reversed only by a new pursuit, which will\nhelp to purify all other pursuits and destroy whatever is evil in them;\n and that new pursuit is the pursuit of human excellence.  \n\n\n  The Ethical Education of our Children  \n\n \n\nA new India is coming up in our children of the present\ngeneration.\n\n\nThey are unlike the children of the earlier generations; they have\nmore of what our  Vedanta  calls the energy of  \nrajoguna   in place of the inertia of   tamoguna\n  .\n\n\nThey are more intelligent, more vivacious, more alert, more fearless,\nand more straightforward; these are sterling character assets, and\nrepresent the early stages of  spiritual growth, according to\nSwami Vivekananda.\n\n\nBut they are deficient in social sense, in social responsibility, and\nin the concern for other individuals and groups; they also exhibit more\nthan the healthy level of crudeness, intolerance, and aggressiveness,\nrevealing the divorce of the energy of culture from the energy of\neducation.\n\n\nThe result is that they have become a problem to themselves and a\nproblem to the nation.\n\n\nThese traits reveal a character in which, as our   Vedanta\n  puts it,   rajas   is till under the\ncontrol of   tamas   ; they need to go one step\nfurther in their spiritual growth by which their   rajas \n will be brought under the control of   sattva \n and their   tamas   under the control of\n  rajas   .\n\n\nOur older generation, with their largely feudal mental makeup, can\nhardly become fit example for our younger generation.\n\n\nFrom the lure of a dead past, therefore, our youths have to be\nsummoned to face the hardships and challenges of the living present and\nshoulder the responsible and creative roles of ushering in the delights\nof a glorious future.\n\n\nTheir energies, now functioning destructively like indisciplined\ndemental forces such as we experience in floods and earthquakes, need to\nbe made creative and responsible, by selfdiscipline through a\nsocially-oriented will. \n\n \n\nOur scientific technology is engaged in disciplining these\nelemental forces of nature to enhance human happiness and welfare.\n\n\nWe need a similar spiritual technology to discipline the energies\nof our youths to enhance their own and the  welfare.\n\n\n This is the ethical education of our children, by which they are\nmade to feel the weight of social responsibility for the rebuilding of their\nnational body-politic, by which they learn to have a creative and\nconstructive direction to their  enormous energies now\nexpressing largely in destructive and self-cancelling ways, and by which they\nnot only cease to be the despair, but become the shining hope, of the nation.\n \n\n\n   Tyaga  and  Seva  \n\n\n \n\nHuman excellence was the constant theme of Swami Vivekananda.\n\n\nHe will wel come this spirit of   rajas  \nin our younger generation today, but will also whisper the energy of his\n Vedantic  message into every one of them to raise his or her\nenergies to the higher level of   sattva   through\nselfdiscipline and cultivation of ethical and social awareness.\n\n\nThat energy then will find expression in a socially oriented will and\npurpose and dedication, with its constant and spontaneous mood and temper\nof   tyaga   and   seva   - -\nrenunciation and service. \n\n \n\nThis   tyaga   and   seva\n  is the first fruit of all true education and all true religion\nfrom which it issues spontaneously and naturally without the feeling of being\nforced to sacrifice and without expecting special external inducements to\nprop it up.\n\n\nHerein we see palpably the spiritual growth of man and the dynamic\nmarch of human evolution, beyond the organic level to the psychosocial\nlevel, as envisaged in twentiethcentury biology.\n\n\nWhere this dynamic evolutionary movement is absent, human life gets\nstuck up in worldliness and becomes stagnant.\n\n\nSuch stagnation is spiritual death, says  Vedanta  ;\nand it is more to be feared than physical death, by a species so high in\nthe scale of evolution as man.\n\n\n Sri   Ramakrishna exhorts man to avoid this\npitfall of spiritual death; says he: \n\n\n \" Live in   samsara   , or the world;\nbut allow not   samsara   , or worldliness, to get\ninto you; that will make you stagnant.\n\n\nA boat will be on the water; that is its natural place; but water\nshould not be allowed to get into the boat; that will render it stagnant and\nunfit for the purpose for which it is meant\"  . \n\n\n  The  Grihastha  Spiritually Growing into\nthe Citizen  \n\n \n\nIn this illustrative teaching,  Sri  Ramakrishna\nhas compressed the entire message of social ethics and practical religion.\n\n\nIt envisages the   grihastha   , or the\nhouseholder,  evolving into the citizen;  it exhorts the\nbiologically and physically conditioned man or woman to  grow into\nthe freedom and expansiveness of the spirituality of  citizenship,\nwhich manifests itself as renunciation and service,   tyaga \n and   seva   .\n\n\nThis is the type of men and women that we have to turn out in\nincreasing numbers in our society today.\n\n\nWhen we do so, we lay the foundations of the new democratic\nedifice of our nation on rock.\n\n\nBut, today, it has only sand for its base; and it is certain that as\nremarked by Jesus in his parable ( Matthew, 7, 2427) a building built\non sand cannot stand. \n\n\n  National Development : Economic  versus  Human\n \n\n \n\nToday we have to ask this very question; On what base are we\nto build up the structure of our Indian national life.\n\n\nThat structure is  already rising here, there, everywhere,\nthrough our mighty  developmental programmes in the field of\neducational expansion, scientific research, industrial and agricultural\ndevelopment, defence, and social welfare.\n\n\nBy the end of this century, we shall have solved many of our economic\nand social problems, the problems relating to the external environment in\nwhich human life is set.\n\n\nBut one problem will remain, and will become more intractable as we\nadvance in the solution of our environmental problems.\n\n\nIt relates to the great question as to what is the type of man that\nwill come out of all this development?\n\n\nIs he or she going to be a clever crooky person, whose increased\nknowledge tends to the exploitation of other people?\n\n\nA worldly individual, whose centre of \ninterest  is always in his or her little self inside, whose centre\nof gravity  is always in the profits and pleasures outside of himself\nor herself, and who has become stagnant in the world of sensate\nsatisfactions?\n\n\nOr is he or she to be a dynamic person continuing his or her\nevolution in the psychosocial levels, who is, accordingly, sensitive to\nhigher values and strives to realize them, and who has achieved, or its\n striving to achieve, the three-fold integrations referred to by the\nlate Bertrand Russell, namely  , integration between the self and\nsociety, between the self and nature outside, and between the diverse\nforces within the self itself? \n\n \n\nThis central problem of society, namely,  the problem of\nhuman excellence  , must be tackled from now onwards - - the type of\nmen and women that we want to see in the India that is emerging.\n\n\nIf that India is to continue her glorious past into a still more\nglorious future, she will have to achieve a synthesis of the tested and\nenduring elements of her own tradition with the finest elements of the modern\nWestern tradition.\n\n\n This meeting of East and West was achieved in a big way in Swami\nVivekananda  .\n\n\nReferring to Vivekananda in his  \" Life of Vivekananda\n\"  as the embodied unity of a nation containing a hundred\ndifferent nations ( p. 314 ) , Romain Rolland says ( ibid, p. 310 ) :\n\n\n  \" In the two words equilibrium and synthesis,  constructive genius  may be summed up.\n\n\nHe embraced all the paths of the spirit: the four  Yogas\n in their entirety, renunciation and service, art and science,\nreligion and action from the most spiritual to the most practical <*>\ndotted line</*>\n\n\nHe was the personification of the harmony of all human Energy.\"\n \n\n\n  The Meeting of East and West in Every Citizen  \n\n \n\nEvery Indian citizen today must achieve this synthesis in a\nmeasure in himself or herself.\n\n\nVivekananda exhorts every Indian to strive in this direction ( \n\" The Complete Work \"  , Vol. V. Eighth Editiion. P.\n29-30) :\n\n\n \" Can you become an occidental of occidentals in your\nspirit of equality, freedom, work and energy, and at the same time a Hindu to\nthe very backbone in religious culture and instincts?\n\n\nThis is to be done and we will do it.\n\n\n You are all born to do it.\n\n\nHave faith in yourselves; great convictions are the mothers of\ngreat deeds  .\n\n\nOnwards for ever - - sympathy for the poor, the downtrodden, even\nunto death this is our motto.\"  \n\n \n\nThis is the type of glory and greatness; that should descend upon\nmen and women in India, in general, and upon politicians and the members of\nthe administrative services of the Centre and the States, in particular will\nmake for the liberation of the spirit of service as a pervasive principle,\nlighting up the prevailing dark and dismal horizon of our nation and raising\nthe spiritual quality of the life of its citizens.\n\n\nTo go here and there to be spiritual is like going here and there to\nbreathe.\n\n\nIt is all  here and now  .\n\n\nWe have to realize that spirituality is not miracle-mongering, or\nmagic, or cheap mysticism; it is not to be sought merely in caves and forest\nbut that it is the birthright of one and all, and is to be cultivated in\nthe fields of one life and work, in the midst of its ups and downs.  \n\n\n  \" Better to flame forth for an instant than to smoke\naway for ages ! \"   \n\n \n\nOur people need to be inspired by this practical, ennobling, and\nrealizable ideal which Vivekananda has put before us in the modern age.\n\n\nHe exhorts us that it is far better to live for an ideal for an\ninstant than to lead the life of jellyfish existence.\n\n\nIn the following passage from the Mahabharata, uttered by queen\nVidula for the benefit of her son, King Sanjaya, we find this heroic\nmessage for all our youths to day (  Udyogaparva  , 131, 13):     Muhurtam jvalitam\nsreyo natu dhumayitam ciram - -  \n\n\n \" It is better flame forth for an instant than to smoke away\nfor ages!\"   \n\n \n\nSome of the great men of India, like Sankara and Vivekananda,\nlived  short but intense lives  .\n\n\nTheirs was an intense dedication to God and man, to God in man; and\nit changed the course of human history.\n\n\nIt is better to live intensely for an ideal and vision than to \nvegetate for long years in a humdrum existence.\n\n\nThis is a powerful  sentiment that can drive away the clouds\nof cynicism and frustration from the sky of India.\n\n\nEvery educated citizen has to teach himself or herself that he or she\nnot only is  in  India but is also  of  India and  for\n India, and is responsible for the  wellbeing.\n\n\nWe have to inspire ourselves with the conviction that we have been\ncalled upon  to be an instrument of our  purposes.\n\n\nWhat can be a greater  glory for man in India today than this,\nthat he or she is living in the most creative period of his or her  long history, and that he or she is privileged to contribute\nto it, big or small.\n\n\nWhen cynicism and frustration lay their cold hand of death on a\nperson, he or she is unable to respond to any higher value, and becomes\nsuspicious of all values, except  own self-interest. \n\n\n  Conclusion  \n\n \n\nWe have a long and impressive history and a very rich cultural\ntradition; and our great thinkers have plunged into life, and into the heart\nof experience, and given us visions of human excellence which can inspire any\nculture or civilization.\n\n\nBut, for centuries together, we failed to live up to these visions\nand became stagnant; and from that stagnation, we were rescued by our\ncontact with the modern Western culture.\n\n\nAs a result, for over a hundred years now, our society has been\npassing through the tremendous experience of an  awakening, a\npervasive renaissance, in the course of which we have  been\nreassessing our own inherited values and comparing them with the values which\nwe have received from the West.\n\n\nA small minority of great minds in India such as Mahatma Gandhi have\nbeen able to get a grip on our great national tradition and assimilate\ninto it the tested elements of the Western tradition; and they stand as\nthe great pathfinders for the rest of the Indian society, including the\nlarge number of those who have got stuck up in the weak and harmful and\nstagnant elements of their own national tradition, and of those others who\nhave become blinded by the cheap and equally harmful and stagnant elements of\nthe modern Western tradition; for this minority  has synthesized, in\nthemselves, the finest excellences of  character of both the East and\nthe West, and demonstrated to our nation that this modern transition in India\ncan be made purposive and fruitful, if the Indian child is given the guidance\nto understand the dynamic nature of the modern transition in India and to\nassimilate these two elements in his or her character.  <*> filled\ncircle</*>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0ceccf92-d698-4d72-90ba-f8be359a9cf8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.196574+00:00"}

1 \" is located near\nGuntkal-Secunderabad railway bridge.\n\n\n\" Sampling station - 2 \" is 1 km away from\n\" sampling station - 1 \" on down stream side, whereas\n\" sampling station - 3 \" is located at Gopal Darwaja about 2\nkm from sampling \" station - 1 \" .\n\n\n\" Sampling station - 4 \" is about 4 km down stream\nfrom the \"  Sampling  station - 1 \" and has a storm\nwater drainage ( about 0 030 cusecs ) in its vicinity.\n\n\n\" Sampling station - 5 \" is located just down stream\nside of water intake tower near paper mill.\n\n\n\" Sampling station - 6 \" is located near \nDhobi ghat  where large number of washers used the river for\nwashing the clothes.\n\n\nAt \" sampling station - 8 \" the water is abstracted\nfor public consumption ( for Gondipalle village ) .\n\n\nThe location of various sampling stations selected for this are given\nin figure 1.\n\n\nTo assess the extent of pollution during lean flows, winter months\nwere selected.\n\n\nGrab samples were collected from all the 8 locations initially once\nin a week for a period of one month and then once in a fortnight for a period\nof about 3 month.\n\n\nSamples were collected from a depth of 0.15 to 0.45 m below the water\nsurface.\n\n\nTemperature, pH and dissolved oxygen were determined directly at\nthe station itself.\n\n\nThe samples were transported to the laboratory immediately and    \n analysed in the laboratory for selected water quality\nparameters, like total alkalinity,    acidity \n , total hardness ( EDTA ) , sulphates, chemical oxygen demand ( COD )\nand biochemical oxygen demand ( B OD5 ) as per the standard\nprocedures ( APHA, 19 89 ) . \n\n\n  RESULT AND DISCUSSION  \n\n \n\nOver all, 44 samples were analysed for selected water quality\nparameters during the study period of 4 month.\n\n\nThe values of water quality parameters at all the 8 sampling stations\nare given in table 1.\n\n\nThe pH value at all sampling sites ranged between 7.0 to 7.5 and are\nclose to the standard limits ( 6.8 to 7.3 ) .\n\n\nThe temperature of water samples ranged between 25 to 29 <*>\ndegrees</*>C which also within permissible limits.\n\n\nThe temperature may not be more important for public supply, but\nin the polluted water it has profound effect on the dissolved oxygen,\n\" BOD \" and aquatic life.\n\n\nThe chloride concentration was found to vary from a minimum of 80\nmg / l to a maximum of 369 mg / l.\n\n\nThe presence of high levels of chlorides at site 4 is presumably an\nindication of pollution especially through domestic sewage.\n\n\nThe values of chlorides at all sampling location except at site 4 are\nwithin acceptable limits of 250 mg / l where as at site 4 it was 369 mg / l.\n\n\nTotal alkalinity values were in between 100 to 200 mg/l at\nsampling sites 4, 5 and 6 and between 130 to 275    mg / l at site 1.\n\n\nSulphate concentration of the river water samples ranged from 25 to\n35 mg / l at all sites, which is well within the permissible limits.\n\n\nTotal hardness ( EDTA ) of the water sample at sampling site 4\nwas found to be 760 mg / l.\n\n\nHardness ( EDTA ) values of all other samples were between 100 to 200\nmg / l.\n\n\nThese observations clearly indicate that the river water at\nsampling site 4 is polluted especially from extraneous sources and which\nmay also be corroborated by the fact that around 0.03 m2/s of drain\nwater flows into the river near the sampling station - 4. \n\n \n\nThe dissolved oxygen content of the river water at all sites\nranged between 7 and 8.1 mg / l which is more than the required value ( 5.0\nmg / l ) .\n\n\nLarge number of fish population were also observed at all the\nsampling sites except at site 4.\n\n\nFive day BOD at 20 <*> degrees</*>C of river water varied from 5 mg /\nl to 32 mg / l.\n\n\n\" COD \" of the river water samples varied from 20 to\n280 mg / l, Moderate BOD and COd moderate to high values indicate possible\npollution especially nonbiodegradable organics, perhaps from the treated\ndischarge of the paper mill.\n\n\nHowever, the test for MPN has not yielded any positive result perhaps\ndue to presence of some inhibitors. \n\n\n  WATER QUALITY INDEX  \n\n \n\nWater quality and its suitability for public consumption can\nalso be assessed by determining the \" WQI \" of river water\nunder consideration.\n\n\nThe \" WQI \" may be defined as a rating reflecting\nthe composite influence on the overall quality of a number of quality,\ncharacteristics or water quality parameters ( Tiwari and Ali, 1988 ) .\n\n\nIn the present study, out of 6 different methods suggested by Bottom\n et al  . ( 1978 ) , weighted arithmetic index is adopted for\ncalculation of WQI.\n\n\nAccording to Ott ( 1978 ) calculation of \" WQI \"\nconsists of 2 fundamental steps, namely : ( a ) calculation of quality rating\nfor each water quality parameter used in the index, and ( b ) Aggregating of\nthese sub indicies into overall index.\n\n\nThe quality rating ( or sub indices ) q1 corresponding to\nthe \" ith parameter P1 \" is a number of\nreflecting the relative value of this parameter in the polluted water with\nrespect to its standard or permissible value.\n\n\nQuality rating may be obtained from q1 - - 100 [ (\nV1 <*> approximate-sign</*> V10 ) / ( S1 -\nV10 ) ] Where V1 - - Measured value of \"\nith parameter \" in the polluted water under consideration\nV10 - - The ideal value of this parameter in pure water,\nS1 - -\n\n\nStandard value for the \" ith parameter \" .\n\n\n \n\nIn the above equation the sign ( <*> approximate-sign</*> )\nindicates the numerical value of the difference, ignoring its algebraic\nsign.\n\n\nThe overall arithmetic \" WQI \" is calculated by\naggregating the quality rating q1 linearly.  \n\n \n\nIn the present study, 6 water quality parameters, namely pH, DO,\nBOD5, chlorides, total hardness ( E DTA) and total alkalinity were\nconsidered for computing WQI and unit weight ( W1 ) of each\nparameter is obtained depending upon its weightage ( Table 2 ) .\n\n\nThe standard permissible values of various parameters  for drinking purposes is considered as recommended by Indian\nCouncil of Medical Research ( ICMR ) .\n\n\nThe WQI of river water thus calculated is also given in table 2.\n\n\nIn addition, WQI of all 8 sampling stations were calculated to\nassess the variation in river water quality.\n\n\nWQI of all 8 individual stations are given in table 3.\n\n\nThe permissible limit of \" WQI \" for drinking water\nis 100 ( Tiwari and Mishra, 1985 ) .\n\n\nTiwari and Ali ( 1988 ) made a preliminary survey of water quality\nindex of 18 Indian rivers and found the \" WQI \" value\nranging from 97 to 2051.\n\n\nThe WQI obtained in present study for Tunghabadra river is 230.\n\n\nKudesia ( 1980 ) reported a \" WQI \" of 174 for\nTungabhadra river near Bellary.\n\n\nA WQI of 230 implies that there is a further deterioration in\nwater quality of river Tungabhadra compared to that at Bellary which is on\nthe upstream side ( approx 150 km ) .\n\n\n\" WQI \" at individual stations ranged from 202 to\n240, suggesting the possible pollution of the river water.\n\n\nHigh \" WQI \" suggest that the water requires to be\ntreated before supplying for public consumption. \n\n\n  CONCLUSION  \n\n \n\nBased on the water quality data obtained from this investigation.\n\n\nIt becomes clear that the water requires treatment before\nsupplying for public consumptiion.\n\n\nComputed WQI also implies possible pollution of river water.\n\n\nHowever, a comprehensive programme of monitoring the water quality\nfor longer period may further improve the understanding of the river system\nand also the quality of river. \n\n\n REFERENCE \n\n\nAPHA. 1989.\n\n\n\" Standard methods for the examination of water and\nwastewater ( 18 edn ) \" .\n\n\n\" American Public Health Association \" , New\nYork.\n\n\nBottom, P.W., J.C.

{"text": "Remembering   ISAAC ASIMOV \n\n\nby MUKUL SHARMA  \n\n\n  Part I :  \n\n\n  The Man  \n\n \n\n \" Way back in about 1960 I wrote that there were three\nsteps to salvation.\n\n\nThe first one was speech.\n\n\nThen came writing.\n\n\nAnd then came printing.\" \n\n\n- -  Isaac Asimov  , from an interview with the author\n\n\n \n\nAnd then came reading. \n\n \n\nWhen I was a child and the world was a little younger and there\nwere no communication satellites over my head, my father accidentally\nintroduced me to science fiction ( SF).\n\n\nHe was a member of a club where children were only allowed to eat\npotato chips or swim.\n\n\nIt was a stupid rule but I diligently did both till the day an ear\ninfection made him maroon me in the confines of the  mournful\nand melancholic library full of dusty old books and duster, older people\nreading them. \n\n \n\nI remember I was ten or 11 and kept walking around that maze of\ngloomy shelves, one finger tracing the tops of those tomes, one thought\nracing through my mind: How do I get out of this place?\n\n\nThere were no \" Hardy \" Boys books and no \"\nSecret Sevens \" , so, with indifference, I picked up something\ncalled Best SF 1 or 2 or 3.\n\n\nI like to think that was a small contribution to the fourth step to\nsalvation.\n\n\nMine at least. \n\n \n\nToday I have lots of SF anthologies and lots of heroes.\n\n\nNot persons who peopled those stories but people who conjured up\nthose persons.\n\n\nOne such is \" Isaac Asimov \" with whom \nhad a heavy, one-sided, love-hate relationship.\n\n\nI loved him for the way he wrote; I hated him for my not being able\nto write like that.\n\n\nApparently  not alone.\n\n\nWhen I was talking to the new-wave spokesperson Thomas Disch - -\nthe SF author  \" Newsweek \"  described as the most\nformidably gifted unfamous American writer ( and considered to be one of\nthe  most tough and unbrokering critics ) - - a few years\nago, he said,  \" I think Asimov is writing the  Foundation \nthings exactly as though it were still 1952 and I think his vision of the\nfuture has remained in place.\"  \n\n \n\nHow many of ours have? \n\n \n\nMine took a magical leap forward four years ago when Mannika\nChopra of the  \" Saturday Times \"  called me from\nNew Delhi to ask if  like to interview the man. \n\n \n\n \" You're kidding.\"  I said. \n\n \n\n \" No way,\"  she replied,  \" the good folk\nat the USIS have arranged it all.\n\n\nBrush up on a couple of laws of robotics and come on over.\" \n\n\n \n\nBut when the higher-than-tech equipment had been set up, the\nsatellite links established, the audience hushed into awe, and Asimov was\nready across a transpacific silence to receive the first question, I had\namen stuck deep in my throat. \n\n \n\n end.  \n\n \n\n ME: \n\n\nEr <*> dotted line</*>\n\n\nTen years ago you wrote that nothing of any importance had\nhappened to you.\n\n\nHow could you say that and what would you consider happening to you\nother than world fame, money, cult following, and so many hundred book titles\nbehind you? \n\n  HIM: \n\n\nI haven't traveled; I haven't climbed \nmountains; I haven't met famous people, and I haven't had a narrow escape\nfrom death.\n\n\nFor the most part I simply sit at my typewriter and write and\nexercise my imagination.  \n\n \n\nLucky us.\n\n\nThose mental calisthenics have yielded a two-volume guide to  plays, a commentary on Kipling and Byron, a guide to the\nBible, annotated versions of  \" Don Juan, \" \"\nParadise Lost \"  , and  \" \nTravels \"  , a treasury of humor, a history of physics, a\ntreatise on the music of Gilbert and Sullivan, a chronology of science and\ndiscovery, and, of course, all things psychohistorical in a galaxy far away\ncalled the Foundation Tetralogy.\n\n\nNot to mention the three-and-a-half laws of robotics because,\n \"  added,\"  he said,  \" another law in my\nrecent novel  \" Robots and Empire \"  , which I call\nthe  Law which is a more fundamental law than the first one (\n ` A robot may not harm a human being, or, through an action, allow a\nhuman being to come to harm'  ) .\n\n\nThis law generalizes to say that a robot may not harm  humanity\n directly or through an action.\"  \n\n \n\nAnd in between Asimov wrote 467 titles.\n\n\nOften three of them simultaneously.\n\n\n traveling light?  \n\n  ME: \n\n\nYou mentioned categorically that you don't travel.\n\n\nBut supposing you decided suddenly that you wanted to go\nsomewhere, where would you go?\n\n\nWould you, for instance, plan to come to India?\n\n\nOr is it too far away and would involve a long plane journey, which\nyou are not particularly fond of? \n\n  HIM: \n\n\n taken ships in my time to Europe and \ntaken trains across the United States, so I can, on rare occasions, take a\nfew trips.\n\n\nIf ever I decide to retire and before I die, I suppose the first\nthing I would want to do would be to visit the Soviet Union because I was\nborn there and it always strikes me that I    would like to see the town in\nwhich I was born and which I left 65 years ago and never returned.\n\n\nCertainly it would be interesting to go to India as well.\n\n\nBut I must admit this is more likely to remain a dream than become a\nreality.  \n\n\n  Part II: \n\n\n  The Legacy  \n\n \n\nAccepting the Grand Master Nebula Award in 1986 for a  achievement in science fiction ( see pages 34-36 ) ,\nAsimov said,  \" Anyone made Grand Master in his lifetime is ipso\nfacto a member of the Science Fiction Hall of Fame after he has left us for\nthe Great and Perpetual Convention in the sky.\"  \n\n \n\nNow that Asimov has left us for whatever other things may be\nlying about in all the plurality of heavens and earths undreamt of by  philosophers, isn't it time to ask why this Russian kid who\ntaught himself to read English at the age of five while consuming pulp\nscience fiction in his  candy shop in Brooklyn, New York,\nwas being so prescient and, later, modest? \n\n \n\n \" If you don't mind, I would like to say I  do \nfeel humble, and I  am  honored, and I owe it to lots of other\npeople - - especially the great John W. Campbell, Jr., who drove me both mad\nand to the heights.\"  \n\n \n\nTwenty-eight-year-old SF kingmaker Campbell, editor of \nAstounding Science-Fiction  , was only mildly threatened on June 21,\n1938, when our terrified 18-year-old kid made, as Asimov said,  \" his\nawesome pilgrimage to his office.\" \n\n\nHe had a story called  \" Marooned Off Vesta,\"  which\nsaw 17 rejection slips before making it into the light of print.\n\n\nCampbell read him a quote from  essays - -\nsomething about how, if human beings could see the stars only once in a\nthousand years, they would get a big kick out of it.\n\n\nAs a result in September 1941  \" Nightfall\"  appeared,\nconsidered by many - - but not its author - - to be his best piece of short\nscience fiction. \n\n \n\nIn 1990  \" Nightfall \"  appeared again;\nthis time in book-length form, co-authored by another science fiction writer.\n\n\nRobert Silverberg.\n\n\nThe reception it received can be considered a seminal, though\noblique, commentary on  accomplishment and heritage.\n\n\nAt least as far as his science fiction is concerned. \n\n \n\nThe book was savaged; the co-author called a  \"\nsub-contractor.\"  \n\n \n\nWhat happened? \n\n \n\nSimple.\n\n\nAsimov had shown he had staying power.\n\n\nWhile other major league authors such as Theodore Sturgeon, Ray\nBradbury, Judith Merril, Walter Miller, Jr., Alfred Bester, John Wyndham,\nAlgis Budrys, Damon Knight, James Blish, Robert Sheckley, Joanna Russ, and\nHarlan Ellison either gradually tapered off or completely stopped writing.\n\n\nAsimov just kept going.\n\n\nAlso, other top rankers even started opting out of the field itself.\n\n\nSamuel Delany is now head of the department of comparative\nliterature at the University of Massachusetts where most of his writing is\nnonfiction; J.G.

{"text": "Freedom of Press   \n\n \n\nPress plays very important part in our life.\n\n\nIt    provides   us newspaper which\ngives us important & valuable news of all countries.\n\n\nAs we know that the word  ` NEWS'  can be derived from\nNorth, East, West, South.\n\n\nIt means press gives us report of these  things  daily.\n\n\nPress gives us news of sports, industries, agriculture, accidents,\nachievement of our citizens, new establishment of company, firms,\ncultural activity, investment & saving means, mainly about political    controversy   , leaders, businessman etc. \n\n \n\nEvery day each    person is  \nthirsty for news & eager for information  an\nimportant medium which would communicate it  to  all of them.\n\n\nPress gives important current    events  \nof world, country,  Taluka  , district, etc.\n\n\nEditors express their views in a very forceful language    through   newspaper provided to us by press.\n\n\nIn press, there are also other    writers \n who have made an indepth study of particular issues & who gives us their\nconsidered views on subjects concerned.\n\n\n   Sports   page is also an absorbing\nreading, gives us accurate news about    the   world\naround.\n\n\nPress has a very ancient past in this country & a very tradition of\njournalism.  \n\n \n\nFor industrial & commercial firms, press is an important channel\nof advertisement.\n\n\nCouples intending to get    married   &\nwishing to insert  an  advertisement in newspaper would also be\nadvantageous of press.\n\n\nPress also    provides   us sensational\nnews or reports from crimes, murder, robberies, rapes which makes us very\ndepressed by reading but gives us cynical view of human nature. \n\n \n\nI think that there is a great freedom to press as press can\nfreely    divulge   any secret matters about\npoliticians, ministers, actors, directors, industrialists, scientists,\narchaeologist    whether   the    secrets   may be good or bad, advantageous or\ndepressing  . \n\n\nPress also tells us about    bollywood \n stars, sportsman.\n\n\nBut for collecting all this information about various parts of world\npress    reporters have   to take very\ngreat efforts.\n\n\nThey have to make travel to various cities, world countries etc. \n\n \n\nThough there is freedom to press in various matters but there are\nobviously some restrictions must be there on press.\n\n\nIt is in the pockets of rich people.\n\n\nSo big    businessmen   mainly\npoliticians,    industrialists   make use\nof press by purchasing them.\n\n\nTherefore, they publish wrongful information also to save themselves\n& to put others in difficulty.\n\n\nIt is right that freedom is given to press to publish & expose all\n   secrets   of politicians but they are\nsomewhere, restricted  for  e.g.    take  \nthe case of  ` Hawala'  racket.\n\n\nIn this racket, when CBI says that BJP is involved in  `\nHawala'  then the press purchased by   \nCongress   make too much comments on BJP in the newspaper & tried to\nshow how    Congress   is pure &    uncorrupted   like  ` river Ganga'\n & in the same way in other newspaper BJP also make & pass the same\ncomment on    Congress   &  \n tried   to show    clearly the integrity\n  of their group as elections came nearer.\n\n\nBut at least there will be freedom to press to expose the names of\nother politicians &    industrialists \n involved in  ` Hawala racket'  & like other news.\n\n\nPress also publishes about activity of Tamil militants &    Sri Lanka.  \n\n\nIt also exposes our    Prime Minister\n  about  ` Hawala racket'  .\n\n\nIt also gives information about  `  Chandanchor\nVirappan'   in Karnataka.\n\n\nThese are some of the merits of press. \n\n \n\nApart from this, there are some demerits of press also.\n\n\n   Sometimes   , press can publish\nsome wrong information also it    hurts   the\nprestige of some people of high status.\n\n\nEvery day when we started to read the newspaper there are majority\n   number   of news from accidents, murder, suicide\n   etc.,   which makes us very depressed.\n\n\nPress has given such a freedom that it can expose any wrong &\nconfusing news  . \n\n\nSo press must have some type of restrictions. \n\n \n\nI think press has given   \nindefinite   & unrestricted freedom is given to press for giving\nall kinds of news from    all over   the\ncountry. \n\n\nIt is important from point of   \nindustrialists   to give advertisement about their products & young\nstudents to give    applications   for job\nin    newspapers   in response to an\nadvertisement. \n\n \n\nPress can make best to their efforts to provide us valuable\ninformation of important    happenings   of\nthe world today.\n\n\nBut it is my    advice   to press that\nthey    should   not allow other persons to\npurchase them by money by rich persons.\n\n\nI want to    thank the   press for\nproviding us valuable & rich information. \n\n\n\n\n   Should Mothers Go to Work  ?  \n\n If sometimes mothers go away from us we    feel \n helpless.\n\n\nBecause for every purpose we want mother.\n\n\nMother is our birth giver.\n\n\nWithout mother we can't    Come   into the\nworld.\n\n\nWithout mother our  work is not to be done.\n\n\nFor each purpose, each work, each cause we want mother. \n\n \n\nWhen mothers go to work we are  alone.\n\n\nWe think that mother should not go to work.\n\n\nEvery moment we want her.\n\n\nFor small purposes we  depend upon our\nmother. \n\n \n\nTo day mothers  are free.\n\n\nSociety has given them equal staus.\n\n\nBut once upon a time there was no freedomf for women.\n\n\nThey can't learn in the school.\n\n\nOnly men were allowed to go to  School and  learn.\n\n\nWomen lived only in house.\n\n\nThey should not come outside. \n\n \n\nOnly cook  and have to  take care\n   of   their children .\n\n\nThere was no choice without it.\n\n\nThey didn't learn    in a   school. \n\n \n\nThen some time after, a great man, Mahatma Jyotiba Fule  hated this type of situation.\n\n\nHe    ignored   this type of\ntradition.\n\n\nThey wanted to teach women.\n\n\nBut society haven't given them this type  of  rights.\n\n\nBut he started firstly his wife Savitribai Fule.\n\n\nWhen she learned  herself  she started teaching girls. \n\n \n\nThere was revolution in women.\n\n\nThen slowly women liberation started.\n\n\nThey are    rvolting against  \nmen in every field.\n\n\nThey    showed   us that they are not\n\" down with \" with men.\n\n\nThus revolution  going  on. \n\n \n\nBut in revolutionary time some bad effects were going on.\n\n\nMother and Father go to work.\n\n\nThey leave their children in house.\n When mother &\nfather go to work children were  alone.\n\n\nAny one was not there with them for speaking. \n\n \n\nThey    think   that when mother\nand father  return  home they can enjoy with\nthem.\n\n\nBut when mother and father come  home they were so    tired   .\n\n\nThere was no time    to   speak with the\nchieldren.\n\n\nSo that  they didn't give any attention to the\nchildren. \n\n \n\nFor this cause children became lonely.\n\n\nThey became  risky  and alone from their parents.\n\n\nThey became angry    with   their mother.\n\n\nThey hate them.\n\n\nThey didn't like that their mother  should live with\nthem.\n\n\nChildren wanted that mother should care about them.\n\n\nBut mother  couldn't leave her work. \n\n \n\nSome    women   go to work for\nfamily needs.\n\n\nAnd some    women   go to work  to show    pride   in society. \n\n \n\nBut for their working children become bad.\n\n\nThey are going on making bad    habits   .\n\n\nThey also go  in  for  drugs.\n\n\nSome children do not learn   \nproperly   in School.\n\n\nThey go on failing    because   no one\nwas there to care about them.\n\n\nIf the child asks money to their parents they give money without\nchecking for what purpose he wants money.\n\n\nSo the children became    spoilt \n . \n\n \n\nSo there are bad effects of them.\n\n\nBut when mother found that her child is ina bad    company   there was no time.\n\n\nIn  the  past    women   should\nonly care about her family and children  and men should work to\nearn money only  and take care of his family.\n\n\nSo mother  had   no  time to \ntake  care of her child. \n\n  \n\n \n\n But    women   also\ntake care to their children with working. \n\n\n <- > Woman's         revolution   like men.\n\n\nMen also have to work like women.\n\n\nMen have to help  women.\n\n\nWhen mother is not in house father would have to take care of\nchildren.\n\n\nFather would have to look after the children that what\nthey do in absence of parents.\n\n\nThey ask about it to them. \n\n \n\nMother would also have to look after children.\n\n\nWithout working only would have to give more and more importance to\nthe children.\n\n\nMother would take care of the children with working also. \n\n \n\nToday also people haven't like that woman would work because\nthey think that any one would not care about her house & children.\n\n\nSo  woman don't work.\n\n\nSo one question    arises   that mothers\nshould go to work ? \n\n \n\nBut  she should work also.\n\n\nFrom this question she    has   to come\nout.\n\n\nBecause    nothing is  \npossible in  the  world.\n\n\nSometimes we    think   that something\nis possible, but it is hard but not impossible. \n\n \n\nIn house  when mother is learned, literate\n her children    are \n also intelligent.\n\n\nSo women have to learn & work for our scociety.\n\n\nAnd for   that  show the society she  also\n have  to  work. \n\n\n\n\n   Impact of Science on   \nHuman Life     \n\n \n\nScience is systematical knowledge passed down from generation to\ngeneration.\n\n\nAt times it has taken the form of a search for truth, at others it\nhas been translated in to technology  - -\n\n\nScience and technology, together, have brought about sea-    change   in our lives during the present Century.\n\n\nThe    change   has been in a large - -\nmeasure, for the better, but it has also posed some serious problem for\nhumanity. \n\n \n\nThe science gives us lot up advantages and also lot    of   disadvantages.\n\n\nSpecially we look to advantages  particularly  the science is\nvery  useful to us.\n\n\nThanks to science we have many marvellous machines which have taken\nthe drudgery out of work.\n\n\n   Factories   have made a variety\nof essential goods available to multitudes at low costs.\n\n\n   Different   sources of energy\nhave been - - tapped to run machines.\n\n\nOur advanced - - technology has helped us in better management of\nwater and other resources. \n\n \n\n   On the   other hand the progress in\nthe field of communication has helped us travel faster, transport our goods\nover longer  distance and send or receive messages at unbelievable\nspeed.\n\n\nScience has created madicines which can prevent or cure - - dreaded\n   diseases   .\n\n\nIt has increased our life span and has made our lives pain-free.\n\n\nIt has given us miraculous    operational\n  - - techniques whereby organs like kidneys are transplated.\n\n\nScience has    revolutionised  \nevery aspect of our life, whether it be agriculture, the home, entertainment,\n   domestic   comforts and leisure.\n\n\nBut this only one    sad   of the story.\n\n\n   These   all things gives us only\nscience.\n\n\nThe main thing is todays    persons  \ncannot  spend our one second without science ( technology )\n\n\n \n\nWhen we try to think in a   \ndifferent view   about science.\n\n\nThere is lot    of   \ndisadvantages also    responsible   to\nhuman life.\n\n\nThe two world wars, the Vietnam war, the Gulf war have shown how\ndestructive science can be.\n\n\nAtom bombs, guided missiles,    chemical \n and biological weapons, even long    range  \nstar-war technology have taken mankind to the brink of a global distructions.\n\n\nThe increase in materialism and the lack of spirituality have\ndistroyed the mental and physical health of man.\n\n\n   Entertainment   has\ndegenerated to the level of the cheap and the vulgur and mean has become too.\n\n\nSuperficial and bereft of human values. \n\n \n\nFactories and the use of machines have led to pollution of air,\nwater and land.\n\n\nIndiscriminate and prolonged use of fertilizers has led to the \n  destruction   of the soil.\n\n\nQuicker means of transport have increased the frequency of\naccidents.\n\n\nThere has been a steep rise in population due to the decrease in\ninfant mortality and death rates.\n\n\nSuch indiscriminate  population growth has put immense\nstrain on the exiting food    supply   and on\nother  resources. \n\n \n\nMuch, therefore, depends on how  exactly science\nis put to use.\n\n\nIn thoughtful hands, science can become a tool for the creation of a\nheaven on earth, but in the wrong hands it can become a deadly weapon of \n  destruction   which could lead to total\nannihilation of all life on earth. \n\n \n\nThe man become very    lazy   today\nbecause science will give us lot    of      facilities   .\n\n\nThe    persons   did not know how to\nuse science and technology in our life.\n\n\nSome     persons  \ncannot spend for life without science and technology    .\n \n\n\nToday  become very    necessary\n  to learn how to use and how to    maintain\n  the Science and Technology.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9a1d8c15-c7f7-4d42-8508-140750dbf12e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.200078+00:00"}

she was tough, tougher than any of them. \n\n \n\nEvery now and then Chaddhasaab had to chide her,  \" Now,\nmadam, be Indian, this is Bharat;  no longer in London (\nLondon for them meant anywhere in England ) and things are done with a lot\nof sentiment.\n\n\nWhen your daughter comes home,  all be there to do an\n  arti   for her <*> dotted line</*> for isn't she\nthe  Lakshmi  of your house, madam.\"  \n\n \n\n \" Bhaisaab,\"  Ammu laughed raucously,  \"\nall these days I thought I was the  Lakshmi  of this abode,\nhow can you dislodge me <*> dotted line</*>?\"  \n\n \n\nChaddhasaab hee-hawed as the others joined him in the laughter.\n\n\n \"  to inform us, madam, of the time the plane\narrives,  be there to receive her with music and garlands of\nflowers.\"  \n\n \n\nAmmu tried to work up some enthusiasm for the sake of the\ncommunity elders.\n\n\nBut she knew her daughter, Renuka, very modern and all that,\nwouldn't care for this reception from her  friends.\n\n\nRenuka would wear her hoity-toity expression, and of course, blame\nher mother for the  \" vulgar show\"  . \n\n \n\nWhat could Ammu do?\n\n\nThe elders considered her as their comunity leader, maybe because\nshe was England-returned, or spoke better English than any one of them, or\nbecause she could bully everyone without fear. \n\n \n\nIt was the younger  ` set'  who didn't know what\nto make of her.\n\n\nTo the servants of the locality, especially the  \nchokras   , she was neither   desi   nor\n  angrez   , man nor woman.\n\n\nHer abusive language made them snigger uncomfortably. \n\n \n\nShankar, the first time he encountered Ammu, was so\nterrified by her that he urinated in his pants. \n\n \n\nActually it happened at dusk on a Sunday evening.\n\n\nAmmu was taking her usual constitutional around the central lawn.\n\n\nShe was about to turn in when she saw this strange youth sidling\nagainst the wall.\n\n\nHe seemed to be urinating. \n\n \n\nHer first instinct was that he was an intruder, and as a\ncommunity welfare-in-charge, she thought it her duty to question him.\n\n\nWhen she moved in his direction, however, the boy started running.\n\n\nNow her suspicions were fully roused and she was determined to\ngive him hot chase. \n\n \n\nWith her short grey hair streaking on her narrow forehead, she\nsprinted like a Lhasa Apso after him.\n\n\n \" Chor, chor,\"  she screamed as she panted for\nbreath, forgetting her heart conditions.\n\n\nShe looked as though she was going to collapse. \n\n \n\nThe boy, however, was in full form; he wove in and out of the\nblock of flats and it was obvious Ammu was no match for him.\n\n\nThe few elders who had joined the run tried to stop her but in vain.\n\n\n \n\nShe led them on for   ` spied'  the\nboy as he plunged into the flat opposite hers.\n\n\nAmmu followed him into the flat. \n\n \n\nShe didn't know Mrs. Gupta very well, but she explained the\nsituation to her.\n\n\nMrs. Gupta looked bored, as though she wanted to fall asleep.\n\n\nBut Ammu wouldn't budge; she was prepared to wait.\n\n\nFinally, Shankar came out at his  bidding and stood\nwith a sullen expression on his face.\n\n\nAmmu stared at him and asked him curtly,  \" What were you\nhanging out there for?\"  \n\n \n\n \" I was urinating,\"  he confessed. \n\n \n\n \" You know you can be whipped for that ?\n\n\nI won't tolerate any of this nonsense.\n\n\nMrs. Gupta, you should keep him in control.\"  \n\n \n\nThe next day the story went round the block that shankar had\nurinated through sheer fear on seeing Ammu.\n\n\nSome of his friends claimed that she had the same terrifying effect\non most of them. \n\n \n\nWhile Ammu herself took the stand that Shankar had\ndeliberately committed nuisance in a public place.\n\n\nShe kept a close watch on him, making a note of his movements and\nregarding him in general as a potential criminal - - until one day, the\nsituation changed drastically for Ammu. \n\n \n\nThis change  going to narrate now took place two\nweeks after the Great Chase. \n\n \n\n  RENUKA   had come\nunanounced in the middle of the night.\n\n\nThere could be neither a reception nor an   arti \n .\n\n\nShe missed nothing, however, for she was used to \nways. \n\n \n\nHardly had she been there for two days when Ammu started nagging\nher.\n\n\nDo this, do that, don't do this and don't do that.\n\n\nThe fact that they had no servant in the house made things too\nirksome for them. \n\n \n\nThe elders did a belated   arti   for the\ngirl, welcoming her as the  Lakshmi  of the house, at which\nAmmu brayed in drunken laughter as  taken to heavy drinking\nsince  arrival.\n\n\nRenuka was fed up of the whole business of homecoming. \n\n \n\nThe arguments grew more and more violent, until one day there was\na fight between mother and daughter.\n\n\nWhat happened in the dining-room that evening of August 12 no one was\nto know, there were no witnesses. \n\n \n\nIt was only between the two of them, locked in unquenchable\nhatred, two people who were so intimately connected in a mother-daughter\nrelationship, yet had clashed in the fashion of bitter enemies. \n\n \n\nHowever, what everyone came to know was that because of  visit Ammu had suffered a heart attack.\n\n\nThe elders came immediately, of course, for Renuka knew nothing about\nhospitals in Delhi. \n\n \n\nShe stood around stricken with guilt, not able to help in any\nway.\n\n\nAmmu had a regular taxi driver, a   sardarji \n , at the taxistand under the cassia tree. \n\n \n\nHe now came with his mate, and between them, they carried Ammu to\nthe taxi.\n\n\nThe   sardarji   knew  ways\npretty well and he now asked Renuka as he started the egine,  \" Hope\n not her drinking that has brought on this attack?\" \n\n\nRenuka had nothing to say, she only sulked. \n\n \n\nIn the hospital Ammu was twitching in semi-coma on the first\nnight.\n\n\nThe doctors put her through all the tests and declared there was\nno danger to her life.\n\n\nThey put her on a strict  regimen - - no cigarettes,\nno alcohol. \n\n \n\nThe two weeks in the hospital seemed like a hundred years to\nAmmu, though she did flirt outrageously with a duty doctor one day, a shy\nyoung man. \n\n \n\nRenuka was chafing too, for  to get back to her job\nin London.\n\n\nHer leave was coming to an end.\n\n\nAs soon as Ammu was discharged, Renuka wanted to make her departure.\n\n\nBut there was a relapse of some kind and the doctors said they would\nkeep the patient for another three days for observation. \n\n \n\nNow, this set Ammu worrying about the flat and Renuka. \n\n \n\nIn all this, she had not forgotten the urinating boy.\n\n\nLying in the hospital bed, she gave all her thought to him.\n\n\nShe closed her eyes and tried to recapture those odd features. \n\n \n\nHadn't she thought there was something primitive about him the\nvery first time  set eyes on him?\n\n\nIt was his eyes that had struck her as being abnormal.\n\n\nHe never seemed to blink them and she could have been staring at a\npair of cold stones. \n\n \n\nAmmu gave an involuntary shudder at the memory.\n\n\nBut why hadn't Renuka come at her usual visiting hour?\n\n\nIt was past six  .\n\n\nShe shuddered again as she saw, in a hallucinatory flash, Renuka\ngagged and bound in the lonely flat and Shankar ransacking the almirahs,\nthrowing   saris  and clothes around. \n\n \n\n \"  Ma  , you look tired,\"  came\n voice as in a dream and Ammu came back to consciousness,\ntrying to register where she was. \n\n \n\n \"  Ma  ,  brought you some\nnice soup today.\n\n\nJust tell me how it tastes, OK?\"  \n\n \n\n \" You made it for me, darling?\"  she said, her\nbad thoughts receding at the sight of  soft youthful looks.\n\n\nShe was already feeling a lot better and had forgiven Renuka for what\n said the other day in the dining-room. \n\n \n\nI suppose every child at some time or the other has said what\nRenuka had accused her of.\n\n\nHow could a mother not love her child?\n\n\nEven in her most monstrous, hateful moments, Ammu had discovered\nwithin herself this attachment for her child. \n\n \n\nShe, Renuka, had hurt Ammu very badly at times, she brought\nanyone home, had married that African boy, Salim, without even introducing\nhim to her, and had broken up with him recently.\n\n\nWhat was all this?\n\n\nWhen she had asked Renuka,  \" What went wrong dear?\" \n\n\nThe answer was,  \" What went wrong with  ,\n ma  ? \"  \n\n \n\n \" How is everything at the flat, darling.\n\n\nAnd who made this soup?\" \n\n\nAmmu could smell the aroma of the soup as it was poured into the cup.\n\n\nShe felt homesick for the flat, the dining-room with the sideboard\ngroaning with all the flowered crockery  transported from her\nhome in Surrey. \n\n \n\n \" The doctor says  to be discharged,\n ma  .\n\n\nSo  be home tomorrow.\"  \n\n \n\n \"  good news,\"  mumbled Ammu.\n\n\n \"  longing to get back.\n\n\n you have been eating, darling?\n\n\n a bad mother, aren't I?\"  \n\n \n\n \"  an angel,  ma  .\n\n\nBesides,  this new chap.\n\n\nWon't you taste your soup now,  getting cold.\" \n\n\n \n\nAmmu had slid back against her pillows.\n\n\n \" So tired, I don't know why.\n\n\nAnd so drowsy <*> dotted line</*>\"  \n\n \n\n  THE   next morning, Renuka\nwas really considerate to her mother, helping her into the

{"text": "Rs. 40  cr.  for Holiday Inn hotel in Delhi\n \n\n\n Need to review bonanza for Lalit Suri \n\n\n By <@AS> MANECK DAVAR {#} \n\n \n\nIn the capital, there is one identifiable monument to the\nrapine of financial institutions and banks.\n\n\nThis edifice was initially the product of illegal largesse, and then\nhas been constructed brick by brick by public funds wantonly granted - - an\nexample of how the heads of financial institutions and one bank have\nflouted banking norms and pumped in good money after bad to shore up the\nfinancially diseased structure.\n\n\nThis monolith is Lalit  'Sumitomo'  Suri's Holiday Inn\nhotel. \n\n \n\nMr. Suri, when he decided to go into the hotel business, roped in\nthree financial institutions and one bank to help finance his fantasy.\n\n\nThey were S.S. Nadkarni's Industrial Development Bank of India (\nIFBI), N. Vaghul's Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (\nICICI) and D.N. Davar's Industrial Finance Corporation of India ( IPCI) and\nPremjit Singh's Bank of Baroda ( BoB).\n\n\nTogether, these institutions have advanced over Rs. 40  crores\n worth of finances, on flimsy and doubtful security and even after\nthe borrower's inability or intransigency in   \nrepaying   earlier instalments. \n\n \n\nThis huge sum has been advanced in a period of little more than\nthree years to Suri's Bharat Hotels which has built the Holiday Inn.\n\n\nToday, there is a real apprehension, with losses accumulating to Rs.\n11.09  crore     up to   March 31,\n1989, that the loans advanced are in jeopardy.\n\n\nThere has been an official recommendation by the Public Accounts\nCommittee ( PAC) of Parliament that the hotel be taken over and publicly\nauctioned for breach of contract.\n\n\nIf that happens, all that the institutions will be left with, will be\nforks and spoons, pots and pans, cots and mattresses and airconditioners and\nlifts.\n\n\nFor all these loans have been advanced, for the most part, against\nthe movable property of the hotel. \n\n \n\nThe break-up of the financing provided by the institutions and\nBank of Baroda is as follows:- \n\n \n\n- - On November 1, 1985, Rs. 8  crores  is handed\nover to Bharat Hotels by a consortium of the three institutions.\n\n\nOf this, the share of IDBI is Rs. 4  crore  , ICPI Rs.\n2  crore  , and ICICI Rs. 2  crore  .\n\n\nSimultaneously, the agreement provides for a Euro-Dollar loan of\nUS\n\n$7,630,742 ( Rs. 11.93  crores  as per the balance sheet)\nadvanced by four banks: Bank of Baroda, Syndicate Bank, Central Bank of\nIndia, and Indian Overseas Bank.\n\n\nThe sums advanced are: Bank of Baroda US\n\n$3,582,215.22, Syndicate US\n\n$2,352,805.04, Central US\n\n$847,859.37, Indian Overseas, US\n\n$847,859.37. \n\n \n\nThe mortgage is, in this instance, in respect of all movable\nimmovable properties.\n\n\nThis is the only time that immovable property has been charged.\n\n\nWhy this was not included in subsequent mortgages is explained later.\n\n\n \n\nThe latest balance sheet shows only Bank of Baroda's\noutstandings.\n\n\nObviously, the bank has transferred the amounts advanced by the\nconsortium to itself. \n\n \n\n- - On May 15, 1986, within six months of Rs. 21  crore\n being handed over, IFCI sanctioned a term loan of Rs. 3.5 \ncrore  .\n\n\nThis is under the Project Finance Participation Scheme ( PFPS).\n\n\nThe mortgage is now only on movable property and the short\nparticulars of this head are repeated verbatim in all subsequent agreements.\n\n\n \n\n- - On March 3, 1987, IFCI and IDBI provide for another Rs. one\n crore  in equal proportions.\n\n\nThe mortgage comprises only movable property. \n\n \n\n- - On June 8, 1988, the three financial institutions again\nseek to bail out Suri.\n\n\nThis time they rush with Rs. 10.38  crore  approx. as\nterm loans.\n\n\nThe break-up this time is, IDBI Rs. 5,28,35,000, ICICI Rs.\n2,44,00,000 and IFCI Rs. 2,65,06,000.\n\n\nThe mortgage, needless to add, is pots and pans, cots and carpets.\n\n\n \n\n- - On March 3, 1989, responding to a further SOS from Suri, as\nin their own words the borrower is in need of further funds: the trio of\nfinancial institutions provide succour to the tune of another Rs. 4 \ncrore  .\n\n\nThe lenders themselves have divided this in the ratio of IDBI Rs. 2\n crores  and the other two Rs. one  crore \neach.\n\n\nThe mortgaged items are the same. \n\n \n\nIn addition to these amounts, the balance sheet of the company\nshows a Rs. one  crore  rupee term loan extended by Bank of\nBaroda and a cash credit facility of Rs. 1.15  crore  with\nCanara Bank    against   hypothecation of\nstocks, stores, supplies and book debts. \n\n \n\nThe items offered as security, reproduced with almost\ncyclostyled monotony in all the agreements, read thus:- \n\n \n\n  \" The whole of the movable properties of the\nBorrower, ( Bharat Hotels) including its movable plant and machinery,\nmachinery spares, tools and accessories, fixtures and fittings, electrical\ninstallations, furnitures, cutleries, crockeries, utensils, vessels,\nmattresses, carpets, cots, tables, cars, trucks, jeeps, buses, vehicles,\ntrollies, calculating machines, refrigerators, air-conditioners, coolers,\nmodern electrical/ electronic and other appliances, computers, etc. and other\nmovables, both present and future ( save and except book debts) whether\ninstalled or not and whether now lying loose or in cases or which are now\nlying or stores in or about or shall hereafter from time to time during the\ncontinuance of the security of these presents be brought into or upon or\nbe stored or be in or about all the Borrower's hotel, premises and godowns\nwherever the same may be or be held by any part to the order or disposition\nof the borrower, or in the course of transit or on high seas or on order, or\ndelivery howsoever and wheresoever in the possession of the borrower and\neither by way of addition or substitution.\"   \n\n\n Continued on page 7 \n\n\n Need to review bonanza for Lalit Suri \n\n\n Continued from page 1 \n\n \n\nThis outflow of public finance into the apparently bottomless pit\nof Bharat Hotels would never have been sanctioned on an independent appraisal\nof merit for the following reasons. \n\n \n\nThe hotel itself was conceived of an illegality.\n\n\nThe land on which the Holiday Inn was built was leased by the Finance\nMinistry to the New Delhi    Municipal  \nCorporation ( NDMC) with the specific condition that no sub-lease be created\nor the land handed over to any private party for development.\n\n\nThis was, of course, abrogated. \n\n \n\nThe agreement with NDMC, however, stipulated that the land and\nany structure on it could not be sold, disposed of or even mortgaged.\n\n\nAs Suri could not pledge immovable property, the NDMC agreement was\nsupplemented with two memoranda which allowed the hotel to mortgage\nstructures on it but not the land.\n\n\nThis was all unearthed by the outgoing PAC chaired by Amal Datta.\n\n\n \n\nHowever, it is a clear legal postulate that no structure can\nbe mortgaged in isolation of the land it is situated on.\n\n\nThe PAC's draft report is extremely illuminating on this score: \n \" The Committee has asked for the papers relating to the\ntransactions so as to enable it to obtain the opinion of the\nAttorney-General as to whether it is legally permissible to create a mortgage\nin such a fashion <*> dotted-line</*> we are practically convinced that it is\nnot permissible.\n\n\nHowever, the financial institutions required repeated prodding to\nbring before the Committee the very scanty information and ultimately did\nto make sure it was too late to be able to take a legal opinion of the\nAttorney-General.\n\n\nThey gave the impression that they were reluctant to have the\nmatter probed or the legality scrutinised.\"   \n\n \n\nThis was possibly the reason why after the initial sanction of\nRs. 8  crores  by the three FIs for both movable and immovable\nproperty, the rest of the term loans were all secured by only movable\nproperty. \n\n \n\nThe Company has been unable to honour its commitments on its\nrepayment schedule and the payments on some of its loans had to be\nrescheduled.\n\n\nThe 1988-89 balance sheet of Bharat Hotels shows only the interest\naccrued and due on term loans as Rs. 5.03  crores  .\n\n\nIt must also be born in mind that the company enjoyed a substantial\nholiday before the instalments on its loans became due.\n\n\nFor example, the first instalment on a term loan sanctioned by\nIFCI of Rs. 3.5  crore  , with the charge created on May\n15,1986, was due only on May 15,1988, to be paid in six monthly instalments\nright    up to   May 15, 1995. \n\n \n\nIn the instance of the Bank of Baroda's euro-dollar loans\nprovided by BOB's London branch, the situation is so piquant, it is almost\na double blow.\n\n\nAccording to the stringent requirements of the Bank of England,\nthe monitoring body in the UK, any loan on which there is a default of two\nconsecutive payments is classified as non-performing.\n\n\nThis is immediately reported by vigilant auditors and the bank has to\nmake a provision out of profits for the entire amount of the loan. \n\n \n\nToday, the bank has not recovered even the interest on its loans.\n\n\nIt has had to take special permission of the Reserve Bank under\nSection 16 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act ( FERA) and is remitting\nthe interest component from its own funds to its branch in London.\n\n\nIf the bank wants to avoid any adverse reaction from Bank of England,\nit will have to remit US\n\n$ 1.977 million ( Rs. 3.3  crore  ) to date.\n\n\nA large amount has already been remitted on this account. \n\n \n\nIn fact, an internal note of BOB states that the party has failed\nto remit interest on the euro-dollar loan deposit despite several reminders.\n\n\nThe documents are not executed properly and guarantee fees have not\nbeen paid for the past two years.\n\n\nIt is also learnt that    in spite   of\nthe account classified as sick, a sum of Rs. 2  crore  has\nbeen advanced against the shopping complex.\n\n\nLegal action is now being contemplated to recover the outstanding.\n\n\n \n\nThe tangible security offered against these loans is extremely\ninadequate to cover the Rs. 45  crore  plus dues of the\ncompany. \n\n \n\nOn January 1, 1988, when the banks and FIs has already advanced\nRs. 25.5  crore  to the company, the balance sheet showed the\nwritten down value of the plant and machinery, furniture and fixtures and\nvehicles at Rs. 16.58  crore  .\n\n\nAt the end of March 1989, the written down value had doubled to Rs.\n43.5  crore  .\n\n\nHowever, considering the nature of plant and machinery, comprising\nmainly airconditioning plants and lifts which have no manufacturing output,\nthe maximum that can be advanced by banks is about 60-65 per cent.\n\n\nThus, the FIs and banks, had they followed norms, could not have\nadvanced more than around Rs. 30  crore  towards the project.\n\n\n \n\nFurther, the company exhibits an extremely poor    debt-equity   ratio of 25:1.\n\n\nThis is against 2:1 for a healthy company.\n\n\nWhile the debt of Bharat Hotels amounts to Rs. 79.54  crore\n ( loan funds of Rs. 47.60  crore  plus deposits for\nsub-licence fee on the shopping centre of Rs. 31.94  crore  )\nthe equity amounts to only Rs. 3.23  crore  ( shareholder's\nfunds and reserves totalling Rs. 14.33  crores  minus\ncarried forward losses of Rs. 11.09  crore  ) . \n\n \n\nIn the present circumstances of increasing debts, rising losses\nand uncertainty over the title of land, the company presents a very poor\ninvestment for FIs. \n\n \n\nWhile the motivation for the financial \ninfusion of funds needs to be probed, in order to protect their investment\nthey would be left with little recourse but to exercise their option to\nconvert, as stipulated in their agreements, 20 per cent of the loan amounts\naggregating Rs. 26.87  crore  into fully paid equity shares\nand assume control of the company. \n\n \n\nThe financial affairs of Bharat Hotels is symptomatic foremost of\nthe arbitrary functioning of financial institutions.\n\n\nThe government needs to send clear signals that the heads of FIs are\nto strictly function within parameters and not seek to appease political\nbosses to nurture prospects of personal advancement.", "subdomain":

Sastry \n\n\n Andhra University, Swami Jnanananda Laboratories for Nuclear\nResearch, Visakhapatnam  - 530 003\n\n \n\n Trace element analysis in about 200 air samples collected\nover a period of 2 year and belonging to the industrial and control zones of\nthe city of Visakhapatnam was performed using an Energy Dispersive X-Ray\nFluorescence ( EDXRF ) system.\n\n\nSimilarly water and hair samples was studied.\n\n\nThe results of these investigations are reported and discussed in this\npaper.    \n\n\n  INTRODUCTION  \n\n \n\nOur earlier studies ( Sankara Rao  et al.,  1985 a and b;\nSree Krishna Murty  et al.,  1987 ) on trace element analysis in\naerosol samples of the industrial region of Visakhapatnam using a high\nresolution EDXRF spectrometer have shown high levels of Pb and Zn which are\nof toxic nature.\n\n\nIn these studies aerosol samples were collected during particular\nhours of the day and a continuous sampling was not made to look for diurnal\nand seasonal variations.\n\n\nIn the present an attempt was made to look for diurnal and seasonal\nvariations in the trace element distribution in air particulate matter for\nthe years 1987 and 1988 by collecting aerosols continuously over a period of\n20 hr in a day at different sites.\n\n\nThe preliminary results were reported in Sree Krishna Murty \net al.  ( 1987 ) .\n\n\nWe have also analysed trace elements in open well water samples\nlocated in the industrial and non-industrial zones using energy\ndispersive X-ray fluorescenee ( EDXRF ) method.\n\n\nThe results of this study were reported in Sree Krishna Murty  et\nal.  ( 1988 ) .\n\n\nThe human head hair samples collected from polluted and non pollured\nareas were qualitatively analysed using the present technique.\n\n\nThe results of the analysis of different types of environmental\nsamples concerning the city of Visakhapatnam are correlated and discussed\nin this paper. \n\n\n  ANALYSIS OF AEROSOL SAMPLES  \n\n\n  Sampling  \n\n \n\nThe aerosol samples were collected on TFA 41 and Whatman 541\nglass fibre filter papers using a high volume air sampler at a height of 5 -\n10 m from the ground level.\n\n\nThe sites where the air sampling was conducted are shown in the map\nof city of Visakhapatnam ( Figure 1 ) .\n\n\nTo study the diurnal variations in the aerosol composition, the\nsamples were collected continuously at time intervals of 4 hr and the same\nwas done in different seasons to look for seasonal variations.\n\n\nThe volume of air collected at each place was of the order of 120\nm3. \n\n\n  EXPERIMENTATION  \n\n \n\nThe EDXRF system used for the trace element analysis of\nenvironmental samples was described in Sastry  et al.  ( 1984 ) and\nSankara Rao  et al.  ( 1985 a and b ) .\n\n\nIt is an integrated system comprising of a low power X-ray generator\n( 25 W ) to excite the samples and a high resolution ( 160 eV at 5.9 keV )\ndetector system coupled to a microprocessor controlled multichannel\nanalyser.\n\n\nThe system was operated at a tube voltage of 25 KV and a tube\ncurrent of 100 <*> mu<*/>A.\n\n\nThe procedure followed for data collection, determination of net\ncharacteristic X-ray intensities emitted by different trace elements in a\nsample and the quantification of the characteristic X-ray intensities were\ndescribed in Sastry  et al.  ( 1984 ) and Sankara Rao  et al.\n ( 1985 a and b ) .\n\n\nTypical characteristic X-ray spectra at a place called Mindi\nVillage surrounded by the industrial belt corresponding to winter and\nsummer months are shown in figures 2 and 3 respectively.\n\n\nThese spectra are also due to a particular time interval in a day.\n\n\nThe same for the Andhra University region which was taken as control\nare given in figures 4 and 5 respectively. \n\n\n  RESULT AND DISCUSSION  \n\n \n\nTen aerosol samples were standardised at Air Monitoring\nSection, BARC, Bombay using a  55Fe source which emits 5.9 keV K -\nX-rays and X-ray tube fitted with a secondary target ( Mo ) which emits 17.44\nkeV X-rays as primary source of excitation for low Z and high Z elements,\nrespectively ( Sadasivan  \n    et al.,  1982 ) .\n\n\nThin film standards namely, Ca, Fe and Pb were used as targets to\ndetermine the product \" I0G \" , where \"\nI0 \" is the primary flux and \" G \" is the\ngeometrical factor in different regions of Z.\n\n\nNecessary corrections for absorption in the sample and in the\nfilter paper were applied to get the net final intensities.\n\n\nThen, the elemental concentrations in different aerosol samples were\ndetermined using the net characteristic X-ray intensities.\n\n\nThey are summarized in tables 1 and 2 for the Mindi village and 3\nand 4 for Andhra University.\n\n\nThese tables also include the meteorological parameters recorded\nwhile sampling.\n\n\nThe uncertainity in the elemental concentrations      is of the order of 15 % which arrises out of counting\nstatistics, background subtraction, instrumental instability, absorption\ncorrection and errors in the values of standards.  \n   \n\n \n\nThe presence of high levels of Zn and Pb in aerosol samples is\nattributed to the surrounding industries which are close to the site of\nsampling.\n\n\nThe diurnal variations in the present case are due to the\natmospheric conditions like wind velocity and favourable wind directions.\n\n\nThus, Zn and Pb may be regarded as of an anthropogenic origin.\n\n\nThe variations in the levels of Ca and Fe at different timings of the\nday are mainly due to earth crustal dust raised into the atmosphere by the\nvehicular traffic and winds.\n\n\nIt is also to be noted that the levels of Zn and Pb are high during\nwinter months when compared with those of summer.\n\n\nIt is ascribed to increased fuel burning and local inversions which\nlead to poorer dispersion of pollutants during the winter season ( Padmanabha\nMurty  et al.,  1984; McDonald  et al.,  1979 ) .\n\n\nFrom tables 1 - 4 the high levels of Ca and Fe found in the aerosol\nsamples collected during summer months which are of earth crustal origin are\nunderstood as due to heavy winds and vehicular traffic.\n\n\nFrom the tables 3 and 4 representing the control area it can be\nseen that the concentrations of different trace elements are less than\nthose of industrial area.\n\n\nHowever, the trends in seasonal variations in the levels of Zn and\nPb are the same as those for the Industrial area.\n\n\nThe diurnal variations in control area are found to be not\nsignificant. \n\n \n\nFrom the present studies extending over a period of 3 year it is\nfound that the average of total suspended particulate matter of different\nsites in Visakhapatnam is 160 <*> mu<*/>g / m3 while the same ranges\nfrom 140 to 540 <*> mu<*/>g / m3 in India.\n\n\nIt is fonnd that 35 % of the air particulate matter during the winter\nseason accounts for the trace elemental composition.\n\n\nThus, the unaccounted mass would consist of other major crustal\nelements Na, Mg, Si, Al, O2, N2 and in particular C.\n\n\n\n  WATER SAMPLES  \n\n \n\nThe results on the trace element analysis of different ground\nwater samples collected from open wells  belonging\nto the city of Visakhapatnam were reported in Sree Krishna Murty  et al.\n ( 1988 ) .\n\n\nThey show that the Pb levels are not only high in the samples of the\nindustrial zone but also in those at two remote sites free from\nindustries.\n\n\nThe high levels of Pb in the water samples belonging to the\nindustrial region could be attributed to the Pb pollution in the aerosol\nsamples of this region.\n\n\nThe same at sites free from industries may be due to gasoline burning\nbecause of heavy vehicular traffic and also may be in the well site itself.\n\n\n\n  ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS OF HAIR SAMPLES  \n\n \n\n16 head hair sarnples belong to the people of Mulagado village\nclose to the city of Visakhapatnam and exposed to several industries were\ncollected and 17 of normals were also collected for the purpose of trace\nelement analysis using the present EDXRF technique.\n\n\nThe hair was thoroughly washed with mixture of acetone and de-ionised\nwater in the ratio of 3 : 1 and then dried.\n\n\nThe same was ashed and a few mg of each sample was uniformly spread\non a cello tape.\n\n\nThe samples were exposed to the primary source of exciting radiation\n( X-ray generator ) and the data were collected as in the case of air and\nwater samples.\n\n\nTwo typical XRF spectra are shown in figures 6 and 7 belonging to the\nnormal and the Mulagada village respectively.\n\n\nNo quantification of the characteristic X-ray intensities emitted\nby each element in a hair sample could be done because of the\nnon-availability of a suitable hair standard.\n\n\nHowever, the characteristic X-ray intensities were computed in the\nusual manner.\n\n\nFrom figures 6 and 7 it can be seen that the characteristic X-ray\nintensities of Pb from the industrial sample is higher than that from the\nnormal.\n\n\nThe average characteristic X-ray intensities for the hair samples\nfrom the polluted and non-polluted regions are given below :\n\n\nAverage Pb X - ray intensity of belongs to normals people = 151 <*>\nplus or minus</*> 31\n\n\nAverage Pb X-ray intensity of belongs to inhabitants exposed to\npollution = 4565 <*> plus or minus</*> 97 \n\n\n  CONCLUSION  \n\n \n\nThe present trace element analysis of environmental samples shows\nthat the lead levels in general are high in the industrial region of the city\nof Visakhapatnam.\n\n\nOur earlier analysis ( Sankara Roo  et al.,  1986 ) of 200\nblood samples of the inhabitants   of Mindi village have shown low Fe levels in 164 samples\nindicating anaemic condition.\n\n\nPb pollution is likely to interfere with haemglobin synthesis\nprocess.\n\n\nHowever, malnutrition could also be one of the reasons.\n\n\nA social survey of this region will give an idea about the real\nsituation. \n\n\n  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  \n\n \n\nThe authors acknowledge the \" Defence Research and\nDevelopment Organisation, Ministry of Defence, Govt of India \" for\nfunding the research project entitled  \" ` Pollution\nstudies in and around Visakhapatnam' \"  to under take the\npresent studies.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ad576579-08cd-489c-868a-813378ce3dc1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.203655+00:00"}

M. smelter \" , ( c) \"\nAdministrative building \" , ( d) \" Silos \" , ( e)\n\" Coal handling area \" , ( f) \" Lime storage and\nhandling area \" , ( g) \" Caustic storage and handling area\n\" , ( h) \" Ball mill \" , ( i) \" Bauxite\nyard \" , ( j) \" Tippler site \" , and ( k) \"\nEngineering building \" . \n\n \n\nThe objective of air quality monitoring was multifold, and,\ntherefore, number and height of monitoring stations at aforereferred sites\nwere varied.\n\n\nIn cell hours 8 parallel rows of cells are present.\n\n\nFluoride is the major pollutant generated during cell house\noperations.\n\n\nAir quality monitoring in cell house was carried out to determine\nfugitive emission rates of SO2, NO2, SPM in general and\nfluoride in particular.\n\n\nAir quality moniotring was carried out on either side of smelters at\n1.2 m height and 6 m away from smelters,    and some sampling stations were kept\nat 6 m, height near roof level.\n\n\nThe detaile of air quality monitoring stations are depicted in\nfigure 1. \" SPM \" was observed to be the major pollutant\nat \" silos \" , \" coal handling area \" ,\n\" lime storage and handling area \" , \" caustic\nstorage and handling area \" , \" ball mill \" ,\n\" bauxite yard \" and \" tippler site \" and\n\" air monitoring at G.M. smelter building \" , \"\nadministrative building \" and \" engineering building\n\" was carried out to determine air quality inside the plant\npremises. \n\n\n  MATERIAL AND METHOD  \n\n \n\nSamples were analysed for total suspended matter, SO2,\nNOx and fluorides, Sampling was carried out at intervals of 4 hr for\na period of 24 hr at each site and the samples were analysed immediately.\n\n\nThe suspended particulata matter ( \" SPM \" ) was\ncollected on preweighed Whatman glass fibre filter paper of        20.3 cm x 25.4\ncm size using high-volume air sampler.\n\n\nThe flow rate was maintained between 1-1. 2 m2/min.\n\n\nGravimetric method was used for estimation of \" SPM\n\" .\n\n\nThe gases were collected by wet impingement method using midget\nimpingers.\n\n\n\" West and Gaeke \" method was used for the analysis\nof sulphur dioxide, 0.1 M sodium tetrachloromercurate was kept in the\nimpinger as the absorbing reagent and the gas was sucked into it at the rate\nof 1 lpm.\n\n\nThe red-purple coloured para-rosaniline methyl sulphonic acid was\nmeasured at 560 nm.  \n\n \n\nNitrogn oxides were measured using the method suggested by\nJacobs and Hochheiser.\n\n\n0.1 M sodium hydroxide was used as the absorbing medium.\n\n\nThe coloured complex formed was measured at 540 nm.\n\n\nTotal fluoride was analysed by adsorbing the air in 0.1 M sodium\nhydroxide solution at a flow rate of 0.8 lpm.\n\n\nThe pore diameter of the impinger was 1 mm.\n\n\nFluoride and hydrogen fluoride were measured in the alkaline solution\nusing Orion model 407 A pH / mv meter with fluoride selective electrode (\nOrion 94. 09 ) and single junction reference electrode ( Orion 90-91 ) .\n\n\n\" TISAB  3  \" was used as the buffer\nand the complexing reagent to remove any interfering ions present.\n\n\nAnalysis of particulate fluorides was carried out by extracting\nwater soluble particulate matter collected on filter paper after weighing\nthe \" SPM \" .\n\n\nFurther analysis was similar to that of total fluoride.\n\n\nDetermination was carried out in the blank simultanously to assess\nthe possible presence of any fluoride in GF/ A paper. \n\n\n  RESULT AND DISCUSSION  \n\n \n\nThe sampling sites were selected to study the air quality in the\nwork environment of an aluminium plant, the various pollutants present and\nthe sources.\n\n\nTaking into account the production activities of the complex,\n\" SPM \" , NOx, SO2 and fluorides were\nidentified as significant pollutants.\n\n\nSmelter is the main source of pollution in the aluminium plant.\n\n\nCryolite, which is used in the cell at a temperatures of 900 <*>\ndegrees</*>C and above is the primary source of fluoride in the workzone\natmosphere.\n\n\nRuptures in the electrolytic cell may lead to the escape of HF and\nparticulate fluorides.\n\n\nCoke is used in the anode which might be a source of SO2 and\nNOx.\n\n\nDust is another pollutant in the cell house.\n\n\n\" Alumina powder \" , \" cryolite \" ,\nand \" CaF2 \" are fed to the cells.\n\n\nThese may escape into the air due to wind action and vehicular\nmovement, etc.\n\n\nSteam plant provided with 3 high pressure boilers and one low\npressure is the major source of SO2 and dust emissions.\n\n\nThe observed concentrations of various pollutants at the cell house\nand work zone are reported in tables 1 and 2, respectively. \n\n \n\nMaximum average \" SPM \" concentration was\nobserved near the tippler because of the unloading operations of\nbauxite ore from the railway wagons and transportation through conveyer belt.\n\n\nThe Ball Mill area also recorded high concentration of \" SPM\n\" because of ore crushing and grinding operations.\n\n\nHigh dust concentration in the cell house is due to the use of\nalumina and cryolite powder in the process.\n\n\nA higher concentration has been observed at roof level than at ground\nlevel of cell house.\n\n\nA minimum \" SPM \" concentration of 173 <*>\nmu</*>g / m3 ( average ) was observed in the G.M. smelter.\n\n\nThe \" SPM \" concentration was found to vary at\ndifferent parts of the day.\n\n\nThe concentration of \" SPM \" at the cell house was\nfound to vary at different locations and with time ( Figure 2 ) .\n\n\nThe concentration of sulphur dioxide was observed to be higher in\nthe cell house area as compared to other locations.\n\n\nA maximum concentration of 457 <*> mu</*>g / m2 was measured\nnear one of the cells.\n\n\nSO2 is produced due to the oxidation of sulphur in coke and\nother fuels.\n\n\nA minimum concentration of 6 <*> mu</*>g / m3 was\nrecorded in the Ball mill area.\n\n\nThis sampling point was the farthest point from the smelter and,\ntherefore, recorded a very low SO2 concentration.\n\n\nIn the cell house, higher concentration was observed at roof\nheight than at ground level ( Figure 3 ) .\n\n\nThe concentration showed considerable temporal and spatial\ndistribution and different concentration were recorded on either side of the\ncell ( Figure 4 ) . \n\n \n\nDxides of nitrogen, mainly nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide are\nthe other pollutants also monitored within the plant premises.\n\n\nHigher concentration of NO4 was observed in the cell house,\nas also in the coal handling area.\n\n\nCell house is the primary source of fluoride in the workzone\natmosphere.\n\n\nIt can be observed from table 1 and figure 5 that higher\nconcentrations of total and particulate fluorides are recorded in the cell\nhouse.\n\n\nThe concentration showed decreasing trend as the distance from\nsmelter increased.\n\n\nThe gaseous fluoride concentration in cell house varied in the\nrange of 43-1983 <*> mu</*>g / m3.\n\n\nFluoride concentrations were observed to be more in inner / rows\nin comparison to those recorded near outer rows.\n\n\nHigher concentrations wre observed at roof level air monitoring\nstations.\n\n\nFluoride concentration in suspended particulate matter extracted\nfrom filter paper varied in the range of 42-820 <*> mu</*>g / m3.\n\n\nAt some of the monitoring stations, particulate fluoride\nconcentrations were observed to be higher than the gaseous fluoride\nconcentrations.\n\n\nThe higher concentration of fluoride may be due to rupture in\nelectrolytic cells. \n\n\n  CONCLUSION  \n\n \n\nIt was observed during the study that gaseous pollutants\nescape into the atmosphere due to rupture in \nelectrolytic cells resdulting in very high concentration of gaseous and\nparticulate fluorides.\n\n\nIn addition other pollutants were also observed to be emitted\nfrom cell house.\n\n\nAverage fluoride concentrations at other monitoring stations were\nfound to be comparatively less.\n\n\nInterestingly, particulate fluoride concentrations were observed\nto be comparatively less at monitoring stations other than the cell house.\n\n\nSPM concentrations recorded as high as 7771 <*> mu</*>g /\nm3 in lime area indicate higher source strength.\n\n\nIt was observed that the pollutant concentrations are very much less\nat administration building, G.M. Smelter building and engineering building\nas these monitoring stations were located far from air pollution sources\nand the observations were taken on building roof tops.\n\n\nThese observations indicate need for efficient collection of gaseous\npollutants in fume hoods, use of precipiators and scrubing before\ndischarging into the atmosphere through stacks.\n\n\nBoth wet and dry scrubbing help in efficient fume control.\n\n\nEffective house keeping is essential to reduce the pollutant\nconcentration in the work area and above all it demands proper operation and\nmaintenance.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6d30915f-b5c8-469e-8ac0-8cc324a51c42", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.204440+00:00"}
{"text": "<*> line from left to right <*>\n\n\n  REVIVING SALT CROSSED SOILS   <*> double line\nfrom left to right <*> <*> right justification </*> \n\n \n\nNEARLY seven million hectares of land is salt-affected and lying\nuncultivated, although the soils are potentially productive.\n\n\nThe saline soils are found mainly in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,\nMaharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat.\n\n\nThe alkali soils are predominent in the Indo-Gangetic plains,\nencompassing the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, parts of Bihar and\nRajasthan.\n\n\nIsolated patches of alkali soils also occur in some parts.\n\n\nWith the advent of canal irrigation, salinity and alkalinity are\nextending to large areas of fertile cultivable lands. \n\n\n  HOW SALT-AFFECTED SOILS ARE FORMED?  \n\n \n\nSalt-affected soils are formed whenever soil and hydrological\nconditions favour the accumulation of soluble salts in the root zone of\nsoils, even though temporarily.\n\n\nSalt-affected soils generally do not occur extensively in the humid\nareas.\n\n\nThis is because the salts get continuously leached out of the soil\nroot zone by the leaching action of rain water.\n\n\nLeached salts are transported to other areas through surface and\nsubsurface flows, the areas of discharge depending on the geohydrological,\nsoil and climatic features.\n\n\nSalt-affected soils are of common occurence in the semi-arid and arid\nregions which receive an inadequate rainfall to accomplish leaching of salts\noriginally present in the soil profile. \n\n \n\nThe saline / alkaline soils are developed by any one or more of\nseveral means, as follows:  <*> small circle to left </*>\n\n \n\nIn arid regions, where there is low rainfall and high\ntemperature, there is always a tendency for the accumulation of soluble salts\nnear the surface due to intense evaporation and less percolation.  <*>\nsmall circle to left </*>\n\n \n\nThe ground water of arid regions usually contains considerable\nquantities of soluble salts.\n\n\nIf it is used for irrigaiton it spoils the good soils.\n\n\nThe extent of damage depends not only upon the salt content of\nirrigation water but also on the nature of salts and type of soils on which\nthe water is to be used.\n\n\nThe sodium salts are more harmful than Ca and Mg and amongst them,\nNaCl is the worst culprit.  <*> small circle to left </*>\n\n \n\nSometimes the salts may have originated directly from chemical\nweathering of rocks and deposited on good soils.  <*> small circle to\nleft </*>\n\n \n\nWhen excessive applications of irrigation water have raised the\nground water level sufficiently to permit concentration of salts from saline\nground water at the surface by capillary action through intense evaporation,\nit leaves ever-increasing salts at the surface.  <*> small circle to left\n</*>\n\n \n\nWhen seepage from leaky canals and lateral channels, which run at\na higher level, has resulted in a high water table, formation of\nsaline/alkali soils takes places.  <*> small circle to left </*>\n\n \n\nPoor drainage keeps the salts in the surface soil and prevents\nthe leaching of salts down below the root zone.  <*> small circle to left\n</*>\n\n \n\nWhen the use of irrigation water is erratic, that is flooding at\none time followed by intense drying and long breaks.\n\n\nWhen the total supply of water is limited and irregular this would\nalso leave the salts in the root zone. \n\n \n\nSalt-affected soils occur in all continents, but they are very\nunevenly distributed.\n\n\nThey occur most extensively in the arid and semi-arid, and in\nsubhumid regions.\n\n\nThey may also occur in the humid regions.\n\n\nAccording to FAO study, salt-affected soils occupy nearly seven\nper cent of the  land area. \n\n \n\nThe latest survey indicates that salt affected area has increased\nto about 10 million ha.\n\n\nIt is also feared that several  million ha.\nof productive land in the newly irrigated areas will soon deteriorate if\npreventive steps are not taken. \n\n\n  CHARACTERISTICS OF SALT-AFFECTED SOILS  \n\n \n\n  Saline soils:  \n\n\nThe saline soils have excessive concentration of natural soluble\nsalts mainly of chlorides, sulphates and carbonates of calcium, magnesium and\nsodium.\n\n\nThe electric conductivity of saturated soil extract at 25oC\nis more than 4 mm hos/cm, exchangeable sodium percentage less than 15 per\ncent and pH less than 8.5.\n\n\nSaline soils are in flocculated condition and consequently have\nsatisfactory physical characterists.\n\n\nThey are also called  \" white alkali\"  or  \"\nsolonchak\"  soils. \n\n \n\nThe best way of diagnosis is to collect ( 0.15 cm) composite soil\nsample and get it analysed in the soil testing    \n  \nlaboratory.\n\n\nHowever, some of the visual characteristics, by which one can\ndiagnose the affected soils in the field itself, are given below:  <*>\nsmall circle to left </*>\n\n \n\nProminently white fluffy salt encrustation on the surface during\ndry period, when the net movement of soil moisture is upward.\n\n\nThe salts dissolved in the soil water move to the surface, where they\nare left as a crust when the water evaporates.  <*> small circle to left\n</*>\n\n \n\nThe rate of water permeability is relatively high.  <*> small\ncircle to left </*>\n\n \n\nIn severely affected areas complete failure of crop, while\nstunted and patchy poor growth in less severely affected areas is observed.\n <*> small circle to left </*>\n\n \n\nIn areas having relatively more moist conditions the prominent\ngrowth of plants like Sueda species is observed. \n\n \n\n  Alkali soils:  \n\n\nIn these soils the percentage of exchangeable sodium content is\ngreater than 15 per cent as a result the pH is between 8.5 and 10.0.\n\n\nThe electric conductivity is below 4 mm hos/cm at 25oC.\n\n\nBecause of the high sodium content, both the clay and organic matter\nare dispersed, and the result is close packing of the soil particles and\nreduced pore space and aeration.\n\n\nThe poor aeration and high sodium content, which is often toxic, make\nalkali soils difficult and expensive to reclaim.\n\n\nUnder field conditions the following symptoms will be seen:   <*> small circle to left </*>\n\n \n\nWhite salt encrustation on the surface during summer, which often\nshows dark black colour on wetting.\n\n\nDue to this special character they are usually called  \" black\nalkali soils\"  .  <*> small circle to left </*>\n\n \n\nWhen the soil is ploughed slightly wet, it turns over in slick\nand gives out rubbery furrow slices.  <*> small circle to left </*>\n\n \n\nOn drying shallow cracks are developed at the surface and soil\nbecomes very hard and compact.  <*> small circle to left </*>\n\n \n\nDue to low hydraulic conductivity the water does not move down\nquickly and remains standing on the surface in a muddy condition for a long\nperiod.  <*> small circle to left </*>\n\n \n\nThe grasses mainly of Sporobolous species thrive, but they also\ndie subsequently during summer.  <*> small circle to left </*>\n\n \n\nPractically no crops can stand satisfactorily and land gives a\ndesolate barren look. \n\n \n\n  Saline alkali soil:  \n\n\nThese are both saline and alkali in various stages of transition\nhaving electrical conductivity of saturated soil extract more than 5 mmhos/cm\nat 25oC, exchangeable sodium in excess of 15 per cent and pH above\n8.5 depending upon the relative amounts of exchangeable sodium and soluble\nsalts.\n\n\nWhen soluble salts are leached downward, the pH will rise above 8.5,\nbut when the soluble salts again accumulate the pH may again fall to 8.5.\n\n\nThere may not be salt deposits on the surface.\n\n\nHowever, the hard clay pan in the lower layer obstructs the drainage.\n\n\nThere may be a lime pan at lower depths.\n\n\nThey usually suffer from water-logging. \n\n\n  HARMFUL EFFECTS ON GROWING PLANTS  \n\n \n\nThe saline soils do not support plant growth primarily because of\nexcessive salts in the soil solution which, due to high osmotic pressure,\nprevents absorption of moisture and nutrients in adequate amounts.\n\n\nThus, in saline soils the wilting co-efficient is high and the amount\nof available moisture is low.\n\n\nAn excess of sodium ions also exert antagonistic effect on the\nabsorption of calcium and magnesium.\n\n\nUnder alkali soil conditions, the damage is not due to salt\nconcentration, since the conductivity of the soil solution is low.\n\n\nThe sodium absorbed by soil clay and organic colloids causes\ndispersion of clay which results in a loss of desirable structure and the\ndevelopment of puddied effect.\n\n\nSuch effect on physical properties reduce drainage, aeration and\nmicrobial activity.\n\n\nUnder saline-alkali conditions, the crop may suffer due to high\nsalinity as well as due to unfavourable effects of alkalinity on the nutrient\navailability \n\n\n  RECLAMATION OF SALT-AFFECTED SOILS  \n\n \n\n  Alkali soils  : \n\n\nBasically reclamation or improvement of alkali soils requires the\nremoval of a part or most of the exchangeable sodium and its replacement by\nthe more favourable calcium ions in the root zone.\n\n\nThis can be accomplished in many ways, the best dictated by local\nconditions available, rotation of the crops to be grown and reclamation of\nthe soil.\n\n\nLevelling and bunding of salt-affected fields are major components of\ntheir reclamation. \n\n \n\n  Amendments  : \n\n\nThe alkali soils in the Indo-Gangetic plains are mostly calcarious.\n\n\nTherefore, there is a wider choice of amendments like calcium sources\nor acid.\n\n\nCalcium carrying amendments include gypsum and phosphogypsum which\nare very commonly used as direct source of calcium to replace exchangeable\nsodium. \n\n \n\nIn India, as in many countries, gypsum/pyrite is the most widely\nused amendment for alkali soil reclamation. \n\n\nSoil Na+ + CaSo4 - Soil Ca++ + Na2 So4 Na+ ( Leached)\n\n \n\nMany other amendments, e.g., sulphuric acid, calcium chloride can\nalso be used and are as much or even slightly more effective than gypsum, but\nthese materials are generally expensive. \n\n \n\nQuantity of an amendment needed for alkali soil reclamation\ndepends upon the amount of exchangeable sodium that has to  be replaced.\n\n\nThese depends both on the amount of sodium absorbed into the soil and\nthe alkali tolerants, including the rooting depth of the crops to be grown.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHOW THE AMENDMENTS REACT AND BRING THE SOIL TO NORMAL CONDITIONS?\n \n\n \n\n  Gypsum  : \n\n\nThe gypsum converts sodium soil into calcium soil by cationic\nexchange, with a desirable lowering of pH and an improvement in soil physical\nconditions.\n\n\nThe gypsum powder to be applied should be of 30 mesh fineness and be\nmixed in top 10 cm soil with the help of a disc or M.B. plough.\n\n\nThe reactions involved in the soil are: 2Na - clay+CaSo4 = Ca - clay\n+ Na2 So4 ( Leached out) \n\n \n\n  Sulphur  : \n\n\nIn extreme cases of high alkalinity, the reduction in pH can be\nbrought about by the use of sulphuric acid.\n\n\nHowever, it requires expert handling and is quite expensive.\n\n\nThe sulphur added to the soil is oxidized to sulphuric acid with the\nhelp of microbiological oxidation which converts calcium carbonate to calcium\nsulphate and Ca++ replaces Na+ in the clay complex.  2S\n+ 302 = 2 So3 So3 + H2o = H2So4 H2So4 + Caco3 = CaSo4 + Co2 + H2O 2\nNa - clay + CaSo4 + Ca - clay + Na2So4 ( Leached out)\n\n  Organic matter  :\n\n\nThe addition of organic matter ( FYM / green manure ) helps in\nlowering the pH, improving the soil structure and availability of nitrogen to\nthe crops.\n\n\nThe organic matter is especially helpful where sulphur is added to\ncorrect the alkalinity.\n\n\nSince the organic matter supplies food for the sulphur oxidising\nbacteria and enhances the oxidation of sulphur to sulphuric acid, the\ncombination fo sulphur, organic manure and gypsum can also be used with\nsuccess. \n\n \n\n  Iron sulphate  : \n\n\nIron sulphate is sometimes used as a chemical amendment, which forms\nsulphuric acid on additon to soil.\n\n\nThe sulphuric acid reacts with native and / or added calcium\ncarbonate and form CaSO4 which replaces Na in the clay complex: \nFeSo4 + H2O = H2So4 + Feo H2So4 + Caco3 = Caso4 + H2o + Co2 2 Na-Clay + CaSo4\n= Ca-clay + Na2So4 ( Leached out)\n\n \n\n  Molasses, pressmud and basic slag :  \n\n\nThe use of molasses alongwith pressmud and basic slag is also found\ngood.\n\n\nThe molasses provide the source of energy for micro-organisms which\non fermentation produce organic acids.\n\n\nThe organic acids reduce alkalinity and increase the availability of\nphosphate.\n\n\nThe addition of pressmud, which contains calcium, produces soluble\ncalcium salts that help in reducing exchangeable sodium.\n\n\nUnder conditions of a good supply of available phosphate in the form\nof basic slag, the nitrogen fixation is also benefited. \n\n \n\n  Choice of crops  : \n\n\nGrowing crops tolerant to excess exchangeable sodium can ensure\nreasonable returns during initial phases of reclamation.\n\n\nRice is favoured as the first crop, because it can tolerate standing\nwater and medium levels of ESP and exerts reclamative effect on the soil\nthrough root respiration.\n\n\nWith the judicious management, properly amended alkali soils can\nproduce three to four tonnes of paddy per hectare in the very first year,\nbesides, introducing favourable changes in the physico-chemical soil\nproperties. \n\n \n\nCrop production in salt-affected soils demands managerial skills\nof a higher order turned to the physico-chemical status of the soil.\n\n\nApart from judicious fertilisation, other agronomic practices that\ndemand specific treatment include seed-bed preparation,\nseeding/transplanting, weeding, irrigation, etc. \n\n \n\nThe organic matter content of the alkali soils is often very\nlow.\n\n\nOrganic manures including farmyard manures, \ncompost and green manures have an important place in reclamation of alkali\nsoils. \n\n \n\nGrasses are, in general, more tolerant of alkali conditions than\nmost field crops.\n\n\nAll these can be grown successfully in strongly alkali soils.\n\n\nGrasses also improve the soils so that after a few years other field\ncrops could be taken. \n\n \n\n  Saline Soils  : \n\n\nReclamation of saline soils involves leaching of excess soluble\nsoils from the root zone, lowering of water table below the critical depth,\nselection of suitable crops and their varieties and adoption of agronomic\npractices conforming to the need for keeping root environment safe. \n\n \n\nRemoving the salts that have accumulated on the soil surface by\nthe mechanical means has had a limited success although many farmers resort\nto this procedure.\n\n\nAlthough scraping of salts might temporarily improve crop growth,\nthe ultimate disposal of salts still poses a major problem. \n\n \n\nWashing away the surface accumulation of salts by flushing water\nover the surface is sometimes to desalinize soils having surface salt crust.\n\n\nThis method is not very sound from a practical standpoint because\nthe amount of salt that can be flushed off the soil is rather small. \n\n \n\nLeaching involves removing excess salts to reduce root zone\nsalinity to a desired level.\n\n\nThe efficiency with which salts can be leached per unit of applied\nwater depends upon factors like soil type, characteristics of soil profile,\ndepth of applied water, method of application, absorption and exchange\nreactions during leaching and the initial wetness of the soil.\n\n\nThe amount of salts removed depends entirely on the quantity of\nwater that passes through the soil and depends upon the quality of water used\nfor leaching.\n\n\nLeaching is effective only if the drainage facilities are adequate.\n\n\n \n\nSurface drainage provides an efficient means for lowering water\ntable and to prevent secondary salinization.\n\n\nIn addition to the initial cost of installing a drainage system,\nproblems of disposal of drainage waters could assume serious proportions in\nareas where no natural outlet like sea is available.\n\n\nThis problem can be solved to some extent by ( i) minimising\nleaching of this volume of drainage water, ( ii) disposal of saline drainage\nwater by evaporation in salt pans, collecting drain water in selected areas,\n( iii) using stored drainage waters for brackish water fishculture, and ( iv)\nreuse of such waters with good quality waters for irrigation. \n\n \n\nSalt-affected soils may also contain those salts which are very\ntoxic to plants even at low concentrations.\n\n\nSome salts are not as readily leached out or eliminated as others.\n\n\nSuch peculiar situation must be dealt with after diagnosing the\nproblem.\n\n\nGood post-reclamation management of once salt-affected soils leached\nextremely is important because soil degradation process can again start under\npoor soil and crop management.\n\n\nA close monitoring of soil health to sustain productivity level of\nreclaimed land is necessary.    * \n\n\nJoint Commissioner, Department of Agriculture & Cooperation,\nMinistry of Agriculture, New Delhi.",

Kulkarni whom you and I knew\nso intimately  \nH.B. ( Hemant ) passed away last month at Houston ( USA ) . \n\n\nOf late he had been keeping indifferent health. \n\n\nHe was with his son, Ravi, I presume, when he breathed\nhis last. \n\n\nHe underwent a surgery at Houston for heart trouble\nand died of  \ncardiac arrest a day after the operation. \n\n\nHis co-brother Dr Bidkar gave me this piece of news\nyesterday. \n\n\nI thought that the one person I could immediately\nshare my sorrow   \n  which   was you.  \n\n \n\nH.B. used to visit his son and daughter, one in\nthe USA the other  \nin England off and on but he loved India and had I think\nbought a flat in  \nJuhu. \n\n\nHe was very much attached to \" Hare Krishna\n\"  \nmission, if my impression is correct. \n\n\nHe wrote to me a couple of times inviting me to stay\nwith him. \n\n\nI never could do it. \n\n\nAnd now we shall never see him again, this slim,\nbespectacled,  \ncivilized soul.  \n\n \n\nWhat fun we used to have at Sangli then. \n\n\nRavi was an infant. \n\n\nMrs. K was a hospitable and an    accommodating   person. \n\n\nThen at Hyderabad in 1960 when Prof Gokak was at the\nC.I.E. He was  \nutterly miserable at the University due to internal politics. \n\n\nHe often said that he found solace in my company. \n\n\nI kept on visiting him almost everyday and he used \nto  unfold his agony. \n\n\nAnother year in 1964-65 when I was Research fellow at\nthe C I E. ! \n\n\nHow often we met. \n\n\nThen the storm had not blown over. \n\n\nHe was still unhappy and finally the plunge he took to\nleave the  \ncountry and go to the USA. \n\n\nWhat a loss. \n\n\nH.B. has several vols of poetry in English to his\ncredit.  \n\n \n\nI wonder if we could do something to perpetuate\nhis memory at  \nW.C. \n\n\nIs it possible ?

Pronunciation <*> dotted line</*>\"  and have gone through some \nsections which delighted me by the lucidity and succinctness of your exposition. \n\n\n definitely a book for teachers and careful readers, though I \nwonder how many would make the necessary effort to follow the phonetic symbols. \n\n\nBut  a valuable contribution to the literature on the subject as \nthe distinguished writer of the  introduction has put it. \n\n\nTo me too it brought certain revaluation.  \n\n \n\n \" Worsted\"  in worsted cloth doesn't go with  \" word\" \n or  ` worse'  but is  \" worstid\"  ( Am I \nright  therein ? \n\n\nI don't have your book in front of me now as it has attracted many curious \nreaders who have mislaid it for the present. \n\n\n find it out )  \n\n \n\nAnother point which has long evaded me is whether the following pairs rhyme \nexactly : morning / mourning border / boarder order / odour potter / porter  \n\n \n\nFrom your exposition it would appear that they don't much ( ? ) differ. \n\n\nIt seems you can't take objection to  \" corporation\"  deputising \nfor  \" co operation\"  .  \n\n \n\n    You   could have added an appendix \nshowing certain words which are patently mispronounced;  \n\n\n1.  ` castle'  (  kasling  the King in chess ) \n\n\n2.

{"text": "BIOTECHOLOGY \n\n\n  THE ULTIMATE INTERFACE    \n\n \n\n  THE   tenacity with which the\nbody clings to life is awe inspiring.\n\n\nIt can tolerate the loss of the eyes, ears, teeth, limbs, a lung, much\nof the intestines, the gallbladder, a major part of the liver and a kidney.\n\n\nBut if worse comes to worst, the body would even sacrifice the\nreproductive system, if the life was at stake.\n\n\nThe quality of life plummets with the loss of each organ but at least\nthe person survives.\n\n\nIn survival lies the hope that time may grant the person an\nopportunity to reproduce before death.\n\n\nAnd that is  battle won <*> dotted line</*>\n\n\nAn armoury of special devices and attachements that aid in this fight\nagainst time is now available, thanks to the advances in biology. \n\n \n\nFor long, accident victims, war veterans and surgical amputees\nhave had to come to terms with their handicaps.\n\n\nMay be because of the highly organized and specialized tissue\narchitecture, human beings do not have the power of regeneration.\n\n\nA limb lost is lost forever !\n\n\nOn this one count earthworms and the lowly planarian flat worms\nare more privileged than humans !\n\n\nTo make up for this handicap many prosthetic devices and aids have\nbeen fashioned by man.\n\n\nSpare parts that can   replace any crippled organ in the body are now\navailable.\n\n\nInitially these were clumsy, cumbersome and crude.\n\n\nBut no longer !\n\n\nThe quiet revolution that has characterized the last few years of the\ndying century has changed all this.\n\n\nBiomaterials are the low profile standard bearers of this\nscientific advance that seeks to reconstruct or restore the lost or impaired\nfunctions of the body.\n\n\nThus while man cannot sprout new organs to compensate for lost ones,\nhe is, technologically speaking, just one step short of it.\n\n\nThe list of implantable devices to overcome a deficit is growing.\n\n\nOf course one cannot saunter into the supermarket to pick up a\nspare part from the shelves, not yet.\n\n\nBut the use of certain artificially made, biologically compatible\ndevices that help overcome an impairment is rapidly growing.\n\n\nOf these, hip replacements, contact and intraocular lenses and\nheart pace makers are so commonly used that they do not even excite\ncuriosity. \n\n \n\nHowever, irrespective of how simple or how common they are, all\nimplantable devices face two problems.\n\n\nThe first is that    the body is uncompromisingly hostile to anything it senses as\n \" foreign\"  .\n\n\nAgainst things so labelled, the body unleashes all the aggressive\npower its defense system can command.\n\n\nAlthough the immunological rejection processes that occur with\norgan transplants do not occur with the same severity with synthetic\nmaterials, certain complications do arise.\n\n\nThe interface of a functionally acceptable biomaterial with living\ntissue may serve as a site subject to aggression by the \ndefense system.\n\n\nUnder the circumstances, a complex series of reactions is set up\nresulting in inflammation of the tissues.\n\n\nThe second problem, of course, is that of replacing the living,\norganized, dynamically responsive and complex tissues with nonliving and\nunresponsive synthetic materials. \n\n \n\nCertain materials have been formulated which can help bypass\nthese problems.\n\n\nThe amalgams used to replace tooth dentine, polymethylmethacrylate\nin the intraocular lenses for the eye and the titanium replacement for\nthigh bones are some examples. \n\n \n\nThe basic concept behind the creation of artificial organs can be\ndated back to ancient men who first used wooden crutches for amputated limbs.\n\n\nAfter years of refinement, artificial arms, legs, teeth and aids for\ndefective vision became available.\n\n\nThe 1940s and 1950s witnessed the development of the first\nartificial kidney and heart-lung bypass machines.\n\n\nToday several diverse fields such as chemistry, computers,\nelectronics, medicine and materials sciences are collaborating to form a\ntotally new discipline which can be called bioengineering. \n\n \n\nBioengineering is a real ray of hope for the physically\ncompromised.\n\n\nTake the case of a defective eye.\n\n\nThe eye is one of the most delicate and complex organs in the body.\n\n\nSurgically it is readily accessible but the complexity of tears mean\nthat synthetic materials to be used in the eye need to have very special\nproperties.\n\n\nHydrogels have considerable potential in ophthalmic applications.\n\n\nA detached retina can be re-attached to the choroid - - its source\nof nutrition, by using a silicone rubber implant.\n\n\nA polyhydrogel implant, however, has additional advantages over\nsilicone rubber.\n\n\nThe material is soft, and unlike silicone rubber, it can be\nimpregnated with an antibiotic that can prevent post-operative infection.\n\n\nHydrogel coating on polymethylmethacrylate ( PMMA ) lenses has\nmade them more acceptable and improves their biocompatibility as well as\ntheir flexibility.\n\n\nThe flexibility of hydrogels means that the lenses can be folded and\ninserted through a much smaller incision that would be necessary for a\nconventional 'hard lens'.\n\n\nHydrogel impregnated lens can even be inserted while dehydrated\nand allowed to hydrate in the eye. \n\n \n\nA bright ray which is expected to illuminate the dark world of\nthe blind is the progress made by the artificial eye project headed by\nWilliam Dobelle, a physiologist and the Director, Artificial Organs Division\nat Columbia University, USA.\n\n\nThe artificial eye being developed here is based on direct electrical\nstimulation of points in the visual cortex of the brain.\n\n\nPlatinum electrodes are arranged on a thin plate made of Teflon,\nwhich is inserted in a fold of the brain.\n\n\nEach time a points is stimulated by a minute electrical charge, a dot\nof light appears in the visual field of the blind volunteer. \n\n \n\nThe array used at present consists of 8 rows of 8 electrodes\nwhich give very fuzzy images ( 64 in all ) .\n\n\nBut future arrays will have hundreds of electrodes, and allow the\nblind to visualize pictures.\n\n\nThe current 64-array system allows the user to read Braille by seeing\nrather than by feeling the letters.\n\n\nDespite advances, this system has one drawback.\n\n\nThere is no correlation between the area of the visual cortex being\nstimulated and the location of the dot of light in the \nvisual field.\n\n\nThus, every user must have his visual cortex mapped.\n\n\nBut once the map is completed, information is transmitted\nregularly to the used.\n\n\nIn addition to a more advanced electrode array and neurophysiological\ndata needed to stimulate the brain, future advances will incorporate the use\nof viewing devices along the lines of a miniature TV camera and a mini\ncomputer to translate what the viewing device sees into the proper\nstimulation pattern for the visual cortex to perceive.\n\n\nThe National Science Foundation in the USA has also been working to\ndevise photosensitive biochips into the visual cortex of the brain.\n\n\nA biochip is the cousin of the silicon chip and like it contains a\ncomplex electronic circuit.\n\n\nBut the signals in a biochip are individual electrons shunting\nbetween organic molecules.\n\n\nBiochips are minute, function at extremely low power, at the\nmolecular level and yet are enormously complex and sophisticated.\n\n\nBiochips are made out of natural substances such as proteins and\nit is possible that they might form their own linkages with other organs,\nonce implanted.\n\n\nThis would help form links with the body and perform more varied\nfunctions while in place. \n\n \n\nThe artificial eye has also encouraged researchers to\nexperimentally produce an artificial ear as well.\n\n\nThis model provides electrical stimulation of the inner ear.\n\n\nBut developing an analogue for normal ears is not as easy as it\nsounds.\n\n\nFor one, the perceived pitch of a sound can be affected both by the\nplacement of the electrode in the  inner ear as well\nas by the frequency of the electrical stimulation. \n\n \n\nExtremely promising advances have been made in the field of\nartificial limbs.\n\n\nArtificial limbs have been used for centuries and the Jaipur limb is\njustly famous.\n\n\nBut truly electrifying progress, using light weight yet strong\nmaterials together with miniaturized electric motors controlled by\nmicrocomputers, have been made recently. \n\n \n\nAn experimental model has electrodes that can be attached to the\nnerves sent by the central nervous system to control the movement of the\nmuscles of the limb now lost.\n\n\nThese myoelectric signals are converted by a microcomputer into\ncontrols for small electric motors that power the artificial arm.\n\n\nThus an imputee can move his artificial arm by just willing himself\nto carry out the action. \n\n \n\nFinger joints made of Silastic ( a composite of silicone and\nplastics ) can be implanted in any finger and these have normal bending\nability.\n\n\nArtificial skin available in various colour tones can cover the limbs\nand the circuitry involved.\n\n\nThe artificial skin also simulates the appearance of natural human\nskin. \n\n \n\nCertain organs too stand to be aided by artificial support\nsystems should they be weakened or failing.\n\n\nThe pancreas, for example, secretes insulin that helps regulate blood\nsugar levels of the body.  \n\n\nThe results of a pancreas functioning below par and that of a\npancreatectomy following cancer are the same.\n\n\nVictims usually become dependent on daily doses of insulin.\n\n\nBioengineers are developing artificial pancreas for them.\n\n\nWhile these man-made pancreas will not completely reproduce the\nfunctions of the natural pancreas, it will automatically provide the\ncorrect amount of insulin whenever the need arises.\n\n\nArtificial pancreas consist of a glucose sensor, a pump and an\ninsulin supply.\n\n\nWhen the glucose level in the blood rises to a predetermined level,\nthe sensor activates the pump.\n\n\nThe pump then injects insulin into the blood stream.\n\n\nProto-types of artifical pancreases have already been tested\nsuccessfully in human volunteers and long term implantable versions are\nbeing perfected. \n\n \n\nArtificial kidneys or dialysis machines are of course not new.\n\n\nThey have been used for patients with kidney failure for more than 30\nyears.\n\n\nThese machines replace the filtering function of the natural kidneys.\n\n\nDuring dialysis, the  blood is pumped over a\nmemberane on the other side of which is a dialysis fluid.\n\n\nWaste materials present in the blood can cross the membrane and enter\nthe dialysis fluid.\n\n\nFollowing dialysis, the blood is returned into the body.\n\n\nGenerally, dialysis requires that the patient be attached to bulky\nequipment for long hours every week.\n\n\nSmall kidneys have been developed, but even this involves the use of\na large liquid container.\n\n\nThese small kidneys use a technique called hemoperfusion.\n\n\nIn this, blood is passed over substances such as coated charcoal or\nresin.\n\n\nEven portable versions of small kidneys are available for use during\njourneys but the smaller artificial kidneys do not remove enough of urea, the\nwaste chemical, for a completely wearable artificial kidney to be\nprescribed. \n\n \n\nThe liver is yet another extremely important gland in the body.\n\n\nIt accounts for about 2 per cent of the  weight and\ntakes part in myriad functions.\n\n\nMany toxic substances in the body are detoxified by the liver.\n\n\nSo when the liver fails, the life of a patient may be in jeopardy.\n\n\nNow external liver-assist devices or \" ELADs \" may\nbe pressed into service.\n\n\nThe simplest \" ELAD \" works like kidney dialysis\nmachines.\n\n\nA bundle of hollow fibres made out of a filter like membrane is\nplaced in a canister.\n\n\nLiver cells or hepatocytes taken from pigs coat the outside of\neach fibre.\n\n\nAs the  blood flows through the fibres, it\nexchanges chemicals, gives up waste products and receives nutrients.\n\n\nThe problem with \" ELAD \" was to sustain the\nhepatocytes since these cells are fussy about the environment they need when\nbeing grown outside the body.\n\n\nOther researchers have tried to solve this problem by providing\nthe hepatocytes with nutrients.\n\n\nWell nourished hepatocytes are logically expected to carry out\ntheir functions better.\n\n\nRat hepatocytes are packed inside the hollow fibres and fed by\nsupplementary nutrients while blood runs through the gaps between the\nstrands.\n\n\nThis liver aid device was recently tested on rabbits which had\nhad their livers removed.\n\n\nThe \" ELAD \" gave the liverless rabbits a second\nlease on life for 36 hours.\n\n\nIf the experimental studies on dogs too go as expected, human\ntrials should start soon after that. \n\n \n\nIn an advanced model of the liver aid devices the plasma is\nseparated from the  blood and pumped through the pig\nhepatocytes.\n\n\nIt is then passed over an activated charcoal filter before being\nmixed with the cellular portion of the blood.\n\n\nThe reconstituted blood is returned to the body.\n\n\nAchilles A. Demetriou, a surgeon at the Cedars Sinai Medical Centre\nin Los Angeles used this \" ELAD \" on ten patients to bring\nback eight of them from  door.\n\n\nThese patients had been so ill and moribund that they had been\ndisqualified as potential recipients of liver grafts. \n\n \n\nThere is one problem common to devices such as these.\n\n\nThey all need to have some connection between the  body and the power source or controlling unit outside the body.\n\n\nIn case of dialysis machines, a fairly \n  large sized blood vessel is needed to\nwhich the device can be hooked.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d1719ca5-6ea3-4231-abc6-eab59ac836c4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.209286+00:00"}
{"text": "Continuing Scandal  \n\n \n\nThe parliamentary debate on what opposition parties have called\nthe  \" sugar scandal\"  has been neither illuminative nor\npurposeful.\n\n\nWhile the opposition members levelled allegations without doing much\nhomework, the Union minister of state for food, Mr Kalpanath Rai, offered an\nuntenable defence of his inept performance, or deliberate manipulation, as\nsome would say, passing the buck to his officials.\n\n\nIf it was really the  fault, Parliament should have\nbeen informed what action has been taken against them.\n\n\nIf not, it is patently unfair to blame them when government rules do\nnot permit civil servants to defend themselves in public.\n\n\nIt is also unfortunate that the Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao,\nshould have chosen to keep quiet when a member of his council of ministers\nwas unabashedly passing the blame on to the officials.\n\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the steep increase in sugar prices is\npartly the result of ineptitude in management, for which Mr Rai, the\nofficials of his ministry and the officials of other ministries and\ngovernment agencies, like the State Trading Corporation and the Minerals and\nMetals Trading Corporation, are all equally responsible.\n\n\nThe crisis is not, however, just the result of poor management.\n\n\nIt has also been caused by deliberate manipulation of monthly\nreleases, delayed imports and the complex licence-quota system which still\noperates in the sugar mill industry.\n\n\nHence, the opposition charge that the  \" crisis\"  is a\n \" scandal\" \n\n\nIn this respect, Mr Rai has more to explain than what he has cared to\ndo so far. \n\n \n\nThis is not the first time, however, that the potent combination\nof sugar and politics has embarassed a government.\n\n\nIt will not be the last either, unless sugar is decontrolled like all\nother major consumer goods.\n\n\nIndeed, there is no reason why the licensing and production and\ndistribution controls should continue.\n\n\nInstead, a buffer stock must be maintained to regulate the impact of\noutput fluctuations on price.\n\n\nAny concern about the rising sugar prices does not mean that sugar is\nan essential commodity.\n\n\nBut the point is that consumers have been put to hardship needlessly.\n\n\nThe recent spurt in prices has to be adequately probed and those\nguilty punished.\n\n\nOtherwise, the public perception of a scandal involving mainly\npoliticians will persist and even gain in strength.\n\n\nEven at this late stage the government can act to push sugar prices\ndown by increasing the levy quota, forcing mills to part with more sugar for\nthe public distribution system and allowing them to sell imported sugar at\nmarket-determined prices without any ceiling on the free market price.\n\n\nSimultaneously, the government will also have to ensure that all\nthose who have LPG connections are denied access to rationed sugar.\n\n\nThe rationalisation of the PDS can begin with sugar and\ncross-subsidisation will save the exchequer the burden of a higher food\nsubsidy.  <*> a dark line in the middle </*>\n\n\n  Toward European Unity  \n\n \n\nThe results of last  elections to the European\nParliament confirm two trends: apathy towards the European Union and\ndisillusionment with national governments.\n\n\nAs during the voting on the Maastricht treaty, the electorate turned\nthe elections into a referendum on the ruling parties.\n\n\nThe biggest losers were the Conservatives in Britain, where Mr John\nMajor is facing a crisis of confidence, and the Socialists in Spain, where Mr\nFelipe Gonzalez was made to pay the price for rising unemployment and a spate\nof political scandals.\n\n\nThe fact that the winners in these two countries were from opposite\nends of the political spectrum - - Labour in Britain and the right-wing\nPopular Party in Spain - - shows that voters were more concerned with\ncensuring their governments than with the cohesiveness of the European Union.\n\n\nA notable exception to the trend was Germany, where the surprisingly\nstrong showing by Chancellor Helmut  ruling centre-right\nChristian Democrats will boost their chances in the national elections\nlater this year.\n\n\nSimilarly, Mr Silvio  fledgling conservative\ngovernment won a powerful vote of support in Italy, although the poor voter\nturn-out signalled that recession and the recent political upheavals have\ndampened the  traditional ardour for a federal Europe. \n\n \n\nAlthough extreme right-wingers faced badly in Germany and Itali,\ntheir gains in France and Belgium show that their anti-Europe and\nanti-foreign agenda still has some support.\n\n\nOn balance, however, the results have favoured the mainstream\npolitical parties, providing fresh impetus to the European Union which is\ntrying to forge a common foreign policy and introduce a single currency by\n1999.\n\n\nIn fact, the elections mark a significant stage in the transition of\nthe European Union to a more inclusive post-cold War entity, with opening of\nits doors to the contries of the north and west along with closer links with\nthe east.\n\n\nNevertheless, the continuing gulf netween Euro-sceptics and\nEuro-enthusiasts suggests that individual governments have failed to gain\npublic endorsement for their ideal to the extent they desire.\n\n\nThe proposals for a  ` multi-speed'  Europe are a\nresponse to popular fears of the social and economic consequences of\nunity.  <*> a dark line in the middle </*>   Dark Side of Disney\n \n\n \n\nIt is a truism that every dream whispers, in suitably disguised\nintonations, the  most compelling hopes and fears.\n\n\nOnly to a few dreamers, visionaries or madmen, however, does the\nmoment come when they can superimpose their fantasies on the terrors and\nambitions of their compatriots.\n\n\nIt is then that national myths are born.\n\n\nOne such was Walt Disney.\n\n\nThrough the technical wizardry and visual delight of his cartoon\nfilms, he invited America to participate in his songs of innocence and\nexperience, to re-fashion itself in his wonderland.\n\n\nIf Disney was Peter Pan, the eternal youth, then so, by implication,\nwas America; if Disney was Pinocchio, the truant boy who discovered\nhimself in the proecss of running away, or Snow White, who emerged triumphant\nthrough tribulation, then these were also archetypal narratives of  progress.\n\n\nDisney played a crucial role in promoting the great white American\ndream, pulling millions of viewers through the travails of the Great\nDepression and World War II.\n\n\nIt has, however, long been known that the fairy tale pageant masked a\nbrooding darkness; that the magic of  romances hid an\nintransigent racist, an inconsiderate husband, an alcoholic who suffered from\nchronic depression, a stern moralist who was plagued by the suspicion that he\nhad been the illegitimate child of a Spanish washer-woman.\n\n\nIn a recent biography,  Walt Disney:  Dark\nPrince  , Marc Eliot uncovers further damaging facts about the creator\nof Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy.\n\n\nIt is saddening to learn, for instance, that Disney was, from 1940\ntill his death in 1967, an informer for the FBI, who monitored his\ncolleagues.\n\n\nHe was instrumental in letting Senator  infamous\nUn-American Activities Committee loose in Hollywood, one result of which\nexercise was the exile of Charlie Chaplin.\n\n\nThis was ironic:  tramps had been \nfirst inspiration, and Mickey mouse had been conceived as a tribute to the\nlegendary comedian.\n\n\nIndeed, it is tragic that in his disastrous demonstration of loyalty\nto the nation, Disney betrayed and helped destroy the old Hollywood. \n\n\n\n\n\n  Only The Small Fry  \n\n \n\nEven as Sanjay  arrest has again focussed\nattention on the inquiry into the Bombay blasts case, the feeling has\nremained that the forthcoming trial of more than 190 people may be something\nof an anti-climax.\n\n\nThe reason obviously is that the authorities have been unable to lay\ntheir hands on any of the principal actors who have been held primarily\nresponsible for the outrage.\n\n\nMore than 20 of them, including the prime suspects Dawood Ibrahim and\nAbdul Razak  \" Tiger\"  Memon, have been absconding for more\nthan a year, and the government has met with no success in persuading those\ncountries which are believed to be sheltering them to offer any kind of\nco-operation.\n\n\nIndeed, there is no certainty as to where exactly these guilty men\nare hiding.\n\n\nIn their absence, the court would be seen to be dealing with only the\nsmall fry who did not have the resources to flee or the clout to find willing\npatrons abroad to shelter them.\n\n\nThe only good news in this context is Mr S.B. \nassurance that notifications will be issued to attach Dawood  properties in Bombay and elsewhere, but even this announcement will\nbe seen to be a fall-out from the G.R. Khairnar episode.\n\n\nIn fact, since the CBI had been entrusted with the responsibility of\nattaching these properties several months ago, the question may be asked why\nnothing was done till the matter acquired a political dimension in the wake\nof Mr  courageous anti-corruption campaign.\n\n\nIt can be argued that the ruling  internal power\nstruggles between the supporters and opponents of Mr Sharad Pawar have played\na crucial role in expediting official action on this score. \n\n \n\nThe run-up to the trial has been marked by the unfortunate\nepisode where a number of lawyers expressed their lack of confidence in\nthe special judge, Mr J.N. Patel.\n\n\nSuch incidents are, of course, not unknown in democratic societies,\nbut they almost always tend to cast a shadow over the proceedings and detract\nfrom judicial dignity.\n\n\nIt will be a matter of regret if this happens in what is one of the\nmajor trials of conspirators accused of  \" waging war\"  on the\ncountry in the post-independence period.\n\n\nEven if the big fish have escaped, the trial should still give some\nidea of the nature and extent of the conspiracy and the role of foreign\npowers.\n\n\nIn addition, it should reveal the loopholes in \nsecurity system which made it easy for the criminals to smuggle in arms and\nammunition from abroad.\n\n\nIn one respect, however, the authorities will have to be extra\nvigilant during the period of the trial.\n\n\nThey must ensure that no organisation or influential individual is\nable to use the occasion to foment communal sentiments.\n\n\nOne of the objectives of the conspirators, according to the\ncharge-sheet against them, was to engineer communal riots.\n\n\nThis aim must not succeed even when they are behind bars or are\nabsconding.  <*> a dark line in the middle </*>\n\n\n  Matter of Concern  \n\n \n\nOne swallow does not make a summer.\n\n\nSo the fact that the rate of growth of exports has decelerated from\naround 20 per cent in 1993-94 to just nine per cent, on a point-to-point\nbasis, in April-May 1994 over April-May 1993, should not cause despair.\n\n\nThe deceleration is serious enough, however, to warrant urgent\naction.\n\n\nAdmittedly, point-to-point comparisons can be misleading,\nespecially if there are random fluctuations in the course of the year.\n\n\nSince there is no reason to believe that there is a set seasonal\npattern in the movement of exports, it will be hasty to jump to conclusions\nabout the annual trend on the basis of the first two \nperformance.\n\n\nEven then, it is a matter of concern that such a dramatic\nreduction should have occurred.\n\n\nClearly, the government and businessmen must examine the underlying\nfactors and offer an explanation.\n\n\nOne important factor that may have contributed to a decline in\nexports is the revival of economic activity at home after two years of\nnear-stagnation in national income.\n\n\nSecondly, the return of double-digit inflation, even when the\nexternal value of the  rupee  has been held in check through\nmarket intervention by the Reserve Bank of India, has made exports less\ncompetitive.\n\n\nThirdly, it has been suggested by the commerce ministry that the\nwithdrawal of the price reimbursement scheme for engineering goods exporters\nfrom April 1 may have hit exports adversely.\n\n\nThis should be immediately re-examined by the Union commerce and\nfinance ministries. \n\n \n\nThe main reason, however, is that neither the government nor\ndomestic business paid enough attention to ensure a sustained increase in\nexports.\n\n\nDespite the persisting seriousness of the long-term balance of\npayments scenario, given  debt repayment obligations and its\nneed for imports to fuel industrial growth, action on the ground has been\nslow and halting.\n\n\nLittle has been done so far to deal with the painful infrastructural\nbottlenecks at the ports.\n\n\nThe corruption and inefficiency in customs and port handling\nfacilities have merely been dealt with on the surface.\n\n\nThe so-called action plans and corporate targets have not helped\nalter the basic profile of Indian exports which continues to be dominated by\n ` traditional goods'  like gems and jewellery, garments and\nso on.\n\n\nOne silver lining is the prospect of improved trade between India and\nRussia.\n\n\nThe visit of the Indian Prime Minister has helped ease the two-way\ntrade, especially in commodities like tobacco and tea.\n\n\nThe potential is much bigger than what India can handle at the\nmoment, given supply-side bottlenecks.\n\n\nFaced with such disappointing news from the export front, the\ngovernment might be tempted to resort to rash tactics like easing\nagricultural and raw material exports.\n\n\nWhile some of this is necessary, any export drive must keep an eye on\nthe domestic price line.  <*> a dark line in the middle </*>\n\n\n  Sitting Ducks  \n\n \n\n \" How many grave speeches, which have surprised, shocked\nand directed the nation, have been made by great leaders too soon after a\nnoble dinner, duly winged by the press - - but without an accompanying\nbanquet menu and a supplementary wine list?\"  observed the writer,\nH.M.

{"text": "HEALTH & FITNESS   \n\n\n STROKES   \n\n \n\n  Thickened inner lining of a major artery in the brain\n      \n\n \n\n  STROKE   represents the most\ncommon and devastating disease of the central nervous system.\n\n\nThe third leading cause of death in the developed countries, it\naccounts for a large number of hospital admissions in India as well.\n\n\nHowever, if the public is made sufficiently aware of stroke and its\ncauses, they will be able to use existing medical facilities optimally, to\nprevent and delay its premature occurrence, disabilities and death. \n\n \n\nStroke is also referred to as a cerebro vascular accident.\n\n\nAcute cerebrovascular disease is defined by the World Health\nOrganization as  \" Rapidly developed clinical signs of a focal\ndisturbance of cerebral function of presumed vascular origin and of\nmore than twenty-four hours duration.\"  \n\n \n\nThere are two major sub-groups of stroke based on their causes.\n\n\nStroke can result from a reduction or temporary cessation of blood\nsupply to the brain.\n\n\nThis is called ischemia.\n\n\nStrokes can also arise due to bleeding within the brain or its\ncovering membranes, known as haemorrhaging. \n\n \n\nThe brain is supplied with blood carried by two arterial\nsystems consisting of the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries\nand the vertebral and basilar arteries.\n\n\nThere are enough anatomical connections and regulatory mechanisms\nbetween the two systems to ensure efficient blood supply.\n\n\nThe brain requires a rich blood supply containing adequate oxygen and\nglucose and other essential metabolites.\n\n\nThe reduction in blood supply can be general or local, transient and\nincomplete, or prolonged and complete.\n\n\nIf the deprivation is incomplete and persists for less than ten\nminutes, death of nerve or brain tissue does not occur.\n\n\nIf complete and prolonged, it results in death of tissue termed as\ninfarction.\n\n\nThe site and extent of the infarction determines whether the\ndisability is to be mild or severe and whether the event is going to be\nfatal. \n\n \n\nThere are several reasons for reduced blood supply, the main\nbeing the narrowing of the intra- and extra-cranial arteries supplying the\nbrain, due to a process of thickening and stiffening of the blood vessels (\natherosclerosis).\n\n\nApart from these changes  involving local\nblood vessels, conditions which alter the rhythm of the heart and reduce\nblood pressure can cause a reduction in blood supply to the brain.\n\n\nBlood clots can obstruct the cerebral blood vessels and cause tissue\ndeath ( infarcts).\n\n\nBesides, the blood itself may thicken and become more viscous\ncontributing to sluggish flow, clot formation and eventual obstruction.\n\n\n\n  Intra-cranial bleeding  \n\n \n\nOne in every four to six strokes is an intra-cranial haemorrhage.\n\n\nBleeding can take place inside the substance of brain in which case\nit is known as intraparenchymal haemorrhage.\n\n\nIt can also occur under the covering of the brain, a condition called\nsub-arachnoid haemorrhage.\n\n\nSometimes, this type of haemorrhage extends into the cavity of the\nbrain and is called intraventricular haemorrhage.\n\n\nBlood, when it flows through blood vessels is essential, as it\ncontains life-supporting oxygen and glucose.\n\n\nHowever, when it leaks out of the cerebral blood vessels, it\nirritates and destroys the brain tissue.\n\n\nAn expanding blood clot and the swollen tissue surrounding it\ncompress normal brain tissues, as the volume of the skull is fixed.\n\n\nWhen the vital structures of the brain stem are compressed, a\nprofound loss of consciousness, respiratory difficulties and even death\ncan result.   \n\n \n\n  CT scan showing an infarct ( black portion) \n \n\n \n\nIndications of inadequate blood supply to the brain depend on the\nsite of the lesion.\n\n\nCommon symptoms include visual impairment or loss of sight in one\neye, weakness in an arm and / or leg, weakness of the facial muscles,\ndifficulty in speech or inability to speak and abnormal sensations in the\narms and face.\n\n\nOther symptoms are intense giddiness, double vision, fits and\nheadaches.\n\n\nIntense headaches, vomiting and loss of consciousness indicate a\nmore serious injury and are often fatal.\n\n\nIschemic strokes, that is, strokes due to diminished blood supply,\nare of three types, differentiated on the basis of the temporal onset.\n\n\nThese are: transient ischemic attacks ( TIAS), which cause a\nneurological deficit lasting for less than 24 hours, progressive\nstroke, and completed stroke. \n\n \n\nIt is very important that the patient pays enough attention to\ntransient short-term symptoms and seeks medical care for them.\n\n\nThis is so because such symptoms are warning signals for the\npotential danger of a full stroke.\n\n\nIt is estimated that after the first warning symptom there is a\nfive to six per cent chance per year of a stroke recurring.\n\n\nAggressive investigations and treatment are required even for\npatients with early warning symptoms. \n\n\n  Risk Factors  \n\n \n\nThe causes of stroke in some ways might vary from country to\ncountry.\n\n\nThe risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus,\nhyperlipoproteinaemia ( presence of excess fat-protein complexes in the\nblood), smoking, previous TIAS, coronary artery disease and a sedentary\nlife-style, stress and obesity.\n\n\nIn India, modernization and industrialization have introduced\nstressful life-styles which have contributed to a rising incidence of\nhypertension and atheroscelerosis.\n\n\nHowever, rheumatic heart disease; infective endocarditis (\ninflammation of the heart lining and its valves due to infection);\ntuberculosis of the blood vessels; post-delivery venous disease; anaemia\nand sickle cell disease are equally important causes. \n\n \n\nAnother important aspect is the phase of life in which stroke\noccurs.\n\n\nAfter eighty, the chances of having a stroke are enhanced because the\narteries generally harden at this phase of life, even if heart disease,\ncancer and trauma have not yet taken their toll.\n\n\nHypertension and diabetes both individually and together hasten the\ntempo of the atherosclerotic process and might precipitate a stroke as early\nas in the fifties or sixties.\n\n\nStrokes occurring in people less than 40 years of age, are known as\npremature strokes.\n\n\nThey can be averted by recognizing, identifying and tackling the\ncausative factors. \n\n \n\nIn the West, the incidence of strokes and the resulting mortality\nhas declined by more than 40 per cent, while    the long-term survival rate has\nimproved by more than 60 per cent over the last three decades.\n\n\nThis has been possible largely because of early identification,\nregular treatment of hypertension and an awareness of the longterm\nill-effects of hypertension.\n\n\nThis appears to be a very important lesson for developing countries\nwhere the incidence of hypertension appears to be rising and a decline in\nthe incidence of strokes is not evident. \n\n\n  Investigations  \n\n \n\nIn most cases, the diagnosis of a complete stroke can be made\neven by a layman.\n\n\nHowever, accurate diagnosis needs to be made by the doctor in less\ntypical cases.\n\n\nSeveral investigative facilities help in the accurate\nidentification of the location and the extent of stroke and the time at\nwhich the infarct or haemorrhage occurs.\n\n\nComputerized tomography ( CT) scans of the brain, carotid\nangiography, the digital substraction technique, neuroimaging techniques\nsuch as magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI), single positron emission\ncomputerized tomography ( SPECT), positron emission tomography ( PET) and\ntrans-cranial colour-coded real-time sonography and flow-imaging, colour\nDoppler flow-imaging and radionuclide angiography help us know more about\nthe total and regional blood-flow and about obstructions to the normal and\naffected brain.\n\n\nNot all investigations are necessary in every case, besides some may\nbe available only in major teaching hospitals and research centres.\n\n\nThe investigations help a doctor  to\ndecide the mode of therapy. \n\n \n\nPlatelets in blood play an important role in clot formation which\nin turn obstructs brain arteries.\n\n\nDrugs which prevent platelet aggregation have been extensively\nstudied and used. \n\n \n\nAspirin is a very important drug in the treatment of TIAS as well\nas for prevention of stroke recurrence.\n\n\nDipyridamol and sulphinpyrazone are other agents used.\n\n\nTiclopidine is a newer agent which acts on the platelet membrane.\n\n\nAnti-coagulants are sometimes useful to treat and prevent worsening\nin very early stages of acute strokes.\n\n\nThrombolytic therapy which has been revolutionary in coronary artery\ndisease is in a trial stage and may prove useful for treating strokes as\nwell. \n\n \n\nPentoxifyllin is one drug which finds application on account of\nits property of reducing blood thickness, low molecular weight dextran also\ncauses haemodilution ( thinning of the blood). \n\n \n\nIn some carefully selected patients extra-cranial or\nintra-cranial by-pass operations can be performed. \n\n \n\nThe agents which reduce the brain swelling and resulting cranial\npressure are - - mannitol; dexamethasone; a corticosteroid, and, glycerol.\n\n\nThe blood clot can be surgically aspirated in only a few selected\npatients with haemorrhage. \n\n\n  Rehabilitation  \n\n \n\nTo the patients who were previously physically independent,\nstroke may turn out to be an illness worse than death itself.\n\n\nImpaired movements and mobility, affected vision and speech\nrepresents an end to an useful life.\n\n\nDementia occurs in a sizeable number of stroke patients.\n\n\nDepression following a stroke is a frequent problem which interferes\nwith rehabilitation. \n\n \n\nCommunication deficits, weakness in the hands and legs and\ndifficulty in carrying out daily activities are the major handicaps which a\nstroke patients faces.\n\n\nOften a loss of occupation results in economic dependence.\n\n\nThe  attitudes, life satisfaction and well-being\nchange profoundly and adjustment with family or friends becomes difficult\nor impossible. \n\n \n\nPatients recovering from a stroke should be made aware of the\nimportance of physiotherapy in preventing muscular contractures and\nwasting due to disuse, which sometimes occur due to paralysis following a\nstroke.\n\n\nThe average duration of hospitalization is two to three weeks.\n\n\nIn developed countries, institutionalized care is available to a\nlarge number of patients.\n\n\nHowver, an early discharge and return to the family and community\nis advisable to promote favourable changes in personal, physical and\npsychological behaviour.\n\n\nBiofeedback methods like electromyography ( EMG) are used to retrain\nmuscles affected by stroke.\n\n\nEMG involves the use of instruments to visually or audibly record\nthe electrical activity of skeletal muscle as a means of diagnosing\nneuromuscular disorders and in biofeedback training.\n\n\nA caring spouse or attendant can play a major role in early physical\nrecovery, ormities.\n\n\nDrugs such as aspirin, ibubrcovery is an important pre-requisite\nfor early physical recovery.   \n\n \n\n Modernization and industrialization have introduced\nstressful life-styles which have contributed to a rising incidence of\nhypertension   \n\n \n\n  Depression following a stroke is a frequent\nproblem which interferes with rehabilitation", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "Forster and Further   \n\n\n\n Sujit Mukherjee \n\n \n\nWHATEVER final resting place is accorded to E.M. Forster in the\nhistory of the British novel, he will always occupy a rather unique position\nin the development of Anglo-Indian fiction.\n\n\nIt has been suggested  that Indian fiction\nwritten in English ( or  ` Indo-Anglian'  fiction, as it used\nto be called; since then,  ` Indian English'  fiction) must\nhave had at the back of its growth the inspiration of \nfamous novel on India.\n\n\nMore important than the connection between Forster and the growing\nIndian practice of writing novels in English is the fact that it was \n\" A Passage to India \"  ( 1924) which summed up and at\nthe same time gave long life to the tradition of Anglo-Indian fiction.\n\n\nThis longevity embraced not only the novels that have come after but\nalso those which preceded it because  novel enables us to\nlook both ways and find links that were waiting to be  ` only\nconnected'  . \n\n \n\nBefore proceeding, let us clarify what is meant by  `\nAngloIndian fiction'  .\n\n\nBhupal Singh suggested three possibilities:  \" Broadly speaking\nit includes any novel dealing with India which is written in English, it\nmeans fiction mainly describing the life of Englishmen in India.\n\n\nIn a still narrower sense it may be taken to mean novels dealing with\nthe life of Eurasians, who now prefer to be called Anglo-Indians.\" \n\n\n\nHalf a century later the first of these specifications will serve our\npurpose best, once we have qualified it by the condition that the authors of\nsuch novels must necessarily be non-Indians.\n\n\nIt is a tradition in the sense it has endured for many years now\n , has generated \ndemonstrable inter-action between authors as well as between books, and has\nperiodically renewed itself opening up new possibilities. \n\n \n\nIt is on this third issue that Forster is so important for\nAngloIndian fiction.\n\n\n \" A passage to India \"  is the first clear\nintimation in literature of the mortality of British rule in India.\n\n\nThat intimation released all intelligent aftercomers to the\ntradition from the obligation of having to justify the ways of British India\nto the English-reading world.\n\n\nThese aftercomers were thus freed to explore and interpret other\naspects of Indo-British relations, and thereby gave the tradition extension\nin time far beyond the formal termination of the British empire in India.\n\n\nAlso, given the above-mentioned definition, the tradition has always\nbeen open to any English-writing foreigner - - Americans  Australian, Canadian  and the like - - who encountered India and subsequently transcribed\nthis experience in fiction. \n\n \n\nThe 1974 reprint of Bhupal   \" A\nSurvey of Anglo-Indian Fiction \"  carries an anonymous foreword\nwherein it is stated  \" Anglo-Indian fiction came to an end when the\nBritish withdrew from India\"  .\n\n\nThe definition that has been accepted above refutes this statement.\n\n\nThe British may have withdrawn from India in 1974 but interest in\nBritish India continues to prosper  in fiction,\ncinema and in television serials based on novels.\n\n\nWe may note in this connection that while Anglo-Indian fiction has\nensured a long run for itself by outliving its original impulses, other\nEuropean nations that had engaged in colonial ventures in modern times did\nnot produce related literature of such long standing and large bulk as\nBritain did.\n\n\nHugh Ridley has, in  \" drawing the attention of\nEnglish-speaking readers to the colonial fiction of France and Germany,  \"\n   shown how different the literary\noutcomes of such impulses were in these two countries.\n\n\nThe French, for example, pioneered stories of travel to exotic lands\nand the experience of living there - - the earliest example being Bernardin\nde St.    \" Paul et Virginie \"\n  ( 1786) - - but this trend gradually developed into a\ndevice for demonstrating, by contrast, the deficiencies of European\ncivilization. \n\n\nGermany, on the other hand, possessed no colonial territory\nthroughout the nineteenth century and chose North or South America - -\ncontinents to which Germans had migrated during that century - - as the\ndesirable alternative to whatever was unsatisfactory in the homeland. \n\n\nWhen Germany acquired colonies during the period 1890-1914, German\ncolonial fiction began to take up and defend the imperial cause, but  experience, as a colonial power was not long enough or did not\nstir the  imagination adequately to generate a fictional\ntradition.\n\n\nThe French underwent a much longer and varied experience, in\nAfrica and South-east Asia - - also in tiny conclaves on the Indian\nsub-continent - hence the volume of French literature relating to its\ncolonies is proportionately larger, and theorists like Roland Lebel and\nEugene Pujarniscle have held  that colonial fiction\nhad developed as a distinct genre.\n\n\nHowever, subsequent to the dismantling of colonial systems that\nhas happened in the second half of the twentieth century, the outlook on this\naspect of  French literature has also undergone\ndrastic revision.\n\n\nAlec Hargreaves gives expression to such revision when, in the\nepilogue of his study of French colonial fiction he states: \n\n\nBy their adoption of their former  language the\nworks of contemporary francophone writers in Africa and elsewhere certainly\nbear witness to the impact of alien rule on the cultures of colonised\npeoples.\n\n\nThe colonial experiences seems to have had comparatively little\neffect on the artistic traditions of their conquerors.   \n\n \n\nThis conclusion would be broadly true of the Indo-British\nrelationship, but Anglo-Indian fiction has not always shared concerns of\nFrench or German colonial fiction.\n\n\nAs for Indians who do not write in English, they owe little or\nnothing to Meadows Taylor or Kipling or E. M Forster. \n\n \n\nImaginative literature related to their colonies has been\nproduced by only a few European nations and even for them it occupies a\ntemporary phase in their literary history.\n\n\nBut the nature and timing of these literary works, especially the\nnovels were such that literary historians and critics have from time to time\nsought to place them inside some wider phenomenon.\n\n\nIn an early such attempt, Susanne Howe studied mainly nineteenth\ncentury works of colonial fiction in English, French and German, and found\nthat they generally acted as flag-bearers of the idea of empire:  \"\nThe novelists took the institution of empire itself, along with the\nmultiplicity of people and situations that it so prodigally furnished forth,\ncompletely for granted.\"  \n\n\nBut when she looked at the twentieth century - - and specially at\nsome English novels about India - - she decided that on the whole the authors\ncould be divided into three classes:  \" the Defenders, the Doubters,\nand the Attackers\"  . \n\n\nA much wider variety of responses to the imperial situation was\ndiscerned by Alan Sandison when he chose to examine the work of some  late Victorian novelists and short story writers like Rider\nHaggard, Kipling, Conrad and John Buchan.\n\n\nThey all wrote in English but none was exclusively a writer of\ncolonial fiction.\n\n\nWhen they did write stories with colonial settings, elements other\nthan those relating to imperial ideology was never by itself a source of\ninspiration to these writers:  \" To see it as such would be to accord\nto the imperial idea a creative role in literature which it never\npossessed in history.\"  \n\n\nLater in the book he insists that not even  work\nhad the imperial idea as its basic inspiration.\n\n\nMore than the other authors discussed here Kipling was keenly aware\nof the separation between the rulers and the ruled inevitable in the colonial\nsituation; the separation could also be seen as one between man and nature\nwhen the European intruder could not come to terms with \nclimate.\n\n\nSandison concludes:  \" Awareness of \nestrangement and his compulsive need to armour himself against its\neffects, creates the dramatic tension in Kipling.\"  \n\n\nSteadfast in his admiration of Kipling, Sandison suggests that  success was a matter of his being able to use the idea of\nempire as a means of conveying his own artistic vision. \n\n \n\nBy choosing a different set of writers - - also, writers who are\nmore important than  set as authors - - who wrote of the\ncolonial experience, Jeffrey Meyers is able to construct a sequence that ran\nparallel to the rise and fall of western colonialism: \n\n\nThe colonial genre is virtually invented and introduced into English\nliterature by Kipling in the 1880s, at the apogee of the ` scramble for\nAfrica' is improved upon by Conrad, reaches its peak in  \" A\nPassage to India  , \" and is continued by [ Joyce ] Carey\nand [ Graham ] Greene, who are influenced by Forster and Conrad.   \n\n \n\nWhile we may not agree that the  ` colonial genre'\n was innovated as late as the 1880s, Meyers has suggested a most\nconveniently  inclusive framework.\n\n\nIn planning to run the writing of these novels alongside the history\nof western colonialism, Meyers has had to find the genre declining when the\nBritish Empire began to disintegrate.\n\n\nYet, when he found place in this scheme for Greene, he had\nunwillingly conceded that this genre, like Anglo-Indian fiction proper, was\ncapable of indefinite extension.\n\n\nPractically the same combination of authors except Greene, who is\nreplaced by D. H. Lawrence - - is used by D.C.A.R. Goonetilleke to discuss\nnot colonial fiction but how, between the 1880s and 1939, some developing\ncountries in South and South-east Asia, Central and South America, and Africa\nwere portrayed in British fiction. \n\n\nThis critic is not interested as such in studying imperialism in\naction, but, except for  Mexico in  \" The\nPlumed Serpent \"  ( 1926 ) , all the texts discussed by him\nrelate to imperial milieu and all the authors - - again excepting Lawrence -\n- had first-hand work experience in these developing countries serving the\nimperial system.\n\n\nWhile imperialism may have created the conditions which stimulated\nthe creation of these literary works, Goonetilleke finds the works very\ndifferent from each other and in no way subject to any condition that\ndetermines how western writers of this period wrote about non-western people.\n\n\nAlso, he is careful to note errors of perception committed by these\nwriters; he claims to know better because he is an Asian.\n\n\nAs he remarks tellingly in the chapter on Kipling and Forster,\n \" It did not occur to me that the East could be considered  `\nmysterious'  until I read Western writings about it.\" \n \n\n\n *  This article forms part of the\nopening chapter of a book with the same title that is in press with the\nOrient Longman at Bombay. \n\n\n 1 See Stephen Hemenway,  \" The Novel of India\n\"  , ( 1975 ) , Vol.  1,  chap. 1; also Raji\nNarasimhan,  \" Sensibility under Stress \"  ( 1962 )\n, chap.12. \n\n\n 2 Bhupal Singh,  op.cit  ., p. 1. \n\n\n **\n\n\nThe tradition may be said to have begun with Elizabeth    Translation of the Letters of a Hindoo\nRajah  , a work in two volumes published from London in 1796.\n\n\nThe author was the sister of Charles Hamilton of the East India\nCompany and the book is dedicated to \" Warren Hastings \" .\n\n\nIt tells of the friendship between one  Rajah \nZaarmilla and a young English officer, Captain Percy, who was serving in\nIndia.\n\n\nAfter Percy died Zaarnilla corresponded with \nrelations and friends and eventually went to England.\n\n\nFrom there he wrote regularly to an Indian friend.\n\n\nThese two sets of letters provide the material for the book.\n\n\n\n 3 David Rubin states in the preface to his  \"\nAfter the Raj : \"   \" I was tempted to deal with\nAmerican fiction about India, but by now such writing constitutes a full\nsubject for study in its own right\"  ( p.  11  ) .\n\n\nIt so happens that at a conference on  \" Conflicting Images:\nIndia and the United States\"  held at Harvard in March 1986, I\npresented a paper on American novels about India under the title  \"\nThe Indias of American Fiction.\" \n\n\nSee Appendix. \n\n\n 4 Among writers of Australian origin is Hugh Atkinson,\nauthor of  The Pink and the Brown  ( first pub. 1957 in England;\nrept. 1965 in Australia ) . \n\n\n 5 Among Canadians who wrote fiction set in India, one of\nthe earliest is Sara Jeanett Duncan.\n\n\nHer novels are  \" The Story of Sonny Sahib \"\n ( 1894 ) ,  \"  Aunt \"  (\n1894 ) ,  \" His Honour and a Lady \"  ( 1896 ) ,\n \" Hilda \"  ( 1898 ) ,  \" Set in\nAuthority \"  ( 1906 ) ,  \" The Burnt Offering\n\"  ( 1909 ) .  \n\n\n 6 Hugh Ridley,  \" Images of Imperial Rule\n\"  ( Croom Helm, London,1983 ) , p. 2 \n\n\n 7 Ridley cites   \" \nMailemaisille de Maupin  \"  ( 1836 ) ,    \" Voyage en Orient  \"  (\n1851 ) and Pierre   \"  Le Marriage de\nLote  \"  ( 1874 ) , as exemplars of this trend.\n\n\n\n 8 Ridley, again, names Charles Sealsfield ( 1973 - 1864 )\nand Friedrich Gerstacker ( 1816-72 ) in this context as the two major\nfigures in German writing of this period. \n\n\n 9\n\n\nIn works like   \"  Histoire de\nla litterature coloniale en France  \"  ( 1931 ) , and\n  \"  Philoxene ou de la\nlitterature coloniale  \"  ( 1931 ) .  \n\n\n 10 Alec G hargreaves,  \" The Colonial\nExperience in French Fiction \"  ( Macmillan Press, London,\n1981 ) , p. 159.\n\n\nThis is primarily a study of the works of  Pierre Loti,\nErnest Psichari and Pierre Mille.  \n\n\n 11 Howe.  \" Novels of Empire \" \n( Columbia University Press, New York, 1949 ) p.20. \n\n\n 12  Ibid  , p. 19.\n\n\nThis categorization may have led to Allen \nperiodization consisting of three eras.\n\n\nSee his  \" The British Image of India' \" \nop.cit,  \n\n\n 13 Alan Sandison  \" The Wheel of Empire\n\"  ( Macmillan Press, London, 1967 ) , p. 20. \n\n\n 14  Ibid  ., p. 195. \n\n\n 15 Jeffrey meyers,  \" fiction and the Colonial\nExperience \"  ( Boydell Press, Ipswich, 1973 ) , p.  7\n .  \n\n\n 16 D.C.A.R.

{"text": "BLOOD  SUBSTITUTES    \n\n \n\n\n  JEAN   Baptiste Denis, a French\nphysician was convicted some three hundred years ago in 1667, for\nmurdering a patient.\n\n\nIn fact, Denis had tried to save the life of the patient.\n\n\nHe had injected  blood into the patient in an effort\nto cure him.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the patient died and Denis, the first ever person to\ntransfuse blood, had the stigma of murderer stuck on to him for life.\n\n\nTwo hundred years later, when bloodtransfusion was revived it\nbecame a very common medical procedure.\n\n\nMillions of people donate blood to someone or receive it\neveryday.\n\n\nIn fact thousands of soldiers surviving the second World War owe\ntheir life to this technique.\n\n\nEven the wonders of modern medical science like heart\ntransplantation and other surgeries would have been inconceivable had not\nthis technique of replacing lost blood rapidly been availble.\n\n\nToday, according to a rough estimate, worldwide about 35 million\nunits of blood are transferred every year. \n\n \n\nThe impact of blood tranfusion has been such that donating blood\nto someone came to be considered as a supreme philanthropic gesture.\n\n\nIn India enthusiastic volunteers could be seen organizing\nblood-donating camps where people willingly give away some of their blood.\n\n\nBut, the times do change.\n\n\nThe advent of Mention> AIDS \" into the public health arena\nis changing this scene.\n\n\nPeople are more reluctant now-a-days to denote blood as it became\nknown that blood transfusion procedure is also one of the causes spreading\nthe dreaded disease Mention> AIDS \" .\n\n\nThe patients too are afraid of receiving blood that is not tested and\nconfirmed as not having \" AIDS \" virus.\n\n\nUnfortunately modern world cannot do away with blood-transfusion.\n\n\nWorld over, therefore, scientists - - chemists, physicians,\nbiotechnologists - - are spending sleepless nights to find an alternative\nto it, an alternative that does not bring risks of diseases with it but is as\nefficient in saving life as the natural blood. \n\n \n\nThe uniqueness of blood is that it is a living fluid tissue.\n\n\nIt is also the sole vehicle which supplies necessary nutrients and\noxygen to all tissues in the body.\n\n\nThe most important function of the blood, is removing accumulated\ncarbondioxide from the tissues and replenishing them with oxygen.\n\n\nFor, human cells without exception require a regular supply of\noxygen to keep going.\n\n\nThe cells in the retina of the eye, for example, can not see\nanything if it is deprived of oxygen for even a second.\n\n\nShutting off oxygen supply to the brain for four minutes can kill\nbrain cells leaving the person comatose or paralyzed.\n\n\nThat is why any person who loses a lot of blood, as after an\naccident, can suffer a shock and even die.\n\n\nBut he can be saved by timely replenishment of the lost blood by\ntransfusion.\n\n\nFor some people, sufferers of some genetic disorders such as\nThalassemia, blood transfusion is a must for survival. \n\n \n\n  Blood   transfusion is not a\nsimple transfer of blood from one person to another.\n\n\nBefore any transfusion, the blood of the donor has to be   \nwith that of the recipient.\n\n\nIf the two do not match, the patient may suffer a shock.\n\n\nJean Baptiste Denis could not succeed because he tried to transfuse\n blood which is incompatible with  .\n\n\nSince donors whose blood matches with the recipient may not always be\npresent nearby during an emergency, previously collected blood and stored in\nblood-banks is usually used for transfusion.\n\n\nStoring blood for long without it getting spoiled is a costly affair.\n\n\nBut doctors today are more concerned about the hygienic quality of\nthe blood meant for transfusion than anything else.\n\n\nThere have been cases of Thalassemia patients inadvertently geting\ninfected with AIDS virus after a transfusion with contaminated blood.\n\n\nThere have also been cases of patients of surgery who along with the\nblood also received hepatitis or a veneral disease.\n\n\nThese incidents and the increasing cases of \" AIDS \"\ninfection due to blood transfusion have made scientists to take a second look\nat blood transfusion.\n\n\nCan we have something that acts just like blood, is available in\nplenty, and can be maintained pure?\n\n\nCan we produce blood outside the human body to have pure\nuncontaminated blood, for trnasfusion?\n\n\nThese are some of the questions which the scientists are trying\nto find answer to. \n\n \n\nThe main objective of blood transfusion, in a nutshell, is to\nmaintain sufficient oxygen supply to the body tissues of a patient\ntemporarily, because given enough time his body can produce fresh blood that\ntakes care of oxygen transport.\n\n\nThe constituent which gives blood its distinct scarlet red colour as\nwell as the capability of carrying oxygen is a unique iron containing protein\ncalled haemoglobin.\n\n\nEvery millilitre of blood contains millions of red blood cells which\nare nothing but bags of haemoglobin, which has a special affinity for\noxygen molecules.\n\n\nEach haemoglobin molecule can simultaneously carry four molecules\nof oxygen.\n\n\nAlso it is able to carry carbondioxide ( CO2 ) produced\nduring respiration, from cells in different parts of the body to the lungs\nand exchange CO2 for oxygen.\n\n\nIt then returns to the cells carrying oxygenated haemoglobin to\nsupply oxygen. \n\n \n\nThis important role of haemoglobin has made scientists to think\nof at least two alternatives to whole-blood transfusions.\n\n\nThe first is to use some synthetic chemicals which can act like\n \nhaemoglobin to carry oxygen.\n\n\nThe second is to find a way of making pure haemoglobin in large\nquantities outside the body and use it directly for transfusion. \n\n \n\n  PERFLUROCARPONS   ( PFCs ) , a\ngroup of synthetic chemicals that can mimic the function of haemoglobin have\nbeen tried since 1968 as an alternative to blood transfusion.\n\n\nThese are organic compounds in which all hydrogen molecules have\nbeen replaced with fluorine.\n\n\nThus a host of PFCs have been prepared and tested for their\nsuitability as blood substitutes.\n\n\nThe most important character which makes PFCs a good candidate as\na blood substitute is their ability to dissolve large amounts of gases,\nespecially oxygen and carbondioxide.\n\n\nIn fact, every millilitre of a PFC can dissolve more oxygen than does\nblood or water.\n\n\nUnfortunately, almost all PFCs are solids and do not easily\ndissolve in water.\n\n\nThe solvents in which they dissolve, like petroleum ether, acetone,\nor benzene do not suit the human body.\n\n\nTherefore, the PFCs have been used in the human body in the form of\ncolloid solutions.\n\n\nOne disadvantage of using colloids is their low osmotic pressure\nwhich can be damaging to the body cells when injected.\n\n\nBut this problem has been solved to some extent by mixing the colloid\nwith substances like hydroxyethyl starch to bring the osmotic pressure in\nlevel with that of human blood or other body cells. \n\n \n\nDespite these stumbling blocks the PFCs have been considered\nattractive alternative to blood because they can be easily stored, can be\nkept viable even after years of storage and reconstituted from a solid\nform whenever necessary.\n\n\nMoreover in cases where blood or blood products do not suit the\npatients, PFCs can come to help.\n\n\nFor example, they can be used in patients who have turned allergic to\ntransfusion because of repeated blood transfusions, without any side-effects.\n\n\nThere are other advantages also.\n\n\nFor instance, in cases of carbonmonoxide poisoning which usually\nhappens in a fire-accident, blood  transfusions can\nbe of little help.\n\n\nCarbonmonoxide in the smoke enters the blood and binds to the\nhaemoglobin in such a tight embrace that oxygen is unable to bind to it any\nmore.\n\n\nThe patient, as a result, may faint, become comatose or even die\ninspite of a blood transfusion.\n\n\nBut unlike haemoglobin, PFCs can transport oxygen even in the\npresence of carbondioxide.\n\n\nRats breathing in air half of which is carbondioxide have survived\nlonger when infused with PFCs than those which did not receive them.\n\n\nAnd PFCs are not mere curiosities in the laboratories.\n\n\nA firm in Osaka, Japan has been manufacturing two commercial\nproducts,  Oxypherol  and  Fluosol-DA  as alternatives to\nblood.\n\n\nOxypherol is intended for laboratory use, whereas  Fluoso-DA\n has been effectively used in clinics also.\n\n\n FluosolDA  has been licensed for use in operation\ntheatres where large amounts of blood is required for surgery.\n\n\nIt helps in keeping the  tissues supplied with\noxygen and also saves on scarce human blood which can be used only when it is\ninevitable.\n\n\nResearches have also been on to find a PFC that is more soluble and\nto make most of the already available PFCs.\n\n\nIn the latter case, efforts of a Japanese company in packing these\nhaemoglobin-like compounds in little bags of lipid-membranes has been a\nsuccess.\n\n\nMice completely drained of their natural blood and replaced with such\ncontaining liposomes survived for many days. \n\n \n\nPFCs can be good functional alternatives but are not as\ncolourful as haemoglobin.\n\n\nThe mice had only PFC solution running in their veins and arteries\nlost their colour of the pink eye, nose and toes.\n\n\nTherefore, the second alternative of using the natural protein itself\nin place of blood has engaged the attention of scientists more than PFCs.\n\n\nSince a long time people have tried to extract pure haemoglobin from\nother animals and use it in man.\n\n\nThe matching of blood types which is most essential for transfusion\ncan be done away with if pure haemoglobin is used.\n\n\nFor, the incompatibility between different blood-groups occurs not\nbecause of haemoglobin but because of some antigenic proteins on the surface\nof redblood cells.\n\n\nThus animal haemoglobin can also be used in humans.\n\n\nEven the haemoglobin collected from the human blood has been tried.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the very same protein which when packed in a red blood\ncell is life-giving becomes a poison when out of it.\n\n\nFor, pure haemoglobin when injected into the blood affects a vital\norgan - - the kidney - - and damages it.\n\n\nMoreover, its high affinity for oxygen is lost when present free in\nthe blood.\n\n\nThe haemoglobin molecule outside the red blood cell breaks up easily\nand is excreted fast through kidneys.\n\n\nTherefore attempts are now on to  make cell-free\nhaemoglobin as efficient and stable as the haemoglobin packed in the red\nblood cells. \n\n \n\nA better understanding of the structure of haemoglobin has\nbeen of help in this respect.\n\n\nIn fact, haemoglobin has been the first human protein whose\nstructure, and functions have been worked out to the finest details.\n\n\nNot only that, the genes responsible for its production have been\nidentified, separated and duplicated into many copies too.\n\n\nThe haemoglobin protein is a tetramer-a molecule made up of two\nunits each of two different peptides called   alpha \n and   beta   chains.\n\n\nThe complete sequence of the amino acids that make up the \n alpha   chain and of the chain of 146 amino acids in\nthe   beta   peptide are now part of every\nbiology text book.\n\n\nThe sequences have been worked out to such a fine detail that the\nsickle cell anemia - - a genetic disorder wherein the red blood cells do not\nhave the usual discshape and so carry very less oxygen - - is known to be\ncaused by a change in just one single amino acid in the chain.\n\n\nThe change is due to a mutation, again a change in just one\nnucleotide in the entire sequence of nucleotides on the DNA coding for the\nhaemoglobin peptides.\n\n\nThe haemoglobin structure is dynamic, in the sense that it can\nchange its shape as the oxygen binds to it.\n\n\nThus when one molecule of oxygen binds to haemoglobin, the\nstructure is so modified that three more oxygen molecules can combine with\nit.\n\n\nIt is also associated with another chemical known as 2, 3, - \ndisphosphoglycerate ( 2, 4 DPG ) .\n\n\nWhen free and outside the cell haemoglobin lacks the 2, 3-DPG\nbecause of which the tetramer structure breaks up into two  \nalpha-beta   dimers.\n\n\nThough these dimers can bind to oxygen, they can also be excreted\neasily out through kidneys.\n\n\nThe net effect is a lack of oxygen in the blood.\n\n\nTherefore efforts have been made to modify free haemoglobin\nchemically so that it remains stable as a tetramer, can pick up oxygen easily\nand lingers longer in the body without being thrown out. \n\n \n\nThe tetrameric structure of free haemoglobin can be stabilized\nand even aggregated into large polymers, when because of its sheer size\nkidneys are unable to filter it out.\n\n\nHowever, such modifications also make the haemoglobin containing\nfluid more vis-matched  are produced using\nchemicals like glutar-aldehyde which react with the amino acid groups on the\ntwo different dimers.\n\n\nBut such modified haemoglobin can not be stored for long as the\naldehyde linkage rearrange themselves changing the reactivity of\nhaemoglobin in an unpredictable way.\n\n\nBut chemicals such as dextran and polyethylene glycol when joined\nwith haemoglobin retain its structure longer.   <box>\n\n\n Haemoglobin Structure is dynamic.\n\n\nIt can change its shape as oxygen binds on it.  </box>",

Singh, the President,\nMr. R. Venkataraman has returned the Bill to Parliament for reconsideration.\n\n\n \n\nThis is as it should be.\n\n\nDuring a warlike emergency, a measure for intercepting postal\narticles and mail can be understood as part of censorship measures.\n\n\nBut any such move at other times could certainly be objected to even\non grounds of upholding the right of privacy of the individual. \n\n \n\nMuch closer study of the subject of the freedom of the individual\nand the possible curtailment of it through subtler ways of checks on carriers\nof information, like interception of postal articles, tapping of telephones,\njamming radio communication and cross-beaming of satellite channels, has been\nmade in other countries.\n\n\nThose keen on upholding the freedom of expression and other\nfundamental freedoms have cautioned against ingenious means which the ruling\npowers might contrive in this age of science and technology to interfere with\npersonal freedoms of those opposed to the ruling authorities. \n\n \n\nThe point is that a legislation might look necessary to meet an\nexigency.\n\n\nEven so, a very careful thought must be given to any kind of\nlegislation that is likely to be abused and misused either by the existing\nGovernment or the succeeding regimes.\n\n\nAn alert Government normally has enough powers to prevent mischief\neven without taking recourse to controversial legislative measures. \n\n \n\nIn fact, in our country the Supreme Court has said that a\nrestriction is reasonable only when there is a proper balance between the\nrights of the individual and those of the society.\n\n\nA restriction must not be greater than the mischief to be prevented.\n\n\nAs such, it is only proper that the said Postal Bill should be\nsubjected to a fuller scrutiny of Parliament again. \n\n\n  An experimental side  \n\n \n\n  FOR   the first time, the\nIndian Cricket selectors have shown foresight and boldness in selecting a\nteam which is full of promising youngsters.\n\n\nRaj Singh Dungarpur and his colleagues no doubt would earn praise\nfor pinning faith on youngsters who have done remarkably well in the home\ncompetitions in recent years, though their action in sacking Krishnamachari\nSrikkanth from Captaincy and again from the team may not be to the liking of\ncricket lovers. \n\n \n\nPerhaps the selectors were deeply impressed by the success of the\nyoung members of the team that recently toured Pakistan to draw the four\nmatch Test series.\n\n\nThe selectors have not only brought a young man to lead the team for\nthe seven-week New Zealand tour but have infused fresh blood with an eye on\nthe future of Indian cricket.\n\n\nAs Raj Singh has himself said, the team has been chosen for the\nnineties.\n\n\nThe youngsters under Azharuddin must take this opportunity and\nestablish their worth in the team. \n\n \n\nIt is going to be a challenging tour.\n\n\nFor the first time in Indian cricket, we have a cricket Manager in\nBishen Singh Bedi, who should be able to help the youngsters.\n\n\nPerhaps, the selectors realised that New  status in\ninternational cricket today is not that strong or formidable and decided\nto send an experimental side.\n\n\nThe selectors need to be complimented for this excellent move, for\nour senior stars like Ravi Shastri, Srikkanth and others had failed miserably\non the West Indies and Pakistan tours. \n\n \n\nHowever, we still feel, a place could have been found for Dilip\nVengasarkar, who has done well in home competitions after withdrawing from\nthe Pakistan tour.\n\n\n rather strange argument that his decision to\nwithdraw from the Pakistan tour has gone against Vengasarkar, does not\nsound convincing.\n\n\nAre we to understand that no player should opt out of a tour? \n\n \n\nThis is the first time that such a young side is chosen for a\nforeign tour and it would be unfair to cast aspersions on their abilities as\ninternational cricketers.\n\n\nPlayers like Sanjay Manjrekar, Sachin Tendulkar and Navjot Sidhu have\nproved themselves and there is no reason as to why one should not expect the\nnew members of the team to come out with flying colours.  \n\n\n\n\n  New Governors  \n\n \n\n THE sweeping changes made\nin the occupants of the  Raj Bhavans  in the country is an\nindication of the belief of the National Front Government in the US-like\nsystem of sharing the spoils.\n\n\nThe earlier approach was to look to the Governors for continuity of\nadministration at the level of overall supervision.\n\n\nNo exception could be taken to that approach but the fact that cannot\nbe denied is that during the recent years a situation was brought about to\nmake the Governors merely dummies of the powers that be at the Centre.\n\n\nIn fact, even a President had to deny that he was a  \" rubber\nstamp\"  ! \n\n \n\nIt is also true that while some of the Governors conducted\nthemselves with such high dignity, that they were an automatic choice for\nappointment as ambassadors to key nations of the world, others betrayed a\nmarked lack of maturity and invited criticism from all quarters.\n\n\nAndhra Pradesh, in particular, had a bitter taste of the latter kind.\n\n\nIn a way, therefore, the National Front Government cannot be blamed\nmuch for making fresh appointments in almost all the States. \n\n \n\nEven so, what the Union Government has now done might create the\nimpression that only a few Governors really did justice to the responsibility\nentrusted to them, for they have been retained in the same States or\ntransferred to some others.\n\n\nThe rest have been replaced.\n\n\nThe latter might appear to have been viewed with disfavour, of\ncourse, with the exception of some who were about to retire in the normal\ncourse. \n\n \n\nHowever, unlike the earlier appointments, when Governors were\nchosen either to get rid of some unwanted persons from the Union Cabinet or\nfrom the higher echelons of the ruling party, the new appointments speak\nfor a choice made on the basis of experience, maturity and administrative\nability in most of the cases.\n\n\nIt should be noted that Mr. P.C. Alexander has been retained as the\nGovernor of Tamil Nadu and Prof. Nurul Hassan has been shifted back to West\nBengal. \n\n \n\nMaharashtra, in particular, is fortunate to have Mr. C.\nSubramaniam as its new Governor.\n\n\nHe is without doubt one of the elder statesmen in the country and an\nadministrator of proven ability.\n\n\nThe State administration will have the benefit of his experience in\ntackling its proplems in the fast changing times. \n\n\n  The fight within  \n\n \n\n  AS   the D-Day for filling\nnominations to the State Assembly elections is approaching, there seems to be\ngrowing dissidence among the Congress-I rank and file.\n\n\nThere is little doubt that the Assembly elections this time are going\nto be a crucial affair and the Congress-I would be facing the toughest of\ntimes.\n\n\nThe Shiv Sena-BJP combine is facing the party squarely in the face\nand this is going to be a big challenge to the party.\n\n\nAt such a juncture, it was expected that the ruling party would\nclose its rank and face the challenge unitedly.\n\n\nApparently, the unity move within the party itself is facing a\nchallenge. \n\n \n\nThe formation of the new  \" Maharashtra Samantar (\nparallel) Congress\"  by Mr. Raibhan Jadhav, a senior party\nfunctionary and a director of sugar factory from Aurangabad goes to prove it\nfurther.\n\n\nMr. Jadhav has claimed that 47 present and former MLAs from\nMaharashtra have backed this new party and if Mr. Jadhav is to be\nbelieved, the new party would field more than 100 candidates against the\nofficial nominees of the party in the ensuring State Assembly elections.\n\n\nIt is doubtful if the new party would pose any serious threat to the\nofficial nominees of the party but it certainly goes to prove that everything\nis not well within the party at the crucial moment of Assembly election. \n\n \n\nThe recent Mayoral elections at Nagpur also saw open rebellion in\nthe party.\n\n\nThe election of a rebel candidate has made matters worse in the\n standing in the city, which has so far stood solidly by the\nCongress-I.\n\n\nThe official list of the Congress-I nominees would be out by the time\nthese lines appear but it is almost certain that all sections of the partymen\nwould not be satisfied with the final list and there would be much heart\nburning in the rank and file of the party. \n\n \n\nThe happenings within the past week do not augur well for the\nparty but since the Chief Minister, Mr. Pawar, has been reported to have\nwalked away with a major chunk of tickets for his own supporters it should be\nhis endeavour to win over the dissidents and re-group the warring factions to\nface the Assembly polls.\n\n\nHe must see the writing on the wall.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5acd858b-6bfb-49f5-a085-a7be76650c08", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.215672+00:00"}
{"text": "The Aesthetics of Black Protest Theatre   \n\n\n K. Santhanam  \n\n\n Jamal Mohamed College, Tiruchirapalli \n\n \n\nCONTEMPORARY black drama has emerged not only as a source of\nentertainment but also as an expression of culture and a medium of\ninstruction.\n\n\nThe new black dramatists in America have artistically depicted the\nidentity crisis faced by the black Americans in their plays.\n\n\nToday there is a widespread recognition by black American dramatists\nthat theatre can have enormous impact on the black  struggle to\nattain full equality and status in America and thereby regain his spiritual\nstrength.\n\n\nSo the performing arts have emerged as important means of reaching\nwider audiences and getting greater recognition.\n\n\nA number of dramatists have made very significant contribution,\ntowards the growth of black theatre in America and the success of their\neffort is seen in the establishment of Black Protest Theatre there. \n\n \n\nThe black protest theatre movement in America arises out of a\ncertain social and political philosophy of life.\n\n\nBlack dramatists like Baraka and Bullins firmly believe that \n\" there are in fact and in spirit two Americas - - one black, one white\"\n   \n\n\nThese dramatists have lost faith in the concept of  ` American\nDream'  and the integrationist principles advocated by the middle\nclass American blacks.\n\n\nConsequently these playwrights reject the Western dramatic theories\nwith their emphasis on social realism and the universality of human\nexperiences which have no validity in the context of black situation\nprevailing in America.\n\n\nThese dramatists are of the view that long years of  suffering and oppression of the blacks have necessitated the adoption\nof a new dramatic model that will address the black brethren directly leading\nto the expression of their unique black experience in America.\n\n\nQuite naturally, besides advocating racial and cultural\nseparation, these plays are addressed to the black people who have a social\nand cultural tradition different from the mainstream American Society and\nwhose experiences run counter to the Western modes. \n\n \n\nBaraka in his essay  ` The Revolutionary Theatre' \n, has laid down the aims and objectives of this new kind of theatre which has\nushered in a new theatrical renaissance in America.\n\n\nHe says that this new theatre will bring in a new vision of black\nreality by its open advocacy of violence and revolution which will lead to\nthe destruction of white America.\n\n\nThis theatre will present  \" the black as a victim living in a\nno- land completely invisible to white America.\"  \n \n\n\nBy presenting this theatre as a theatre of victims, it excites the\nblack spectators to anger and violence which moves them into liberation of\nblacks from a sense of suffering and oppression in white America.\n\n\nThis theatre, by its advocacy of violence, murder and revolution\nseeks to put an end to the suffering of blacks in America.\n\n\nThe violence it preaches is redemptive of a regenerative kind of\nviolence that envisages the establishment of a new world order based on\nrevolution.\n\n\nBaraka, in his early plays presents his heroes as victims since they\nrefuse to act very firmly in time which makes them a prey to white power\nstructure.\n\n\nBut his later dramatic heroes emerge triumphant physically and\nspiritually having acquired the revolutionary black consciousness.\n\n\nThe process of  ` razing'  gives rise to  `\nraising'  a new black world.\n\n\n \" The Revolutionary Theatre must expose.\n\n\nIt must Accuse and attack anything that can be accused or attacked.\n\n\nIt must Accuse and Attack because it is a theatre of victims.\"\n    \n\n \n\nThe black dramatists like Baraka and Bullins are of the view that\ntheir picture of black coloured realism depicting the sufferings of the\nblacks is much different from the Euro-American concept of realism as\nportrayed by the mainstream writers who  take no\ncognisance of the black situation prevailing in America.\n\n\nThis revolutionary black realism not only aims at destruction of\nsocial and cultural white America but also builds a new black world by\nincorporating the Afro-American cultural values.\n\n\nThe black revolutionary writers like Baraka during the course of\ntheir dramatic career are very much influenced by the theories of black\nAesthetics and Black Art, The advocates of this theory say that Black is\nbeautiful and produce literary works depicting black life with its\ndistinctive styles and rhythms of black people.\n\n\nThey try to go back to their black heritage and strength which have\nenabled them to endure prolonged oppression.\n\n\nSome black revolutionary writers like Baraka want the black writer to\ncreate black art by separating himself completely from the American\nmainstream and give expression to black experience.\n\n\nThe black Art which will directly address the black people will give\nthem a new sense of direction, a new mythology and symbolism which would help\nin the shaping of the black artistic and cultural forms.\n\n\nAny work of art if it does not adequately reflect the black\nexperience, does not confirm to the theories of Black Aesthetics.\n\n\nThe pragmatic value of a work of art, its effective quality is more\nimportant than its expressive qualities.\n\n\nAccording to the principles of black Aesthetic, the transmission of a\nmessage from a teaching black author to willing black audience becomes the\n   touchstone   of literary achievement.\n\n\nAccording to the revolutionary protest writers, black drama or any\nwork of art arising from the oppression and sufferings of the black people\nshould change the structure of the American society and end the oppression of\nthe blacks.\n\n\nBesides this, black community and thereby usher in a cultural\nrevolution. \n\n \n\nThe black critics have come out with certain new artistic\ncriteria in evaluating these black productions.\n\n\nThese critics want these black productions to be judged not on the\nbasis of western dramatic theories and practice, but on their own black\ncultural    echoes   and tradition.\n\n\nSince these plays are written out of the suffering and oppression of\nblacks, they have to be judged based on Afro-American cultural tradition and\nyardstick.\n\n\nWhile evaluating a black performance, the critic has to take into his\nconsideration the subject matter of the play and its impact on the audience\nsince the black dramatists interested  in educating\nthe black community and thereby raise its consciousness.\n\n\nUnder such conditions a black play is not just a work of art but\nbecomes an effective tool in raising the black awareness of the entire race.\n\n\nTherefore it would be better if the critic evaluates these plays with\na knowledge of Afro-American Culture and history.\n\n\nBy way of illustration, we can cite the example of Kathakali theatre\nin Kerala.\n\n\nA performance of Kathakali dance would make a better impact on an\nindigenous audience with the significance of gesture, sounds, words and their\nconnotations.\n\n\nWhile the Indian audience can share the reaction to the play it is\nlost on a non-Indian audience.\n\n\nAddison Gayle provides a proper evaluation of black production. \n\n\n\n \" A critical methodology has no relevance in the black\ncommunity unless it aids men in becoming better than they are.\n\n\nSuch an element has been solely lacking in the critical cannons\nhanded down from the academics by the Aristotlean critics, the Practical\ncritics, the Formalistic critics, and the New critics.\n\n\nEach has this in common : it aims to evaluate the work of art in\nterms of its beauty, and not in terms of the transformation from ugliness to\nbeauty, that the work of art demands from its audience.\n\n\nThe question for the black critic today is not how beautiful is a\nmelody, a play, a poem, or a novel, but how much more beautiful has the poem\nmelody, play or novel made the life of a single black man.\" \n   \n\n \n\nThis Black Protest Theatre makes no distinction between actors\nand audience or stage and the street or the plays illusion and  reality.\n\n\nSuch distinctions which form part of the Western theatre do not hold\ngood in revolutionary black theatre.\n\n\nOne another important characteristic of Black Protest Theatre that is\ndistinct from the mainstream theatre is its ritualistic aspect.\n\n\nThe ritualistic elements refer to the presence of symbols,\ncharacterisation, themes, and language styles which are frequently repeated\nin all the plays.\n\n\nThis brings to the    audience  \ncertain identifiable patterns which affirm the values of the black community\nfor whom these plays are written. \n\n\nBaraka employs all these devices to produce a ritualistic effect in\nhis Revolutionary Theatre.\n\n\nAt the apparent level  \" Great Goodness of Life\n\"  is an allegory.\n\n\nIt is the story of a weak man who kills his son rather than resist\nthe pressures of an oppressive white power.\n\n\nThe deeper meaning of the play is that a middle class black is unable\nto protect the life of his son because of fear of the whites.\n\n\nHe prefers the killing of his son to resisting the white power. \n\n \n\nBaraka has employed symbols in his revolutionary dramas which\nbring out the meaning of the play in very clear terms.\n\n\nThe white woman in his plays represents evil who taunts the black\nmale with her perverse sexuality.\n\n\nLula in  \" Dutchman \"  represents the\nwhite female temptress and she is the symbol of the white middle class\nAmerica who tempts Clay into violent action. \n\n \n\nBaraka by the use of his language has ritualised his plays.\n\n\nHe has accepted a particular style of language with regard to white\nand black characters.\n\n\nThe black hero is a  ` hip'  whose language reveals\nhis heightened black awareness.\n\n\nHis language emanates from the street world of pimps and prostitutes.\n\n\nThe  ` square'  is a despised character who employs a\ndifferent language register, who is considered to be dangerous to the black\nworld. \n\n \n\nIn the later black revolutionary plays, Baraka incorporates the\nritual form with black symbols and images to give expression to his\nrevolutionary consciousness.\n\n\nA  \" Black Mass \"  is a typical black play\nwhich utilises Afro-American mythic structure incorporating the music of\nSun Ra and the ideology of the Nation of Islam.\n\n\nBaraka, in his effort to bring out his revolutionary black\nconsciousness repeats these devices from play to play so that these patterns\nare easily recognised by the black audience. \n\n \n\nThe idea of an autonomous dramatic form conceived in the Western\ntradition gives place to a theatre that demands audience involvement and\nparticipation to achieve its aims and objectives.\n\n\nThis process is described  \" as a movement from mimesis,\nrepresentation of an action, to methexis, communal helping out of action.\"\n   \n\n\nThrough this process, the black  audience is\ntransformed from spectators of drama to participators of ritual with no\ndistinction between actor and spectator. \n\n \n\nAnother important feature of Black Protest theatre by which it\ndistinguishes itself from the mainstream theatre is in its use of music and\ndance.\n\n\nThe black dramatists, by incorporating the elements of black music\nand dance, in their plays, give expression to their unique black experience.\n\n\nThis theatre, by stressing the close relationship that exists between\nblack artist and the black spectator, gives way to improvisational action\nleading to emotional participation.\n\n\nUnder such theatrical condition, the traditional distinction\nbetween the spectator and the actor is blurred when they become one. \n\n \n\nThis black theatre bears a close resemblance to Antonin  Theatre of Cruelty.\n\n\nAccording to Artaud human beings are governed by certain\nincomprehensible malignant cosmic powers.\n\n\nThe universe with its violent irrational forces is cruel.\n\n\nThe theatre should reveal the essence of human nature by  ` a\ndrama of cruelty'  .\n\n\nSuch scenes must be presented to purge the audience of the\ncorresponding emotions in them.\n\n\nSo, a  ` true theatre'  disturbs repose, frees the\nrepressed unconscious, incites a kind of revolt and exteriorises latent\ncruelty, certainly most of  plays disturb repose and uncover\nsource of conflict.\n\n\nOn one occasion the performance of  \" Dutchman \"\n was cancelled on the ground that it would incite the feelings of black\naudience shortly after the assassination of Martin Luther King. \n\n \n\nWe can also compare the dramatic theories of this black theatre\nwith those of the epic theatre advocated by Bertolt Brecht.\n\n\nAccording to Brecht the highest form of theatre induces the audience\nto act and also demands decisions from them.\n\n\nBrecht also emphasises the apartnesses of the theatrical activity\nwherein the spectator is transformed into an observer.\n\n\nHe is of the view that too much emotional involvement of the audience\nwith the performance has dried them of the creative energies needed to bring\nabout the desired changes in the world.\n\n\nBrecht says that the spectators should leave the theatre with tools\nof heightened scientific perception.\n\n\nHowever, black revolutionary dramatists are different in that they\naim at complete emotional involvement on the part of the audience with the\nactors, a fact proved by his agit - - prop plays which carry  the message to the black community in a simple but effective\nway. \n\n \n\nThe Western drama since Aristotle by following the\nconventional dramatic devices has always attempted to uphold the existing\nsocial and cultural values of the society.\n\n\nBut Black Protest Theatre not only questions the traditional validity\nof the social and cultural values of the Western Society but also rejects\nthem completely with the purpose of inculcating new values.\n\n\nConsequently this Black Protest Theatre makes the audience realise\nthe sad aspect of their lives and forces them into continuing group action.\n\n\n \n\nThe Black Protest Theatre goes beyond pointing out injustices\nmeted out to the black community or making meek appeals to the white society\nto put an end to its oppression of the Blacks.\n\n\nThis theatre that aims at liberating the entire black race, becomes a\ntheatre of communal deliverance, which aims at freeing the black race from\nthe shackles of the white power structure and build a new black world founded\non justice, dignity and pride.  \n\n\n 1 Quoted in Michael Kaufman  \" The Delicate World\nof Reprobation\"  : A note on the  \" Black Revolutionary\nTheatre\"  in  \" The Theatre of Black

KAMAT {#}\n\n\n DETECTING CANCER PAINLESSLY  \n\n\n Due to its simplicity, and rapid diagnosis with minimal\ndiscomfort to patients, Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy ( FNAB) is becoming\nincreasingly popular among both physicians and patients \n\n \n\nA WOMAN came to the Cytology centre for the diagnosis of a lump in\nthe breast.\n\n\nTotally distraught, she tearfully related her case history.\n\n\nJust two months back, she had become a proud mama, having delivered a\nhealthy little baby girl.\n\n\nThe days following the delivery, were the happiest in her life.\n\n\nTill one day, when while lactating her baby, she felt a lump in her\nbreast.\n\n\nAt first she ignored it.\n\n\nBut days and then weeks passed.\n\n\nThe lump persisted.\n\n\nEach time she palpated her breast, she could feel it lying there,\ndeep within.\n\n\nShe feared the worst, could it be cancer?\n\n\nWhat if she could die?\n\n\nWhat would happen to her precious baby? \n\n \n\nThe woman became a total wreck, mentally and physically.\n\n\nHer family worried about her condition, and coerced her to see a\nspecialist.\n\n\nHis examination confirmed her fears.\n\n\nThere was a lump in her breast.\n\n\nThe specialist advised her to get an aspiration biopsy of the lump to\nbe done at the earliest.\n\n\nA Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy ( FNAB) would establish clearly the\ncondition of the lesion, he said.\n\n\nThe woman as directed, came for the FNAB. \n\n \n\nThe FNAB technique, in brief, involves puncturing of the lump,\nwith a fine needle attached to a syringe, and aspirating a few drops of the\nfluid with cells from the suspected part, to be spread on the slide, stained\nand studied under the microscope for establishing a definite pathological\ndiagnosis. \n\n \n\nWhen the biopsy was performed, instead of a few drops, a large\namount of milkish fluid was aspirated and in a fraction of a minute the lump\ndisappeared.\n\n\nThe patient, overcome with relief, burst into tears.\n\n\nThe lump was formed due to retention of milk in the breast and not\ncancer.\n\n\nShe was unable to believe her good luck.\n\n\nA touch of the needle and all her fears, her agonies had evaporated\ninto the thin air.\n\n\n the power of the Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (\nFNAB). \n\n \n\nCancer of the breast is the second most frequent malignancy\namongst Indian females, the first being cancer of the osterine cervix.\n\n\nHowever, a world wide survey puts breast cancer as ranking first\namong cases of cancer in women, especially in the USA and the other western\ncountries.\n\n\nIn the USA, 27 per cent of women suffer from it and one out of every\n11 women is expected to fall prey to this disease in her lifetime.\n\n\nFortunately, the incidence of breast cancer in Asian countries,\nincluding India is relatively low; though evidence points to a definite\nincrease of the cases in the past few years.\n\n\nThe cases of breast cancer diagnosed by the FNAB for the last eight\nto nine years is indicative of this fact.\n\n\nNo doubt, one of the reasons for this increase is an awareness of the\ndisease amongst women.\n\n\nA woman who finds any such abnormality in her breast now rushes to\nthe hospital or to a private specialist for an early diagnosis. \n\n \n\nEven after accounting for this, there is a sizeable rise in the\nnumber of breast lesions.\n\n\nAspiration biopsy done on 600 such patients in the last seven years\nin the Goa medical college revealed a total number of 160 cancerous cases.\n\n\nThese figures do not support the general study of Goan females as\nthey cover only a part of the population.\n\n\nEven so, there is cause for worry.\n\n\nAnother worrisome feature is an increase in the number of breast\ntumors amongst women below 40, and especially among girls aged between 10 to\n15 years.\n\n\nRecently, there was a case of a girl of 10 years with a benign tumor\nand also of a woman of 24 years with an advanced stage of breast cancer. \n\n \n\nIt is commonly known that breast cancer occurs usually in women\nin their late forties and fifties.\n\n\nIt is also common in women who had children at a later age or who\nhave no children at all.\n\n\nIt is widely prevalent amongst obese women and those mothers who do\nnot breast feed their babies.\n\n\nHowever, these concepts are changing fast.\n\n\nThe high incidence of breast cancer amongst young women as observed\nin the last few years, is a pointer to this fact, despite the fact that a\nmajority of Goan girls marry and beget children at a young age and a major\nportion of them usually breast feed their babies.\n\n\nIn the USA, incidence of cancers in young people is attributed to the\naverage American diet, which is rich in fats, oily foods, eggs, meat and\ntinned foods with chemical preservatives.\n\n\nVegetables and fibre foods are poorly represented in their diets.\n\n\nThe major offenders in this respect are the popular fast foods\njoints, regularly patronised by the younger set.\n\n\nToday, however the American public is heeding the warning of\ndieticians, this should serve as a grim warning to our youngsters who blindly\nape the west in their food habits. \n\n \n\nAnother important factor to be considered with respect to this\ndreaded disease is the role played by heredity.\n\n\nCancer of the breast shows a double fold incidence amongst sisters\nand daughters of cancer patients. \n\n \n\nThe early diagnosis of cancer is undoubtedly very important.\n\n\nA proper examination of the affected portion is a must.\n\n\nBreast cancer can be detected at two stages.\n\n\nFirst, before it is clinically palpable.\n\n\nSecond, after it reveals itself as a lump.\n\n\nIn the first stage, the cancer is so tiny that it may only be\ndetected during routine check up by a mammography.\n\n\nIt is advisable for women between 30 and 40 and also those above 50\nyears ( peak ages) to have a routine mammography done every year.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this facility is limited to only a few major hospitals\nin the country and therefore not available to a large section of the\npopulation.\n\n\nIn the second stage, that is when the cancer is big enough to be\npalpated, there are different ways to detect it.\n\n\nUsually, the first person to sense its presence is the patient\nherself.\n\n\nIt is therefore recommended to all females between 30 and 40 years\nand after 50 years to perform a monthly self-examination of the breast.\n\n\nThe next step is a physical examination by a specialist. \n\n \n\nWhen the lump is detected in the breast, one should not panic.\n\n\nMost of the time, the lump is no more than a benign tumor.\n\n\nOn the other hand, this is no excuse for negligence.\n\n\nThe immediate step should be its pathological examination by a biopsy\nfor final diagnosis and treatment. \n\n \n\nTill a few years back, the only method for the pathological\ndiagnosis of the lump in the breast or any other organ was an operation\nbiopsy where a few portions of the affected tissues were taken surgically for\na histopathological diagnosis.\n\n\nFor this, the patient had to be hospitalised and the operation was\ncarried out in most cases under general anaesthesia.\n\n\nThus the patient had to undergo twice the ordeal of an operation, one\nfor the diagnosis, the other for the subsequent treatment. \n\n \n\nThe FNAB technique is a relatively new tool in the armoury of\nearly diagnosis of cancer.\n\n\nIt is today widely used for the diagnosis of not only breast cancers,\nbut also that of other organs like thyroid lymph-node and many others. \n\n \n\nWith the introduction of the FNAB, the whole biopsy process is\nsimplified.\n\n\nIt is painless, and patients accept it without facing any discomfort.\n\n\nIt is performed in the consulting room itself, thus eliminating the\nneed of an operation.\n\n\nIt requires no use of any type of local anaesthesia.\n\n\nAnother very important advantage is that it gives immediate relief to\nthe patients, ( in the case of cysts pouches filled with fluid and not\ncancer.)\n\n\nThe advantage of choosing this method of examination is that the\nreport of the findings is ready within a few hours, much earlier than\noperation biopsies, allowing the surgeon in the case of cancer, to plan the\nline of treatment well in advance.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the biopsies performed by puncturing the lump\nwith a fine needle attached to the syringe render the technique as simple as\nan ordinary intramuscular injection.\n\n\nAspirating a few drops of the fluid on a slide and study of its\ncellular contents under the microscope is the next part of the test.\n\n\nThe entire procedure hardly takes time.\n\n\nThe patient experiences no discomfort and can leave the consulting\nroom immediately. \n\n \n\nAnother advantage of obtaining an early report is that, in cases\nof cancer, it prepares the patient well in advance of her condition and thus\nof undergoing a radical operation. \n\n \n\nDue to its simplicity, rapid diagnosis, and minimal discomfort to\nthe patient, the FNAB technique is being increasingly popular amongst both\nphysicians and patients. \n\n \n\nThis method was introduced in the Goa Medical College in 1979-\n with a modest start of 170 aspirations in the year 1980.\n\n\nIt reached a sizeable figure of 450   \naspirations   in the first half of 1988. \n\n \n\nThe simplicity of the technique is also enhanced by the fact that\nit requires no heavy equipment and thus serves as an ideal method of\ndiagnosis by surgeons in rural areas. \n\n \n\nToday FNAB is providing an increasingly popular method of early\ndiagnosis of breast cancer and by this, assisting both the doctor and the\npatient to explore fresh avenues to cope with this dreaded disease.\n\n\nThe FNAB is here to stay!  \n\n\n\n\n Sanjeev does the star-turn for Rlys    \n\n \n\nTHE star-studded

A good rule for zooming is to focus for the long and shoot\nshort.\n\n\nSetting the longest focal helps in  ` focussing accuracy'\n since one gets the biggest possible image and the minimum depth of\nfield.\n\n\nAnother advantage is metering the backlighted subjects.\n\n\nThe fighter angle of the longest zooming works like a selective\nfocussing and spot reading the exposure.\n\n\nAfter long set focussing and light metering, set the memory lock\nin automatic cameras to that exposure setting and then zoom to the frame\narea wanted and shoot. \n\n \n\n2. From the same position explore all the possible ranges in\n zooming, from the shortest to the\nlongest.\n\n\nEach position will give different pictorial effect.\n\n\nJust try and physically  ` see'  in each situation.\n\n\nSurprisingly new possibilities in viewing will be discovered. \n\n \n\n3. In the single control lens one can push-pull to change the\nlocal length and so the image size.\n\n\nBut one must be careful in not disturbing the focus in this\noperation.\n\n\nAlso in some zoom lenses the outer tube is not tight enough and\nslowly slips from the position, especially when the camera is mounted\nslightly inclined on a tripod.\n\n\nA rubber band helps to check this. \n\n \n\n4. For hand held shooting, to avoid camera shake, the maxim is\n   to have the focal length in use as\nthe minimum shutter speed and adjust the aperture suitably for the exposure\nrequired.\n\n\nIn the zoom lens one remembers only the shorter focal length and\nuses lower shutter speeds.\n\n\nEven though one may be using it must of the time switching over to\nhigher shutter speeds for higher focal lengths is forgotten. \n\n \n\n5. It is better to avoid using filters on zoom lenses as far as\npossible. \n\n \n\n6. Regarding use of lens hoods over zooms bear this in mind-in\nlong focus an improper hood is likely to vignette and it will be visible in\nthe film though not in the screen.\n\n\nDue to the f stop set  the\nhood may also come under focus while clicking.\n\n\nZoom hood should be short enough for shorter focal length, but these\nare not effective for long focal length.\n\n\nSo the hood must be such that it can also be push-pulled along with\nthe zooming of the lens, otherwise the problem of vignetting creeps in. \n\n \n\n7. While holding the camera, use the smaller ratio ( of object -\nimage size) of 1:3 or 1:4 for macro zooming this is easier.\n\n\nFirst set the reproduction ratio on the lens and then focus by moving\nthe whole camera and lens as a total unit and then fine focus. \n\n \n\n8. There are two ways of  ` Macro Zooming'  .\n\n\nUse the special  ` Macro'  setting at short focal\nlength and shoot.\n\n\nThis will permit only a short distance from the object too short for\neffective lighting on it.\n\n\nThere is no  ` zooming'  as such in this mode.\n\n\nPerhaps there may be some special effects.  \n\n \n\nBut if a close up supplementary lens is mounted on the zoom lens,\na different way of  ` macro'  ing can be done.\n\n\nHere the zoom control also can be manipulated and in fact a higher\nmacro ratio is got. \n\n \n\nThe intervening space between the lens and the object is also\ngreater to give better lighting for the subject. \n\n \n\n9. With converters the speed of the zoom lens becomes slower and\nthe aperture marked on the barrel is no longer valid.\n\n\nTo find the new EL and f stop for any converter, multiply both the\nvalues by the power of the converter.\n\n\nFor instance, a 2X converter on 80mm zoom with f / 2 becomes 160mm at\nf / 4.\n\n\nWith TTL metering the extra exposure is generally compensated and\nthere is no need to reset for the meter reading.\n\n\nBut when a non-TTL flash is used the f stop marked on the lens has to\nbe recalculatred to avoid under exposure:\n\n\nAlso, converters generally begin to give better results at 1 stop\nbelow the minimum.\n\n\nThus, a 2X converter on 135 mm / 1.4 lens makes it as 270 mm / 2.8\nlens.\n\n\nIn this good quality, pictures can be had from f / 4 or beyond.\n\n\nBetter per formance is claimed for  \" matched\" \nteleconverters offered by some camera and lens manufacturers.\n\n\nThey are said to be specially corrected particularly well with\ncertain lenses as specified by each maker.  \n\n \n\n  There are two types of zoom lenses, helical and\nrectilinear.\n\n\nIn the former one has to focus by one ring and change the focal\nlength ( zoom ) with another ring   .  \n\n \n\n  A good rule of zooming is to focus for the long and\nshoot short.\n\n\nSetting the longest focal helps in the focussing accuracy since one\ngets the biggest possible image and the minimum depth of field.\n\n\nAnother advantage is metering the back lighted sujects   .\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Pastime \n\n\n  Three Dimension Cards & Flickers  \n\n \n\nEvery one is now-a-days familiar with the colourful foot rulers,\nin which the pictures change as one turns the foot rule.\n\n\nSome such flickers even show movements like movie cartoons.\n\n\nSome cards contain pictures which appears 3-D i.e. having length,\nbreadth and thickness.\n\n\nThe  \" Winking lady\"  , which was recently very\npopular can be cited as its example. \n\n \n\nHere is an attempt to explain how one can make such flickers and\n3-D cards photographically, in  own darkroom.\n\n\nThough the plastic screen, with vertical lines etched on it\ntechnically called a  \" lenticular screen\"  is not easily\navailable in India, however such cards can be made with ordinary line screens\nprinted on lith film. \n\n\n  FLICKERS:  \n\n \n\nFlickers in its crude forms are available as play things for\nchildren.\n\n\nIn these pictures an animal is seen as if in a cage with parallel\nthick bars.\n\n\nAs soon as the bars are slid, a second animal appears in its place.\n\n\nPhotographically these pictures can be made as follows: \n\n \n\nDraw rectangle 3\" X 4\" on a thick ( Black drawing paper ) paper\n4\" x 5\" in size.\n\n\nOn this draw vertical lines lengthwise at say 0.1 inch distance.\n\n\nThere will be 41 such lines.\n\n\nCut all these vertical lines carefully with a blade.\n\n\nThus there will be forty ( 40) bars in the rectangle touching\neach other.\n\n\nCut each alternate bar, and make a cage.\n\n\nWhat we may say makes the front of the cage. \n\n \n\nNow choose two negatives that are going to form the pictures\nthat replace each other.\n\n\nThese picutures are than printed on one and the same paper.\n\n\nFirst the screen with bars ( cage ) is placed on the enlarging\npaper while exposing picture  \" A\"  .\n\n\nThis picture will only be exposed to the gaps int he bars.\n\n\nNow shift the screen carefully through one bar and expose the second\nnegative ( B).\n\n\nAfter developing and fixing and drying the two pictures will be seen\nin alternate vertical strips ( 1/10 inch long and 4 inch high ) , making all\na mess. \n\n \n\nIf the screen is now placed on this messy picture, the parts (\ncage ) of one picture say  \" A\"  will be covered and\npicture  \" B\"  will be seen as a whole picture by illusion.\n\n\nOn moving the screen through one bar picture  \" B\" \nwill be covered and picture  \" A\"  will be seen. \n\n \n\nTwo pictures are printed side by side, by this very method.\n\n\nBut this time the screen is not with 10 lines per inch but with 40\nto 60 lines per inch. \n\n \n\nIt is not possible to cut such a fine stencil on a paper.\n\n\nHence a screen is taken when 60 verticle lines are printed per inch.\n\n\nThe width of the black line must be equal to the width of the\ntransparent line.\n\n\nSuch a screen is called a Roster. \n\n \n\nTwo pictures are now printed on one and the same paper as above.\n\n\nExpose picture  \" A\"  through the Roster.\n\n\nThe paper is exposed only through the transparent parts of Roster.\n\n\nShift the screen through one line only, so that the black lines\ncover the exposed parts and transparent parts are on the unexposed paper.\n\n\nExpose picture  \" B\"  and develop the paper - both\nthe pictures are now printed in alternate vertical lines.\n\n\nOne may not be able to see any picture clearly.\n\n\nThey are jumbled up.\n\n\nIt is difficult to move the roster through exactly one line on the\nexposed paper.\n\n\nWays are therefore to be found to achieve this without mistake.\n\n\nHere is one way: \n\n \n\nTake two rosters and fix them on the base board with cellotape\non two sides of the sensitive paper ( try on dummy paper) like two doors.\n\n\nHowever, the doors when closed shall overlap each other, in such a\nmanner that the lines of one shall fall on the transparent part of the other,\ni.e. when over lapped, the paper should not be seen. \n\n \n\nWhen every thing is ready for enlarging, fix the Bromide\npaper with pieces of cellotape to the base board ( between these two\nrosters).\n\n\nCover the paper with the left hand roster and expose picture\n \" A\"  .\n\n\nThen remove the left hand side roster.\n\n\nNow put right hand side roster on the paper and expose ( after\ninserting the second negative in the enlarger ) picture  \" B\"  .\n\n\nAfter developing and fixing you will get the jumbled up picture.\n\n\n \n\nPaste this jumbled up picture on a stiff base - - say box board\n- - then fix one roster to a glass ( plate stick boarder only with\nstick-o-fast ) .\n\n\nIf now this glass plate ( 1 mm thickness ) with roster is placed\non the picture ( Roster down is in contact with the picture ) - - only one of\nthe two pictures will be seen giving illusion of a clear picture.\n\n\nOn moving the roster through one line the other picture will be\nseen.\n\n\nThus this will resemble the change - - a picture in a cage, through\ncage bars.\n\n\nIf now the glass plate with roster is placed on the jumbled picture\nso that the roster is on top, i.e. about 1 mm away from the jubled picture a\nflicker will result, i.e. on tilting the combination each picture will\nalternately be seen giving you a flicker picture.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d0de2425-7be9-48f1-a2d8-a6aa024043e7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.219673+00:00"}

{"text": "COVER STORY    \n\n\n  CELESTIAL  RINGS           \n\n \n\nANYONE who has ever looked at Saturn through a telescope would agree\nthat the ringed planet is the most beautiful celestial object in the sky.\n\n\nEven in a small, low-powered telescope its distinct shape, unlike\nany other planet of the solar system, can be easily made out.\n\n\nBut the grandeur of its vast ring system becomes apparent only at\nhigher magnifications, and it is a magnificant sight. \n\n \n\nSince their discovery in early seventeenth century Saturn\nremained the undisputed lord of the rings till 1977 when it lost its unique\ndistinction.\n\n\nDuring an occultation study in March that year, rings were discovered\naround another planet, Uranus.\n\n\nTwo years later, photographs of Jupiter sent back by the \n\" Voyager \"  probes showed faint rings around the\nlargest planet of the solar family.\n\n\nFinally, in August 1989, rings around yet another planet came to\nlight - - this time it was Neptune.\n\n\nAll the outer planets, besides their large size, now had another\ncommon feature - - all had ring systems of their own.\n\n\nMuch of the credit for our new found knowledge about celestial rings\ngoes to the two  Voyager  missions which not only made new\ndiscoveries but also revealed the already known rings of Saturn in their\ntrue majesty. \n\n \n\n  PLANETS   , as distinct from\nthe stars, were known to ancient man because of their curious motion in\nthe sky, but their true nature became known much later.\n\n\nIt was only after Galileo turned his telescope towards the heavens\nin 1610 that the planets were first seen as small discs unlike the stars\nwhich appeared as points of light, Galileo had already found the four\nlarge moons going round Jupiter.\n\n\nWhen he turned his telescope to Saturn he noticed what appeared to\nbe a large  ` moon'  on either side of the planet.\n\n\nBut to his surprise, the two moons did not move from night to night\nas did the moons of Jupiter.\n\n\nWhat was more unusual was that  moons appeared fully\nonethird as large as Saturn itself.\n\n\nThe finding was so odd that Galileo didn't dare to publish it as\nsuch.\n\n\nHe wrote,  \" I have observed the furthest planet to be triple\"\n , and published it as an anagram.\n\n\nAs if a large planet with two large stationary moons were not odd\nenough, the two      ` moons' \ndisappeared altogether when Galileo peeped at Saturn through his telescope\nagain two years later, they were back again in 1616, now shaped as two\n ` half-ellipses'  .\n\n\nOver the next four decades, other astronomers observed and drew  changing appearance, some of them remarkably accurate.\n\n\nBut none had the idea of a ring in mind. \n\n \n\nThe idea of a ring around Saturn first came from the Dutch\nastronomer, Christian Huygens.\n\n\nAfter observing the planet for some years with his improved\ntelescope, he realized that all the drawings could be explained if Saturn\nwere  ` surrounded by a thin flat ring, nowhere touching, and\ninclined to the ecliptic'  .\n\n\nLike Galileo, he first published the sentence as an anagram, but\nlater published it uncoded in 1659. \n\n \n\nAs any regular observer of the planet knows, the appearance of\nthe rings changes as Saturn goes round its orbit because of the tilt of its\naxis.\n\n\nOnce evey six years or so the rings appear at a shallow angle when\nthey are fully visible.\n\n\nThen, six years later, as the rings turn edge-on, they become\ninvisible.  \n\n \n\nAs better and more powerful telescopes became available,\neveryone could see the rings.\n\n\nIn 1675, Giovanni Cassini, the first Director of the Paris\nObservatory, discovered that the ring was double - - a thick dark line\nseparated an outering from an inner one.\n\n\nThis gap later became known as  Division. \n\n \n\nBut one puzzle still remained unsolved - - what were the rings\nmade of ?\n\n\nAt first they were thought to be simple ring-shaped solid sheets\nfloating in space encircling the planet.\n\n\nBut this idea had to be given up if the laws of gravitation were to\nhold.\n\n\nFinally, in 1857, the British physicist James Clerk Maxwell came\nup with the now accepted explanation that the rings are made of innumerable\nseparate particles all orbiting Saturn together as a crowd of miniature\nmoons.\n\n\nBut the true complexity of  magnificent ring system\nwas not revealed till  \" Voyager \"  probes sent\nback fabulous close-ups in the early 1980s.   \n\n \n\nWith powerful telescopes the rings of Saturn appear as a series\nof concentric zones of different brightness.\n\n\nAstronomers have identified each zone as a separate ring separated\nby dark divisions, the two major zones flanking \nDivision have been named A and B rings.\n\n\nOther rings, labelled \" C \" to \" G\n\" , have also been identified.\n\n\nOf the lot, the B-ring, stretching over 25,000 km, is the widest and\nbrightest, followed in brightness by the 15,000-km wide A-ring.\n\n\nThe others are mostly faint, thin rings.\n\n\nThe outermost ringcalled E-ring is a very diffuses ring lying beyond\nthe orbits of three Saturnian moons. \n\n \n\nThese arbitrary divisions of the rings, however, appeared\nredundant after the flybys of Saturn by the  \" Voyager \"\n probes.\n\n\nThe  \" Voyager \"  photographs showed that\nthe rings are not made up of large, relatively homogeneous zones as they\nappeared from earth, but are in fact composed of thousands of thin\nconcentric rings, much like the grooves on a gramophone record. \n\n \n\nThe  \" Voyager \"  probes also revealed\nseveral unexplained phenomena such   as\nradial  ` spoke'-like formations on the ring system and\nringlets which were non-circular, eccentric, twisted, wavy, or clumpy.\n\n\nAll these structures pose a new challenge for physicists. \n\n \n\n  URANUS   joined the planetary\nelite in 1977 when a system of rings was discovered during a stellar\noccultation.\n\n\nSerendipity played the key role in the discovery.\n\n\nOn 10 March 1977 the blue planet was to pass in front of a star in\nthe constellation of Libra.\n\n\nAstronomers around the world including teams at \nKavalur and Nainital observatories were all geared up for the event as it\nwould provide them a rare opportunity to study the \natmosphere.\n\n\nThe technique is straight forward - - as the star went behind the\nplanet, its light would dim gradually if the planet had a thick atmospheric\nenvelope disappearing altogether.\n\n\nThe same would  happen, but in reverse\norder, as the star reappeared from behind the planet.\n\n\nIf the planet had no atmosphere, the extincton and reappearance of\nstarlight would be abrupt and almost instantaneous rather than gradual. \n\n \n\nBut that night something quite unexpected happened.\n\n\nNot that scientists are unaccustomed to getting unexpected results,\nbut it is not always that a correct interpretation is so easily forthcoming\nas was in this case.\n\n\nAnalysis of the occultation records showed that the light from the\nstar dipped at least five times before it went behind Uranus.\n\n\nCould it be due to some unknown satellites that were cutting off the\nlight?\n\n\nBut the mystery was soon cleared as identical dips in signal were\nrecorded during the reappearance of the star after the occultation.\n\n\nThe dips, the astronomers soon realized, could only be due to a\nseries of rings around Uranus.\n\n\nFrom the records it was clear that if Uranus indeed had rings, they\nwould be pretty thin and dark - - a far cry from  majestic\nsystem.\n\n\nLater occultation studies led to the discovery of four more rings\nmaking it a total of nine. \n\n \n\nThe first photographic evidence of the rings of Uranus came in\n1983 in       infrared pictures taken with the\nAnglo-Australian telescope.\n\n\nBut their true form was revealed only in  \" Voyager 2\n\"  pictures which showed them clearly as nine tidy bands.\n\n\nThe rings looked much as expected - - narrow, dark, and sharply\ndefined, with few surprises. \n\n \n\nThe third member of the solar family to receive the  `\nringed'  distinction was Jupiter.\n\n\nIt was also an unexpected discovery.\n\n\nThe first pictures of the thin ring of dust girdling the giant  equator came from  \" Voyager I \"  in\n1979.\n\n\nBut  \" Voyager 2 \"  gave more detailed\npictures which showed that the ring has a sharp outer edge, and stretches\ndown, fainter and fainter, towards the  cloud tops. \n\n \n\n  THE   discovery of the rings\naround Jupiter, coming two years after that of the rings of Uranus, gave an\nindication of the fact that the existence of       rings around\nthe giant planets may, after all, be a rule rather than exception.\n\n\nBut Neptune was still left out of the exclusive club as no rings\nhad yet been discovered around it, although there had been speculation about\ntheir existtence.\n\n\nStellar occultation methods, like the one that led to the discovery\nof the Uranian rings, had produced ambiguous results.\n\n\nBut many astronomers believed Neptune had a ring though not a\ncontinuous one.\n\n\nThey imagined  ring to be a discontinuous\n ` ring arc'  unlike any other planetary ring.\n\n\nThey were not entirely wrong, however.\n\n\nPictures sent by  \" Voyager 2 \"  clearly\nshow at least three rings, one of them with material mysteriously clumped\ninto three  ` arcs'  .\n\n\nIt is not known what causes the Neptunian ring particles to clump\ninto arcs. \n\n \n\nIn the last dozen years our conception of planetary rings has\nundergone a revolution.\n\n\nFrom a single planet with rings known as recently as 1977, today we\nknow of four.\n\n\nBut no two of them are identical.\n\n\nJupiter is girdled by a thin diffuse ring; Saturn rules over a\nspectacular bright system with thousands of wide and narrow structures;\nUranus has the narrowest and darkest rings of the lot; while  rings have clumps of matter strung like beads.\n\n\nIn some      <O> caption </O. \nrespects, though, all the ring syst ems show\nsome degree of similarity.\n\n\nThey all lie close to the equatorial planes of their respective\nplanets, and they are all extremely thin, with typical thickness of only\nabout a kilometre.\n\n\nDetailed analyses of the sunlight scattered by the rings of Jupiter\nand Saturn have shown that the Jovian rings are made up of    micron-size particles ( 1 micron = 10-6m) and that the\nparticle size in the rings of Saturn ranges from 5 mm to 5m.\n\n\nThe particle size of the rings of Uranus and Neptune are not known\nbut they are believed to be no larger than a few metres across. \n\n \n\n  THERE   is as yet no single\ntheory that can explain all the planetary rings of the solar system, but it\nis generally agreed that they are all the outcome of a variety of\ngravitational interactions.\n\n\nFor all planetary bodies there is a limiting distance called the\nRoche-limit.\n\n\nAny satellite coming closer than this distance run the risk of being\ndestroyed by strong tidal interactions.\n\n\nIt is speculated that  magnificent rings may have\noriginated from such a destructive event.\n\n\nRings could also be  formed out of\nleft-over matter from planetary accretion.\n\n\nAny such debris lying within the Roche-limit will fail to accrete\ninto larger bodies and continue orbiting the planet in the \nequatorial plane.\n\n\nThere is also evidence that some of the rings are shaped and\nmaintained by gravitational action of small  ` shepherding'\n satellites that orbit the planet at the same distance as the rings.\n\n\n \n\nThe celestial mechanics of ring formation and stability is\nfar too complicated to be expounded here.\n\n\nBut, simply said, planetary rings are a natural consequence of\ntidal forces and collision among particles.\n\n\nFrom their study astronomers expected to learn more about the\nimportant mechanisms that may have shaped our solar system in the distant\npast.  <*> unfilled square </*> <*> tantalizer on page 15, column two\n</*>\n\n\n In the last dozen years our conception of planetary rings\nhas undergone a revolution.\n\n\nFrom a single planet with rings known as recently as 1977, today we\nknow of four.\n\n\nBut no two of them are identical.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "86765fdb-138d-42c0-9740-299c012c99bc", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.222182+00:00"}

{"text": "MATHEMATICS       \n\n \n\n  MANY   laymen regard infinity\nas a kind of number larger than all numbers, but infinity is not a number at\nall.\n\n\nIt is a  concept,  the name of which is derived from the\nLatin word   infinitus   meaning without limit.\n\n\nIt would not be an exaggeration to state that mathematics cannot\nexist without the notion of infinity, because one comes across the\ninfinite in mathematics at almost every turn; there are infinite natural\nnumbers 1, 2, 3, 4 <*> dotted line</*>, there is an infinity of fractions\nbetween any two integers such as 0 and 1; numbers like 1/3, <*> square-root\n</*>  2 and <*> pie </*> have an infinite decimal\nexpansion; there is an infinity of geometrical points in any line,\nstraight or curved, and so on.\n\n\nAs the great German mathematician, David Hilbert ( 1862-1943)\nrightly put it,  \" Mathematics is the science of infinity.\"\n \n\n \n\nThe story of infinity begins with the ancient Greeks, who were\namong the first to recognize infinity as a central issue in mathematics and\nto study its mysteries.\n\n\nIt is a story of many fascinating paradoxes and seemingly absurd\nsituations which have baffled mathematicians for well over 2,000 years.\n\n\nWith their penchant for logical rigour, the ancient Greeks naturally\nhad a deep-rooted suspicion of the infinite and tried to avoid its use at\nany cost, thereby hindering the development of mathematics.\n\n\nUnder the influence of Greek thought, infinity was for a long time\nregarded as the   enfant terrible   of\nmathematics.\n\n\nEven the great Galileo suggested banning its use in  mathematical discourse. \n\n \n\nThe ancient  fear of infinity was prompted to a\nlarge extent by the famous paradoxes of Zeno, a Greek philosopher who lived\nin Elea in the fifth century BC and who is said to have been instructor to\nSocrates.\n\n\nZeno was investigating the question as to whether finite magnitudes (\nof distance and time) are infinitely divisible.\n\n\nHe attempted to show that they are not, as otherwise all motion would\nbe impossible! \n\n \n\nIn his first paradox, known as the paradox of the runner, Zeno\nargued that in order for a runner to move from one place to another, say, 1\nkm away, he must first cover half the distance between the two places, then\nhalf of the remaining distance, then half of what remains next, and so on (\nFig.1).\n\n\nIf we assume that distance could be infinitely subdivided, then\nthis halving process continues   ad infinitum  \nbecause, regardless of how little distance remains to be crossed, it can\nstill be halved.\n\n\nThe distance in kilometres to be covered by the runner may be\nrepresented by the sum of an infinite series ( 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 +\n1/32 ) .\n\n\nSince this would require an infinite number of steps, Zeno argued\nthat the winner would never reach his destination!\n\n\nHe may get arbitrarily close but he would never really get there.\n\n\n \n\nWorse, it would seem that the runner cannot even begin!\n\n\nEmploying a similar argument, it is seen that to go from one place to\nanother, the runner must first cover half the distance, to go half the\ndistance, he must first go one-fourth; to go one-fourth he must first go\none-eighth and so on.\n\n\nAgain, the halves from an infinite sequence.\n\n\nSo how does he get started? \n\n \n\nIn  second paradox, known as the paradox of\nAchilles and the tortoise, the swift-footed Achilles races the slow-moving\ntortoise, giving the latter a head start of 100 m.\n\n\nIf we suppose that Achilles can run 10 times as fast as the\ntortoise, then by the time Achilles covers 100 m, the tortoise would have\nmoved forward by 10 m.\n\n\nBy the time Achilles covers 10 m, the tortoise is 1 m further on.\n\n\nBy the time Achilles covers this 1 m, the tortoise is 1/10 m ahead,\nand so on ( Fig.2).\n\n\n( We are again assuming here that distance can be infinitely\nsub-divided.)\n\n\nThe distance Achilles must travel to be level with the tortoise is\ngiven by the sum of the infinite series ( 100 + 10 + 1 + 1/10 <*> dotted\nline</*> ) .\n\n\nThe  conclusion is that Achilles will never be able\nto catch up with the tortoise; always during the time it takes Achilles  to reach its last position, the tortoise would have\nedged a little forward. \n\n \n\nOf course, Zeno knew fully well that both these conclusions were\nabsurd, but if one followed his line of argument, the conclusions seemed\ninescapable.\n\n\nShould we therefore infer that space and time are not infinitely\ndivisible and that an indivisible unit, an  ` atom'  of space\nor time, would ultimately be reached?\n\n\n other two paradoxes, namely, the paradox of the arrow\nand the paradox of the stadium, also state that space and time can only be\nsubdivided a definite amount.\n\n\nThus the four paradoxes, taken together, seemed to show that space\nand time are neither continuous nor discrete.\n\n\nObviously, something was wrong somewhere. \n\n \n\n paradoxes had to wait another 20 centuries\nbefore they could be resolved, which was possible only with the formulation\nof the concept of the <quote > ` limit'  of a convergent infinite   series.\n\n\nSimply because a series has an infinite number of terms, it does not\nmean that its sum must always be infinite.\n\n\nIt is possible for certain types of infinite series to converge to a\nfinite limit or sum - - a fact which the ancient Greeks did not accept.\n\n\nOnce this fact is accepted, we can assume space and time to be\ninfinitely divisible and the resulting paradoxes can be easily explained\naway. \n\n \n\nFor example, the infinite series ( 100 + 10 + 1 + 1/10 + <*>\ndotted line</*> ) which appeared in  paradox of Achilles and\nthe tortoise, is known to converge to the limit 111.1111 <*> dotted line</*>\nor 111 1/9; that is, as the number of added terms increases to infinity, the\nsum of the series approaches 1/9 as its limit.\n\n\nThe paradox is therefore resolved by observing that Achilles will\novertake the tortoise after he has covered a distance of exactly 111 1/9 m\nfrom his starting point. \n\n \n\nThe resolution of  paradox of the runner is a\nlittle more subtle.\n\n\nStating that the runner will never reach his destination amounts\nto saying that he will take  infinite  time to cover the\ndistance.\n\n\nSo, to resolve the paradox we have to simply show that the runner\nwill reach the end-point after a  finite lapse of time  .\n\n\nNow, the series ( 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + <*> dotted line</*> ) ,\nrepresenting the distance to be covered by the runner, is known to converge\nto the limit 1.\n\n\nIf we assume that the runner maintains a steady speed, the time\nintervals it takes him to cover these distances will also follow the\nsame series and will converge to a finite limit.\n\n\nIn other words, the runner will cover the entire distance in a finite\nspan of time.\n\n\n( It must be borne in mind that many infinite series diverge, the\nsimplest example being the sum of all natural numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + <*>\ndotted line</*> ) .  \n\n \n\nIf the concept of limit of infinite series helped resolve one set\nof paradoxes, it posed new ones - - paradoxes which puzzled mathematicians\nof the 17th and 18th centuries in much the same way as \nparadoxes had puzzled Greek philosophers.\n\n\nConsider, for example, the Grandi series 1-1 + 1-1 + 1-1 + <*> dotted\nline</*> \n\n \n\nRepresenting the series as S, we may write :\n\n\nS = ( 1-1) + ( 1-1) + ( 1-1) + <*> dotted line</*> = 0 + 0 + 0 + <*>\ndotted line</*> = 0\n\n\nBut we can also represent S as, S = 1 + ( - 1+1) + ( - 1+1) + ( -\n1+1) + <*> dotted line</*> = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 <*> dotted line</*> = 1 \n\n \n\nGrandi discovered this series in 1703 and claimed that God must\nhave used a technique based on this series in order to create something from\nnothing, and got the world going. \n\n \n\nIt is possible to manipulate the Grandi series yet another way :\n\n\nS = 1 - ( 1-1 + 1-1 + 1-1 + <*> dotted line</*> ) = 1-S\n\n\nTherefore, 2S = 1, or S = 1/2. \n\n \n\nWhich is the real limit of the Grandi series: 0, 1 or 1/2 ?\n\n\nSurprisingly, none of these is the answer, for the Grandi series does\nnot converge at all; it is a divergent series. \n\n \n\nConsider the infinite series of the reciprocals of natural\nnumbers, with the signs alternating.\n\n\nIt is known to converge to the natural logarithm of 2 ( written in\n2 ) . \n\n\n1/1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - 1/6 + 1/7 - 1/8 + <*> dotted line</*> =\nIn 2\n\n\nIf we multiply both sides of this equation by 1/2, we get: 1/2 -\n1/4 + 1/6 - 1/8 + <*> dotted line</*> = 1/2 In 2  \n\n\nWe now add the two series, term by term vertically.\n\n\n1/1 + 1/3 - 1/2 + 1/5 + 1/7 - 1/4 + <*> dotted line</*> = 3/2 In 2\n\n \n\nThe last series is simply a rearrangement of the first, yet\nits sum is 3/2 of the sum of the original series! \n\n \n\nNow, in our ordinary finite calculations, rearrangement of the\norder of the terms does not affect the value of the sum.\n\n\nThus 1+2+3 = 2+1+3 = 3+2+1.\n\n\nShouldn't this rule apply to the sum of an infinite number of terms\nas well?\n\n\nOur intuition seems to say yes, but then it would lead to the absurd\nresult 1= 3/2.\n\n\nWe must, therefore, conclude that the two infinite sereis are not the\nsame and that in respect of an infinite series, rearrangement of the terms\nmay  sometimes alter the sum. \n\n \n\nWe get the first hint here that the ordinary rules of\narithmetic, always valid for finite calculations, may break down in the realm\nof the infinite.\n\n\nIn an infinite series, rearrangement of the terms may, under certain\nconditions, not only affect the limit to which the series converges, it may\neven change a convergent series into a divergent one. \n\n \n\nThe man who succeeded in taming the mathematical monster of\ninfinity and in placing it on a sound logical footing was the Russian-born\nGerman mathematician Georg Cantor ( 1845-1918 ) .\n\n\nIn a series of highly original papers published between 1874 and\n1897, Cantor laid the foundations of a new  ` arithmetic of infinity'\n .\n\n\nHis results were based on two very simple concepts; that of a set\nand a one-to-one correspondence. \n\n \n\nUntil  time, mathematicians held the view that\nthe infinite had only a potential existence and that there was no actual ( or\ncompleted) infinite.\n\n\nFor example, mathematicians would say that the collection of natural\nnumbers 1, 2, 3, 4, <*> dotted line</*> is potentially infinite because\nevery number can be succeeded by an even larger number, but they would\ndeny that the collection is actually infinite since it does not exist as one\nfinished thing.\n\n\nCantor made a departure from this well established view by accepting\nthe actual infinite as a full-fledged mathematical entity and by insisting\nthat infinite aggregates must be regarded as a  totality  , as an\nobject which our mind should conceive of as a whole.\n\n\nHis concept of a set, and of an infinite set in particular, came in\nhandy in this regard. \n\n \n\nWhat is a set?\n\n\nA set is any collection of objects, physical or mathematical.\n\n\nCantor himself defined a set as  \" a many which allows itself\nto be regarded as a one.\" \n\n\nSets may be either finite ( like the set of letters of the English\nalphabet ) or infinite ( like the set of all natural numbers, the set of all\npoints on a given line etc. ) .\n\n\nA subset is any collection of elements taken from the original\nset and regarded as a new set.\n\n\nThus the set ( a, b, c, d ) is a subset of the set of the letters of\nthe English alphabet.\n\n\nSimilarly, the set of all even numbers and the set of all prime\nnumbers are subsets of the set of all natural numbers. \n\n \n\nThe cocnept of a cardinal number is basic to the theory of sets.\n\n\nIt is a measure of the size of a set, that is, the number of elements\na set contains.\n\n\nFor example, the cardinal of the set S = ( a, b, c, d ) is 4.\n\n\nHow do we specify the cardinal of an infinite set?\n\n\nFor this, we would need an infinite number. \n\n \n\nCantor employed the concept of a one-to-one correspondence to\nfind out whether two sets, finite or infinite, are of the same size or\ndifferent.\n\n\nIt is not necessary, he said, that we should be able to  count\n the number of elements in two different sets in order to say which set\nis larger.\n\n\n( Of course, in case of infinite sets such counting is\nimpossible.)\n\n\nWe can simply match the elements of the two sets on a one-to-one\nbasis; if there is an exact matching, we say that the two sets are equivalent\nor have the same cardinal; if, however, such an exact matching is not\npossible, and in one of the sets some unpaired elements are left, we\nsay that this set is larger ( that is, it has a bigger cardinal) than the\nother. \n\n \n\nNow, there was nothing new about the principle of 1:1 matching.\n\n\nBoth Galileo and the 17th century German scholar Leibnitz had\nemployed it about two centuries earlier and they had  \narrived at the  ` absurd'  conclusion that the infinity of\nnatural numbers is just as large as the infinity of perfect squares or the\ninfinity of even numbers.\n\n\nCantor first set about resolving these two paradoxes.\n\n\nHe made the bold assertion that since an infinite set can be matched\nwith its own subset on a 1:1 basis, the two are in fact equal, and if this\nresult contradicts the maxim,  ` the whole is greater than the part'\n , then the fault lies only with the maxim.\n\n\nThis maxim, Cantor said, is true of finite sets only; in the world\nof the infinite  ` a part is equal to the whole'  .\n\n\nIn fact, he seized upon this strange property as the definition of\nan infinite set:  ` A set S is said to be infinite if it can be\nmatched one to one with a subset of itself; in the contrary case, S is said\nto be finite.' \n\n\nHere the infinite is defined positively, and it is the finite set\nthat is characterized negatively ( as one that is not infinite ) .\n\n\nThus Cantor made a virtue out of what Galileo and Leibnitz regarded\nas a vice.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a514429b-357f-41b7-acec-cf040d195a4c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.224337+00:00"}

Pawar, I am submitting below my scheme on the\nfurther  \ndevelopment of the research activities of the  Kendra\n , for  \nthe consideration of the University authorities. \n\n\nThe scheme has been divided into four parts : \n\n\n( 1) introduction, \n\n\n( 2) achievements, \n\n\n( 3) expectations, and lastly \n\n\n( 4) realization of the expectations.  \n\n\nA)   INTRODUCTION  :  \n\n \n\nKolhapur has been an independent and vibrant\ncentre of research  \nin Maratha history since the turn of the century, when \nRajarshi  \n Shahu  Chatrapati  ( 1874 - 1922)\nencouraged the  \nwriting of a biography of Shivaji the great and provided with\nkind and  \ngenerous    patronage   to\nProfessor V. G.  \nVijapurkar to edit   Granthmala  , \nthrough which a  \nseries of research volumes, containing source-material were\npublished. \n\n\nIt should be remembered that the third, fifth and\neighth volumes of  \n  Marathyancya Itihasachi Sadhane  \nedited by   \nItihasacharya  V. K. Rajwade were published from\nKolhapur in 1901,  \n1905 and 1903 respectively.  \n\n \n\n \n\nShahaji  Chhatrapati  of Kolhapur\ncontinued the  \ntradition of his grand father and brought forth thirteen\nvolumes containing  \nsource-material from Modi - Marathi and Portuguese languages,\nbearing on the  \nhistory of Marathas and ably edited by researchers like M. V.\nGujar,   \nShri  S. M. Garge and Dr. S. P. Shirodkar.  \n\n \n\nDr. A. G. Pawar, an eminent researcher in Maratha\nhistory, as the  \nfirst vice-chancellor of Shivaji University managed to\ncollect, translate and  \nedit in ten volumes a number of Modi-Marathi, Portuguese and\nPersian  \ndocuments, with the help of some research assistants and\nmembers of the  \ndepartment of History.  \n\n \n\nThere was, however, a great need to\ninstitutionalize this  \nresearch work.  \n\n\nB)   SHAHU  SAMSHODHAN KENDRA  :\nACHIEVEMENTS  \n  \n\n \n\nShahu  Samshodhan Kendra  was\ninaugurated by the  \nthen Chancellor and Governor, Nawab Ali Yavar Jang on 28 May\n1970, during the  \nvice-chancellorship of Dr. A. G. Pawar. \n\n\nIn view of the birth centenary of  Rajashri\n Shahu  \n Chhatrapati  in whose name \n\n \n\nthe  Kendra  was founded, the  \nwork of collecting source material on his life and the work\nwas earnestly  \nundertaken. \n\n\nThe first volume entitled   Rajarshi\n Shahu  \n Chhatrapati  Papers  : 1884 - 1894\nAdoption to  \nInstallation was published in 1976.  \n\n \n\nThe work however, could not gain momentum due to\nthe ill health  \nof the first director and other problems regarding the nature\nand finances of  \nthe  Kendra   \n\n \n\nAfter overcoming these problems, Shivaji\nUniversity appointed Dr.  \nV. A. Sangwe the Director and asked Dr. B. D. Khane of the\ndepartment of  \nHistory to associate with the work of the  Kendra\n . \n\n\nThe second, third and fourth volumes of the series\n Rajarshi  \n Shahu  Chhatrapati  Papers edited\njointly by Dr. V.  \nA. Sangwe and Dr. B. D. Khane have been so far published in\nyears 1983, 1985  \nand 1988 respectively.  \n\n\nC)   SHAHU  SAMSHODHAN KENDRA  :\nEXPECTATIONS  \n  \n\n \n\nThough publication of source-material is an\nimportant activity of  \nan essentially historical research institute, there are also\nother equally  \nimportant functions,  viz.  : \n\n\n( 1) managing a research library, \n\n\n( 2) administering an archival cell, \n\n \n\n\n( 3) training young researchers, \n\n\n( 4) providing a meeting place for research scholars\nand \n\n\n( 5) diversification of research activity.  \n\n\n( 1)   Research Library  :  \n\n \n\nThe  Kendra  has at present a\nnucleus of a <-> a  \nresearch library formed by the books donated by Dr. A. G.\nPawar, Dhananjay  \nKeer and Madhvrao Bagal. \n\n\nIt would be necessary to purchase referance books from\nthe  \nbook-sellers, and approach some old colleges with a request to\ndonate  \nreferance books which could be properly maintained and better\nused in the  \n Kendra  . \n\n\nThe other research institutes like Bharat \nItihas Samshodhak  \nMandal  ( Pune), Deccan College ( Pune) along with the\nlibraries of  \nPoona and Bombay Universities could be approached for\nborrowing books and  \nperiodicals. \n\n\nThe  Kendra  could also get photocopies\nof reference  \nbooks from Shivaji University library.  \n\n \n\nThe  Kendra  could prepare a list\nof  \nrefrence-books and periodicals available in the libraries of\nRajaram College  \n( Kolhapur), Willingdon College ( Sangli) and Dayanand College\n( Solapur)  \nwhich would be useful for the researchers.  \n \n\n\n( 2)   Archival Cell  :  \n\n \n\nThe sources-material useful for rewriting the\nsocio-economic  \nhistory of Maharashtra is available in Kolhapur, Pune, Bombay,\nBikaner,  \nSitamau ( M.P.), and National archives. \n\n\nIt is also available in the British Museum and India\nOffice library  \nLondon.  \n\n \n\nIn order to enhance the quality of research-work\nit is necessary  \nfor a researcher to consult these documents. \n\n\nThe  Kendra  should start the\ndevelopment of microfilm  \nlibrary of these documents. \n\n\nSimilarly the microfilms, if not the originals, of the\ndocuments of  \nhistoric families and newspapers could be made. \n\n\nSome documents could be photo-copied and preserved in\nthe Cell.  \n\n \n\nThe archival cell would be of immense use to our\nyoung  \nresearchers.  \n\n\n( 3)   Association of Young Researchers  :\n \n\n \n\nThere is a great and urgent need to harness the\nenergy of  \npromising young student-researchers in the work of the \nKendra  \n .   \n\n\nThese researchers could compile the documents and some\nof them could  \nshoulder the responsibility of writing historical accounts of\nsocio-economic  \nsystems and movements. \n\n\nThe students could be trained in reading Modi-Marathi,\nPortuguese and  \nPersian documents. \n\n\nThe researchers could contribute articles which could\nbe read in  \nseminars and conferences.  \n\n\n( 4)   Meeting Place of Scholars  :  \n\n \n\nThe  Kendra  could organise    on  \n  specific dates every year an annual seminar when\nresearchers in  \nIndia could come to the  Kendra  . \n\n\nThe young student-researchers from the University area\ncould  \ncontribute their research papers in the seminar and would be\nbenefitted by  \nthe academic contact with renowned scholars.  \n\n\n( 5)   Diversification of Research Activity\n :  \n\n \n\nThere is an urgent need of expediting the\npublication of  \ndocuments, from the archives, relating to the life and work of\nShahu   \nChhatrapati  . \n\n\nSimultaneously there is need of diversifying research\nactivities of  \nthe  Kendra  , which could concentrate on \n\n  \n\nthe socio-economic history of the  \nfour districts coming under the jurisdiction of Shivaji\nUniversity. \n\n\nIt could also divert its attention to the nearby\nwestern coast with  \nwhich the Kolhapur state was in contact. \n\n\nThe study of historic families like the Patwardhans,\nNipanikars,  \nKagalkar, Kapashikar, Ichalkaranjikar, Jatkar, Akkalkotkar and\nShaikh Mira of  \nWai - - would be most relevant. \n\n\nSimilarly the thematic studies like agriculture,\ntrade, industry,  \ncommerce and religious centres in the region would be worth\nfurther analysis. \n\n\nThe relations of Kolhapur state with other Indian and\nEuropean powers  \nwould  reveal interesting information. \n\n\nSimilarly Kolhapur and the adjoining region is famous\nfor its  \narcheological remains, art, architecture, sculpture and film\nindustry.  \n\n \n\nIn short, there is  indeed great\nscope for  \ndiversifying the research activity of the  Kendra\n and it  \nshould be undertaken in phased programme which is a necessity\nin view of the  \n   availability   of\npersonnel and  \nresources.  \n\n\nD)   REALIZATION OF THE EXPECTATIONS  :\n \n\n \n\nIt is easy to express the expectations, though its\n\n  \n\nrealization would  \nrequire concerted and purposeful effort, backed by financial\nsupport.  \n\n \n\nThe University authorities should think of\nproviding the   \nKendra  with the necessary infrastructure.  \n\n \n\n1)   Space  :  \n\n\nThe  Kendra  would require sufficient\nspace to house  \nreference library, archival cell, reading room and rooms for\nthe staff.  \n\n \n\n2)   Personnel  :  \n\n\nThe  Kendra  could develop a library of\nmicrofilms of  \ndocuments collected from variious archives. \n\n\nThe necessary technical equipment and assistance\nshould be made  \navailable to the  Kendra  . \n\n\nIt could also utilise the services of modi scribes,\nand persons  \nconversant with Persian, Portuguese language on\ncontract/salary basis. \n\n\nThe  Kendra  could chalk out a course\nof training  \nyoung researchers through direct participation, in these\nhistoric languages  \nand scripts.  \n\n \n\n3)   Publication  :  \n\n\nThe University authorities could explore the\npossibility of  \nmodernising the printing process which would expedite the\nresearch activity  \nof the publication of source-material.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4)   Finances  :  \n\n\nIt would be necessary to raise sufficient funds\nthrough the funding  \nagencies like the U.G.C., alongwith the public and private\nconcerns in the  \nregion.  \n\n \n\nThe realization of the expectations would be\npossible in a  \ngradual manner with the availability of above mentioned\nrequirements.  \n\n\nKolhapur ) ) \n\n\nJanuary 9, 1991 ) \n Sd/- \n\n\nDr. V.

from recent observations that the rate of\nfailure of spacecraft and satellites in orbit is escalating in such a manner\nthat before long the earth will be showered with the debris of these inactive\nspace probes. \n\n \n\nSince 1957, when the Soviet  sputnik became the\nfirst satellite to be launched, thousands of items have been in orbit around\nthe earth, including spent fuel tanks, rocket shells, non-functioning\nsatellites, fragments from satellites and rocket explosions, pieces\ndiscarded during missions such as rocket clamps and shrouds, left-over food\npackages and even shrapnel from explosions in space. \n\n \n\nThe latest estimates are that between 12,000 and 16,000 large\nobjects and pieces are not hurtling through space at speeds of thousands\nof miles per hour.\n\n\nSmaller particles, primarily from some 50 or 60 explosions in space,\nnumber in hundreds of millions.\n\n\nMoreover, the amount of debris is increasing at a rate of about 13 per\ncent each year as more nations launch more and bigger rockets and satellites.\n\n\nIn accordance with the investigation made by Teledyne Brown\nEngineering, it seems there are 2,433 objects in orbit which had so far been\ndetected and about half of the ones we know about are fragments of satellites\nthat have broken apart, usually as the result of an explosion.\n\n\nOf the 83 explosions that have occurred, 590 involved Russian\nrockets. \n\n \n\nIn addition, Russian antisatellite tests have added at least\n500 pieces of junk to the near-earth environment.\n\n\nWith roughly 100 objects launched into space in a year - - five times\nmore than are launched by everyone else combined - - the Russians are\nresponsible for much of the pollution problem in space.\n\n\nBut the Soviet Union is not the only nation to blame.\n\n\nBetween 1973 and 1981, seven American Delta second stages\nexploded, accounting for 1,176 pieces of debris. \n\n \n\nThe most dangerous objects are fragments of accidental\nexplosions because they travel so fast.\n\n\nEven fragments as tiny as one sixteenth of an inch can penetrate most\nspace vehicles.\n\n\nSpace scientists fear that debris may hit and disable some of the\nmore than 1,100 satellites now in orbit, or puncture the manned U.S. space\nshuttle, causing injury or death to astronauts.  \n\n\n  NO DAMAGE  \n\n \n\nWhen the nuclear-powered Soviet surveillance satellite, Cosmos\n954, re-entered the  atmosphere over Canada in 1978,\nfollowing a sudden depressurization, many feared that it might spread\nradiation over that country.\n\n\nBut fortunately no traces of radiation were found.\n\n\nSimilarly, there was much consternation in the summer of 1979 when,\ndespite  effort to ensure that the unmanned Skylab fell\neither into the Indian or the Atlantic oceans, the spacecraft reentered\nthe  atmosphere over Australia.\n\n\nEven though it created a brilliant display in the Australian night\nsky, there was no damage. \n\n \n\nAnother incident, of a similar nature occurred in 1981 when the\nSoviet navigation satellite, Cosmos 1275, suddenly disintegrated in\nspace for no apparent reason at all.\n\n\nIt is possible that because Soviet  navsats  do\nnot carry either internal propellant supplies or destruct packages,\ndisintegration of this military operational payload, a mere seven weeks\nafter the launch, was caused by the impact of a piece of space debris.\n\n\nBy October 1982, some 180 individual fragments of Cosmos 1275 had\nbeen located by the North American Air Defence Command.\n\n\nThese will remain in this particular orbital slot for years to\ncome and will become a hazard to spacecraft orbiting in the region. \n\n \n\nBut what of the geostationary orbit?\n\n\nWhat hazard lies in wait there for some unsuspecting spacecraft?\n\n\nFortunately, at the present time, there is not as much debris at\ngeostationary altitudes as nearer earth, but a potential hazard exists.\n\n\n \n\nThe USA, the Soviet Union, the European Space Agency, Japan\nand India can now place spacecraft in a geosynchronous orbit.\n\n\nThey use a technique whereby the payload and attached rocket stages\nare placed  in a low earth parking\norbit where, during the first revolution after launch, the upper rocket\nstage ignites to put the payload into a geostationary transfer orbit. \n\n\n\n  COMPONENTS  \n\n \n\nThis procedure, especialy during the Soviet launches, leaves\ncomponents in the low parking orbit.\n\n\nThese components re-enter the atmosphere within a few days of the\nlaunch and do not normally pose a hazard to other space traffic.\n\n\nOnce in the highly elliptical transfer orbit, with an orbital apogee\nnear the geosynchronous altitudes but inclined between 10 and 47 degrees (\nfor Soviet spacecrafts) to the equator, the launch vehicle stage is\njettisoned.\n\n\nIt remains in this orbit and poses little danger to geostationary\nspacecraft. \n\n \n\nWhen the spacecraft is separated into a similar elliptical\ntransfer orbit, ground commands initiate spacecrafts apogee injection\nrocket motor firing at an equator crossing-point near apogee.\n\n\nThis pushes the payload into the geostationary orbit.\n\n\nIt is here that one source of geosynchronous debris originates.\n\n\nThe majority of U.S. communication satellites use an apogee injection\nmotor which is integral to the payload structure.\n\n\nAfter firing, this remains a part of the spacecraft and does not\nbecome a separate object. \n\n \n\nBut the Soviet communication satellites behave differently.\n\n\nTheir apogee motors are attached to the outside of the spacecrafts\nstructure.\n\n\nAfter firing, these are separated by a spring mechanism.\n\n\nAlthough the spacecraft is controlled from the ground and commanded\nto move around the geostationary orbit until the desired location is reached,\nthe spent apogee motor is left to dift.\n\n\nThe Soviet apogee motors measure about two metres by two metres\nand are liquid fuelled.\n\n\nAny propellant remaining in the motor after firing is usually\nvented through the engine to provide further separation from the main\nspacecraft. \n\n \n\nMost of these apogee motors, around 30 to date, are currently\ntracked by American sensors, so their orbits and positions are known.\n\n\nBut there are about a dozen of these whch are not tracked.\n\n\nThese are drifting aimlessly and intersect the geostationary altitude\nat widely varying longitudes.\n\n\nThe potential for collision hazards from these apogee motors is quite\nhigh. \n\n \n\nPlacing a spacecraft in a geostationary orbit is a complex\noperation.\n\n\nOccasionally things go wrong and they are placed in incorrect\norbits and may or may not be under control from the ground.\n\n\nThe first and second Japanese experimental communication\nsatellites, for example, were both placed in incorrect orbits and are\nnow drifting around the earth, the first in a  \" sub-synchronous\"\n orbit below the geostationary altitude, and the second in a \n\" supersynchronous\"  orbit above the geostationary orbit in\neastward and westward directions respectively. \n\n \n\nFinally, one misconception about space is that what goes up\nmust come down, or that space is self-cleaning.\n\n\nMany of the satellites in the upper reaches of the orbit will never\nreturn to the earth.\n\n\nBut most of those placed in orbits below about 300 miles, where the\natmosphere is relatively dense, either burn up or come down to the earth\nwithin a few years.\n\n\nAbove 300 miles, orbital life increases rapidly.\n\n\nAt 700 miles, most spacecraft will remain in orbit for hundreds of\nyears.\n\n\nSmaller fragments are more sensitive to atmospheric drag and will\nre-enter earlier. \n\n \n\nThe removal of the sources of fragments in orbit is the most\nimportant means of controlling the proliferation of debris.\n\n\n\" NASA \" has already taken steps to minimize the\npossibility of accidental explosions in space.\n\n\nBut an international treaty may be required to prevent intentional\nexplosions or to restrict them to low altitudes from which the fragments\nwould quickly re-enter the atmosphere and burn up. \n\n \n\n\" NASA \" studies to determine the feasibility of\nusing the space shuttle to retrieve non-functioning satellites show that\nabout one-half of the orbiting satellites can be reached.\n\n\nBut because they were not designed to be retrieved, there could be\nproblems with harnessing them and storing them in the shuttle.\n\n\nIn addition, only one satellite can be recovered on each launch\nsince the shuttle does not usually have sufficient fuel to pursue and\ncapture a second satellite.\n\n\nFor these reasons, retrieval by the space shuttle may be too\nexpensive. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, disposal of a space satellite is more\neconomical when it is planned before the satellite is launched.\n\n\nOnly a small force will cause a satellite to re-enter the atmosphere,\nand that force can come from small rockets added to the spacecraft.\n\n\nGravitational forces of the sun and the moon can also be used to\nalter the orbit of an object so that it re-enters the atmosphere.  \n\n\n  COLLISION  \n\n \n\nIt is obviously necessary to remove debris for the safety of\nsatellites.\n\n\nThe probability of devastating impact on permanent facilities like\nthe manned space station planned for the 1990s causes concern.\n\n\nThough the threat of space junk is now most serious in orbits between\n540 and 600 miles up in the sky - - above that of the space station - - much\nof this material will  \" rain down\"  to lower regions.\n\n\nAs a result, the station may collide with an object large enough\nto penetrate it as often as once every 10 years and it will be pelted by\nsmaller debris and micrometeoroids much more often. \n\n \n\nIn conclusion, it can be said that several procedures can\nreduce the risk of future space missions from orbital debris.\n\n\nSome of these are expensive; others are not.\n\n\nBut the problem must be faced, Future space structures, designed for\nlong missions, are likely to be larger and lighter with the use of composite\nmaterial and, therefore, even more sensitive to penetration by small\npieces of manmade objects.\n\n\nAdding the weight required to protect such structures from\nspace debris may well increase the cost of space activities so much that\nfuture space missions may become too expensive to be undertaken.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6f2d801b-d781-4f1d-a3b2-b8ab45b3d001", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.227056+00:00"}

PIMENTA, Officer-Central Excise, Pfizer Ltd., Bombay.\n\n \n\n  AFTER   the enactment of\nCentral Excises and Salt ( Amendment ) Act, 1985, the office of the Collector\nof Central Excise has assumed greater importance.\n\n\nOrdinarily, under the Act, the show cause notice has to be issued\nwithin six months from the relevant date.\n\n\nHowever, proviso to section 11A ( I) stipulates that a notice can be\nissued within five years from the relevant date if, the non-levy, short levy,\nor erroneous refund has occurred on account of any of the following\nconditions viz., - -  ( a)  fraud;  ( b)  collusion  (\nc)  wilful mis-statement or suppression of facts; and  ( d) \ncontraventions of any of the provisions of the Central Excises and Salt Act,\n1944, or rules made thereunder, with an intent to evade payment of duty. \n\n \n\nThe notice which is contemplated under proviso to section 11A ( 1)\nis mandatory in nature and condition precedent before any action is to be\ntaken under the said proviso, for recovery of duties short levied or short\npaid, erroneously refunded for breach of any of the conditions laid down\ntherein, which seeks to invoke the extended period of limitation specifically\ndevised by the Parliament. \n\n \n\nThis extraordinary power of invoking the extended period of\nlimitation of five years under proviso to section 11A(1) now vests in the\nCollector of Central Excise by virtue of the Central Excises and Salt (\nAmendment ) Act, 1985.\n\n\nThe object of bringing about this amendment is made clear in the\nStatement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Central Excises and Salt (\nAmendment ) Bill, 1985, which states that, show cause notice in regard to\nduty of excise short levied or short paid, etc. by reason of fraud,\ncollusion, or any wilful mis-statement or suppression of facts should be\nissued and such cases decided by the Collector of Central Excise instead of\nAssistant Collector of Central Excise. \n\n \n\nNow the question of law that arises and which is subject matter of\nconflicting decisions of various tribunals and Courts, is that whether the\nCollector includes Additional Collector as contemplated in proviso to section\n11A ( 1) to the Act.\n\n\nBut unfortunately, there is no clear cut decision on this vital\npoint, which has resulted in controversies between the assessees and the\nExcise Department. \n\n \n\nThe word  ` Collector'  is not defined in the Act,\nbut rule 2 (  2  ) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, defines\nthe word which means: ( A) in relation to excisable goods other than Salt - -\n<*> dotted line</*> ( B) in relation to Salt, the Salt Commissioner; and\nincludes Additional Collector and any officer specifically authorised under\nrule 4 or rule 5 to exercise throughout any State or any specified area\ntherein all or any of the powers of a Collector under these rules. \n\n \n\nThe definition of Collector as defined in rule 2 (  2\n ) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, was a matter of controversy\nbetween various decisions of tribunals,   inter alia \n, \" Khatri Biri Works, Beawar v. Collector of Central Excise ;\nJaipur \"  [ 1983 E.L.T. 645 ( C.E.G.A.T. ) ;  \"\nSunil Kumar Ghosh v.

Collector of Central Excise and others\n\"  ( 1983 E.L.T. 1057 ( C.E.G.A.T. ) ] \n\n \n\nThis controversy was laid to rest by the decision of Calcutta\nHigh Court which examined the issue in detail in case of  \"\nBansal Industrial Gases ( Bihar ) Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise\n\"  [ 1988 ( 37 ) E.L.T. 347 ( CAL. ) ] , wherein the Court has\nheld that the post of Additional Collector of Central Excise is the same and\nequivalent to the post of Collector. \n\n \n\nHowever, it is to be noted that the decision of Calcutta High\nCourt referred to above was in the context of sections 33, 35 and 35B of the\nAct, which is not the issue at present. \n\n \n\nThere is an equally applicable decision of the Special Bench in\nthe case of  \" Mahavir Products v. Collector of Central Excise,\n\"  [ 1989 ( 41 ) E.L.T. 491 ( Tribunal ) ] , wherein the\nappellant had raised the preliminary objection on the ground that after the\nAmendment Act of 1985, the Collector was not empowered under the Act to have\nthe proceedings transferred to himself from the Additional Collector.\n\n\nHowever, while negativating the above contention of the Appellant,\nthe Tribunal observed as follows:\n\n\n \" The objection is not valid for two reasons.\n\n\n First,  what happened on 27. 12. l985 was that by amendment\nof sections 11A ( I) and ( 2), Collector became the competent adjudicating\nauthority in cases in which proviso to section 11 A ( I) ( for extending the\nlimit of 5 years ) had been invoked.\n\n\nSince in the present case, the said proviso had been invoked, there\nwas nothing wrong in transferring the proceedings to the Collector.\n\n\n Secondly,  both the Additional Collector and the Collector\nhad jurisdiction to adjudicate in the matter.\n\n\nBoth were proper officers.\n\n\nBoth were competent adjudicating authorities under section 33 and\nfurther under rule 2 (  2  ) ,  ` Collector' \nby definition, included Additional Collector as well.\n\n\nThe appellants cannot complain of any prejudice or illegality so long\nas their case was adjudicated upon by another officer having jurisdiction\nafter due notice to them and after granting them a fresh personal hearing.\n\n\nThere is no merit in the  point that the\nproceedings before the Collector were without jurisdiction\"  . \n\n \n\nHowever, it is respectfully submitted that, the observation of\nCEGAT in case of  \" Mahavir Products \"  supra is\nnot correct, because in the statement of Objects and Reasons of the Central\nExcises and Salt ( Amendment ) Bill, 1985, it was specifically and\ncategorically stated that, show cause notice in regard to duty of excise\nshort levied or short paid, etc. by reason of fraud, collusion, or any wilful\nmis-statement or suppression of facts  should be\nissued and such cases decided by the Collector of Central Excise instead of\nAssistant Collector. \n\n \n\nIn this connection, it is relevant to mention the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of  \" Rib Tapes ( India) Pvt. Ltd\n\" and Another \" v. Union of India and Others, \"\n [ 1986 ( 26 ) ELT 193 ( S.C. ) ] herein it was held:  \" It is\nnot in dispute that in order to interpret a particular provision and to infer\nintention of the Legislature, the Objects and Reasons stated in the Bill,\nwhen it is presented to the Legislature could be used\"  . \n\n \n\nIt, therefore, follows that the Collector of Central Excise, who\nhas been named the only person in the Central Excises and Salt ( Amendment )\nBill, 1985, is the sole authority in whom the power to issue show cause\nnotice as well as to adjudicate upon the same under proviso to section 11 A (\n1) is vested after the amendment. \n\n \n\nHowever, it is to be borne in mind that the Central Board of\nExcise and Customs, in exercise of the powers conferred by clause ( b) of\nsection 2 of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, and rule 4 of the\nCentral Excise Rules, I944, has been empowered to appoint such officers as it\ndeems fit and invest in him such powers as may be specified in the\nnotification issued in this behalf. \n\n \n\nThis provision as contained in the Act and rules made thereunder\ncannot override the express provision of proviso to section 11 A ( 1).\n\n\nThe Additional Collector of Central Excise, who is an authority\nsubordinate to the Collector of Central Excise cannot usurp the jurisdiction\nof the Collector for the purpose of proviso to section 11 A ( 1).\n\n\nIf that was the intention in law, then Parliament would have so\nexpressed it.\n\n\nHowever, it is respectfully stated that as per proviso to section 11\nA ( 1), the power has been exclusively vested in the hands of the  \"\nCollector\"  and Parliament has not anywhere in the Act defined the\nexpression  ` Collector'  as including an Additional Collector\nor any other officer.\n\n\nIn this connection, it would be relevant to mention the decision of\nCEGAT in  \" D.C.W. Limited v. Collector of Central Excise,\nMadurai \"  ( 1988 ( 35) E.L.T. 167 ( Tribunal ) , wherein it\nwas held:  \" The Central Excise Act has been amended by Central\nExcises and Salt ( Amendment ) Act, 1985, with effect from 27. 12. 1985 to\nthe effect that after the amendment, the show cause notice for recovery of\nduty falling under the proviso to section 11 A ( 1) shall have to be issued\nonly by the Collector of Central Excise and also the Collector is required to\ndetermine the amount of duty excess demanded in the said show cause notice.\n\n\nIn other words, the  Collector alone is given the exclusive\njurisdiction to issue the show cause notice as well as to determine the\namount of duty demanded\"  .  \n\n \n\nThere is also a decision of the South Regional Bench of the\nTribunal in  \" Punalur Paper Mills Ltd v. Collector of Customs,\nCochin \"  [ 1987 ( 31) ELT 770 ( Tribunal ) ] wherein it was\nheld that  \" the show cause notice for recovery of duty for a period\nbeyond six months under that section has to be issued by the collector.\"\n \n\n \n\nNow, another question which arises is that, whether the order\npassed pursuant to adjudication by the Additional Collector under proviso to\nsection 11 A ( 1) after the Amendment Act of 1985 would be  non-est \nin law and, therefore, void   ab initio  .  \n\n \n\nSince the Collector is mandatorily required under proviso to\nsection 11 A ( 1) to issue show cause notice as well as to adjudicate upon\nthe same, it follows, that, if any show cause notice is issued by the\nAdditional Collector under proviso to section 11 A ( 1), the hearing and\nadjudication, and passing of the order upon such adjudication would be a\nnon-entity in law, i.e., without jurisdiction and would be nullity since\njurisdiction cannot be conferred either by consent or by executive\ninstructions, if any.\n\n\nIn this connection, it is relevant to mention the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of  \" Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan\n\"  [ AIR 1954 S.C. 340 ] wherein Justice Venkatramma Ayyar\nobserved as follows:  \" It is a fundamental principle well established\nthat a decree passed by a Court without jurisdiction is a nullity and that\nits invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be\nenforced or relied upon, even at the stage of execution and even in\ncollateral proceedings.\n\n\nA defect of jurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial or\nwhether it is in respect of the subject matter of the action, strikes at the\nvery authority of the Court to pass any decree and such a defect cannot be\ncured even by the consent of the parties\"  . \n\n \n\nIt is a well settled position in law, clinched by catena of\ndecision of tribunals and courts, that show cause notice invoking extended\nperiod of five years under proviso to section 11 A ( I) has to be issued by\nthe Collector himself; otherwise, a show cause notice issued by any other\nofficer other than the Collector would not be legal and proceedings in\npursuance of such notice would be legally untenable as may be seen, \n inter alia   in the following decisions: \n\" Mysore Prefabs and Prefabs India v. Collector of Central Excise\n\"  [ 1987 ( 27) ELT 487 ] ; \" Gujarat State Fertilisers\nCo. Ltd. and Another v.  Union of India and Others \"  [\n1988 ( 34) ELT 4421 ] ; and  \" H. Guru Instruments ( North India )\nPut Ltd. v.

{"text": "Solar cell  : - \n\n \n\nIn       world, when\nwe are on the edge of 20th  century, the\nmain problem of fuel is arising.\n\n\nThe conventional sources are rapidly decreasing & vanishing day by\nday.\n\n\nThe wood, the natural oil, natural gas are vanishing.\n\n\nSo the    powerful   item to get the\nenergy is to utilise the  sun energy  .\n\n\nSun is whole day shining & therefore we can use the sunlight for\nstoring the energy in the form of heat. \n\n \n\nThe useful instrument to acquire the solar energy is  Solar\ncell  . \n\n \n\n\" Solar cell \" absorbs the sun energy in the form\nof heat & stores it    so   that we can utilise\nthis form of heat energy in the industrial purposes. \n\n \n\nWe have to discuss here, firstly the front view nature of solar\ncell. \n\n \n\nIn the one panel of solar cell, so many solar cells are\nconstructed according to their purpose in the function. \n\n\n  Diagram of solar cell  : -   \n\n\nThe solar cell consists of the main components as - - - > ( 1) An\nabsorber of good quality ( 2) Coverage material ( 3) Insulating material ( 4)\nStorage section\n\n\n  Description  : - 1)  Absorber  : - \n\n \n\nIn solar cell, the <*> right justification </*>  black points\n of 2 - 50 cm in diameter  ( and it  absorbs light energy  )\n are constructed.\n\n\nThe \" absorber \" is of such type that the absorption\ncoefficient of the material should be very high & it shows  low emission\ncoefficient in the infrared light  .\n\n\nAbsorbers are generally black in    colour \n because absorptivity of black colour is  the  highest. \n\n\n 2) Covering material : - \n\n \n\nThe solar cells are constructed on the insulating material which\nis conducting because the heat absorbed by the black spots is transferred by\nusing conducting surface.\n\n\nThe whole solar cell panel is covered by the glass material, which is\nactive for sunlight & low active for infrared light. \n\n\n 3) Insulating material : - \n\n \n\nThe stored energy in the form of heat should not be released, so\nthe insulating material is used to keep the heat in storage section. \n\n\n 4) Storage section : - \n\n \n\nGenerally water or rocks are used for the purpose of storing.\n\n\nSilver salts can also store the solar energy 6 times larger to that\nof water. \n\n \n\nThus in working of solar cell, when the absorber absorbs the\nsolar energy, then they are converted into electric energy by using photo\nvoltaic cell.\n\n\nThus the diameter or dimensions of photo cell are of 2 x 10\ncm2 in area. \n\n \n\nThe flowing water is used as solar absorbing or conducting\nmaterial. \n\n \n\nSo in  world, it becomes an essential thing. \n \n\n\n2)   Soft & hard magnets  : - \n\n \n\nAccording to the use & the hysterisis curve the magnets are\ndivided into two types\n\n\n1) Soft magnets\n\n\n2) Hard magnets. \n\n\n  SOFT MAGNETS  : - \n\n \n\nSoft magnets are very useful in the construction of transformer\ncores i.e. in the power sensitive devices, the soft magnets    play   an important role. \n\n \n\nSoft magnets are the magnets whose domain walls are mobile or\neasy to move.\n\n\nThus soft magnets are easy to move when an external field is applied.\n\n\n   Energy   for 50 to 60 Hz frequency\nof A.C. the soft magnet behaves as a very useful tool for transformer    cores.  \n\n\nThe hysterisis loop for the soft magnet is very small in area on\nB.H. curve.   \n\n \n\nIn the hystersis diagram, it is seen that the power consumption\nis very small because area covered by hysterisis is very small. \n\n \n\nSo in the electric components such as wires, transformers\netc., soft magnets are used. \n\n\n2)   HARD MAGNETS  : - \n\n \n\nIn hard magnets domain walls do not move easily when external\nfield is applied.\n\n\nThus for a.c. power purposes hard magnets are not useful.\n\n\nBut still, they are the    permanent \n magnets.\n\n\nBecause hysterisis loss for the hard magnet is greater as compared to\nthe soft magnets.   \n\n \n\nHard magnets have high initial permiability & maximum corecivity.\n\n\nTherefore in making the industrial mechanical parts or flywheels,\naeroplanes, the hard magnets are used. \n\n \n\nThe usefulness of hard magnet is not in  domainwall\nproperty, but it lies in the brittleness & high strength property. \n\n \n\nThis is all about the soft magnets & hard magnets.  \n\n   \n\n\n  Type - 1 super conductors  : - \n\n \n\nAccording to the degree of superconducting states, the\nclassification of super conductors is done. ( 1) Type - 1 superconductor :\n- \n\n \n\nWhen the superconductors are placed in the magnetic field, then\nat a certain critical magnetic field, there is transition of the electrons\nfrom lower state to excited state.\n\n\nAnd the resistivity of metal becomes zero.\n\n\nThis state of the superconductor is called as the type - 1\nsuperconductors. \n\n \n\nType - 1 superconductors are also called as soft superconductors.\n\n\nThey are having the critical / transition   \ntemperature   same for same material.\n\n\nTherefore type - 1 superconductors are used in the wires ( electric )\netc. \n\n\n( 2)  Type - 2 superconductor : - \n\n \n\nIn type - 2 superconductors, there is the transition of the\nelectrons, excluding flux at the certain point Hcl called as lower conducting\nfield. \n\n \n\nIn this state  it acts as superconductor\n\n\nBut still increasing the electric & magnetic field, it becomes normal\nmetal at point HC2 called as upper conducting state. \n\n \n\nThus type - 2 superconductors have the two states HC1 & HC2   \" type - 2 super conductors \"\nare also called hard superconductors which are useful in the large scale\nindustrial purposes. \n\n \n\nThus in \" type - 1   \nsupercunductor   \" flux is totally excluded at the Hcl\npoint.\n\n\nBut in \" type - 2    superconductor\n  \" the flux is not excluded totally at Hcl but it remains &\nat point Hc2 it  is  totally excluded.  \n\n \n\n\n  Meissner effect  : - \n\n \n\nMeissner effect is very useful effect while considering the\nB.C.S. theory of superconductors.\n\n\nWhen thesuperconducter is cooled in the magnetic field B, then the\nflux inside the material is totally pushed outside it.\n\n\nThis effect is  below transition temperature.\n\n\nThis is called as \"  Meissner effect  \" .\n  \n\n \n\nIn fig ( 1) normal state of superconductor is shown in which\nmagnetic flux lines are passing through the material.\n\n\nBut at HC, critical field, at cooling rate of the transition    temperature,   the magnetic flux lines are pushed\noutside so that there are no    magnetic   flux\ninside the material & the resistivity of material is nearly equal to zero so\nthat large amount of current can flow through it. \n\n \n\nThe Meissner effect is mathematically shown as - - \n\n\nMeissner effect is very useful while considering the B.C.S. ground\nstate of superconductors. \n\n \n\nThus in words, lastly it is shown that,\n\n\nWhen the superconducting material is cooled below the transition \n  temperature   at HC, the magnetic flux lines are\npushed outwards.  \n\n \n\n\n  Point defects  : - \n\n \n\nPoint    defect   is the main\nfeature of the solid state crystals i.e. there are point defects in solids so\nthat the useful applications are from point defects i.e.   \nthe   crystal with point defects are    shown on\n     colour   the growing property & the\ninterstitial state of the crystal. \n\n \n\nThere are two types of defects according to their  lattice\nvacancies  : ( 1) Schottky defect. ( 2) Frenkel defect.\n\n\nThe concept of lattice vacancies arises due to the point defects.\n\n\nIn the crystal, if there is one place empty of the electron, then the\nlattice vacancy  is  created.\n\n\nLattice vacancy is the empty state of crystal  where there\nis no +ve or -ve charge present according to their intial electronic\nperiodic arrangement.  \n\n \n\nGenerally, lattice vacancy is showed in crystal structure by the\nsquare <*> the word ` square' is double underlined </*>   \nin the   above fig,    there   is lattice\nvacancy of the -ve ion\n\n\nLattice vacancy is created due to the point defects. \n\n\n  1) Schottky defect  : - \n\n \n\nIn schottky defect, the atom is taken from \ninterstial planer or regular plane & it  is  taken out from it &\nplaced at the surface of the crystal layer.\n\n\nThis is called \" schottky defect \" .\n\n\nGenerally in alkali halides, lattice vacancies are created due to\nschottky defect.\n\n\nThus, when schottky defect arises, the density of the crystal reduces\n& it becomes less dense    because  \nvacancy is created. \n\n\n  2) Frenkel defect  - - \n\n \n\nIn this type of defect the atom in the regular plane is taken out\n& placed in the interstitial position    between  \ntwo regular planes.\n\n\nThis defect is called as Frenkel defect.\n\n\nHere also, the density of crystal reduces while performing frenkel\ndefect.\n\n\nGenerally, the silver halides shows Frenkel defect as lattice vacancy\nis created    \n\n \n\nTo show that elastic strain energy of screw dislocation is 2 / 3\nof the edge dislocation of the same length in same material, we have to\nderive some mathematical    expressions   :\n-   \n\n\nTherefore    \ndue   to the sharing stress, edge dislocation exists & due to\nlongitudinal stress, screw dislocation exists.  \n\n\nAccording to the the, Es = total elastic energy. \n\n\nAccording to the shearing stress, when elastic strain energy of screw\ndislocation is 2 / 3 to that of edge dislocation. \n\n \n\nIn edge dislocation, the energy for the dislocation arises  due to the shearing stress & in screw dislocation whole pattern\nis slipped due to the longitudinal stess. \n\n\n<*> mathematical notation for ` therefore' </*>  Therefore  Gb\nis the  function for elastic energy  . \n\n \n\nFrom eqn 1 <*> 1 circled </*> it is seen that Es for\nscrew dislocation is  equal to the 2 / 3 energy of edge\ndislocation. \n\n \n\n\n  Colour Centres  : - \n\n \n\n   colour   centres are the point\ndefects or they are formed due to the lattice vacancy.\n\n\nColour centres are formed due to the lattice vacancy of the -ve ion\nor +ve ion. \n\n \n\nGenerally colour centres are helpful to show the colour nature\nof NaCl crystal  etc. \n\n \n\nWhen the Alkali crystal is heated in contact with \nown vapours, then the Nacl crystal becomes blue in colour.\n\n\nThis is why, colour centres are useful for the investigation of\ncrystal defects. \n\n ( 1) Colour centres are called as the \"  F-centre \n\" also. F - centre is    named   because,\nit comes from Greek    word     Farb\n -  for colour <*> the word ` colour' is double underlined\n</*>\n\n \n\nSo in general F - centre is an electron vacancy in the crystal.\n  \n\n \n\nIn fig. ( a) it is seen that there is -ve ion vacancy or\nelectron vacancy.\n\n\nThis electron vacancy in crystal  is  called as F - centre.\n\n\nThe neighbouring F -    centre   forms\nthe M centre as shown in fig. ( b)\n\n\nThree K - centres    form   the R -\ncentre.\n\n\nIt is also easy to form the F - centre having hole as vacancy.\n\n\nIn the study of electron spin resonance technique the invention of F\n- centre is done.\n\n\nIt was seen that, there is absence of electron in crystal & that\nexcess electron     shares    or forms\ncloud around that lattice vacancy.\n\n\nThe electron can share  energy with nearest +ve ions /\natoms.\n\n\nThus colour centres are formed.   \n\n In general, colour centres    absorb   the\nlight of certain wavelength, therefore some crystals are coloured in nature.\n\n\n \n\nTo investigate point defects, colour centres are helpful. \n\n\n \n\n\n  Nematic mesophase  : - \n\n \n\nThe mesophase word is used to give the information about the\nliquid crystals. \n\n \n\nThe Greek word  Mesos   means  \" intermediate \" &  phase  means\n\" state \" .\n\n\nThus the intermediate state between crystaline & isotopic state is\ncalled as the mesophase or liquid crystals. \n\n \n\nThere are three different mesophases. <*> serial unmber 1 to 3\nare circled </*> 1 Nematic mesophase 2 Cholesteric mesophase 3 Smectic\nmesophase.\n\n\nWe discuss here in detail \" nematic mesophase \" .\n\n\n\n  Nematic mesophase  : - \n\n \n\nNematic mesophase is the first state in performing the liquid\ncrystals. \n\n \n\nThe meaning of nematic mesophase is that in Greek,  \n`  Nematos  means \"    thread\n  like \" '  \n\n\nThe nematic mesophase is a  turbid  &  mobile state\n i.e. it is muddy state & also it is mobile state.\n\n\nThe nematic phase  looks likes as  shown  below -\n-  \n\n\nThe direction of the propogation of the phase is shown by the vector\n\" n \" called as director axis. \n\n \n\nThe Nmatic mesophase is a three-dimensional state of liquid in\nwhich the nematos are oriented in three dimension any where in the phase.\n\n\nThey are not layered structures like the smectic mesophase. \n\n\n  Properties of nematic mesophase  : -  <*> serial\nnumber 1 to 3 are circled below </*>\n\n\n 1 Order parameter : - \n\n\nThe nematic mesophase is the disorder state    because   they orient in three   \ndimensions  \n\n\n2 The nematic mesophases   have the\ndirection of director in apposide directions anywhere.  \n\n\n3 Nematic mesophase have the structure in the ring compound\ngenerally.\n\n\nThis is the first state of liquid crystal so the state is very\nmobile & the main feature of it is in the muddy state. \n\n\n  Applications  : - \n\n \n\nNematics are used in the liquid crystal displays, in the\nmicrosurgery, in the magnetic disks, computers, also in the aeroplanes & the\nmost important use is in the eye hospitals & in the signal control devices.\n\n\nExamples of nematic mesophase are - -   \n\n \n\n\n  Chemical constitution  : - \n\n \n\nThe most chemical constitution of liquid crystal is in the study\nof the phase of liquid crystal i.e. in study of the structure of crystal.\n\n\n \n\nAs the state is viscous & mobile, the dilution state is defined\nusing liquid crystal, nematics. \n\n \n\nThe conversion from the crystal state to liquid state & vice\nversa is studied by the enantiotropism & metatropism. \" C - SB - SC -\nSA - I \"\n\n\nThe state of isotropic liquid & the crystal is defined in terms of\nliquid crystal.\n\n\nTherefore the nematic mesophases are used in investigating the\nchemical composition of crystals.\n\n\nAlso, the state of purification & others", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "49b2edd4-bafe-4aa9-88c6-15a474512aa1", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.229227+00:00"}
{"text": "Uncovering the mysteries of  the atom  \n <*> broad red line on \" the atom \" </*>  \n\n \n\nTHIS  Nobel\nPrize for physics went to prof Clifford G Shull of the US and Prof\nBertrand N Brock-house of Canada, for work they did four decades ago.\n\n\nSince then, neutron scattering, a technique developed by Professors\nShull and Brockhouse to probe matter at the atomic level, has complemented\nother methods of unveiling the fascinatingly varied structure and\nbehaviour of matter.\n\n\nToday, neutron techniques are considered invaluable tools for\nphysicists, chemists and material scientists all over the world. \n\n \n\nWhile the  work   was complementary, in actual fact they worked independently of\neach other, and were brought together by the Nobel.\n\n\nIn simple terms, Prof Shull looked at the structure of atoms,\nProfessor Brockhouse at their behaviour. \n\n \n\nThe building blocks of matter, atoms are made of three parts:\nprotons ( which are positively charged ) and neutrons ( which are uncharged )\n, which are found in the atomic nucleus, and negatively charged electrons,\nwhich are outside the nucleus.\n\n\nThe number of electrons in an atom equals the number of protons,\nmaking the atom electrically neutral. \n\n \n\nThe true nature of these subatomic particles is enigmatic.\n\n\nSometimes, they behave like particles; other times \nmore like waves.\n\n\nTake, for instance, electrons.\n\n\nWhen they create pictures on the television screen, they are behaving\nlike particles.\n\n\nBut when  used in an electron microscope, they behave\nlike waves. \n\n \n\nShull and Brockhouse were the first to use neutron waves to probe\nmatter.\n\n\nThey did so using the technique of neutron scattering.   \n\n \n\nWhat exactly is neutron scattering?\n\n\nA beam of neutrons is sent in the direction of a sample to be\nstudied.\n\n\nWhen the neutrons collide with the atomic nuclei in the sample, some\nof them change their direction and energy.\n\n\nScientists can get a lot of information by looking at these changes.\n\n\n \n\nNeutron scattering needs a vast supply of moving neutrons ( one\nmillion million, or 10 to the power of 12, passing through one square\ncentimetre each second ) .\n\n\nThe most common sources for such neutrons are nuclear reactors and\nparticle accelerators. \n\n \n\nBy examining a beam of scattered neutrons, scientists can\ngather information about the arrangement of atoms in a given material, and\ntheir dynamics - - their atomic vibrations.\n\n\nEvery material has unique atomic vibrations, something like a\nfingerprint.\n\n\nMany properties of a material, like its specific heat ( the thermal\nenergy needed to increase the temperature of one kilogram by one degree\nCentigrade ) , depend on its atomic vibrations. \n\n \n\nX-rays and electrons have been probing matter even before\nneutrons came on the scene.\n\n\nBut neutrons sense atomic nuclei, they can differentiate between\nlight and heavy atoms, which X-rays and electrons cannot.\n\n\nThey can also be subjected to different conditions and studied.\n\n\nThe major drawback is the high cost of neutron scattering. \n\n \n\nThough the technique was devised four decades ago, the basic\nprinciples of neutron scattering techniques have remained the same.\n\n\nHowever, the adv,l>ent of position-sensitive detectors, computers\nand automation have combined to speed up data collection and analysis,\nwhich can be a tedious and timeconsuming process. \n\n \n\n CLIFFORD \ntryst with neutrons began in 1946, when, at the age of 31, he joined Emie\nWollan at the Oak Ridge Graphite Reactor at Tennessee, USA.\n\n\n( Though Prof  work in netron scattering is equally\nimportant, he died before being recognised by the Nobel committee, and the\nNobel Prize is not awarded posthumously. )\n\n\nShull, who comes from a modest background - - his father had a\nhardware and home repair business - - started off studying aeronautical\nengineering before switching to physics.\n\n\nHe obtained his doctorate from New York University in 1941. \n\n \n\nWollan and Shull began probing the world of atoms with neutron\nbeams, to make a fascinating  \ndiscovery - - one which is the basis of most structural studies made on\nbiological molecules today.\n\n\nThey found that scattered neutrons could pinpoint the position of\nlight atoms like hydrogen even when in the company of heavy atoms.\n\n\nMore important, they could distinguish hydrogen from deuterium,\nan element which is chemically similar to hydrogen but behaves\ndifferently.\n\n\nThis was crucial in unveiling the complex structures of biological\nmolecules; one can do so by selectively substituting hydrogen with\ndeuterium. \n\n \n\nWhy is this important ?\n\n\nBecause this technique allowed scientists for the first time to study\nthe structure of biological molelcules.\n\n\nAs a result, today scientists can use neutron beams and other\ncomplementary methods to study a number of amino acids, peptides,\nproteins, etc. \n\n \n\n other significant contribution was to use the\nfact that neutrons have magnetic properties to study magnetism in solids.\n\n\nThis method continues to be the sole technique of studying many\nstructural properties of magnetic material. \n\n \n\n BERTRAND Neville\nBrock-house joined the Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories near Ottawa,\nCanada, in the early ' 50s.\n\n\nHe got his doctorate in 1950 from the University of Toronto.\n\n\nUnlike Shull, who was interested mostly in detecting those neutrons\nwhich after scattering suffer no change in energy ( almost 95 per cent\nare of this type ) .\n\n\nBrockhouse concentrated on the meagre five per cent which exchange\nenergy with the atoms in the sample.\n\n\nProf Brock-house devised a technique for measuring the change in\nenergy of the scattered neutrons.\n\n\nHis first subject of study was aluminium, with its simple\nstructure.\n\n\nThe data he gathered helped immensely in building a mathematical\nmodel of the collective vibrations of atoms in solid materials.\n\n\nSounds remote ?\n\n\nWell, this information made waves in the electronics industry.\n\n\nAmong other things, the electronics revolution depends on it. \n\n \n\nIn fact, after devising this technique, Dr. Brockhouse turned\nhis attention to semiconduc-tors.\n\n\nInterestingly, the first study of a semiconductor, germanium,\nusing neutron scattering, was done jointly by Prof Brockhouse and Dr. P. K\nIyengar who at that time had started his research career in the Atomic Energy\nEstablishment ( now known as Bhabha Atomic Research Centre ) , and\nsubsequently became its director and the chairman of the Atomic Energy\nCommission.\n\n\nA number of other scientitsts from the Establishment visited Chalk\nRiver in the late ' 50s and early ' 60s to collaborate with Prof\nBrockhouse on his projects. \n\n \n\n THE BARC now has a\nnational facility for neutron beam research.\n\n\nThe neutron beams generated by the research reactor  Dhruva\n at BARC, and the necessary instrumentation, are now available for\nresearchers from all over the country.\n\n\nThe facility includes several neutron spectrometers, to examine\nvarious phenomena in the atomic world on different length- and\ntime-scales.\n\n\nThe small-angle neutron scattering spectrometer, for instance, is\nin great demand by polymer scientists, chemists and metallurgists.  <*>\noverlapping diamonds </*>   \n\n\n  A ray of light    \n\n \n\n N</old>EVER was so much hope vested\nin a beam of light.\n\n\nThe latest development in semi-conductor technology - - the\nsolid-state diode-pumped laser - - is expected to bring a ray of light into\nthe lives of infertile couples, especially those who have undergone many\nunsuccessful cycles of in-vitro fertilisation ( IVF). \n\n \n\nThe diode laser is formed from the minute chip of gallium\narsenide semiconductor material.\n\n\nIt converts electricity into laser light with no mirrors.\n\n\nLilavati hospital in Mumbai has incorported this new laser technology\nin their infertility unit to enhance the success rate of IVF.\n\n\nJaslok hospital will have it soon. \n\n \n\n \" Lasters have added a new dimension to the advanced\ntreatment of infertility\"  , says Dr Firuza Parikh, director of the\ndepartment of infertility management and assisted reproduction at the\nJaslok hospital.\n\n\n \" For women who are over the age of 35 undergoing IVF and\nassisted hatching, in procedures such as micromanipulation and in fields\nsuch as pre-implantation genetics, the diode laser beam will be most\nadvantageous.\"  \n\n \n\nThe laser beam is released from an attachment to the microscope\non which micromanipulation is performed.\n\n\nIt may be recalled that micromanipulation allows the reproduction\nbiologist to do several procedures, including injecting a single sperm\ninto a single egg under the microscope using a fine glass needle ( a\nprocedure called ICSI or Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection ) or even make a\nhole in the zona or outer protective shell of the human ovum ( egg ) to\nhelp the embryo hatch out. \n\n \n\n \" In assisted hatching, I expect the laser to be most\nuseful,\"  says Dr Parikh, who pioneered mechanical assisted hatching\nin the country three years ago.\n\n\n \" Currently, in assisted hatching - - used especially for\nwomen over the age of 35 who have a thick zona which prevents the natural\nhatching of the embryo - - we use a pipette to cut through the zona making an\nopening of 25-30 microns.\"  \n\n \n\nBut the laser beam does away with mechanical zona drilling   and\nonce directed at the zona makes a quick, precise opening of two to 30 microns\n( 20 to 250 times thinner than human hair ) in it.\n\n\n \"  definitely swifter and more advantageous to\nuse as it is non-invasive and minimises damage to the zona,\"  says\nDr Hrishikesh Pai, infertility consultant at Lilavati hospital.\n\n\n \"  another way to better the pregnancy rates in\nolder women over 38.\n\n\nI expect it to improve from the current rate of 10-14 per cent to\nabout 25 per cent.\"  \n\n \n\n \" Though this method is best suited for women over 35\nyears, especially those who have tried IVF previously, it can also be\nextended for patients undergoing IVF for the first time to improve their\nchances,\"  says Dr Parikh.\n\n\n \" While mechanical zona drilling may distort the cell,\nlaser assisted hatching simplifies the entire procedure which is completed\nin 10 tp 30 milliseconds.\"  \n\n \n\nThe laser beam can also be used in ICSI when the sperm tail has\nto be immobilised prior to microinjection of the sperm into the oocyte ( egg ) .\n\n\nInstead of the current procedure of cutting off the tails with ICSI\npipette, a single directed laser beam is shot on the sperm tail\nimmediately immobilising it.\n\n\n \" The laser beam being precise, there is very little damage\nto the sperm   and\nthe procedure will improve fertilisation and pregnancy rates with ICSI,\"\n says Dr Parikh. \n\n \n\nThe diode laser will also revolutionise the field of\npre-implantation genetics.\n\n\nUsually the zona is dissolved with acid tyrode and a cell is\naspirated out for detection of single gene defects by either the FISH (\nFluorescent In Situ Hybridisation) or PCR ( Polymerase Chain Reaction).\n\n\n \" Laser will facilitate the removal of a single cell from an\nembryo so that it can be subjected to genetic tests,\"  says Dr Pai.\n\n\nThese may be required in older women and in couples who themselves\nhave or are carriers of genetic diseases.\n\n\nAgain the laser makes the procedures swift and minimises damage to\nthe embryo which could occur with manual aspiration of the cell. \n\n \n\n \" Laser must not be looked upon as an end in itself but\nit opens up more avenues for experimentation,\"  says Dr Parikh.\n\n\n \" It may eventually limit the IVF cycles needed and enhance\npregnancy rates.\"  \n\n \n\nLasers already have various applications in medicine -

{"text": "<*> line up to right\nmargin</*> \n\n\n  Public Financial Institutions and Control   <*>\nline from left to right</*> \n\n\nRAHUL CHITNIS, Advocate, Bombay.   \n\n \n\n  IN   the nineteenth century,\nentrepreneurs owned and managed the business of companies.\n\n\nBut, with the growth of modern companies, there has come about a\nseparation of ownership and control.\n\n\nThere has been a shift of power, from those who own, to those who\ncontrol and manage the modern companies.\n\n\nThis divergence of ownership and control has led to a divergence of\ninterest.\n\n\nNow-a-days, a shareholder is more interested in the income and capital\nappreciation of his investment, rather than the company as an enterprise.\n  \n\n\nThese observations have been made in the English context, but are true\neven in the Indian context. \n\n \n\nThe growth of institutional investment is a major factor in this\nprocess of separation.\n\n\nThe financial institutions are not usually skilled in the management\nnor even necessarily interested in the detailed operations of the companies\nin which they have invested.\n\n\nThis has, in turn, led to a shift of power, from those who own, to\nthose who control the companies.   \n\n \n\nThe term  ` financial institutions'  has not been\ndefined in the Companies Act, 1956.\n\n\nHere, it may be relevant to look at the definition of financial\ninstitutions in the United States of America.\n\n\nThe Uniform Probate Code, paragraph 6-101(3) defines financial\ninstitutions as:  \" any organisation authorised to do business under\nstate or federal laws relating to financial institutions, including, without\nlimitation, banks and trust companies, savings banks, building and loan\nassociations, savings and loan companies or associations, and credit\nunions.\"     \n\n \n\nThe Companies ( Amendment ) Act, 1974 has introduced the concept\nof  ` public financial institutions'  into the Companies Act,\n1956, vide section 4 A.\n\n\nSection 4A ( I ) names the various financial institutions that were\nto be regarded as public financial institutions and section 4A ( 2 ) states\nthat the Central Government may notify any other institution to be a public\nfinancial institution, but such an institution must have been established or\nconstituted by or under any Act of Parliament or that not less than 51 per\ncent of the paid-up share capital of such an institution should be held or\ncontrolled by the Central Government.\n\n\nThe Central Government has, from time to time, notified various\ninstitutions that are public financial institutions. \n\n\n  WHAT IS CONTROL ?  \n\n \n\nThe control of a company is a difficult concept to define as a\nmatter of law, but essentially, it denotes the relationship which exists when\nan individual or a group of individuals who are clearly identifiable in some\nrespect or respects and who may themselves be incorporated exercise powers of\ndirection and dominance over the affairs of a company.\n\n\nIt is not easy to locate control in a corporation as there is no set\nrule for determining control.\n\n\nAn individual Corporation may be related to other corporations,\nbanks, financial institutions, etc.  via  complex patterns of\nshareholdings, interlocking directorships, etc. and so a case-by-case\napproach is necessary.     <*> line through\ncolumn</*>\n\n \n\nControl is defined in the draft United States Federal Securities\nCode, section 202, as follows:  \" control means power, directly or\nindirectly to exercise controlling influence over management or policies of a\ncompany or the activities of a natural person, either alone or pursuant to an\narrangement or understanding with one or more other persons whether through\nthe ownership of voting securities, through one or more intermediary persons,\nby contract or otherwise.\"  \n\n \n\n\" Berle and Means \" were the first to trace the\ndevelopment of the concept of control.\n\n\nIn their book  \" The Modern Corporation \" \nand  \" Private Property, \"  they identified\ndifferent species of control in the modern company, which were: \n\n\n  1. Control through complete ownership  \n\n \n\nThis was a straightforward category which resembled the position\nin private companies in which a single individual or small group of\nassociates own all or practically all the shares in the company.\n\n\nIn such case, the ownership and control are in the same hands. \n\n\n  2. Majority control  \n\n \n\nThis is the first step in separation oF ownership and control.\n\n\nIt consists of ownership of majority of the  issued\nshares.\n\n\nThis brings in virtually all the legal powers of control. \n\n\n  3. Control through legal devices  \n\n \n\nThis category is more common in the United States than to the\nCommon wealth.\n\n\nIt was the practice of voting trusts and shareholder agreements and\npyramiding.\n\n\nPyramiding involves the owning of stock of one company which in turn,\nholds stock in another. \n\n\n  4 ( a). Minority control  \n\n \n\nThis category of control exists when individual small groups hold\nsufficient interest to be in a position to dominate a company through share\ninterest.\n\n\nThe large the company, the easier it is to have minority control, but\neverything depends on the situation in a particular company. \n\n\n  4 ( b). Management control  \n\n \n\nThis category is characterised by shares initially being so\nwidely distributed that no individual or small group has even a minority\ninterest to dominate the affairs of the company. \n\n \n\nToday, in India, the largest shareholders in the public limited\ncompanies tend to be the public financial institutions.\n\n\nIt is then difficult to determine whether there is management control\nor minority control or negative control vested in the hands of these\nfinancial institutions. \n\n \n\nDo the public financial institutions have control?\n\n\nIn a sense, the rise of the investor reproduces something with which\nthe law has had to deal ever since the advent of the modern company: the\nconcentration of power in the hands of one or more shareholders.\n\n\nThis affords to the controlling shareholder the  power to influence the dividend policy and in many cases, the management\nof the whole company.\n\n\nThere is also a power to influence management through threats to sell\nshareholdings or to work against management can be made to tow the line of\nthe public financial institutions.\n\n\nThe financial institutions can be said to be just another example of\na power bloc within a company.    \n\n \n\nIn India, the public financial institutions are major\nshareholders in public limited companies, but do they have  ` control'\n over these companies ?\n\n\nThis question can be answered by looking at two major acts, which a\npublic financial institution could perform, by virtue of its majority\nshareholding. \n\n\n  ACTS OPPRESSIVE TO THE MINORITY  \n\n \n\nIn  \" Nagappa Chettiar v. Madras Race Club,\n\"     the court ruled that the rule laid\ndown in  \" Foss v. Harbottle \"   \n , along with its exceptions, held good in India courts.\n\n\nThe rule is that the company is the right person to sue and that it\nis not open to the individual members to assume to themselves the right of\nsuing in the name of the company, except where the transaction is illegal;\nwhere the transaction requires the sanction of a special majority; where the\ntransaction infringes the personal rights of the shareholders; and where the\ntransaction amounts to a fraud on the minority.\n\n\nBut, the company can only act through the board of directors and they\nmay well be the wrong-doers.\n\n\nThey may, therefore, decide not to sue a decision approved by the\ncompany in the general meeting, where the wrong-doers control the majority of\nvotes.\n\n\nThe outcome would be that the wrong doers would go unpunished and\nminority shareholders would be at the mercy of the majority who could loot\nthe company.\n\n\nIn such a case, control exists because the wrong-doers have a\nmajority of votes and have actually approved the fraud.\n\n\nFurther, if in this case, the minority shareholders brought an action\nand were able to show that the defendants, by any means of manipulation of\ntheir position in the company, were able to ensure that no action was\nbrought, it would clearly go to show that the defendants were in control.\n\n\n \n\nIn  \" Prudential Assurance Company Limited v. Newman\nIndustries Limited \" ( No. 2)     , it\nwas held that while the plaintiff in an action for wrong done to the company\nis normally the company itself, in exceptional circumstances a minority\nshareholder may bring a derivative action on behalf of the company where the\nwrong done to the company is a fraud and the wrong-doers are in majority,\nthereby preventing the company from suing. \n\n \n\nEven if an exception can be successfully invoked, a number of\ndifficulties beset the path of the shareholder who decides to pursue an\naction against the alleged wrong doers. \n\n \n\nThe transactions are often of a complicated nature and so it is\ndifficult to establish what the transaction involves and who the\nbeneficiaries are.\n\n\nA large amount of money is also required to pursue an action of such\na nature.    \n\n \n\nThe better non-statutory option open to an aggrieved shareholder\nin such a case is to withdraw his investment from the company by selling his\nshares.\n\n\nThe statutory alternatives open to an aggrieved shareholder include\npetitioning the Company Law Board under section 397 or 398. \n\n\nSection 397 provides,  \" any members of a company who\ncomplains that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner\nprejudicial to public interest or in a manner oppressive to any member or\nmembers ( including any one or more of themselves) may apply to the Company\nLaw Board for an order under this section <*> dotted line</*>\" \n\n \n\nSection 397 ( 2) lays down that in order grant relief under this\nsection, there should be facts to justify the making of a winding up order.\n\n\n \n\nThe aggrieved shareholder can also proceed under section 398.\n\n\nIn order to grant relief under this section, it is not necessary to\nshow that there are facts which justify the making of a winding up order.\n\n\nIt is enough if the affairs of the company are being conducted in a\nmanner prejudicial to the interests of the company or to public interest.\n\n\n \n\nThe  ` words in a manner prejudicial to public interest'\n were inserted in sections 397, 398 and 408 by the Companies (\nAmendment ) Act, 1963.\n\n\nThis enables the Central Government to move the Company Law Board\nunder these sections,  \"  suo motu  \"\n,  on grounds of public interest. \n\n \n\nIn  \" State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh \"\n    Mahajan CJ, opined:  \" the expression\n[ public interest] is not capable of precise definition and has not a rigid\nmeaning, and is elastic and takes its colours from the statute in which it\noccurs, the concept varying with the time and state of society and its needs.\n\n\nThus, what is  ` public interest'  today may not be so\nconsidered a decade later.\n\n\nIn any case, the expression cannot be considered in vacuo but must be\ndecided on the facts and circumstances.\"  \n\n \n\nThe concept of  ` public interest'  takes the\ncompany outside the conventional sphere of being a concern in which the\nshareholders alone are interested.\n\n\nIt emphasizes the idea that the company functions for the general\nwelfare of the community    . \n\n \n\nIn practice, it is difficult to sustain an application on the\nground that the affairs of a company are conducted in a manner prejudicial to\npublic interest because, conducting the affairs in such a manner cannot be a\njust an equitable ground for winding up of the company unless the affairs of\nthe company should be considered illegal or opposed to public policy \n  . \n\n\n  DISMISSAL OF DIRECTORS  \n\n \n\nThe day-to-day control of the business of a company is in the\nhands of directors.\n\n\nAs a matter of company law, shareholders cannot intervene in the\nmanagement of the  affairs. \n\n \n\nSection 284 ( 1), however, provides that the shareholders may, by\nordinary resolution, remove a director ( not being a director appointed by\nthe Central Government in pursuance of section 408 ) from office.\n\n\nUnder section 284 ( 2), special notice has to be given of any such\nresolution.\n\n\nSection 284(3) provides that the company must supply a copy of the\nresolution to the concerned  director, who is\nentitled to be heard at the meeting.\n\n\nFurther section 284 ( 4) provides that he may require the company to\ncirculate, to shareholders, any representation he makes.\n\n\nThis elaborate procedure is laid down to prevent a director from\nbeing deprived of an office of profit without having had an opportunity of\nbeing heard. \n\n \n\nTherefore, even if the shareholders act malafide or out of spite\nagainst a particular director, there is no basis in Indian Company Law for an\ninjunction restraining the company from giving effect to the resolution,\nprovided only, that requirements of the aforesaid section have been met. \n\n \n\nA dismissed director could petition under section 433 ( f), for\nwinding up of the company on just and equitable ground.\n\n\nBut, the Supreme Court has shown in  Hind Overseas ( P) Ltd v.\nRaghunat Prasad Junjhunwala     , that it is not\nin favour of such a remedy.\n\n\nHere, a private company was formed, in which an employee \" \"\nA\" \" , who had gained the confidence of the employer \" \" B\"\n\" , was taken in as managing director.\n\n\n\" \" A\" \" and his family members held about one-third\nof the shares while \" \" B\" \" and his family members held\nabout two-thirds of the shares and the direction, control and financial\nresponsibility were also in  hands.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court held that it was not a case in which the\ndissolution of partnership principle could be invoked in favour of  \"\nA\"  ( and his group of shareholders ) on the  ` just and\nequitable ground'  , as several remedies such as those under sections\n397 and 398 were open to the minority shareholders under the Companies Act,\n1956, and an application for winding up the company would be unreasonable.\n\n\n \n\nThus, a financial institution can effectively exercise control by\nremoving the directors of the company, in which it is a major shareholder.\n\n\nThe financial institution has to ensure that an ordinary resolution\nis passed authorising the removal of a director, and that the relevant\nprovisions of the Companies Act, 1956, are complied with.\n\n\nThis threat of removal could be effectively used to influence the\ndecisions of the management. \n\n\n 1.

{"text": "ORGANISATIONAL MISSION : ELUSIVE CONCEPT AND NEGLECTED\nPRACTICE   <*> six blank lines </*>  \n\n \n\nMOST ORGANISATIONS in this country do not have a mission; in fact,\nthey are too disorganised to have it; at the same time, it is obvious that\norganisation can derive very substantial benefit from developing a mission\naround which it should set its operational goals and functional strategy.\n\n\nEven so, it is the general practice that enterprises here do not pay\nany attention to this significant subject. \n\n \n\nFor most organisations, the word \" mission \" has\na very restrictive connotation, i.e., a narrow meaning associated with\njust definiting the    business   that the\norganisation is in.\n\n\nBut that hardly reflects the correct position or the whole truth.\n\n\nIn a broader sense, the term must include the purpose, strategy,\nvision, values and behaviours that make up the  unique\npersonality. \n\n\n DEFINING MISSION \n\n \n\nMission, in short, must define the following: \n\n \n\n ( a)  A Purpose  : \n\n\nThe reason why an organisation exists; its basic rationale, its\nfocus, its orientation, and its stake. \n\n \n\nExamples:\n\n\nCertain enterprises set their antena towards shareholders; some\nothers to customers; some, again, dedicate themselves to employees; still\nothers to the suppliers, etc.\n\n\nChoice of a specific purpose  <-> involves' <->  involves \n resolving competing claims of  very many\nstakeholders.\n\n\nBecause of this, several times there is a confusion and consequent\ndiffusion of purpose. \n\n \n\nSuccessful organisations must rise above the interests of any one\nstakeholder, for developing a purpose which is at a higher level and  can be recognised to be an  ` end'  in\nitself, quite independent of - - in fact, transcending - - each such\nparticularistic objective.\n\n\nBy thus creating a purpose greater than that of any one\nstakeholder, an organisation avoids competing claims, tension and conflict\namongst various interest-groups, and achieves the loyalty and support of all.\n\n\n \n\n( b)   A Strategy:  \n\n\nDefinition of the business or the activity-charter of the enterprise,\nthe lines of action-programmes that the organisation wishes to follow.\n\n\nStrategy must support the purpose and, in that sense, goes to\neffectuate the basic objective.\n\n\nIt must, apart from the long-term tactics of goal-realisation,\nalso cover critical standards and behaviour of the management and employees.\n\n\n \n\n( c)   System of Values:  \n\n\nThe beliefs that characterise  management\nsystem, its relationship to employees and other stakeholders and, last but\nnot the least, its ethics.\n\n\nThe value system resonate with strategy and reinforce the purpose,\nbesides furnishing a necessary, indeed essential, link between purpose and\nbehavioural styles.\n\n\nWithout values, maintenance may be possible but not sustenance into\nlong-term future.\n\n\nValues are barometers, indicating that behaviour, action,\nresponse, etc., are not only good as strategy but also good in themselves in\nthe sense \" that is the right way to behave, that is the right\nethical conduct, unconnected with the transient or exigent contingencies\n\" . \n\n \n\n( d)   Standards and behaviours:  \n\n \n\nRepresenting the relevant and befitting normal framework within\nwhich enterprise actions, inter- and intra-relations, behavioural patterns\nand norms are framed.\n\n\nThey reflect a code which is central to the \nphilosophy, ideology and idiom, merging both the strategy and values. \n\n \n\nA strong mission exists when the links between behaviour\nstrategy, values and purposes are not only transparent to all concerned but\nreinforcingly established and maintained.\n\n\nAnd without a mission, the organisation is without a soul and motive\nforce.\n\n\nMission, then, provides both head and heart to the flesh and blood\nand anatomical structure of the organisation. \n\n\n  Significance of Mission  \n\n \n\nPsychologists and ( organisation) behaviourists have recognised,\nbeyond doubt, that people at all levels search for meaning in life, including\nworking life, though the quality and character of meaning may be different to\ndifferent strata of people.\n\n\nIf an organisation can give this meaning to the men at work, on top\nof and in addition to, pay and other conditions of service, that will inspire\ngreater involvement, commitment and    loyalty \n in them.\n\n\nPeople obviously are better motivated and work with single-minded\ndedication and devotion, if they believe in what they are asked to do and are\nrequired to do what they believe in, within the overall framework of  holistic belief.\n\n\nThis, in turn, signifies that there is a fusion of mission of the\norganisation, on the one hand, and  , on the other.\n\n\nThis linkage, this marriage between enterprise-values and\nindividual-values, impinging on mutual behaviour and action, provides the\nmost enduring and purposeful driving force for productivity, progress and\ndynamic future.  \n\n \n\nThat a sense of mission arising out of harmonisation of meanings,\nstrategies and values can be self-motivating and equally productive is\nself-evident in the case of religious organisations, charities, Boy\nScouts, and even political parties with clearest ideologies.\n\n\nMotivation and commitment may, no doubt, come from, being the\nbye-product of strategies, excitement of achievement, honour of being the\nbest, thrill of award-winning, recognition, and self-actualisation but\nthey all are sustained through internalisation of an organisational mission.\n\n\nCommercial organisations are, however, hard on inculcating that\n ` spirit'  of values and hence, often lack in mission.\n\n\nOn a limited scale and shorter time-horizon, they succeed through\nother short-term strategies and monetary-cum-material methodologies.\n\n\nStrategies, like better decision-making, clearer communication,\ngreater delegation, humaner management-styles, etc., do equally give good\nscores but a mission, hightened by values, can bring additional lasting\nbenefits. \n\n\n  Advantages of Mission  \n\n \n\nRegarding advantages of having a mission in organisation, apart\nfrom ensuring loyalty and commitment of the management and employees, it\nalso generates greater cooperation and trust, mutual respect, spirit of\nworking together, besides serving holistic interests.\n\n\nConsensual decision-making strengthens the will of collaborative\nimplementation of programmes and makes the task of goal realisation easier.\n\n\nSense of mission is a great facilitator of selection and development\nof people through a search for likemindedness and constitutes, thus, an\nintegrating factor.\n\n\nThe point for caution is that this mission must not be woven around\nwrong or inappropriate values or misdirected beliefs which then can be\nself-destructive.\n\n\nToo much of ossified mission can sometimes lead to a kind of\norganisational thrombosis, making change difficult and reforms impossible.\n\n\nVitality of thinking and organisation versatility become in such\ncircumstances an instant casualty by sacrificing flexibility of action and\nbehavioural response. \n\n\n GENERATING CREATIVE MISSION \n\n \n\nHow to generate such a creative mission?\n\n\nThere obviously cannot be one unique way, nor is it amenable to any\neasy formulation.\n\n\nBasically, there have to be at least two tasks required to create a\nsense of mission.\n\n\nThe first is the intellectual or conceptual exercise of defining the\npurpose, developing strategies and values, reinforcing each other, and\nidentifying standards and behaviours that are the manifestations of mission.\n\n\nThe second is the communication and the management task of making the\nmission come alive in the organisation.\n\n\nIt has to be perceived and appreciated that culture is a function of\ncultivation and internalisation, assimilation and systemisation which may\noften require long years of fertilisation and efforts at synthesisation; it\nis certainly not an exercise in superficial or supercilious adoption of\nuncommitted type.  \n\n \n\nIt is in this sense that a  \" culture audit\"  is\noften a first step to developing values.\n\n\nAnd, of course, ultimately  \" a corporate identity programme\"\n is a must for symbolising the mission.\n\n\nThe particular method to be chosen must be tailored to the corporate\nambience, outer interactive environment, personalities of the top management\ngroup and other dominant realities as well as dormant traits of the\norganisation. \n\n\n  Charisma and Mission  \n\n \n\nOften times, such missions grow and develop around the charisma\nof the founder or a leader of an enterprise, whose personality, vision,\nbehavioural styles, and pursued corporate policies govern the basic\nparameters of the mission.\n\n\nA deep sense of integrative instincts emerge amongst all the people\nin the organisation if the well-communicated messages emanating from such a\ntop visionary, can have strategic, i.e., operational as well as fundamental,\nvalue connections. \n\n \n\nQuite apart from the charismatic or instinctive build-up, there\nis also intellectual approach under which senior management works out a\nmission - - a statement which guides the corporate affairs, besides strategic\nconduct of business.\n\n\nThis statement is the result of multilevel consultation within the\norganisation ( though concensus is well-nigh impossible and hence it is\noften a compromise) and, as a document ( written out and published), it is\ngenerally used as a  \" centre piece\"  of major policy frame,\ncommunication network and referral point of corporate identity programme.\n\n\n\n  Image Building  \n\n \n\nSometimes, a purely operational approach is also adopted.\n\n\nOrganisations pick up one or two pragmatic, functional themes which,\nthough related to their basic purpose, have some glamour,  `\nsex-appeal'  ( so to speak), and consensual acceptability on a\nwider scale.\n\n\nThey represent a kind of capsulised slogans, attractively articulated\nand professionally packaged, which click with the customers, give some\ndirectional push to work-force, impart some competitive edge to the\norganisation in relation to others.\n\n\nEnterprises must, however, take precaution about routinisation of\nthese  ` instant formulae'  and see to it that the external\nshine does not wear off too soon!\n\n\nImportantly, the people in the organisation are to be made to feel\nthat crucial management mean them as part of their own and organisational\nvalue sytem, and are honest about them, linking them with deeper mission, and\ndo not use them as a handy tool or a mere advertising copy for image-building\nand an exercise in marketing novelty.\n\n\nIn the latter event, it may degenerate into cynicism and\ndisillusionment, which may be counter-productive in the long run. \n\n\n  Components of Mission Success  \n\n\nSome of the conditions for  success are: - -\nFuturistic vision, - - Value consensus,  - -\nEffective communication, - - Leadership continuity, - - Top-team visibility,\n- - Programme implementability, - - Dynamic personality, - - Adoptive ( and\nadaptive) sincerity, - - Vigorous propagation, and - - Proper timing.\n\n \n\nSince action is a better and more potent communicator than words,\nthe mission must have to be implementation-worthy at all levels; the top\nteam, the leaders must prove its value and validity by action rather than\nempty talk or lecture, and personalised involvement.\n\n\nThe organisational managers must not only believe but be seen to\nbelieve in the reality and utility, productivity and profitability of such\nmissions.\n\n\nMissions come alive when the leaders try them out themselves and not\nwhen they deliver speeches or send messages.\n\n\nLack of consistency in regard to content, too much of strategic\ninstability at the leadership level, too much variance in management styles\nor flexibility of programmes to envision the mission may act to its grave\ndetriment.\n\n\nMission without internal justice and fairplay, integrity and\ndiscipline is bound to fail, whereas value, culture and character give\nvalidity to it and, who does not know, they are the best guarantees of\nsuccess, progress and prosperity.\n\n\nHuman organisations cannot do without them. \n\n\n CRITIQUE ON INDIAN ORGANISATIONS \n\n \n\nUnfortunately, Indian organisations fail on almost all these\nrequisite indices and have not particularly been careful in giving\nthemselves the glory of being  ` mission-motivated' \nenterprises.\n\n\nIn fact, the crucial mission-factor has been missing from the  organisational management scenario.\n\n\nIt is a pity that this vital ingredient of sustained growth and that\nof prospect of prosperity for any organised endeavour has been neglected.\n\n\nOrganisations do come up - - at least when they are set up - - with\nsome handy set of objectives as  \" objects and reasons\"  ,\nsome  \" overalls of goals\"  as rationale for creation of the\norganisation, some  \" agenda of action\"  as their basic\nfunctional charter.\n\n\nBut these are not to be confused with the  ` mission' \nwhich has as much deeper, much more intrinsic significance in relation to  survival, growth and futuristic progress.\n\n\nMission, being different and distinct from maintenance, has to be\nrelated to the soul, the spirit, the totality of ethological character and\noperational culture of an organisation, and it does not seem that here is\nthis country, there is much awareness of developing, far less promoting, such\nan ambience which nurtures the existential life of organisations.\n\n\nIf our organisations are poor in providing for missionary input,\nthey are bad in maintenance-output also.\n\n\nIn fact, many perceptive management-analysts and\norganisation-watchers have come to the  conclusion -\n- not perhaps without reason - - that Indians are incapable of running big\norganisations.\n\n\nIf one looks at the  ` king-size'  service,\nmanufacturing, productive or distributive enterprises, one would be aghast at\ntheir monumenttal achievement ( ! ) in the field of goal slippage, norm\ndisplacement and programme miscarriage.\n\n\nReason for it has to be sought in the singular lack of generating a\nsense of mission amongst promotors, operatives and its functionaries. \n\n\n  Lack of Competitiveness  \n\n \n\nPart of the explanation for such colosal lapse into slumber of\ninefficiency, ineffectiveness and managerial intrasigence of several of\nour large-sized organisations lies in the lack of competitiveness arising out\nof their monopolisation ( state-induced or otherwise) of the market, where\nthe clientele, i.e., the people are at the mercy of manoeuvring mercenaries\nand unmotivated managers.\n\n\nThese monopolisers are not idealiser - - they are not even\noptimisers - - with respect to input-output correlation.\n\n\nThey are wanting in ideology, ideal, a philosophy, a directive\npurpose; they lack dream, inner drive, vision and, above all, a mission.\n\n\nHow will they enthuse others when they themselves have no enthusiasms\nto transmit?\n\n\nAnd the enthusiasms is a function of an internal urge, a spirit,\nfaith, and commitment to a cause.\n\n\nOur organisation-men have lost these on the way - - perhaps they\nnever had them at the start itself.\n\n\nThat is why a lamentable mismatch is in evidence all over the\norganisational life, and its character and culture being the obvious\ncasualty. \n\n\n  Mere Gimmickry  \n\n \n\nBut there is no dearth of gimmickry.\n\n\nAttempts at manipulating the market through superficial\nsloganisation unconnected, in actuality, with the \noperative styles and performance, far removed in any case from any basic\npurpose, are much in vogue.\n\n\nFor a Department to flash   Aharnisha Sevamahe \n in the logo when, in practice, in its behaviour and day-to-day\noperation   seva   is the missing dimension ( at\nleast, that is the popular perception on the basis of experience) is, on the\nface of it, self-contradictory, and wholly unconvincing as to its profession\nof mission.\n\n\nPeople suspect not only lack of seriousness on the part of the\norganisation to translate into reality what it projects as its charter but\nmay further go to the extent of doubting the bonafides of intention and\nhonesty of purpose.\n\n\nIn such a situation, organisational credibility dips into the\nlowest, reinforced by a clientele perception of breach of faith on account of\nconstant dereliction of duty.\n\n\nSimilarly, to announce  \" For you, with you, always\" \nby an organisation which has not distinguished itself by being with you -- with\nanybody for that matter-ever, would appear a hypocritical publicity stunt\nand it often turns out to be counter-productive, destructive ( and not\npromotive) of the organisational image. \n\n\n  Dangers  \n\n \n\nThe lesson then is that unless the organisation  \nab initio   internalises a  mission\nreflective in its policy, programmes, styles, behaviour, relations,\nactions and interactions as well as other indicators turn out to be mere\nmedia copy, catchy in words but empty in substance, and cannot go far to\nretrieve the situation of a developing gap between promise and performance\nand precept and practice.\n\n\nAn organisation must prove by its action what it says or purports to\nbe doing.\n\n\nOrganisation without mission, as is the prevalent situation in\nthis country, generates antipathy, withdrawal syndrome and, at worst,\nantagonistic antibiosis!\n\n\nAn organisation proclaiming  \" We enjoy people\"  must\nnot indulge in commerical exploitation of the people who come to it but must\nredeem its pledge by service.\n\n\nOtherwise, they may writen on papers whatever they feel like but\npeople,  i.e.,  the customers do not enjoy it.\n\n\nThe slogan is not worth the paper it is written on. \n\n\n SUMMING UP \n\n \n\nIndian organisations either do not seem to believe in missions\nor, if they do, do not mean practising it.\n\n\nThey neglect the mission which, in virtual retaliation, almost\neludes them.\n\n\nAlong with it, the missing dimension on organisational life is\nthe total lack of consciousness about the seminal significance of\ngenerating a constructive and honest corporate culture which should not only\ninternalise but also enlarge, in practice, the mission.\n\n\nThe result is pathetic, if not tragic.\n\n\nTo avoid the continuing tragedy of absence of mission, what is\nneeded is a cultural commitment, concomitant corporate culture and an\nabiding faith in ideology, a vision of a man with missionary zeal, a leader\nwho is not afraid of dreaming, a combination of being a realist as well as an\nidealist.\n\n\nThat, no doubt, is a tall order but is an inescapable ingredient\nof organisational sustenance.\n\n\nMission is, indeed, the life breath of \nexistence, permeating in its ambience, and ensuring a place in the sun for\nit.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b9cc98a8-5eea-4056-9dbc-cb10839349d2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.234063+00:00"}
{"text": "Resources Management  and Waste Control\n  \n\n\n\nAVTAR K. MITTAL  <*> line from left to right</*>   \n\n \n\n\n WHEN I started my career in\nCalcutta in 1951, I was drawing a salary of Rs. 1,050 per month.\n\n\n\nWith this money I had a comfortable living.\n\n\n\nI could pay the rent of my flat which was Rs. I25 per month.\n\n\n\nI could afford a servant.\n\n\n\nI bought a secondhand car and ran it by employing a driver and\nabove all, I sent my brother to UK for higher studies by remitting him\n Rs.  400 per month.\n\n\n\nDuring the last 40 years things have changed drastically and we have\nbeen faced with unprecedented inflation which we all know has been caused by\nmany factors such as high degree of deficit financing, increased\npopulation and shortage of goods and services not matching the demand.\n\n\n\nIn other words,  ` too much money is chasing too few goods and\nservices.' \n\n\n\nOver and above all this, there is considerable waste of the\navailable resources such as men, money and materials which are not put to\noptimum use. \n\n\n\n  Impact of Inflation  \n\n \n\n\nEfforts of the various agencies both governmental and private\nincluding the National Productivity Councils did not have the desired effect\nin increasing the availability of goods and services to check inflation\nwithin a reasonable limit.\n\n\n\nToday we have to face reality.\n\n\n\nInflation is there which means heavy overrun in the  cost of various projects\nnecessitating more finances and deficit financing still further.\n\n\n\nWe have to find ways and means to beat inflation so that its\nimpact is reduced.\n\n\n\nIt will not be possible to mitigate it altogether.\n\n\n\nGovernment needs money to finance its various five-year plans and has\nto resort to heavy deficit financing year after year thus pumping Rs.\n8,000 to Rs. 10,000 crores every year in the economy of the country. \n\n \n\n\nFrom my work experience of 40 years in various industries and\nprofession, I feel that there is urgent need to control waste in various\nspheres of economy which will help reduce the impact of inflation.\n\n\n\nIn other words, we need to ensure optimum use of our resources.\n\n\n\n\n  Waste Control - - Personal Situations  \n\n \n\n\nIn the personal sphere I can cite the examples like the use of\ncar, electricity, gas etc.\n\n\n\nIt is possible to get greater value from the same quantity of petrol\nif the visits are properly planned.\n\n\n\nBefore starting, a mental planning is to be made of the various\nplaces to be visited in a row so there is no overlapping.\n\n\n\nIt is my experience that considerable amount of saving in petrol\nconsumption is possible at a time when its price is very high and also\nthere is acute shortage in the country necessitating the need for its\nconservation. \n\n \n\n\nSimilarly, there is scarcity of electricity.\n\n\n\nIf public is educated to use austerity and put off switches of\nlights, fans, air-conditioners etc., after there use, a certain amount of\nsaving is possible in electricity consumption which otherwise is in short\nsupply.\n\n\n\nWhatever electricity is thus saved can be made available for use in\nfactories, farms etc., to help increase production. \n\n \n\n\nMy experience with LPG cylinder is that in a normal household\nit can work up to 40 days with a little care, but it can finish in 20 / 22\ndays if not handled carefully.\n\n\n\nThe wastage can be controlled with a little care. \n\n \n\n\nThere can be many more instances where wastage occurs and this\nneeds to be controlled with a little effort, thus partly mitigating the\nimpact of inflation. \n\n\n\n  Waste Control - - Industrial Situations  \n\n \n\n\nDuring my 40 years of service in industry, I have come across a\nnumber of cases where industry flourished when it controlled waste and\nit went to dogs when there was no such control. \n\n\n\n  Improving Design  \n\n \n\n\nMy company used to construct pile foundations for multistoreyed\ntall and heavy buildings.\n\n\n\nThe piles were designed to carry load of 100 tonnes each.\n\n\n\nIn order to ensure that the piles did not fail after construction\nthey were tested to a load of 200 tonnes each.\n\n\n\nIt was soon discovered that the safety margin of 100 % was  unwarranted as our competitors started undercutting us by\nproviding a safety margin of 50 % only which was acceptable to the customers.\n\n\n\nUltimately, my company also decided to reduce the safety margin to\nthe extent acceptable to the customers.\n\n\n\nMy general manager who was a Scotsman used to say:  \" Why give\na Rolls Royce where Morris Minor can do.\" \n\n\n\nThe wastage was not apparent, but was in the design and if not\ncorrected in time could have put the company to heavy losses and driven it\nout of the business. \n\n \n\n\nAs much as 26,000 tonnes of steel was used in the construction of\nHowrah bridge in early 40s, but only 12,000 tonnes of steel was used in the\nconstruction of Mokameh Bridge ( now Rajender Pul ) in Bihar in 1959 which is\nnot only double decker but is four times the length of Howrah bridge.\n\n\n\nMy company finished the construction of the bridge well ahead of the\nschedule with proper planning and earned profit much more than originally\nbudgeted.\n\n\n\nSaving in steel was due to improved design. \n\n\n\n  Better Logistics  \n\n \n\n\nIt is imperative in any construction project that there is\nregular flow of materials to the works place so that the labour and plant are\nnot kept idle.\n\n\n\nAny idle labour and/or plant has always added losses to the\nbusiness. \n\n \n\n\nIn yet another case my company used to manufacture, supply and\nerect Water Treatment Plants for the private and public sector clients.\n\n\n\nIt was a practice with the company to despatch monthly whatever\nequipment was manufactured so that it could claim 90 % advance payment from\nits clients.\n\n\n\nThe erection engineer would visit the site after the last\ninstalment was despatched.\n\n\n\nOn reaching the site, he would find to his horror that half the\nequipment was not traceable at the site.\n\n\n\nThe client would not accept any responsibility for the missing\nequipment as he had placed a firm order for the complete supply of equipment\nincluding erection and guaranteed output.\n\n\n\nThis would mean that the company had to supply the missing parts for\nthe second time which would add to its costs.\n\n\n\nThe site engineer who would in the normal course have completed the\njob in a fortnight was forced to stay at the site for more than three months\nwith the result that the company instead of making profit made heavy\nlosses and also made itself liable for penalty for not completing the job in\nstipulated time.\n\n\n\nThis was the position with almost all the jobs and the management was\nworried about the mounting losses.\n\n\n\nWhen I took over the charge of the unit, I studied the problem in all\nits aspects and came to the conclusion that material would not be despatched\nto the site in piecemeal.\n\n\n\nInstead, they would be kept in the works till all the parts are\nmanufactured and then sent to site under the supervision of the engineer\nresponsible for completion.\n\n\n\nAlthough it meant a temporary loss to the company in not being able\nto claim 90 % advance payment, it was fully compensated by turning the loss\nmaking job into profit making jobs. \n\n\n\n  Be Fair and Firm  \n\n \n\n\nWhen I started my career in a professional firm in Calcutta,\none of the senior partners who was dealing with staff matters told me in the\nlift just before I was to join a commercial company;  ` Mittal, you\nwill have to deal with labour in your new assignment.\n\n\n\nBe fair and firm.' \n\n\n\nTill date I have not forgotten his advice.\n\n\n\nI had to deal with staff and labour matter in all my working life.\n\n\n\nIt was not always easy and there were many anxious moments but his\nadvice stood the test of time.\n\n\n\nIn my first job we used to undertake big construction jobs involving\nthousands of contract Iabour.\n\n\n\nEvery problem was resolved through negotiations.\n\n\n\nNot that we met all their demands but it was a process of give and\ntake.\n\n\n\nAll the projects were completed satisfactorily.\n\n\n\nIn my second job it was a large mining company and its labour\nstrength was almost 10,000.\n\n\n\nBefore I took charge of the company I was told that it was a\ndifficult posting.\n\n\n\nI was told that every year 7 to 10 deaths took place due to\ninter-union rivalry.\n\n\n\nI was in charge for 12 years and I can say with satisfaction that\nduring those 12 years, not a single working day was lost due to strike, go\nslow and / or lock-out.\n\n\n\nWhat I did was that I would call the union for discussion at the\nfirst indication of trouble and the problems were always sorted out across\nthe table. \n\n\n\n  Where there is a Will, there is a Way  \n\n \n\n\nMy company used to enter into long-term contracts of, say, 10\nyears or more duration with steel plants for supply of essential raw\nmaterials and these contracts included escalation clauses to cover\nincreases in costs that may occur during the course of the contracts due to\ncircumstances beyond the control of the company such as statutory imposition\netc.\n\n\n\nOne such increase took place when payment of Bonus Act was enacted\nin l965 and it imposed liability on employers for payment to its employees\na minimum bonus initially @ 4 % of the annual salary/wages and later on\nincreased to 8.33 % irrespective of the fact whether the employer has any\ndistributable surplus or not.\n\n\n\nWhen I took charge of the affairs of the company in 1969 I studied\nthe contracts with particular reference to the Escalation Clause and it\nbecame clear to me that the additional liability for minimum bonus was a\njustifiable claim against the steel plants.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the payment of Gratuity Act imposed liability on\nemployers for payment of gratuity to all its employees who have done service\nof five years or more at the time of their leaving the employment at the rate\nof 15 days salary / wages last drawn for each year of service.\n\n\n\nThis was applicable to all existing and future employees.\n\n\n\nIt imposed a very heavy burden on my company employing almost 10,000\nemployees which the company was finding it beyond its means to carry.\n\n\n\nI approached the Chairman of my company and told him that we had a\nclear case, according to my thinking, for passing on the additional burden\nof the payments of bonus and gratuity to the steel plants.\n\n\n\nHe dissuaded me by saying that no steel plant would ever accept\nour claim and suggested that I should rather forget about this issue.\n\n\n\nI explained to him that the situation would not be any worse by\ntaking up the matter with them as in any case we were not getting any\nreimbursement from them.\n\n\n\nHe reluctantly agreed that I might get some good legal advice before\napproaching the clients.\n\n\n\nI contacted the local lawyer whose advice was that there was a\npossibility of getting our claims admitted from the clients under the\nexisting contracts.\n\n\n\nI requested the legal advisor of the company to probe the matter\nstill further and if possible to get the expert advice from the eminent\njurist Mr. N.A. Palkhivala at Bombay.\n\n\n\nHe prepared the requisite brief, made an appointment with Mr.\nPalkhivala and we went to  \n\n\n\n  Resources Management and Waste Control    Bombay.\n\n\n\nAs Mr. Palkhivala was associated with the Tatas, he asked whether his\ninterpretation of the contract would in any way affect \" TISCO\n\" and we replied in the affirmative.\n\n\n\nThen he asked for a letter signed by the Chairman of our company\nsaying that whatever advice whether in our favour or against us would be\nbinding on us with regard to the contract with \" TlSCO \" .\n\n\n\nThe letter signed by our Chairman was duly given.\n\n\n\nAfter a few months we got his written advice and he opined in no\nuncertain terms that the payment of minimum bonus and gratuity liability were\nelements of costs and were payable by the steel plants under the terms of the\ncontract.\n\n\n\nThe Company submitted its claims supported by the legal opinion\nand we were able to mobilise  lakhs  of rupees from steel\nplant.\n\n\n\nMinimum bonus and gratuity were included as elements of cost in all\nfuture price negotiations.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0104910c-d76d-4b86-b9ae-e63940907d9b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.236011+00:00"}

{"text": "Etching time and temperature relationship for some solid state nuclear\ntrack  detectors \n\n\nR N Mukherjee & B B Baliga  Saha Institute of Nuclear\nPhysics, Bidhan Nagar, Calcutta 700 064 \n\n\nReceived 5 April 1991; revised received 5 December 1991  \n\n\n\n  1 Introduction  \n\n \n\nSince the advent of solid state nuclear track detectors (\nSSNTDs ) in the late 1950s, and the discovery in the next decade that\nplastics can record nuclear tracks  , there has been\nrapid progress in the application of these detectors in various\ndisciplines.\n\n\nThe tailored plastic CR-39 made its mark in the 1970s as an efficient\ndetector even for low-energy light particles  .\n\n\nThe remarkable discovery of Tarle  et al  .  that the addition of about 1 % DOP ( dioctyl phthalate ) to\nCR-39 monomer greatly improves its optical quality and surface smoothness\neven after prolonged etching, made CR-39 ( DOP ) detectors widely used\nin different areas.\n\n\nSince then many new plastics and their variations have been tried\nfor the suitability of recording nuclear tracks.\n\n\nRecently, a Japanese group  has\ndiscovered that a variation of CR-39 monomer with suitable additives is\nvery sensitive to low energy nuclear particles and that the sensitivity is\nas large as three times that of CR-39 ( DOP ) .\n\n\nThis latter variety, which is not yet commercially released, goes\nunder the code names SR-86 ( 10 ) , SR-86 ( 20 ) , etc.\n\n\nThere are also slight differences in the physical behaviour of CR-39\n( DOP ) detectors manufactured by different companies.\n\n\nHaving studied these differences in some of these detectors, we\ndecided to undertake a systematic study of etch track formation.\n\n\nWe present our results on CR-39 ( DOP ) ( manufactured by Pershore\nMoulding Ltd., U.K. ) , MA-ND/a ( made by ATOMKI, De-brecen, Hungary ) ,\nSR-86 ( 20 ) , and cellulose nitrate plastic detector, CN-85 ( manufactured\nby Kodak Pathe ) . \n\n \n\nThe MA-ND/a is a new type of CR-39 track detector ( allyl\ndiglycol carbonate ) .\n\n\nEtch track formation related calculations have revealed its high\nsensitivity to alpha particles  .\n\n\nAnd SR-86, which is another new type of polymeric track\ndetector as reported by FUjii  et al.  ,\nhas been obtained by introducing sulphonate groups to thermosetting resins\nwith three-dimensional network structure.\n\n\nWe have used SR-86 ( 20 ) in this present piece of work, which is a\ntest sample of copolymer of CR-39 with 20 % of diethylene glycol bis ( allyl\nsulphonate ) , i.e. DEAS.\n\n\nThe details about this detector can be obtained from Ref. 4. \n\n \n\nIn order to have a comparative study, we have included CN-85 (\nKODAK ) cellulose nitrate plastic track detector, which has been in use since\na long time.\n\n\nIt is a clear and transparent film of cellulose nitrate containing a\nsmall amount of camphor, which serves as a plasticizer.\n\n\nThis platicizer is neither attacked nor soluble in etchants (\nwhich in our case is 6.25 N NaOH )  . \n\n\n  2 Experimental Details  \n\n \n\nIn irradiating the detector foils and thereafter etching these\nsamples chemically to make them ready for scanning under an optical\nmicroscope, there are so many factors affecting these processes.\n\n\nParameters such as etching time, etch temperature, concentration of\nthe etchant to name a few, are very important.\n\n\nWe propose to establish and standardize relationships between these\nparameters which will be very useful in th etching laboratories.\n\n\nAs a first step, two parameters, etching time (  \" t\n\"  ) and etch temperature (  \" T \"\n ) have been chosen and attempts are made to establish a relationship\nfor all the four types of detectors mentioned above, which are widely used as\nnuclear particle detectors.\n\n\nFor this the effect of these two parameters on these detectors have\nbeen studied separately, and then the relationships have been established.\n\n\n \n\nThe work is divided into three parts; the first part  being the study of track diameter versus etching time\ncharacteristics, the second one being the track diameter versus etch\ntemperature studies, and the final part dealing with the results obtained\nand their verification.\n\n\nFor irradiating the detector foils a mixed source of  (\nAm, Cm, Pu ) of energy around 5 MeV ( 5.49, 5.80 and 5.16 MeV ) has been\nused. \n\n \n\nIn the histograms of frequency versus diameters of the etched\ntracks in CR-39 ( DOP ) [ Fig.1 ] one can clearly see the three peaks\ncorresponding to the major energy groiups of the alpha particles in the\nmixed source.\n\n\nThus it is advantageous to use the mixed source instead of a\nmonoenergetic source. \n\n\n  3 Results and Discussion  \n\n\n  3.1 Diameter (  \" D \"  ) versus\netching time (  \" t \"  ) characteristics \n\n\n \n\nDetector foils were irradiated with collimated alpha particles at\nnormal incidence from the above source for 6 hr.\n\n\nThe etchant used in etching these samples was 6.25 N NaOH aqueous\nsolution, all other parameters affecting the etching ( except etch\ntemperature which was different for different detectors being the same as\nreported earlier  .\n\n\nThe irradiated samples of CR-39 ( DOP ) and MA-ND a were etched at\n70<*>degree</*>C for 3 hr. of SR-86 ( 20 ) at 70<*>degree</*>C for 20 min;\nand of CN-85 ( KODAK ) at 50<*>degree</*>C for 2 hr.\n\n\nAfter drying, the samples were scanned separately under a Leitz\noptical microscope fitted with a filar micrometer eyepiece of 450 x\nmagnification.\n\n\nFor finding out the most probable diameter, the surface diameters\nof about 300 tracks have been measured to study the diameter distribution.\n\n\nThe class interval chosen for grouping the diameters measured to\nobtain histograms was 0.2 um.   \n\n \n\nThen the samples were successively etched for different times\nseparately, i.e. the etching time varied in steps without changing the\netch temperature; and at each step, after scanning most probable diameters\nwere found out.\n\n\nTypical histograms for various etching times are shown in Fig. 1.\n\n\nThe nature of variation of track diameters with etching time is shown\nin Figs 2 and 3 for all the detectors. \n\n \n\nBohus and Greaves  have shown that in\nthe case of CR-39 ( DOP ) detectors, the variation of track diameter with\netching time is non-linear for etching time below 40 min and above this\ncritical etching time and up to 80 min a simple linear relation could fit the\ndata.\n\n\nIn our studies we have etched the CR-39 ( DOP ) and MA-ND/a\ndetectors from 3 hr onwards and it is observed that the variation is\nlinear in the whole range of etching time considered for CR-39 ( DOP )\ndetectors.\n\n\nBut the data for MA-ND/a could not be fitted with a single straight\nline.\n\n\nFrom t = 3 to 6 hr the variation is linear, and after 6 hr of etching\nthis variation is still linear but with considerable increase in the\nslope.\n\n\nIn case of CN-85 ( KODAK ) detectors, this variation deviates from\nlinearity after 4.5 hr of etching.\n\n\nBut we could not proceed further to see if it behaved in the same\nmanner like MA-ND/a, because after prolonged etching, the surface\nsmoothness and the optical qualities deteriorated to such an extent that the\nmeasurement of diameter of etchpits was not accurate enough to extract any\ninformation definitely.\n\n\nIn case of SR-86 ( 20 ) the variation of track diameter with\netching time is linear up to an etching time  \" t \"\n = 60 min    (\nslope = 0.16 <*> mu</*>m/min ) and it still possesses this behaviour up to\n100 min but with a fair increase in the slope.\n\n\nThe nature of this variation is similar to that shown by Fujii  and is shown in Fig. 3.\n\n\nEtching conditions in Ref. [ 9 ] were 7N NaOH aqueous solution at\n70<*>degree</*>C. \n\n \n\nThe slopes of linear portions of the curves for all the detectors\nhave been calculated which are listed in Table 1.\n\n\nThe straight lines in each case are computer    best fits ( i.e. least square analysis has been done for each\ncurve ) . \n\n\n  3.2 Diameter versus etch temperature characteristics\n \n\n \n\nThe existence of the effect of etch temperature on response of\nCR-39 detector has been definitely established  .\n\n\nSomogyi has carried out simulation experiments with electron\nirradiated CR-39 foils, choosing both the electron dose and etch\ntemperature as the varying parameters.\n\n\nThe results thereafter show the response to be much more sensitive\nto changes in high damage densities  . \n\n \n\nOur attempt is to study the effect of change in etch temperature\nusing all the four types of detectors mentioned earlier.\n\n\nKeeping the concentration of the etchant and all other parameters\naffecting etching constant, the temperature is varied in steps, etching a\nnew, freshly irradiated sample of each detector every time separately for\na fixed time, which is different for different detectors.\n\n\nThe etching time for CR-39 ( DOP ) and MA-ND/a is 3 hr. for SR-86\n( 20 ) it is 30 min and for CN-85 KODAK it is 2 hr.\n\n\nAfter scanning the samples, the arithmetic mean value of track\ndiameters (  \" D \"  ) were plotted against etch\ntemperature (  \" T \"  ) as shown in Figs 4-6.\n\n\n \n\nIt is well-known that track diameters of charged particles grow\nnon-linearly with the etch temperature.\n\n\nThe bulk etch rate obeys the Arrhenius relation \"\nVB ( T ) = Voexp ( - - Q/kT  \" where \"\nVo \" and \" k \" are constants.\n\n\n\" Q \" is the activation energy for the bulk\netching and \" T \" is the etch temperature in degree\nKelvin.\n\n\nFor a normally incident particle,        the diameter\n\" D \" = \" 2VBt \" ( where \"\nt \" is a constant ) is not a linear function of the etch temperature\n .\n\n\nOur data have been fitted with the above relation and the fits are\nshown in Fig. 3 for CR-39 ( DOP ) , MA-ND/a and CN-85 ( KODAK ) detectors.\n\n\nThese exponential curves have been broken into two linear parts for\nall the detectors ( except SR-86 ( 20 ) ) and these are shown in Fig.4 ( our\naim is to calculate the slopes in these two regions and relate them with\ntheir respective ( dD/dt )  T slopes ) . \n\n \n\nIn the case of CR-39 ( DOP ) , the slope ( dD/dT ) ? , increases\nremarkably after 75<*>degree</*>C ( from 0.468 <*> mu</*>m/<*>degree</*>C to\n1.6 <*> mu</*>m/<*>degree</*>C ) and this is also the trend in case of\nMA-ND/a, where the slopes below and above 75<*>degree</*>C are 0.372 and 1.44\n<*> mu</*>m/<*>degree</*>C, respectively.\n\n\nWhen the etch temperature is raised beyond 80<*>degree</*>C, the\nCR-39 ( DOP ) foils start losing their transparency and the surface\nbecomes rough; but MA-ND/a foils are still beautifully smooth and\ntransparent, which suggests that one can go above 80<*>degree</*>C without\ncausing much damage to the detector.\n\n\nBut we could not go beyond 82.5<*>degree</*>C, because of the\nlimitations in our temperature bath. \n\n \n\nHowever SR-86 ( 20 ) is a bit different from others in this\nrespect.\n\n\nThe  \" D \"  versus  \" T\n\"  variation in the range 60<*>degree</*>C <*> equal to or\ngreater than</*>  \" T \" \"  <*> equal to or\ngreater than</*> </*> 73<*>degree</*>C is linear with a slope of 0.36 <*>\nmu</*>m/ <*> degree</*>C.\n\n\nIn an attempt to see if it behaves in a manner similar to the\nabove two detectors, it was observed that as we went above\n77.5<*>degree</*>C, the detector foils started losing their optical\nproperties and perceptible damage to the detector occurred.\n\n\nAt 80<*>degree</*>C it was badly damaged and the surfaces became\nirregular and the diameter of tracks were no longer circular.\n\n\nAt 82.5<*>degree</*>C this irregularity was the worst and the detector   was totally damaged.\n\n\nHowever, in the region where it possesses linearity in D versus T\nvariation, the detector foils exhibit remarkable optical clarity.\n\n\nIt is observed that this detector can be successfully used below\n77.5<*>degree</*>C. \n\n \n\nCN-85 ( KODAK ) behaved in a manner similar to CR-39 ( DOP ) and\nMA-ND/a in its response to changes in etch temperature.\n\n\nThe D versus T variation  is\nexponential in nature ( Fig.3 ) .\n\n\nAs stated in the case of CR-39 ( DOP ) and MA-ND/a, its slopes in the\ntwo regions below and above 52.5<*>degree</*>C are 0.566 and 0.8 <*>\nmu</*>m/<*>degree</*>C, respectively.\n\n\nThis could be studied up to 60<*>degree</*>C, because at higher\ntemperatures the detector foils became rough and lost their optical\nproperties. \n\n \n\nThus it is observed that each of these detectors exhibits a\ncertain type of behaviour up to a critical etch temperature, say Te,\nwhich is a characteristic of the detector.\n\n\nAnd at temperatures above Te, certain changes may be\noccurring in the material that its behaviour changes.\n\n\nThis temperature has been mentioned as critical, just to show that\nthe behaviour of the detectors changes notably and the trend of variation\nof track diameter with etch temperature starts to change sharply above this\ntemperature.\n\n\nThis Te for all the detectors are listed in Table 1. \n\n \n\nThus it is clear that only Ma-ND a is the highest temperature\nresistant among the four types of detectors.\n\n\nHowever, SR-86 ( 20 ) is the best of all, as long as it does not get\ndamaged.\n\n\nIts sensitivity to the variation of these two etch parameters is\nremarkable. \n\n\n  3.3 Relationships and their verification  \n\n \n\nThe relationship between etching time  \" t \"\n and etch temperature (  \" T \"  ) has been\nobtained as follows: \n\n\nThe negative sign indicates that  \" t \" \ndecreases with increasing  \" T \"  and vice versa\nfor constant  \" D \"  .\n\n\nHence to keep the diameter constant, if we increase the etch\ntemperature the etching time should be proportionately decreased and vice\nversa, in accordance with the above relation while keeping all other factors\naffecting etching such as concentration of the etchant, etc., unchanged.\n\n\n \n\nFrom the nature of variation of track diameter with etch\ntemperature for all the four detectors, it is seen that the variation is\nexponential in the range of etch temperature considered for each detector (\nFig. 4 ) .\n\n\nAs can be done with any exponential curve for such nature, each curve\nhas been broken into two linear parts.\n\n\nThe slopes of these two linear regions have been related with their\nrespective dD/dt )  T slopes and the relationship between etching\ntime and etch temperature has been derived and attempted for verification.\n\n\n \n\nLet us first consider CR-39 ( DOP ) .\n\n\nThe  \" D \"  versus  \" t\n\"  variation is linear in the whole range of etching time\nconsidered.\n\n\nIts slope is 2.6 <*> mu</*>m/hr.\n\n\nThe slope dD dT ) , up to 75<*>degree</*>C is 0.468 <*>\nmu</*>m/<*>degree</*>C.\n\n\nIn accordance with the relation mentioned above, ( dt/dT ) \nD= - 10.8 min/<*>degree</*>C.\n\n\nThe most probable diameter obtained after three hours of etching at\n70<*>degree</*>C is taken as the reference point ( D=5.8 <*> mu</*>m ) .\n\n\nAfter irradiating a fresh sample of the above detector for 6 hr, it\nwas etched at 75<*>degree</*>C for [ 3 hr - - ( 5 x 10.8 ) min ] 2 hr 06 min\n( since ( dt/dT )  n for this detector is - 10.8 min/<*>degree</*>C\nin the temperature range 65<*>degree</*>C <*> left arrow</*>  \" T\n\"  <*> left arrow</*> 75<*>degree</*>C, see Table 1 ) .\n\n\nScanning under the optical microscope yielded the most probable\ndiameter to be 5.8 ( <*> plus or minus</*> 0.2 ) <*> mu</*>m.\n\n\nwhich is well within the experimental error.\n\n\nAnother freshly irradiated sample was etched again at\n65<*>degree</*>C for 3 hr 54 min; and after scanning the most probable\ndiameter was found to be 5.8 ( <*> plus or minus</*>0.2 ) <*> mu</*>m.\n\n\nIn the same fashion the relations for SR-86 ( 20 ) and for CN-85\n( KODAK ) were verified in the temperature range mentioned against each of\nthem in Table 1.",

I kept in\ntouch with the EC  \nmembers through circular letters sent at least three to four\ntimes between two conferences. \n\n\nIf you can raise some funds for a seminar or symposium\nas I was able  \nto do, you can also arrange a meeting of the EC before the\nnext conference.  \n\n \n\nI am sending herewith a copy each of Newsletter No\n1 of 1992 and 1993. \n\n\nIt is better you send the newsletter early this year\nas many  \ndelegates are sending their papers to me as per my earlier\nannouncement. \n\n\nI am enclosing the following five papers together with\nletters in  \noriginal.  \n\n  \n\n\n1. Manju Jaidka 2. Mary Nyangweso 3. Sahu 4. Anjana\nAgnihotri and 5. Manuka Khanna. \n\n \n\nI would like you to know that a sum of Rs. 5395=80\nis due to me  \nfrom Treasurer on account of 1993 - 94 conference in addition\nto some dues from 1992 - 93 accounts. \n\n\nShe has of  course told me that she will\nsettle the account when she comes to Bombay next time. \n\n\nBut I thought you ought to know this fact.  \n\n \n\nIn case you need any more information, I will be\nhappy to provide the same. \n\n\nI will send you the next time the correspondence on\nOIR. \n\n\nIt is better you be fully aware of the present status.\n \n\n\nWith best regards, \n\n \n\n\nYours sincerely, sd/- P.M.KAMATH \n\n \n \n\n\n20th April, 94 \n \n\n\nTo Dr. R.K. Dhawan, J - 391 New Rajinder Nagar, New\nDelhi - 110 060. \n\n\nDear Dr. Dhawan : \n\n \n\n   Thank you   very\nmuch for your  \ncooperation during the last two years in publishing the papers\npresented  \nat the \" I A A S \" conference through your\npublishing   \n  outlet   , Prestige Books, New\nDelhi.  \n\n \n\nPlease arrange to send 20 copies of  American\nStudies in  \nIndia  which are due to me as editor and another 20\ncopies which I had  \nagreed to buy. \n\n\nI have already given one copy for review to\nMaharashtra Times. \n\n\nPlease send five copies of the book directly to our\nLibrarian for  \napproval. \n\n\nWe will buy them for the library.  \n\n \n\nPlease send a copy to Dr. Winton U. Solberg\nProfessor Emeritus of  \nHistory, Dept. of History, University of Illinois at\nUrbana-Champaign,  \n309-Gregory Hall, 810 S outh Wright Street, Urbana, I L 61801,\nunder intimation to me. \n\n\nI am also sure that you will systematically send a\ncopy each to all  \ncontributors who were not able to collect their free copy at\nLucknow.  \n\n \n\nBefore ending this letter I would like to share\nwith you two of  \nmy ideas for better organisation of publication and release of\nproceedings in future. \n\n\nI am stating this based on my experience of last \n  two   years.  \n\n \n\nFirst, we should restrict publication to only\nthose papers which  \nwere presented by the    authors \n at the  \nconference or papers which were sent for presentation but\nauthor could not  \nremain present for one reason or the other. \n\n\nThis time, you first asked  Dr. Dilip  \nMohite to give a paper and later informed me the paper\nincluded was neither  \npresented nor written for the presentation at Goa Conference. \n\n\nYou justified it on the ground that otherwise, Volume\nwould have been slim. \n\n\nAlmost a week before the conference, Dr. Sondhi called\nme    literally   at midnight\nto seek my permission for  \nthe inclusion of his paper; again one, that was neither\npresented nor meant  \nfor presentation at Goa. \n\n\nI had to say no to him. \n\n\nBoth, Dr. Sunil Sondhi and Dr. Mohite are not only\ngood weriters but  \nvery good friends of mine. \n\n\nBut should we permit our commercial interest to\noverride our academic  \nprinciples ? \n\n\nOne result of last minute addition is avoidable errors\nin the  \nintroduction such as the one where I speak of 6 papers\ndealing with  \nAmerican foreign policy while actually there are seven.  \n\n \n\nSecond, we should be more elegent with our book\nreleasing function. \n\n\nThe copies were not only not wrapped but there was\nonly one copy each of the book. \n\n\nWe should have been generous in giving a copy each to\nthe    important   dignitaries\non the dias at least those who were out-side invitees. \n\n\nThis could have been good P R work for the \" I\nA A S. \"  \n\n \n\nAny way, I hope you will take these two suggestions\nin a constructive spirit. \n\n \n\nOnce again many thanks for your cooperation during\nmy tenure as President.  \n\n\nWith best wishes, \n\n \n\n\nYours Sincerely, sd/- P.M.

{"text": "HETEROSIS, INBREEDING DEPRESSION AND COMBINING ABILITY IN\nSORGHUM ( SORGHUM BICOLOR ( L. ) MOENCH )   \n\n\nJ. N. REDDY  AND P. JOSHI    \n\n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nHeterosis, inbreeding depression and combining ability were\nstudied in a 6 x 6 diallel ( excluding reciprocals ) from F1 to\nF4 generations for grain yield and its five components in sorghum (\n sorghum bicolor ( L. ) Moench ) .\n\n\nAmong the different characters studied, highest heterosis in\nF1 over better parent ( 87. 5% ) was recorded for grain yield /\nplant followed by number of grains / panicle ( 50.1 % ) and number of\nprimaries / panicle ( 40.5 % ) .\n\n\nAll the hybrids which showed higher estimates of heterosis in\nF1 in general also exhibited high inbreeding depression in\nF2 and other segregating generations studied.\n\n\nThe general ( gca ) as well as specific combining ability ( sca )\nvariances were found significant in all the four ( F1-F4)\ngenerations for grain yield and its components studied except for number of\nprimaries / panicle in F3 and F4 and for number of\nwhorls/panicle in F2 and F3 generations.\n\n\nThe magnitude of sca variance declined in F2 and latter\ngenerations.\n\n\nThe predictability ratio showed preponderance of nonadditive genetic\nvariance for grain yield and additive genetic variance for 1000-grain weight\nin sorghum.\n\n\nThe study of F1 and F2 would be sufficient to\nassess repeatability of gca effects in advance generations.\n\n\nFour cross combinations, viz SPV 451 x SPV 474, SPV 474 x IS 508, CSV\n10 x SPV 451 and CSV 10 x SPV 474 were identified as promising, which can be\nexploited to improve grain yield in sorghum. \n\n \n\n Key words :   \" Sorghum bicolor \"\n , \" heterosis \" , \" inbreeding depression\n\" , \" combining ability \" .  \n\n \n\nMost of the studies on heterosis [ 1, 2 ] , inbreeding depression\n[ 3 ] and combining ability analysis [ 4, 5 ] in sorghum are based on\nF1 and/or F2 materials.\n\n\nFew studies have been done simultaneously on F1 and\nF2 generations [ 6, 7 ] highlighting the importance of obtaining\ncombining ability estimates over generations.\n\n\nThere is only one report on sorghum, where F1, F2\nand F3 in a 10 x 10 diallel mating system were studied\nsimultaneously [ 8].\n\n\nStudies on other autogamous crops have provided conflicting evidence\non repeatability of combining ability estimates over generations.\n\n\nThe present investigation has been, therefore, undertaken to study\nheterosis in F1 over the better parent ( BP ) , inbreeding depressin\nover three ( F2,F3   and F4)\nsegregating generations and to estimate general and specific combining\nability ( gca, sca ) from F1 to F4 generations for grain\nyield and its component characters in sorghum.  \n\n\n MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\nThe parental material involved five exotic x Indian derivatives (\nSU 104, CSV 10, CSV 11, SPV 451 and SPV 474 ) and a collection from World\nGermplasm ( IS 508 ) , Diallel crosses ( excluding reciprocals ) were\neffected with these six varieties.\n\n\nThe parents and F1-F4 generations of the crosses\nwere sown in a randomized block design with three replications at the\nresearch farm of the Rajasthan College of Agriculture, Udaipur.\n\n\nThe plant-to-plant and row-to-row distances were 15 cm and 45 cm,\nrespectively.\n\n\nIndividual plots of parents and F1s consisting of single 3 m\nlong row, while F2, F3 and F4 bulks of each cross in 3-row\nplots were planted.\n\n\nData on ten random plants in parents and F1s, and 30 plants\nin F2, F3 and F4 bulks were recorded for grain\nyield/plant and its five component characters, viz. 1000-grain weight,\ngrains/panicle, primaries/panicle, whorls/panicle, and panicle length.\n\n\nPlot means were used for statistical analysis.\n\n\nHeterosis over better parent ( BP) and inbreeding depression in\nF2, F3 and F4 generations over their preceding\ngenerations were calculated.\n\n\nThe combining ability effects and variances were estimated separately\nfor four ( F1-F4) generations according to Model 1 and\nMethod 2 of Griffing [ 9 ] .\n\n\nThe general predictability ratio was calculated as suggested by Baker\n[ 10 ] .  \n\n\n RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n\n HETEROSIS AND INBREEDING DEPRESSION \n\n \n\nAmong the different characters studied, the extent of positive\nheterosis over the better parent was highest for grain yield / plant.\n\n\nHeterosis for grain yield ranged from 7.7 to 87.5 %, the mean being\n43.9 %.\n\n\nMaximum heterosis was recorded in the cross SPV 451 x SPV 474 ( 87.5\n% ) closely followed by SPV 474 x IS 508 ( 66.2 % ) and CSV 10 x IS 508 (\n64.5 % ) .\n\n\nThese hybrids were also superior in per se performance.\n\n\nThe findings of the present investigation on the magnitude of\nheterosis for grain yield are consistent with the earlier reports [ 11-13 ]\nin sorghum. \n\n \n\nGrain yield is the final product, its expression depends on the\ncontribution of component characters and the extent of their mutual\ncancellation.\n\n\nThe present study revealed that hybrids which exhibited heterosis for\ngrain yield were not heterotic for all the characters studied.\n\n\nAmong the direct components, number of grains / panicle was\nimportant.\n\n\nThe range of heterosis for this trait was from - 5.7 to 50.1 %, the\nmean being 25.8 %.\n\n\nSecond, twelve of the thirteen heterotic hybrids for grain yield also\ndepicted heterosis for this trait.\n\n\nNandanwankar et al. [ 2] and Vashi et al. [ 14 ] also reported that\nnumber of grains / panicle was the major contributor to heterosis for grain\nyield in sorghum.\n\n\nAmong  the remaining components,\nprimaries/panicle exhibited maximum heterosis ( 40.5 % ) , followed by whorls\n/ panicle ( 30.4 % ) , panicle length ( 25.4 % ) and 1000-grain weight ( 18.6\n% ) .\n\n\nPatel et al. [ 1 ] also observed significant heterosis for these\nattributes in sorghum. \n\n \n\nOne of the characteristics of heterosis is that the increased\nvigour is confined to F1 generation.\n\n\nThere is a considerable depression from F1 to F2\nand later generations.\n\n\nIt may be seen from the present results that hybrid combinations\nwhich showed higher estimates of heterosis, in general, also exhibited high\ninbreeding depression in one or other segregating generations studied.\n\n\nIn the present study, nine out of thirteen heterotic hybrids for\ngrain yield exhibited significant inbreeding depression in F2 as\nwell as in F3 generations.\n\n\nThe magnitude of inbreeding depression varied from 3.5 to 36.3 % in\nF2 and from 12.0 to 28.1 % in F3 generation.\n\n\nSimilar variations in the magnitude of inbreeding depression for\ngrain yield of sorghum has also been recorded by Kulkarni et al. [ 3 ] and\nGoyal and Joshi [ 4 ] in F1 to F2 and F3\ngenerations. \n\n \n\nVariations in inbreeding depression in component characters from\nF1 to F2 and onwards revealed complexities in the\ninheritance of grain yield in sorghum.\n\n\nAmong the different component traits, number of grains / panicle\nshowed maximum inbreeding depression in F2 ( 31.0 % ) as well as in\nF3 ( 26.1 % ) generation.\n\n\nAs regards 1000- grain weight, not only all the heterotic crosses\nshowed significant depression, the test weight of the five nonheterotic\ncrosses also declined significantly in F2 or F3\ngenerations.\n\n\nAlmost all the heterotic crosses for number of whorls / panicle and\npanicle length depicted significant inbreeding depression in F2 or\nin one of the later segregating generations. \n\n\n COMBINING ABILITY ANALYSIS \n\n \n\nThe general as well as specific combining ability ( gca, sca )\nvariances ( Table 1 ) were significant in all the four (\nF1-F4 ) generations for grain yield and its component\ncharacters, except for number of primaries / panicle in F3 and\nF4 and for number of whorls / panicle in F2 and F3\ngenerations.\n\n\nIn self-fertilizing crops, heterozygosity is expected to decline in\nthe advanced generations and ultimately specific combining ability variance\nshould be nonsignificant.\n\n\nIn the present study, though the magnitude of sca variance declined\nin F2 and later generations for grain yield as well as other\nattributes, it still remained significant for most of the characters in all\nthe generations.\n\n\nSignificant contribution of sca variance in advance generations could\nbe due to additive x additive interaction component.\n\n\nAnother reason could be dissipation of linkages inflating the\nestimates and their likelihood of being in a more balanced phase.\n\n\nBhullar et al. [ 15] explained significant contribution of sca\nvariance in the advanced generations in wheat on the basis of evolutionary\ndivergence among the progenies of the same parental arrey, each progeny bulk\nhaving different interaction system and on the presumption of high additive x\nadditive interaction.     \n\n \n\nThe predictability ratio indicated the importance of nonadditive\ngenetic variance for grain yield and additive genetic variance for 1000-grain\nweight over generations.\n\n\nHowever, for the remaining characters preponderance of nonadditive\ngenetic variance in F1 and additive genetic variance in the\nsegregating generations was observed.\n\n\nSimilar results were reported by Goud et al. [ 16 ] and Singhania [\n17 ] for grain yield and Desai et al. [ 5 ] for 1000-grain weight from\nF1 material.\n\n\nOn the other hand, Niehaus and Pickett [ 6 ] and Govil and Murty [ 7 ]\nfrom F1 and F2 and Govil et al. [ 8 ] from simultaneous\nstudy of F1, F2 and F3 generation material\nreported importance of both additive and nonadditive components of genetic\nvariance in the inheritance of grain yield. \n\n \n\nThe magnitude and direction of combining ability effects provide\nguidelines for discriminating parents and their utilization.\n\n\nIn the present study, significant gca effects have been recorded for\nall the characters studied ( Table 2 ) .\n\n\nHowever, none of the parents studied was a good combiner for all the\nattributes.\n\n\nIn other words, the optimum level of different    attributes was not present in any of\nthe parents used.\n\n\nThe best parent identified was CSV 10, which was a good combiner for\ngrain yield and 1000- grain weight.\n\n\nNandanwankar et al. [ 12 ] also found CSV 10 ( SPV 346 ) as a god\ncombiner for grain yield. \n\n \n\nAnother parent, SPV 474, combined well for grain yield, number of\ngrains and number of primaries, but it was a poor combiner for 1000-grain\nweight.\n\n\nAmong the other parents, IS 508 was a good combiner for 1000-grain\nweight, number of primaries and panicle length, and CSV 11 for number of\ngrains, number of whorls and panicle length.\n\n\nWhile parents, SU 104 and SPV 451 were poor combiners for most of the\nattributes.\n\n\nLooking to generally similar magnitude and direction of gca effects\nover generations, it could be concluded that the estimates from F1\nand F2 generations would be sufficient to assess their repeatability\nin  advance generations, reliability of F2\nestimates being marginally better.\n\n\nSimilar observations were also made by Bhullar et al. [ 15 ] in\nwheat. \n\n \n\nThe magnitude of sca effects is of vital importance in selecting\ncross combinations with higher probability of generating desired\ntransgressive segregates, particularly when the estimates are available over\ngenerations.\n\n\nThe repeatability of sca effects of grain yield over generations was\nmuch less than for gca effects.\n\n\nThis may be due to gradual reduction in the heterotic effects for\ngrain yield from F2 onwards.\n\n\nOut of the nine crosses, which exhibited significant and positive sca\neffects in F1, only in three crosses ( SU 104 x CSV 11, SU 104 x SPV\n451 and SPV 451 x SPV 474 ) the effects were found to be significantly\npositive in all the generations studied.\n\n\nThe dissipation of sca effects in the other crosses was variable.\n\n\nThe inheritance of grain yield thus appears more complex in\ncomparison to its direct components.\n\n\nThe estimates of gca and sca effects in different crosses over\ngenerations indicated importance of additive, dominance as well as\ninteraction effects in the inheritance of grain yield in sorghum. \n\n \n\nOut of the eleven crosses with significantly positive sca effects\nfor number of grains/panicle in the F1, only two crosses ( SU 104 x\nCSV 10 and SU 104 x SPV 451 ) exhibited similar magnitude of sca effects in\nall the segregating generations studied.\n\n\nInterestingly, in a good number of crosses, the sca effects were of\nsimilar magnitude over generations for test weight.\n\n\nAmong the eight crosses, which depicted significant and positive sca\neffects in F1 set, the crosses SU 104 x CSV 10, SU 104 x CSV 11, CSV\n10 x IS 508, SPV 451 x SPV 474 and SPV 474 x IS 508 exhibited similar values\nover generations and in the cross SPV 451 x IS 508 in all generations except\nin F1.\n\n\nHigher values of gca variance in comparison to sca variance and\nsimilar magnitude to sca effects over generations revealed the important role\nof additive and additive x additive type of interaction in the inheritance of\ntest weight.\n\n\nAs regards number of primaries/panicle, of the four crosses, viz SU\n104 x IS 508, CSV 10 x SPV 451, CSV 10 x IS 508 and SPV 474 x IS 508 which\ndepicted significant and positive sca effects in F1, the same\neffects were also present in F2 set in the first two crosses. \n\n \n\nThe ANOVA for combining ability ( Table 1 ) revealed\nnonsignificant sca variance for number of whorls / panicle in the F2\nand F3 diallel set.\n\n\nOut of the fifteen crosses studied, five crosses depicted significant\nand positive sca effects for number of whorls in F1 diallel set and\nonly one cross ( CSV 10 x CSV 11 ) in F4 generation.\n\n\nThe nonsignificant estimates of sca effects in the segregating\ngenerations revealed preponderance of additive gene effects in the\ninheritance of this trait.\n\n\nAs regards panicle length, out of the six crosses showing positive\nsca effects in F1, significant positive sca effects in all other\ngenerations were recorded in only one cross, CSV 11 x SPV 474.\n\n\nThe estimates of sca effects in the segregating generations revealed\ncomplexities in the inheritance of panicle length.\n\n\nIn majority of crosses, for which sca effects were nonsignificant in\nthe F1 diallel set, the effects were significant in the segregating\ngenerations.    \n\n \n\nOn the basis of present findings ( Table 3 ) , four cross\ncombinations, viz. SPV 451 x SPV 474, SPV 474 x IS 508, CSV 10 x SPV 451 and\nCSV 10 x SPV 474, showed high BP heterosis, significant sca effects over\ngenerations, and also involved parents in the high gca for grain yield and\nsome of its components.\n\n\nSuch crosses should be exploited to develop strains with good grain\nyield in sorghum.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a801e401-6259-4111-b4e5-34eda8d32ba8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.242424+00:00"}
{"text": "CURRENT ISSUES   \n \n\n\n  Demographic status quo?   \n\n\nby ASHISH BOSE \n\n \n\n One  cannot help being tentative while commenting on\nthe provisional results of a census.\n\n\nOne must await the results of the  final  count for any\ndegree of confidence in making comments.\n\n\nInvariably, the final figures are  higher  though marginally,\nthan the provisional figures. \n\n \n\nWhile interpreting the results of a population census, one must\nobserve certain ground rules.\n\n\nTo my mind, the first such rule concerns  comparability  of\ndata at two points of time.\n\n\nIt may be recalled that there was no consensus enumeration in Assam in\n1981 because of disturbed conditions whereas the 1991 census enumeration has\nyet to take place in Jammu & Kashmir.\n\n\nThe 1981 census figure for India includes the projected population of\nAssam while the 1991 census figure for India included the projected\npopulation of Jammu & Kashmir.\n\n\nThe statistical implications of the exclusion of some states from\ncensus enumeration and the inclusion of the projected figure for some other\nstates while comparing the results of two census ( say, 1981 and 1991) have\nto be worked out before one can comment with confidence on the decadal growth\nrate of population. \n\n \n\nI believe that the 1991 census enumeration was, on the whole, a\nfairly good enumeration.\n\n\nNevertheless, I would argue that the net undercount at the 1991\ncensus would have been at least double that of the 1981 rate.\n\n\nThere are at least two reasons for this ( I) during 1981-91 there\nhas been rapid urbanisation and this tends to increase the coverage error of\nthe census ( i.e., the total count) and ( 2) the general boom in consumerism\nand the increasing dissatisfaction on the part of the vast army of 1.7\nmillion enumerators with the paltry honorarium given to them. \n\n \n\nIn other words, if in 1981, we missed roughly 20 out of 1000\npersons enumerated, in 1991, one would guess that we might have missed double\nthe number per thousand persons ( i.e., under enumeration of roughly 4 per\ncent).\n\n\nThis difference of 2 per cent itself means an addition of 17 million\nto the provisional figure of 1991 if the  higher  rate of\nunder-enumeration is taken into account.\n\n\nIn short, the  actual  population of India by this logic is\n861 million ( for comparing it with the 1981 figure of 685 million) and 878\nmillion if note is taken of the  total  under-enumeration. \n\n \n\nBut the Indian census never adjusts the data for\nunder-enumeration because it is possible to give the characteristics of\npersons who have not been counted. \n\n\n  Decadal Growth Rate  \n\n \n\nAccording to the provisional total population figure for India,\nthe growth of population during 1981-91 was 23.5 per cent, compared to 24.7\nper cent in the 1971-81 decade.\n\n\nThus, the growth rate during the last decade has only marginally\ndeclined.\n\n\nThis is certainly a reflection on our family planning programme.\n\n\nWhile interpreting statewise figures, one has to estimate the net\nmigration ( both legal and illegal before pronouncing the final) judgment.\n\n\nIn Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal, the decadal growth\nrate has gone up during 1981-91: migration must have played an important role\nin contributing to the higher growth rate.\n\n\nIn West Bengal, the continuing migration from Bangladesh adds to\nthe miseries of that state. \n\n\n  Remarkable speed in publication of provisional tables\n \n\n \n\nThe Census Commissioner, Mr A.R. Nanda and his colleagues, in\nparticular, Mr N. Rama Rao, Deputy RegistrarGeneral, deserve\ncongratulations on the successful completion of the massive census operation\nin spite of the disturbed situation in Assam and Punjab and his colleagues\nalso deserve the fullest credit for bringing out the provisional results with\nsuch remarkable speed ( they have kept up the census tradition) within\nthree weeks of completion of the revisional rounds.\n\n\nThere are not many countries in the world ( including the developed\ncountries with their advanced computers ) which can match this\nachievement. \n\n \n\nParadoxically enough, this speed was attained only because the\ndata were not fully computerised for arriving at the total population figure\nof India: hand tabulation by millions of census enumerators made this\npossible.\n\n\nAs they say in New York, often the fastest way to get to a place is\nto walk and not go in your car.\n\n\nThis is true of the Indian census also: hand tabulation is faster\nthen the electronic computers!\n\n\nBut one must hasten to add that there are limits to hand tabulation\nand it is tragic to note that, in spite of the increasing computerisation of\nIndian census table, it takes years for all tables to be published.\n\n\nIt is very frustrating for the users of census data to wait for six\nto eight years to get the detailed tables and, by that time, the data get\nobsolete and preparations are on for the next census. \n\n\n  Total population of India  \n\n \n\nAccording to the 1991 census headcount, the total population\nof India ( including the projected population of Jammu and Kashmir ) is\n843.93 million or 844 million.\n\n\nThis is certainly lower than what was generally expected.\n\n\nThe projections ranged from 844 million to 865 million.\n\n\nInterestingly enough, the Planning  standing\ncommittee of experts on population projections had revised the earlier\nestimate of 837 million to 843.6 million or roughly 844 million in 1991.\n\n\nIn short, the census count almost exactly tallies with that\nprojected figure, namely 844 million. \n\n\n  Declining sex ratio  \n\n \n\nPerhaps the most disquieting feature of the 1991 census is the\nunexpected decline in the sex ratio ( number of females per 1000 males).\n\n\nIn 1981, the government quickly claimed that the increase in the sex\nratio from 930 in 1971 to 934 in 1981 was because of the impact of the MCH (\nmother and child health) programme.\n\n\nNow we are confronted with a figure of 929, indicating  a five point decline in the last decade, a figure which is\neven lower than the figure in 1971.\n\n\nHas our MCH programme failed along with the family planning\nprogramme?\n\n\nThere is no doubt that  organisations which have\nrelentlessly campaigned for a better coverage of  work in\nthe 1991 census will be very disappointed by this dimension of census result.\n\n\n\n  Literacy rate  \n\n \n\nIn spite of the rapid increase of literates during the last\ndecade, the literacy rate continues to be low in several major states of\nIndia.\n\n\nIt is poor consolation that the number of female literates has\nincreased rapidly during the last decade when one considers the end result;\nas of 1991, the female literacy rate in India as a whole is less than 40 per\ncent and in a state like Rajasthan it is less than 21 per cent.\n\n\nThe rural/urban breakdown in not yet available but literacy rates\nwould certainly be lower in the rural area. \n\n \n\nThe six states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa,\nRajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, which comprise 51 per cent of \npopulation, account for 59 per cent of the illiterate population of India.\n\n\n \n\nIt is certainly encouraging to note the high rates of literacy (\nmale and female) in Kerala which is on the way to attaining 100 per cent\nliteracy.\n\n\nThe overall literacy rate in India in 1991 is 52 per cent for the\ntotal population; it is 64 per cent for males and 39 per cent for females.\n\n\nWhile interpreting literacy data, it is important to remember that\nthese rates do not necessarily imply that all the literate persons go to\nschool or had some schooling.\n\n\nThe 1991 census asked separate questions on school attendance and\neducational level but the results are not yet known.\n\n\nOne can be literate without having any worthwhile educational level.\n\n\nThen there is the problem of relapse into illiteracy by persons who\nwere once literate.\n\n\nLiteracy figures should therefore be interpreted with caution.\n\n\nOne cannot help observing that in spite of the literacy missions,\netc. the overall situation is appalling in India.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that the country must give highest priority to the\neradication of illiteracy in the shortest possible time. \n\n An intriguing feature of the projection exercise concerns the state of\nAssam where no census could be conducted in 1981 because of disturbed\nconditions.\n\n\nThe earlier projection for the population of Assam in 1991 was 25.0\nmillion while the revised projection ( as of 1991) put the figure as 24.8\nmillion.\n\n\nThe actual census count in 1991 revealed a figure of 22.3 million.\n\n\nCompared to the 1981 projected figure of 19.9 million for Assam, the\nrate of growth of  population would have been only 12.1 per\ncent.\n\n\nThis would have implied a high degree of under-enumeration which\nwould not have been surprising in view of the disturbed conditions there\neven in 1991.\n\n\nThe  Census  Commission, however, chose\nto rewrite demographic history by adjusting the 1981 Figures. \n\n \n\nBy this process the growth rate of Assam was jacked up to 23.6\nper cent.\n\n\nIt does appear to us that in view of the high level of\nunderenumeration in Assam in 1991, the Census Commission reworked the\ntotal population of India in 1981 and the growth rate figure for the 1981-91\ndecade of India just to show a more acceptable growth rate for Assam.\n\n\nTo our mind this problem could be avoided by adding a footnote to the\nAssam figure.\n\n\nIt may be recalled that the 1981 census did not make any adjustment\nfor the longer duration of the inter-censal period ( between 1971 and 1981\nbecause of the delay inconducting the census of 1971 by one month on\naccount of general elections). \n\n \n\nWe believe that the projected population of Assam for 1991 was\na more realistic figure than the actual count.\n\n\nIt is also not necessary to adjust the 1981 figure of Assam.\n\n\nAccording to our estimate, the 1991 population of India is roughly\n846 million ( adjusted for the under-enumeration in Assam).\n\n\nGenerally speaking, the difference between the provisional figures\nand the final figures is of the order of 2 million.\n\n\nThis will push up the total figure to 848 million.\n\n\nIt may be recalled that in 1981, the net under-enumeration was of the\norder of 1.8 per cent or roughly 2 per cent, if we assume the same degree of\nunder-enumeration, we have to add another 17 million.\n\n\nThis brings the total population to 865 million.\n\n\nAs we have already pointed out, in view of the rapid urbanisation\nduring the 1981-91 decade, the underenumeration would be higher than 2 per\ncent.\n\n\nAn additional factor was the lack of motivation on the part of the\nenumerators who grudged the paltry honorarium given to them.\n\n\nWe believe that the extent of underenumeration at the 1991 census\nwould be around four per cent.\n\n\nMy estimate of the \" correct\" population of India would be between\n870 to 880 million as of 1991. \n\n \n\nAs noted earlier, the Indian census data do not adjust for\nunderenumeration for the simple reason that, even if the total count is\nadjusted, it would not be possible to present the characteristics of the\nunder-enumerated population in regard to the table are prepared on the\nbasis of the census.\n\n\nInterestingly enough, the post enumeration check ( PEC) data in the\nIndian census do not give the statewise figures but the zonewise figures (\nbased on grouping of several states).\n\n\nThis is done in order not to expose the Directors of Census in\ndifferent states.\n\n\nBut, on statistical grounds, there is a good case for presenting PEC\ndata statewise.\n\n\nFor example, we have reason to believe that, in Bihar, there must\nhave been considerable under-enumeration and, in particular,\nunder-enumeration of females.\n\n\nIn Tamil Nadu and Bihar, the quality of the economic census\nconducted along with the houselisting operation in 1990 was so poor that\nthe Director General of the Central Statistical Organisation ( CSO) did\nnot include these states when the provisional results of the Economic Census\nwere announced. \n\n\n  Role of BIMARU states in population stabilisation \n\n\n \n\nThe 1991 census data fully confirm our prognosis that the crux of\n population problem lies in the four problem states of Bihar,\nMadhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh ( in alphabetical order, the\nacronym is BIMARU ) which account for 39 per cent of \npopulation and 42 per cent of the net addition of the population of India\nduring the 1981-91 decade.\n\n\nUP and Bihar are the most populous states of India and MP and\nRajasthan are the two largest states in terms of area.\n\n\nIn south India, Andhra Pradesh is demographically the most backward\n    state.\n\n\n population growth rate is low but this state is\ncertainly not comparable to   \ndemographically   modernised states like Punjab.\n\n\nOrissa has high levels of mortality and infant mortality, the\nnutritional levels are appalling and the segment of population below the\npoverty line high.\n\n\nOrissa deserves special attention. \n\n \n\nKerala, demographically our most modern state ( if one leaves out\nthe tiny state Goa ) had unfortunately a very high level of unemployment.\n\n\nOne is reminded of George Bernard Shaw who said:  \" There are\ntwo tragedies in life: one is not to get your  desire, and\nthe other is to get it.\" \n\n\nThe demographic modernisation of Kerala has not been matched by\neconomic growth which goes to show that harping on population growth alone\nis not enough.\n\n\nIt was migration and Gulf money which came to the rescue of Kerala to\nsome extent. \n\n \n\nFinally, it should be crystal clear that unless the BIMARU states\nprogress socially, economically and demographically, India can never be on\nthe path of population stabilisation.

{"text": "EC fiat to punish Orissa ex-Minister \n\n\n By <@AS> Ruben Banerjee {#} \n\n\n <@SR> Express News Service {#} \n\n \n\n<@PR> BHUBANESWAR {#}, <@DR> Jan. 5 {#} :\nThe Orissa Government has been directed by the Election Commission to\nprosecute former Congress(I) Minister, Mr. Muzzaffar Hussain Khan, found\n prima facie  guilty of opening fire while attempting to\ncapture a booth at Durgapalli in Bolangir on the  Lok Sabha\n poll-day in November last. \n\n \n\nIn a confidential letter ( dated January 2), sent to the Chief\nSecretary, Ramakanta Mishra, the Election Commission has further\ninstructed that action be immediately initiated against Ramesh Behera and\nSanjeev Marik, the then collector and S.P. respectively of Bolangir district,\nfor  \" breach and    dereliction  \nof official duty.\"  \n\n \n\nOn the poll-day violence at Durgapalli, Khan, till then a\nminister in J. B.  erstwhile Government, has stormed into\nthe polling booth along with his gunmen and supporters.\n\n\nIn the violence that followed, two persons were killed and several\ninjured.\n\n\nSeveral of those grievously injured had bullet injuries. \n\n \n\nThe directive of the Election Commission reached the chief  office on Friday.\n\n\nThe Commission has concurred with preliminary reports of the DIG (\nSambalpur Range), which squarely indicted Khan for violence.\n\n\nThe chief secretary has been instructed to prosecute Khan, dropped\nfrom the new Hemananda Biswal Ministry, immediately under Section 123(5),\n131, 132 and 133 of the Representation of  Act, 1951. \n\n \n\nThe Election Commission has been explicit in indicting the then\ndistrict collector and superintendent of police for their  \" dubious\"\n roles.\n\n\nEnquiry reports of the DIG, as also that by the special election \n  observer   , Mr. Sanjeev Hota, had been\nextremely critical of the  ` conduct'  of the two top\ndistrict officials. \n\n \n\nIt has been time and again alleged that Ramesh Behera and Sanjeev\nMarik had been working overtime as extensions of the Congress(I) during the\nelections.\n\n\nThe S.P. in particular had been at the receiving end of flak for the\nmanner he chased away, brandishing a revolver, the victory procession of the\nelected  Janata Dal  M.P., Balgopal Mishra.\n\n\nThe victorious M.P. had to run for his life and hide himself in a\nhouse as the S.P. threateningly searched around.\n\n\nWhile an inquiry by the revenue divisional commissioner has been\nordered into the  lathi-  charge of the victory procession, a\nprivilege notice against the S.P. has been tabled in the  Lok Sabha\n by three newly-elected  Janata Dal  M.Ps. \n\n \n\nThe Election Commission directive to prosecute the former\nminister has put the State Government in a tight spot.\n\n\nThough the enquiry reports of the DIG and the special election \n  observer   had found the former minister\nguilty, the Government so long had been going slow in proceeding against\nKhan. \n\n \n\nOver a month having lapsed since the poll-day violence, Khan has\nyet not been arrested.\n\n\nThis, despite the Orissa High Court having turned down his\nanticipatory bail plea almost a month ago. \n\n \n\nThe dithering of the Orissa Government in proceeding against\nKhan was more pronounced, given the strong observations by the High Court in\nrejecting his bail plea.\n\n\nThe court had observed that  \" it was obvious that  unauthorised presence inside the polling booth with his gunmen had\ntriggered off the violence.\" \n\n\nThe court further ruled that grant of anticipatory bail would shake\nthe faith and confidence of the people in the administration of justice.\n\n\nIt was also observed that the former  apprehension\nthat he would be arrested was not good enough a cause to grant him bail.\n\n\n \" Even a murderer in broad daylight might have apprehension\nthat he would be arrested but that did not mean that would he be given\nanticipatory bail,\"  the court ruled. \n\n \n\nThe ruling was delivered to a packed court-room on December 6,\nbut the Government refused to budge. \n\n \n\nThe directive having come however from the Election\nCommission, it is certain that Khan is neck-deep in trouble, no matter how\nsincerely the Government may try to bail him out.\n\n\nIrrespective of the outcome of prosecutions that the Government\nwould now be forced to initiate against him, Khan is sure to be denied a\nparty ticket this time at the Assembly elections, given the strictures\npassed against him.  \n\n\n\n\n Thane gangs join Dawood rivals \n\n\n By <@AS> Prabhat Sharan {#} \n\n \n\n<@PR> BOMBAY {#}, <@DR> Jan. 7 {#} : Two notorious gangs from Thane area have joined the alliance formed by\nDawood  rivals, to challenge the Dubai-based  supremacy, in the city underworld. \n\n \n\nThe recent raid on notorious gangster Arun \nbastion at Dagdi  chawl  has not deterred the Thane gangsters\nGanesh Naik alias Ganya and Ashok Bhangi, from teaming up with the alliance\ncomprising Gawli, Amar Nai, Kiran Walavalkar, Phillips Pandhre, Saundya\nand Anna Shetty ( of Ulhasnagar), Yeda Bala, Haywards and Ashwin.\n\n\nWalavalkar was recently nabbed by the CID officials during the raid\nat Dagdi  chawl  along with four others. \n\n \n\nUnderworld sources disclosed that in December last, Gopal Rajwani\nof Ulhasnagar, following the death of a notorious smuggler, Lallubhai,\nbrought about unifications amongst these splintered mobs.\n\n\nThe reason was simple: Lallubhai was the main  <-> financer <->\n financier   for Rajwani and Amar Naik.\n\n\nSoon after the murder of Lallubhai in Sun-N-Sands Hotel, Ramesh\nBhogle the main planner of Amar  activities, was shot at Sun\nMills compound, by Chotta  men.\n\n\nNaik realised that his position in Central Bombay was being\nthreatened and that his groups alone could not pose any challenge to  gang which is funded by land  , smuggling \n  financiers   and contraband distributors like\nSharad Shetty and Bhai Thakur, who have a monopoly over the landings of the\nsmuggled items, on the Vasai coast. \n\n \n\nAt the same time,  group and other anti-Dawood\ngangs also realised their limitations from the point of police contacts,\nwhich  gang    wield   .\n\n\nIt was because of this that an amalgamation took place. \n\n \n\nThe alliance soon after the formation, bumped off three of  men.\n\n\nThough these killings did not make any dent in the monolithic\nstructure of  smuggling,  havala  and\nextortion empire, it certainly shook the builders, hoteliers and bookies\nlobbies, which regularly pay protection money to the gangs which rule the\nunderworld. \n\n \n\nThe police, realising that there might be a spree of gangland\nkillings in the city, swooped on  mob and picked up\nWalavalkar and some others.\n\n\nHowever, despite the police raid, Ganya and Bhangi went ahead and\nteamed up with the alliance.\n\n\n gang recently saw a split, as his one time right\nhand, Ashok Chuadhari, has formed his own gang.\n\n\nSources said that both these gangs are the deadliest groups that\noperate in the area and their power comes more from the clout which they have\nin the police. \n\n\n Continued on page 7 \n\n\n Thane gangs join Dawood rivals \n\n\n Continued from page 1 \n\n \n\nPolice sources disclosed that gang clashes are likely to take\nplace in Dongri, Ulhasnagar, Dadar-Parel, and Chembur areas.\n\n\nThe reason being that most of  henchmen are out\non bail and those who are wanted also move in the city with a puffed up\nchests.\n\n\nRecently, Anil Parab, the gangster who had used the machine gun\nduring the killing of Asok Joshi and his goons, near Panvel, got married\nin the central part of Bombay.\n\n\nThough most of the gangsters who had taken part in the Panvel\nshoot-out had surrendered ( later released on bail), Parab had not. \n\n \n\nThe only hitch in Chotta  gang is that one of\ntheir main planners, Sadhu Shetty is still behind bars.\n\n\nSadhu Shetty was recently shifted from Nashik Jail to Nagpur Jail,\nfollowing a clash with Prakash Misal, a gangster from Worli, who is serving a\nlife sentence in Nashik Jail.\n\n\nMisal was assaulted by Sadhu  goon - - Chimay.\n\n\n \n\nChotta  group, because of the absence of Sadhu\nShetty, who used to deal with the disciplinary forces in the eastern suburbs,\nrecently shifted their headquarters from Ghatla village to Tilak Nagar, as\nthat area provides them more security, since the police there is not hostile\ntowards them.\n\n\nBoth the groups have already started arming  \n themselves   .\n\n\nWhile,  men whether from Dongri, Dadar-Parel,\nJogeshwari or Chembur, have a stock of arms along with the support of\ndisciplinary forces, the other side, recently procured two sten guns and\nfour revolvers. \n\n \n\nThe stakes are control over land in the western suburbs,\nnarcotics, gold and silver contraband, extortion and  havala \nsyndicate.\n\n\nFinally, the gang which comes out winner on the underworld\nchessboard, will also get political patronage.  \n\n\n\n\n    Olympia   make Lyngby rue lapses\n\n\n\n By <@AS> K. BHASKARAN {#}\n\n\n<@SR> The Times Of India News Service {#} \n\n\n<@PR> CALCUTTA {#}, <@DR> Jan. 12 {#}.\n\n \n\nSLIP up even a little and you will pay the price in any close\nencounter.\n\n\nThis    olympia   of Paraguay, drove\nhome to the discomfiture of Lyngby Boldklubben, of   \nDenmark   , in the group  ` A'  match of the\nJawaharlal Nehru Centenary Cup football tournament at the Salt Lake Stadium,\nhere, this evening. \n\n \n\nA poor, incomprehensible pass back by left stopper Hasse Kuhn to\nthe top of the box opened the gate for       victory.\n\n\nGoalkeeper Kim Brodersen, who had a very fine match, rushed out and\nclashed with right stopper Michael Gothenborg backing into him.\n\n\nThe ball dropped off them loose for nippy Gabriel Gonzalez to seize\nand drive home for the opening goal in the 21st minute. \n\n \n\nFive minutes from the end,    olympia\n  substitute Carlos Torres and two colleagues hustled substitute\nright back Dennis Hansen near the touchline and halfway line and the ball\nwas pushed forward for Luis Monzon to break away for the top of the Lyngby\npenalty area.\n\n\nBrodersen swiftly came out, but was beaten by a neat dribble of\nMonzon, who veered to his right and drove into the empty net for the second\ngoal. \n\n\n IN SEMI-FINALE \n\n \n\nThis 2-0 victory virtually puts    olympia\n  into the semi-finals, as although the other three teams, Lyngby,\nEast Bengal and Salgaocar all can hypothetically tally four points, all three\nare unlikely to.\n\n\n   olympia   meet East Bengal on\nSunday, the same day Lyngby also play Salgaocar.\n\n\nThose ties will make clearer the picture. \n\n \n\nLyngby saw a little more of the ball.\n\n\nBut    it   also increasingly became clear\nthat they were not creating as many openings as   \nolympia   though the Paraguayan champions had possession for\nshorter spells.\n\n\nAnd Olimpia were more menacing whenever their attack moved. \n\n \n\nSkipper and central midfielder John Helt is a gifted player.\n\n\nHis stroking of the ball with various parts of his feet,    especially   the right, to relay the ball with\nfirm and direct or curling passes saw the Danes come through from the flanks\nand occasionally through the middle.\n\n\nHe had fine support from left winger Henrik Lersen and Dennis Foss.\n\n\nBut as a team the Danes did not have the precision or skills to get\nthe better of the Libertadores Cup losing  defence.\n\n\nTheir crosses from the flanks, usually long and intended for\ncolleagues bearing in from the opposite flank into the box, were\nuncompromisingly headed away.\n\n\nLeft back Silvio Suarez caught the eye with his fine heading to clear\nthe threats away. \n\n \n\nLyngby also lacked the finesse to break through on wall passes,\ntheir efforts to use this simple move came to nought through the final pass\nbeing just a wee bit awry in weighting of it.\n\n\nThe receiver found the ball just out of his reach.\n\n\nFlemming Christen and Claus Christiansen were guilty of the slight\ninaccuracy of the passes that could have put Peter Nielsen and Klaus Berggren\non the path to an equaliser before the interval. \n\n \n\n   Olympia   were very\nprofessional.\n\n\nTheir marking was more zonal, but very clever in that they baited the\nDanes to pass and then darted in to swoop up the ball and set in motion\ncounter-attacks.\n\n\nThey were very confident in defence and the long lease their\nrivals had on the ball did not perturb them.\n\n\nIn attack they were quick and darted away from rivals drawn out of\nposition.\n\n\nIf they did not add to their tally till five minutes from the end it\nwas due to the fine goalkeeping of Brodersen, who timed his sorties well and\ncovered the angles and blocked shots at the top of the box. \n\n \n\nAfter the second goal he denied Adolfo Jara a goal that would\nhave been somewhat similar to that of Monzon. \n\n \n\nRobson Reta Moso, the    Olympia  \nmidfielder, was shown the yellow card by referee Sagar Sen for tripping Foss\nlate in the first half. \n\n \n\n   Olympia   today played with\nnumbers stitched in a square over the black bank on their shorts.\n\n\nThat made it easier for the spectators to identify them. \n\n \n\nTomorrow, Zambia will play Metallist Kharkov in what will be the\nlast match for the two in group  ` B'  .", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "87245b8e-8ab4-4e42-a84f-07b2a36827c3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.244744+00:00"}

line</*> \n\n\n\n  Girish Shastri \n\n \n\n  ATUL   did not remember exactly\nhow and when it started.\n\n\nHe remembered having a carefree, tension free life till high school.\n\n\nIt was somewhere around junior college that he started worrying too\nmuch.\n\n\nIt all began gradually, first with examinations.\n\n\nWhat if I fail?\n\n\nAll my friends will go ahead of me.\n\n\nWhat will my parents say?\n\n\nAnd my brother who has been passing all his exams effortlessly with a\nfirst class ?\n\n\nWill he tease me ?\n\n\nThese were some of the thoughts which entered his mind even before\nappearing in the exams.\n\n\nBut all his worries were however superfluous as he always passed\nwith flying colours. \n\n \n\nThe older he got, the more he worried.\n\n\nHis most patent worry was his family.\n\n\nHe always expected to find somebody dead when he returned home\nfrom outing.\n\n\nAnd if somebody failed to return by the promised time, he started\npacing the floor, not resting till the concerned person arrived. \n\n \n\nIf a group of girls were seen chattering he always thought that\nhe was the topic of their discussion.\n\n\nThey are gossiping about me, he worried, was the cigarette I smoked\nyesterday the topic of their gossip <*> dotted line</*> \n\n \n\nAnd then he took admission in a reputed engineering college.\n\n\nBeing away from his family reduced his worries at least on the home\nfront.\n\n\nNo news is good news was his new motto.\n\n\nHe found <*> dotted line </*> girl in Vaishali as his girl friend and\nthere was friend Rahul as his room mate.\n\n\nOne day  cycle was missing.\n\n\nAtul our hero, seemed worrying instantly.\n\n\nWhat if Rahul thinks that I have stolen it since only I know where\nhe keeps the keys?\n\n\nThis thought worried him till the cycle was found the next day with\nanother friend who had broken the lock and taken the cycle due to an\nemergency. \n\n \n\nOne day Atul confessed this habit of worrying unnecessarily to\nRahul and asked for his advice.\n\n\nWhy don't you maintain a diary in which you can pen down all that is\ntroubling you, Rahul asked.\n\n\nGiving vent to your worries will help you reduce them.\n\n\nAtul liked the idea of sharing his worries with someone, so what if\nit was only a diary ?\n\n\nAnd thus began a  ` heart-to-heart'  with the\ndiary. \n\n \n\nOne day, Atul fell down from the bus and hurt his knee badly.\n\n\nWhat if it gets gangrenous and needs to be amputated ?\n\n\nHe wrote what was troubling him in the diary.\n\n\nWhat happened to your leg ?\n\n\nRahul asked him the neat day and Atul narrated the whole incident to\nhim.\n\n\nWell, one of my friends had a similar accident and his leg had to be\namputated, so take care, saying this Rahul left.\n\n\nAtul felt as if the sky had fallen over his head.\n\n\nHe couldn't concentrate on anything till his leg healed. \n\n \n\nThen came their college elections.\n\n\nOn election day, a lot of crackers were burst in the  room.\n\n\nAnd lo!\n\n\nAgain began his ceaseless worries.\n\n\nThe principal is definitely going to suspect me.\n\n\nMy instinct tells me so and he was even glaring at me when he\ndiscovered the crackers.\n\n\nWhat if he accuses me ?\n\n\nWhat if I can't clear myself properly of the charges against me, he\nwill suspend me and then I'll be finished.\n\n\nHe wrote all this in his diary to lessen tension.\n\n\nNext day the principal assembled every one in the drawing hall and\nto  horror confronted him directly.\n\n\n \" Atul, I have eye witness who swear to have seen you\nbursting the crackers.\n\n\nWhat have you to say to that?\"  \n\n \n\n \" No, no,\"  he stammered and started\nperspiring.\n\n\n \" Your silence itself signifies that you are the culprit.\n\n\nBut as this is your first mistake, I am letting you go.\n\n\nTake care not to repeat such things in the future,\"  saying\nthis the principal dispersed the assembly.\n\n\nAtul was speechless.\n\n\nBut I have not done it, shouted his conscience.\n\n\nThen why did the principal single me out, he wondered. \n\n \n\nThat  college elections led to a big fight.\n\n\nAtul who was a silent spectator to all the mindless violence watched\nin horror as his colleague was brutally knifed.\n\n\nHe ran for his life.\n\n\nLater in the day he sat and shared this with his diary.\n\n\nToday I have watched something which I should not have.\n\n\nWhat if the police start questioning me and as always I get bogged\ndown by nervousness ?\n\n\nLike the college principal they will think that I have murdered\nhim.\n\n\nThen what ?\n\n\n be jailed, ruined for life.\n\n\nGod help me please, he wrote in his diary. \n\n \n\nThe next day, his worst fears were confirmed.\n\n\nThe police singled him out and took him away for questioning.\n\n\nAtul was shocked.\n\n\nWhat is happening to me, he asked himself again and again.\n\n\nBut this one time his senses worked faster than usual.\n\n\nHe answered all the questions put by the police very confidently.\n\n\nHe even consented to take the lie detector test.\n\n\nThe police were a little confused.\n\n\nThey started to confer amongst themselves.\n\n\n \" But he was very positive <*> dotted line</*>\n\n\nI really don't know how <*> ditted line</*>\"  were some of\nthe phrases Atul caught.\n\n\n \" Okay, son you may go now,\"  the police Inspector\nfinally told Atul.\n\n\nAtul thanked him profusely. \n\n \n\nAs a parting shot, he asked the Inspector as to what made them\nsuspect him.\n\n\n \" Rahul told us he had seen you and if we question you to\nthat effect, you would confess easily,\"  replied the inspector.\n\n\nThe reply hit Atul like lighting.\n\n\nWhy Rahul ?\n\n\nWhy would he falsely implicate me, thought he. \n\n \n\nThe next day was spent in pondering about  motive\nbehind the allegation.\n\n\nBut Atul just couldn't find any answer.\n\n\nHe decided to call it a day and went to bed early.\n\n\nHey buddy, not writing your diary tonight ?\n\n\nNothing to worry about I presume !\n\n\nRahul joked and went away to watch television.\n\n\nAtul smiled and was just drifting to sleep when he suddenly sat bolt\nupright as a striking thought hit him forcefully.\n\n\nWhat had Rahul said that he had not written anything in his diary\ntonight.\n\n\nHow had he known?\n\n\nUnless he was reading his diary!\n\n\nOf course !\n\n\nMany things clicked into place at once. \n\n \n\nAtul immediately felt an urge to talk to the police inspector\nwhich he did.\n\n\n \" You couldn't have come at a better time,\"  the\ninspector said.\n\n\n  \"  We already have evidence that your friend Rahul\nis behind the murder.\n\n\nWhy don't you write this down in your diary tonight,\"  he\nsaid giving Atul a piece of paper on which something was writtn.\n\n\n \" We will wait and watch after that.\" \n\n\nAs per the  instructions, Atul wrote in his\ndiary that night.\n\n\nThe knife used in the fight and the one that committed the murder\nwas mine.\n\n\nIf this information is known to the police, I am finished. \n\n \n\nAfter writing this Atul slept soundly.\n\n\nHe woke up in the morning to the news of  arrest.\n\n\nWhat happened, he asked the Inspector later.\n\n\n \" Your friend came in the morning with a hint to question\nyou about the knife.\n\n\nWe questioned him instead and he has confessed.\" \n\n\nMany puzzles fell in place for Atul.\n\n\nRahul had experimented with Atul in the  case\nand had succeeded.\n\n\nSo he had taken a bold step, committed a murder and had tried to\nimplicate him falsely. \n\n \n\n \" What now, son?\" \n\n\nThe Inspector asked.\n\n\nWell for one thing no more worrying from now on.\n\n\nI have had enough.\n\n\nI am going to take Vaishali out tonight.\n\n\nOh God ! look at the time.\n\n\n have to run.\n\n\nVaishali must be waiting for me at the theatre.\n\n\nShe is alone.\n\n\nWhat if somebody kidnaps her <*> dotted line </*>  <*> black\nsquare</*>  \n\n\n\n\n  FICTION   \n\n\n  THE GODMOTHER   \n\n\n Vishal was aghast.\n\n\nHe couldn't believe that his mother was a murderer.\n\n\nA murderer of tiny, innocent girl infants.\n\n\nBut the facts could not be ignored.\n\n\nSo, all set to arrest his own mother, he is in for another surprise\nwhen he finds out that he was mistaken.  \n\n\n  Girish Shastri \n\n \n\n  WHAT   has to be done, has to\nbe done - - the area chief inspector said to Vishal.\n\n\n \" You can't beat the facts.\n\n\nIt is all before you and now it is entirely your decision.\"\n\n\n\nVishal kept staring at the file before him.\n\n\nIt was a very hard decision to take.\n\n\nIf the facts in the file were correct and to be believed, he had to\ngo and arrest someone immediately - his own mother ! \n\n \n\nVishal was born the third son to a coal mine labourer in\nGopalpur.\n\n\nHis early days were full of poverty and misery and his father tried\nvery hard to make both ends meet somehow.\n\n\nBut the marriages of his sisters and his own studies made Vishal\nworry about their future.\n\n\nHis mother too shared his thoughts.\n\n\nSo to take care of these forthcoming cost implications,  mother took on the job of a    ` dai'\n   without Vishal or his  knowledge.\n\n\n  Dais   were abundant in this area.\n\n\nThey were basically helpers ( or midwives ) helping women during\nadvance stages of delivery and the actual delivery of children. \n\n \n\nBut behind this honourable work lay a dark secret.\n\n\nIf the new born baby was a girl child, she was immediately handed\nover to the   dai   in most cases for termination.\n\n\nSo the   dais   took on the job of killing\nfemale infants at the behest of parents on payment of a fee.\n\n\nThe killing patterns varied and were very inhumane but the fees\nremained the same.\n\n\nThe   dai   could earn anything upto \nRs.  1000 for killing a female infant but only a few hundred \nrupees  to deliver a healthy male infant.\n\n\n mother averaged about six deliveries a week and\nsoon the family prospered. \n\n \n\nAs a child, Vishal could not understand the sudden prosperity\nof his family and neither did he care.\n\n\nHe was only concerned about his studies and sports and that was\nbeing taken care of.\n\n\nBut he did observe the sudden change of attitude people began to\nhave towards his mother.\n\n\nShe commanded a new aura of respect.\n\n\nPeople close to the family started calling her  ` Godmother'\n .\n\n\n parents also started to have long and sometimes\nheated discussions late into the night.\n\n\nVishal saw small bundles of clothes being whisked away in his  autorickshaw late at nights.\n\n\nAll these things frightened Vishal and when his parents suggested\nthat he join a boarding school for brighter prospects, he readily accepted.\n\n\n \n\nVishal was a very bright student and he did very well in his\nstudies as well as sports.\n\n\nHe was so busy in these activities that it became increasingly\ndifficult for him to visit his Gopalpur house.\n\n\nBut the increasing prosperity of his family never failed to impress\nhim whenever he visited his parents.\n\n\nHe even mentioned this to his mother saying that it frightened\nhim.\n\n\nBut his mother assured him that everything was  gift\nand that she or his father were doing nothing wrong. \n\n \n\nVishal felt somewhat relieved but he never could understand the\nrespect his mother commanded or why people called her ` Godmother'.\n\n\nNobody would answer even if he asked.\n\n\nThey would only say that she was the best thing after God.\n\n\nAll this was difficult for Vishal to understand, so to make himself\nhappy, he concluded that his mother was doing a lot of social work and the\ngrateful people had given her the title. \n\n \n\nVishal passed all his exams in flying colours and passed his\nIPS exams without any trouble.\n\n\nHe was posted at a place far away from his home.\n\n\nHis job gave him many challenges and adventures and soon he    was recognised as one of the best officer in\nthe police services. \n\n \n\nOne day an old couple came searching for him and on meeting him\npromptly fell at his feet.\n\n\nThey kept on saying that they had a lot to thank his mother for.\n\n\nVishal did not understand.\n\n\nWhat were these old couple saying ?\n\n\nHe could only make out that they were talking about their daughter.\n\n\nHe could also understand that their daughter was now married and\nhappily settled.\n\n\nFinally the couple was turned out by the constables.\n\n\nVishal tried to forget the incident. \n\n \n\nThe coming year saw Vishal getting married.\n\n\nHe was always posted away from home but he had secretly resolved\nthat his wife would deliver their first baby in his hometown Gopalpur.\n\n\nSo when she became pregnant, he took a long leave and after many\nyears returned to his hometown along with her.\n\n\nWord that he had arrived spread like fire in the small town and\nmany old friends started visiting him.\n\n\nOne such friend asked him where his wife was going to deliver the\nbaby.\n\n\n \" Oh of course in the hospital,\"  said Vishal.\n\n\n \" Your mother won't deliver it ? \"  asked the friend\n \" of course not!\"  said Vishal.\n\n\n  \"  I did not even know that she delivers babies\"\n Vishal thought that this was part of his  social\nwork.\n\n\n \" Oh she does and is very famous for it,\"  said his\nfriend and parted.\n\n\nVishal forgot about the episode. \n\n \n\nThe area chief inspector met Vishal the next day.\n\n\n \" I have some urgent work,\"  he said.\n\n\n \" Sure\"  said Vishal and together they went to the\nstation.\n\n\n \" I am sorry to involve you in this but I felt I should\natleast inform you that we are to arrest your mother soon,\"  said the\npolice inspector.\n\n\n \" What?\"  said Vishal.\n\n\n \" Yes.\"  She is a   dai   .\n\n\nShe kills female infants for a fee on behest of the parents.\"\nVishal couldn't believe it.\n\n\n \" Yes\"  . said the inspector,  \" it is\nshocking.\n\n\nWe can't arrest her immediately for want of evidence.\n\n\nYou talk to her.\n\n\nAsk her where the graves or furnaces are and remember we have to\nmake the arrest, together if needed.\n\n\nWhatever has to be done has to be done.\"  \n\n \n\nVishal made his way home with a heavy heart.\n\n\nHis mother greeted him at the door.\n\n\nHe spoke to her directly,  \" Where are the graves mother?\"\n\n\n\n \" Oh, so you have heard!\" \n\n\n \" Yes I have.\n\n\nHow could you do such a horrible deed mother ?\n\n\nNow I know why people called you Godmother !\n\n\nYou helped the poor infants reach God before they lived their life.\n\n\nWhy mother? Why?\" \n\n\n \" I have nothing to say,\"  said his mother.\n\n\n \" I am arresting you.\n\n\nPlease come to the police station with me.\"  said Vishal.\n\n\n \n\n \" Just a minute son,\"   father\nsaid from the bedroom.\n\n\n \" Before you arrest her, take a look at these\nphotographs.\" \n\n\nHe handed him the album.\n\n\nInside were photographs of young ladies.\n\n\n \" Who are they?\"  asked Vishal.\n\n\n \" The female infants your mother was supposed to kill.\n\n\nThere are no graves, son.\n\n\nYour mother never killed a child.\n\n\nThe parents were always so chicken hearted that they never confirmed\nthe death of their little girl.\n\n\nYour mother was paid on her word.\n\n\nAll the children were brought here and promptly placed in some\nsocial organisations for adoption.\n\n\nIn fact you have even met one couple who were childless and had\nbenefited from your  greatness.\n\n\nStill if you feel she is a culprit, go ahead and arrest her.\"\n \n\n \n\nVishal remembered the bundle of clothes whisked away at nights.\n\n\nSo they were little girls! \n\n \n\n \" Godmother, you are great!\"  was all he could\nsay.  <*> black square</*>", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f39f037b-74e2-4f60-9eea-976999e40d51", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.245861+00:00"}

\n\n \n\n   Observation   is the\nstarting point of all the scientific methods.\n\n\nOut of curiosity the scientist observs the fact in the nature & start\nwith the scientific method. \n\n\n 2  Frequent use of Instrument  \n\n \n\n   Whenever a   scientist\nobserves the facts in the nature it is not possible to observe all the facts\ndirectly.\n\n\nSometimes scientists    take   the help\nof instrument for observation.\n\n\neg:- Thermometre, barometre, measuring scale,  \n microscope   etc., are the various instruments used in scientific\nmethod. \n\n\n 3  A problematic fact  : -

\n\n \n\nThe problematic fact is the base for the scientific method.\n\n\nWhen a    scientist   comes across\nthe problematic facts,    he   starts with\nscientific method to investigate the exact cause & effect    relationship.    \n\n\n  2 Construction of preliminary Hypothesis  : - \n\n \n\nWhen scientist faces a a problem,    he \n wants to know the the cause & the effect of problem, so he collects some\nprimary information through problematic fact.\n\n\nHe    builds   a  \n preliminary   hypothesis as    an ideal\n  idea for the problematic fact. \n\n \n\neg:- Edward Jennar faces the problem of small pox in the a\nvillage,    he   thinks over it & constructs the \n  preliminary   hypothesis to find out the\ncause of the small pox. \n\n\n  3 Collection of additional data  : - \n\n\nAt this stage additional data or information is collected by the\nscientists to draw the final generalisation. \n\n \n\neg:- Proceeding above example the scientist  \n Edward   Jennar collects extra information of problematic fact.\n\n\n\n  4 Construction of explanatory Hypothesis  : - \n\n \n\nAt this step  after taking into account all the\n    available   information \n  the scientist   draws the explanatory\nhypothesis to explain the problematic fact.  eg : -\n\n\nEdward Jennar with    available  \ninformation & imagination of his own towards the subject finds that the germs\nspreading small-pox can be used for vaccination & diagosis of small pox. \n\n\n  Generalisation  : - \n\n \n\nThis is the last of scientific method.\n\n\nAfter constructing the explanatory hypothesis the scientists draw the\ngeneralisation of the problematic fact. \n\n \n\neg:- Edward Jennar    generalised \n that the person who is    continuously \n in the contact of    germs   cannot    catch   small pox.\n\n\nHe also generalised that the chemical of    germs\n  of small-pox when injected in the body of patient of small-pox\nhe will be cured by small-pox.  \n\n \n\n \n\nHypothesis is a tentative statement or guess work to find out the\nfinal cause & effect relationship behind every natural happening.\n\n\nA Good hypothesis should be have certain qualities.  \n\n \n\n1 The scientific Hypothesis should be relative to the nature.\n\n\n relativity of  Hypothesis is\nessential for a good Hypothesis.\n\n\nBecause Hypothesis not related to the subject matter of the problem\nthe scientist    cannot   arrived at correct\ngeneralisation. \n\n \n\n2 The scientific Hypothesis should be   \ncompatible   in nature.\n\n\nA Good hypothesis should be    competitive\n  in nature against the other hypothesis constructed by the scientist\non the same    problem   . \n\n \n\n3 A good scientific hypothesis should have explanatory power.\n\n\nBecause before drawing final generalisation the scientist arrives at\nexplanatory hypothesis which should give explanation to the problem. \n\n \n\n4 A good hypothesis should focus same light on each & every\nfactor  of the  problem. \n\n \n\n5 A good hypothesis should  be  comprehensive in nature.\n\n\n \n\n6 A good hypothesis should be flexible in nature,\n   because   nature is full of uncertainities.\n\n\n \n\n7 A good hypothesis should give least  \n  result   of the problem as it selected after\ndeducting the number of hypothesis.  \n\n \n\n \n\nHypothesis is a tentative statement or a trial idea or a guess\nwork for a given problematic fact. \n\n \n\nConstruction of hypothesis is   \ncompletely   personal & individual work.\n\n\nThere is no certain rule of constructing Hypothesis.\n\n\n It  entirely   \ndepends   upon the skill of the scientists to construct the\nhypothesis.\n\n\nThe    basic   knowledge of the subject\n& imagination &    intuition      helps   the scientist to construct the  \n proper Hypothesis   \n\n \n\nRefutation of Hypos means dropping up of unsuitable Hypos &\nadopting the suitable ones. \n\n \n\nWhen scientist faces the problem he    puts\n  forward his imagination or guess work &   \nconstructs   a hypothesis to draw the   \ngeneralisaton   \n\n \n\nIt is not necessary that very 1st   \nhypothesis   will match the problem.\n\n\nThe scientist    keeps   on\nconstructing the Hypos unless he got the satisfactory result.\n\n\nHe refuses the unsuitable Hypos & construct new Hypo if that will\nalso not suitable    then   that also refuses by\nthe scientist it is known as \n\n\n Refutation of Hypothesis \n\n eg:- The    astronomer   scientist Kepler\nused refutation hypothesis while drawing generalisation about the    orbital   route of the earth.\n\n\nHe  accepted 19th Hypothesis to draw the final\ngeneralisation.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8bd4fa11-a3c0-4387-9955-dea3d04056b2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.247491+00:00"}

MANI {#}\n\n\n<@SR> The Times of India News Service {#} \n\n\n<@PR> TRIVANDRUM {#}, <@DR> Jan. 6 {#}\n\n \n\nTHE clamour for reduction of Air-  fare on the\nTrivandrum-Gulf sector is unlikely to yield much till Trivandrum is\ngiven the  ` international'  status, or foreign airlines,\nparticularly the Gulf ones, are allowed to land here. \n\n \n\nEver since the Trivandrum-Gulf operations of Air-India were\nlaunched over a decade ago, there have been demands to reduce the fares.\n\n\nThe proponents of fare reduction, like the  `\nGulf-Trivandrum airfare forum'  , a Dubai-based outfit formed\nrecently to fight for the demand, point out that though the direct\nTrivandrum-gulf service does not come to Bombay, they are charged for that\ndistance too. \n\n \n\nThe flown distance from Trivandrum to Delhi direct is 2,963\nkms while from Bombay to Dubai it is 1,935 kms.\n\n\nIf the plane were to cover the Trivandrum-Bombay distance, for which\nfare is collected from the passengers from Trivandrum, it would have flown\n3,205 kms. \n\n \n\nIn effect, therefore, the Trivandrum-Dubai passenger    who   flies direct pays for the 242 kms he does not\ntravel, the pro-fare-cut lobby contends. \n\n \n\nInformed sources in the airlines say that the Gulf sector fare\nwas calculated basing Bombay and Delhi as the  \" gateway points\"\n and for any travel from Bombay/Delhi to any other point within the\ncountry the fare was added on. \n\n \n\nA highly-placed Air-India official here, who sought anonymity,\ntold the TOINS that it was erroneous to look at things in pure distance\nterms.\n\n\nHe pointed out that the aircraft cannot take short cuts and fly\nwhichever route they want.\n\n\nThey will have to fly through certain air corridors. \n\n \n\nIn any case, the Trivandrum-Dubai passenger by the direct flight\nreaches his destination earlier with less botheration, he added.\n\n\nIf the passenger was to take a flight via Bombay he would have to,\namong other things, wait for hours to catch the next flight to his\ndestination. \n\n \n\n \" In fact, we should be slapping a surcharge for reaching\nthem early but we do not because we are bound by IATA ( International Air\nTransport Association) fares,\"  he reasoned. \n\n \n\nThe official pointed out that Air-India was in no position to\nreduce the fares unilaterally because it was guided by IATA fares and\nbilateral agreements.\n\n\nIt is not that Air-India does not want to do anything.\n\n\n  \" <*> dotted-line</*>.As regards the reduction of fares,\nthe government of India has informed that air fares on the Gulf-India route\nhave been fixed unanimously by all the concerned countries at the IATA forum\nand approved by the concerned governments.\n\n\nThe Union government has stated that it is therefore neither\npossible nor permissible for Air-India to unilaterally charge lower fares <*>\ndotted-line</*>\"   \n\n \n\nThe  ` Gulf-Trivandrum-air-fare forum'  does not\nagree.\n\n\nIt is the representatives of different airlines operating in the same\nsector which formulate a fare, it feels. \n\n \n\nTo the forum,  role was only to send the\nformulated fare to the governments concerned for approval and then publish\nthem after the approval is got. \n\n \n\nIt reasons that since the Trivandrum-Gulf sector was the\n \" monopoly\"  of Air-India there was no question of a\nformulated fare or the IATA coming into the picture. \n\n \n\nAccording to Air-India, any unilateral cut in fares, if at all\nthat was possible, would result in the Gulf countries closing their doors to\nour carriers because the business of their national carriers would be badly\nhit. \n\n \n\nGulf Air alone operates at least 26 flights a week to the Gulf\nfrom Bombay.\n\n\nIt also has six from Delhi.\n\n\nThen there are the Emirates, Saudia, Cathay Pacific, Kuwait, Syrian\nArab Airlines etc, operating in the gulf sector from Bombay. \n\n \n\nTherefore, in the event of a fare reduction, the government will\nhave to willy nilly throw open Trivandrum airport to at least the Gulf\ncarriers and allow them to compete for the Keralite passenger who accounts\nfor the bulk of the Gulf traffic. \n\n \n\nProponents of the fare reduction feel that once Trivandrum was\nopened to the foreign airlines Air-  monopoly would be\nthreatened.\n\n\nAlso, it would have to pull up its socks and improve its  \"\nnone-too-impressive\"  service if it wanted to be in the hunt.\n\n\nThey also contended that Air-India had burnt its fingers by allowing\ncertain foreign carriers to operate in areas which hitherto were its\nmonopoly. \n\n \n\nIn essence, Air-India has a vested interest in not allowing\nforcing airlines to land in Trivandrum, the pro-cut lobby alleges. \n\n \n\nThe Bombay hotel lobby is also said to be interested in seeing\nthat Trivandrum airport does not get an international status.\n\n\nFor, it is argued, passengers from Trivandrum to the Gulf via Bombay\nalone account for an estimated 600 rooms a day.\n\n\nAlso, most of the passengers do not occupy the rooms for more than\n10-12 hours because they have to fly out.\n\n\nThis naturally benefits the hotels more. \n\n \n\nAnother argument for seeking reduction in fare is that the per\nkilometre rate on the Dubai-Trivandrum-Dubai sector was three times\nmore compared to the Bombay-New-York-Bombay sector. \n\n \n\nSimilarly, it is pointed out, that the per kilometre rate on the\nBombay-London-Bombay and Dubai-Bombay-Singapore-Bombay-Dubai sectors\nwere cheaper compared to the Dubai-Trivandrum-Dubai sector.\n\n\nAir-India, for its part, argues that it is the short-distance\npassenger who invariably subsidised the long-distance passenger.\n\n\nAnd it was not true only in the case of airlines but also with any\nmode of transport, it is reasoned.  \n\n\n\n\n Commerzbank plans to enlarge Indian operations \n\n\n By Our <@AS> Financial Editor {#} \n\n \n\n<@PR> BOMBAY {#}, <@DR> January 12

Indian\ncorporations seeking to tap either the German or World capital markets. \n\n \n\nTalking after the formal opening of the representative office, Mr\nKohlhaussen said that over many decades the bank had been actively involved\nin building and strengthening the economic ties between India and Germany.\n\n\nIt had played a key role in handling Indo-German trade. \n\n \n\nHe said the bank had been very active in arranging bond issues\nand syndicated loans for Indian borrowers, especially in the Deutsche Mark\nsector.\n\n\nIt was instrumental in opening up the Euro-DM market for Indian\nborrowers and had handled numerous deals for borrowers like Industrial\nDevelopment Bank of India, Oil and Natural Gas Commission and Steel\nAuthority of India. \n\n \n\nHe said with the office in Bombay, the bank should be able to\nreinforce its position as an intermediary for offering Indian companies more\nthan its century-old expertise in global fund raising.\n\n\nIt would also help entrepreneurs from both the countries intending\nto set up joint ventures. \n\n \n\nAt the end of October 1989, the  consolidated\nbusiness volume totalled 200 billion DM ( around Rs 160,000  crores\n ) . \n\n \n\nThe  substantial international commitment is\nreflected by its worldwide presence extending to some 70 foreign outlets, and\nholdings in over 30 countries, with a network of 900 offices. \n\n \n\nReferring to the  role after the recent events in\nEastern Europe, Mr Kohlhaussen said that the bank would open an office in\nEast Berlin soon.\n\n\nIt was contemplating to have offices in Budapest and Warsaw. \n\n \n\nHe said banks in Western Europe were watching the situation\ncarefully.\n\n\nGerman banks would be very much interested in having a focus on\nEastern Europe in general and East Germany in particular.\n\n\nHowever, his      \ninterest in this region would not result in reducing its commitments to\nthe rest of the world. \n\n \n\nHe felt that private investment was attracted to the regions\nwhich provided best attractions in terms of legal and political environment\nand availability of technical manpower. \n\n \n\nHe felt that India should have ongoing process of\nliberalisation to continue to attract more direct foreign investment. \n\n \n\nReferring to international banking field, he said DM would be\nstronger as a currency.\n\n\nIn the first half of 1990, he did not expect any slow down in the\nGerman economy.\n\n\nInterest rates in U.S. might go down in the short run.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "7  \n\n \n\nNext morning Peter hovered anxiously outside \nbedroom.\n\n\nShe had never been so late for breakfast.\n\n\nWhen he took in her  chota hazari  instead of sitting up in\nbed she had mumbled that he keep it on the night table.\n\n\nHe had sent Laxmi  ayah  inside to check and got the\nreport that Missy Baba was still in bed with the quilt over her head.\n\n\nShe had never done this before.\n\n\nEven if the old Master and Missy Baba had come back at five am from a\nClub dance they had got up on time to go to the stables.\n\n\nThey took a long nap in the afternoon but never shut out the daylight\nby going under a quilt.\n\n\nShould he call the doctor?\n\n\nJust then he heard the bell ring from  room.\n\n\nHe darted in sooner than she expected his appearance.\n\n\nShe was standing next to her bed slipping on her dressing gown. \n\n \n\n ` Missy Baba not well?\n\n\nI thinking call doctor,'  he asked in a hushed voice. \n\n \n\n ` No, no Peter.\n\n\n all right.\n\n\nYou should have woken me up.'  \n\n \n\n ` I call with tea, Missy,'  he said in an injured\ntone.\n\n\n ` There, see tray on table.'  \n\n \n\n ` So you did, Peter.\n\n\nSorry.\n\n\nI slept very late <*> dotted line</*> er, kept reading.\n\n\nGet me bath water, please.\n\n\nNo breakfast.\n\n\nJust a cup of tea.'  \n\n \n\n ` Missy Baba, Mister Fali phone.\n\n\nhe say some <*> dotted line</*> '  \n\n \n\n`  Yes, I know.\n\n\nThe  Raja  of Gawda and his son Pratap are coming to\nvisit the stables.\n\n\n so fearfully late.\n\n\nCan you hurry up, please?'   \n\n \n\n ` Yes, I hurry,'  he said and went out in a rush.\n\n\n \n\nBy the time she arrived at the stables feed was being doled out\nto the syces sitting in a circle.\n\n\nThe buckets in front of them were being filled up with different\nformulas of oats, barley, wheat bran, shark-liver oil, and shamatone,\nsupervised by Terence Hardy, the stud superintendent.\n\n\nShe knew he was puzzled about her late appearance, but she walked on\ntowards the office without giving him any explanation. \n\n \n\nAt the lines, work was going on quietly and efficiently.\n\n\nStable boys under the watchful eyes of the   jamedars\n  were rubbing down the horses with brush and  \nKharara   .\n\n\nMabel held her breath as she skirted around the hay spread out to dry\nin the sun.\n\n\nShe picked up a handful of lucerne grass and offered it to horses who\nwere sticking their necks over their wickets in joyful recognition.\n\n\nWhen she came to Merbani she gave him an extra helping, asking him\nnot to tell the others that he was favoured.\n\n\nShe wanted to know his opinion about racing at Mahalaxmi.\n\n\nHe nodded enthusiastically. \n\n \n\nShe climbed the staircase to her office above the stores.\n\n\nBefore going in she paused on the deck, as she always did, to savour\nthe panoramic view of the green and white symphony of the buildings Jay\nGee had so carefully planned.\n\n\nShe spotted the black baret of Fali Mehta, her trainer, coming\nthrough the trees, hurrying to meet her.\n\n\n ` Come in,'  she said when he knocked on her door.\n\n\n \n\n ` Good morning, Miss Dunne.'  \n\n \n\n ` Good morning, Fali,  sorry I wasn't up when\nyou called.\n\n\nHad a late night.'  \n\n \n\n ` It was somewhat strange not to find you here in the\nmorning.\n\n\nPeter got me worried when I phoned the Dunne House.\n\n\nI wouldn't have disturbed you but the  Raja  of Gawda\nrang up to find out what time he and his son could visit Dunnestable.\n\n\nHe said you had asked him to ring up.'  \n\n \n\n ` What did you tell him?'  \n\n \n\n ` I said you were not in the office, that you were\nvisiting the stables.' \n\n\nFali smiled but finding Mabel unresponsive he  asked hastily,  ` I hope I didn't do anything wrong by telling\nthem to come around eleven?'  \n\n \n\nMabel looked at the clock on her left wall and said,  `\nAnother half-hour.\n\n\nNo, you did the right thing.\n\n\nHe wants to transfer his string of horses to us.\n\n\nI insisted he come and see our establishment before he did that.\n\n\n going on this morning?'  \n\n \n\n ` The vet is doing the pregnancy tests.'  \n\n \n\n `  go there, Fali.\n\n\nYou can bring them over when they arrive.'  she said, pulling\nher chair back.\n\n\nShe felt a compulsion for action, for immersion in her work.\n\n\nShe slipped on her tweed coat with leather patches, worn but intact,\nat the elbows.\n\n\nAfter all the years the coat still had a whiff of his body in it.\n\n\nShe had had it cut down to her size by making the tailor sit at Dunne\nHouse rather than take it to his shop.\n\n\nShe had sat on the verandah while he worked on it.\n\n\nHer hand moved from her riding hat to her  pith\nhelmet on the rack.\n\n\nShe flicked the dust off and put it on her head and peered in the\nmirror.\n\n\nLucy was not wrong, she thought.\n\n\nJay Gee was here all right. \n\n \n\nMabel crossed the deck and was about to step down when she turned\nback to revisit the office.\n\n\nShe phoned the stable and asked for Destiny to be saddled and brought\nas soon as possible.\n\n\nShe waited on the deck looking at the spread of Dunnestable around\nher, indulging in nostalgia.\n\n\nShe recalled the first day of  independence when Jay\nGee had presented her with a filly born that morning and named Destiny by\nhim.\n\n\nHe had liked the phrase,  ` Tryst with Destiny'  ,\nwhen he had heard it in a midnight speech of Nehru on his bedside radio.\n\n\nHe had toasted the infant Republic with beer before lunch, analysed\nthe reasons for their confidence in the Indian Cabinet, and appreciated its\nchoice of Lord Mountbatten as the first Governor-General of free India.\n\n\nJay Gee had often got into passionate discussions with pessimistic\nand bitter English bureaucrats and military officers at the Belpur Club.\n\n\nThey had unanimously forecast a downhill slide for a free, but\nunready India.\n\n\nThe  sub-continent, according to them, would\nnever be able to surmount its diversity and disparities, and emerge in the\ntwentieth century as an equal of the other nations of the world. \n\n \n\nOver round after round of drinks Mabel had sat and watched her\nfather debate without convincing anyone.\n\n\nRejected and isolated, he would bring his arguments back to Dunne\nHouse and exhaust himself over brandy and cigars before allowing Peter to\npersuade him to retire to bed.\n\n\nIt was then that she had understood why Indians, under his\njurisdiction as a Commissioner, had loved him.\n\n\nWell, his faith had not been misplaced.\n\n\nIndia was doing all right, not bad - - so far.\n\n\nThe Indians were certainly not killing every Muslim, or throwing out\nall the Englishmen.\n\n\nEven statues of old rulers were allowed to sit, or stand, on their\npedestals.\n\n\nBelpur was her home as much as anyone  .\n\n\nShe had made a good choice. \n\n \n\nDestiny had arrived near the steps.\n\n\nMabel rode out on him towards the paddocks before making her way to\nthe teasing yard.\n\n\nShe surveyed the foals at foot clinging to their mothers and learning\nto graze.\n\n\nThe pregnant mares were moving heavily in their elite sections.\n\n\nThe others were out in the vast, enclosed space, running with their\nmanes flying deliriously.\n\n\nShe felt exhilarated by the sights that sped past her, and the\nsensation of power and speed under her. \n\n \n\nThere were still ten mares in the queue by the time Mabel rode up\nto the teasing yard.\n\n\nIt was a routine test, taken after two weeks, of the supervised\nmating of the mares with highly prized studs.\n\n\nThe vet was surprised by the unusual visit of Miss Dunne.\n\n\nHe got up to greet her but she signalled him to carry on.\n\n\nA syce helped her down from Destiny.\n\n\nShe sat down on a chair they had brought out for her.\n\n\nThe mares to be tested were being kept out of sight of the grey\nmidget stud, Don Emilio. \n\n \n\nHis lively tail was whisking up dust from the ground behind him.\n\n\nHe looked pleased with his mane plaited with magenta and white\nribbons, the racing colours of Dunne-stable,  \ntossing his head imperiously, impatiently pulling at the ropes which tied him\nsecurely to two posts.\n\n\nThree mares were led in succession and proved to be pregnant as Don\nEmilio showed no interest in them.\n\n\nDeclared with foal at foot they were taken away with new respect by\ntheir smiling syces, and the vet triumphantly put a tick against their names\non his pad.\n\n\nHe handed the pad to Mabel to see the earlier results.\n\n\nShe was congratulating him on the almost eighty percent success he\nhad achieved when she heard the  Raja  of Gawda wishing her\nthe time of day. \n\n \n\nWhen he introduced her to his son, Pratap, Mabel felt slightly\napprehensive about Lucy meeting him.\n\n\nHis high forehead, wavy hair and sideburns made an attractive\nsetting for his almond-shaped eyes which, she thought, he must have\ninherited from his mother.\n\n\nBiceps peeping out of rolled up shirt sleeves, thrust of chest, and\nthe wide stance of long legs declared the pride of the owner in his\ncultivated masculinity.\n\n\nHe was alert, taking in the scene with a wide-angle sweep.\n\n\nWhen Mabel explained Don  teasing exercise he\nwas immediately interested.\n\n\nHis attention became riveted on the next mare being led in.\n\n\nThe little stud stopped moving, stood stock still, entranced,\nstaring at the tall mare.\n\n\nSlowly his penis stiffened and the red tip came out, longer and\nlonger.\n\n\nHis body began to shiver uncontrollably.\n\n\nHe raised his front legs as high as he could.\n\n\nThe ropes tensed and held him helpless. \n\n \n\n ` Is he never allowed to mate?'  Pratap asked\nFali. \n\n \n\n ` No,  not meant for breeding' \nFali Mehta replied.\n\n\n `  genetically inferior.'  \n\n \n\n ` Poor chap , '  Pratap commiserated.\n\n\n ` Not his fault, is it?'  \n\n \n\nThe  Raja  was feeling self-conscious and\nembarrassed by the whole operation.\n\n\nThis was not the kind of place where a woman should allow hereself\nto be.\n\n\nHe turned his back and asked Mabel if they could see the stables.\n\n\n \n\n ` Why certainly,'  Mabel replied.\n\n\n ` Fali, will you please show them around?\n\n\n stay on here till the exercise is over and then go to\nthe office.\n\n\nBring them there when you finish .'   \n\n \n\nThe  Raja  felt slighted.\n\n\nPratap wanted to stay on to watch the teasing.\n\n\nHis father gave him a peremptory look and said to Mabel, `  `\n very kind of you to allow us to visit, mabel.\n\n\nI can understand why you won't take another round after your visit\nto the stables earlier in the day.'  \n\n \n\n ` Ay <*> dotted line</*> yes <*> dotted line </*> yes , '\n Mabel had momentarily forgotten about her late start.\n\n\n ` Do excuse me.\n\n\nWould you like some tea or beer when you finish the round?' \n\n\n \n\nThey both opted for beer.   <*>\nstar</*> <*> star</*> <*> star</*> \n\n \n\n head felt lumpy and her tongue had swollen and\nfilled her dry, bitter-tasting mouth.\n\n\nShe tried to open her lips; they were like a rough elastic that\nrefused to stretch.\n\n\nHer hand - - where was her hand?\n\n\nOh yes, right beside her.\n\n\nShe moved the fingers and felt the cool sheet.\n\n\nHer arm felt like lead; in a little while  lift it.\n\n\n \n\nWhy should she get up?\n\n\nWhat was there to be done by her, and her alone?\n\n\nShe could stay in bed and nobody would miss her.\n\n\nMabel?\n\n\nMabel would.\n\n\nMabel must have peeped in and seen her dead to the world, left the\ndarkness undisturbed in the bedroom, shut the door quietly, and driven off to\nher farm.\n\n\nWhat time was it now?\n\n\nWho cared?\n\n\nTime just runs - - no purpose, no aim, just runs.\n\n\nSuch things should be ignored. \n\n \n\nThe time had come to lift her hand.\n\n\nNow.\n\n\nNo,  count five and then lift it.\n\n\nOne, two, three ( must five come?\n\n\nSlow it up ) <*> dotted line</*> er four <*> dotted line</*> hmm\nfive.\n\n\nLift. \n\n \n\nShe lifted her arm, brought the hand near the mouth, and worked\nthe lips with her fingers.\n\n\nNow they should open, and they did.\n\n\nThe tongue was stuck.\n\n\nShe sucked some air and waited for the saliva to wet the mouth.\n\n\nThat was better.\n\n\nShe could move the tongue.\n\n\nIt felt awaful.\n\n\nWhy did she take all this trouble to move it?\n\n\nLet it alone.  \n\n \n\nShe lay still and projected herself into the room, into the\nbungalow, into the birds and crows livening her windows ( ugh, the noise they\nmake ) , into the   mali   she could hear watering\nthe rose bushes outside, and down the slope into the farm house.\n\n\nShe could imagine Mabel making her round, petting the horses in the\nstables, checking the cleanliness, the feed, the health and happiness of\nher animals.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4f6fb497-4317-403e-b871-a8751665bc58", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.249609+00:00"}
{"text": "Fishing in India is very limited though India has long    coast   line.\n\n\n contribution towards fishing is not even 6 % because\nmainly India is  a  tropical country.\n\n\nIn this area fishing activity is very limited because  no importance is given to fishing activity. \n\n \n\nBut today fishing activity is also developed because of fishing\nbank.\n\n\nIn many areas such as fishing bank is developed  e.g.  Grand\nBank. \n\n \n\nFishing is developed in that area 1)    where\n   part  and planktons are   \navailable   .\n\n\nBut in tropics this is not    possible. \n\n\n\n2)  pan  and planktons are growing in water because they are\nthe food of fish.\n\n\nIf this  grows on large scale then fishing activity is\ndeveloped on large scale.\n\n\n3) Growing planktons in  water is not\ndeveloped in tropical areas.\n\n\n4) In tropical areas there    are   people\nwho  do not eat fish or consume fish or if they  consume fish on  certain days.\n\n\nSo the activity of fishing is very poorly developed in    tropical   areas but in other areas there is no problem\nabout consumption of fish\n\n\n5) In tropics Government is not giving finance to    fishermen   like    \nbuiding   ships or  provide  nets etc.\n\n\n Government's  contribution towards fishing activity is very\npoor.\n\n\n6) In    tropical   areas fisherman has\nno communication facility.\n\n\nSo there is always a problem to fisherman to go and catch fish. \n\n\n \n\n \n\nAnimal farming is more developed in that area where  more grass    is   available for animals.\n\n\nTherefore India started to grow grass on a large scale.\n\n\nIn    Australia green   grass,\n   red   grass,    blue \n grass, Alfa-Alfa grass is available\n\n\nSo in that area animal farming is developed. \n\n \n\n New Zealand is  near South\npole.\n\n\nSo in that area rain is    plenty    in that area grass is growing on continuously, people also  develop in that grass because they know if grass is available\nthen the animals  become fat.\n\n\nIn    New Zealand   mountainous area\nis more, so they  do not grow farms but only  grow grass\n for sheep in that area  so that they  become fat and\n  more demand for mutton  but wool  of the    sheep  \nis very low quality. \n\n \n\nBut as compared to    Australia \n that is  to south pole so in that area rain is not in\n   plenty   .\n\n\nSo in that area grass is available on  limited\nquantity, but the grass is very low quality as compared to \n  New Zealand   .\n\n\nSo sheep in    those   areas are not very\nfat  and  more demand on mutton  but wool they have is very good quality.\n\n\nSo    there is   demand for wool\nmarket.  \n\n \n\n \n\nIndian trade in olden days    was  \nvery poor in the British days.\n\n\nBritishers  did  not develop trade with any other\n   countries  \n\n\n They developed trade only with    Great Britain   .\n\n\nThey  export raw materials from India and imported\n finished goods to India. \n\n \n\nBut nowadays India developed its  own \ntrading activities.\n\n\nBut India has very limited trade with    its \n neighbours.\n\n\n   Indian sea trade   is\nalso developed because India has very long    coast \n line.\n\n\nIndia has not much developed trade with   \nPakistan   , Bangladesh etc because       sea water transport is not very developed.\n\n\nIndia developed its trade by land, road,\nor Rail. \n\n \n\nIndia    has   very limited trade with\n   neighbouring   countries that is  the\n main problem is that India  has  not developed trade with English\nspeaking countries.\n\n\nBut India    now-a-days trying  \nto develop trade with English speaking countries such as  \n Canada   , America etc.\n\n\nIndia exports raw material like    cotton \n , oil seeds etc, and import machinery electric  material\netc.\n\n\nBut today India also exports machinery, coal of good quality etc.\n\n\nBut compared to neighbouring countries like Pakisthan, Bangladesh\nIndia is very poor with this country because of   \nreligious   , language barrier.  \n\n \n\n \n\nIndustry is the activity of second order, primary products are\nnot storable or transportable so they wants to convert this \nproduct into fishined products so industry  takes place. \n\n \n\nIndustry is based on many factors such as, capital, raw\nmaterials, demand and market for    products  \ntransport facilities etc., as capital or raw mterials    are\n  important to start an Industry.\n\n\nPower is also very important for Industry. \n\n \n\nIn olden days man used his own man power to produce a particular\ntype of product or they used animal power.\n\n\nBut in those days production    was   very\nlimited as population    was small   the\nwants of people    were   also very few and they \n  were   fulfilled by them.\n\n\nBut in these days we use many machinery and to employ\nmachinery power is necessary.\n\n\nSo we use    electricity   but \n  electricity   is also very limited so we\nused coal to produce power for industry.\n\n\nIn olden days coal    was of   very good\nquality and on burning coal is given very high quantity of heat.\n\n\nSo on that industry    was   run.\n\n\nBut on burning, coal    was   also given as\nash, so that is the problem.\n\n\nBut in India coal of good quality is not available\n\n\nCoal in India gives very less amount of heat for industry and very\nmore amount of ash this is the  problem in\nIndia.\n\n\nBut  electricity  as a  resource    is   not  more quantity.\n\n\nSo coal is used in olden days  industrial  activity is  fulfilled by using coal. So  coal is the  ` Black\nGold'  for industry.  \n\n \n\n \n\nRivers of    peninsular   India\nof little use of navigation because of following reason - -\n\n\n1) Rivers in India    are   dry in summer.\n\n\nSo they are  not  useful for navigation.\n\n\nThey dry in summer,  and it  is full of water in rainy season,\nso navigation is impossible.\n\n\n2)  Conner  of river is not  smooth area.\n\n\nThere are some waterfalls  waterlips  etc.\n\n\nSo navigation is not possible.\n\n\n3<)>  Conners  of rivers   do  not match\nfor navigation.\n\n\n4) Government contribution is not for  navigation.\n\n\nThere is no point for navigation.\n\n\nGovernment or semi-Government  does  not give amount or any\nfinancial help to those rivers.\n\n\n5) In rivers, there is no point    in  \nloading.\n\n\nLoading means, that is, goods or   \npassangers   loading.\n\n\nThere is such a point for this or any facility for this. \n\n \n\nSo navigation of peninsular  in  India is  of  very\nlittle use.  \n\n   \n\n \n\nAs soon as man appeared on the surface of the earth\nhe started  re searching for\nhis    Environment  \n\n\nThen he found that his    Environment \n or surroundings could provide him valuable material to satisfy his\nneeds.\n\n\nAs there    are   living things there \n  are   non-living things also in the surroundings\n\n\nLiving things such as plants  animals, insects etc.,\nand nonliving  things  like rivers,  mountains etc.,\n \n\n \n\nOn mountain there is no possibility for man to do his main\nactivity because there is no flat land available for doing some    acivities   such as farming, animal farming etc.,\n\n\nAs there is no    flat   land is    available   there is facility like transport;\nindustry etc.\n\n\nIn that area rain is also limited so    field\n  farming is also not developed  there is less of\nindustry so there is less at job   \n opportunity   or employment.\n\n\nSo people on that area say that  there is no job \n  opportunities   and also Government does\nnot provide any help to them or  they are    neglected   by people.\n\n\nSo they started to come on    commercial\n  area \n\n \n\n that is why mountain is exporters of people. \n\n\n \n\n \n\nCultural    environment   is\nthe    environment   created by man.\n\n\nMan is the most important  one  in the    environment   because he is the   \nintelligent   animal of all. He has created his own    environment   and in fact he   \ndid   so but other animals cannot do so\n\n\nSo man is growing importance towards the  \n environment  \n\n\nMan can change or modify his   \nenvironment   and create a new   \nenvironment   as  he wants or    suitable   for him.\n\n\nSo man is the most    intelligent  \nor main part of the    environment   .\n\n\n \n\nAs man is the most important  animal  in the\nenvironment he  influences on human    activities   there is always a difference between    different religions   .\n\n\nMan of different    religions  \ncreates problems.\n\n\n In India there is   \n a big   population, of different   \nreligions   Hindu,    Muslim,\nChristian   etc.\n\n\n   Christians   consume fish but\n many of some type; they consume fish on  very\nlimited days or limited months. \n\n \n\nlanguage is also a barrier as in India many type of    men   live so language is also different.\n\n\nEnglish speaking or marathi  speaking  etc.\n\n\nBut Hindi is a Government language    Marathi\n  is comman language and English is a   \ncommercial   language in India. \n\n \n\nIn India many    religious   ideas\n grow as people    are   Hindus.\n\n\nThere is no importance of bread  making  activity and also\npeople want fresh  food material. \n\n \n\nThere is also a problem that in olden days people  did \nnot send  to  women to any  \n place.  \n\n\nSo there    was   only man to do work.\n\n\nWomen work at  house but in other countries women get white\n collar job.\n\n\nwomen  also work with man and  help to\nnation. \n\n \n\nThere is also some political factor which also influences on\ncultural    environment   such as\nGovernment semi-Government  private companies etc.  \n\n \n\n\n  Social forestry  - - \n\n \n\nFor a very long time in U.S.A and    Canada\n   more importance    was  \ngiven to    commercial   forestry means\nwhich gives food, raw material, or any other resources. These plants or\nforest is only growing, that means they grow  important\ntrees only.\n\n\nthis is    commercial   development\nof forestry.\n\n\n   Scientists   are very much \n  afraid   about this one sided development.\n\n\nThey thought that this is not correct   \npractice   also grow any other  plants which    are   not    commercially  \ndeveloped  otherwise there is an effect  \n on   soil    erosion   , pollution\netc. \n\n \n\nSo they started to develop social forestry also.\n\n\nThis is more important to  man because soil \n  erosion   or pollution is a major problem to man.\n\n\n They do not work on    fields\n  due to soil-    erosion   but if\nsocial forestry is developed there is no fear about soil  \n erosion   etc. \n\n \n\nIn olden days India    was   famous for\nmaking wooden article or toy making article of wood etc., but today there is\nno demand for these because wood is not available for making these articles.\n\n\nAlso there is demand for food resources   \nbecause   forests provide us very important resources.\n\n\nBut this is not    possible   today\nbecause of deforestation of forests. \n\n \n\nThere is food for animal from forests but this is also not \n  possible   because forest is not on a very\nlarge scale\n\n\nSo scientists said that grow forests.\n\n\nIn India there    are   bare hills or\nmountains or roads.\n\n\nSo grow    their   plants.\n\n\nIf in roadway we grow various  types of plants \n  it   is more beautiful.\n\n\nWe grow plants on road side, we grow plants like    Gulmohar   - - beautiful flowers, fruit so they \nattracted by    tourists   and birds.  \n\n \n\n\n Influence of man on plant environment \n\n \n\nSince man is knowing about his surroundings or Environment,\nas soon as he appears on the earth he started searching of  his \nsurroundings.\n\n\nThat his surroundings or    Environment\n  could provide him valuable material to satisfy \nhistory of mankind \n\n\nHis surroundings could give him living as well as non-living\nmaterials, living such as plants, animals, insects etc., and non-livings \nsuch  as mountains    rivers   etc. \n\n \n\nPlants could provide him valuable material such as food, furs,\nnuts      lac   \n Dink  etc.\n\n\nPlants also provide him raw materials such as  wood\nfor making wooden articles etc. \n\n\nForest provides him    with protection \n from the fury of the rain  or  scorching\nheat of the sun.\n\n\nForest also provides shelter to the wild  animals\netc.\n\n\nAs plant provides very much to man    there \n is influence of man on plants animals that man uses various resources\navailable from plants.\n\n\nMan changes seasons of the plants.\n\n\nWheat is the winter product  in India but summer\nproduct in    Australia   .\n\n\nMan also changes colours of the flowers.\n\n\nThey  have  introduced many new products such as coffee from\n Adiba, Gulmohar from South Cocoa from Africa etc.\n\n\nMan also changes the seasons of plants means he can grow products\nfor many times by using various new skill.", "subdomain": "INDIA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "65d88263-475d-4706-a1d8-13684cafd275", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:55.251223+00:00"}
{"text": "Sight and sound communication  \n\n\nby KALPANA RAJARAM  \n\n \n\nInformation - - the right to it may not be\nrecognised as fundamental in many countries, but not even the most tyrannical\nof governments can suppress the human craving for it.\n\n\nWith the rapid development of the electronic media\ntechnology-communication satellites, cable networks, dish antennae, it is\nbecoming increasingly difficult for  ` authority'  to even\ncontrol  access to information. \n\n \n\nThe electronic media comprises the audio or sound medium, namely\nradio and the audio-visual medium of television.\n\n\nBoth steal a march over the printed word in that they can\ninstantaneously, or near instantaneously, transmit  ` news'\n all over the world simultaneously.\n\n\nYou can hear about or  ` see'  Sergei Bubka pole vault\nto a new record; the Gulf War is brought  ` live'  to you,\ncourtesy CNN; you keep abreast of the latest poll results with Prannoy Roy\nand Vinod Dua on Doordarshan.\n\n\nYou marvel at the technology that has made it possible.\n\n\nPerhaps, as the credits roll, you feel a sneaking desire to be out\nthere, not receiving but providing the information-gathering, compiling,\nweaving the ingredients into a vibrant programme, creating the software\nwithout which the most sophisticated equipment is equivalent to junk. \n\n\n  A tough world  \n\n \n\nA career in the electronic media can be interesting and exciting,\non the face of it, even glamorous; but in reality it is hard work in a tough\nworld - - a world in which dog eats dog calmly, firmly and unhesitatingly, a\nworld where you have to keep your wits about you to survive and run faster\nand faster just to remain where you are.\n\n\nThe Indian scene has its own special difficulties.\n\n\nAll talk of autonomy, functional or otherwise, has so far led nowhere\nand both radio and television are firmly under government control.\n\n\nQuality is often at a discount, more so on  Doordarshan\n than on radio, as programming is guided by considerations other than\nprofessionalism.\n\n\nAny attempt at free and fearless communication of ideas and\ninformation is thwarted in the erroneous belief that it may hamper  `\ndevelopment'  or  ` social harmony'  . \n\n \n\nPoliticisation and bureaucratisation of the electronic media with\nthe attendant corruption, disregard for merit and rewards for sycophancy\nhave bred cynicism and despair in many who are still interested in\nprofessional programming.\n\n\nHowever, with the mushrooming of video newsmagazines and now cable\ntelevision, demand for software is beginning to go up.\n\n\nAnd in time quality and professionalism are bound to be the\nguiding principles - - as they already are in some media organisations.\n\n\nThe electronic media thus have a large potential for employment -\n- part-time, full-time, freelance or working for a particular organisation.\n\n\n\n  To get a foothold  \n\n \n\nThis field is one in which practical experience has as much value\nas, if not more than, any formal training.\n\n\nEven the courses that are offered at various institutions demand, as\na criterion for admission,  ` definite evidence of acquaintance'\n with some aspect of the media, be it photography, creative writing,\nbroadcasting, graphic art design or journalism in print.\n\n\nIt is clear that you must begin your association with the media at an\nearly age.\n\n\nIndeed, many a successful freelancer today began his or her career\nwith the  programmes on radio or television. \n\n \n\nMostly, however, the stepping stone in the audio media is the\n Yuv Vani  of All India Radio ( AIR).\n\n\nSimilarly, on television, you may make your primary impact in the\nyouth programmes of  Doordarshan  .\n\n\nAll said and done, exposure on the official channels is invaluable to\nfurther your career in the electronic media.\n\n\nYou must take the initiative in this manner: write or personally\napply to the producer in charge of the section, stating clearly your field of\ninterest, what you want to do, alongwith a brief bio-data.\n\n\nContrary to general opinion, you are seldom turned down out of hand,\nunless you are blatantly below the required standard.\n\n\nIn the audio media you are required to pass a voice test or audition\nif you want to present your programme.\n\n\nOn television, a pleasant personality is also called for.\n\n\nHowever, even if you do not measure up to the demands of audition,\nthere are several areas behind the scenes where your talents can be utilised.\n\n\nAll the time you must assess your performance critically, never lose\nan opportunity to pick up hints and valuable suggestions, and try to locate\nthe particular area in which you may excel.\n\n\nNor must you miss the opportunity to meet the right person who could\npossibly give you an opening in the future, the right kind of break which\ncan take you way ahead of others in this field. \n\n\n  Two mainstreams  \n\n \n\nProgramming in the electronic media involves in the main ( i)\nProduction and ( ii) Technical operations.\n\n\nIn reality production inevitably includes technical operations, but a\npeculiar distinction is made in that  ` technical ops'  is\nconsidered as relating to those aspects in which actual use of machines is\ninvolved.\n\n\nIn all the fields, however, a creative approach is needed. \n\n \n\nThe production side draws upon various talents.\n\n\nThe Producer is in overall charge of a programme.\n\n\nHe or she thinks of an idea, conceptualises the programme, chooses\nthe artists suitable for the subject, decides upon the format ( after\nconsulting media researchers if necessary), and coordinates the\ntranslation of ideas and information into a programme suitable for the audio\nor audiovisual medium, as the case may be.\n\n\nClearly the Producer must have a good knowledge of the demands,\nadvantages, limitations and impact of the particular medium he works for.\n\n\nMaking programmes for radio and television calls for different\napproaches and talents.\n\n\nIt is, of course, the top job as far as making a programme is\nconcerned. \n\n \n\nSo far official policy has been to rec-ruit producers directly\nor by promoting  production assistants.\n\n\nProgramme executives ( P Ex), as they are called, are inducted\nthrough the UPSC on basis of administrative ability and subject\nspecialisation and then sent for a shortterm training session in\nproduction skills.\n\n\nIt may be pointed out that for a long time formal training in this\nfield was not easily available.\n\n\nBut now there are institutions offering courses in production.\n\n\nProfessionalism calls for intensive training in production skills\nthat can be attained from degree, diploma and certificate courses in mass\ncommunication offered by select institutions.\n\n\nFreelancers specially benefit from these, as they not only learn the\nbasic techniques but also come into contact with production centres and\npeople in the media and thus job possibilities. \n\n \n\nA Production  job includes contacting\ntalents, getting contracts cleared in official agencies, arranging for the\nunit, transportation, studio requirements, etc.\n\n\nThe official media recruits them directly, advertising for graduates\nor even postgraduates, with knowledge of a regional language besides\nEnglish/Hindi, cultural traditions of India and the region, and production\nsense, among other things.\n\n\nIn time they can be promoted to the  post.\n\n\nThere is plenty of opportunity to work on a casual basis in the\nofficial media as well as in private production.\n\n\nYou have to take the initiative and send in your bio-data and\napplication to the stations and production centres for consideration and\ninclusion on their  ` panel'  .\n\n\nSelection is on the basis of interview. \n\n \n\nAny programme on radio or television requires a script and\nscreenplay.\n\n\nWriting for the electronic media, again, calls for a special\napproach.\n\n\nFormal training helps in effective writing.\n\n\nOpenings on casual basis exist in abundance. \n\n \n\nThe electronic media also calls for researchers.\n\n\nWhile the content researcher for a programme is usually a subject\nexpert ( a university lecturer, educationist, research assistant or\nscientist, and so on), the field researcher works out the possible impact of\na particular programme in certain areas or on certain target audiences.\n\n\nA Media Researcher knows best the format in which a certain kind of\ninformation should be put to derive the maximum impact: whether to go in for\na documentary or a feature, a play or the folk form or a mix of more than one\ngenre.\n\n\nHere, again, a course in mass communication is an asset.\n\n\nAny worthwhile production unit will demand the talents of a Media\nResearcher. \n\n \n\nComing to the audible and visible components of the electronic\nmedia, the most striking are the Announcer and the Newsreader.\n\n\nHere, too, experience as a compere or presenter of programmes on a\ncasual basis in the youth sections proves to be an asset.\n\n\nThe basic requirements are a degree from a recognised university,\nvoice suited for broadcasting with good pronunciation and accent ( for\ntelevision, of course, a pleasing personality is an added requirement),\nknowledge of the    language relevant to the region, acquaintance with\ncultural traditions and current affairs.\n\n\nThe candidate is required to have some experience in broadcasting\nand/or creative writing. \n\n \n\nSelection is on the basis of a written test ( n AIR), voice test,\nscreen test ( on TV) and interview.\n\n\nThe test may involve writing announcements, presentation scripts for\nspecial programmes/ audiences, etc.\n\n\nThe job in AIR involves even helping in production of programmes\nand in maintaining records, reading scripts and stories.\n\n\nOn  Doordarshan  , however, the job is more\nrestricted.\n\n\nThere are plenty of work opportunities for the Announcer.\n\n\nHe or she can branch out into interviewing, presentation, and also\ngive voice over ( or commentaries) in documentaries and features in private\nproductions.\n\n\nIt is a lucrative field besides offering interesting variety. \n\n \n\nA Newsreader is expected to have qualifications similar to those\nof the Announcer with added emphasis on general awareness and good\npronunciation, specially the name of people and places.\n\n\nQuick-witted response to crisis situations is also expected as news\nis always  ` live'  .\n\n\nKnowing more than two lnaguages, especially a foreign language, is an\nasset.\n\n\nNewsreaders have a special audition on both radio and television.\n\n\nThey too can find lucrative jobs in private productions as\ncommentators, comperes, interviewers and script readers. \n\n \n\nThe News Section in AIR has a special importance.\n\n\nWith a good command over language and a feel for the medium, you\ncould become a correspondent or reporter feeding the stations with\ninformation from various places.\n\n\n Doordarshan  has a few correspondents but openings\nin the organisation do not exist at present.\n\n\nHowever, there is scope for television correspondents in agencies\nlike PTI or for video magazines like  Newstrack, India View  and\n Eyewitness  .\n\n\nA degree or diploma in Journalism or Mass Communication is necessary.\n\n\n \n\nTelevision production holds out openings for other qualified\npersonnel also.\n\n\nIf you have done a  course from any recognised\ninstitution you can become a  ` Make-up Artist'  ; anyone\nappearing before the strong lights of television needs his or her face\ntouched up to suit the camera.\n\n\nIf you have a degree in Fine Arts, you could become a Set Designer\nfor studio recordings.\n\n\nExperience in stage production is a desirable qualification.\n\n\nA degree/ diploma in Commercial Art from a college of Art or any\npolytechnic enables you to branch out into the expanding field of computer\ngraphics.\n\n\nThe simple captions, line drawings, portraits, animated diagrams and\nillustrations, graphs and maps that enliven any programme and clarify dull\nor involved factual details, are very much in demand these days.\n\n\nIn this field, association with the advertising agencies is a\ngreat help.\n\n\nA computer graphics man can earn anywhere between  Rs\n 2,000 and  Rs  10,000 per assignment.\n\n\nAnd how fast you can finish an assignment depends upon  you. \n\n \n\nThe technical operations hold out a variety of employment\nopportunities, too. \n\n\n  Technical operations  \n\n \n\nProduction on radio involves mainly the Sound Engineer on the\ntechnical front.\n\n\nAfter recording the different ingredients - - statements,\ninterviews, sound effects, community and musicrequired for a programme on\na multiple track tape recorder, the Sound Engineer puts them all together\nin the required sequence and proportion, in other words, edits the programme\non the directions of the Producer.\n\n\nIt is now ready for broadcast.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\nA career in the electronic media can be interesting and exciting, on\nthe face of it, even glamorous; but in reality it is hard work in a tough\nworld - - a world where you have to keep your wits about you to survive and\nrun faster and faster just to remain where you are <*> dotted line</*>\n\n\nThis field is one in
