{"text": "New stripe and multifrequency techniques for Fabry-Perot\n\nvelocimetry are incorporated into an analytical model for the entire system.\n Properties of striped interferometers ( FP 's) are derived.\n An understanding of energy flow in both striped and unstriped FP 's is\n\npresented.\n Nine contributions to the velocity resolution are examined, and\n\nanalytical approximations are provided for each of them.\n Formulas for the overall velocity and time resolution of each fringe\n\nare derived.\n Using brightness arguments to limit the maximum usable light\n\nacceptable by the system, we also derived analytical limits on the\n\nphotographic writing speed of each fringe.\n\n\n  Optical velocimetry based on Fabry-Perot interferometers ( FP 's)\n\noperating in the fringe mode is a widely used measuring technique in research\n\nwith explosives, gas-propelled projectiles, and electrically accelerated\n\nobjects.1 Since Ref.\n 1 was published, two recent new ideas providing more capability for\n\nthis technique have emerged.\n Gidon and Behar2 have demonstrated an order of magnitude more laser\n\npower by using a pulsed dye laser followed by an FP filter set to the same\n\nspacing as the conventional analyzer FP.\n The interference patterns for each filtered frequency overlap almost\n\nperfectly at the slit of the streaking camera, effectively making all\n\nnonmonochromatic filtered power useful.\n In addition, McMillan et al.3 have applied a striped analyzer FP to\n\nuse more efficiently the light reflected by a moving test object.\n In this technique, one removes a narrow stripe of the reflective\n\ncoating on the upstream mirror to avoid the large losses ( of the order of\n\n90%) that normally arise from reflection.\n\n  These two ideas are not without drawbacks, however.\n The multifrequency technique involves a slight broadening of most of\n\nthe interference fringes caused by the imperfect overlap, and the stripe\n\ntechnique involves the problem of inducing the reflected light to enter the\n\nstripe.\n The latter issue is a function of the size of the illumination on the\n\ntarget, averaged over the target travel distance, and the solid angle of the\n\ncollection optics.\n\n  Our purpose is to provide a set of fairly simple analytical\n\nformulas for users to compare the total velocity resolution, time resolution,\n\nand photographic writing speed of one striped velocimeter configuration with\n\nanother.\n The major simplification in our approach is the treatment of the\n\nfraction of light reflected by the target that can enter the instrument.\n We have written a code ( STRIPE) that calculates in detail the amount\n\nof light at each instant of time from a moving Lambertian target that enters\n\nan array of real collection fibers and illuminates the strip on the FP\n\nmirrors.\n To present the results as analytical formulas, however, we do not use\n\nSTRIPE here.\n\n  Instead, we simply calculate the ratio of the emittance ( or\n\nbrightness) acceptance of the instrument to the emittance reflected by the\n\ntarget.\n This helps to determine, for any optical transport system between the\n\ntarget and the instrument, an upper limit on the amount of useful light.\n Work with STRIPE has shown us that it is not difficult for real\n\nsystems to collect 30% of the amount of light represented by the\n\nemittance-argument limit.\n The present work is intended to be useful in comparing various\n\nreflectivities, mirror spacings, and streak-camera properties to see how they\n\naffect the net time and velocity resolutions and the upper limit on the\n\nphotographic writing speed for each interference fringe.\n\n  We derive a simple analytical result for the effect on fringe\n\nfinesse of the angular divergence of light entering an FP filter.\n We also derive several properties of striped FP 's.\n For example, we present a good simple analytical approximation for\n\nthe total finesse of a striped FP with finite-sized nonflat mirrors.\n An explanation of some of the properties of normal as well as striped\n\nFP 's with regard to energy flow is given.\n It is shown below that diffraction plays a key role in understanding\n\nenergy transport in the striped FP, even for light beams several centimeters\n\nin diameter.\n Figure 1 shows the system being modeled.\n A dye-pumped laser oscillator beam2 is expanded by a telescope to\n\nreduce angular divergence.\n It then enters an FP filter and is transported to the target,\n\nreflected, and collected by a lens.\n This light is then converged in one dimension by a cylindrical lens\n\nand enters an analyzer FP with a stripe of its reflective coating removed.\n The exiting light is focused by a spherical lens onto the slit of an\n\nelectronic streak camera. \n\n\n\n\n  1 has\n\na stripe of half-width  R  st removed.\n The length of the stripe equals the mirror diameter.\n\n\n2.\n We first consider only light incident at a large enough angle that\n\nmultiple reflection occurs, as indicated in Fig. 2 [ OMITTED].\n It is straightforward, by using the standard formalism illustrated\n\nfor normal FP 's in Ref. 4, to calculate the intensity at the focal plane of a\n\nspherical lens vs incident angle for perfectly flat mirrors.\n The sum of the transmitted beamlet amplitudes is [ equation] ( 1)\n\nwhere the phase  d  is given by [ equation] ( 2)  h\n\n is the mirror separation,  v  is the frequency, and  c\n\n is the speed of light. Here  r  1 and  r  2 are the\n\namplitude reflectivities of the two dielectric coatings, and  t  2\n\nis the amplitude transmission of the second coating.\n The ratio of transmitted to incident intensities is [ equation] where\n\nthe reflectivity  R  is given by [ equation] [ equation]\n\n  is typically ~0.002 and accounts for\n\nabsorption and scattering Peaks in the transmission multiple of 2 p\n\n .\n In this paper, this peaks are due to variations in either frequency\n\nor angle.\n in Eqs.(4)\n\nand ( 5), Eq.(3) agrees with expression ( 5.3.1) given in the text by\n\nHernandez for a side-illuminated FP.\n A striped FP allows one to see fringes on both sides of the center of\n\nthe pattern, as opposed to the side-illuminated FP.\n As pointed out in Ref. 1, the analysis of the pattern is much easier\n\nif fringes on both sides of 0\u00ba are available.\n\n  j of Eq. ( 3) are [\n\nequation] where int means the integer part of,  X  is the\n\nwavelength,  k  is a positive integer ( usually less than 5), and\n\n j  is given by [ equation]\n is the fractional order of interference and has a\n\nvalue between 0 and 1.\n is a real number.\n This notation is shown in Fig. 3.\n of Ref. 1.\n The second form of Eq.\n ( 6) is a good approximation to the resonant angles, since they are\n\nusually smaller than 0.01 rad.\n\n  The ratio of the separation of the transmission peaks to their\n\nfull width at half-maximum ( FWHM), when the phase, or the product  v\n\n cos  O  , is varied, is called the finesse and is\n\ngiven by [ equation] the latter form being the limit for large  R  ,\n\nwhich is accurate to 0.1% for  R  greater than 0.86.\n\n  1 =1, the transmission of the striped FP can be\n\nwritten as\n\n \n\n  ,\n\nit will often be best to have  R  1 = 1, since this produces about\n\ntwice the peak intensity compared with  R  1  R  2 =  R\n\n .\n For example, Eqs. ( 3) and ( 9) show that a pair of 99.8 and 92.3%\n\nreflectivity mirrors with  A  = 0.002 transmit ~1.95 times at much\n\nlight as a pair of 96% mirrors, but both have the same finesse or velocity\n\nresolution.\n 1= 1, almost all the energy must\n\nexit to the right of the mirror pair.\n\n\n  An advantage of the stripe over the normal FP is shown by\n\ncomparing Eq. ( 9) with the result for the normal FP: [ equation] where \n\nR  is the reflectivity common to both mirrors.\n 1 =\n\n0.998,  R  2 = 0.923, and  A  = 0.002, the peak intensity\n\nfor the striped FP is 51 times as large as that for the normal FP with  R\n\n = 0.96 and the same finesse.\n In most cases, part of this transmission advantage is canceled\n\nbecause only a fraction of the illumination can be made to enter the stripe.\n The stripe technique will be advantageous when the product of the\n\nillumination size on the target and the angular range of the collected light\n\nare small enough.\n Comparing Eqs. ( 9) and ( 10) shows that the absorption A decreases\n\nthe peak transmission of the normal FP by a large percentage than it does for\n\nthe striped FP with  R  1 = 1.\n = 0.97, absorption\n\ndecreases the normal FP peak transmission by 18% but drops the striped FP\n\ntransmission by less than 4%.\n This can be understood qualitatively by considering just a single\n\nbeam traversing the first mirror of the normal FP.\n Then absorption makes the first transmitted intensity equal to 0.028,\n\nrather than 0.030, for a 7% loss in output.\n\n  The averages over phase from 0 to 2p - that is, over one free\n\nspectral range- are important for the discussions below.\n 1 = 1 and [\n\nequation] for the normal FP pattern.  B. Equal Reflectivity Mirrors\n\nfor the Striped Fabry-Perot Interferometer \n\n  Another mode of operation for the striped FP is to use equal\n\nreflectivity mirrors.\n One can compensate for the factor of 2 in peak transmission mentioned\n\njust after Eq. ( 9) for the light that enters the stripe by using some of the\n\nlight that cannot enter the stripe.\n We normally set the angular divergence approaching the stripe just to\n\ncover four transmission peaks.\n Suppose that under this constraint the illumination cannot be made\n\nsmaller than 25 times as large as the stripe.\n = 0.96, the transmitted\n\nintensity is about the same regardless of whether  R  1 = 1.\n One problem with this mode of operation, however, is that, if any\n\nlight missing the stripe is converging toward the optical axis, some of the\n\nmultiply reflected beams may eventually exit back through the stripe.\n This creates a fringe broadening owing to the limited number of\n\nbeamlets created.\n For example, if the full width of the stripe were 0.7 mm, and the\n\nillumination 18 mm wide ( so that the intensity would be equivalent), the\n\nmirrors would effectively be only 9 mm in radius for such rays.\n\n  R\n\n = 0.96, one finds that, using Subsection IV.E on walkoff broadening for\n\nthese special rays, walkoff would degrade the finesse from 76 to 17.\n\n  One might try to set up the illumination at the stripe so that\n\nthe light diverges away from the optical axis, and reflection back through\n\nthe stripe cannot occur.\n This could be ensured by using fiber-optic transport between the\n\nreflecting target and the optics just preceding the stripe.\n Thus, when the reflecting target moves, the light entering the stripe\n\nwould not change from divergence to convergence, as it could for an\n\nair-transport system.\n\n  To ensure divergence, one would set the waist of the illumination\n\nupstream of the stripe.\n The rays at the waist of spatially incoherent illumination usually\n\nhave an angular distribution that is not significantly correlated with the\n\nradius of the ray.\n It is easy to show that the illumination at the stripe must be at\n\nleast twice the diameter of the waist to eliminate convergence\n\ncompletely.\n\n  Unfortunately, the angles of the rays entering the first mirror\n\nwould then have a correlation with position with the large radii\n\ncorresponding to large angles.\n If the illumination has a radius of 9 mm to match the transmitted\n\npower of an FP with  R  1 = 1, the outer rays hitting a 25-mm radius\n\nmirror walk less distance before vignetting.\n These rays would have a larger walk-off broadening than would an FP\n\nwith  R  1 = 1.\n Thus, unless the mirrors are large enough, attempting to obtain more\n\npower transmission by using equal reflectivity mirrors necessitates broader\n\nfringes.\n\n  There is one situation with an equal reflectivity FP that should\n\nbe avoided experimentally.\n Suppose the position of the illumination waist near the stripe is\n\nallowed to move during the dynamic experiment, as would happen with an\n\nair-transport system.\n The system 's velocity resolution would be tested with a static target\n\n( static waist position) for which we assume that all the rays diverge into\n\nthe FP.\n Then, if the waist size is only a few millimeters, the walkoff\n\nbroadening is minimal and the fringe sharpness appears to be good.\n During the dynamic motion of the target, however, the position of the\n\nwaist may move toward the striped FP and allow converging rays to enter the\n\nnonstriped region.\n Then reflections back through the stripe will occur and make the\n\nfringes significantly broader than they were compared with the initial\n\ntest. p>In summary, if the mirrors are large enough, there may be\n\nsituations where more intensity at no loss of velocity resolution results\n\nfrom using equal reflectivities.\n But for our applications this is unlikely, because it is usually\n\npossible to make the waist radius only a few millimeters.\n Also, if the waist is this small, no significant broadening will\n\noccur with equal reflectivities if divergence of the rays is ensured, but\n\nmore transmitted power would result from using  R  1 = 1.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ad03c7d2-f063-4823-8cb6-0d457e6457a4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.635732+00:00"}
{"text": "Re: The attached letter to the Faculty Council Review\n\nCommittee\n\n  I write in the sincere hope that you will be able to conduct a\n\nfull, fair, impartial, and open review of Chancellor  Price 's\n\nperformance.\n The enclosed letter, which I will send to the Faculty Council Review\n\nCommittee as soon as its membership is constituted, does not retrace \" A\n\nQuestionable Leadership: The Need for Change at UMB\"(December 8, 1992) with\n\nwhich you and your staff are already familiar.\n Instead, it draws upon my experience as a member of departmental and\n\nintercollegiate committees and of the CAS Senate so as to describe six\n\nfurther instances of Chancellor  Price 's mismanagement: ( 1)\n\nsubversion of the English Ph.D., the planning of which she and her second\n\nActing Provost had encouraged; ( 2) faulty charge and subsequent dismissal of\n\nthe Intercollegiate Committee on Undergraduate Teacher Certification and\n\nresulting waste of the committee 's and related dpartments' efforts; ( 3)\n\npunishment of independent thinking and reward of servility as evidenced in\n\nthe appointment of the CAS Acting Dean in August, 1992; ( 4) coercion of CAS\n\nfaculty and governance in college restructuring, wherein the Provost in\n\neffect becomes dean; ( 5) weak protection of faculty from anti-semitism and\n\nsexism; ( 6) through claims that faculty are ignorant of budget constraints\n\nand guilty of gender bias, self-deceptive resistance to constructive\n\ncriticism. Because these instances of mismanagement reflect the Chancellor 's\n\nadministrative character, they cannot be repaired with simple or quick\n\nefforts.\n I know it is difficult for you to face the prospect of letting go the\n\ntop female administrator in the university, but I believe you must do so.\n Thank you very much for reading my letter, which I am FAXing to your\n\noffice today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  No one is wrong all of the time.\n deserves praise for strengthening curricular\n\nand enrollment diversity and for initiating efforts at fund-raising in the\n\nprivate sector.\n But her persistent confusion of power with genuine strength has more\n\noften damaged the University.\n Instead of negotiating, she has willfully disregarded the advice she\n\nasked faculty to provide and advice governance legitimately provided.\n 's\n\nmismanagement already made familiar in \" A Questionable Leadership: The Need\n\nfor Change at UMB\" ( December 8, 1992).\n Instead, I will limit it to describing six further instances of\n\nmismanagement which prevented the University from benefiting from the work of\n\ndepartmental and intercollegiate committees and the CAS Senate on which I\n\nserved.\n\n  Subversion of the English Ph.D. in Language, Writing, and\n\nCulture: At the request of the campus administration, the English Department\n\nagreed to design a Ph.D. program.\n For several years, I served on the English Ph.D. Planning Committee.\n After extensive work, both on campus and among campuses in the\n\nnortheast, the full proposal for a Ph.D. in Language, Writing, and Culture\n\nwas presented at the June, 1991, BOT meeting.\n Enthusiasm for the proposal seemed to portend timely formal approval.\n 's actions have kept approval out of\n\nreach.\n On September 6, 1991, she asked that the proposal be put on the BOT\n\nagenda for October, 1991.\n But later she replaced it with new agenda items ( her proposals for a\n\nCollege of Science and in Engineering).\n Then she initiated a two-track Ed.D. program, one not supported by\n\nexisting faculty resources and therefore entailing great additional expense.\n invited the\n\nPh.D. Committee to meet with him, reassuring us that even though the proposal\n\nhad been accidentally omitted from the BOT agenda for 1992, he would obtain\n\nStage 2 approval very soon.\n Since December 8, 1992, when the Chair of the English Department (\n\nwho as a member of the \" Futures\" committee had criticized Chancellor \n\nPrice) and a majority of the Ph.D. planning committee signed \" A\n\nQuestionable Leadership,\" silence has deepened.\n Last fall the Chair of the English Department was informed that the\n\nproposal remains at Stage 1 for the third year.\n Meanwhile, even though our proposal has received both external and\n\ninternal praise, and neither Chancellor  Price nor Provost \n\nSellers has raised substantive questions or justified the delays , the\n\nEd.D. program-- planned after ours and costing far more-- is up and\n\nrunning.\n\n  to encourage faculty to devote the\n\nvast amount of energy and time needed to design an excellent and innovative\n\ndoctoral program like ours, to promise but continually withhold support, and\n\nthereby to subvert the program she had outwardly fostered demonstrates one\n\ninstance of managerial wastefulness if and vengeful abuse of her power.\n\n  Wasted Efforts of the Intercollegiate Committee on Undergraduate\n\nTeacher: This wild goose chase, in which I participated as a committee member\n\nfor the second of its two years' deliberations, resembles the story of the\n\nEnglish Ph.D.: ask the faculty to plan, praise the results, then dismiss the\n\nplans.\n\n\nAmin 's giving one charge and Acting Provost  Sellers 's disbanding\n\nthe committee for failing to do something else.\n I will not repeat this story of administrative carelessness that\n\ncaused some twenty committee members to waste two years' service.\n But I will add a further dimension.\n Departments like English, which were asked to contribute substantial\n\nnumbers of courses to the proposed TCP, to modify existing courses, and\n\nperhaps to recruit faculty with expertise in English and Language Arts\n\neducation-- spent agonizing months trying to figure out where the resources\n\nmight come from: how could English both serve a program it recognized as\n\nimmensely significant both to the University and to the community, maintain\n\nits commitments to Freshman English, the Core, and interdisciplinary\n\nteaching, and not sacrifice the English major?\n English was by no means the only department affected; indeed, any\n\ndepartment engaging in secondary certification had to grapple with these\n\nquestions.\n To waste the committee members' energies was bad enough, but the CUTP\n\nfiasco was multiplied throughout CAS, CPCS, and GCE.\n 's two Acting Provosts were, respectively,\n\ncareless in charging the committee and thankless in disbanding it.\n They made the waste of our energies and those of departments all the\n\nmore burdensome.\n in August,\n\n1992\n\n  's\n\nappointment of  Larry Esperanto as Acting Dean of CAS are as widely\n\nrecognized as the procedural chicanery employed to effect it.\n Again, there is no need to retrace the story here in detail.\n 's\n\ntwo choices of action demonstrated once again her confusion of power with\n\nstrength.\n Edith\n\nPlaman, who over twelve years had earned the overwhelming respect and\n\nsupport of the CAS faculty, and who as Acting Dean had defused a crisis over\n\nthe Writing Proficiency Exam with her customary fairness, graciousness, and\n\nrealistic wisdom-- and without needing to accept the Chancellor 's offer of\n\nUniversity security.\n The failure to appoint this candidate as Acting Dean in 1992 taught\n\nCAS faculty not to expect the Chancellor to reward strength, competence, and\n\nindependence.\n\n  's second choice of action taught that\n\nservility would be rewarded.\n freely, publicly, and repeatedly\n\nacknowledges that he was appointed on the condition that he deliver to\n\nChancellor  Price the restructuring of CAS.\n, was willing to override\n\nboth widespread opposition within CAS and repeated advice from Chancellor \n\nPrice 's blue-ribbon \" Futures\" Committee-- the Task Force on Natural and\n\nInformation Sciences) not to split the College.\n Having already dismissed such opposition and such advice, Chancellor\n\n Price simply wanted an Acting Dean of CAS who would obey her.\n I served on the CAS Budget and Long Range Planning Committee under\n\nActing Dean  Esperanto in 1992-93.\n He gave the committee no charge and no guidance beyond an hour-long\n\nsketch of resource allocation issues at institutions comparable to UMB.\n He was simply awaiting direction from the Chancellor 's planning\n\ncommittee.\n Another waste.\n The Faculty Council committee will already be familiar with the\n\nprotracted deliberations of the \" Futures\" and \" Back to the Futures\"\n\ncommittees mentioned in ( 3) above.\n But I must now go into rather deep detail in order to describe\n\nChancellor  Price 's persistent refusal to address governance 's\n\nobjections to restructuring CAS.\n\n \n\ncould have read \" A Questionable Leadership\" in December, 1992, and chosen to\n\nmend her managerial style so as to make it more genuinely collaborative.\n, did just\n\nthe opposite: used her power to coerce change.\n\n  As a member of the CAS Senate from September, 1992 through\n\nDecember, 1993, I witnessed Chancellor  Price 's and Acting Provost \n\nSellers 's continuing refusal to address CAS 's objections to the \n\nEsperanto plan ( \" Administrative Structure and the Administrative\n\nResponsibilities in the College of Arts and Sciences,\" December 11, 1992).\n By giving line authority to both the Science Dean and the Liberal\n\nArts Dean, both of whom would report directly to the Provost, this plan in\n\neffect made the Provost into the CAS Dean.\n Noting many problems with this plan, the CAS Senate approved a\n\ndetailed rationale and the following motion: \" It is the sense of the Senate\n\nthat the responsibilities of the Dean of Science Faculty can be and, in fact,\n\nhave been adequately carried out without line authority over buget and\n\npersonnel.\n to propose\n\nalternative administrative arrangements in consultation with department\n\nchairs, program directors, appropriate faculty and professional staff\" ( see\n\nSenate minutes for March 1, 1993, for both the rationale and the motion).\n Between March 2nd and March 10th, the CAS Senate conducted a\n\nreferendum on the  Esperanto plan; 72% of all respondents disapproved\n\nof the plan ( 88% in Arts &Humanities, 95% in Social Sciences, and 33% in\n\nNatural Sciences disapproved it).\n 's letter of transmittal\n\non March 29, 1993, not only dismissed the referendum but also inaccurately\n\nclaimed that opponents of his plan all favored the 1991 single-dean model (\n\nsee Senate minutes of April 12, 1993, and letter from Senate Moderator \n\nJohan to President  Hoover , April 14, 1993).\n\n  refused the CAS Senate Executive\n\nCommittee 's attempts to present alternatives to Acting Dean \n\nEsperanto 's lop-sided and costly plan, and he insisted that line\n\nauthority must be given to the Science Dean ( see Senate minutes of May 12,\n\n1993).\n\n\nEsperanto plan for accomplishing Chancellor  Price 's wishes, the\n\nSenate had no choice but to participate in yet another committee, the Ad Hoc\n\nCommittee on CAS Administrative Structure, working during the summer of 1993\n\n( the Senate 's motion passed by unanimous voice vote on June 16, 1993, makes\n\nclear the coercion it felt: \" ...the Senate feels compelled to participate in\n\nthis planning.\").\n The report of that Ad Hoc Committee ( September 7, 1993) very clearly\n\nspelled out its continuing reservations about the three-dean model it was\n\nproposing as merely the lesser of evils.\n In response, the CAS Senate concurred with the Ad Hoc Committee 's\n\ncritique of the three-dean model yet, again as a realistic response to\n\ncoercion by Provost  Sellers, settled for the deeply flawed model so\n\nthat dean searches could begin ( see CAS Senate minutes for September 27,\n\n1993).\n\n  The pattern is clear.\n do have the\n\npower to enforce their wishes over the protests of faculty and governance.\n And they exercise it, calling it \" strong management.\" To do this is\n\nto confuse genuine strength, which dares to negotiate and collaborate so that\n\na community can be preserved, with tyranny.\n Weak Protection of Faculty from Students' Anti-Semitism and\n\nSexism?\n\n  rightly prides herself on her commitment\n\nto diversity in the curriculum and in enrollment, but that commitment has\n\nbadly faltered when faculty members have become victims of students' attacks.\n Students and faculty deserve equally vigorous protection from\n\nharassment.\n\n  On May 12, 1993, the Faculty Council heard a disturbing report of\n\nanti-semitic attacks on  Dan Beaker, my CPCS colleague in composition.\n 's letter detailed complaints of a disgruntled\n\nstudents repeated anti-semitic letters and physical threats.\n He had promptly reported these verbal attacks, but VC Charles Desmond\n\nhad repeatedly ignored them.\n For a disturbed student to express anti-semitism is one thing, for\n\nthe university senior administration to appear to condone it through inaction\n\nis quite another.\n defended her VC 's inaction.\n The Faculty Council passed a motion expressing its dismay with the\n\nmishandling of Prof.  Beaker 's situation and demanding periodic\n\nreports of the administration 's subsequent responses to it.\n Very soon after that, an English professor suffered sexual\n\nharrassment from a student.\n This woman, a brand-new untenured faculty member in English ( who\n\nnevertheless has substantial experience teaching at urban universities in\n\nChicago and Miami), received a letter describing various sexual intentions,\n\nincluding the explicit threat, \" I will have you.\"", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "46db61bf-de09-4817-8cb4-fb5d193a48b3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.636188+00:00"}

{"text": ",\n\nsmallmouth bass  Micropterus dolomieu  , walleye  Stizostedion\n\nvitreum  , and channel catfish  Ictalurus punctatus  from John\n\nDay Reservoir were examined to determine the extent of predation on juvenile\n\nsalmonids during seaward migrations of the salmonids during April-August\n\n1983-1986.\n spp. and steelhead\n\n 0. mykiss  were the most important food group ( by weight) of\n\nnorthern squawfish - - about 67%-- but made up smaller proportions of the\n\nfood of the ether predators: channel catfish, 33%; walleyes, 14%; smallmouth\n\nbass, 4%.\n Seasonal changes in diets indicated that northern squawfish preferred\n\njuvenile salmonids in May and August ( generally the peak of salmonid\n\nout-migration), and switched to prickly sculpin  Cottus asper  when\n\nnumbers of juvenile salinonids declined; walleyes and smallmouth bass showed\n\na preference only for prickly sculpin among the prey fishes analyzed.\n As judged by dietary composition and prey selectivity, the northern\n\nsquawfish was the major fish predator on juvenile salmonids in the reservoir;\n\nchannel catfish also were important predators in the upper reservoir in\n\nspring.\n Walleyes and smallmouth bass were much less important predators on\n\nsalmonids, and appeared to select subyearling chinook salmon only in August\n\nwhen the distribution of this prey overlapped with that of the predators.\n Size-selective predation by northern squawfish may also play an\n\nimportant role in reducing survival of the smaller individuals within each\n\nrun of out-migrating juvenile salmonids.\n\n  A complex of factors that included overfishing, watershed\n\ndisruption, and dam building contributed to the decline of salmonid fisheries\n\nin the Columbia River.\n Historically, the Columbia River system was the greatest producer of\n\nchinook salmon  Oncorhynchus tshawytscha  and steelhead  0.\n\nmykiss  in the world ( Stone 1878; Evans 1977).\n Declines of the salmonid spawning runs were not apparent until the\n\nboom period of the canning industry in the late 1800s, although the runs were\n\nstill substantial in the early 1930s ( Craig and Hacker 1940; NPPC 1984).\n During 1928-1932, about 3,820 commercial fishermen ( not including\n\nIndians) harvested an average annual catch of about 13.5 million kilograms\n\nfrom Columbia River stocks, exclusive of ocean catches; the catch of all\n\nsalmon and steelhead in 1933 was about 11.8 million kilograms ( Craig and\n\nHacker 1940).\n The Northwest Power Planning Council ( NPPC) adopted a salmonid run\n\nestimate of 10 to 16 million adults in the Columbia River system before any\n\ndams were built ( NPFC 1986); and Chapman ( 1986) estimated 7.5 million (\n\nneither estimate included harvest by Indians).\n Total runs of salmonid adults were about 2.5 million fish in the mid\n\n1980s, as judged by counts at dams ( Chapman 1986).\n\n  Construction of dams for hydropower, flood control, and\n\nirrigation, combined with the effects of overfishing, logging, grazing,\n\nfarming, and mining, caused drastic reductions in Columbia River salmon and\n\nsteelhead populations ( Craig and Hacker 1940; NPPC 1984).\n From 1933, when the first main-stem dam was completed, to 1975 ( when\n\nthe last of 28 dams composing the Federal Columbia River Power System was\n\ncompleted) the annual commercial catch of salmon declined from about 9.5 to 3\n\nmillion kilograms.\n More than half of the accessible natural spawning habitat was lost (\n\nNPPC 1984).\n The dams impeded or blocked upstream spawning migrations of adults,\n\naltered the river 's dimensions, flows, and temperatures, and increased the\n\nmortality of juveniles as they migrated back to the sea ( Raymond 1968;\n\nTrefethen 1972; Schwiebert 1977).\n Mortality of juvenile salmonids has been increased because of\n\ndiseases introduced from hatchery stocks ( developed to rehabilitate runs),\n\ngas bubble disease from nitrogen supersaturation at dam spills, delayed\n\nmigrations and asynchronous smoltification, direct mortality from dam\n\nturbines, and increased predation ( Raymond 1968, 1969, 1979; Bently and\n\nRaymond 1976; Ebel and Raymond 1976; Ebel 1977; Rosentreter 1977; Weitkamp\n\nand Katz 1980; Zaugg et al. 1985). \n\n  Predator-prey relations, the subject of this and subsequent\n\npapers in this issue ( Beamesderfer and Rieman 1991; Rieman et al. 1991; Vigg\n\net al. 1991), have been altered by dams in several ways.\n The relatively still reservoirs behind dams disorient juvenile\n\nsalmonids, slow their out-migrations, and expose the fish to high\n\ntemperatures.\n At the dams, fish become concentrated near spillways or other passage\n\nroutes and endure considerable stress as they pass to the tailrace below.\n All these factors can affect the vulnerability of young salmonids to\n\npredation.\n The magnitude of predation has been difficult to measure, but\n\nRuggerone ( 1986) estimated that ring-billed gulls  Larus delawarensis\n\n consumed about 2% of tile peak spring migration of juvenile salmonids\n\nbelow Wanapum Dam, Columbia River. \n\n  The northern squawfish ( see Table 1 for scientific and common\n\nnames of fish mentioned herein), the prevalent endemic piscivore in the\n\nColumbia River system, has caused substantial depletions of juvenile\n\nsalmonids in various waters ( Ricker 1941; Jeppson and Platts 1959; Thompson\n\n1959; Thompson and Tufts 1967).\n In Lake Washington, which has several species in common with those in\n\nColumbia River reservoirs, northern squawfish are opportunistic feeders that\n\nprey both on limnetic and benthic-littoral fishes ( Eggers et al.,1978).\n They feed primarily on the most abundant resident prey species,\n\nprickly sculpin, except during seasonally high abundances of the predominant\n\nplanktivore, juvenile sockeye salmon.\n Brown and Moyle ( 1981), who reviewed the impact of squawfish\n\npredation on salmonids, indicated that predation may be substantial in lakes\n\nbut not in streams except near dams, water divisions, or other artificial\n\ndisruptions of flow.\n They also concluded that additional studies on squawfish feeding were\n\nneeded, especially on the effects of dams and water diversions on predation\n\nduring out-migrations of salmonid juveniles. \n\n\n\n  Northern squawfish have become more abundant in the Columbia\n\nRiver with the development of reservoirs and other predator species - -\n\nwalleyes, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass-- have been introduced there.\n These predators are relatively abundant and feed on forage fishes in\n\nother areas ( e.g., Stevens 1959; Wagner 1972; Johnson and Hale 1977; Knight\n\net al. 1984).\n Maule and Horton ( 1984) documented that walleyes eat young salmonids\n\nin the Columbia River, but concluded that the impact of predation could not\n\nbe assessed without fish population estimates.\n\n  In 1982, the Bonneville Power Administration funded studies,\n\nconducted jointly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Oregon\n\nDepartment of Fish and Wildlife, to quantify the effect of fish predation on\n\nout-migrating juvenile salmonids in John Day Reservoir in the Columbia River.\n Four aspects of predation were studied during 1982-1986: ( 1) feeding\n\necology, ( 2) consumption rates by predators, ( 3) abundance and distribution\n\nof predators, and ( 4) total effect of predation on the mortality of\n\nout-migrating juvenile salmonids.\n The major findings of these studies are reported in four companion\n\npapers of which this is the first.\n Here we document the feeding ecology of northern squawfish, walleyes,\n\nsmallmouth bass, and channel catfish in John Day Reservoir, quantifying the\n\ndiets of these four predators temporally and spatially, and evaluating\n\npredation dynamics with respect to out-migrations of juvenile salmonids.\n\n\n  John Day Dam was built in 1968 at Columbia River kilometer 347 (\n\nmeasured from the mouth); it is the third dam upstream from the ocean (\n\nFigure 1).\n It forms John Day Reservoir, which is 123 km long and extends to\n\nMcNary Dam.\n John Day Reservoir has a mean elevation of 89 m above mean sea level,\n\na mean width of 1.8 km, a mean depth of 8.0 m, a maximum depth of 44.2 m, a\n\nsurface area of about 21,040 million hectares, and a capacity of about 3 x\n\nl0~ m3 ( U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, unpublished data).\n Discharges from McNary Dam are generally highest ( about 64,000 m3Is)\n\nin April and lowest in November.\n Water residence time varies directly with flow, because there is\n\nlittle storage capacity.\n\n  Temperature ranges from 0 to 27(C; it is usually lowest in\n\nFebruary and highest in August.\n Partial thermal stratification occurs in summer; the reservoir is\n\nconsidered to be polymictic.\n On the basis of nutrients and primary production, John Day Reservoir\n\nmaybe categorized as mesotrophic ( Hjort et al. 1981).\n\n\n  The fishes of John Day Reservoir comprise 34 resident and\n\nanadromous species ( U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, unpublished data).\n The spawning migration of adult anadromous salmonids passing John Day\n\nDam and entering the reservoir during 1983-1986 was composed of 27%\n\nsteelhead, 50% chinook salmon, 20% sockeye salmon, and 4% coho salmon; these\n\nproportions have been similar since the dam was closed in 1968 ( U.S. Army\n\nCorps of Engineers 1986).\n\n  Hatchery production of anadromous salmonids upstream from McNary\n\nDam ( mid-Columbia and Snake rivers) during 1983-1986 averaged a 35 million\n\nfish per year, composed of the following species ( in percent): fall chinook\n\nsalmon, spring chinook salmon, 33.1; summer chinook salmon, 6.4; coho salmon,\n\n1.4; and steelhead, ( Fish Passage Center 1986).\n ( Spring, summer fall stocks are named for the season in which a\n\nreturn to the river.) Spring chinook salmon, and sockeye salmon, and\n\nsteelhead generally migrate as yearlings, whereas summer and fall chinook\n\nsalmon out-migrate as subyearlings.\n Natural reproduction of fall chinook salmon, primarily in the\n\nfree-flowing Hanford Reach above McNary Reservoir, is relatively high.\n On the basis of the \" passage index\" ( dam counts adjusted by flow),\n\njuvenile emigrants at McNary Dam are 34.60, chinook salmon yearlings, 40.8%\n\nchinook salmon subyearlings, 1.7% coho salmon, 10.3% sockeye salmon, and\n\n12.6% steelhead ( Fish Passage Center 1986).\n Juvenile salmonids emigrate from April to August; most subyearling\n\nchinook salmon migrate in July, and the peak migrations of the other groups\n\nare in May ( Figure 2). \n\n\n  - -\n Diets of predators were monitored from 1983 to 1986 at five locations\n\nin Day Reservoir ( Figure 1; Table 2).\n Two stations - - the McNary Dam tailrace ( river kilometers 463-470)\n\nand the area near the dam face from v boats are restricted ( here termed \"\n\nrestricted zone,\" km 470-470.5)-- were areas influenced by turbine outflow\n\nand spill.\n Irrigon ( km 444-458) was a transitional zone but was mostly similar\n\nto the tailrace area.\n Arlington ( km 387-399), the reservoir station, typified habitats\n\naway from direct influence of dams.\n The John Day forebay station ( km 347-354) was an area where juvenile\n\nsalmonids sometimes concentrate before they pass the dam.\n\n\n  Predators were sampled monthly at each station on a diel schedule\n\n( four consecutive 6-h PC each day for at least three consecutive days) from\n\nApril through August each year ( but no July samples were collected in 1983\n\nand 1984).\n In 1986, the restricted zone station was sampled every other week\n\nfrom April through August; all other stations were sampled only in July.\n Although the sampling design was not consistent and balanced within\n\nor among years ( Table 2), all combinations of locations and months were\n\ncovered over the 4 years.\n Because of this broad coverage and because predator diets turned out\n\nto be temporally and spatially consistent from year to year, we pooled data\n\nor used averages across months, years, or stations to increase sample sizes\n\nwithout substantially sacrificing accuracy.\n Predators were collected primarily with a boat electroshocker.\n However, a semiballoon bottom trawl ( 9-rn headrope) and\n\nmultifilament bottom gill nets measuring 60 x 1.8 m with meshes ( stretched\n\nmeasure) of 8.9, 10.2, 12.7, or 15.2cm were used for 1-h sets at all stations\n\nexcept John Day forebay to collect walleyes and channel catfish.\n\n  - -\n Living predaceous fishes were anesthestized with benzocaine, weighed\n\nto the nearest gram, and measured ( fork length) to the nearest millimeter.\n Stomachs of small-mouth bass longer than 100 mm and walleyes longer\n\nthan 200 mm were pumped with a modified Seaburg sampler ( Seaburg 1957) to\n\nobtain stomach contents; the fish were then released.\n Entire digestive tracts were removed from channel catfish and\n\nnorthern squawfish longer than 250 mm; smallmouth bass shorter than 100 mm,\n\nwalleyes shorter than 200 mm, and northern squawfish shorter than 250 mm were\n\npreserved whole.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0859d6aa-e891-4a5e-8b2a-14b9dd3b8225", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.638453+00:00"}

where everybody she knew was\n\nwhite and Christian.\n Marty lived in a Jewish section of the San Fernando Valley in\n\nCalifornia.\n His school was so Jewish-dominated that the team chant was \" Hit 'em\n\nin the kischkes!\"At some point during their courtship, which began during\n\ntheir days at a less segregated high school, my mother decided to convert to\n\nJudaism.\n And so she did several years later, studying Jewish history and\n\nculture with a reform rabbi and professor at UCLA where she was attending\n\ncollege.\n But her ethnic transformation, although legal under reform Jewish law,\n\nwould never be complete.\n To my father 's parents, she was still an interloper.\n It was as if Christianity were written into her very DNA, as\n\nunchangeable as blue eyes and blonde hair.\n And, I must admit, I have never thought of her as Jewish either.\n\n\n  So I have come to be an ethnic hybrid: half-WASP, half-Jew, the\n\nproduct of two supposedly segregated identities.\n Such a condition lends itself easily to jokes.\n If you combine my heritage with that of my partner, you get one Jew\n\nand one Christian.\n If you combine my heritage with my partner and our friends up the\n\nstreet, you get 1.2 Jews, 2 British, .5 Scots-Irish, .5 Italian, .01 African\n\nAmerican, and of course the inevitable imaginary .0001 Native American.\n\n  What this tongue-in-cheek laundry list of ethnicities manages to\n\nexplain--in a quite serious way--is the extent to which all racial identities\n\nare already hopelessly miscegenated.\n Nevertheless, the terms \" race\" and \" ethnicity\" grow out of the\n\nold-fashioned idea that there are measurable, anatomical differences between\n\nsuch groups that make them obviously distinct.\n Even \" multiculturalism,\" a concept which suggests racial plurality,\n\ntakes for granted that racial groups can co-exist peacefully only by\n\nmaintaining cultural separations and particularities.\n But I would argue that the \" multiculture\" might more aptly be\n\nunderstood as a series of cultures that are being experienced all at once,\n\noften in a single individual or group.\n The racial logic of multiculturalism should be conceived of as \"\n\nmultiple and hybridizing,\" not as \" separate and plural.\"To acknowledge\n\nthis, in my opinion, would simply be to admit what we've known all along 'vep>\n\n\n  Fetishes are only symbols, highly compacted stories that\n\nsubliminally signal their fuller meanings.\n\n\n  For my parents' and grandparents' generation, being Jewish meant\n\nbeing part of \" the Jewish race.\"They were part of a not-quite-white\n\nracial category, caught between assimilating into dominant WASP culture and\n\nfinding themselves cast out of it.\n Although most Eastern European Jews could \" pass\" as white, their\n\nreligious and cultural heritage made them a breed apart, a group that would\n\nhave to be taught the ways of American Christianity ( implicitly, American\n\nwhiteness) whether they liked it or not.\n Although my father 's elementary school was 99 percent Jewish, they\n\nwere forced to have a Christmas pageant every year.\n My mother 's parents called Jews \" clannish,\" accusing them memorably\n\nof \" eating greasy food.\"Telling me this story, my mother bursts out\n\nlaughing.\n \" A Southerner saying that someone else ate greasy food!\" she snorts,\n\nstill incredulous after more than three decades.\n \" I'm always amazed t 'mt Marty was able to like me,\" she adds, \"\n\nbecause he hated Christians so much.\"Once, when they were first dating, my\n\nmother referred to Brazil nuts by the only name she knew, a name she had\n\nlearned in Texas: nigger toes.\n\n\n  I used to ask them all the time what brought them together into\n\nthe unlikely union that made me.\n It all came down to a sandwich.\n \" I saw Marty eating these gigantic sandwiches for lunch.\n I'd only ever 'dd these white bread sandwiches, with one slice of\n\nmeat and mayonnaise.\n Maybe there would be a layer of lettuce, but I don't think so.\n I had to find out why this guy was eating such huge\n\nsandwiches.?It 's so American, that fetishization of the \" other\" through\n\nfood.\n We avoid thinking about the way \" difference\" often means \"\n\nsubjugation\" by trying to convert social identity into tasty, consumable\n\nobjects.\n Foreign identities become synonymous with the restaurants immigrants\n\nbuild ( or through their simulation).\n\n\n  But my mother was consumed.\n\n\n  \" I had always assumed, not knowing that there could be any other\n\nalternative, that Marty would convert to Christianity,\" she explains to me as\n\nmy father watches her from across the room.\n\n  \" But I would never have done that.\n Never,\" he cuts in, \" That just wasn't an option.\n\n\n  \" But why did you want to be Jewish?\" I ask Cynthia.\n\n\n  \" Yes, my family was very narrow-minded.\n Jews seemed cosmopolitan, sophisticated.\n In Marty

thought that since I was a Jew, I must be a\n\ncommunist,\" my father remarks dryly.\n\n  \" So you didn't want to be part of a group like that,\" I turn\n\nback to my mother.\n\n  \" No, and I didn't

\" Well no, I never thought of that,\" she replies, giggling.\n Then, seriously, \" But I feel like a Jew, as if I have more in common\n\nwith Jews.\n People see me as Jewish.\n Maybe being Jewish did allow me to see my own culture, Southern\n\nChristian culture, as somewhat alien.\n\n\n  My partner enters the conversation.\n \" People would definitely think you are a Jew,\" he says, \" most Jews\n\nwould.\"\n\n  It 's true.\n Cynthia has been Jewish for more of her life than she has been white.\n I, on the other hand, have been white and Jewish for exactly the same\n\namount of time.\n In fact, I have been white and Jewish simultaneously.\n One could argue that such an experience is the very essence of being\n\nJewish in the United States today, especially if you have pale skin and blue\n\neyes like I do.\n Looking at me, and many Jews, most people would think \" white\" rather\n\nthan \" Jew.\"Yet the not-quite-whiteness of being Jewish has never gone\n\naway.\n When I declare myself Jewish, or part-Jewish, people do respond to me\n\ndifferently.\n Because being Jewish is not usually something people see immediately,\n\nthey can't prejudge me they way they would an African-American or\n\nAsian-American.\n But once they know that I'm Jewish, ma 'm of their preconceptions\n\nshift, and I seem suddenly strange.\n They have to gather more data to feel comfortable.\nThen\n\nthere 's my favorite, \" Do you speak Jewish?\"I wouldn't describe any of\n\nthese questions as anti-Semitic, only as indicative of the way being Jewish\n\nsomehow marks you as \" other,\" as needing some kind of an explanation.\n When you're whit 'reit 's far more rare that you're ask 'reto explain\n\nyour identity.\n Most people don't regard whiteness as a race, only as the absence of\n\nit.\n However wrongheaded this attitude may be, it 's the kind of \" common\n\nsense\" that constitutes our first impressions of one another.\n\n\n  I go out to breakfast with my partner 's family in Long Beach.\n His grandmother Dorothy, from the Jewish side of his family, is there\n\nwith her boyfriend, Charles.\n\n\n  \" I'm fro 'mWilliamsburg.\n Do you know it?\" Charles asks me.\n I don't.\n He is shocked, then amused.\n\n\n  \" C'mon 'marles, they don't know about that,\" Dorothy teases him.\n But I'm in 'mrested; I'm al 'mys interested to hear about the past.\n\n\n  \" My father wanted me to be a rabbi; he was very religious,\"\n\nCharles says, \" But I rebelled because I wanted to be an engineer.\"I try\n\nto imagine a scenario in which a Jew becoming an engineer would constitute\n\nrebellion.\n It 's like watching someone eat a sandwich stuffed with some bizarre\n\nform of vegetable.\n\n\n  \" Wasn't it hard for Jews to get into college in those days?\n\nDidn't they screen you to make sure they weren't admitting too many Jews?\" I\n\nask, remembering my Ethnic Studies courses.\n\n  \" Yes, that 's what they did,\" Charles says, \" so I became a\n\nteacher.\"\n\n  Several months later, we go out to dinner with them in Los\n\nAngeles.\n Charles and Dorothy have just been to see me give a book reading in\n\nwhich I talk about whiteness, and stereotypes of whiteness.\n\n  \" I never had to deal with white people when I was growing up,\"\n\nCharles says.\n \" It was Williamsburg.\n Do you know it?\" He looks at me.\n\n\n  \" Yes, I know Williamsburg.\n What you had to deal with was really horrible,\" I say, referring to\n\nanti-Semitism in the early twentieth century.\n But in retrospect, I realize what I'v 'veaid is ambiguous.\n Charles takes me to mean that growing up in a restrictive Orthodox\n\nenvironment was horrible.\n\n\n\n\n  I think I must have tried, like every kid, to imitate my\n\nparents' relationship.\n When I started dating, I developed a predilection for people who\n\ncame from a biracial or biethnic background.\n I also dated outside my race, usually ending up with\n\nAsian-Americans, who enjoy the dubious privilege of having inherited the \"\n\nmodel minority\" label once reserved for Jews.\n My first true love was Korean-American, and I was his ultimate \"\n\nother.\"His Christian, traditional parents were more than a little\n\nreluctant to allow their only son to date a Jewish white girl.\nWhen I came to visit\n\nhis family once, I was filled with shame when I awkwardly took off my shoes\n\ninside the door, nearly stumbling in my effort to demonstrate cultural\n\nsympathy.\n What was ridiculous was that I took off my shoes to enter my own\n\nhouse.\n I did it every day.\n And when we visited my parents' friends' houses, we did the\n\nsame--Asian customs were ordinary to me.\n But I felt suddenly, stupidly white in that long-ago boyfriend 's\n\nhouse.\n I was an invader, a son-stealer, grubby-fingered and clumsy.\n Later that same year, his older sister, a church-going woman, came\n\nhome late one night to find him in bed with me.\n That clinched it.\n\n\n  Being Jewish was easy compared to that.\n It made me interesting, gave me a special angle on things.\n I knew how stupid Christmas was several years before the other kids\n\nknew it.\n As a Jew, I could do things in the name of Judaism that would have\n\ngotten someone else in trouble.\n I gave a book report to my ninth grade class on Philip Roth 's novel\n\nThe Ghost Writer, about a young man who is sexually obsessed with Anne Frank.\n Dressed as \" the writer,\" I read a long soliloquy from the novel\n\nwhich praised the erotic magnetism of a dead girl, the seductiveness of the\n\nultimate Jewish victim.\n What kind of teacher would risk forbidding me to read erotica out\n\nloud to a ninth grade class when I was doing it for Judaism? Anti-Semitism\n\nwas not allowed at my high school, at least not out in the open.\n Once some boys in the hallway yelled, \" Dirty Jew!\" at me during\n\nlunch.\n I wheeled around, glowered, and screamed \" FUCK YOU!\" at the top of\n\nmy lungs, giving them the finger too, just for good measure.\n A teacher tried to upbraid me for yelling obscenities in the hall.\n \" They called me a DIRTY JEW!\" I said.\n \" But is that how you should respond?\" he asked condescendingly.\n\n\n  When I think about race, fucking--even the word \" fuck\"--just\n\nseem to come to mind.\n And I think of family, which most psychologists would agree is a\n\nfairly typical connection to make.\n My sense of my own racial identity always comes back to my parents'\n\nmiscegenated romance, which has isolated our family from their families for\n\nmost of my life.\n Fucking, and worse, breeding, is what made their union scary during\n\nthe early 1960s.\n Although there were other conflicts between my parents and their\n\nfamilies, I know--having seen the way those purebloods looked at me, the\n\nmutant offspring of Jews and hicks--that they were disturbed by what I might\n\nrepresent.\n I was the hybrid corruption of their own segregated cultures, proof\n\nthat Jews and whites could mate and even produce something pretty, something\n\nsmart, something that could yell \" FUCK YOU!\" and not be sorry at all.\n I was the living embodiment of their racial and sexual\n\ntransgression.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a2fa16bf-af3b-460e-9ce7-f6052931559c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.639763+00:00"}
{"text": "1.\n How does one develop a personal ethical position or stance, that is,\n\ndecide what to do in a particular situation?\n What sources of information, guidance, and resources are available to\n\nassist one in this process?\n Describe an ethical decision making process; how and when would one\n\nuse it? \n\n  One develops a personal ethical position by not just consulting\n\nand abiding by a written code of ethics but by considering one 's own values.\n Because codes of ethics cannot possibly prescribe exactly how\n\ncounselors should act in every situation, counselors must rely on their own\n\nsense of personal ethics to help them make sound ethical decisions.\n Certain ethics, called mandatory ethics, comprise the minimal\n\nstandards by which counselors should abide.\n Principle ethics help one decide what to do in certain situations.\n Principle ethics are based on moral principles and should always be\n\nconsidered when making ethical decisions.\n They are based on Kitchener 's five moral principles that are\n\ngenerally valued in our society: autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence,\n\njustice, and fidelity ( Herlihy & Corey, 2006).\n All counselors should abide by the moral principles that all clients\n\nhave the right to make their own decisions, counselors should never harm\n\ntheir clients, counselors should promote growth and good mental health in\n\ntheir clients, counselors should treat all clients with fairness, and\n\ncounselors should always abide by their promises and honor the commitments\n\nthey make to their clients.\n\n  Beyond principle ethics, by which all counselors should abide,\n\ncounselors can hold even higher personal ethical standards for themselves.\n Called virtue ethics, these ethics focus on who the counselor is as a\n\nperson.\n One develops virtue ethics by asking, \" Who am I as a person and\n\ncounselor?\" and by examining one 's personal character traits and virtues.\n Counselors who aspire to always consider virtue ethics when making\n\nethical decisions utilize principle ethics as well as consider their own\n\nemotions.\n This involves self-awareness and self-reflection.\n Virtue ethics include: discernment or prudence, respectfulness,\n\nintegrity, self-awareness, acknowledgement of the role of emotion, and\n\nconnectedness with the community.\n Aspiring to abide by the very highest standards of ethical conduct by\n\nutilizing these virtue ethics helps counselors make more culturally sensitive\n\nethical decisions.\n When faced with a complex ethical dilemma, counselors can use virtue\n\nethics to help them decide the best course of action.\n\n  Counselors should consult a code of ethics to help them make\n\nsound ethical decisions.\n Counselors can use the American Counseling Association 's ( ACA) Code\n\nof Ethics ( 2005) as well as the code of ethics in their specialty, if one\n\nexists.\n Professional school counselors should consult both the ACA Code of\n\nEthics and the American School Counselor Association 's ( ASCA) Ethical\n\nStandards for School Counselors ( 2004).\n These are both based on Kitchener 's moral principles, but the ASCA 's\n\ncode addresses ethical standards specific to the school setting and should be\n\nused for handling ethical dilemmas in this realm.\n Codes of ethics provide guidelines for best practices, promote the\n\nvalues held by the members of the counseling profession, and are used for\n\naccountability purposes.\n These codes of ethics detail the ethical responsibilities counselors\n\nhave to their clients, students, colleagues, and themselves.\n\n  Professional school counselors should also consult with\n\nsupervisors and colleagues when faced with an ethical dilemma.\n They do this to find out the current standards of practice so that\n\nthey can make decisions consistent with these standards.\n When counselor have an ethical dilemma, it is important that they\n\nconsult with supervisors and colleagues in addition to consulting the\n\nappropriate code of ethics for guidance.\n They should document all of these actions in order to protect and\n\ndefend themselves, should they be sued by clients.\n\n  Professional school counseling can also contact the ACA Ethics\n\nand Professional Standards Department if they have an ethical dilemma.\n Staff in this department offer free consultation related to ethical\n\ndilemmas five days a week.\n This is a valuable resource for professional school counselors,\n\nespecially if they are in need of immediate guidance and support and cannot\n\nreach their county 's school counseling supervisor.\n\n  Counselors should also use an ethical decision-making model when\n\nfaced with a complex ethical dilemma in which they are unsure of how to act.\n There are several ethical decision-making models available to help\n\ncounselors when faced with complex situations in which there are no clear\n\nguidelines regarding how to respond.\n Both ACA and ASCA have developed ethical decision-making models, and\n\nother self-test models can be used as well.\n These models help counselors identify the problem and work through\n\nseveral steps to help decide how to respond.\n Following an ethical decision-making model helps counselors make\n\nreasoned, informed decisions rather than acting hastily or irresponsibly in\n\nthe absence of set standards regarding how to act in certain situations.\n This process involves reflection and consultation, and the steps\n\nshould be documented for accountability purposes.\n\n  In their book, the ACA Ethical Standards Casebook ( 2006),\n\nHerlihy and Corey recommend following ten steps to making ethical decisions.\n Step one involves identifying the problem and collecting information.\n Steps two and three involve consulting the relevant and appropriate\n\ncode of ethics and considering which of Kitchener 's five moral principles\n\napply to the situation.\n Step four is to consult with one 's supervisor and colleagues to help\n\ndetermine the standard of practice for this situation.\n Step five is to consider one 's own emotions because these may impede\n\none 's current judgment and ability to make decisions.\n Step six is to involve the client in making the decision so that he\n\ncan offer his input and wishes.\n Steps seven and eight involve identifying desired outcomes and\n\nconsidering all of one 's options and the consequences and implications of\n\neach.\n Once one determines which action one will take, step nine urges one\n\nto review the selected action and apply the tests of justice, publicity, and\n\nuniversality to it.\n If it does not cause any new ethical issues, one should move to step\n\nten and implement the decided upon action. <.h>\n 2.\n Discuss the specific ethical and legal issues concerning counseling\n\nminors in school settings.\n\n\n  Because the clients are minors, there are several ethical and\n\nlegal issues surrounding counseling students in a school setting.\n According to ASCA 's Ethical Standards for School Counselors ( 2004),\n\nthe professional school counselor 's primary obligation is to the student,\n\nalthough complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.\n When counseling minors in a school setting, confidentiality can and\n\nshould be breached if a student indicates plans to hurt him/herself or\n\nothers, if a student reports abuse or if the counselor suspects the child is\n\nbeing abused or neglected, and if the counselor 's records are subpoenaed by a\n\ncourt ( the professional school counselor is forced to comply if she also\n\nreceives a court order).\n In these cases, the professional school counselor has to break\n\nconfidentiality, but he should communicate and discuss this with the student\n\nbeforehand.\n According to section B.2.a. of the ACA Code of Ethics ( 2005), the\n\ncounselor can break confidentiality to disclose information in order to\n\nprotect the client.\n The professional school counselor should make every effort to include\n\nthe student and family ( except in cases of abuse) in decision making.\n\n  Professional school counselors have to follow several laws when\n\nworking with minors in a school system.\n Based on the Tarasoff case of 1974, the counselor has a \" duty to\n\nwarn\" when she suspects that someone is in danger of being harmed ( Linde,\n\n2007).\n In many states, this is now both an ethical and legal duty.\n In the case of HIV/AIDS, however, professional school counselors in\n\nMaryland do not have a right to know if students are infected and have a\n\nlegal duty not to share this information with others.\n The decision of Eisel v.\n Board of Education of Montgomery County in 1991 now requires\n\nprofessional school counselors to call students' legal guardians and inform\n\nschool administrators if they suspect or learn directly from a student that\n\nthe student is considering committing suicide.\n All school personnel also have a legal duty to report suspected abuse\n\nor neglect.\n If a counselor finds out that a student has committed an illegal act\n\nor run away from home, the counselor has a legal right to notify the\n\nadministration in the former case, and the parent or guardian in the latter\n\ncase ( unless abuse is suspected).\n\n  Professional school counselors must also be aware of and uphold\n\nminor consent laws, which vary from state to state.\n In many states, students seeking treatment for substance abuse,\n\ncontraception, prenatal care, and treatment for sexually transmitted\n\ninfections can do so without parental knowledge or consent.\n Abortion laws pertaining to minors vary widely from state to state.\n School counselors have a legal obligation to follow not only state\n\nlaws but also local and school policies when working with minors, so they\n\nneed to be aware of these.\n\n  In all schools that receive funding from the U.S. Department of\n\nEducation, student records must be kept in accordance with the Family\n\nEducational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 ( Buckley Amendment).\n School counselors must abide by this law and cannot share any part of\n\na student 's school record ( information pertaining to grades, attendance,\n\nassessments, behavior, health records) with a non-legal guardian (\n\nnon-custodial parents have rights unless these have been terminated by a\n\ncourt), and should not access students' records themselves unless they are\n\ndirectly working with those students.\n Personal notes about minors are not part of the school record and\n\nshould be in a private, secure location.\n\n  Professional school counselors should also respect the rights and\n\nwishes of parents and legal guardians and should try to collaborate with them\n\nwhen possible.\n Because parents and legal guardians have a legal right to know what\n\nthe professional school counselor discusses with minor students, the\n\nprofessional school counselor should explain the importance of\n\nconfidentiality and trust with the guardians, according to section B.5.b. of\n\nthe ACA Code of Ethics ( 2005).\n If legal guardians request more information related to their child 's\n\ncounseling, professional school counselors may disclose minimal information\n\nor set up a meeting among the student, parent, and themselves to discuss the\n\ncounseling relationship.\n If this still does not satisfy the guardians and the student refuses\n\nto share this information with them, the counselor will have to break\n\nconfidentiality to tell the parents information shared during counseling.\n Although minors have an ethical right to confidentially in\n\ncounseling, their legal guardians have legal rights to know what occurs in\n\ncounseling, unless the child has been legally emancipated.\n\n  If I were a professional school counselor and a student came in\n\nand told me this, the first step I would take would be to conduct a lethality\n\nassessment to see if she has devised a suicide plan.\n I would ask questions such as, \" How long have you been thinking\n\nabout this?,\" \" Do you have a plan?,\" \" Have you thought about how you would\n\ndo it?,\" and \" Have you thought about when you would do it?\" to assess the\n\nimmediacy of the risk.\n I would take our conversation very seriously because her comments\n\nindicate that she is depressed, has developed an eating disorder, has low\n\nself-esteem, cuts herself, and has been doing poorly academically.\n These are all serious warning signs.\n I would encourage her to explore her feelings and might ask her to\n\ncomplete a \" Life Contract,\" in which she will promise not to harm herself\n\nfor a certain amount of time.\n\n  I would explain that I have to tell her parents in order to\n\nprotect her.\n Section A.2.a. of ASCA 's Ethical Standards for School Counselors\n\nexplains, among other responsibilities when beginning a relationship, the\n\nethical duty to discuss confidentiality and its limits to clients ( 2004).\n Even if she said her parents already knew about her suicidal\n\nthoughts, I would tell her that I have a duty to warn them.\n Following section A.7.b. of the Ethical Standards for School\n\nCounselors, I would offer the student the opportunity to tell her parents\n\nwith me and would try to accommodate her wishes regarding how we tell her\n\nparents.\n By law, I would have a \" duty to warn\" her parents.\n The ruling of the Eisel case resulted in a Maryland law regarding\n\nprofessional school counselors' duty to warn parents if they have any reason\n\nto suspect that their child is suicidal.\n In this case, I have heard it directly from the student herself, and\n\nher comments must be taken very seriously.\n I would follow my district 's procedures for handling potential\n\nsuicide.\n I would call her parents and strongly urge them to take her to the\n\nhospital or to a psychiatrist for a psychiatric evaluation.\n Depending on the seriousness and imminence of the threat, which I\n\nwould gauge by further conversation with the student, I might ask that a\n\nparent come and pick her up immediately.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6adcb56f-efb5-40b4-ac1c-44c3e46fdccf", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.641194+00:00"}
{"text": "Memories of old days at Keanae School come to the fore as reunion\n\nnears\n\n  KEANAE - One vivid memory Helen Nakanelua has about Keanae School\n\nis her teacher coming to the school on a horse.\n\n  At age 89, Nakanelua has been holding on to the memory for a long\n\ntime.\n She acknowledges that she is one of the oldest living people who\n\nattended the little school on the isolated stretch of the East Maui\n\ncoastline.\n\n  Nakanelua said she still can still picture teacher Maggie Soon\n\narriving on a horse wearing her riding skirt.\n\n  Marc Aquino remembers the benefits of a small school when he\n\nattended Keanae School in the 1960s.\n\n  \" What I really liked about it is you get the full attention from\n\nyour teachers,\" said Aquino, who now resides in Kahului. \n\n  There were about 30 students when he attended, with classes for\n\n1st through 8th grades but just two teachers assigned to handle all of the\n\ngrades in just two classrooms. \n\n  Former Keanae School students, teachers, administrators and past\n\nand present Keanae and Wailuanui residents will be recalling all that and\n\nmore at the Keanae School Reunion 2001.\n\n  The reunion is to be held July 28 and will include a luau at noon\n\nin the Keanae Congregational Church Hall.\n Organizers estimate around 1,000 people plan to attend, which would\n\nbe roughly 10 times the resident population of the Wailua-Keanae community\n\ntoday. \n\n  Chairman Clement Kock-Wah joked, \" I kind of started all of this\n\nmess up.\"\n Kock-Wah, who grew up working in the taro patches of Keanae and\n\nattended the school in the 1940s, said, \" I want to give back to the older\n\npeople.\" \n\n  Kock-Wah also lived on Oahu and around Maui but eventually came\n\nback to Keanae.\n\n\n  He said that for awhile he talked and shared ideas about the\n\nreunion, which most thought was a good idea, and then he finally \" took the\n\nbull by the horns.\" \n\n \n\n \n\n  He said he wants to thank that \" handful of people,\" including\n\nfriends outside of Keanae and kupuna who donated materials and money.\n\n \n\n  \" I thought it was something really great.\n It took Clement Kock-Wah to put Keanae on the map again,\" she\n\nsaid.\n\n  The first school was near the Keanae Congregational Church on the\n\nKeanae peninsula, according to historical reports filed with a nomination\n\nform to place the school building on the National Register of Historic\n\nPlaces. \n\n  In 1909, as the result of a land exchange, the school moved to\n\nthe present site on Hana Highway.\n The new schoolhouse was completed in 1912 by contractor Hugh Howell.\n\n\n\n  Through the years, the population of the region has dwindled, and\n\nthe school 's enrollment was fallen to minimal levels.\n Older students from 4th grade and up are now bused to Hana High &\n\nElementary School 14 miles of winding road away. \n\n  There were three students at the school this year, said current\n\nteacher Laura Akiu Straight.\n The school accommodates kindergarten to 3rd-graders. The school is a\n\nsingle building with three rooms, said Kock-Wah.\n\n\n  Because the school was small, the academic atmosphere could be a\n\nchallenge for some students, according to some who attended the school.\n\n  \" There were so many grades in one classroom,\" said Vicky Martin,\n\nwho attended the school through the 8th grade, in 1956.\n\n\n  With several grades taught by one teacher in the same room,\n\nMartin said, it was hard for some students to learn.\n\n  But Aquino said having a mix of grade levels in a class was a \"\n\ngood incentive for everyone to learn.\"\n It would be embarrassing if you couldn't solve a problem on the\n\nchalkboard, while a younger student could.\n\n \n\n \n\n  Aquino also remembers some old school practices that probably\n\nweren't customary only at Keanae School. \n\n  \" We used to get licking from the teacher,\" he said.\n\n\n \n\n  The youngsters were also subject to inspection for personal\n\ncleanliness, including have their fingernails checked.\n Some children had a hard time keeping their nails clean because they\n\nworked in the taro fields.\n\n  There are also sunnier sides to the classes at Keanae, including\n\nthe socialization among youngsters at lunch time.\n\n  Aquino remembers bringing his kini 'ai, or two-piece lunch can.\n There was a bottom container for poi or rice, with a second container\n\nstacked on top to hold fried fish, fried frog, sardines, chicken or even\n\njerky meat made from pig. \n\n  \" That was the days we used to share our lunch,\" he said.\n\n\n  \" Because we are from that kind of community we learn how to\n\ngather our food from the land and the ocean.\" \n\n  Being in a rural community where children helped their families\n\nby working in taro patches, Martin said poi \" was the main lunch for the\n\nkids.\"\n\n\n  While memories may differ, Nakanelua, Aquino and Martin all agree\n\nthat majority of the students who went to the school turned out well.\n\n  \" All of the kids excelled in school,\" Aquino said.\n\n\n  Perhaps the success resulted from the small school setting, the\n\ndiscipline by guava stick, or maybe the strict teachers.\n\n  \" Some of the kids ( who got scolded) today turned out to be the\n\nbest students,\" Martin said.\n\n\n  Nakanelua is looking forward to seeing former teachers, residents\n\nand old friends at the reunion.\n Most Keanae students had to go elsewhere to live.\n \" They are holding good jobs,\" she said.\n\n\n  But for one day, she said, they can all be back in their little\n\ncountry school again.  \n\n\n\n Contractor constructs hands-on class, shelves, office and student\n\npride on donations he raises \n\n  HANA - - Building contractor Rick Rutiz was looking for a way to\n\ncombine his love of construction and his desire to teach children when he\n\ncreated a carpentry program at Hana High and Elementary School.\n\n  In the year since he started, Rutiz has fulfilled his dream of\n\nworking with children while building buildings and more importantly, building\n\npride within students.\n The results have been remarkable, according to program participants,\n\ntheir parents, counselors and the head administrator at Hana High School.\n\nWith Rutiz 's training, and the financial support of private donors and\n\ngrant-giving foundations, Hana students have built a counselor 's office, a\n\ncustodial complex, much-needed bookshelves and room dividers for classrooms,\n\na storage facility roof and even a home for a needy family in Hana.\n\n  Officially, Rutiz 's project is called the Hana School PTSA\n\nConstruction Trades Program.\n\n  Last fall, the program started with eight students and\n\n&dollar;45,000 in contributions Rutiz got from his clients.\n By May 2001, with Rutiz and supporters still soliciting donations,\n\nthe program was working with as many as 20 students and had a budget of\n\n&dollar;120,000. \n\n  The Hana PTSA Carpentry program ( the name students call it) was\n\nopen to students in grades 10 through 12.\n Participants enrolled either through one of Rutiz 's classes,\n\nbuilding/construction and industrial math, or they registered in Rutiz 's\n\nafter-school work program. \n\n  Some students involved were identified as \" at-risk\" - needing\n\nspecial attention because of poor classroom performance.\n Others needed a positive role model in their lives or found they did\n\nbetter in school outside the traditional classroom setting.\n\n\n  Without a real classroom, Rutiz met with students on a grassy\n\narea where their first project was to be built. \n\n \n\n  He showed his students how to apply math and science in real-life\n\nsituations.\n They talked about the goals of each project they were to take on and\n\ndiscussed everything needed to make it happen from tools to materials. Once\n\nprojects got under way, students used class periods and after-school time to\n\nearn real money -\n\n&dollar;10 an hour, of which\n\n&dollar;4 had to be used to purchase their own tools.\n\n  In less than four months, the students completed their first\n\nproject: a fully wired, 12- by 16-foot naturally ventilated office/classroom.\n Former Maui District Superintendent Paul Brown called it \" the most\n\nbeautiful classroom in the whole district.\" \n\n  The building features a custom Polynesian design with an\n\nopen-beam ceiling, koa wainscot and trim, an inlaid hardwood floor and\n\nwraparound recycled plastic deck.\n Outside walls include a mural designed by one of the students. Since\n\nthey completed that first project last December, the students have built a\n\n1,200-square-foot custodial complex that features a lunchroom and kitchen,\n\nstorage space, shop work area, and a sink with tile designs created by the\n\nstudents.\n\n  The project included 1,000 feet of concrete slab for the\n\nfloor.\n\n  Other on-campus construction projects included custom-built\n\nclassroom bookshelves, room dividers, a storage facility roof and a koa\n\ndisplay cabinet.\n\n  Rutiz 's program is also helping to build pride in the school.\n\n\n\n  Hana High School Principal Melanie Coates said she noticed a\n\ndecrease in incidents of student misbehavior on campus over one year.\n She attributed improvement in campus attitudes to the carpentry\n\nprogram. \n\n  \" It 's more than keeping them busy; the students are really\n\nengaged, and they're learni 'requality craftsmanship,\" she said.\n\n  With four different vice principals coming through the campus\n\nthis year, Coates said students had a \" window of opportunity\" to cause\n\nchaos.\n\n\n  And instead of being bogged down with discipline issues, Coates\n\nsaid administrators were able to focus on \" moving the school to higher\n\nground.\"\n Parents of students in the program have been especially pleased.\n Armine Medeiros, who works in the Hana School office, said she 's seen\n\na change in her 15-year-old son Ikaika. \n\n  \" Attitude wise, he 's really become humble,\" Medeiros said.\n \" He just grew up all of a sudden.\n\n\n  Medeiros gives all the credit to the carpentry program and to\n\nRutiz.\n \" This is one good program.\nI praise Rick; my boy 's just different now, and\n\nit 's great.\" \n\n  The Medeiros family, by coincidence, is in the process of\n\nconstructing its own home in Hana.\n Ikaika 's gotten very involved in the project.\n \" He helps his dad measure things, and he tells his dad he wants to\n\nhelp out.\n\n\n  Other parents praised Rutiz and the carpentry program through\n\nwritten endorsements submitted with appeals for donations and for grant\n\nrequests.\n \" It is a real joy as a parent to have my son come home from school\n\nexcited about learning, and wanting to share with me what he has learned in\n\nMr. Rutiz 's class,\" wrote parent Fawn Elder.\n She described Rutiz as a very talented craftsman \" with a special\n\ngift of being a great teacher who has the ability to motivate students who\n\nmight otherwise lose interest.\" \n\n  Elder said Rutiz teaches how to work and cooperate, as well as\n\ncarpentry skills.\n \" My wish is for Mr.Rutiz to able to continue what he has started at\n\nHana High school, and to be an example for other schools to start such\n\nprograms.\" \n\n  Elder told The Maui News she hopes her 11th-grader Benel will\n\nenroll in the program again this fall and plans to encourage her other son,\n\nOla, who will be a sophomore, to take Rutiz 's classes as well.\n\n  Hana parent Gena Sansone wrote that her son, Nick, had been\n\nlosing interest in school until he enrolled in Rutiz 's class. \n\n  \" Nick has learned so many important skills in this class, he\n\ncould go out today and be a contributing, valuable worker on any construction\n\ncrew,\" Sansone said.\n \" Because of this program, Nick now has talents that will translate\n\ninto a job, money, confidence and satisfaction.\" \n\n  Students also had positive comments about the program, noting\n\nthem in a brochure they designed to be used for fund-raising purposes.\n\n  \" This shows all the smart people sitting in class that we' 're\n\nsmart, too,\" wrote one student.\n\n\n  \" This class has helped me feel more confident; now I 'm learning\n\nsomething I know I can use in my life,\" another student wrote.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "01f5ebd9-7d68-4066-8191-0cc9f3a4be6a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.642702+00:00"}
{"text": "Lee runs the rough blade of his cutlass across the ruddy, smooth\n\nskin of the guinea mango; the chipped edge catches, piercing the epidermis,\n\nslicing out cleanly a thick, convex piece, the sticky, acrid juice flowing\n\nthrough his holding hand.\n He sets aside the seed-exposed main body, cups the independent piece\n\nin his hand and scores the almost translucent meat into a grid-like pattern\n\nwith the blunt blade-tip, criss-cross, criss-cross, I wonder if this seed\n\nwould take hold back home.\n He inverts the convexity into a concavity, the skin turned inside-out,\n\nthe flesh now exposed in bite-size rectangular chunks as if they grew that\n\nway--discrete, logical, vulnerable.\n He bites into the slippery morsels, heedless of the mildly caustic\n\nsyrup that trickles down his jaw, throat, bare chest.\n A gust blows across the veranda where he is sitting, streaking the\n\njuice across his abdomen. \n\n  The dim outline of the Fouta Djalon mountains on the horizon is\n\nrapidly being shrouded by the black-as-coal-smoke tropical cumulonimbus\n\nclouds, thunderheads roiling over the top, silent lightning flashes\n\nbacklighting random sections.\n Lee flings the still inside-out skin, now bereft of all flesh,\n\nfrisbee-style, out toward the rice field.\n It soars amazingly far, its particular geometry creating an airfoil,\n\ncutting across the strong wind, landing in a tangle of cassava plants.\n He is proud of this small discovery-he wonders if the ancient\n\nAfricans had little flying toys for their amusement.\n When Saidu comes for the evening water he will ask him if he knows\n\nthis trick. \n\n  The temperature and light is decreased drastically as if night\n\nhad fallen prematurely.\n Watching vainly for signs of goosebumps on his body, Lee quickly\n\nfinishes the remainder of the mango and fetches and places a bucket under the\n\nspout coming down from a corner of the roof. \n\n  The wind is falling off.\n The first of the raindrops are announcing their arrival on the zinc\n\npan roof; scattered rim shots soon give way to a continuum of a thousand\n\nsnare drums beating, beating. \n\n  As Lee continues to bask in the relative cool of the deflected\n\nmist he notices a bucket bobbing up from the bramble bushes that lead down to\n\nthe swamp.\n The expected head then appears beneath the bucket, then the upper\n\nbody of a woman.\n She is walking briskly and smoothly, spinal column perfectly\n\nvertical, arms at the sides, the bucket swaying slightly to and fro but\n\nstably as if it were just a decorative hat one put on nonchalantly.\n As the path from the swamp to the village passed next to his house,\n\nfollowing custom, Lee had to greet everyone who went by.\n Sometimes he would duck inside his house when he spotted a group of\n\nold women coming in from their farms--they spoke neither Krio nor English and\n\nLee was somewhat embarrassed and frustrated by his continuing inability to\n\nlearn Limba past the few basic phrases.\n They still derived a great deal of amusement from the mangled speech\n\nof this whiteman, this grown man who preferred to wear shorts and who did not\n\nhave a wife to cook meals for him. \n\n  The full figure of the woman is now visible, the lower half\n\nwrapped by a lappa, the torso plastered by a drenched T-shirt, the\n\ninscription on which is faded and indecipherable from this distance.\n It is clear now that she is a young woman, her well-defined breasts\n\nyet undrooped by the rigor of the child-rearing years.\n As she approaches his house her face remains obscured by the shadow\n\nof the bucket, an anonymous figure within the isolating walls of the deluge.\n\n\n\n  Lee prepares himself for a greeting, but the girl--she looks even\n\nyounger now--keeps moving up the path, head unturned by his existence, in\n\nunbroken rhythm as if entranced.\n He can make out the words on the T-shirt: \" Go climb the mountain.\u001d\n He recognizes it and realizes that she has it on backwards--the\n\nphrase should be on the back, not the front.\n\n\n  \" Eh, sistah.\n\n\n  She turns her head slowly toward him, the extra moment of the\n\nbucket resisting sudden rotation. \n\n \n\n  With a little start he realizes that he knows this girl, then\n\nafter a short delay his mind assembles her identity: Fatmata Jalloh, pupil in\n\nForm II.\n Not an outstanding student, somewhat lethargic, but socially\n\nwell-adjusted.\n She is particularly at a loss in his math class, but this doesn't\n\nseem to weigh upon her mind, and as she looks at him now he feels no heat of\n\nresentment, no opacity of shame in her eyes.\n She stares at him, not moving, not saying anything further.\n Lee 's unsettling impulse falters for a moment but makes him continue.\n\n\n\n \n\n  He switches to schoolhouse English and invests his words with the\n\nauthority of a teacher giving instruction.\n Wordlessly she comes to him on the veranda; she stays standing just\n\noutside the cover of the roof, the bucket on her head catching the thicker\n\ncurtain that falls from the edge. \n\n \n\n  Keeping her back straight she bends down on one knee then lowers\n\nthe bucket from her head.\n Water sloshes close to the rim; under its surface are the tight knots\n\nof washed and wrung garments.\n She stands on the concrete floor of the porch, stares at the\n\namorphous puddles of water growing around her bare feet.\n Lee is squatting on a foot-high, woven raffia stool, watching her\n\nstatic expression; he has seen this face many times before: the bank teller\n\nin town eating a bean sandwich and sipping her lukewarm bottle of Vimto with\n\nunbelievable languor, eyes in the general direction of the mildewy Krio sign\n\npainted on the wall, \" KEEP YOU KOPOH NAR BARCLAYS,\" while waiting\n\ncustomers--\"businessmen,\" market women, civil servants, farmers-stand\n\nsweating in the crowded lobby, warding off with a \" shilling\" the occasional\n\nbeggar that wanders in, but each one mirroring the same mask of negation, an\n\nanti-expression, that the teller wears signalling that time is suspended,\n\nthat no transactions are to take place at that moment; it is somehow like the\n\nTaoist 's \" uncarved block\" and the mu on which Zen practitioners meditate;\n\nand yet it is an effortless state and one from which the subject can abruptly\n\nexplode into violent laughter in response to a neighbor 's ribald joke.\n Whenever he confronts this wall ( as he perceives it), Lee feels\n\ndesperately alone. \n\n  As he gazes up at Fatu, he feels an extension of the same strange\n\nimpulse that made him call out to her; for no reason that he could fathom his\n\nheart is racing.\n In a mock stern voice he says, \" You know you should greet everyone\n\nyou meet, especially your own teacher.\" \n\n \n\n  God, what an asshole I'm being, 'mt it is only with the next\n\nwords that come out of his mouth that he understands why his pulse is\n\npounding in his stomach: \" Fatu, let we go siddohn small.\" \n\n  Fatmata Jalloh, daughter of a Fula entrepreneur who had wandered\n\nsouth of the colonial border as a young man to start the first bread bakery\n\nin Kukuna and a Limba mother who sold palm oil at the market, Fatu, at age\n\nfourteen, a responsible member of the Bundu society, a good Moslem who said\n\nher prayers then went to a Catholic secondary school where, uniformed in a\n\nbright azure schooldress, she learned the skills necessary to be a fine,\n\nmodern African woman: English, History, Home Ec., P.\n E., Agric., Bible, Maths, Geography, Forensics, and Religious\n\nKnowledge; she, who had inherited the caf\u00e9 au lait complexion and the petite,\n\nangular features of the Fula, raised her eyes at Lee, who was now standing,\n\nand giggled.\n It is, however, a momentary outburst.\n She quickly falls back to her previous state, eyes now staring past\n\nthe dried mango stains cutting diagonally across Lee 's smooth chest. \n\n  Lightning strikes strobelight the squall-induced murk, thunder\n\narriving almost simulaneously as soft kicks in the gut.\n The proposition somehow being articulated by someone he barely\n\nrecognized, the border crossing completed, Lee now feels compelled, without\n\nchoice, to explore the new moral territory that has been handed to him.\n His perceptions continue to operate displaced: he watches as his hand\n\nreaches out to take Fatu 's arm, but force is not necessary, they move\n\ntogether inside.\n He sees their journey in snapshots, each lightning stroke exposing\n\ntwo portraits: Fatu 's tin bracelet flashing bridal-white and its dark image\n\non the wall, glimpse of a shadowy shackle.\n He reaches under his bed for the Peace Corps medical kit through\n\nwhich he fumbles for a vestige of insensible sensibility; then under the\n\nmosquito net they go, hands quickly denuding body of wet things. \n\n  After a while it becomes clear that Fatu does not have any idea\n\nof what is going on but is very aware of the idea of it.\n Little gasps of pain and disjointed giggles; odd rushes of sadism and\n\nalienation.\n The bed convulses in rhythm, its creaking cutting more and more\n\nthrough the dying rain.\n Mosquitos can be heard riding their high-pitched notes, a cluster\n\nchord in variable tuning, swarming along the folds of the netting, bouncing\n\ntheir hungry bellies against the flexuous lattice.\n Sweat streams down from his armpits, over the hip bones onto her\n\npinned thighs; she is otherwise perfectly dry, the effects of the rain\n\nevaporated by her body heat; her skin silken, hairless, and absolutely\n\nblemishless save for the Bundu scars on her cheek and upper pudendum.\n Sunlight is already beginning to break through the departing clouds;\n\nthe open window, guarded by two vertical \" thief\" bars, admits a sudden light\n\nthat projects the warped square grid pattern of the mosquito netting on the\n\nsupine body of Fatmata, malleable coordinates that shift with each jolt, the\n\nsmooth landscape of her body defined geometrically and arbitrarily moment by\n\nmoment.\n As her eyes come into focus she turns her head away from the\n\nbrightness, her slender neck revealing perfect, taut sinews.\n The bed noise is alarmingly conspicuous without the rain, and soon\n\npeople will be walking about again.\n For Lee privacy is still a precious commodity, but it only seems to\n\ncome to him in small increments here in Kukuna. \n\n  Holiday...holiday...it would be so nice.\n Saidu loved to feel the squish of wet laterite between his toes as he\n\ndragged his feet along the puddles in the rutted path.\n He sang the refrain from the Madonna song over and over--he couldn't\n\nremember the verses--in a soft, accurate voice that remarkably resembled the\n\noriginal.\n She was not bad, but Michael Jackson was still his hero; every other\n\npage of his Geography notebook was filled with lyrics of My-Kell 's hits from\n\n\" Rock with You\" to \" Beat It\" in a stylized, florid handwriting using black\n\nand red ball-point pens.\n One entire page was devoted to a sketch of the map of Mississippi,\n\nU.S.A., with a miniature figure of the Moonwalker gliding across the city of\n\nJACKSON, prominently marked in red and black ink.\n Saidu had discovered the home of his idol, not in Geography class,\n\nbut on the map of America that Bruce Lee had on his bedroom wall.\n His discovery was confirmed by Mr. Lee himself: \" Oh yeah.\n The town was named after him.\u001d\n He was, however, deeply disappointed when he learned that Bruce had\n\nno cassettes of Michael Jackson; in fact, that had been the first question\n\nthat he had asked in class after Bruce had introduced himself as their new\n\nmaths teacher from the United States ( everyone was surprised; they had\n\nassumed he was Chinese).\n Of course, when they learned his name it became obvious who he really\n\nwas: Mr. Lee?\n Bruce Lee, of course!\n There was no denying it--he looked just like he did on screen except\n\na bit thinner.\n It didn't matter that Mr. Lee never admitted the fact--he was only\n\nconcealing his identity until those evil men with their chained and flying\n\nweapons descended upon Kukuna in search of the Dragon.\n Then we'll 'll who 's who.\n Saidu \" Golden Fox\" Momoh and the Kung Fu King will defend this\n\nvillage to the death! Ai-yaa! Golden Fox delivered a flying kick to the\n\nmalevolent trunk of a flamboyant tree. \n\n  Hitching up the tan polyester shorts that were always threatening\n\nto fall off the underside of his distended belly, Saidu suddenly paused to\n\nlisten closely: some strange noises were coming from the back of Bruce 's\n\nhouse that was now in full view.\n Quietly he stepped closer to the building.\n He couldn't hear anything now.\n Could it be...\n But not sensing any aura of danger he decided to call out, \" M-mistah\n\nLee!

{"text": "Media propaganda plays an integral role in motivating the general\n\npublic to participate in genocide.\n Leaders often use the media to indoctrinate the masses with their\n\nideology and advance their political agenda ( Straus 9/29/2009).\n More specifically, hate speech dehumanizes the intended victim and\n\nencourages discrimination ( Timmermann 354).\n Looking at propaganda is key to understanding whether a series of\n\natrocities were coincidental or part of a larger, deliberate plan.\n The insidious relationship between the mass media and genocide is\n\nparticularly evident in the genocide in Rwanda.\n In this paper, I will evaluate the role of Hassan Ngeze, a prominent\n\npropagandist in the Rwandan genocide.\n First, I will provide a basic historical overview of the conflict in\n\nRwanda.\n Second, I will examine Ngeze 's role as both editor-in-chief of the\n\nextremist newspaper, Kangura, and as a powerful authority figure in the Hutu\n\nregime.\n Third, I argue that Ngeze 's role was essential to creating a climate\n\nof fear in Rwanda.\n By disseminating propaganda, he advocated for racial hatred and\n\nincited the masses to commit horrific crimes against the Tutsis.\n Finally, I argue that Ngeze was rightfully tried under the Genocide\n\nConvention for incitement to genocide, genocide and crimes against humanity.\n It is important to note that Ngeze was not decisive to the outcome of\n\ngenocide.\n Other critical factors such as political instability, civil war, and\n\nlong-standing ethnic enmity between the Hutus and the Tutsis fostered a\n\nvolatile environment and fueled great brutality in Rwanda.\n However, by psychologically preparing the general population for\n\ngenocidal violence with propaganda, Ngeze was instrumental to inciting the\n\npublic to massacre the Tutsis with unprecedented speed, scope and\n\nsavagery.\n\n\n Genocide in Rwanda emerged from a complex historical background between\n\nthe Hutus and the Tutsis.\n Examining the context strengthens our understanding of the Kangura 's\n\nperspective and helps explain Ngeze 's role as a major Hutu leader during the\n\ngenocide.\n Mahmood Mamdani argues that the reorganization of the colonial state\n\nfrom 1926 to 1936 represents the key turning point in political violence and\n\nconflict in Rwanda.\n To help govern the state, Belgian colonial rule legally stratified\n\nthe Rwandan population into two distinct groups.\n The Mwame, or the Rwandan king, identified the Tutsi population as\n\nnon-indigenous and gave them special privileges.\n As a result, the Tutsis began to \" embrace the racialization of their\n\nown identity as non-indigenous,\" ( 105).\n Meanwhile, the Hutus were legally required to carry an identity card\n\nto mark their ethnic inferiority.\n Philip Gourevitch explains that \" Hutu and Tutsi identities took\n\ndefinition only in relationship to state power\"those ideas were largely\n\nframed as opposing negatives: a Hutu was what a Tutsi was not, and vise\n\nversa,\" ( 50).\n Frustrated by their legal status, a Hutu political counterelite\n\nemerged along with a Hutu nationalist movement.\n In 1959, the Hutus eventually gained political power through a social\n\nrevolution, founded the Republic of Rwanda in 1962 and forced the Tutsi\n\npolitical elite to flee to neighboring countries ( Zahar 45).\n While in exile, rebel Tutsi forces banded together to form the\n\nRwandan Patriotic Force ( RPF) and plotted to regain power ( Wallenstein\n\n353). \n\n Although genocide did not erupt until 1994, major episodes of violence\n\noccurred in Rwanda in 1959, 1963, 1966, 1973 and systematically from 1990 to\n\n1994 ( Des Forges 65).\n The RPF invasion from Uganda in October 1990 played a significant\n\nrole in goading anti-Tutsi propaganda.\n In addition, economic decline, popular unrest, Hutu discontent and\n\ninternational pressure on Rwanda to become a multiparty democracy, all\n\nthreatened the power of the extremist Rwandan government and exacerbated\n\nethnic tensions between the Hutus and the Tutsis, ( Kidder 270).\n Hutu political elites saw the extermination of Tutsis and their Hutu\n\nand Belgian \" accomplices\" as the ultimate solution to Rwanda 's problems, and\n\nused propagandist media to voice this hatred and mobilize violence (\n\nWallenstein 392).\n The RPF invasion helped the Hutu extremists gain legitimacy, popular\n\nsupport, and \" provided an ideal basis for a well-orchestrated campaign of\n\nvirulent anti-Tutsi propaganda\" ( Kidder 270).\n Immediately following the invasion, Ngeze founded the newspaper,\n\nKangura, and published an article warning that the RPF were preparing to wage\n\na war against the Hutus that \" would leave no survivors\" ( Des Forges 78).\n Kangura continued to advocate for ethnic hatred against the RPF and\n\nthe Tutsis through the onset of genocide when Rwandan president Juvenal\n\nHabyarimana and Burundian president Cyprien Ntaryamira were assassinated on\n\nApril 6, 1994 ( Des Forges 66).\n By July 1994, 500,000 Tutsis were massacred, which accounted for 75%\n\nof the total Tutsi population in Rwanda ( Straus 12/1/2009). \n\n\n  As editor-in-chief of the propaganda newspaper, Kangura, Ngeze\n\nhad exclusive control over the paper 's publications and wrote many editorials\n\n( \" Prosecutor v. Nahimana et. al.\" 2775).\n Thus, Ngeze was responsible for what was printed in Kangura and the\n\neffect of those words on Rwandan society.\n Kangura echoed the state 's racist creed and utilized lies and\n\nexaggerations to instill a sense of fear, hatred and paranoia in Rwandan\n\nsociety.\n For example, Kangura alleged that there were mass gravesites of\n\ninnocent Hutus to develop an anti-Tutsi sentiment ( Wallenstein 393).\n The paper consistently republished the Ten Bahutu Commandants, a\n\nviolent document that called for Hutu ethnic and racial dominance, hatred for\n\nthe Tutsi minority and that encouraged persecution of Tutsi women, ( \"\n\nProsecutor v. Ngeze\" 18).\n Moreover, Kangura painted the Hutus as innocent victims in a\n\nTutsi-led genocide.\n Alison Des Forges describes this phenomenon as \" accusation in a\n\nmirror,\" meaning that the \" party which is using terror will accuse the enemy\n\nof using terror\" ( 66).\n In this case, Kangura persuaded readers that it was the Hutu 's\n\nresponsibility to \" erase the enemy within\" and fight to preserve the pure\n\nRwandan nation ( Wallenstein 392).\n The media demonized the Tutsis by calling them names such as \"\n\ncockroaches, feudal lords, snakes, subversive and the enemy,\" and convinced\n\nthe Hutu majority that pre-emptive action against the Tutsi population was\n\nnecessary for their own self-defense ( Timmermann 354).\n In the article A Cockroach Cannot Give Birth to a Butterfly, for\n\nexample, Kangura wrote: \" A cockroach gives birth to another cockroach\"a\n\nTutsi is someone who has a sweet tongue but whose wickedness is\n\nindescribable.\n A Tutsi is someone whose desire for revenge is insatiable; someone\n\nwho is unpredictable, someone who laughs whereas he is suffering,\" (\n\nTimmermann 364).\n In addition to the Tutsi minority, the aggressive propaganda campaign\n\nwas also aimed at Hutus who opposed the Hutu Power ideology.\n These Hutus were depicted as \" accomplices\" of the Tutsis and were\n\nlargely targeted in the genocide ( Gourevitch 18).\n Finally, by publishing lists of specific Tutsi and moderate Hutu\n\ntargets in Kangura, Ngeze incited the militia and members of the community to\n\nviolently eliminate the Tutsi population ( Wallenstein 392). \n\n  Ngeze was an influential public figure in Rwanda during the\n\ngenocide.\n As a founding and active member of the Coalition for the Defense of\n\nthe Republic ( CDR) political party, Ngeze openly declared his extremist Hutu\n\nideology and exercised authority over the militia groups, Interahamwe ( MRND)\n\nand Impuzamugambi ( CDR) ( \" Prosecutor v. Ngeze\" 11).\n For example, in 1991, Ngeze distributed weapons to Hutu fighters and\n\nhelped train them to massacre Tutsis in Gisenyi prefecture ( \" Prosecutor v.\n\nNgeze\" 15).\n Additionally, in April 1994, Ngeze traveled with the Interahamwe to \"\n\nidentify the Tutsi and their 'accomplices' and kill them on the spot\"[He\n\nalso] took part in killings of Tutsi at Commune Rouge.\n He supervised the mass graves, commended the Interahamwe on their 'good\n\nwork' and encouraged them to continue the killing,\" ( \" Prosecutor v. Ngeze\"\n\n20).\n Ngeze and Kangura worked closely with the extremist radio station,\n\nRadio-Television Libre des Milles Collines ( RTLM), as \" partners in a Hutu\n\ncoalition,\" ( \" Prosecutor v. Nahimana et. al. 2773).\n Ngeze was a shareholder in RTLM and served as their Gisenyi\n\ncorrespondent.\n When interviewed on RTLM, Ngeze consistently called for the\n\nextermination of the Tutsis and moderate Hutus, and defended his extremist\n\nHutu ideology, ( \" Prosecutor v. Ngeze\" 14). \n\n\n  By perpetrating a climate of fear and hatred, Ngeze played a\n\nsignificant role in creating the conditions that led to genocide in Rwanda (\n\nTimmermann 364).\n Through Kangura, Ngeze conditioned the public to loathe the Tutsis on\n\nthe basis of their ethnicity, and convinced them that pre-emptive action was\n\nnecessary for their survival.\n Thus, by the time genocide broke out in April 1994, the masses were\n\nmotivated and prepared to systematically murder Tutsis at a blistering speed.\n Kangura was highly influential in Rwanda for many reasons.\n First, although only 66 percent of Rwandans are literate, those who\n\ndo not know how to read were either read to, or looked at cartoons \" which\n\nwere so graphic that they could not be misinterpreted,\" ( Des Forges 67).\n Second, Wallenstein argues, \" in times of instability, people tend to\n\nbe more reliant on mass media for information and guidance.\n They may know of crucial events only through mass media.\n In 1994 Rwanda, communications and travel became all but impossible,\"\n\n( 389).\n Although 95% of the population lives in rural areas of Rwanda and the\n\ngovernment was able to reach them using Kangura to preach their ideology.\n The paper was widely distributed by urban workers who carried copies\n\nwith them when they went home to the countryside for the weekends ( Des\n\nForges 67).\n In the 1990s, Kangura and the main radio station, RTLM, became the\n\nmain source of news for the nation and framed how the public should treat the\n\nTutsis. \n\n  Some argue that since the genocide in Rwanda was mostly committed\n\nby civilians to civilians, authority figures like Ngeze should not be\n\nresponsible for the colossal death toll.\n However, because conformity was deeply embedded in Rwandan culture,\n\nNgeze 's propaganda and his role as a community figurehead were especially\n\ninfluential.\n A Kigali lawyer, Francois Xavier Nkurunziza explained to Gourevitch\n\nthat, \" in Rwandan history, everyone obeys authority\"The people of\n\ninfluence\"may think that they didn't kill because they didn't take life with\n\ntheir own hands, but the people were looking to them for their orders.\n And in Rwanda, an order can be given very quietly,\" ( 23).\n The masses looked to leaders like Ngeze to direct them and tell them\n\nhow to behave.\n Ngeze used this to his advantage through the power of his words,\n\ncausing the public to believe that every Tutsi was a grave and imminent\n\nthreat.\n This relates to Stanley Milgram 's theory that obedience drives people\n\nto commit horrific crimes.\n When there is a legitimate authority figure, Milgram argues that\n\npeople will obey without question ( Straus 9/29/09).\n In Rwanda, Ngeze served as a legitimate authority figure and gave out\n\ndirectives knowing that the people would comply without question.\n Similarly, Christopher Browning argues that people who commit\n\natrocities were often just following orders \" or \" atrocity by policy.\"\n As seen in Rwanda, war helped Ngeze racially stereotype and\n\ndehumanize the Tutsis through propaganda.\n Browning also emphasizes that few perpetrators did anything to stop\n\nthe genocide.\n Ngeze was able to mobilize the community to massacre Tutsis through\n\nboth his actions and his inactions.\n According to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, \" Ngeze\n\nknew that the articles published in Kangura were inciting, aiding and\n\nabetting the local population and the militia groups to exterminate all the\n\nTutsis\"and failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent\n\nsuch acts.\"\n Additionally, Ngeze \" knew that the articles, speeches or interviews\n\npublished in Kangura resulted in widespread massacres of the Tutsi population\n\nand the murder of numerous moderate Hutus\" and was therefore a necessary\n\nvehicle in facilitating the violence ( 19).\n\n\n  Genocide first became an international crime under the Genocide\n\nConvention in 1948.\n The convention defines genocide as \" the deliberate and systematic\n\ndestruction, in whole or in part, of an ethnic, racial, religious, or\n\nnational group,\" ( Power 62).\n This law was first enforced at the International Criminal Tribunal\n\nfor Rwanda ( ICTR) after the 1994 genocide.\n ICTR examined the link between mass media and genocide \" setting a\n\nprecedent that hate speech is legally one of international law 's most heinous\n\ncrimes ( \" Prosecutor v. Nahimana et. al.\" 2769).\n The ICTR Appeals Chamber also ruled that \" hate speech directed\n\nagainst a group and inspired by discriminatory motives\"whether on the basis\n\nof ethnicity or any other basis\"violates the right to respect for the human\n\ndignity of the members of the group and thus constitutes discrimination in\n\nfact,\" ( Timmermann 364).\n In 2003, ICTR convicted Ngeze, along with two other media executives,\n\nFerdinand Nahimana and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, for genocide, incitement to\n\ngenocide and crimes against humanity ( \" Prosecutor v. Ngeze\" 25).\n In accordance with the Trial Chamber 's rulings, I agree that Ngeze\n\nwas guilty for his involvement in Kangura and his individual criminal\n\nactions. \n\n To determine the necessary elements of direct and public incitement to\n\ncommit genocide, an actor must publicly provoke a number of individuals to\n\ncommit a criminal action, ( Wallenstein 394).\n In Rwanda, Kangura satisfies this requirement because it is a form of\n\nmass communication meant to reach the community at large.\n Unlike other key actors, Ngeze was able to voice his extremist\n\nideology through a major outlet to quickly reach a wide audience.\n Propagandists often argue that they were simply exercising their\n\nright to freedom of expression, which makes it very difficult to prove their\n\nincitement to harm.\n \" Yet the ideal of freedom of expression does not justify undermining\n\npublic order\"In times of war and armed conflict, unlimited freedom of\n\nexpression may serve to subvert and sabotage the integrity of the nation and\n\ninspire crimes as horrifying as genocide,\" ( Wallenstein 388).\n Interestingly, the Tribunal notes that speech \" aligned with state\n\npower rather than in opposition to it deserves less protection to ensure that\n\nminorities without equal means of defense are not endangered,\" ( \" Prosecutor\n\nv. Nahimana et. al.\" 2772).

But they will grow up to be dangerous adults without\n\ntreatment.\" \n\n  While juveniles are supposed to get counseling and other forms of\n\npsychological and vocational assistance while they'r 'reocked up, crowding has\n\nmade it impossible for all or even most young delinquents to get the services\n\nthey need.\n\n  Although the number of reported crimes by juveniles dropped 11.6%\n\nin%the past five years, the population of youths between 10 and 18 has held\n\nsteady.\n Yet court records show that the number of juveniles charged with\n\ncrimes statewide has jumped 41%.\n%\n  \" Police officers, and detectives are getting a lot smarter and\n\nfiling their cases a lot better,\" said Tim Turley, head of the Denver County\n\nJuvenile Probation Department.\n\n\n  Other factors include better technology that allows police to\n\ntrack down juveniles who fail to appear in court or to pay fines. And tougher\n\nsentences handed down by judges are a direct result of the war on drugs and\n\ngangs.\n\n  \" They'r 'reeacting to the constituency who are tired of criminals\n\nrunning around on the street,\" said Turley.\n 'The public believes that all criminals need to be locked up - that\n\nprobation is a slap in the wrist.\" \n\n  Still, there is little evidence to support the idea that\n\noffenders being sentenced to secure, long-term facilities all are sent there\n\nfor the most serious crimes.\n Of those sentenced to detention during the last five years, 61%\n\nco%mitted property crimes and 29% commi%ted crimes against others.\n The remaining cases were for public order offenses, including\n\nescape, drugs and weapons.\n\n  Those sentences were handed out since the legislature approved\n\nfunding for the design and construction of new detention centers for youth\n\nafter the Division of Youth Services submitted its long-range plan to the\n\nColorado General Assembly in 1985.\n\n  Today, officials say they will need an additional\n\n&dollar;63 million for more construction if the trend of detention for juveniles\n\ncontinues.\n\n  Officials project a need for more than 1,200 beds in four years.\n\n\n  With such numbers in mind, the state legislature in on the verge\n\nof approving a measure aimed at keeping troubled youngsters outside of\n\ninstitutions whenever possible.\n The senate bill moved out of the house appropriations committee late\n\nlast week.\n\n  \" Right now it 's been helter-skelter how some of these kids have\n\ngotten into detention,\" Democratic Sen. Jim Rizzuto of Swink told his\n\ncolleagues.\n \" We now have youth incarcerated who don't belong in that\n\nsituation.\" \n\n  The bill requires state and local officials involved with the\n\njuvenile justice system to develop criteria by July 1, 1992, on which\n\nyoungsters should be placed in detention, and calls on counties to have\n\nalternatives to confinement in place by 1993.\n\n  Sen.

{"text": "American medicine is by many measures the best in the world- so\n\nwhy is it generally agreed that the system is 'in crisis'?\n\n\n\n  HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON and her Task Force on National Health Care\n\nReform are attempting to design a health-care system for the twenty-first\n\ncentury.\n Unfortunately, key elements of the emerging plan look more like\n\ntwentieth-century collectivist experiments in Eastern Europe and Asia than a\n\nfuturistic model for America.\n\n  Bill Clinton 's campaign promises on this subject seemed so\n\nappealing: Health coverage would be extended to 35 million uninsured people\n\nin the United States.\n All Americans would get full coverage at a reasonable cost, regardless\n\nof their medical history.\n All plans would offer preventive care as well as protection from\n\ncatastrophic expenses.\n Government would help to streamline administration, reduce paperwork,\n\nand lower costs.\n The money saved on Medicare and Medicaid would be used to help\n\nbalance the federal budget.\n\n  For the last three months, more than five hundred academics and\n\ngovernment bureaucrats have been mired in the complexities of figuring out\n\nhow to make these utopian campaign promises a reality.\n The outline of the plan, scheduled to be unveiled this month, is\n\nfairly clear.\n The centerpiece is \" managed competition,\" a depersonalizing scheme\n\nembraced by big corporations, insurance companies, and bureaucratic\n\norganizations.\n Under the plan, large networks of doctors and hospitals, organized\n\nprimarily by insurance companies, would offer budget-priced health-care\n\nservices to collections of consumers for a fixed monthly fee.\n Regulators would prescribe the services to which patients would be\n\nentitled through their \" core benefits package,\" and \" gatekeepers\" in these\n\nbig networks would control access.\n\n  In other words, beyond the mask of \" pro-business, pro-\n\nentrepreneur language\" ordered up by White House strategist James Carville\n\nlurks a system characterized by price-control agreements, rationing, and\n\ncentralized government decisions over how much health care consumers will\n\nget, how they will get it, and how technology will be used and\n\nconstrained.\n\n \n\n  Core benefits package.\n A new National Health Board will define the basic doctor and\n\nhospital services that would be available to all of us, from preventive care\n\nto catastrophic coverage.\n This is tricky, however: If the package is all- inclusive, it will be\n\nimpossible to fund, but if it rations care, the political fallout will be\n\ntremendous.\n\n  Purchasing cooperatives.\n New organizations called \" health insurance purchasing\n\ncooperatives\" or \" health alliances\" would be created.\n These quasi-public groups would represent employers and perhaps\n\nindividuals in negotiations to buy hospital, doctor, and laboratory services\n\nfrom newly formed \" super HMOs.\"\n The big health-maintenance organizations would compete with one\n\nanother to offer the lowest price for providing the core benefits package.\n The networks would be prohibited from denying anyone coverage and\n\nwould be required to charge everyone basically the same monthly fee to\n\nreceive health-care services.\n\n  A global budget.\n One of the trickiest issues is whether to require the new\n\nNational Health Board to set a budget for how much the nation would spend on\n\nhealth care.\n If a global budget were set, some inflation adjusted version of\n\ncurrent annual expenditures--currently about\n\n&dollar;900 billion--would become the new ceiling, and states would probably be\n\nrequired to enforce the limits.\n The task force may require private insurers to abide by new, lower\n\nreimbursement fees for doctor and hospital services for Medicare patients.\n A debate on whether to impose mandatory price controls has been\n\nraging at the White House.\n\n  Employer mandates.\n All employers would be required to offer health insurance.\n Ninety-seven per cent of companies responding to a recent National\n\nAssociation of Manufacturers survey already provide health insurance.\n The National Federation of Independent Business says that two-thirds\n\nof its members provide health insurance, and of the third that don't, 92 per\n\ncent said they would if they could afford it.\n Those that don't are primarily small, start-up, and marginal firms;\n\nthe Clinton plan may call for a phase-in with tax breaks to help make the\n\ncoverage more affordable.\n However, small-business organizations have warned the President that\n\nrequiring employers to provide coverage will mean a loss of up to five\n\nhundred thousand jobs.\n\n  Even before it is unveiled, the Clinton plan is being modified to\n\nrespond to political practicalities.\n Patients are being told that they will be able to buy extra services\n\nif they are willing to pay more, and they are being assured they will be able\n\nto choose their own physician.\n Big companies can opt out of managed-competition networks if they\n\nwant.\n And the task force is considering asking industry for \" price-control\n\nagreements\" as a substitute for mandatory price controls.\n\n  Managed competition is tailor-made for a President who professes\n\nsupport for the private sector but whose political nature compels him to\n\ndevise complex new government programs.\n While passage of the proposal is far from assured, the Clinton team\n\nalready has scored one significant victory.\n It has engaged the nation in debating how much and what kind of\n\ncontrol the government will have over the nation 's health-care system,\n\npreempting discussion, at least for now, of alternative free- market\n\nsolutions.\n\n\n  NOW the hard work and cold reality of paying for the promises has\n\nbegun.\n Task Force czar Ira Magaziner estimates that the plan would cost\n\n&dollar;100 to\n\n&dollar;150 billion in new spending.\n The White House has tried to squelch the number and put the estimate\n\nat\n\n&dollar;30 to\n\n&dollar;90 billion--a more politically salable figure.\n\n  The list of problems with managed competition is endless.\n Internal Task Force documents concede, \" The plan would be\n\ncumbersome.\n Consumers would have to deal with new and unfamiliar agencies [ \"\n\nhealth alliances\"] and choose from among plans they feel ill-equipped to\n\nevaluate.\n Unanticipated barriers to service would be erected when people are\n\nsick.\"\n Because managed competition theoretically offers patients unlimited\n\naccess to doctors and hospitals, the length of lines at the clinics, not\n\npricing, would regulate demand.\n Bureaucrats would continually ratchet down the services in the \" core\n\nbenefits package\" as costs escalated.\n Most importantly, technological innovation would decline as cost\n\nconcerns take priority over quality of care.\n \" High-tech medicine\" frequently is cited as the culprit in rising\n\nhealth-care costs.\n While medical technology may be expensive, these advances almost\n\nalways lead to more cost-effective total care and a better quality of life.\n In no other industry is less technology considered progress.\n Unfortunately, restricting access to new technologies is now seen as\n\npart of the solution.\n The ethical question over access to expensive treatments by those\n\nunable to pay is one of the most difficult to address.\n But restricting access to innovative treatments and new technologies\n\nbecause they are too costly to be included in the \" core benefits package\"\n\nwill quickly diminish the quality of patient care for everyone.\n\n\n  THE CURRENT SYSTEM does need fixing.\n It distorts pricing and demand, is inequitable, and is alternately\n\nwasteful and miserly.\n Too many people are locked into jobs they don't like because they are\n\nafraid of losing their health insurance, and millions more don't have\n\ncoverage at all, forcing them to go untreated or obtain care in crowded\n\nhospital emergency rooms.\n\n  Unfortunately for Mr. Clinton, 75 per cent of Americans are\n\nreasonably satisfied with their own health care, according to pollster\n\nWilliam D. Mclnturff of Public Opinion Strategies in Alexandria, Va.\n \" They clearly are not ready for massive changes in the way they get\n\ncare for themselves and their families, even though they may say that changes\n\nare needed to fix the system for everyone else,\" Mclnturff said.\n\n  One reason they are happy is that the great majority of the more\n\nthan two hundred million Americans with coverage is insulated from the true\n\ncosts of medical services.\n Imagine that every time you went to the supermarket you paid only 20\n\nper cent of your grocery bill, because your \" food insurer\" picked up the\n\nrest of your tab.\n You and other insured shoppers would have little incentive to be cost\n\nconscious, and you would likely buy caviar and prime steaks instead of potato\n\nchips and hamburgers.\n\n  Luxury items eventually would push moderately priced goods off\n\nthe shelves, and people without food insurance would find the price of food\n\nprohibitive.\n The cost of food insurance would rise, and more and more people would\n\nbe left standing outside the supermarket.\n\n  This is precisely the system that has fueled the inflation of\n\nhealth-care costs in the United States.\n Inflation is the inevitable result of shielding consumers from the\n\ncosts of their purchases.\n And as prices increase, fewer people can afford coverage,\n\naccelerating the spiral.\n\n  Who are the uninsured today?\n Of the estimated 35 million people who lack access to health-care\n\nreimbursement at any given time, many are young people in entry-level jobs,\n\nthe self- employed, the working poor who earn too much to qualify for\n\nMedicaid, or workers who are between jobs.\n Half of the uninsured lack coverage for four months or less.\n Only a small minority, about 15 per cent of the 35 million, are\n\nuninsured for more than two years.\n Even with this group, hospitals rarely deny emergency treatment to\n\ninjured or seriously ill patients.\n\n  Managed competition will not help the chronically uninsured.\n But rather than target solutions to this entrenched group, policy\n\nmakers are ready to impose extraordinarily cumbersome top-down \" solutions\"\n\nthat will dramatically alter a segment of the economy that employs ten\n\nmillion people and constitutes one-seventh of the U.S.\n\n\n\n  THE QUESTION that is central to the problem but which is not\n\nbeing asked is this: How can we change the behavior of the buyers and sellers\n\nof services so that the health-care sector functions more like a competitive\n\nmarket?\n\n\n  Incentives.\n Americans are sophisticated consumers who decide what they\n\nneed in many fields, and they can use the same skills in making purchases\n\nfrom their doctors, given the proper incentives.\n But U.S.\n medical-payment systems seldom require them to employ these skills,\n\npartly out of a paternalistic belief that medical care is too complex for\n\nmost patients to understand.\n More than 90 per cent of all medical decisions are made in a non-\n\ncrisis situation; if consumers were motivated to be more financially\n\nresponsible about health-care purchases, information markets would spring up\n\nto help them make choices.\n\n  Tax deductibility.\n Nowadays few question the connection between health benefits\n\nand employment.\n But Milton Friedman says this makes no more sense than the early\n\nindustrial ploy of paying employees with vouchers that could be spent only at\n\nthe company store.\n The reason Americans expect their employers to buy their health\n\ncoverage for them is misguided tax policy that makes premiums deductible for\n\ncompanies but not for most individuals.\n The vast majority of employees are precluded from making individual\n\nchoices in an open and competitive market to select the kind of health\n\ncoverage that best suits their needs.\n Managed competition promises choice, but it will offer only those\n\nchoices mandated by government in a highly regulated environment--hardly an\n\natmosphere for viable competition.\n\n  Furthermore, employer-based insurance encourages over-use of\n\nhealth services.\n Employees have given up wages to get health coverage, and they want\n\nto get value from the wage substitute.\n As a result, health insurance increasingly has evolved from\n\ncatastrophic to first-dollar coverage.\n After employees pay their deductible for the year, they expect to\n\nget all the health care they want for 20 cents on the dollar.\n This overuse in turn increases the costs of coverage.\n It is highly indicative that more than 97 per cent of individuals to\n\nwhom tax-free insurance is available are insured, while only 33 per cent who\n\nmust buy health insurance without a tax deduction are insured.\n Further, the code discriminates against the lowest-paid workers in\n\nfavor of the highest-paid.\n For a typical family earning\n\n&dollar;20,000, the tax break for health insurance is worth\n\n&dollar;366.  For some one earning more than\n\n&dollar;100,000, it 's worth\n\n&dollar;1,463.\n\n  Allowing individuals to purchase their own health insurance with\n\ntax-deductible dollars would do more than anything else to bring market\n\nincentives to the health care system.\n\n  In this transfer of deductibility, employees would expect\n\nassurances that the money that their employers had been spending on health\n\ncoverage would now come to them directly so they could buy their own\n\ncoverage.\n Most employers would be happy to arrange this so as to get the\n\nmonkey of rising health-care costs off their backs.\n\n  Restoring true insurance.\n The great fear of the middle class is not that they won't be\n\nable to pay the bill for their flu shot: it is of bankrupting medical bills\n\nin the event of catastrophic illness.\n But in virtually all developed countries, the concept of using\n\nhealth insurance as a protection against financial risk has been lost.\n Instead, health insurance has become a plan for pre-payment of\n\nroutine medical expenses.\n\n  Those who want the predictability of a pre-paid plan for routine\n\ncare should be able to buy such coverage to simplify their access to\n\nphysicians.\n But those who would rather save money and pay out of pocket for\n\nroutine bills should be able to buy policies that provide them insurance only\n\nfor major bills.\n This would discourage people from over-using health services.\n It would reward cost-consciousness.\n And it would encourage people to be more responsible for their own\n\nhealth.\n Just as they realize that reckless driving makes their car insurance\n\nmore expensive, disregard for their health could increase the costs of their\n\nmedical insurance.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4739376b-f3e0-4a87-b2cd-0d81b7a0c950", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.649675+00:00"}
{"text": "States should start with the assumption that they may use their funds in\n\ninnovative ways to achieve the critical goals laid out in the TANF statute.\n The following steps outline a simple step-by-step process to follow in\n\ndetermining how to best use the available funds.\n\n  The first step in the process of deciding how best to use TANF and\n\nMOE funds is to identify needs within the State and prioritize them.\n This step includes identifying needs, weighing alternative options and\n\nstrategies that address these needs ( e.g., for consistency with TANF\n\npurposes and requirements), selecting the most appropriate services and\n\nbenefits, and designing programs or activities that reflect those\n\ndecisions.\n\n  If the proposed program or activity achieves a TANF purpose, the\n\nsecond step involves determining the nature of the benefit.\n A State may choose to spend funds on activities that are considered \"\n\nassistance\" under the Federal regulations. \n\n  NOTE: See pp. 25-26 and \u00e1260.31 of TANF rule for additional\n\ninformation on \" assistance.\" These activities are subject to a variety of\n\nspending limitations and requirements - - including work, time limits, child\n\nsupport assignment, and data reporting.\n A State may also choose to fund activities that are not considered \"\n\nassistance.\" These latter activities would not have the same requirements\n\nassociated with them.\n\n\n  The next step is to define individual eligibility criteria (\n\nwhich would generally be in the form of income and/or resource standards) for\n\nreceipt of benefits.\n The first and second purposes of TANF concern only \" needy families\"\n\nor \" needy parents,\" respectively, as defined by State criteria.\n Thus, a State must establish financial eligibility criteria for\n\nbenefits under either of these purposes.\n For the third and fourth purposes, a State may use Federal funds to\n\nprovide services to both needy and non-needy families that are consistent\n\nwith those purposes. \n\n\n  The State must then decide how to fund the desired program\n\nbenefits and services.\n This decision will determine what specific requirements apply and\n\nwhether a particular use of funds is appropriate. \n\n  All State expenditures claimed under the MOE requirements must be\n\nmade with respect to \" eligible families.\" These families need not actually\n\nbe TANF recipients in order to receive services or benefits funded with MOE\n\ndollars; they need only be financially eligible for the service or benefit (\n\nand have a minor child living with an adult relative in the home).\n The definition of \" eligible families\" is very similar to that of \"\n\nneedy families\"; eligible families are families that meet the income and\n\nresource standards in the State plan.\n In addition, they must be either: ( 1) eligible for TANF; or ( 2)\n\neligible for TANF, but for the five-year time limit on federally funded\n\nassistance or the restrictions on benefits to immigrants found in title IV of\n\nthe 1996 welfare law ( Public Law 104-193). \n\n  In addition, the State may count as MOE only the qualified\n\nexpenditures that exceed its program spending in 1995.\n\n\n  A State may expend Federal funds, but not State MOE funds, for\n\nactivities that were previously authorized under its IV-A or IV-F plans, but\n\nwhich are not otherwise allowable under TANF ( including juvenile justice\n\nand/or State foster care maintenance payments).\n\n\n  The final step in determining how best to use the available TANF\n\nfunds is to determine what requirements, limitations, and restrictions apply\n\nto the selected activities or services.\n The last two sections of this guide outline the statutory\n\nrequirements, restrictions and cost principles that apply.\n For example, they address the requirements associated with \"\n\nassistance\"for certain clients, the administrative cost caps, the medical\n\nservices prohibition, and general appropriations principles.\n Specific questions on these limitations can be directed to the ACF\n\nRegional Offices for clarification. \n\n\n\n  The TANF program gives States broad flexibility to make program\n\nand funding decisions that they believe will best support the goals of the\n\nprogram and their individual circumstances.\n They may use Federal funds for a wide array of services and benefits\n\nthat were previously allowable only through specific, categorical programs.\n States should view their Federal TANF grant as a source of funds that\n\nthey may use creatively to support work and the efforts of low-income working\n\nfamilies, promote marriage, and reduce and prevent out-of-wedlock\n\nchildbearing.\n In support of these goals, they may use their funds to fill gaps in\n\nthe service delivery system, integrate program services, and supplement or\n\nenhance the services available through other programs. \n\n\n\n  Under the prior public assistance program, all families in\n\nsimilar circumstances of need were entitled to a standard package of basic\n\nbenefits and services.\n Under TANF, States have the ability to offer services to some, but\n\nnot all, families and to tailor services and benefits so that they better\n\naddress the needs of individual clients.\n They also have the ability to make adjustments in the services they\n\noffer, depending upon funding availability and other factors.\n However, under their TANF State plans, States must set forth the\n\nobjective criteria for the determination of eligibility and the delivery of\n\nbenefits and for the fair and equitable treatment of clients.\n\n\n  States may set different financial eligibility criteria for\n\ndifferent types of benefits in order to increase the number of families they\n\nhelp to become self-sufficient.\n For example, States may set higher income standards to establish\n\neligibility for transitional benefits ( i.e., for those no longer receiving\n\ncash assistance) in order to provide these families child care,\n\ntransportation, and other job retention and advancement services.\n For instance, States may limit eligibility for TANF cash assistance\n\nto families with income below poverty, while making transitional child care\n\nand transportation services available to families with incomes up to 185% of\n\nthe poverty line.\n By adopting these different standards, States may provide work\n\nsupports to a broader range of low-income, working families.\n\n  Under this principle, a State can set different financial\n\neligibility criteria based on any number of categorical distinctions.\n For example, as we indicated above, States may apply different\n\nstandards for \" assistance\" than for other types of benefits or services.\n Also, where appropriate, a State may deem specific groups financially\n\neligible for particular services if there is a categorical, factual basis (\n\nfor example, homelessness) for determining financial need. \n\n\n  A State that had a welfare reform waiver(s) approved before\n\nenactment of PRWORA may continue to operate its program under some or all of\n\nthose waivers rather than the TANF rules.\n For States that elect this option, the provisions or requirements of\n\nTANF that are inconsistent with the waiver are not effective until the\n\napplicable waivers expire.\n\n\n  Under TANF, the Federal government may not regulate State conduct\n\nor enforce any provision except to the extent expressly provided by law.\n Consistent with the principle of State flexibility in program design,\n\nthe final TANF rules regulate only where Congress specifically directed the\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services to do so or where the Department is\n\ncharged with enforcing penalties.\n\n\n  State, local, and Tribal TANF agencies, or private organizations\n\nproviding services under contract with the TANF agency, may use Federal TANF\n\nfunds in one of three fundamental ways:\n\n\n  Under this provision, allowable expenditures for particular\n\nactivities, benefits, or services consist of those that are \" in any manner\n\nreasonably calculated to accomplish\" any one of the four purposes of the TANF\n\nprogram.\n Activities, benefits, or services that are reasonably calculated to\n\naccomplish a TANF purpose are those that directly lead to ( or can be\n\nexpected to lead to) achievement of a TANF purpose.\n This language includes all activities that are obviously related to a\n\npurpose.\n It also includes activities whose relationship to a purpose may not\n\nbe obvious, but for which there is evidence that it achieves a purpose.\n For example, there is a clear statistical relationship between\n\nstaying in school and lower teen pregnancy rates.\n Thus, we would conclude that special initiatives to keep teens in\n\nschool are reasonably related to the third purpose of TANF - to reduce\n\nout-of-wedlock pregnancies. \n\n  States may use Federal TANF and State MOE funds in accordance\n\nwith this principle for a variety of eligible activities.\n\n  Under this purpose, a State could help any needy parent,\n\nincluding a noncustodial parent or a working parent, by providing employment,\n\njob preparation, or training services.\n Examples of potential services include job or career advancement\n\nactivities, marriage counseling, refundable earned income tax credits, child\n\ncare services, and employment services designed to increase the noncustodial\n\nparent 's ability to pay child support.\n Activities that promote any one of the three objectives - job\n\npreparation, work, and marriage - - would be consistent with this purpose.\n\n\n\n  Like a needy family, a needy parent must meet the income and/or\n\nresource standards established by the State in its TANF plan.\n\n  The following example illustrates how some of the funding\n\nprinciples would apply in meeting this TANF purpose. \n\n  A State agency determines that there are insufficient child care\n\nservices available for the pre-school age children of working needy parents.\n A Head Start facility can meet this need.\n The TANF agency could contract with the Head Start grantee to provide\n\nchild care services for a number of TANF families who are not enrolled in\n\nHead Start or to provide expanded hours of child care services for TANF\n\nfamilies whose children are enrolled in the Head Start program. \n\n  The State agency may pay for these services with Federal TANF or\n\nState MOE funds.\n ( However, the Head Start grantee must account for the TANF and MOE\n\nfunding separately from its Head Start funding and must also be able to\n\nidentify the needy or eligible families served with the TANF or MOE\n\nfunds.)\n\n  Neither this purpose nor the following purpose ( related to\n\nfamily formation) is limited to needy families or individuals.\n Thus, a State may use Federal TANF funds, but not MOE funds, to serve\n\nnon-needy families or individuals for either of these two purposes.\n However, the State must establish objective criteria for the delivery\n\nof services to the non-needy. \n\n  Potential activities that would be reasonably calculated to\n\naccomplish this purpose include abstinence programs, visiting nurse services,\n\nand programs and services for youth such as counseling, teen pregnancy\n\nprevention campaigns, and after-school programs that provide supervision when\n\nschool is not is session.\n A State may also fund a media campaign for the general population on\n\nabstinence or preventing out-of-wedlock childbearing.\n\n  A significant share of TANF families consists of unmarried\n\nmothers with low skills who live with their children apart from low-skilled,\n\nunderemployed fathers.\n Many of these fathers are involved in the lives of their children and\n\nprovide some financial support, but would like to do much more.\n Historically, however, the fathers have found limited employment\n\nopportunities, and welfare rules have worked to discourage family formation\n\nand fuller involvement of these fathers in the lives of their children. \n\n  This fourth TANF purpose offers the opportunity to address these\n\nissues.\n Some activities that are reasonably calculated to accomplish this\n\npurpose might include parenting skills training, premarital and marriage\n\ncounseling, and mediation services; activities to promote parental access and\n\nvisitation; job placement and training services for noncustodial parents;\n\ninitiatives to promote responsible fatherhood and increase the capacity of\n\nfathers to provide emotional and financial support for their children; and\n\ncrisis or intervention services.\n\n\n  This statutory provision allows States to use Federal TANF funds\n\nfor specific activities that had been previously authorized based on an\n\napproved title IV-A or IV-F plan and using the same eligibility criteria\n\ncontained in the approved plan.\n While the purposes of the TANF program are very broad, some\n\nactivities that are not now permissible had been included in a State 's\n\napproved AFDC plan, JOBS plan, or Supportive Services plan as of September\n\n30, 1995 ( or, at State option, as of August 21, 1996).\n Examples of such activities are juvenile justice and certain State\n\nchild welfare and foster care activities that were included in many States'\n\napproved plans.\n A State may continue to provide these services or benefits that were\n\npreviously authorized, notwithstanding the prohibitions in PRWORA ( under\n\nsection 408 of the Social Security Act).\n For example, if a State 's approved AFDC plan as of September 30,\n\n1995, allowed it to assist children in the juvenile justice system, then it\n\nmay continue to use TANF funds for such activities even though the child is\n\nnot living with a parent or other adult caretaker relative.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5bb9aacb-7cb8-478f-bf74-d566e82bb5f9", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.651517+00:00"}
{"text": "She had lived there, in her fourth floor apartment on the near\n\nnorth side of the city, for nearly three years.\n It was an uneventful three years from the outside; Gabriel liked it\n\nthat way.\n She just wanted to live her life: go to work, see her new friends,\n\nhave a place to herself. \n\n  But looking a bit closer, it was easy to see what a wonderful life\n\nshe had.\n Her apartment was impeccable, with Greek statues and glass vases\n\nlining the hallways, modern oil paintings lining her walls.\n She was working at her career for a little under two years and she had\n\nreceived two hefty promotions.\n She served on the board of directors for the headquarters of a\n\nnational domestic abuse clinic and single-handedly managed to increase annual\n\ndonations in her city by 45%, as well as drastically increase the volunteer\n\nbase for their hotline numbers.\n She managed a boyfriend, a man who was willing to put up with her\n\nrunning around, working overtime for her job, visiting clinics.\n A man who loved and respected her for her drive.\n\n\n  Yes, life seemed good for Gabriel, she would dine in fine\n\nrestaurants, visit the operas and musicals travelling through the city.\n\n\n  Eric would wonder what her past was like when he'd hit a 'derve\n\nwith her and she would charge off to work, not talking to him for days.\n She had only lived in the city for three years, and he knew nothing\n\nabout her life before then.\n In the back of his mind, he always thought she was hiding something\n\nfrom him, keeping a little secret, and sometimes everything Gabriel said made\n\nhim believe this secret was real.\n She told him her parents lived on the other side of the country, and\n\neven though they dated for almost two years there never was talk about\n\nvisiting them.\n She never received calls from her old friends.\n\n\n  This would get to Eric sometimes; it would fester inside of him\n\nwhen he sat down and thought about it, all alone, in his apartment, wondering\n\nwhen she would be finished with work.\n And then he'd see h 'd again, and all of his problems would disappear,\n\nand he'd feel 'dke he was in love. \n\n  One morning he was sitting at her breakfast table, reading her\n\npaper, waiting so they could drive to work.\n \" Hey, they finally got that mob-king guy with some charges they\n\nthink will stick.\" \n\n  Gabriel minded her business, put her make-up on in the bathroom\n\nmirror, hair-sprayed her short, curly brown hair. \n\n  \" Hey, Gabriel, get a load of this quote,\" Eric shouted down the\n\nhallway to her from his seat.\n He could just barely see her shadow through the open door to the\n\nbathroom.\n \" 'My client is totally innocent of any charges against him.\n It is the defense 's opinion that Mr. Luccio was framed, given to the\n\npolice by the organized crime rings in this city as a decoy,' said Jack\n\nHuntington, defense lawyer for the case.\n 'Furthermore, the evidence is circumstantial, and weak.' What a joke.\n I hope this guy doesn't get away with all he 's done.\n\n\n  Gabriel stopped hearing his voice when she heard that name.\n She had heard Luccio over and over again in the news, but Jack.\n She didn't expect this.\n Not now.\n\n\n  But not long enough.\n Her hands gripped the edge of the ceramic sink, gripping tighter and\n\ntighter until she began to scratch the wood paneling under the sink.\n Her head hung down, the ends of her hair falling around her face.\n He lived outside of the city, nearly two hours.\n Now he was here, maybe ten minutes away from her home, less than a\n\nmile away from where she worked, where she was about to go to. \n\n  She couldn't let go of the edge of the sink.\n Eric stopped reading aloud and was already to the sports section, and\n\nin the back of her mind Gabriel was wondering how she could hurt herself so\n\nshe wouldn't have to go to work.\n She would be late already, she had been standing there for over ten\n\nminutes. \n\n  Hurt herself?\n What was she thinking?\n And she began to regain her senses.\n She finally picked her head up and looked in the mirror.\n She wasn't the woman from then, she had to say to herself as she\n\nsneered at her reflection.\n But all she could see was long, blonde straight hair, a golden glow\n\nfrom the sun, from the days where she didn't work as often as she did, when\n\nshe had a different life. \n\n  She had to pull on her hair to remind herself that it was short.\n She pulled it until she almost cried.\n Then she stopped, straightened her jacket, took a deep breath and\n\nwalked out the bathroom door. \n\n  Eric started to worry.\n As they car-pooled together to work, Gabriel sat in the passenger\n\nseat, right hand clutching the door handle, left hand grabbing her briefcase,\n\nholding it with a fierce, ferocious grip.\n But it was a grip that said she was scared, scared of losing that\n\nbriefcase, or her favorite teddy bear from the other kids at school, or her\n\nlife from a robber in an alley.\n If nothing else, Eric knew she felt fear.\n\n\n  He tried to ask her.\n She said she was tired, but tense, an important meeting and a\n\npounding headache.\n He knew it was more.\n She almost shook as she sat in that car, and she began to rock back\n\nand forth, forward and back, ever so slightly, the way a mother rocks her\n\nchild to calm her down.\n It made Eric tense, too.\n\n\n  Work was a blur, a blur of nothingness.\n There was no meeting, the workload was light for a Friday.\n But at least the headache was there, that wasn't a lie.\n She hated lying, especially to Eric.\n But she had no choice, especially now, with Jack lurking somewhere in\n\nthe streets out there, winning his cases, wondering if his wife is dead or\n\nnot. \n\n  She never wanted him to know the answer.\n Eric called her a little after four.\n \" Just wanted to check if we were still going to dinner tonight.\n I made the reservations at the new Southwestern place, you said you\n\nwanted to go there.\n\n\n  Gabriel mustered up the strength to respond, and only came up\n\nwith, \" Sure.\" \n\n  \" Do you still have the headache, honey?\n Do you want to just rent a movie or two and curl up on the couch\n\ntonight?\n\n\n  She knew at this point he was doing all he could to make her feel\n\nbetter.\n She didn't want to put him through this.\n He shouldn't have to deal with her like this.\n\n\n  \" No, Eric, dinner would be fine.\n We can go straight from work to save the drive.\n Thanks, too.\n\n\n  Eric smiled at the end of the line.\n\n\n  They got off the phone, she finished her work, turned off her\n\ncomputer, started walking toward the elevator when it finally occurred to\n\nher: Jack might be there.\n She can't go.\n Even if he 's not there, she could see him on the street, driving\n\nthere.\n\n\n  She pressed the button for the elevator.\n And he could just as easily see me walking out of work, getting in\n\nEric 's car, she thought.\n I have to stop thinking like this.\n This is ludicrous.\n And he won't be there, he won't see me, because, well, the chances\n\nare so thin, and Hell, it 's a big city.\n\n\n  But she couldn't.\n\n\n  At the restaurant, they sat on the upper level, near one of the\n\nlarge Roman columns decorated with ivy.\n She kept looking around one of the columns, because a man three\n\ntables away looked like Jack.\n\n\n  The meal was delicious, the presentation was impeccable.\n She was finally starting to relax.\n The check arrived at the table right as the place began to get\n\ncrowded, so Gabriel went to the washroom to freshen up before they left.\n She walked through the restaurant, feeling comfortable and confident\n\nagain.\n She even attracted a smile from a man at another table.\n She walked with confidence and poise.\n\n\n  She walked into the bathroom, straight to the mirror, checking\n\nher hair, her lip stick.\n She looked strong, not how she looked when she was married.\n\n\n \n\n  There he was, Jack, standing right there, waiting for a table.\n He had three other men with him, all in dark suits.\n She didn't know if they were mob members or firm associates.\n Or private eyes he hired to find her.\n Dear God, she thought, what could she do now?\n She can't get to the table, he'l 'llee her for sure.\n\n\n  And then she thinks: \" Wait.\n All I'v 'veeen is the back of him.\n It might not even be him.\" She took a breath.\n \" It 's probably not even him,\" she thought, \" and I' 'vesat here\n\nworrying about it.\" \n\n  Still, she couldn't reassure herself.\n\n\n  A minute passed, or was it a century?, and finally he started to\n\nturn, just as they were about to be led to their table.\n She saw his profile, just a glimpse of his face.\n It was him, it was Jack, it was the monster she knew from all those\n\nyears, the man who made her lose any ounce of innocence or femininity she\n\never had.\n She saw how his chin sloped into his neck, the curve of his nose,\n\nhow he combed his hair back, and she knew it was him. \n\n  By the washrooms, she stared at him while he took one step away\n\nfrom her, closer to the dining room.\n Then she felt a strong, pulling hand grip her shoulder.\n Her hair slapped her in the face as she turned around.\n\n\n  \" The check is paid for.\n Let 's go,\" Eric said as he took her jacket from her arm and held it\n\nup for her.\n She slid her arms through the sleeves, Eric pulling the coat over\n\nher shoulders.\n She stared blankly.\n\n\n  She asked him if they could stop at a club on the way home and\n\nhave a drink or two.\n They found a little bar, and she instantly ordered drinks.\n They sat for over an hour in the dark club listening to the jazz\n\nband.\n It looked to Eric like she was trying to lose herself in the\n\ndarkness, in the anonymity of the crowded lounge.\n It worried him more.\n\n\n  And she drove on the expressway back from dinner, Eric in the\n\nseat next to her.\n He had noticed she had been tense today, more than she had ever\n\nbeen; whenever he asked her why she brushed her symptoms off as nothing. \n\n  The radio blared in the car, the car soaring down the four lanes\n\nof open, slick, raw power, and she heard the dee jay recap the evening news.\n A man died in a car accident, he said, and it was the lawyer\n\ndefending the famed mob leader.\n\n\n \n\n  Time stopped for a moment when the name was spread, Jack, Jack\n\nHuntington, like a disease, over the air waves.\n Jack, Jack the name crept into her car, she couldn't escape it, like\n\ncontaminated water it infiltrated all of her body and she instantly felt\n\ndrugged.\n Time stood still in a horrific silence for Gabriel.\n Hearing that midnight talk show host talk about the tragedy of his\n\ndeath, she began to reduce speed, without intention.\n She didn't notice until brights were flashing in her rear view\n\nmirror, cars were speeding around her, horns were honking.\n She was going 30 miles per hour.\n She quickly regained herself, turned off the radio, and threw her\n\nfoot on the accelerator.\n Eric sat silent.\n They had a long drive home ahead of them from the club, and he knew\n\nif he only sat silent that she would eventually talk. \n\n  While still in the car, ten minutes later, she began to tell him\n\nabout Andrea. \n\n  \" Three years ago, when I moved to the city, my name wasn't\n\nGabriel.\n\n\n  \" Seven years ago, I was a different person.\n I was a lot more shy, insecure, an eighteen year old in college, not\n\nknowing what I wanted to study.\n I didn't know what my future was, and I didn't want to have to go\n\nthrough my life alone.\n My freshman year I met a man in the law school program at school.\n He asked me out as soon as he

{"text": "A radical feminist argues that multiculturalism is a healthy\n\nrenewal of our best democratic traditions\n\n  Critics of political correctness have tried to promulgate the\n\npreposterous myth that college campuses are dominated by radical\n\nphilosophers, literary critics, and historians who are attempting to coerce\n\ntheir colleagues and students into accepting a monolithic system of left-wing\n\nbeliefs.\n This charge has nonplussed radical professors, who are all too\n\npainfully aware of their minority status, the chaotic and often discordant\n\nheterogeneity of their views, and especially their relative immpuissance in\n\nboth campus and national politics.\n\n  What pains me, as one of those radical professors, is not that the\n\npolitical-correctness charges are unfair, misplaced, and totally outrageous (\n\nalthough they certainly are) but, rather, that the whole PC controversy has\n\nmade it more difficult for those of us who deeply care about the real\n\nsuffering of real people, caused by the inequities and dysfunctionalities in\n\nour society, to have our voices heard.\n The PC rabble-rousers have fortified existing social practices and\n\ninstitutions against the sort of fundamental criticism that is essential for\n\nany society to be responsive to human needs in rapidly changing\n\ncircumstances.\n\n  How can this be happening?\n There is an aphorism by Friedrich Nietzsche called \" Ennoblement\n\nthrough Degeneration\" which I think sheds light on how a swirl of thoroughly\n\nfatuous PC allegations can be treated so seriously by otherwise intelligent\n\npeople.\n Nietzsche says that, for a society to flourish, its members must share\n\na common faith consisting of deeply held, long-standing, and unquestioned\n\nassumptions.\n Those persons who are most susceptible to this suppression of\n\ndifference through the inculcation of the common faith are called  bound\n\nspirits  by Nietzsche, and it is crucial to the health of a society that\n\nthey predominate.\n\n  The danger to communities composed of bound spirits is what\n\nNietzsche calls \" an increasing, inherited stupidity\" ( this and other quotes\n\nare from the Marion Faber translation of  Human, All Too Human  ,\n\nUniversity of Nebraska Press).\n The problem is that bound spirits have little or no capacity for\n\ncreative and critical imagination--their minds are literally bound by the\n\ncommon faith.\n Thus, for a society to progress and adapt to changing circumstances,\n\nfor it to stay one step ahead of stupidity, there is a need for persons who\n\nare less bound, less confined by the moral certainties of their\n\nsociety--namely, the  free spirits  .\n \" They are persons,\" says Nietzsche, \" who try new things, and many\n\ndifferent things.\"\n\n  Because they are less bound by the moral principles that partly\n\nconstitute the common faith, free spirits are perceived by bound spirits as\n\nmorally weak.\n The former are thus largely incapacitated as agents of change within\n\nthe community; therefore, innumerable free spirits die, Nietzsche says,\n\nwithout ever having a noticeable effect on society.\n\n\n  They loosen things up, and, from time to time, deliver a wound to\n\nthe stable element of a community.\n\n\ninoculated  , so to speak, with something new; however, the community 's\n\noverall strength has to be great enough to take this new thing into its\n\nbloodstream and assimilate it.\n Wherever progress is to ensue, deviating natures are of greatest\n\nimportance....\n the type, the weaker ones\n\nhelp to  advance  it.\n\n  ...\n It is precisely the weaker nature, as the more delicate and free,\n\nthat makes progress possible at all...\n [ However,] only when permanence is securely established and\n\nguaranteed is there any possibility of constant development and ennobling\n\ninoculation, which, to be sure, will usually be opposed by the dangerous\n\ncompanion of all permanence: authority.\n\n  When social authority succeeds for a time in squelching the\n\nvoices of social critics, the society will experience a consequent increase\n\nin \" inherited stupidity.\"\n Some contemporary examples of this kind of cultural torpor are\n\nprovided by Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan.\n His proposals for dealing with the extraordinarily complex challenges\n\nof an increasingly multicultural society include accepting only white\n\nEuropeans as immigrants, building a fence along the entire length of the\n\nMexican border, and having National Guard troops do their summer duty near\n\nthe fence.\n His suggestion for managing the problem of homelessness is to throw\n\npeople who have no homes in jail.\n\n  Of course, it is not the mere fact of Buchanan as an individual\n\nsaying these stupid things that exemplifies Nietzsche 's theory.\n Buchanan 's policy proposals grow out of some quite traditional and\n\nwidespread assumptions, and he is being taken seriously by established\n\ninstitutions, including Republican Party officials and the news media.\n Pat Buchanan thus personifies the cultural torpidity that pervades\n\ncertain less adaptive elements of U.S.\n\n\n  A more complex and interesting example of the sort of stupidity\n\nNietzsche describes is the recent rise to fame and political clout of\n\nChristina Hoff Sommers, a philosophy pro- fessor who has been certified by\n\nthe  Boston Globe  as a \" critic of ` political correctness.'\"\n\nAlthough Sommers, a professor at Clark University and a member of the\n\nright-wing National Association of Scholars, may not be known generally, she\n\nis quite notorious among philosophers working in the area of feminism as the\n\nauthor of several articles, all quite similar in style and content, attacking\n\nfeminism generally and certain feminist philosophers in particular.\n\n  Although three of these articles appeared in scholarly journals (\n\n Public Affairs Quarterly, Social Philosophy and Policy, and the Journal\n\nof Social Philosophy  ) , they diverge markedly--and instructively, I\n\nshall claim--from the range of tone and techniques usually found in\n\nphilosophy journals.\n on invective, sarcasm, quoting\n\nout of context, misrepresentation, distortion, hasty and inapt\n\ngeneralization, baseless speculation, unsupported claims, and\n\noversimplification.\n When she does ( on occasion) address the substantive points or\n\narguments made by the philosophers she wishes to criticize, she responds to\n\nthem with indirection and vagueness.\n I should like to give examples of Summers' use of some of the\n\nforegoing techniques.\n The cumulative effect will, I think, make Sommers look pretty bad,\n\nbut I want to emphasize that I am not claiming that Sommers herself is\n\nstupid.\n However, her reactive way of dealing with serious philosophical\n\nissues raised by feminist critics exemplifies the  cultural \n\nstupidity that Nietzsche says results when a society is deprived of the sort\n\nof radical criticism that can keep it alert.\n\n  Summers' use of invective is brazen and irresponsible.\n For example, she refers to \" the resolute and methodical\n\ninfiltration\" of universities by feminists, disregarding the extraordinary\n\nobstacles feminists have had to overcome ( quite openly)--including\n\nwell-established patterns of discrimination against women in general--in\n\norder to achieve acceptance in universities.\n The quote in question also deceptively suggests a level of success\n\nthat feminism has certainly not enjoyed in Sommers' own discipline, where\n\nsome graduate programs have no women at all on their faculties and only a few\n\nhave professors specializing in feminism.\n\n  Sommers' reference to academic feminism as \" a powerful but\n\nsincerely anti-intellectual movement\" is an all-too-typical example of her\n\nuse of invective in place of argument.\n The charge of anti-intellectualism is bizarre on its face, since\n\nacademic feminism is a movement of intellectuals engaged in intellectual\n\nactivity.\n Sommers' only support for the charge consists of the following\n\npassage:\n\n  Susan Sontag talks of a \" persistent indiscretion of feminist\n\nrhetoric: anti-intellectualism\" and, she says, she has felt the need to \"\n\ndissociate myself from that wing of feminism that promotes the rancid and\n\ndangerous antithesis between mind ...\n and emotion.\"\n Too many leaders of Academic Feminism promote that antithesis in the\n\nmanner in which they oppose male to female \" ways of knowing.\"\n\n  Both Sontag 's quote and Sommers' use of it are perplexing.\n The distinction between intellect and emotion is not a pro- duct of\n\nfeminist theory; it is, rather, a centerpiece of the Western patriarchal\n\ntradition and has in fact been  criticized  , not promoted, by many\n\nfeminist theorists.\n This passage serves as striking evidence of Sommers' ignorance of a\n\nsubject about which she has written so much.\n\n  Sommers makes liberal use of sarcasm.\n Interestingly ( in light of the quality of her own work), one of her\n\nfavorite tactics is to dismiss a feminist claim as \" embarrassing.\"\n She calls the belief that sex and gender have a pervasive, systemic\n\nsocial influence a \" prism\"--thereby suggesting that it distorts reality--and\n\nthen speaks of those who take the sex-gender system seriously as having been \"\n\nproperly fitted with the sex/gender prism.\"\n In response to feminist claims of the pervasiveness of the sex-gender\n\nsystem, she asks: \" What sort of sightings are being reported?\"--thus\n\nattempting to trivialize the extraordinary mass of statistical,\n\nanthropological, and historical data that has now been accumulated on the\n\noppression of women by comparing it to UFO sightings.\n\n  Sommers even uses sarcasm to excuse her own ignorance of her\n\nchosen subject: \" There is a kind of feminism-of-the- week that one cannot\n\nhope to keep abreast of, short of giving up all other concerns.\"\n About Simone de Beauvoir and \" other feminist theoreticians,\" Sommers\n\nsays that \" it is hard to see how one could count anything they say as a\n\ndiscovery whose tidings will one day be believed by a world of objective\n\nscholars.\"\n This passage is interesting not just as an example of Sommers'\n\nsubstitution of sarcasm for argument but also because it demonstrates either\n\nher ignorance of or cavalier attitude toward a major theme in twentieth-\n\ncentury philosophy--the critique of \" objectivity.\"\n\n  Feminists' views are often misrepresented by Sommers.\n For example, she claims that \" the feminists advocate abolishing the\n\nfamily.\"\n She does not cite a single feminist who in fact argues for such an\n\nabolition, yet her usage of \" the feminists\" suggests that they all do.\n The attribution of various opinions and ideas to \" the feminist,\" \"\n\nthe feminists,\" \" the academic feminists,\" and so forth, is among Sommers'\n\nfavorite ploys, creating the impression of a false uniformity in a field of\n\nstudy noted for its diversity of viewpoints.\n\n  Quoting out of context is another technique of misrepresentation\n\nfavored by Sommers.\n She attributes to Sandra Harding, a distinguished philosopher of\n\nscience, \" the speculation and hope that physics may someday be ` relegated\n\nto the backwaters of knowledge-seeking.'\" Checking the footnote reference, I\n\nfound the following passage in Harding 's book,  The Science Question in\n\nFeminism  : \n\n  Physicists, chemists, philosophers of science, and most of the\n\nrest of us believe that physics is the paradigm of science, and that science\n\nwithout physics as its paradigm is unimaginable.\n Minds reel at the suggestion that perhaps, in the science of the\n\nfuture, physics will be relegated to the backwaters of knowledge-seeking and\n\nthought to be concerned only with esoteric problems that have little impact\n\non how we live.\n Perhaps even today its problematics, methods, and favored languages\n\nalready provide distinctly atypical examples of scientific inquiry that\n\nshould not be models for other areas.\n We can entertain this thought even while we appreciate the historical\n\nreasons why physics has been the paradigm of scientific inquiry.\n\n  This richly provocative passage, which fits quite respectably\n\ninto the tradition of critical philosophy of science, is reduced to\n\ncaricature by Sommers.\n She has a proclivity for quoting out of context, with little or no\n\ncomment, leaving the orphaned passages to fend for them- selves without their\n\nsupporting explanations and arguments.\n Sommers tries to excuse this practice--as well as her tendency to\n\navoid actually analyzing the views of which she is critical--by saying that \"\n\nsome of the positions are, to my mind, sufficiently off balance to fall by\n\ntheir own weight, so criticism of them is served by mere citation.\"\n This quote illustrates the irresponsibility and lack of seriousness\n\nwith which Sommers approaches her subject.\n It also represents an attitude that could hardly be more at odds with\n\nthe Western philosophical tradition that she regularly takes pains to\n\nvenerate.\n\n  When she does actually attempt to support her views, she\n\ntypically does so with phrases like \" such evidence as we have argues for,\" \"\n\nwe know that,\" and \" we are now aware that.\"\n In fact, she relies greatly on what she--or someone like her- \"\n\nintuitively understands.\" And she relies crucially on her own visions of \"\n\nwhat women want\" and what \" most American women are not in sympathy with\";\n\namong her main themes are the claim that feminists advocate changes that, in\n\nher view, wouldn't automatically be popular with women as she knows them, and\n\nthe claim that feminists make criticisms of society that have not already\n\nbeen made by women in general.\n\n  Sommers makes a similar claim in a sentence striking for its\n\nindirection through the use of the passive voice:\n\n  The tension between the goals of academic feminism and the common\n\naspirations of women was reflected in the discussions of the Tenth Barnard\n\nConference on the Feminist and the Scholar, where it was noted that, within\n\nthe movement, heterosexuality has been viewed as \" politically\n\nincorrect.\"\n\n  Aside from the fact that we could question the extent of Sommers'\n\nknowledge of either \" the goals of academic feminism\" or \" the common\n\naspirations of women,\" we must ask: \" it was noted\" by  whom  ?\n By one person or by many?\n In a plenary session or a small workshop?\n And what was the response of the other conference participants?\n And, likewise, what does \" within the movement ...has been viewed as\"\n\nmean?\n Has it been one person, a few people, or many people who have held\n\nsuch a view?", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "eb86f675-c4c5-4e26-919d-cedf058fddc7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.654027+00:00"}
{"text": "The year 1994-95 began for UMass Boston with resounding good news.\n The Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the New England\n\nAssociation of Schools and Colleges gave us four commendations in continuing\n\nour accreditation for the next ten years.\n We were commended for successfully pursuing the goals of our last\n\nstrategic plan despite a major economic downturn and in particular, for\n\ninstituting new graduate programs that further our urban mission.\n But the Commission also commended us for our commitment to\n\nundergraduate students, for maintaining a \" culture of teaching\" with\n\nprograms aimed at improving and developing pedagogy, and for infusing the\n\nstudent support functions of our Office of Student Affairs throughout campus\n\nlife.\n Finally, we were praised for the widespread participation of faculty,\n\nstaff, and students in the accreditation process itself, which in many ways\n\nfocused campus energy during the previous two-and-a-half years.\n\n  Members of our community take these commendations not only as a\n\nvote of confidence, but also as something else: a sign for us that one phase,\n\nthe middle phase, of UMass Boston 's history has ended, and that a new one has\n\nbegun: our maturity as an educational institution.\n During 1995-96, we did come out of our accreditation process with a\n\nrenewed zest in our ongoing activities of teaching and learning, research and\n\nscholarship.\n That zest is reflected again and again in these pages.\n But much of our campus energy during the past year was also focused\n\non charting a course for a new phase of our institutional history.\n\n  Much of this report is devoted to our plans for this new phase.\n It begins with the completion of our Strategic Plan for the next five\n\nyears, continues through the drafting of principles for transforming\n\nundergraduate education across the campus, and moves into planning for the\n\nconstruction of a long-awaited Campus Center--and the first capital campaign\n\nin our thirty-year history.\n\n  But this movement into our future is not just planning; it 's also\n\ndoing.\n Important as it is, the Campus Center is part of a larger effort of\n\nrenovation and construction.\n During the past year we were able to move our Department of Public\n\nSafety from the basement of the Healey Library to bright, highly visible new\n\nquarters tucked under the Quinn Administration Building on our plaza.\n And in the library space freed by the move, we have created a\n\nLearning Center--a physical setting for faculty and staff to acquire new\n\nskills for the twenty-first century.\n\n  We moved as well into a permanent process of academic program\n\nreview.\n We conducted our first review, enabling us to shift resources into\n\nneeds defined by our new strategic plan.\n We then assessed and revised these standards in preparation for a\n\nreview three years from now.\n At the same time, members of our faculty and administrative staff set\n\nguidelines for assessment in every phase of our campus life.\n as my special\n\nassistant for urban affairs, we have begun a re-examination of our \" urban\n\nmission\" itself, something which, despite clear successes, we do not take for\n\ngranted.\n\n  This, then, is a report about a year of accomplishment by\n\nstudents, faculty, and staff, but also about passing a milestone and reaching\n\nfar beyond it.\n I send it to you with pride in our effort, and with my best wishes.\n\n\n  For the past three years, committees of faculty and staff\n\nrepresenting the breadth of the university have sought to define excellences\n\nin teaching and curriculum that would enable UMass Boston to help its\n\nstudents meet the evolving challenges of the next century.\n In June, the Faculty Council accepted a set of recommendations of its\n\nGeneral Education Steering Committee to shape a new university-wide general\n\neducation curriculum.\n\n  The Committee recommended assessment of the outcomes of learning,\n\nthe adoption of new ways to gain and improve intellectual skills, adaptation\n\nto rapidly-changing demands of the workplace, and campus-wide faculty\n\ncollaboration in the development and testing of new pedagogies.\n It portrayed an educational life in which students were members of \"\n\nlearning communities,\" working closely with other students and faculty in\n\nintimate groupings of courses and other experiences.\n It described a learning experience which helped students become\n\nself-conscious learners adept in thinking, communication, and research,\n\ntaking multiple perspectives on issues--and understanding the impact of their\n\nstudies on the life of metropolitan Boston.\n\n  The Faculty Council then charged thirty members of our faculty\n\nand staff to work throughout the summer to bring the implementation of a new\n\ngeneral education curriculum for UMass Boston nearer to completion.\n They formed working groups focused on four aspects of general\n\neducation: a developmental model with organizing principles for a\n\nfour-year-program; the students' first-year experience; science education;\n\nand world languages and culture.\n By summer 's end, the groups were to report on pros and cons,\n\nalternative approaches, and issues particular to their areas of concern. \n\n\n  UMass Boston 's transformation of undergraduate education will\n\ncall forth widespread, daily collaboration among faculty across boundaries of\n\ncolleges and disciplines.\n That type of examination of boundaries and making of new connections\n\nbegan as well in other areas of UMass Boston 's academic program during\n\n1995-96.\n\n  UMass Boston 's ninth doctoral program, a Ph.D. program in nursing\n\nto be conducted in collaboration with UMass Lowell, was given final approval\n\nby the Higher Education Coordinating Council in November.\n Its students, the first of whom began their studies in fall 1996, can\n\ndraw on special strengths in nursing and health care policy on the Boston\n\ncampus, and nursing and health promotion in Lowell.\n The new doctoral program crosses boundaries on the Boston campus in\n\nanother respect: it will draw on courses and faculty in our doctoral programs\n\nin gerontology and public policy and our master 's programs in business\n\nadministration, counselor training, and human services.\n\n  UMass Boston 's varied approaches to international studies,\n\nincluding its programs in European studies, East Asian studies and\n\ninternational relations, were brought together as a Division of Global\n\nStudies.\n Similar structures that bring together shared interests across the\n\ntraditional boundaries of colleges and departments were begun for two aspects\n\nof education: foreign language instruction and the training of undergraduate\n\nstudents as teachers.\n\n\n  UMass Boston 's faculty and staff know full well that the\n\nfinancial costs of providing undergraduate students with excellent\n\ncampus-wide general education will be great: they established nine doctoral\n\nprograms during the most difficult moments for the Massachusetts economy in\n\nUMass Boston 's history.\n In the process of establishing those programs, they conducted two\n\nmajor reviews of their allocation of resources.\n In 1995-96, they made the Academic Program Review a permanent process\n\non a three-year cycle, guaranteeing that scarce resources can be shifted to\n\nmeet emerging needs.\n\n  A committee of senior faculty, deans, and staff examined each of\n\nfifty-five academic programs with a set of criteria that touched upon every\n\naspect of their activity, from teaching to public service.\n After careful review and consultation, it recommended that seventeen\n\nprograms either be eliminated or have their resources reduced; thirteen have\n\ntheir resources increased; and twenty-five remain constant.\n The committee concluded its work by establishing criteria for a\n\nreview to follow in three years.\n\n  The Academic Program Review was the most visible aspect of an\n\neffort to engage UMass Boston in careful assessment in every aspect of its\n\nfunctioning.\n UMass Boston was one of twenty-six American colleges or universities\n\nthat had been chosen to participate in the American Council on Education-W.W.\n\nKellogg Foundation Program in Institutional Transformation.\n In 1995-96, a steering committee of faculty and staff drafted a\n\nmaster plan to bring campus-wide assessment into reality.\n\n  At the same time, the Boston campus participated in the UMass\n\nsystem 's administrative redesign initiative--bringing state-of-the-art\n\nmanagement expertise to developing cost-saving measures in such areas as\n\npurchasing, and new efficiencies in areas such as the administration of\n\nstudent financial aid.\n\n\n\n  UMass Boston 's 1995-96 operating budget was\n\n&dollar;125,319,357.  This represents a modest 3.3% increase ove% 1994-95,\n\nprimarily in grants and contracts, fundraising activity, and state financial\n\naid.\n State support for the campus rose by\n\n&dollar;1.4 million, or 2.4 %, to\n%\n&dollar;61.8 million; but state support now represents only 49.2 % of total\n\noperating funds.\n\n  We continued our policy of minimizing student charge increases by\n\nonly modestly raising fees, which now represent 15% of our revenue.\n As we examine our current fiscal situation and project future growth,\n\nwe believe it is realistic to forecast that state funds will remain less than\n\n50% of the total.\n Our future financial stability and capacity to develop new programs\n\nwill come largely from our success in increasing non-state funding and\n\nenrollment.\n\n  During 1995-96 we also continued to assess expenditures carefully\n\nthrough the academic program review and administrative redesign processes.\n Several recommendations for reallocation of existing resources to\n\ncritical activities were formulated and carried out.\n We admitted the first students to our M.A. Program in Dispute\n\nResolution, our Ph.D. Program in Computer Science, and the Urban School\n\nLeadership Track of our Ed.D. Program; and, through a major networking\n\nproject, we provided ethernet access to every desktop and student lab. \n\n  We were delighted that funding for much-needed deferred\n\nmaintenance, as well as for Campus Center construction, rose dramatically in\n\n1995-96.\n We now expect to complete many repair projects over the next three\n\nyears and to move forward with the Campus Center, which will open its doors\n\nas early as the year 2000.\n\n  UMass Boston 's fiscal situation has stabilized.\n With careful planning, wise investment of existing resources, and\n\nactive solicitation of new funds, we are confident that we can reach the\n\ngoals we have set for ourselves.\n\n\n  The year 1995-96, the thirty-first in our history, was special in\n\nmany ways--for the successes of our students and the teachers that guided\n\nthem, for breakthroughs in research, and for the affirmation of our role in\n\nmetropolitan Boston.\n It was a year in which we committed ourselves to self-assessment,\n\nestablishing new connections--and looked into our future.\n\n  In one sense we are still a very young institution.\n We still count among us members of our first faculty and staff.\n They remember well what it took to constitute an entirely new faculty\n\nand deliberate on an institution 's identity.\n\n  Many more of us understand a middle phase of an institution 's\n\nexistence: to chart a new direction as we did during the 1980 's in graduate\n\neducation, and turn an institution 's resources toward that direction, even in\n\nthe most difficult budgetary climate in our history.\n\n  In 1995-96, I feel, UMass Boston began a new phase.\n We made the review of our programs a permanent process, and put it on\n\na regular cycle.\n We began the re-examination of functions we knew were\n\nexcellent--undergraduate teaching, the pursuit of our urban mi,ssion--to\n\nassure their excellence in a rapidly changing future.\n We affirmed the loyalty of our alumni and friends, and appealed to\n\nthat loyalty to help build our future by planning our first capital campaign.\n\n\n\n  These are functions of a mature institution.\n In 1995-96, UMass Boston took up the challenge of its maturity.\n In 1995-96, I feel, UMass Boston began a new phase.\n We made the review of our programs a permanent process, and put it on\n\na regular cycle.\n We began the re-examination of functions we knew were\n\nexcellent--undergraduate teaching, the pursuit of our urban mission--to\n\nassure their excellence in a rapidly changing future.\n We affirmed the loyalty of our alumni and friends, and appealed to\n\nthat loyalty to help build our future by planning our first capital campaign.\n\n\n\n  These are functions of a mature institution.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fb225fb9-1918-4e5f-bd50-dae0ebca5d8e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.655524+00:00"}

their furniture is made of\n\nwood, not an artful imitation. \n\n  Chemists, my gang, do have a special way of playing with the\n\nnatural, however.\n First, they see it as a challenge to make any molecule nature can.\n And they do it, those master builders of tiny structures.\n They may manage their synthesis less efficiently than nature does,\n\nbut then nature has had a few million more years to optimize almost any\n\nprocess. \n\n  Second, chemists want to make molecules that aren't present in\n\nnature.\n Why not a molecule that looks like an icosahedron ( B12H122-)?\n Or one like a soccer ball ( C60)?\n This is real fun.\n ( And the fun wasn't spoiled by finding C60 in nature after it was\n\nmade in the lab!) \n\n  Third, they want to make molecules that resemble natural ones but\n\nare better in some respect.\n There now exist polymers stronger than steel, and fats to fry your\n\nonion rings in that are calorie-free because they are not digested. \n\n  Fourth, chemists want to make molecules that are sort of like\n\nnatural ones but a little different.\n Why?\n To fool bacteria and viruses, of course.\n To trick them into committing suicide or not reproducing.\n\n\n  Fifth, chemists make synthetic molecules to understand\n\nnature--its highways and byways, how it got to be the beautiful way it is.\n\n\n\n  Men and women seem to find ever more ingenious ways to confound\n\nthe natural-unnatural dichotomy.\n A recent sample of minor and not-so-minor changes made to molecules\n\ncritical to life gives a taste of what these molecular engineers are up to.\n\n\n\n  There was no greater chemical achievement ( even if it was\n\naccomplished by two non-chemists) in midcentury than the recognition of the\n\nstructure of DNA.\n And it has taken much ingenious work to explore fully the\n\nconsequences and workings of what James Watson and Francis Crick divined.\n But now chemists are curious.\n Why this structure and not all others?\n Albert Eschenmoser of the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich,\n\none of the deepest-thinking chemists of our time, has focused on the sugars.\n\n\n\n  Nucleic acids, including DNA and RNA, are the information\n\ncarriers of life.\n The two strands of DNA, a marvelous biopolymer, are each a chain of\n\nphosphates ( PO4) alternating with sugar rings made up of carbons and a\n\nsingle oxygen.\n Coming off the rings are flat platelet-like molecular units, the \"\n\nbases\" that are the letters of the genetic alphabet: adenine ( A), guanine (\n\nG), cytosine ( C), and thymine ( T, in DNA) or uracil ( U, in RNA).\n The sequence of the bases within one strand codes the message; the\n\npairing of the bases in that strand with specific partners in the other\n\nstrand is the mechanism for replication.\n The bases encode the information; the sugar rings are part of the\n\nbackbone of the spiral ladder. \n\n  Because the sugars of RNA and DNA are made of five carbons ( four\n\nin the ring and one more outside), chemists, prone just occasionally to fits\n\nof rationality in nomenclature, have called them pentoses.\n Much more common than the pentoses, however, are the six-carbon\n\nsugars called hexoses ( containing a ring of five carbons and an oxygen, with\n\nan extra carbon outside the ring).\n An example is common glucose, maybe one of the few healthy delights\n\nleft us. \n\n  Eschenmoser argues convincingly that hexoses are not just popular\n\ntoday but were more than likely to have formed under prebiological\n\nconditions.\n Why, then, he asks, did nature choose pentoses and not hexoses as the\n\nsugar building blocks of nucleic acids? \n\n  The Swiss chemist follows up the question with . . . synthesis.\n He and his able co-workers build up an entire alternative universe,\n\nconstructing not just the sugars but single-stranded phosphate-sugar chains\n\nas well.\n They add the bases.\n\n\n  The alternative world in their grasp, the chemists look for\n\ndifferences.\n These are easy to find.\n The beauty and efficient replication properties of the pentose\n\nuniverse ( natural, ours) derive from the bases being cradled within a helix\n\nand perpendicular to it.\n And that cradling in turn can be traced to the angle at which the\n\nbases come off the sugar, relative to the chain axis formed by the phosphates\n\nand part of the pentose ring.\n Notice how in the hexose universe ( unnatural, and even more so ours)\n\nthe bases are attached at a very different angle.\n Computer modeling and experiment show that the hexose-DNA does not\n\nform helical structures.\n Hexose-DNA strands pair differently, pair more strongly, and thus are\n\nmuch less prone to the ready pairing-unpairing that is characteristic of\n\nnormal pentose-DNA.\n The alternative universe is just not good enough, so it seems, to do\n\nwhat has been done. \n\n  Not too far from Eschenmoser, in the same laboratories in Zurich,\n\nSteven Benner is playing with nature in another way.\n Recall the four bases, G, C, A, and T ( U).\n These bases come together, through hydrogen bonds, in specific pairs.\n A fits with T ( or U, in RNA) like the clasp on a necklace; it will\n\nnot pair with G or C.\n G and C are, likewise, perfectly and monogamously matched.\n This pairing is the heart of the replication mechanism that is needed\n\nif information is to be passed along.\n A sequence of three bases translates into an amino acid of a protein.\n So GCU codes the eventual synthesis of an alanine, and GGU gets us a\n\nglycine.\n In this way the very specific amino acid sequences of the protein\n\nchemical factories of our bodies are built up. \n\n  Benner 's group thought that nature 's alphabet might be extended.\n So they designed another base pair, k ( kappa) and X, to fit into the\n\ndouble helix.\n Neither k nor X pairs with known bases, so the new letters do not sow\n\nconfusion; they just extend the alphabet from four letters to six. \n\n  The new letters give the potential for--but don't guarantee--\n\nincreased richness in the genetic vocabulary.\n Nature chooses four letters.\n Would six produce a richer universe of proteins?\n I don't know the answer.\n English is a richer language in number of words than either French or\n\nAnglo-Saxon, but that 's no guarantee that you'll wri 'llgreat literature in\n\nEnglish.\n Still, it 's interesting to try to create a new language and see if\n\nyou can make some new words with it.\n The analogue of making new words is making new molecules.\n It 's possible you could in this way make some new proteins that could\n\nbe interesting drugs, that could be different in some slight way. \n\n  Put more letters, weird new ones, into English, and you can\n\ncertainly make more words.\n But they'll b 'llonsense, or near nonsense.\n With time, if needed, those additional letters may shape new words,\n\nnew meanings in a richer language of the future.\n So the expanded genetic alphabet needs to pass through the selection\n\nprocess of evolution before it begins to create molecules more diverse, more\n\nversatile, than the ones we already have. \n\n  There is a kind of chutzpah in Benner 's game, but it sure is\n\npretty. \n\n  Still more molecular games are afoot, this time with proteins.\n Proteins are biopolymers built up from long chains of linked amino\n\nacids.\n A piece of a protein, assembled from two or more of these amino\n\nacids, is called a peptide.\n Imagine each amino acid as a tool with a bit and two sources of\n\nattachment ( see preceding page).\n These two \" handles\" are always the same--an amino ( NH2) and an acid\n\n( COOH)--and they allow one peptide to link up, interchangeably, with others.\n But the bits come in 20 different varieties, called R groups.\n The differences create variety, like different tool bits on the same\n\nmachine, allowing for different functions.\n If the R group is a single hydrogen, H, then the resulting amino\n\nacid is glycine ( gelatin is full of it); when it 's CH3--three hydrogens and\n\na carbon--then the amino acid is alanine, which is especially common in silk\n\nfibers.\n When it 's CH2CH2COOH, the amino acid is glutamate; replace the last\n\nH by a sodium and you'v 'veot the primary ingredient for the MSG--natural or\n\nunnatural--that produces your headache. \n\n  Stuart Schreiber at Harvard and Jon Clardy at Cornell have\n\ndesigned a set of stretched, or \" vinylogous,\" peptides.\n You see the same handles that confer the ability to form a chain at\n\nthe ends.\n But in the middle there is something different, two extra carbons\n\nsewed in, with a second R on one of them, providing potentially more variety\n\nthan the single R group of a normal amino acid.\n The two-carbon spacer in the chain also gives the polymer the\n\nability to fold up in a way similar to, but different from, normal protein\n\nfolding.\n What could these modified peptides do?\n They would be the same and not the same, and among them some might\n\nfool and subdue the pathogens that threaten our well-being. \n\n  For example, enzymes are protein powerhouses built up bit by bit\n\nby the peptide pieces.\n They bind some molecule and then do chemistry with it.\n The binding often depends on their recognizing just one piece of the\n\nmolecule, not the whole thing.\n You could conceivably make a molecule with one piece that would be\n\nrecognized, but with another piece that would throw a wrench into the works\n\nand essentially shut down the molecular factory.\n So being slightly unnatural can be very dangerous--to harmful\n\nbacteria, we hope. \n\n  Incredibly, a molecule that strongly resembles one of these\n\nvinylogous peptides has turned up in nature, in a marine sponge; in humans\n\nthe peptide inhibits blood clotting.\n This discovery offered strong psychological support to the chemists.\n They thought they were making things that were very far out, but it\n\nturned out that nature had played that same variation on a theme.\n All the more reason to believe that a library of such modified\n\npeptides might be of value in drug design. \n\n  The three examples I picked of chemists ringing changes on\n\nnature are not peripheral; they touch on central issues of biology.\n Eschenmoser 's work deals with the structural prerequisites for the\n\nstorage and replication of molecular information.\n Benner 's touches on the transcription of this information from one\n\nbiopolymer family to another.\n Clardy and Schreiber, meanwhile, study the type of structure created\n\nfrom this information. \n\n  The motivations of the chemists engaged in this work are clear.\n First, there is the sense of wonder.\n Why did nature do it this way and not another?\n What if I change things just a little?\n The power to effect such change is in our hands.\n\n\n  Then there is benefit and its sidekick, profit.\n Some of these molecules may be useful drugs just because they are\n\nsmall variations on a natural theme.\n When curiosity and benefit find themselves on the same trail, the\n\nhands and minds of human beings seem to quicken.\n You can see this in the current flurry of activity in the making of\n\nslightly unnatural molecules. \n\n  Yet some people are scared by these molecular games, as they are\n\nby genetic engineering.\n The range of concerns is wide: even if there are safeguards against\n\nletting loose possible new pathogens, even if these molecules save lives or\n\nimprove our standard of living, what right do we have to tamper with a\n\nGod-given universe?", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "97f78f4d-d8c5-488c-a807-6524680e8b15", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.656655+00:00"}

television\n\nsystems, the need for channels to attract loyal viewers increases.\n Auletta ( 1991) outlined the revolutionary impact of channel\n\nfragmentation on the Big Three networks, noting that they could \" never\n\nrecapture their monopoly\"(p. 571). \n\n  The theoretical implications of channel repertoire are even more\n\ncompelling.\n The portrayal of viewers as passive couch potatoes has been popular\n\nfor many years because watching television involves some nonselective\n\nbehavior.\n However, research has demonstrated that viewers have been quite\n\nactive when there were only a few viewing choices ( Bechtel, Achelpohl, &\n\nAkers, 1971), and they are still very active in the more current multichannel\n\nenvironment ( Ferguson, 1990). \n\n\n  The construct of channel repertoire can be operationalized in at\n\nleast three different ways. \n\n  is the number of channels with\n\nwhich a viewer is familiar ( Heeter & Greenberg, 1988).\n Channel familiarity is assessed by asking respondents to freely\n\nindicate the channels they remember being able to receive ( Greenberg,\n\nSrigley, Baldwin, & Heeter, 1988; Heeter, 1985, 1988).\n Channel familiarity is not a measure of viewing behavior because\n\nfamiliarity is not the same as use.\n Although viewers should be more familiar with the channels they\n\nwatch, some viewers may be aware of channels ( especially well publicized\n\ncable channels such as CNN, ESPN, Nickelodeon, and MTV) that they do not\n\nwatch.\n Channel familiarity is most likely related to levels of promotion and\n\npublicity. \n\n  presents a roster of channels\n\nfrom which a viewing repertoire can be recalled.\n Aided channel repertoire is probably the most accurate measure of\n\nviewing behavior because it most closely reflects ratings data, although it\n\nmay be affected by cable channel alignment stability.\n Thus, aided channel repertoire is useful to media industries and to\n\nresearchers interested in accurate measures of audience size and demographic\n\nmakeup. \n\n  asks respondents to list,\n\nwithout any prompts, the channels they view regularly.\n The answers may provide the most valid data of channel repertoire,\n\nbut they are susceptible to temporary memory lapse that may cause omission of\n\nsalient channels.\n Greenberg, Heeter, and Lin ( 1988) noted that \" unaided recall\n\nprovides a smaller set of channels in the channel repertoire of the\n\nindividual viewer\" ( p. 197).\n Thus, unaided channel repertoire is the most conservative measure of\n\nviewing. \n\n  It is important to distinguish channel familiarity, aided channel\n\nrepertoire, and unaided channel repertoire because the different\n\noperationalizations have different theoretical implications.\n Channel familiarity is not a measure of viewing behavior but a\n\nmeasure of channel awareness.\n Although aided channel repertoire is the most accurate measure of\n\nviewing behavior, it does not distinguish between salient channels and less\n\nmemorable channels.\n Aided channel repertoire may include channels that are used only\n\nrarely or as background and without full attention, because they are not top\n\nof mind.\n Unaided channel repertoire, on the other hand, suggests that exposure\n\nto those channels may be more mindful and frequent because those channels may\n\nbe a regular part of television viewing. \n\n  A primary distinction between aided and unaided channel\n\nrepertoire can be traced to the level of audience behavior.\n Researchers interested in reflections of gross audience behavior\n\ntypically find aided channel repertoire measures appropriate because they\n\nmost closely reflect ratings data.\n Although aided channel repertoire is not a clear operationalization\n\nof gross audience behavior, it is useful to macro-level research interests\n\nthat focus on media economics, target marketing, and communication policy and\n\npublic interest ( Webster & Lichty, 1991). \n\n  Some media researchers, however, are less interested in gross\n\nexposure to different channels and are more concerned with the audiences\n\ncognitive processing and psychological effects of specific media content.\n For those purposes, aided channel repertoire is less precise than\n\nunaided channel repertoire because it does not reflect psychological aspects\n\nof the audience, such as attention to, impressions of, or involvement with\n\ntelevision content.\n This approach focuses more on individual selection of television\n\ncontent and the psychological processes that influence audience 's cognitive\n\nand emotional reactions to what they view ( Bryant & Zillmann, 1991). \n\n  Webster and Lichty ( 1991 ) account for these two perspectives in\n\ntheir model of television viewing behavior.\n According to their model, there are two general influences on\n\naudience behavior.\n Structural determinants include media factors, such as the number of\n\nchannel options, and audience availability ( i.e., the amount of time\n\navailable to watch television).\n Individual determinants include the needs, tastes, and preferences of\n\nindividual audience members.\n Macro- and micro-level perspectives place different emphases on\n\ndifferent aspects of the model.\n When researchers are interested in macro- level issues and measures\n\nof overall audience behavior, structural determinants are more important.\n When researchers are interested in micro-level issues,\n\nindividual-level factors become more useful. \n\n  This article focuses on aided and unaided channel repertoire as\n\nreflections of audience behaviors and builds on past research about viewing\n\nbehaviors and channel selection.\n We used the Webster-Lichty model of television viewing behavior to\n\npredict that media and audience factors would differentially explain aided\n\nand unaided channel repertoires. \n\n\n  Total channel repertoire ( TCR) is the number of channels that\n\nviewers remember watching if aided recall is used.\n Webster and Lichty ( 1991 ) noted that TCR is related to the number\n\nof channels offered.\n As channel availability increases, so does channel repertoire.\n But, as the number of channels increases, the proportion of available\n\nchannels used decreases.\n What factors should predict total channel repertoire?\n A foundation for such prediction was laid by Webster and Lichty 's (\n\n1991 ) model of audience television viewing behavior which points out two\n\nmajor influences on channel repertoire: media factors and audience\n\navailability. \n\n  Within the category of media factors, there are two obvious\n\nvariables of cable television subscription and remote control device ( RCD)\n\nownership.\n Heeter ( 1985) found that TCR is predicted by cable television\n\nsubscription.\n Ferguson ( 1992a) confirmed the influence of cable subscription and\n\nalso noted the influence of RCD ownership.\n Remote control devices are an increasingly important element of the\n\nnew media environment ( Ferguson, 1992a; Walker & Bellamy, 1991).\n In 1990, the penetration of remote control reached 77.0% in U.S.\n\ntelevision households ( Shagrin, 1990), compared to 70.2% for the VCR ( \" In\n\nBrief,\" 1991 ) and 61.2% for cable ( Sheridan, 1991). \n\n  Within the category of audience availability, there are two\n\nvariables of television exposure and channel changing.\n Audience availability usually refers to the number of people\n\navailable to watch television. But, it can also refer to the accessibility\n\nof television content.\n So, higher levels of television viewing and channel changing may make\n\nmore channels available to viewers. \n\n  Ainslie ( 1988) reported on \" grazing\" ( flipping through\n\nchannels with remote control devices) as a new way of watching television\n\nthat makes more channels available to viewers.\n He found that viewers with remote control devices have significantly\n\nhigher TCRs than viewers without RCDs. \n\n \n\n  H1: Total channel repertoire will be predicted by ( a) media\n\nfactors ( cable subscription and RCD ownership); and ( b) audience\n\navailability ( television exposure and channel changing). \n\n\n  Mindful channel repertoire ( MCR) is the number of channels that\n\nviewers freely recall watching ( i.e., unaided).\n Mindful channel repertoire is generally smaller than total channel\n\nrepertoire ( Greenberg, Heeter, & Lin, 19813).\n Based on models of free recall in cognitive psychology, MCR indicates\n\nthat channels have been accessed frequently, recently, or committed to\n\nlong-term memory ( Klatzky, 1980).\n Mindful channel repertoire also reflects a more active use of\n\ntelevision, because channels are remembered without prompts and are at top of\n\nmind.\n Thus, viewers are more aware of channels whose programs are actively\n\nprocessed during exposure ( Bahrick, 1979). \n\n  It is clear that MCR is influenced by media structure and\n\naudience availability variables.\n Cable subscription increases channel options, and greater television\n\nexposure increases opportunity to watch different channels.\n But, because MCR is a micro-level aspect of television viewing, MCR\n\nshould also be explained by individual-level factors of the Webster and\n\nLichty ( 1991) model.\n In this study, we focused on individual manifestations of audience\n\nactivity in addition to media structure and audience availability. \n\n  Audience activity describes how intentionally and purposely\n\npeople select and use media technologies and content.\n Audience activity has been a central assumption of the uses and\n\ngratifications perspective ( Katz, Blumler, & Gurevitch, 1974).\n Audience members are seen as active because they select and use media\n\ncontent to satisfy specific communication needs.\n Scholars, however, have expanded understanding of audience activity\n\nby suggesting that audience members are variably active along several\n\ndifferent dimensions ( Blumler,1979; Levy & Windahl, 1984, 1985).\n Scholars have investigated influences on audience activity ( Levy &\n\nWindahl,1984; Perse,1990a; Rubin & Perse,1987b), outcomes of audience\n\nactivity ( Perse,1990b; Rubin & Perse,1987a), and audience activity in the\n\nnewer media environment ( Ferguson, 1992a; Levy, 1987; Lin, 1990;\n\nPerse,1990a).\n From this literature, we selected five variables to examine in this\n\nstudy: television viewing motives, intentionality, affinity, effort, and\n\nmotivations for changing channels. \n\n  Rubin ( 1984) has argued\n\nthat television viewing motives are a primary signal of audience activity.\n Ritualistic television use, which is marked by watching to pass time\n\nor out of habit, is a nonselective and less active use of television that\n\nfocuses on using television as a medium, not specific content.\n Instrumental use, on the other hand, reflects selective and purposive\n\nexposure to specific content ( see also Rubin & Perse, 1987b).\n Instrumental viewing motives, such as viewing to seek information,\n\nentertainment, and excitement, are also related to higher levels of\n\ntelevision exposure ( Rubin,1981, 1983) and exposure to several different\n\nprogram types, such as news, action-adventure, comedy, documentaries,\n\nmagazine shows, drama, serials, sports, talk shows, and game shows (\n\nRubin,1981,1983; Rubin & Rubin,19@2).1983) and exposure to several different\n\nprogram types, such as news, action-adventure, comedy, documentaries,\n\nmagazine shows, drama, serials, sports, talk.\n Ritualistic and instrumental viewing motives should be linked\n\ndifferentially to TCR and MCR.\n Ritualistic viewing motives are related to higher levels of exposure\n\nto television and exposure to a wide variety of different program types (\n\nRubin,1981,1983,1984).\n So, ritualistic motives might be positively related to TCR.\n But, ritualistic motives may not be related to awareness of the\n\nchannels watched.\n Heeter ( 1985) reported that many people claimed that they did not\n\nknow which channels they watched, \" I don't know, I just watch TV\" ( p.22).\n She observed that channel familiarity was negatively linked to\n\nviewing television for habitual reasons.\n Ritualistic viewing motives should be associated with lower MCR\n\nbecause ritualistic television use is inattentive to content and accompanied\n\nby distracting activities ( Perse,1990a; Rubin & Perse,1987b). \n\n  Unlike ritualistic motives, instrumental motives should be linked\n\nto greater awareness of the channels that are watched, because instrumental\n\nuse of television is more active and aware.\n In general, an instrumental use of television is reflected in more\n\nuse of program guides to plan viewing, greater planning of time to watch\n\nspecific programs, and more thought about program content ( Perse,1990a).\n The greater planning, effort, and awareness suggests that\n\ninstrumental television use would be associated with higher MCR. \n\n  .\n Intentional media use is planned and purposive.\n Intentionality is reflected in program guide use ( Gantz & Eastman,\n\n1983) and \" making appointments\" to watch news ( Levy, 1978) and soap operas\n\n( Lemish, 1985).\n Intentionality is also associated with greater attention to programs\n\nduring exposure ( Rubin, Perse, & Taylor, 1988).\n Because intentionality is linked to greater awareness of programming\n\nalternatives and to plans to watch specific programs, intentionality should\n\nbe associated with greater awareness of the channels that are watched. \n\n  Affinity is another aspect of audience\n\nactivity.\n Affinity reflects the importance that viewers place on television\n\nand its content.\n Affinity has been linked to higher levels of television exposure (\n\nRubin, 1983), to higher levels of channel changing ( Wenner, 1990), and to a\n\nmore active use of television news ( Rubin & Perse, 1987b).\n Because affinity is related to individual media factors and to\n\ngreater television importance, affinity should be linked to higher mindful\n\nchannel repertoires. \n\n  Effort is a goal-directed cognitive activity.\n Cognitive effort directs selective attention to specific aspects of\n\na situation ( Kahneman, 1973).\n Effort is reflected in conscious, controlled, and voluntary mental\n\nactivity ( Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977).\n Effort also influences what children learn from print and television\n\n( Salomon & Leigh, 1984).\n Because effort marks greater attention and awareness, we expect\n\ncognitive effort to be associated with awareness of channels watched.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b822c7ae-14a8-4549-87d5-b4e699aa2b83", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.658173+00:00"}
{"text": "For 160 million years reptiles flew above the Earth.\n For just over 200 years we humans have known something of their\n\nexistence.\n But only recently have we really begun to understand their lives--or\n\ntheir looks.\n\n  THE FOSSIL SKULL sitting on Alexander Kellner 's worktable makes no\n\nsense.\n Usually fossils are spark plugs in the engine of the imagination.\n One look at the long, gently curved bones of a spider monkey 's arm and\n\nyou see a graceful swing from branch to branch; one glance at the weighty leg\n\nbones of a mastodon and you hear the rumble of a heavy stride.\n But this skull greets you with cognitive dissonance: all you see is\n\nessentially a flat triangle of bone.\n \" A paleontologist once came in here and said, ` What is that?'\" says\n\nKellner, himself a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History\n\nin New York.\n\n  Slowly, though, with Kellner 's guidance, the details that will\n\ngive this triangle meaning emerge.\n There is a pair of large eye sockets midway along the skull, staring\n\nout of a braincase the size of a child 's head; the straight, smooth daggers\n\nin front now become a set of jaws.\n Most prominent on the skull is a crest of bone that starts at the tip\n\nof the creature 's beak; it rises above the upper jaw, passes over and behind\n\nthe eyes, and shoots out behind the skull like an oar.\n The crest doubles the length of the skull, from two feet to four.\n How could any creature support such a burden?\n \" It was hollow,\" Kellner says simply, picking up a piece of the\n\ncrest to show how the bone is only a few hundredths of an inch thick in some\n\nplaces.\n While the crest 's interior is now filled with rock, in life there was\n\nonly air.\n\n\n  This skull belonged to a pterosaur--an extinct flying\n\nreptile--named Tupuxuara, and it is one of the latest additions to an\n\ninventory of more than 100 pterosaur species known to paleontologists.\n Tupuxuara lived 110 million years ago in what is now Brazil.\n It had wings measuring 18 feet from tip to tip, over 6 feet longer\n\nthan the wings of the largest living bird, the albatross.\n Yet since many of its bones were as thin as its crest, it weighed no\n\nmore than 45 pounds.\n\n  For the most part, Kellner says, Tupuxuara soared, but from time\n\nto time it would flap its wings to stay aloft.\n With its sharp eyes it would scan the broad lagoons below for food.\n The fern-and-pine-lined shores of these lagoons were home to many\n\nother species of pterosaurs, as well as dinosaurs, turtles, crocodiles,\n\nbirds, and amphibians.\n Most important to Tupuxuara, the lagoons were teeming with fish.\n With a few precise adjustments to its wings, it would dip down to the\n\nsurface of the water, pluck a fish, and gulp it as it flew away.\n\n  If, in Kellner 's telling, this pterosaur 's behavior comes off as\n\nremarkably birdlike, it is no accident.\n According to much of the newest research by the small number of\n\npterosaur enthusiasts worldwide, these extinct reptiles in many ways mirrored\n\nthe habits of their far more familiar successors in the sky.\n Pterosaur flight, the researchers say, was like that of birds down to\n\nsubtle details; pterosaurs played many of the same roles birds do in today 's\n\necology, and pterosaurs may even have had birdlike social structures and\n\nchild-rearing techniques.\n\n  Pterosaurs haven't always been seen this way; they weren't even\n\noriginally seen as denizens of the air.\n In 1784 the Italian zoologist Cosimo Collini, trying to make sense of\n\nthe first pterosaur fossil ever found, guessed that he was looking at a sea\n\ncreature--an amphibious mammal.\n Early in the nineteenth century the French anatomist Baron Georges\n\nCuvier saw drawings of this fossil and quickly interpreted the animal as a\n\nflying reptile, but his colleagues found that concept hard to swallow.\n Throughout the 1800s researchers suggested pterosaurs were everything\n\nfrom extinct bats to flying marsupials.\n Eventually they seem to have reached consensus on the image of a\n\nlizard that, while it didn't actually fly, did glide through the air on\n\nbatlike wings.\n\n  Part of their confusion stemmed from the pterosaurs' bones.\n Hollow and thin, they were perfect for flight but not for\n\npreservation.\n Only a few sites scattered around the world have yielded many\n\npterosaur fossils that aren't badly damaged.\n Generally they are found in slabs of limestone, greatly flattened and\n\nmost often fragmented.\n\n  Now, however, beautiful pterosaur fossils are emerging from a\n\nscrubby plateau in northeastern Brazil called Chapada do Araripe.\n The site itself isn't newfound.\n Two wandering naturalists discovered it in 1817, and paleontologists\n\nhave been hauling out fossil fish, amphibians, insects, and plants ever\n\nsince.\n But not until 1971 was the first pterosaur discovered at Araripe, and\n\nmost of the other pterosaur fossils there have been uncovered within just the\n\npast ten years.\n Fourteen new species, including Tupuxuara, have now been found at\n\nAraripe, each dramatically different from all previously known\n\npterosaurs.\n\n  The Araripe pterosaurs are miraculously preserved.\n For reasons geochemists still don't fully understand, animals that\n\ndied in the lagoons of Araripe sometimes began to fossilize unusually\n\nquickly.\n In other ancient lagoons, bones that sank to the bottom were covered\n\nin mud and gradually crushed as the mud accumulated and turned to stone.\n But when an animal died in the Araripe water, it was quickly coated\n\nwith a layer of sediment.\n Layer after layer of limestone built up on the bones, encasing them\n\nin large, round nodules.\n How quickly the nodules formed is hard to say, but judging from the\n\npresence of fossilized muscle and sometimes even bacteria on the skin of\n\nAraripe animals, it could have happened within hours.\n It 's as if nature were packing away fine china for 110 million years.\n When paleontologists unearth these pale lumps, crack them open, and\n\nsoak away the limestone, they often find fossils with unprecedented\n\nthree-dimensional detail.\n\n  Kellner is one of the world 's experts on the Araripe pterosaurs,\n\nand he doesn't conceal his pride in them.\n \" Paleontologists always like to say ` My fossils are the best,'\" he\n\nsays, \" but these really are the best.\u001d\n\n Stafford Howse, a paleontologist at the University of London,\n\nrecently finished a study of a pterosaur skull from Araripe that is preserved\n\ndown to its ear bones.\n \" If the thing had died six months ago,\" he says, \" and been buried\n\nin the soil for the worms and maggots to get to and had then been exhumed,\n\nthis is the condition it would be in.\n\n\n  As far as paleontologists can now determine, pterosaurs descended\n\nfrom a small, lightweight bipedal reptile that lived perhaps 250 million\n\nyears ago, an animal that also gave rise to dinosaurs ( and thus, most\n\npaleontologists believe, ultimately to birds) at around the same time.\n How pterosaurs evolved toward flight is unknown; they may have made\n\ntheir first faltering attempts by leaping from the ground or by tumbling out\n\nof trees.\n All researchers can say with certainty is that 225 million years ago\n\nthere were pterosaurs, which were fully qualified fliers.\n\n  THE FIRST PTEROSAURS were small, ranging from robin to sea gull\n\nsize.\n They generally had long, narrow heads filled with teeth.\n Most notably they possessed a finger on each hand--their \"\n\npinkie\"--that was longer than their entire body; this outsize appendage\n\nsupported a wing.\n Their other three fingers were perfectly normal and tipped with\n\nclaws.\n Trailing behind them was a long tail that, like the tail on a kite,\n\nstabilized their flight.\n They probably ate fish as a rule, although some may also have eaten\n\ninsects.\n At some point on the evolutionary path from their cold-blooded\n\nancestors they must have become warm-blooded, because otherwise they wouldn't\n\nhave had enough sustained energy to fly.\n Bolstering this notion, and giving strong hints of what they looked\n\nlike when alive, is a pterosaur fossil found in Russia in 1970 that shows\n\nsigns of a thick coat of fur.\n\n  This standard pterosaur model persisted for 45 million years.\n But around 180 million years ago a new version made its appearance.\n These newer pterosaurs are called pterodactyloids ( from the name\n\ngiven to the first member of the group found, Pterodactylus, or \" wing\n\nfinger\"; the older pterosaurs are referred to as rhamphorhynchoids).\n Pterodactyloids manifested some significant changes:\n Their long head grew still longer, yet, because it had lost some\n\nbones in the skull, it became even more lightweight.\n Their neck became flexible and birdlike.\n They lost some or all of their teeth.\n Most important, their tail shrank to a stump, making it useless for\n\nstabilizing flight.\n The only way that tail loss can be explained, say paleontologists, is\n\nby pterodactyloids' having developed more sophisticated brains capable of\n\nstabilizing flight with quick, small changes to the wings.\n\n  For more than 30 million years pterodactyloids remained\n\nrelatively rare.\n But 144 million years ago, for reasons unknown, their primitive\n\nrelatives vanished, and at that point the pterodactyloids exploded into a\n\nstrange diversity of species.\n Some became enormous--one late species named Quetzalcoatlus was 39\n\nfeet across, making it by far the largest animal ever to fly.\n Other pterodactyloids developed extremely peculiar heads: one species\n\nhad hundreds of bristles for teeth; another had a duck bill, another a spoon\n\nbill.\n Many pterodactyloids had bizarre crests like upuxuara 's; some had\n\ncrests shaped like swords, others like keels.\n\n  For all the hallucinatory appeal of pterosaur heads, however, it\n\nis the creatures' method of flight that remains the central question for\n\npaleontologists.\n Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to fly, and only two other\n\nanimals have since joined them in the air: birds and bats.\n By comparing the bones of all three creatures, paleontologists have\n\ntried to draw analogies that might suggest exactly how pterosaurs flew.\n Judging from the bones in the shoulder region, researchers have\n\nconcluded that the extinct reptiles could have flapped their wings as\n\npowerfully as a bird or a bat.\n\n  Yet the analogies can go only so far.\n Bird and bat wings themselves are very different from each other.\n In birds, the wings are made of feathers with stiff shafts that are\n\nrooted in the arms and the fused fingers of the hands.\n The wings of bats are made of elastic membranes that run between four\n\nelongated fingers and reach all the way down to the feet.\n By moving their feet and fingers, bats control the shape and tautness\n\nof the wings.\n\n  Pterosaur wings, supported by that single outlandish finger,\n\ncould not have been really close to either of these models.\n Something had to give the wings support, to keep them from flapping\n\nuselessly in the wind.\n Either the wings had to be stiffened internally or they had to be\n\ntied down to legs or feet.\n But we have no perfectly preserved soft-tissue fossil to tell us.\n The best clues come from 80 fossil impressions of wings left behind\n\nin the mud.\n Unfortunately these tracings do not provide researchers with any\n\ndefinitive answers.\n Usually the wings became distorted and were pulled into unnatural\n\npositions in death, and without exception their impressions are maddeningly\n\nambiguous.\n In many of the fossils it 's not even clear if the impressions were\n\nmade by a wing or by some other soft tissue folded into a provocative\n\nposition by accidental events.\n But since the nineteenth century, paleontologists, observing that\n\npterosaur wings looked as if they were made of a membrane like that of a bat,\n\nhave assumed that the creatures did in fact sport leathery wings that ran,\n\nlike a bat 's, from finger to feet.\n\n  For more than a decade paleontologist Kevin Padian, of the\n\nUniversity of California at Berkeley, has been vigorously fighting this view.\n \" If you' 'rechoosing between the bat and bird analogy,\" he says, \"\n\nthere are many more reasons to draw comparisons with birds.\u001d\n Batlike pterosaur wings would show a clear attachment to the foot,\n\nhe says, perhaps with a notch in one of the bones, but he has seen none.\n A bat 's wing also has a tendon running along its trailing edge, but\n\nthere is no evidence of one in pterosaur fossils.\n\n  There is evidence, however, of a different sort of structural\n\ncomponent.\n Paleontologists have long noted that some pterosaur fossil wings\n\nbear thin parallel ridges.\n Peter Wellnhofer, the curator of the Bavarian State Museum in\n\nMunich, argued in 1987 that these ridges represent tough fibers, possibly\n\nmade of the protein collagen, sandwiched inside the wing to provide\n\nstiffness.\n Recently, Padian and Jeremy Rayner, a zoologist at the University of\n\nBristol in England, found that the tips of pterosaur wings support this idea.\n Since bats have an elastic membrane that they pull tight, their wing\n\ncomes to a sharp point.\n But while studying a particularly well preserved pterosaur in\n\nGermany, Padian and Rayner discovered that its wing tip forms a blunted\n\ncurve.\n Such a shape requires some internal stiffening, such as could have\n\nbeen provided by fibers.\n\n  This pterosaur had been preserved in a belly-up position,\n\nexposing the underside of its wings.\n Padian and Rayner found that at the trailing edge some of the fibers\n\nhad apparently separated from the wing and were lying on top of it at an\n\nangle, leaving behind corresponding grooves on the wing itself.\n The way the fibers had frayed indicates that rather than being\n\nsandwiched inside the wing, as many paleontologists had imagined, they lined\n\nthe underside like the ribbing of an umbrella.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d817967a-59f8-4c74-b043-bb175484b3eb", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.659770+00:00"}

- you have a hall full of close\n\nrelatives before you can ask any friends.\n\n\n  The picture of Jack in the shirt and tie was taken in Ford 's\n\nliving room just before the wedding and they were trying to organize groups\n\nto have professional pictures taken, thus the grim look on his face.\n The picture of Lydia and her mother I took ( I can never get a job as\n\na professional photographer and you can see why) in the living room.\n The dress Lydia wore was her mother 's wedding dress - - candlelight\n\nand the embroidery around the neck was sparkly.\n\n  The sign was on the side of the house by the walkway to the back\n\nyard.\n The guitarist played soft Indian music prior to the ceremony - - the\n\nman whose back is in the picture is Robert Ford, Jr., a cousin of Lydia 's who\n\nis a Shakespearean actor with the Globe Theatre group in NYC - gave a reading\n\nand was terrific.\n Prior to the ceremony Mario went and talked to a neighbor in back who\n\nwas sawing and hammering and asked him if he would stop about 12:30 because\n\nthere was going to be a wedding.\n He was very nice and did stop and never started again that day.\n ( Probably he was looking for an excuse to quit so he could go play\n\ngolf as it was a gorgeous sunny warm day).\n The minister was a delightful young lady .\n She had gotten married the previous year - her husband was the\n\nMinister at at Methodist Church and she had gotten a job as youth director at\n\na United Church of Christ ( Congregational).\n She was most enthusiastic and happy during the entire ceremony--\n\nenjoyed her job.\n The picture of the group in chairs watching the ceremony is the 10\n\nmonth old son of Scott ( he does look older than that, doesn't he), sitting\n\non his father, Scott 's, lap, his mother ( forgot her name, too), youngest\n\nFord son and his wife Abby, mother and father of bride and I don't know the\n\nrest of them.\n There is a picture of Jack, Lydia and the nurse on the Indian\n\nreservation so you can see her better - - believe they are very close friends\n\nof the family as she told me they were not relatives.\n The bald headed man sitting next to Maggie eating the lunch is the\n\nShakespearean actor.\n The fellow with the hat at the table with us is Scott the graphic\n\nartist and those men who had bald heads grabbed hats as the sun was super\n\nstrong that day.\n The wedding cake was a work of art - - highly untraditional and\n\nDELICIOUS.\n ( I told Bob it reminded me of the volcano Bobby made in 6th grade\n\nfor the Science Fair).\n Mario took my camera and took most of the pictures.\n Another amusing incident when I got the camera back I asked Joe ( who\n\nstill had his suit Jacket on) if he would put it in his pocket.\n He had told me at the motel the Jacket was old and he was about to\n\nretire it ( I told him it still looked nice) and then he said that the Jacket\n\nwas so cheap it didn't have any pockets.\n We all had a good laugh because he had never pulled the stitching out\n\nof the pockets and really didn't believe me until a few other people told him\n\nthe same thing.\n\n  That about covers the people pictures, but the last group are\n\nones I bet no one else took to show you.\n I took pictures of the living room as a lead in to the pictures of\n\nthe basement.\n The painting was done by the father impressionist or whatever.\n Than the rest are pie India, all on display in the living room.\n The one statues in the corner ( 3) are Indian, the mask on a table is\n\nAfrican and Lydia 's father modeled it for us - used to spit smoke and fire\n\nout of the mouth and worn by a medicine man.\n You leave the living room and go down the basement stairs and there\n\nare 9000, yes that is right 9000 golf clubs in his basement.\n If he does not have a club it does not exist.\n Mario succombed and bought a bag - you can see it in one of the\n\npictures-- multi-colored and a set of irons from him.\n These clubs he buys and sells, but off the living room had had\n\nanother room-a study full of \" collector 's club\" - - valued at thousands of\n\ndollars.\n I asked Lydia 's mother how she did her laundry as the washing machine\n\nwas off the golf club room in the basement.\n She told me she tells him the day before she is going to wash and he\n\nhas to clear a path for her.\n All in all we had a wonderful time and I really enjoyed being with\n\nyour family and the Ford 's are delightful.\n\n  I finally got my car back - - Bobby flew down to get it and drove\n\nit home.\n What a fiasco and it would take another page or two to tell you all\n\nabout that.\n We are leaving Wednesday for North Carolina so Bob can play golf with\n\nSal Morton at his Member-Guest.\n Marisa is flying up from Florida so we will spend a few days with her\n\nand then be back here by July 2.\n Golly- - what happened to June.\n You are both in our thoughts and prayers and we hope things are going\n\nbetter for you, Mona.\n Bobby and Donna have found a house in Monett to buy and it also has\n\nan office building on the grounds - - perfect for them price-wise, too.\n Now they are trying to get a loan and Bobby has a few black marks - -\n\none of which is taking bankruptcy 5 years ago.\n\n\n  He also told me as soon as they had a home, they would start a\n\nfamily.\n They have been looking for THE house for over a year and their\n\nbiological clocks are running out so they had better move in and get\n\nstarted.\n Love and hugs to you both from Taylorville - hope to see you in\n\nAugust.\n\n Dear Family and Friends,</h\n\n  As the time to mail Christmas cards gets closer, we thought we\n\nwould try something different this year to let you know what has been going\n\non with the Millers.\n Several ideas came to mind right away, but the \" Home Page\" on the\n\nWorld Wide Web and the 1-800 number ( \" ...press one to hear John sing 'Home\n\nfor the Holidays'...\") did not gain a lot of family enthusiasm.\n So we decided to take the traditional approach and draft this\n\ninformative letter.\n We are extremely blessed with a happy and healthy family for which we\n\nhave a lot to be thankful.\n Our children have provided us with much joy and pride as we watched\n\nthem grow this past year.\n Nicholas, now 6, started kindergarten this fall.\n He really enjoys his school, teacher and classmates.\n His favorite subject is \" dinosaurs\" and likes to checkout books on\n\nthe subject every chance he gets.\n Bedtime is quite a chore for his mom and dad because some of the\n\nnames of the dinosaur species from his library books are not pronounceable\n\nwithout an encyclopedia.\n Meghan, who will be 4 in March, has also started school this fall.\n She is enrolled in \" Tiny Treasures\" which is a community ed.\n\npre-school program in Shoreview.\n She also enjoys the fun at school.\n She is very interested in art projects which continue to consume the\n\ninterior walled surfaces of our home.\n Stephanie, now 1 year ( time does fly), is a very busy individual.\n She is never short of a smile and is very vocal.\n She enjoys goofing off with her brother and sister.\n They make a great threesome.\n This year has been one of excitement and change for Martha and I.\n After a 7 month leave of absence from the Shady Lake Park School\n\ndistrict, Martha decided to resign from her elementary teaching position.\n A very tough decision to make but one that has been well worth it.\n She is very busy supervising the development of the three\n\naforementioned youth.\n She is also determined to complete and defend her Masters of\n\nEducation thesis in the coming year.\n I have also changed job descriptions.\n I resigned from [ -

{"text": "Until the latter part of the nineteenth century, divorce was\n\nlargely proscribed by law and shunned in practice much as still happens today\n\nin many nations including some European countries such as Italy and Ireland.6\n Most marital disruptions occurred not as a result of divorce but from\n\ndesertion or informal separation.\n Because population surveys were not available prior to the middle part\n\nof the twentieth century, it is difficult to know how often de facto divorce\n\ntook place in the United States.\n But, it seems likely that all but a small minority of marriages\n\nsurvived until the death of one or another partner, an event that typically\n\noccurred much earlier than it does today.7 Some have argued that the rise of\n\ndivorce was partly prompted by increasing survival rates, which placed a\n\ngreater strain on the ability of couples to manage marital stress or maintain\n\nmarital contentment.8\n\n\n  Divorce rates in the United States began to rise shortly after the\n\nCivil War and continued on a steady upward course for more than a century.\n Over this time rates have fluctuated, often falling in poor economic\n\ntimes and generally surging after major wars.\n But these short-term variations have been far less consequential to\n\nthe long-term pattern of constant growth.9\n Nearly two decades ago, Preston and McDonald calculated the likelihood\n\nof divorce for each marriage cohort beginning in 1867 and continuing until\n\nthe mid-1960s.10\n Their results showed a continuous trend of dissolution among\n\nsuccessive marriage cohorts.\n Roughly 5% of marriages ended in divorce just after the Civil War\n\ncompared with an estimated 36% in 1964.\n Thus, the pattern of prevalent divorce was firmly in place in this\n\ncountry even before the divorce revolution of the 1960s.</P>\n\n  Nonetheless, there was a sharp increase in the incidence of\n\ndivorce from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s.\n During a span of a decade and a half, divorce rates for married women\n\nmore than doubled ( from 10.6 per 1,000 in 1965 to 22.8 in 1979), pushing the\n\nrisk of divorce much higher for all marriage cohorts, especially those who\n\nwed after the mid-1960s.11\n Some researchers speculated that a majority of all marriages\n\ncontracted in the 1970s and after would end, especially when both informal\n\nseparations and formal divorces were counted.12\n Other researchers reached more conservative estimates but still\n\nprojected that more than two in every five marriages would end in divorce\n\nwhen divorce rates reached their peaks in the middle 1970s.9\n\n  Divorce rates began to level off in the late 1970s and actually\n\ndeclined by about 10% during the 1980s.13\n As mentioned earlier, fluctuations of this sort are common\n\nhistorically and do not necessarily signal a reversal in divorce trends.\n Nonetheless, most demographers think that divorce is not likely to\n\ncontinue its upward pattern, at least in the near term.\n There are several demographic explanations for the failure of divorce\n\nrates to increase after the 1970s which do not necessarily imply that\n\nAmericans today are becoming more committed to staying married than they were\n\nin the previous two decades.\n The huge cohort of baby boomers, reacting to changing economic\n\nopportunities, postponed marriage.9,14\n A larger proportion opted to obtain more schooling and wait to form a\n\nfamily.15\n Marriage age for women rose from just above 20 in the mid-1950s to\n\n24.4 in 1992, an increase of more than four years.16\n It has long been known that early marriage and lower education are\n\nassociated with marital instability.\n 17 Thus, the pattern of delayed marriage might have had a role in\n\ncurbing the rates of divorce.\n\n  Another potent source of marital disruption, associated with\n\nearly marriage, is premarital pregnancy.\n Fewer marriages today occur as a result of a premarital pregnancy.18\n It also seems plausible that the greater availability of\n\ncontraception and abortion in the 1970s may have discouraged the formation of\n\nearly unions, reducing the number of ill-considered marriages, though\n\nevidence to support this hypothesis is not available.\n Furthermore, the population has been getting older as the baby\n\nboomers mature.\n Older couples in long-standing marriages have a lower propensity to\n\ndivorce.19\n Thus, as the baby boomers reach middle age, a larger proportion of\n\nthose married have passed through the high-risk years, when their marriages\n\nare young and relatively more fragile.\n\n  Finally, growing rates of cohabitation before marriage may have\n\nbrought down the rate of divorce.\n As more and more couples elect to live together prior to marrying, it\n\nseems likely that many unions that would have ended in divorce end before\n\nmarriage occurs.\n That is, a growing number of Americans are divorcing without\n\nmarrying, making the official divorce statistics a less reliable barometer of\n\nunion stability.20\n\n  For all these reasons, it is probable that the modest drop in\n\ndivorce rates does not indicate a higher propensity toward marital stability.\n Instead, the composition of those marrying has changed in ways that\n\nonly make it appear that marriages are becoming more stable.\n Not so many years ago, it was common for family experts to reassure\n\nthose who were alarmed at the steady increase in divorce rates by pointing\n\nout that divorce typically is not a terminal event but a transition from one\n\nmarriage to the next.\n So it was said that couples who separated lost faith in a particular\n\nmarriage but not in the institution of matrimony.21\n In 1975, close to three-fourths of all women in their fifties who had\n\nexperienced a divorce had remarried.\n For formerly married men, the occurrence of remarriage was even\n\nhigher, about four in five eventually remarried, owing to the greater pool of\n\neligible partners.\n ( It is easier for men to attract younger partners than it is for\n\nwomen.)\n\n\n  In part, the trend toward lower remarriage rates may reflect the\n\ngreater tendency to postpone second unions as both men and women may be more\n\nwilling and able to live as single persons.\n But recent evidence from the National Survey of gests the rate of\n\nrecoupling has not declined notably.23\n Many divorced persons have become more cautious about reentering\n\nmatrimony, preferring instead to cohabit in informal and more fluid unions.\n This pattern, discussed below, poses particular problems for children\n\nwho are, to an increasing extent, being raised by quasi-stepparents who are\n\noften transitional figures in their households.\n The lower rates of remarriage may reflect a growing reluctance to\n\nformalize unions after a failed first marriage.\n Couples who remarry are known to have a higher risk of divorce than\n\ncouples entering first marriages.\n And divorces from second marriages occur more quickly than from first\n\nunions.\n Cherlin has shown that the proportion of couples who will marry,\n\ndivorce, remarry, and redivorce has risen eightfold during the course of this\n\ncentury, climbing from barely 2% of those who were born in the first decade\n\nof the twentieth century to 16% of those born after 1970.9\n Cherlin described the changing patterns of marriage, divorce, and\n\nremarriage for four birth cohorts of women ( see Figure 2 in the article by\n\nShiono and Quinn in this journal issue).\n For all but the most recent cohort, the proportion ever marrying\n\nremained relatively stable while the prevalence of divorce, remarriage, and\n\nredivorce progressively increased.\n In the youngest cohort, women born after 1970, Cherlin projects that\n\nmarriage ( and remarriage) will decline significantly and divorce will remain\n\nhigh among women who elect to marry or remarry.\n\n  Rising rates of marital instability have been experienced by all\n\nAmericans regardless of socioeconomic status, race, religious affiliation, or\n\nregion of the country.\n However, the extent of marital instability differs enormously among\n\nvarious social groups.\n It is beyond the scope of this article to explore in detail the\n\npatterns described above for different social classes, religious groups, or\n\nregions of the country.\n It is hard to ignore, however, racial/ethnic differences in patterns\n\nof marriage, divorce, and remarriage because the experiences for whites,\n\nAfrican Americans, and some Hispanic groups are so very disparate.\n African Americans have long exhibited different patterns of family\n\nformation.24\n As far back as the nineteenth century, blacks were more likely to\n\nmarry earlier, had a higher incidence of premarital pregnancy and nonmarital\n\nchildbearing, formed less stable unions, and were less likely to remarry when\n\ndisruption occurred.\n Scholars disagree on the origin of these patterns.25\n Some believe that they are rooted in different notions of kinship\n\nbrought to America; others argue that distinctive patterns of family\n\nformation emerged in slavery; and still others contend that these family\n\ndifferences did not really take hold until after Emancipation, when black\n\nAmericans were exposed to economic discrimination and racism.\n Still others argue that the differences are more recent in\n\norigin.26\n\n  Whatever the particular origin or combination of origins, there\n\nis convincing evidence that African Americans are much less likely to marry,\n\nmore likely to divorce, and less likely to remarry when divorce occurs.27\n More than 90% of whites will marry compared with about 75% of African\n\nAmericans; of those who do wed, African Americans have a substantially higher\n\nrisk of divorce.13\n Ten years after marriage, 47% of blacks have separated or divorced\n\ncompared with 28% of non- Hispanic whites.\n Blacks are also far less likely to remarry after separating.\n As a result, African Americans spend far less time in marriage than\n\ndo whites.28\n Much less information exists on the marriage patterns of other racial\n\nand ethnic groups.\n Census data on Hispanics suggest that their levels of marriage,\n\ndivorce, and remarriage fall somewhere between those of whites and those of\n\nblacks.13\n However, official statistics actually conceal as much as they reveal\n\nabout the behavior of different Latino groups. \n\n  There is reason to suspect that as much difference exists between\n\nCubans or Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans as between whites and blacks in\n\nrates of marriage and marital stability.29\n Still, such as it is, the evidence on Hispanic subgroups reveals\n\nsimilar trends to those described for blacks and whites in the United States.\n In sum, virtually all population subgroups have experienced a\n\npostponement of marriage, a steady increase in divorce, and a decrease in\n\nremarriage after divorce.\n Cohabitation as a prelude, aftermath, and perhaps alternative to\n\nmarriage has become more common.\n These patterns are more evident among African Americans.\n The declining institution of marriage has important ramifications for\n\npatterns of childbearing.\n Typically, now, marriage no longer regulates the timing of sex, and\n\nto an increasing degree, it no longer regulates the timing of first birth.30\n Nonmarital childbearing has become more prominent over the past\n\nseveral decades as rates of marital childbearing have declined and rates of\n\nnonmarital childbearing have held steady or increased.\n In 1960, only 5% of all births occurred to unmarried women; in 1990,\n\nthis proportion had risen to 28%.31\n The increase for whites has been tenfold, from 2% to 20% in this\n\n30-year period.\n\n  Figure 1 depicts the remarkable rise in the number of first\n\nbirths among women between the ages of 15 and 34 which have occurred before\n\nmarriage for whites, blacks, and Hispanics.\n Among each of the racial/ethnic subgroups, the increase has been\n\nremarkable over the past 30 years.\n For whites this number rose from 8.5% for births occurring in the\n\nearly 1960s to 21.6% for those that took place in the late 1980s.\n The rise for blacks was even more spectacular, going from 42.4% in\n\nthe early 1960s to 70.3% in the late 1980s.\n The proportion for Hispanics doubled during the same period, going\n\nfrom 19.2% to 37.5%.\n Clearly, out-of-wedlock childbearing has become a far more important\n\nsource of single parenthood for all Americans and especially so for African\n\nAmericans, who now have a sizable majority of first births before marriage.18\n\n( See Figure 1.)\n The weakening of marriage as a social institution is not unique to\n\nthe United States.\n Most developed countries are witnessing similar demographic trends.32\n In some instances, the retreat from marriage is even more pronounced.\n For example, in Scandinavia cohabitation has become a widely accepted\n\nalternative to marriage.33\n France and England have higher proportions of out-of-wedlock births\n\nthan occur in the United States, though a higher proportion of these births\n\noccur to parents who are cohabiting than in this country.34\n Divorce rates have also risen sharply in a number of European\n\nnations, though none equals this country in the prevalence of divorce.\n Still, about a third of marriages in Northern Europe will end in\n\ndivorce; in England and Scandinavia, as many as two in five marriages may\n\ndissolve.35\n Thus, explanations for the de-institutionalization of marriage cannot\n\nreside solely in the special features of American culture or society.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL",

{"text": "In the above discussion I have occasionally alluded to reasons why\n\naestheticians find supervenience an appealing notion.\n Now I should like to show in more detail how it has figured in three\n\npapers specifically dealing with aesthetic supervenience.\n\n Philip Pettit titles his paper  \u001c The Possibility of Aesthetic\n\nRealism,\"12 thereby making it clear that the  \u001c work\u001d  he\n\nwants to do is to provide a basis for proving or rationally justifying\n\naesthetic attributions.\n He begins by making three observations about aesthetic attributions, (\n\nhe uses the term  \" aesthetic characterization\").\n First he claims that they are not the same as pictorial attributions,\n\ne.g., color descriptions.\n ( I have always been puzzled by the fact that many theorists assume\n\nthat color statements are not aesthetic.\n I find it quite normal for people to report preferences for and\n\nappreciation of certain colors.\n \" I like that shade of green that permeates the world the first few\n\nweeks of spring,\u001d  seems perfectly aesthetic to me.\n But\n\nperhaps Pettit and others, would deny that these are, strictly speaking, \n\ndescriptions  .\n In any case, if this observation is not to be question-begging, it\n\nneeds more discussion.\n ( I will have more to say on this later.)\n\n\n\u001crelatively primitive,\u001d that is,  \u001cif a characterization\n\napplies to one work, then it applies to any which, subject to rectification\n\nfor colours, is observationally indistinguishable from that work; there is no\n\npossibility of an unobservable difference affecting how the works are\n\nrespectively characterised.\"13\n \u001csubject to rectification for\n\ncolours\u001d implies here.\n Does Pettit believe that colors can vary without aesthetic properties\n\nchanging\u001dIf so, I think he needs to provide some examples to show that\n\nthis is so.\n On the face of it, one would think that color-alterations would\n\naffect enormous changes.\n)\n Third, aesthetic attributions, according to Pettit, supervene on\n\npictorial characteristics.\n \" The indiscernibility of any two works with respect to their\n\npictorial characterisations entails their aesthetic indiscernibility;\n\nequivalently, there cannot be an aesthetic difference between two works\n\nunless there is also a pictorial one.\"14\n I shall later argue that this last claim is false, or at best trivial\n\nor misleading.\n\n  Pettit goes on to show that there is a version of aesthetic\n\nrealism consistent with these three observations.\n As on Blackburn 's analysis, supervenience, coupled with\n\nnon-entailment, creates a problem for the aesthetic realist.\n Pettit, assuming that aesthetic properties supervene on non-aesthetic\n\nones, must fiddle around with  entailment  .\n\n\n\u001cquasi-assertive\u001d nature of aesthetic statements ( in Crispin\n\nWright 's sense where evidence presented cannot fail to command agreement\n\nunless the statement is misunderstood) disappears when one fully understands\n\nthe role of perception in aesthetic attributions.15\n But such tinkering would perhaps not be necessary if the machinery of\n\nsupervenience were not considered a necessary tool for doing the work at\n\nhand.\n\n In  \u001cAesthetic Supervenience,\u001d Jerrold Levinson also\n\nassumes that aesthetic properties are supervenient.\n His goal is to explain the particular form that this supervenience\n\ntakes, and he opts for this:  \u001c(AS): Two objects ( e.g., art-works)\n\nthat differ  aesthetically  necessarily differ \n\nnon-aesthetically  .\"16\n That is, there could not be two objects that were aesthetically\n\ndifferent yet non-aesthetically identical-fixing the non-aesthetic properties\n\nof an object fixes its aesthetic properties.\n Levinson then posits three kinds of non-aesthetic properties as the\n\nbases upon which aesthetic ones supervene: perceivable, non-perceivable, and\n\ncontextual.\n He couples supervenience with emergence ( instead of reductionism or\n\ncondition-governed-ness)\n In order to provide a foundation for proving or rationally justifying\n\nthe attribution of the aesthetic properties that seem to him so ontologically\n\ndifferent from the non-aesthetic ones that one refers to in these proofs and\n\njustifications.\n\n Justification - - getting from non-aesthetic to aesthetic properties in\n\nthe absence of laws-- is John Bender 's main concern in  \u001cSupervenience\n\nand the Justification of Aesthetic Judgments.\u001d\n He increases the number of observations from Pettit 's three to six--\n\ndescribing them as  \u001ccommon fare for aestheticians.\"17\n They probably are common fare, and this is one reason that aesthetics\n\nis often so muddled, I think.\n\n The first  \u001ccommonplace\u001d is that   \u001cartworks and\n\nother aesthetic objects have both descriptive, structural, perceivable\n\nproperties, such as certain lines, colors, notes, sentences, chemical\n\nproperties, etc., and aesthetic properties, such as balance, unity,\n\ntranquillity, poise, charm, coherence, energy, grandness of design, etc.\n Pretty clearly, when conceived as universals, aesthetic properties\n\nare not identical to non-aesthetic ones.\"18 I do not accept this\n\na priori distinction.\n As I suggested above, I think color, for instance, may be an\n\naesthetic property.\n \u001cgrandness of\n\ndesign\u001d is certainly fuzzy, I believe.\n at the end of the lists of both aesthetic\n\nand non-aesthetic properties Bender provides is typical of aesthetic writing.\n The assumption is that all readers know exactly how to go on-- but\n\nI, for one, do not.\n\n Bender 's next two claims do seem correct to me.\n\n#2. Two objects with different non-aesthetic properties can be described by\n\nthe same aesthetic term.\n Both wine and music can be balanced, for example.\n\n#3.  \" There are, at least in general, no logical equivalences between\n\naesthetic and nonaesthetic predications.\u001d\n I also grant\n#6.\n most forceful\n\nstrategy for justifying aesthetic judgments ...\n is to cite those nonaesthetic properties of the thing which one\n\nbelieves are responsible for or result in the work 's having the property one\n\nhas claimed for it.\"  19\n\n  I disagree strongly, however, with commonplaces\n#4--  \u001cShort of imagining vast and general alterations in human\n\nsensibilities, in order to change the aesthetic properties of any work it is\n\nnecessary to change at least some of the nonaesthetic properties of that\n\nwork\u001d - - and\n#5--  \u001cNecessarily, if two artworks were to have precisely the same\n\nphysical and sensory properties, they would have the same aesthetic\n\nproperties.\"20\n It is because I deny both of these that I am dubious about\n\nsupervenience 's doing much aesthetic work, for Bender, correctly, believes\n\nthat together they provide an imprecise, but nevertheless close, statement of\n\naesthetic supervenience.\n I believe that aesthetic attributions are culture-bound.\n\n\n\u001csensibly\" from me to grant that he or she may apply different, even\n\ncontradictory aesthetic terms to the same object or event.\n Even I myself may, staying sensibly the same, come to apply\n\ndifferent or contradictory terms myself to an object whose non-aesthetic\n\nproperties are stable.\n\n\n  Using the notions of supervenience developed by Kim and\n\nBlackburn, Bender goes on to develop a more precise statement of aesthetic\n\nsupervenience.\n He includes in the set of base properties not only particular\n\nnon-aesthetic properties, but also their complements, for it is not only the\n\nproperties something actually possesses that matter For example, the elegance\n\nof Brancusi 's  The Bird  does not just depend upon polished surface,\n\ntapering curves, and seamlessness.\n It also depends upon the fact that certain properties are missing,\n\ne.g., being splashed with blood.\n Bender acknowledges that such an interpretation of supervenience\n\ngoes well beyond the properties usually or actually cited in justification,\n\nthat one must limit oneself to the  relevant  absent properties, and\n\nthat it is difficult to specify how to do this.\n Bender believes, however, that supervenience is necessary for the\n\nobjectivity of aesthetic attribution, and so is willing to tinker with it\n\nuntil he has a version of it that seems to work.\n think that supervenience is required, and so\n\nbelieve this whole messy and difficult ( and ultimately, I suspect,\n\nimpossible) task can be avoided.\n\n\n  Many of the distinctions listed in my opening paragraph do not\n\nhelp one do the aesthetic work we want to do because they do not hold up or,\n\neven if they do, they fail ultimately to tell us anything special about\n\naesthetic properties.\n Supervenience, I shall now argue, does not help because the\n\ndistinctions it depends upon do not hold up.21\n\n  Like reductionism or emergence, where one kind of property can\n\nhe defined in terms of, or comes forth from, another kind of property,\n\nsupervenience presupposes the existence of ( and usually ontological priority\n\nof) some  base set  of properties.\n\n\n\u001cNecessarily if x is F and G* ( a set of facts) underlies F then anything\n\nelse in state G* is also F.\"22\n\n\nIn other writers the base consists of a set of  \u001cnatural\u001d or\n\n \u001cstructural\u001d or physical\u001d or \" descriptive\u001d\n\nproperties.\n Aestheticians have used all of these terms, but usually simply think\n\nin terms of the base as  \u001cnon-aesthetic.\u001d So Blackburn 's\n\nversion becomes,  \u001cNecessarily if a is A and N underlies A, then\n\nanything else that is N is also A.\u001d\n But even Blackburn acknowledges a general problem with\n\nsupervenience.  \n \" Of course, G* can contain all kinds of relational truths about the\n\nsubject, truth about other things, and so on.\n In fact, one of the difficulties about thinking about all of this\n\nproperly is that it rapidly becomes unclear just what can be allowed in our\n\nconception of the totality of 6* states.\"   23\n Is the century in which an object is produced part of G* or N?\n If so, the apparent supervenience of properties like being realistic,\n\nexciting, graceful, or even beautiful begins to come into question.\n\n\n  Statements of supervenience that do not explicitly mention two\n\nontologically different sets ( these tend to be early, non-formal\n\narticulations)nonetheless typically provide a  \u001ctest\u001d that\n\nsupposedly enables one to make a distinction.\n\n\n  TEST: If one can imagine two objects or events identical in all\n\nrespects except that one has property P and the other does not have property\n\nP, then P is not supervenient; if one cannot imagine two objects or events\n\nidentical in all respects except that one has property P and the other does\n\nnot have property P, then P is supervenient.\n\n \n\n\u001cCan-you-can't-you\u001d game.\n \u001cI\n\ncan't\u001d marked off evaluative ( aesthetic and ethical) properties.\n Recently, as we have seen, they have been forced to admit that\n\n \u001cI can't\u001d does not provide an identifying mark of the\n\nevaluative, but accounts for a variety of  \" mysterious\u001d\n\nconnections.\n\n  Let us play a simple version of the game.\n Imagine two coffee mugs exactly alike in all respects except one.\n Which properties can one do this with, and which can't one do this\n\nwith\u001d\n\n\u001c and  \u001c CAN'TS  \u001c:\n\n  owned by Queen Elizabeth II yellow holding coffee\n\nnow</#>\n\n  delicate holds twelve ounces shaped like a\n\nduck\n\n \n\n\u001cmysterious\u001d relation that seems to exist between some properties\n\nassume that everyone 's intuitions will match and that they will thus be able\n\nto play this game without hesitation or doubt.\n But I find myself very quickly in a quandary.\nOn the one hand it\n\nseems a  can  - - for one might at first think it possible to\n\nimagine two coffee mugs of the same capacity, color, material, height, one\n\ncylindrical, the other cubical.\n But wait: if the mugs have the same capacity then they must either\n\nhave different heights or different base widths.\n .\n can't\n\n .\n on the above list ( owned by Elizabeth II, etc.)\n\ndo seem right to me, but the  can'ts  begin to waver.\n\n\n, but if it is a visual property, I  can  easily imagine two mugs\n\nidentical in all respects except that one is delicate according to Dick but\n\nnot according to Jane.\n Suppose the mugs are lead-based ceramic.\n Given different constitutions and susceptibilities, as Dick and Jane\n\ndrink out of the mugs identical in all respects, Dick might find his mug\n\npoisonous, Jane might find hers nonpoisonous.\n\n  Being poisonous, of course, like being to the left of or shorter\n\nthan, is a relative predicate ( not in the sense of being non-cognitive, but\n\nin the sense of requiring two names or descriptions to fill out the\n\npredicate).\n So are many aesthetic properties, and thus supervenience fails to\n\nhelp explain anything special about aesthetic proof or rational\n\njustification.\n Just as we saw that it is not clear what counts as F(A) and what\n\ncounts as G*(N), it is not clear how one is to interpret  \u001cin all\n\nrespects\u001d in the test.\n\n\n\u001crelational truths\"\u001cThe intuition behind supervenience is that when all\n\nbase properties remain stable, the supervening properties must remain stable.\n All aesthetic attributions must remain stable if the underlying\n\nnon-aesthetic attributions remain stable.\n\n\nor  \u001cseen by Jane,\u001d for instance) are included in the base,\n\nthe test for supervenience

{"text": "Warning: Recent changes in the retirement earnings test have\n\naffected this publication.\n We are revising it to reflect the provisions of the new law.\n In the meantime, to see how these changes may affect you, click here.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The loss of the family wage earner can be devastating to the\n\nsurvivors.\n This is an explanation of the benefits Social Security can provide for\n\nthe family.\n\n\n  If you are working, the first part tells you what kind of\n\nsurvivors benefits your tax dollars are paying for and how those benefits are\n\nearned. \n\n  If someone in your family has died, the second part explains how\n\nto sign up for Social Security benefits and what you need to know after\n\nbenefits start.\n\n\n  Please Note: This booklet provides a general overview of Social\n\nSecurity survivors benefits.\n The information it contains is not intended to cover all provisions\n\nof the law.\n For specific information about your case, contact Social\n\nSecurity.\n\n  Many people think of Social Security as a retirement program.\n But, retirement benefits are just one part of the Social Security\n\nprogram.\n\n  Some of the Social Security taxes you pay go toward survivors\n\ninsurance.\n In fact, the value of the survivors insurance you have under Social\n\nSecurity is probably more than the value of your individual life\n\ninsurance.\n\n  When someone who has worked and paid into Social Security dies,\n\nsurvivor benefits can be paid to certain family members.\n These include widows, widowers ( and divorced widows and widowers),\n\nchildren, and dependent parents.\n\n  You, along with millions of other people, earn survivors\n\ninsurance by working and paying Social Security taxes.\n Right now, 98 out of every 100 children could get benefits if a\n\nworking parent should die.\n In fact, Social Security pays more benefits to children than any\n\nother federal program.\n\n\n  When you die, certain members of your family may be eligible for\n\nsurvivors benefits if you worked, paid Social Security taxes and earned\n\nenough \" credits.\" You can earn a maximum of four credits each year.\n The number of credits you need depends on your age when you die.\n The younger a person is, the fewer credits he or she needs to have\n\nfamily members be eligible for survivors benefits.\n But nobody needs more than 40 credits ( 10 years of work) to be\n\neligible for any Social Security benefits.\n\n  Under a special rule, benefits can be paid to your children and\n\nyour spouse who is caring for the children, even though you don't have the\n\nnumber of credits needed.\n They can get benefits if you have credit for one and one half years\n\nof work in the three years just before your death.\n\n  There is a special one-time payment of\n\n&dollar;255 that can be made when you die if you have enough work \" credits.\" This\n\npayment can be made only to your spouse or minor children if they meet\n\ncertain requirements.\n\n\n  If you've been divorced, your f 'veer wife or husband can get\n\nbenefits under the same circumstances as your widow or widower if your\n\nmarriage lasted 10 years or more.\n Your former spouse, however, does not have to meet the\n\nlength-of-marriage rule if she or he is caring for your child who is under 16\n\nor disabled and who is also getting benefits on your Social Security record.\n The child must be your former spouse 's natural or legally adopted\n\nchild.\n\n  Benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse who is age 60 or\n\nolder ( 50-60 if disabled) will not affect the benefit rates for other\n\nsurvivors getting benefits.\n\n\n  How much your family can get from Social Security depends on your\n\naverage lifetime earnings.\n That means the higher your earnings, the higher their benefits will\n\nbe.\n\n  If you would like to get an estimate of the Social Security\n\nsurvivors benefits that could be paid to your family, call or visit us to ask\n\nfor a Form SSA-7004 ( Request for Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate\n\nStatement.) \n\n  Within four to six weeks after you complete and return the form\n\nto us, you will receive a statement showing an estimate of survivors benefits\n\nthat could be paid, as well as an estimate of retirement and disability\n\nbenefits and other important information.\n There 's no charge for this service.\n\n Part 2-If A Loved One Has Died ... What You Need To Know About\n\nSurvivors Benefits \n\n\n  How you sign up for survivors benefits depends on whether or not\n\nyou're getting other 'recial Security benefits.\n\n\n  You should apply for survivors benefits promptly because, in some\n\ncases, benefits may not be retroactive.\n\n\n  We need certain information to process your application.\n It 's helpful if you have it when you apply.\n But don't delay applying if you don't have everything.\n We will help you get it.\n We need either original documents or copies certified by the agency\n\nthat issued them.\n\n\n  If you're getting bene 'res as a wife or husband on your spouse 's\n\nrecord when he or she dies, you should report the death to us and we will\n\nchange your payments to survivors benefits.\n\n\n  If you're getting be 'reits on your own record, you'll need t 'll\ncomplete an application to get survivors benefits.\n Call or visit us and we'll check 'llsee if you can get more money as\n\na widow or widower.\n We'll need t 'llee your spouse 's death certificate to process your\n\nclaim.\n\n  Benefits for any children will automatically be changed to\n\nsurvivors benefits after the death is reported to us.\n\n\n\n  The amount of your benefit is based on the earnings of the person\n\nwho died.\n The more he or she paid into Social Security, the higher your\n\nbenefits will be.\n\n  The amount you will get is a percentage of the deceased 's basic\n\nSocial Security benefit.\n The percentage depends on your age and the type of benefit you are\n\neligible for. \n\n\n  There is a limit to the amount of money that can be paid to you\n\nand other family members each month.\n The limit varies, but is generally equal to about 150 to 180 percent\n\nof the deceased 's benefit rate.\n If the sum of the benefits payable to the family members is greater\n\nthan this limit, the benefits will be reduced proportionately.\n\n\n  If you are receiving widows or widowers ( including divorced\n\nwidows or widowers) benefits, you should remember that you can switch to your\n\nown retirement benefit as early as age 62.\n This assumes you're eli 'rele and your retirement rate is higher than\n\nyour widow'(er) rate.\n In many cases, a widow(er) can begin receiving one benefit at a\n\nreduced rate and then switch to the other benefit at an unreduced rate at age\n\n65.\n The rules are complicated and vary depending on your situation, so\n\nyou should talk to a one of our representatives about the options available\n\nto you.\n\n\n  If you get Social Security survivors benefits, the amount of your\n\nbenefits may be reduced if your earnings exceed certain limits.\n To find out what the limits are this year and how earnings above\n\nthose limits reduce your social Security benefits, contact us to request the\n\nleaflet, How Work Affects Your Benefits ( Publication No. 05-10069).\n\n\n  Your earnings will reduce only your survivors benefits, not the\n\nbenefits of other family members.\n\n\n  Generally, you can't get survivors benefits if you remarry.\n But, remarriage after age 60 ( 50 if disabled) will not prevent\n\nbenefit payments on your former spouse 's record.\n And, at age 62 or older, you may get benefits on the record of your\n\nnew spouse if they are higher.\n\n\n  Medicare is a health insurance plan for people who are age 65 or\n\nolder.\n People who are disabled or have kidney failure also can get\n\nMedicare.\n\n  Medicare has two parts-hospital insurance and medical insurance.\n\n\n  Hospital insurance, sometimes called Part A, covers inpatient\n\nhospital care and certain follow-up care.\n The worker already paid for it as part of his or her Social Security\n\ntaxes while he or she was working.\n\n  Medical insurance, sometimes called Part B, pays for physicians'\n\nservices and some other services not covered by hospital insurance.\n\n\n  Some people are already getting Social Security benefits when\n\nthey turn 65, and their Medicare starts automatically.\n Others must file an application.\n For more information, call the Health Care Financing Administration\n\nat 1-800 MEDICAR(E) and ask for a copy of the handbook, \" Medicare and You\".\n\n\n\n \n\n  If you get Medicare and have low income and few resources, your\n\nstate may pay your Medicare premiums and, in some cases, other \"\n\nout-of-pocket\" Medicare expenses such as deductibles and coinsurance.\n Only your state can decide if you qualify.\n To find out if you do, contact your local welfare office or Medicaid\n\nagency.\n For more information about the program, contact Social Security and\n\nask for a copy of the publication Medicare Savings For Qualified\n\nBeneficiaries ( HCFA Publication No. 02184).\n\n\n  We keep personal information on millions of people.\n That information-such as your Social Security number, earnings\n\nrecord, age, and address-is personal and confidential.\n Generally, we will discuss this information only with you.\n We need your permission if you want someone else to help with your\n\nSocial Security business.\n\n  If you ask friends or family members to call us, you need to be\n\nwith them when they call so we will know that you want them to help.\n Our representative will ask your permission to discuss your Social\n\nSecurity business with that person.\n\n  If you send a friend or family member to our local office to\n\nconduct your Social Security business, send your written consent with them.\n Only with your written permission can SSA discuss your personal\n\ninformation with them and provide the answers to your questions.\n\n  In the case of a minor child, the natural parent or legal\n\nguardian can act on the child 's behalf in taking care of the child 's Social\n\nSecurity business.\n\n  The privacy of your records is guaranteed.\n There are times when the law requires Social Security to give\n\ninformation to other government agencies to conduct other government health\n\nor welfare programs such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Medicaid,\n\nand food stamps.\n Programs receiving information from Social Security are prohibited\n\nfrom sharing that information.\n\n\n  Recorded information and services are available 24 hours a day,\n\nincluding weekends and holidays by calling Social Security 's

{"text": "Aside from announcements, the main item must be deciding on\n\npriorities for line requests for 97\u001e98, which are due at the Dean 's Office by\n\nSeptember 18.\n I would like the Executive Committee to have a recommendation to put\n\nbefore the department; the relevant guidelines and constraints are as\n\nfollows:\n\n  1) Every position request, even for a line vacated by death or\n\nretirement, must be fully justified, even though the Academic Program Review\n\ndetermined that our department should be maintained at its current strength.\n\n  2) Programmatic integrity will be only one of several criteria\n\nused in determining which units will be permitted to recruit.\n\n  3) Enrollments will be a factor in awarding lines.\n This means both actual numbers and potential numbers.\n Any proposed line likely to increase enrollments will be viewed\n\nfavorably.\n\n  4) Affirmative action is a high priority this year.\n Lines will go to those depts. that can demonstrate that there is a\n\npool of candidates of color for the position being recruited.\n\n  5) Positions that will strengthen general education also remain\n\ndesirable.\n\n  6) The possibility of joint appointments should be explored; a\n\ndepartment increases the possibility of getting more than one line if one of\n\nthe requests is for a person who would contribute a percentage of teaching\n\nand service to one of the collegiate programs or intercollegiate divisions.\n\n  All this being so, we should consider, in addition to the obvious\n\nneed for an American literature specialist to replace  Gia Lannone,\n\nhow to weigh our FY 96 requests for an African\u001eAmericanist and a professional\n\nwriting position and the FY 95 request for a specialist in pedagogy.\n We might also give some thought to how we could design a line that we\n\nshare with, for instance, the new Communications Division.\n Possibilities: a specialist in media studies, media production,\n\nand/or telecommunications; a professional writer/journalist; a visiting\n\nprofessional writer/creative writer\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Back in September I promised to schedule a second meeting of\n\npart\u001etime faculty before the term was over, preferably in November.\n At the time I hadn't fully grasped what kind of pace I would have to\n\nmarch at during the fall semester\u001e\u001eand so I am already very late.\n I expect that many of you are also tired at this point in the\n\nsemester and are trying to hold on until the last day of classes.\n\n\n  notice has already gone out about an informal holiday party on\n\nthe afternoon of Friday, December 13, following a department meeting at noon.\n What if we had a gathering of as many of you as wanted to meet over\n\ncoffee and doughnuts at 10 A.M. on the 13th?\n Then you could stay on if you like for the department meeting and/or\n\nthe party.\n\n  As always, this proposed meeting is purely voluntary; you are\n\nunder no obligation to come, and you are most welcome to skip the meeting and\n\nstill come to the party in the afternoon.\n\n  I'd apprec 'dte it if you would leave a note in my mailbox if you\n\nwant to have this meeting\u001e\u001eand you might add what topics you would want to\n\nsee on the agenda.\n If at least eight of you want to meet I'll book a 'llace, send out a\n\nconfirmation note, and we'll go ahe 'lland gather at 10 o'clock on the\n\n13th.\n\n\n \n\n  It appears that there is enough interest to warrant scheduling an\n\nend\u001eof\u001eterm meeting on Friday, December 13, from 10:00\u001e11:45 AM.\n I have reserved the Music Department Lounge, room W\u001e6\u001e94.\n\n\n  I have one suggested agenda item: Creative writing opportunities\n\nfor ESL students who have completed the 101E\u001e102E sequence;  Bruce\n\nJoyce will speak to this issue. \n\n  Please let me know of any other topics for discussion that you\n\nwant on the table.\n\n\n  Reminder: holiday party starting shortly after 2 o'clock that\n\nafternoon.\n\n  The main task of the committee for this year is to undertake a\n\ncomprehensive review of the department 's curriculum for majors, leading to a\n\nset of recommendations for a revision of the curriculum and the requirements\n\nfor the B.A. in English. \n\n  The work of the committee may be enhanced and supported if the\n\ndepartment receives a grant from the ACE\u001eKellogg funds available for\n\nassessment work on the campus [ see attached proposal], but with or without\n\nthe grant the following tasks need to be accomplished:\n\n  1) Research into how other departments have redesigned their\n\nEnglish majors in recent years.\n This research should probably pay particular attention to any of our\n\npeer institutions whose English departments have revised their majors [ e.g.,\n\nGeorge Mason, University of Illinois\u001eChicago, University of\n\nMaryland\u001eBaltimore, etc.], but need not be limited to our peer institutions.\n [ For starters, see packet on the new English curriculum at Millsaps\n\nCollege.]\n The committee should aim to gather the materials for this research by\n\nthe end of the fall semester.\n\n  2) Study of the planning for the new university general education\n\nprogram to ensure that planning and sequencing of major requirements is\n\nsynchronized with general education developments on the campus.\n Curriculum committee members should read the April 1996 report of the\n\nGeneral Education Steering Committee and the new report of that committee\n\nwhich is scheduled to be submitted for review by the Faculty Council in\n\nNovember 1996.\n\n  3) Assessment of strengths and limitations of the current English\n\nmajor program, including sophomore requirements and advanced requirements and\n\nelectives; scheduling patterns of courses; kinds of courses or requirements\n\nmissing from the curriculum; means for ensuring quality control of the major\n\nprogram and for measuring student accomplishment in the program.\n The committee should aim to make a preliminary report of its findings\n\nto the department at the March 1997 department meeting; the committee may\n\nalso want to propose at this meeting a mechanism for ongoing consultation\n\nwith and involvement by the department in the process of reshaping the\n\ncurriculum.\n\n  4) After discussion with the department, the Curriculum Committee\n\nshould concentrate on developing its recommendations for changes to the\n\nEnglish major curriculum.\n A final report and recommendations on the major should be presented\n\nto the department for its consideration by the end of the Fall 1997\n\nsemester.\n\n\n\n  As I promised a few days ago, I brought to the department meeting\n\nof December 13 your offer of a one\u001ethird share of the line that has been\n\nawarded to the Africana Studies Department for a position in African\u001eAmerican\n\nliterature.\n The department has instructed me to accept this offer, although with\n\na deep sense of dismay and disappointment that the teaching needs of the\n\ndepartment and our obligations to our students, as detailed in our requests\n\nfor our own tenure\u001etrack appointments, are not being addressed.\n\n  In accepting the share of the line with Africana Studies I'd like\n\n'd\nto specify several understandings for the future:\n\n  1) You and I both agree that this offer does not satisfy the\n\ndepartment 's need for faculty in American literature, African\u001eAmerican\n\nliterature, and other minority literatures, and that the acceptance of this\n\noffer by our department should not be understood as undercutting or\n\nprejudicing the department 's resubmission of requests for those positions\n\nnext year.\n\n  2) Although you have expressed the hope that the candidate\n\neventually hired by Africana Studies might have pedagogical expertise that\n\ncould be helpful in the preparation or supervision of English education\n\nmajors, you and I both agree that this one\u001ethird position can not satisfy the\n\ndepartment 's urgent need for additional full\u001etime support for its majors\n\npreparing to teach in the schools.\n\n  3) The English department shall be represented by two members on\n\nthe search committee for the candidate; shall conduct annual reviews of the\n\nteaching done by the appointee in English department courses and have a voice\n\nin decisions about reappointment; and shall have a substantive role in\n\nfourth\u001eyear and tenure reviews of the appointee.\n\n  4) Because the department remains understaffed in American\n\nliterature after the deaths of  Jay Trib and  Ed Man, we will\n\nbe seeking temporary lines, full\u001etime or part\u001etime, in 1997\u001e98 to ensure the\n\nadequacy of our offerings in the American literature program.\n\n  Finally, I must convey my own sense of frustration, shared by\n\nmany others in the department, on two scores.\n The inability of the College to offer us even the minimal number of\n\nlines called for by the Academic Program Review raises real questions whether\n\nprogram reviews offer meaningful or reliable assurances to departments about\n\ntheir capacity to carry out their missions.\n Once again, there will be increased cynicism within the faculty\n\ncommunity that program reviews serve only managerial interests rather than\n\nthe interests of academic programs or students.\n And even more importantly, I feel frustrated at the department 's\n\nbeing prevented from recruiting more minority faculty.\n The provost 's committee on minority faculty has dispatched frequent\n\nmessages about the university 's commitment to minority recruitment.\n My department was fully prepared to heed that call and was confident\n\nthat we could identify excellent minority candidates for several of the lines\n\nwe requested.\n It is discouraging that we have not been permitted to make this\n\neffort.\n\n\n\n\n  1. The Executive Committee and I have discussed using a portion [\n\nthe amount as yet undetermined] of the department 's allocation from the\n\nuniversity 's annual fund to proceed with the renovation of the Department\n\nLounge and the construction of the Gittleman Library.\n In order to ensure that anyone in the department with an interest in\n\nthe future uses and appearance of the lounge has a chance to help make the\n\ndecisions about this common space, the Executive Committee has authorized a\n\nredecorating committee.\n Membership is open to any member of the departmental faculty or staff\n\nwho wishes to join.\n will chair the committee; please let Janet know if\n\nyou would like to join.\n Since we expect some of the renovation work to be initiated sometime\n\nin the spring semester, some important decisions about planning should be\n\nmade soon.\n\n  Several memos on the Urban Mission Action Plan, dated October\n\n1996, from colleagues are in general circulation and other materials have\n\nbeen sent to members of the ad hoc committee.\n These memos will help frame the discussion, but all members of the\n\ndepartment may want to read the Urban Mission Action Plan before the December\n\n13 meeting.\n\n  3. Following the department meeting, we will have an informal\n\nholiday celebration.\n I would ask for volunteers to supply simple pot\u001eluck appetizers and\n\nsnacks; the department budget will take care of beverages for the occasion.\n If you are able to contribute something to the buffet of appetizers,\n\nplease tear off the bottom of this sheet and leave it in my mailbox.\n\n\n  Film requests for the Spring semester should be submitted in the\n\nsecond week of December ( Dec. 9\u001e13) to  Sven Luda in the Film\n\nServices office in Healey Library.\n Because of reduced funds this year it is important to make timely\n\nsubmissions of requests.\n Film request forms will be available in the department office.\n We also have an up\u001eto\u001edate catalog of films and videos owned by the\n\nuniversity.\n directly at\n\nextension 7\u001e5961. \n\n\n  1. Department Meeting, Friday, December 13 at noon.\n To be followed, at approximately 2 o'clock, by a holiday celebration\n\nwith drinks and appetizers.\n We have a few commitments for appetizers; if you are thinking you\n\nmight be hungry on Friday, please volunteer to bring some food.\n\n  2. Change in eligibility for the Peter Brooks Butler Scholarship\n\nto Oxford.\n Requirements used to state that this scholarship for tuition and air\n\nfare for the summer program at Oxford was not open to seniors.\n Please let students in your courses know that applications are open\n\nto any English major with an interest in Renaissance literature or creative\n\nwriting who will not yet have graduated by the end of August 1997.\n\n\n\n  I want to report on how our financial picture looks at the\n\nmoment, and I invite you to give me or a member of the Executive\n\nCommitteeyour suggestions about departmental priorities for spending of our\n\ndiscretionary funds in II and III below.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "10e85b77-a35e-4c6a-a563-b15ca0c6a2a0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.666326+00:00"}
{"text": "IRAN - CONTRA INVESTIGATIONS - - WALSH CAN RETIRE TO LET HISTORY\n\nSORT OUT THE LIES\n\n  PUBLISHERS dangling six-figure advance payments have a better\n\nchance than independent counsel Lawrence Walsh of ferreting out the truth\n\nabout the Iran - contra coverup.\n\n  Walsh reported to Congress last week that he had key Reagan\n\nadministration officials prepared to testify that their colleagues lied about\n\nthe arms-for-hostage deals.\n\n  This close-but-no-cigar announcement is hardly a satisfactory\n\nconclusion for Walsh or the public.\n Walsh, a prominent Republican attorney, has spent years and perhaps\n\n&dollar; 30 million to crack the Iran - contra scandal.\n\n  His efforts suffered legal setbacks, but the final political blow\n\nwas President George Bush 's Christmas Eve pardon of Caspar Weinberger, the\n\nformer defense secretary.\n\n  The discovery of extensive notes by Weinberger had energized\n\nWalsh 's inquiry.\n He indicted Weinberger for lying to Congress, and not disclosing the\n\ncontents of the detailed journals.\n\n  Weinberger 's accounts of White House meetings directly challenge\n\nBush 's veracity.\n In Walsh 's report to Congress, he suggested that Bush pardoned\n\nWeinberger to spare himself a court appearance and a potentially damning\n\ncross-examination under oath.\n\n  Former Secretary of State George Shultz was on Walsh 's witness\n\nlist as well.\n A new book by Shultz takes Bush to task for what can only be\n\ndescribed in polite terms as a grievously faulty memory.\n\n  Walsh gave it his best shot, but he was hobbled from the\n\nbeginning by a clumsy congressional investigation.\n It 's ever more apparent he faced a determined cabal of liars who had\n\nthe unlimited resources of the executive branch at their disposal.\n\n  Still, Walsh 's venue is the courtroom, not the interview, talk\n\nshow or report to Congress.\n Weinberger added a critical dimension, and his extraordinary\n\npresidential pardon before a trial is held, let alone conviction, will have\n\nto speak for itself.\n\n  Walsh 's critics call for restraints on special prosecutors.\n Such a debate would be healthy.\n So would a review of presidential power to pardon.\n What was once a last resort when justice had failed, has devolved\n\ninto a political escape clause.\n\n  The truth behind the wretched Iran - contra tale will out over\n\ntime.\n Fat checks from publishers will loosen memories and inflame word\n\nprocessors.\n These liars may elude the law and enrich themselves, but there is no\n\nstatute of limitations on infamy.\n\n \n THE WEINBERGER PARDON - - DID BUSH CLOSE THE BOOK OR FEED\n\nNATION'S DOUBTS?\n\n  IT SEEMS strangely appropriate that one of President Bush 's last\n\nofficial acts was to issue blanket pardons of Caspar Weinberger and five\n\nco-defendants.\n By doing so he attempted to close the books on Iran - contra without\n\nresolving his own role in that dark chapter of American political\n\nhistory.\n\n  For Weinberger, the Christmas Eve release appears to be an act of\n\nholiday generosity toward a 75-year-old man with an ailing wife and a proud\n\nrecord of public service.\n Many Americans never understood the indictment and impending trial of\n\na former cabinet member known to have sternly opposed the ill-fated\n\narms-for-hostages deal.\n\n  And few Americans would complain if the pardons actually ended an\n\ninterminable investigation that has consumed six years and\n\n&dollar; 35 million - all while focusing on what a few people did or did not know\n\nwhen they testified before Congress.\n\n  Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh 's angry remarks following the\n\npardons played into the hands of his critics.\n Even prominent Democrats, including Speaker Tom Foley, preferred not\n\nto add to the political venom coming from both sides.\n\n  But if Walsh 's zeal amounts to an abuse of the special counsel 's\n\nmission, Bush 's pardons merely aggravate that abuse.\n\n  Bush 's contention that the indictments amounted to \" the\n\ncriminalization of policy differences\" is an outrageous misrepresentation of\n\nthe case.\n\n  Nobody, not even Walsh, accused Weinberger or any other Iran -\n\ncontra figure of disagreeing on policy.\n They were accused of lying to Congress - and, by extension, to the\n\nAmerican people.\n Such abuse of public trust is one reason the office of the\n\nindependent counsel was created in the first place.\n\n  Some will interpret Bush 's action as loyalty toward fellow public\n\nservants; others as a blatant attempt to duck responsibility for his own\n\nactions.\n\n  But the presidential pardons go far beyond holiday mercy, or even\n\npolitical cronyism.\n By extending his political generosity toward the people whose public\n\ntestimony could hurt him the most, he has provided Walsh with ammunition to\n\ncarry on his public attacks.\n\n  Bush has left the American public, and eventually historians, to\n\nponder the real motivation behind one of his last presidential acts.\n A FAILURE TO ACT BNL-IRAQI LOAN CASE CRIES FOR INDEPENDENT\n\nCOUNSEL\n\n  NO presidential administration wants to investigate itself, or\n\nsurrender control if forced to submit to scrutiny.\n\n  That hard lesson from Watergate resulted in passage of the\n\nIndependent Counsel Act in 1978.\n Congress failed to reauthorize the law this year, and the opportunity\n\nto appoint an independent counsel to ferret out the truth about U.S.-backed\n\nbank loans to Iraq expires on Tuesday.\n\n  Attorney General William Barr will eagerly embrace the\n\nrecommendation of a special prosecutor - his appointee - that no further\n\ninquiry is necessary.\n\n \n\n  The scandal focuses on the use of the Atlanta affiliate of the\n\nItalian Banca Nazionale del Lavoro ( BNL) to funnel\n\n&dollar; 5.5 billion in federally guaranteed loans to Iraq, and eventually to Saddam\n\nHussein 's secret weapons programs.\n\n  Justice Department officials have put all their emphasis on the\n\nprosecution of the Atlanta branch manager, despite intelligence information\n\nthat Italian officials knew of his activities.\n\n  The judge presiding over the Atlanta trial has been one of the\n\nJustice Department 's most pointed critics.\n Conservative columnist William Safire, a former Nixon speech writer,\n\nhas hammered away at the veracity and the probity of Barr and his deputies,\n\nand the related Bush policy of coddling Hussein.\n\n  Barr and the White House skittered away from the law with good\n\nreason, but Congress dropped the ball.\n\n  Buffeted by House banking and post office scandals, and Senate\n\nethics probes, congressional leadership was uncomfortable revising a law that\n\nmight come back to haunt them.\n\n  Election-year jitters were heightened by criticism of the long\n\nand expensive Iran - contra investigation by independent counsel Lawrence\n\nWalsh.\n\n  Walsh, who has suffered court reversals because of ham-fisted\n\ncongressional inquiries, also made enemies with rumors he might be after\n\nRonald Reagan.\n\n  Walsh has tried to crack a pervasive government coverup of the\n\nReagan-Bush scheme to trade U.S. weapons to Iran in exchange for release of\n\nAmerican hostages.\n A jury yesterday convicted a former CIA spy chief of lying to\n\nCongress about Iran - contra.\n\n  Walsh, the 11th independent counsel, could be the last, unless\n\nCongress revives the law in January.\n The arrival of a Democratic administration may find sudden GOP\n\ninterest, after feeling a Republican-controlled White House was unduly\n\nsingled out.\n\n  If time limits and financial accountability are needed, modify a\n\nnew independent counsel act to include them.\n The legality of this enterprise was endorsed by the Supreme Court in\n\n1987.\n\n  The BNL case begs for investigation.\n\n IRAN, IRAQ AND GEORGE BUSH - - FBI, CIA, JUSTICE DEPT. SNARED IN\n\nA WEB OF LIES\n\n  TWENTY years after a third-rate burglary at the Watergate\n\ncomplex, a first-rate bit of larceny and diplomatic double-dealing will be\n\ninvestigated by a special prosecutor.\n\n  Attorney General William Barr relented Friday under congressional\n\npressure and agreed to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Bush\n\nadministration 's handling of a case that involved billions in U.S.-backed\n\nloans to Saddam Hussein.\n\n  This scandal is so outrageous that a fight has broken out between\n\nthe Justice Department and the Central Intelligence Agency that leaps beyond\n\nwhether anyone lied or misled Congress and a federal judge.\n That 's a given; the question is who ordered the cover-up, and where\n\ndoes it start and end.\n\n  The case and the investigation involve such deep doodoo that when\n\nthe FBI was brought in to investigate the Justice Department, the\n\nadministration and the CIA, the FBI director and his spouse were suddenly\n\naccused of ethics violations.\n\n  The FBI was shoved on the defense as it began to focus on its\n\ndepartment patrons at Justice.\n\n  The stench wafting off this scandal is the mixed aroma of\n\ncorruption and fear.\n No one wants the truth to get out about the administration\n\nbankrolling a dictator; looks lousy on a resume.\n\n  As President Bush fends off blows about the burgeoning Iraqgate,\n\nhis truthfulness about his role and knowledge of the Iranian arms-for-hostage\n\ndeal is under fire.\n\n  Despite authoritative testimony and evidence to the contrary,\n\nBush has steadfastly denied he was aware that arms headed for the Ayatollah\n\nKhomeini 's revolutionaries were ransom for hostages.\n\n  This past week, Bush appeared to reverse course with a grand\n\nrevision during a morning television interview ostensibly with his wife,\n\nBarbara Bush.\n In answer to direct, repeated questions, the president suggested that\n\nwell, of course, he knew all along the arms were ransom.\n\n\n  For weeks George Bush has tried to make character and probity\n\nissues in the campaign.\n He is right.\n The American public is owed the truth about his role in two scandals\n\nthat refuse to go away.\n\n  He is haunted by ghosts that will not rest until the truth is\n\nout.\n Looking back, a special prosecutor had to be retained before the long\n\nnightmare of Watergate was over.\n IRAN - CONTRA SCANDAL - - CRACKING A WALL OF LIES WITH PATIENCE\n\nAND LUCK \n\n  THE indictment of former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger is\n\nthe final chapter of the Iran - contra scandal.\n\n  If government investigators are correct, the high-ranking Reagan\n\nofficial and his 1,700 pages of hand-written notes are a treasure trove of\n\ninside information about illegal arms sales to Iran.\n If this case collapses, the clamor to close down the five-year\n\ninvestigation will be too loud to ignore.\n\n  Weinberger is accused of lying to Congress and making false\n\nstatements to investigators for congressional panels and Special Prosecutor\n\nJohn Walsh.\n\n  According to the indictment, Weinberger concealed the existence\n\nof detailed diaries he kept of daily meetings and telephone calls.\n He gave the notebooks to the Library of Congress in 1987 on the\n\ncondition he controlled access to them.\n\n  The indictment challenges Weinberger 's carefully nurtured image\n\nas an outspoken opponent of... material.\n\n  Convictions of John Poindexter and Oliver North were overturned\n\nout of concern their testimony under a grant of immunity before Congress was\n\nused against them.\n\n  Two senior CIA officials were indicted last year and await trial.\n They, along with Weinberger, have no grants of... a solid walls of\n\nlies.\n\n\n  Usually feisty Republicans in Congress, especially those on the\n\nHouse Iran - contra committee, were curiously subdued following this latest\n\nindictment.\n They want to see how this unfolds; they get a whiff of having been\n\nplayed...\n U.S. TAXPAYERS GET THE BILL - - HOW BUSH POLICY HELPED IRAQ BUY,\n\nDEVELOP ARMS\n\n  ... misappropriation of\n\n&dollar; 750 million.\n\n  Early Reagan administration policy tilted toward Iraq after it\n\ninvaded U.S. nemesis Iran.\n Iraq was removed from the list of nations sponsoring state\n\nterrorism, and diplomatic relations were restored after a 17-year lapse.\n\n  As the Iran - Iraq war dragged on, heavily indebted Iraq had\n\ntrouble borrowing money.\n Twice as vice president, Bush personally... but the administration\n\nhas fought him at every turn.\n\n  The legal adviser to the National Security Council is refusing\n\nto turn over documents to Congress, arguing that oral summaries are\n\nsufficient.\n\n\n \n U.S. TAXPAYERS GET THE BILL - - HOW BUSH POLICY HELPED IRAQ BUY,\n\nDEVELOP ARMS\n\n  U.

It is part of our ornamental strategy to plant communities\n\nof plants.\n It is cheaper, looks better, and means less materials consumed.\n In communities plants are arranged in discrete patterns.\n This spatial planting occurs naturally, via pathogens and litter (\n\nmulch), allowing certain seedlings to grow, killing the weaker seedlings or\n\nseedlings that are out of the successional pattern, for the better of the\n\nwhole.\n This is how natural succession occurs.\n When a site is planted incorrectly, the system is weakened, becomes\n\nincreasingly unstable, and weeds, herbivores ( including gophers) take an\n\nenormous toll. \n\n  This won't occur if a design is implemented in a manner\n\nconsistent with nature.\n Plant for maturity ( leave enough space for the plant when it reaches\n\nits full size) with the stress-tolerant species and inter-plant with the\n\nCircumventer, C type species for fast fill in.\n C type species provide cover for the climax stress-tolerants and will\n\ndecline and die of 'old age' as the climax species fill-in.\n Some examples of some Circumventers: Salvias, Ceanothus, Lupinus,\n\nDiplacus, Baccharis, Eriogonum and even poppies do this very well. \n\n  By doing a natural planting, you can move to a native site\n\nfaster, lowering inputs sooner.\n It is important to get your species composition as close as\n\nreasonably possible to nature 's.\n Site specific plant material doesn't appear to be practical, nor\n\npossible for most sites.\n ( Las Pilitas personnel can do site specific biological surveys,\n\ndevelop the appropriate species list, and contract grow the plants.\n It will take 1-5 years according to the site.)\n Planting for the right soil, right community, shade in shade, sun in\n\nsun, wet to wet, etc. appears to be more than adequate for the stability of\n\nthe system and for the site 's wildlife.\n Again, if you live in Los Angeles you can plant species from\n\nChaparral, Southern Oak woodland, and Coastal Sage Scrub communities together\n\nand get away with it ( as long as the soils, water, sun, etc. match) as the\n\ncommunities were there before the ecosystem was screwed up.\n The plants would prefer to be in separate groupings, but that 's not\n\neven necessary.\n Plants from the yellow pine forest, Closed cone Pine Forest, etc.,\n\nwill grow there, but they are more unstable ( weedy, short-lived).\n It 's more important to plant Coastal Sage Scrub species together,\n\neven if from other areas of the state, ( the further away in climate, the\n\nmore unsuitable the plant) than mixing other communities that didn't\n\nhistorically exist in your locale.\n You will spend about 1/10th of the maintenance on the site over a\n\n5-10 year period if you get it right.\n The maintenance is equal for the first year but then drops off\n\ndramatically as the plant community takes hold.\n You 'll know you 'built a plant community' when the true wildlife\n\nstart living in your garden ( or restoration) and native seedlings start\n\nshowing up.\n Put the perennials together and the shrubs and trees together as\n\nthey have different needs than annuals.\n They should be clumped in a way as to be easily maintained.\n Annuals between are acceptable and encouraged in desert and\n\ngrassland plant communities.\n ( The weeds will drive you crazy if you do not move aggressively and\n\ncontinually against them.) \n\n  If you insist on planting ruderals, plant by age.\n The short-lived plants go together.\n Plant the long-lived plants together away from water, away from soil\n\ndisturbance.\n Do not mix annuals with groundcovers, they will become weedy.\n Annuals are only acceptable where you can mow them down after they\n\ndie.\n Otherwise they look like a relative you owe money, a lot of money.\n Berms are a sign the designer is lazy or doesn't know what to do.\n They are very hard to maintain, irrigate ( on berms you do have to\n\nirrigate), and keep the plants alive on.\n If the berm look is desired, put larger growing plants there, in the\n\ncenter, and work down to smaller ones.\n If the drainage of a berm is required, use retaining walls with good\n\ndrain holes so each level is uniform and within 2' of the beginning soil\n\nlevel on either top or bottom ( no more than 2' steps. \n\n  Please, please, pretty please do not put in a fake creek!\n Fake creeks are hard to build and very hard to maintain.\n The weeds usually overwhelm the creek in a year or so.\n A bunch of rocks and weeds does not increase the selling price of a\n\nhouse, nor does an old truck with flowers planted in it, they look similar.\n A decomposed granite path with boulders, logs and plants can usually\n\ncreate the same feeling with a whole lot less work.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0e5f857b-f374-4940-84a4-6bc26da53d41", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.669287+00:00"}
{"text": "IDEOLOGY AND GENRE IN THE BRITISH ANTIREVOLUTIONARY DRAMA OF THE\n\n1790s\n\n\n \n\nBastille  ( Royal Circus, 1789), John St. John 's  Island of St.\n\nMarguerite  ( Drury Lane, 1789), and Charles Bonnor 's  Picture of\n\nParis in the Year 1790  ( Covent Garden, 1790), offered London\n\ntheater-goers an opportunity to cheer the actions of the people of Paris as\n\nthey liberated the Bastille in Dent 's play or freed the Man in the Iron Mask\n\nin St. John 's.\n These plays celebrate mass action and trace a movement from the\n\nenclosed spaces of the past-the prison, the castle, the convent-to the open\n\nspaces of a liberated future, a movement that marks them as parallel to the\n\nrevolutionary festivals analyzed by Mona Ozouf.\n In fact, many of these plays themselves end in festivals, not only of\n\npublic liberation but also of romantic union, an erotic liberation that is\n\nseen to arise with political liberty.\n This turn to the erotic is even clearer in the other potentially\n\nradical dramatic form of the day, the Gothic.\n\n  The Gothic drama may have its roots in such plays as Horace\n\nWalpole 's  Mysterious Mother  of 1768, but it did not become a major\n\nforce on the British stage until after 1789, the year of both the Bastille\n\nand the publication of Ann Radcliffe 's first novel.\n I have argued elsewhere that the Gothic was read at the time as an\n\nideologically charged form, a reading revealed powerfully in Coleridge 's \n\nBiographia  where he defines the Gothic as the  \" modern\n\njacobinical drama.\"6\n For present purposes, it is important to note that the Gothic, when it\n\ntraces the liberation of its lovers from past restrictions imposed by cruel\n\nfathers, lascivious lords, and fanatic monks moves to the rhythms of the\n\nrevolutionary spectacular; and when it instead emphasizes the erotic quest of\n\nthe villain-hero as he pursues pleasure in defiance of any limits, the Gothic\n\nportrays a more individual rebellion.\n The Gothic was seen as embracing either individual or collective\n\nrevolt, and its celebration of erotic liberation was particularly troubling\n\nto the defenders of official morality and culture.\n\n  ,\n\ntaken we are told  \" from a paragraph in a Newspaper during the French\n\nRevolution\" ( 99) and staged at the Royal Circus in 1797, offers a\n\nkind of compendium of these features of the prorevolutionary drama.\n It engages both the historical spectacle - drawing upon an actual\n\nevent and seeming to invoke the patters of revolutionary festival - and the\n\nGothic.\n It tells the story of Julia, loved by Clifford but also sought by the\n\nnoble St. Pierre.\n When she rejects the libidinous aristrocrat, he has her imprisoned in\n\na loathsome convent.\n The play climaxes when a crowd, led by officers of the Revolution,\n\nstorms the convent and Clifford liberates Julia from her dungeon.\n\n  Arising to counter such plays, the antirevolutionary drama also\n\nfaced what Ronald Paulson defines as the central problem of all artistic\n\nattempts to represent the Revolution.\n Since the Revolution was seen as an unprecedented event - even Burke\n\ncalled it  \" the most astonishing that has hitherto happened in the\n\nworld\" - the use of traditional forms and images to present it would\n\nmisrepresent its uniqueness.\n What genre does one use for an event that is sui generis? How is one\n\nto stage a conservative version of the radically new events of the\n\nrevolution?\n , in introducing its poetry section,\n\nmakes, albeit humorously, an astonishing suggestion - that poetry itself in a\n\nrevolutionary age might become revolutionary, that there might be no genre\n\nfor the conservative poet to adopt:   \" But whether it be that good\n\nMorals, or what we should call good Politics, are inconsistent with the\n\nspirit of true poetry-whether  'the Muses still with freedom found' \n\nhave an aversion to  regular  Governments...We have not been able to\n\nfind one good and true Poet, of sound principles and sober practice.\"9 Of\n\ncourse, as the poetry of the  Anti-Jacobin  itself demonstrates,\n\nconservatives did write.  \n\n\nAnti-Jacobin  itself, is to turn to parody, to attempt to undo or revise\n\nthe forms adopted by one 's opponents.\n It is significant that the greatest antirevolutionary art of the\n\nperiod is created by the caricaturists and that the antirevolutionary dramas\n\nwhich found some stage success tended to be satires on Jacobins.\n Another course was to react against the new forms arising within the\n\nBritish theaters of the 1790s and to return to traditional tragedy,\n\nparticularly neoclassical tragedy, as a declaration in formal terms that the\n\nRevolution was not new and that history finally spoke of noble individuals\n\nand not popular action.\n\n  We can discover the two key targets of the conservative drama 's\n\nrevisionary tactics in a satire that appeared in the  Anti-Jacobin \n\nduring June 1798.\n This weekly was founded by a group of Pitt 's supporters around\n\nGeorge Canning, made undersecretary of foreign affairs in 1796; it included\n\nJohn Hookham Frere, whose adaptation of octava rima would late inspire Byron,\n\nGeorge Ellis, who had earlier proved himself a satirist for the Whigs, and,\n\nas editor, William Gifford, who was brought in, Canning 's biographer tell us,\n\nbecause he could provide a  \" thoroughly brutal spirit.\"  10\n Whether or not the journal had financial support from the\n\ngovernment, it had the political support of a series of Tory aristocrats, and\n\nit is rumored that Pitt himself contributed to the journal 's parodies,\n\nincluding its great satire on Jacobin drama entitled  The Rovers; or The\n\nDouble Arrangement  .\n\n  The play attacks what it calls the German school of drama-what\n\nColeridge later, perhaps recalling this piece, relabels the  \" modern\n\njacobinical drama ( which, and not the German drama, is its appropriate\n\ndesignation).\"  11\n This school is seen as comprising on the one hand the Gothic and on\n\nthe other hand the plays literary history identifies as the drama of the \n\nSturm und Drang  , plays which are seen by the  Anti-Jacobin \n\nas immoral filth preaching  \" the reciprocal duties of one or more\n\nHusbands to one or more Wives\"(236). \n What, the play 's authors object to are British dramas that imitate\n\nforeign models in order to bring to the stage, first, acts of successful mob\n\nviolence against the authority of the church and nobility and, second, an\n\nideology of sexual liberation.\n\n  The Gothic drama is satirized in the story of one Rogero, who\n\nhas been imprisoned in an abbey by his father for loving a woman beneath his\n\nstation.\n His dungeon provides an opportunity to recite a litany of Gothic\n\nclich\u00e9s:   SCENE changes to Subterranean Vault in the Abbey of\n\nQUEDLINBURGH; with Coffins, 'Scutcheons, Death 's Heads and\n\nCross-bones.-Toads, and other loathsome Reptiles are seen traversing the\n\nobscurer parts of the Stage.-ROGERO appears, in chains, in a Suit of rusty\n\nArmour, with his beard grown, and a Cap of grotesque form upon his\n\nhead.-Beside him a Crock, or Pitcher, supposed to contain his daily allowance\n\nof sustenance.-A long silence, during which the wind is heard to whistle\n\nthrough the Caverns.(238)\n\n  Rogero is liberated from this dungeon in the final scene by a\n\nmob action that mimics the Gothic  Julia of Louvain  or  The\n\nIsland of St. Marguerite  or, for that matter, Dent 's  Bastille\n\n ; and the play ends with the figures of traditional authority, the\n\nprior and Rogero 's father, the count, being led off in chains.\n The action of the liberators is undercut, however, as their band-led\n\nby a man thought a waiter but revealed to be  \" No Waiter, but a \n\nKnight Templar  \"  ( 245)-is unable to defeat a body of  \"\n\nChoristers and Lay-brothers\" until Puddingfield and Beefington, two\n\nBritish barons in exile awaiting the signing of the  Magna Carta  ,\n\ncall for a battering ram and a Roman legion appears to complete the\n\nassault.12\n This single scene parodies many central images and ideas of the\n\nJacobins-the appeal to Roman precedent, the admiration for Saxon liberty, not\n\nto mention the belief in action by the people.\n The dramatic image of the people liberating castles and convents is\n\nhere ridiculed.\n Clearly only a nobleman, even if he is an exiled nobleman, or a\n\nRoman general, even if he is caught in a time warp, could complete such\n\nheroic action; no waiter-not even one who is also a Knight Templar-could ever\n\nchange history.\n\n  The other object of the satire-the popularity of such German\n\nplays as Schiller 's  Robbers  and  Cabal and Love  ,\n\nKotzebue 's  Stranger  , and Goethe 's  Stella  - is\n\nannounced in the prologue:  \n To-night our Bard, who scorns pedantic rules, His Plot has borrow'd\n\n'drom the GERMAN Schools; - The GERMAN Schools - where no dull maxims bind The\n\nbold expansion of th'electric mind. Fix'd to 'do period, circled by no space,\n\nHe leaps the flaming bounds of time and place.\n Round the dark confines of the Forest raves, With gentle ROBBERS\n\nstocks his gloomy caves; Tells how bad MINISTERS are shocking things, How\n\nreigning Dukes are just like tyrant Kings; How to two Swains one Nymph her\n\nvows may give, And how two Damsels with one Lover live! ( 237)\n\n  This passage makes an important link between political\n\nresistance to authority and the embrace of sexual freedom.\n\n\nvision, as is made clear in its prospectus, where it identifies its enemy as\n\n \" JACOBINISM in all its shapes, and in all its degrees, political and\n\nmoral, public and private, whether as it openly threatens the subversion of\n\nStates, or gradually saps the foundations of domestic happiness.\" \n\n\nThe Rovers  , the German drama calls for a new  \" SYSTEM\n\ncomprehending not Politics only, and Religion, but Morals and Manners, and\n\ngenerally whatever goes to the composition or holding together of Human\n\nSociety; in all of which a total change and Revolution is absolutely\n\nnecessary\"(236). \n Within the play, this attack upon domestic happiness is traced\n\nthrough the relations of Matilda, Rogero 's love and mother of his children,\n\nwho has also borne children by Casimere who is married to Cecilia; the cast\n\nlist includes the children of Matilda by Casimere, the children of Matilda by\n\nRogero, the children of Casimere and Cecilia along with  \" Several\n\nChildren; Fathers and Mothers unknown\"(237). \n Political revolution be abhorrent, but it is the prospect of sexual\n\nliberation-particularly the liberation of female sexuality-that is truly\n\nterrifying.\n\n  was neatly\n\nsummed up by William Cobbett in a poetic epistle to its editor, Gifford,\n\nabout his satire the  Baviad  .\n \"\n\ntheir gothic hands on social quiet laid, / And as they rave, unmindful of the\n\nstorm, / Call lust refinement, anarchy reform.\"  13\n This double assault upon popular rebellion and sexual liberation\n\ndefines the project of the antirevolutionary drama.\n This project, both ideological and generic, seeks to defeat the\n\ndangerous erotic power unleashed in both the Gothic and in revolutionary\n\nromances through an appeal to domesticity and patriarchal power in formal\n\nterms, there is an attempt to transform the Gothic into the domestic\n\nmelodrama.\n And there is also a struggle to replace the image of mass action\n\nwith conspiracy theories of isolated, ambitious men manipulating the foolish\n\npeople-in formal terms, the conversion of revolutionary spectaculars such as\n\nDent 's  Bastille  into neoclassical tragedies of intrigue.\n\n\n The attack upon the French Revolution as the site of sexual excess was\n\nestablished early, in, for example, Burke 's  Reflections on the\n\nRevolution in France  , as Paulson among others has pointed out.14\n Burke first works to establish the French royal family as a model of\n\ndomestic love and loyalty.\n Louis XVI, who had difficulty consummating his marriage, hardly made\n\nan ideal model for patriarchal potency, but Burke transforms him into an\n\nimage of manly and kingly prowess.\n In the figure of Louis confronting the mob at Versailles Burke\n\noffers us a perfect father, husband, and ruler:   \" As a man, it\n\nbecame him to feel for his wife and his children, and the faithful guards of\n\nhis person, that were massacred in cold blood about him; as a prince, it\n\nbecame him to feel for the strange and frightful transformation of his\n\ncivilized subjects, and to be more grieved for them, than solicitous for\n\nhimself\"(488).  \n Marie Antoinette was, if anything, a harder case, known for her\n\nflirtatiousness and revealing dress and attacked as an adulteress, lesbian,\n\nchild abuser, and even incestuous lover.\n \"\n\nBut the age of chivalry is gone\"-describes her as not only possessing\n\nbeauty,  \" glittering like a morning star, full of life, and splendor,\n\nand joy,\"  but also as embodying  \" lofty sentiments\"\n\nand the  \" dignity of a Roman matron\" ( 488-89).\n She thus manages to combine physical charm with the iron-clad\n\ndomestic virtue of the Roman wife and mother.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a9e90566-d7c2-49b8-aae8-6ed984c3e655", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.670661+00:00"}
{"text": "Paul Tsongas finally has some company.\n The ex-senator from Massachusetts, who had been billing himself as \"\n\nthe world 's supply of Democratic presidential candidates,\" was joined over\n\nthe weekend by two Democrats who couldn't be more unalike: Virginia 's\n\ngovernor, L. Douglas Wilder, and Iowa 's junior senator, Tom Harkin.\n After months of drooping lifelessly, the fabled \" big tent\" of the\n\nDemocratic Party is billowing.\n\n  Lately the GOP has taken to calling itself a \" big tent,\" too (\n\nmostly to make a virtue of its inability to come together on such emotional\n\nsocial/moral issues as abortion and gay rights).\n But while there may be divergent voices within Republican ranks on\n\neverything from the federal budget to the \" new world order,\" the only\n\nRepublican voice that will count in 1992 will be George Bush 's.\n\n  Happily for American voters, that won't be true of the Democrats.\n Wilder and Harkin bring profoundly different visions and ideals to the\n\npresidential campaign.\n And out of the clash of their opinions and attitudes in the months\n\nahead, the Democratic Party may finally get a clue to what it stands for and\n\nwhere it is headed.\n\n  After Michael Dukakis' defeat in 1988, the Democrats were riven\n\nby a debate between those who believe he could have beaten Bush if only he'd\n\nbeen more forth 'dghtly liberal, and those who insist--correctly, we think - -\n\nthat the Democrats will never retake the White House until their presidential\n\ncandidates abandon the kookiness of their party 's left wing.\n\n  That debate is mirrored in the contrasts between Harkin and\n\nWilder.\n\n  Harkin represents the Democratic Party 's left--the higher-taxes,\n\nbigger- government, class-warfare, Water-gate-baby fringe.\n Wilder, by contrast, comes from the party 's moderate center--on a\n\nplatform dubbed \" The New Mainstream,\" he campaigns against taxes, against\n\nWashington, against deficits, against moral licentiousness.\n Passionately, Harkin calls for cutting\n\n&dollar;160 billion from the defense budget and plowing it into the traditional slew\n\nof domestic programs.\n Wilder sings a very different tune promising to cut\n\n&dollar;50 billion from the federal budget and return it in the form of tax cuts.\n Blacks of his age grew up, he says, believing \" that the government\n\nimposed too many restrictions, too many barriers, too many limitations.\n We were not asking government for anything... but to remove\n\nitself.?\n\n  Wilder reflects the Democratic Party 's serious core; Harkin, its\n\nangry excesses.\n Both men have flaws, but both are superb campaigners.\n\n\n\n  The peace pact in the conflict over the disputed province of\n\nNagorno- Karabakh offers hope that the newly independent Soviet republics can\n\nsettle their differences without coercion from a dictatorial central\n\ngovernment.\n\n  The province, part of Muslim Azerbaijan, has an Armenian majority\n\nand an Azeri minority, a situation which has led to demands for union with\n\nneighboring Armenia and fighting between the rival republics and contentious\n\nethnic factions.\n\n  Through the good offices of Russian Federation President Boris\n\nYeltsin and Nursultan Naza bayev, the president of Kazakhstan, a truce was\n\nnegotiated among all the parties involved.\n The accord calls for further negotiations to resolve differences,\n\ndisarming of rival gangs within the province, and an effort to resettle\n\nrefugees.\n\n  Most importantly, Armenia has renounced any claims to the area.\n In return, Azerbaijan has agreed to grant more autonomy to the\n\nprovince 's Armenians.\n\n  One reason the West was reluctant to support independence\n\nmovements within the Soviet Union was the fear that the forces pulling the\n\nunion apart would unleash ancient ethnic hatreds, leading to a generation of\n\nmini-conflicts.\n But three years of fighting, which left more than 800 dead and half a\n\nmillion homeless, belies the argument that the Kremlin was in any wise an\n\neffective peace-keeper.\n Newly liberated national groups aren't stupid.\n While there is considerable competition for contested territory, they\n\nrealize that peace is essential to the development of democratic institutions\n\nand the move to a market economy. \n\n  For many of these groups, the breakup of the Soviet empire (\n\nsuccessor of czarist imperialism) offers the first real prospect of freedom\n\nand independence in hundreds of years.\n They aren't about to throw away that opportunity in border\n\ndisputes.\n\n\n\n  The decision to hire a private company to provide medical\n\nservices to Massachusetts prisoners, said Gov. William Weld last Thursday, \"\n\nis an excellent example of the privatization approach we plan to employ\n\nthroughout state government.\" It 's a pretty mild and straightforward\n\napproach: A spend-thrift and inefficient firm that had been mostly staffed\n\nwith state workers will be replaced with a private firm, whose payroll will\n\nbe its own responsibility and which will be bound by stiff contractual\n\nobligations.\n\n  Of course, a more radical-minded privatizer would want to see the\n\nwhole kit and caboodle privatized - - not just medical services but the\n\nrunning of all prison operations.\n We don't know if Weld the Downsizer has dared to think such\n\nunconventional thoughts.\n But guess what?\n\n\n  Under Chapter 799 of the Acts of 1985, the commonwealth is \"\n\nauthorized to enter into a contract with a private organization for the\n\nfinancing, operation, and maintenance of one state correctional facility.\"\n The Legislature 's interest in trying a different way of doing\n\ncorrections--it backed up the statute with a budgetary authorization - - was\n\ncommendable.\n\n  Sadly, predictably, the then-governor flatly refused to consider\n\nanything that would reduce the scope or expense of government.\n \" Given the cost and control issues involved in privatization of\n\ncorrection,\" Gov. Dukakis wrote in April 1986, \" I could not support any such\n\neffort in this area at this time.\u001d\n\n  Times have changed.\n So has the thinking in the corner office.\n Across-the- board prison-privatization is a reform to consider anew;\n\ncontracting out inmate medical care is a very good first step.\n\n  Under the Dukakis regime, Goldberg Medical Associates of Salem\n\nprovided medical services for the Correction Department.\n That was the firm whose boss collected\n\n&dollar;192,000 per year, charged most of his Lincoln Continental to the taxpayers,\n\nand had 400 state employees working for him.\n By the time Goldberg got finished enjoying his perks, the per-inmate\n\ncost of medical services in Massachusetts was twice the national average.\n\n  By contracting the work out, Weld expects to cut the state\n\npayroll by 250, to slash the frequency of outside medical trips for inmates,\n\nand to save taxpayers more than\n\n&dollar;8 million.\n\n  Privatization has a stellar track record.\n The more Massachusetts tries it, the more Massachusetts ( except the\n\nformer governor, maybe) will take it.\n\n\n\n  In the past five years, the number of murders committed by\n\njuveniles has doubled.\n\n  But while current state law allows for juveniles charged with\n\ncertain serious and violent crimes to be tried as adults, the system has\n\nfailed to work as intended.\n In 1989, only 11 of 169 cases were successfully transferred from\n\njuvenile to adult criminal court.\n\n\n  But the numbers tell us little about the real\n\ninjustice--injustices which rest most heavily on the shoulders of the\n\nvictim 's families, for in most instances the victims too were children.\n\n  Such was the case of Damien Bynoe, 16, who was charged with the\n\nmurders of 11-year-old Charles Copney and 15-year-old Corey Grant.\n\n  \" As soon as a judge ruled Bynoe could not be tried as an adult,\n\nhe changed his plea to guilty,\" Gov. William Weld said Thursday in announcing\n\nhis legislation to charge the juvenile justice system.\n Thus, guilty of two cold- blooded killings, Bynoe will be a free man\n\nat age 21.\n\n  \" A system that puts a convicted murderer back on the streets\n\njust because he turns 21 is a system that has failed,\" Weld said, as the\n\nparents of the two youthful victims looked on.\n\n  Weld 's bill would remove those aged 14 to 17 who are charged with\n\nfirst- or second-degree murder, manslaughter, aggravated rape, armed assault\n\nwith intent to murder, or armed burglary from the jurisdiction of the\n\njuvenile court.\n Those charged with lesser offenses could still be transferred to\n\ncriminal court but under this proposal all transfer hearings would be public\n\nand any offense involving a firearm would be subject to transfer\n\nproceedings.\n\n  Given the increases in juvenile crime and the violent nature of\n\nfar too many of those offenses, the increases in gang-related violence, and\n\nthe terror it has brought on too many inner city neighborhoods, this\n\nlegislation comes not a moment too soon.\n\n  If there is a flaw in the current proposal it is one of omission.\n Weld will need to come up with some real answers about where these\n\nno-longer-juvenile offenders will be housed, if for no other reason than to\n\ndeprive reluctant legislators of a reason to kill the bill before it ever\n\nsees the light of day.\n This is much too important an issue to be allowed to languish on\n\nBeacon Hill.\n\n\n  Jean-Bertrand Arlstide 's landslide election as president of Haiti\n\nless than eight months ago was historic.\n The popular Roman Catholic priest, who espouses peace and is revered\n\nby many, became Haiti 's first democratically elected president in the\n\ncountry 's 200 year history.\n The United Nations and the Organization of American States monitored\n\nthe Haitian elections, and helped ensure that the Haitian people could vote\n\nwithout fear of violence and bloodshed.\n\n  Historically, Haiti 's leaders have been determined by military\n\nmight.\n\n\n  That was supposed to have changed with Aristide 's election.\n But old ways die hard.\n Last Sunday night, Aristide was ousted by Brig. Gen. Raoul Cedras,\n\nhis provisional commander-in-chief, turned leader of a coup.\n The general claims that the rebellion occurred because Aristide\n\nabused his power.\n Aristide, from exile, said that during the coup Cedras confronted him\n\nat the National Palace and said.\n\n\n  The OAS, which is normally committed to regional democracy and\n\nworked to mid-wife Haitian democracy, has imposed diplomatic and economic\n\nsanctions against the military junta, in an effort to pressure Cedras to step\n\ndown and return Aristide to the presidency.\n Many Haitian-Americans are up-set at the lack of a stronger response\n\nand at a lack of response by the United Nations.\n\n  For now, the response has been appropriate.\n The OAS has enough collective power to teach Cedras, and all the\n\nother potential Cedrases in small countries where democracy is new and\n\nfragile, that violence is no longer the ticket to the presidency.\n It is imperative that talk be tried and sanctions imposed before the\n\nmilitary is brought in and more blood 19 shed.\n\n  The OAS has the power to use \" any measures\" appropriate to\n\nrestore constitutional rule in Haiti and should, if that proves necessary.\n But the first measure democratic nations should use must be\n\nnon-violent.\n\n\n\n  The ugly accusation that President George Bush is an anti-Semite,\n\nleveled by a member of the Israeli Knesset over the weekend, is an\n\nembarrassment to that nation and to its supporters in the United States.\n\n  The smear was prompted by the president 's demand that Congress\n\npostpone action on Jerusalem 's request for\n\n&dollar;10 billion in loan guarantees.\n <Rehavam Ze'evi, a member of an obscure p arty and minister without\n\nportfolio in the Shamir government, reportedly accused the president of being\n\nmotivated by anti-Semitism.\n Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens immediately repudiated the\n\ncharge, stating that it reflected the views neither of the government nor the\n\nIsraeli public.\n\n  One needn't agree with the president 's position of using\n\nhumanitarian aid as a club to bring Israel to the conference table, to be\n\nappalled by such allegations.\n <George Bush may be accused of many thing s, including ingratitude\n\ntoward a loyal ally and a myopic view of where America 's regional interests\n\nlie.\n\n\n  As vice president, Mr. Bush was directly involved in the effort\n\nto rescue Ethiopian Jews.\n After the first massive air lift from Ethiopia to Israel, hundreds\n\nof refugees were left stranded in Sudanese camps.\n Informed of their plight, Bush put together the State Department\n\nteam that eventually negotiated their departure.\n\n  After the fall of Ethiopia 's Marxist regime, the administration\n\nworked with the interim government to secure the exodus of several hundred\n\nJews who remained in the country.\n\n\n  Such despicable, baseless accusations can only exacerbate an\n\nalready acrimonious debate.\n <Let the loan guarantees be discussed on their merits, without a\n\nresort to ad hominem arguments by either side.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f470d44d-038f-422c-b4c2-efd314fef289", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.672014+00:00"}

- the person who I\n\ntook the longest to write to.\n I really don't know why that is, but I just haven't gotten around to\n\nit.\n I suppose it 's because when I write to you, I want it to be this\n\nmega-awesome letter that you'll absolutely orgasm ove 'll\n Well, maybe not quite that good.\n\n\n  1)I started going out with a Japanese woman yesterday\n 2)I have found a drumset to use, but as of yet have done little\n\njamming\n 3)Japan and Japanese food remain pretty difficult, although I still\n\nhaven't been to McDonald 's yet\n 4)I miss school and home\n 5)Classes are really bad, and I just found out that all of my grades\n\ncount towards my gpa!\n\n\n  Well, now to describe those in a little more detail.\n A few weeks after I got here, I met this really cool woman at a party\n\nat this place near a lake called Karasaki House.\n Her name was Yuka, and I spent the next several weeks trying to catch\n\nthe same train as she did and striking up conversation.\n She was willing enough to have conversation, but she does everything\n\nunder the sun, and our schedules conflicted, so we couldn't manage to even\n\nget together for lunch or anything.\n Plus, there are 10,000 students on this campus, so I very rarely run\n\ninto her around campus - - I have to go out of my way to meet her, like\n\nwaiting for her train in the station or something.\n Anyway, one of the ways I've managed to make some frie 've is through\n\nteaching English and going out with my \" students\" ( Doshisha students) after\n\nour lesson.\n An even better way to get them talking is to tell them that I'm\n\ninterested in a Japanese wom 'm, and what should I do?\n So I did this, and got all sorts of conversation about it.\n So it became a sort of habit to ask my Japanese friends what to do\n\nabout this Yuka - situation.\n About this time I started talking a lot to this student named Maki\n\nwho spent some time in England, so she likes to hang out near our office and\n\nchat.\n So, we became pretty good friends, and she became my main confidante\n\nfor the largely stagnant Yuka thing.\n Now, you're probably thinking that 'reething was going to happen with\n\nMaki, and I must admit I pondered it, because she is exceedingly cool as well\n\nas attractive, but she had been going out with this guy for 2 years, so that\n\nwas out of the question.\n Sort of.\n Turns out she broke up with him very recently, for reasons supposedly\n\nunrelated to me, and now wants to go out with me.\n Well, we spent most of the past week together, and yesterday we\n\nstarted \" going out,\" which seems to have about the same connotations here as\n\nit does in America.\n So, I'm pretty excited about the whole 'mhing.\n I still think a lot about that woman Laura from Bucknell, but she\n\nkept on insisting that I should live my own life while I'm here, and then\n\nthis Maki th 'mg happened and well, here we are! \n\n  As far as music goes, I've had one serious jam sess 've since I\n\ngot here, and that was just with this guitarist from Oberlin named [ - - - ]\n\nwho will most likely be in any band I form, but I still haven't had much\n\nopportunity to play.\n This guitarist is into funk, but he doesn't really play like either\n\nof the Jasons I played with.\n He 's a little more poppy, which isn't necessarily good.\n He 's really into \" not-playing,\" like arpeggios and random chords,\n\nsort of like [ - - - ] of Rush or [ - - - ] , but not really.\n Anyway, without a bass player it wasn't much fun, especially\n\nconsidering his style of play.\n The drumset I get to use is owned by the club I'm sort of in, called\n\nLilac 'mainbows ( lord knows why), and its okay - it 's sort of a beat-up Tama\n\nwith an okay sound.\n All I have to bring of my own is a snare and a pedal, which I borrow\n\nfrom this fat metal drummer.\n The music clubs here have enormous rooms filled with exceedingly\n\nexpensive equipment, which just blows away any music scene at Conn.\n For instance, Lilac Rainbows 's room is about the size of our entire\n\nfirst floor at home!!\n The only problem is, the bands aren't that good at all.\n They are all technically good, but they are lacking in raw energy.\n If we weren't that precise and clean-sounding, I think that the [ - -\n\n- ] certainly had a lot of energy, and that 's part of what made us kick so\n\nmuch ass!\n Anyway, the other problem here is that Japanese people haven't a clue\n\nhow to dance!\n If I perform, I'm gonna have to import a f 'm of my Conn friends to do\n\nthe dancing.\n There are a few spazzy Americans here, so maybe if they get going,\n\nthe Japanese people will get into it.\n I sure hope so.\n Believe it or not, I did a lot of practicing the first month or so.\n It was even the stuff I should be practicing - - rudiments.\n However, since Fall Break in Shikoku and catching up after break, I\n\nhaven't touched my sticks in ages.\n I did, however, find this amazing [ - - - ] disc called Master Plan\n\nthat kicks ass.\n Look for it if you get a chance, or maybe I'll send you a tap 'llf it.\n I really want to learn jazz, and also latin styles, but I have yet to\n\nlearn how to totally detach one limb and just keep playing the same thing\n\nlike one does in jazz and samba.\n Besides, I need to learn my rudiments first!!\n I really miss the [ - - - ] , and every time I hear another band I\n\nbecome convinced that there is some sort of future in it, so who knows, hunh?\n Our time will come again!!\n By the way, I just bought this bargain Earth, Wind and Fire cd last\n\nnight.\n Pretty funky!\n They have some amazing horn parts, I just wish they wouldn't do so\n\nmany mellow songs.\n\n\n  And now for something completely different - - a man with 9 legs.\n ( \" He ran away!!\")\n\n\n  So.\n Things here are busy - - my homestay is good, but we barely talk at\n\nall, because we're all so busy.\n<IC 'reSA:#68:1> One of the toughest things about living with a homestay is that I\n\nhave a curfew - - something I didn't even have when I lived at home!!\n My curfew is 10 on weekdays and 11 on weekends, and it takes an hour\n\nto get home from the city, so I have to leave at 9 or 10 on weekends, which\n\nreally limits things, if you know what I mean.\n I really miss living in a dorm and being able to sit in someone 's\n\nroom and just talk or listen to music or show people all my stupid music and\n\ndoing drum fills in the air.\n I still haven't picked up any \" traditional Japanese arts,\" but Will\n\nand I are thinking of starting Aikido ( a martial art) if we have the time\n\nand the money. \n\n  This class thing has me really bend out of shape, because now\n\nwith only 5 weeks ( 4 when you read this) left in the semester, I have to try\n\nand salvage my grades so I don't kill the gpa I worked so hard to get last\n\nsemester.\n Luckily, I've been improving r 'vedly in Japanese, and that counts for\n\n8 credits ( 2 courses), because it meets 600 minutes a week.\n My test grades have climbed steadily from 79 on the first one to 99\n\non the last one, and I have another one tomorrow.\n I really want to end up with a gpa of over 3.5, and at least a 3.67\n\nso I can get summa cum laude.\n 3.8 is magna cum laude, and that would be fantastic, but I doubt I\n\ncan pull that off.\n Anyway, my sociology class is perhaps the worst course I've taken in\n\nmy l 've, so ifs hard to get motivated for that one.\n Oh well, now 's crunch time.\n If I can pull off an \" A\" in Japanese, that should help me salvage my\n\nelective courses.\n\n\n  So, how are things in Mass.?\n Mom mentioned something about you getting a job teaching!\n That sounds like fun, although I've discovered that 'vem far from a\n\ngra 'm-A teacher.\n .I teach twice a week - - one to a group of 6 or 7 students, and once\n\nto this middle-aged stomach surgeon.\n Some fun conversations there, I can tell you.\n The students are by far the more exciting of the two, but it 's\n\namazing how bad their English is.\n I mean, these people take English for about 10 years, and I speak\n\nbetter than they do after one year!\n The problem is, they don't do my speaking in class, only reading and\n\nwriting.\n They know pretty colossal amounts of vocabulary, but even the ones\n\nwho have been to America have a lot of trouble putting together a simple\n\nsentence, and they have a lot of trouble with the pronunication, especially\n\nr 's, l 's, and w 's.\n They always say \" uuman\" instead of \" woman.\" Sometimes I just feel\n\nlike cracking up in class, but I'm sure they do, 'moo, when I speak in\n\nJapanese, so it 's all even.\n The doctor is also pretty bad, and I don't really like the 1-on-1\n\nteaching, although I do get 3000 yen an hour, which is above\n\n&dollar;20 an hour.\n Of course, things here are much more expensive, plus you have to take\n\npublic transportation everywhere, so it really isn't that much, but it 's\n\nenough so I haven't had to ask Mom for any money yet, which is cool. \n\n  The language is just really difficult.\n I think I speak very well for what I know, but I just have little to\n\nno vocabulary, and I have a lot of trouble understanding, plus I have a lot\n\nmore grammar to learn ( verb forms and all).\n Of course, it doesn't help that they speak a dialect here called\n\nKyoto-ben ( \" ben\" meaning dialect), where all of the verb endings are\n\nchanged.\n It 's pretty much a pain in my ass, and it makes the whole thing\n\nconsiderably more difficult than I'd hope 'd\n You know how everyone says that there 's this point where all of a\n\nsudden you understand everything?\n Well, it 's been two months now, and I haven't had that part yet.\n I do, however, understand most of what they announce on the trains,\n\nwhich are just as ridiculously precise as everyone cracks them up to be.\n To give you an idea, I was waiting for a train that was, according\n\nto the clock on the schedule board, about 1 minute late.\n I overheard these two salarymen next to me talking about it, and one\n\nsaid, \" Tabun, tokee wa kosyoo shite iru n da yo.\"\n Loosely translated, \" The clock is probably broken.\"\n Sheesh.\n Of course, I could have misunderstood.\n It 's all irrelevant, though, because the trains run so frequently\n\nthat I just show up at the station, and there 's invariably a train going my\n\nway within the next 5 minutes, and my station is this piss-ant little one\n\nthat only the local trains stop at! \n\n  Mom said she was going to send you my tape - - I hope you\n\nenjoyed it.\n Unfortunately, I have a big test in about 20 minutes, and I really\n\nhave to go to the bathroom, so I'm going 'mo stop here and come back and\n\nfinish this after lunch.\n Of course, it will only be a few seconds to you, but try to picture\n\nme going to the bathroom and taking a test, ( not at the same time,\n\nobviously) and you'll 'll an idea of what my life is like.\n Actually, you should probably not try to picture me going to the\n\nbathroom.\n Anyway, talk to you in a few.\n I guess I'll 'llk about my return to the US when I get back, and I\n\nfiggered I'd 'dite this so I don't forget what I'm ta 'ming about... \n\n\n  Okay, so here I am, writing you letter again.\n It 's now tomorrow ( if such a thing can happen), and I'm b 'mk in the\n\ncomputer room with good 'ol [ - - - ] , and for some strange reason, I'm\n\n'mletting her read my letter to you.\n Stop reading!!!!!\n Just kidding.\n Anyway, once again I'm n 'm going to be able to finish this letter,\n\nbecause I have to go to class in a few minutes and take an all-too-exciting\n\nkanji quiz that I haven't studied for because I've 'veen bura-bura suru-ing\n\nwith Maki.\n Anyway, about my return to the US, seeing as everyone who writes\n\nasks when I'm 'mming home.\n The AKP program ends on May 13th, so that 's the earliest I' 'llbe\n\nhome, and after that it 's up to me whether or not I want to stay for the\n\nsummer.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e23cec3b-fa9b-4dbc-880d-389f83cd95e0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.673365+00:00"}
{"text": "When Americans went off to fight the Persian Gulf War, one of the\n\ngreatest Threats they faced was from land mines, high-explosive metal\n\ncanisters the forces of Saddam Hussein buried by the hundreds of thousands in\n\nthe sands of Kuwait and Iraq.\n U.S. troops in Somalia face the same threat.\n At least American soldiers are accompanied by personnel trained to\n\nlocate and destroy antipersonnel mines.\n\n  But who makes old war zones safe for the civilians, particularly\n\nthe children, who are left behind when the troops depart?\n\n\n  The Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, which has been\n\nfighting a campaign against antipersonnel mines, estimates they kill 4,000\n\npeople every month in Angola alone.\n In Cambodia, where land mines have been used in war for decades, one\n\nin every 236 people is an amputee.\n According to the U.S. State Department, 1-million children in\n\nAfghanistan have been killed or injured by antipersonnel mines.\n\n  As many as 100-million of the potentially lethal mines lie buried\n\nin places such as Kuwait and Iraq and Somalia and Angola and Mozambique, and\n\nno one knows exactly where.\n\n  The United States, which makes land mines, has stopped exporting\n\nthem.\n Congress passed a one-year moratorium in 1992, and last fall extended\n\nit in other three years.\n It should have happened sooner.\n The United States was one of the 53 countries that signed a 1981\n\nUnited Nations convention limiting the use of mines, among other weapons,\n\nagainst civilians, but Presidents Reagan and Bush never submitted the\n\nagreement to the Senate for ratification.\n\n  Now the Clinton administration has taken the lead through the\n\nU.S. representative to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, who has called\n\nland mines \" the coward 's weapons of choice.?\n The United States has asked the 40 nations that manufacture\n\nantipersonnel mines - the leading exporters are Russia, Italy and China - to\n\nstop for at least three years.\n Albright persuaded 75 other nations to sign on to a successful\n\nGeneral Assembly resolution calling for a global moratorium on land mine\n\nexport.\n\n  Moreover, the United States has earmarked\n\n&dollar; 20-million to develop land mine detection-and-clearing technology and to\n\ntrain people living in and around war zones in the use of the technology for\n\nthe protection of themselves and their families.\n\n  It 's frightening to imagine how many have been maimed or killed\n\nin the 12 years that have passed since the Reagan administration turned its\n\nback on the first effort by the United Nations to begin the process of\n\nridding the world of land mines.\n But the process has begun now.\n The United States can't solve the problem alone, but it is to the\n\ncredit of the Clinton administration that we are trying, and we are actively\n\nand successfully recruiting other nations to join the effort.\n\n\n  Congratulations to the St. Petersburg Times for giving the most\n\nimportant progressive and humanitarian news of this decade front page\n\ncoverage! I'm referring to Walter Annenberg 's d 'mation of a\n\nhalf-billion-dollars to education! Finally, there was news that kicked off\n\nMichael Jackson and ( almost) Marla 's\n\n&dollar; 2-million tiara.\n With most charitable institutions regretfully reporting less revenues\n\nthan past seasons, this is a memorable gesture.\n\n\n  In light of the surprisingly strong showing of anti-reform\n\ncandidates in Russia 's parliamentary elections, American officials are now\n\nsuggesting that Western governments should relax their insistence on\n\nso-called \" shock therapy\" for the Russian economy.\n They say the election results sent a powerful message that the\n\nRussian people are growing weary of sweeping economic reforms that have not\n\nyet had a positive effect on their daily lives.\n\n  Strobe Talbott, the Clinton administration 's top Russia\n\nspecialist, says Washington should now concentrate on helping President Boris\n\nYeltsin 's government provide \" less shock and more therapy for the Russian\n\npeople.?\n That 's sensible advice.\n Grand economic theories sometimes must give way to hard political\n\nrealities.\n Russia 's government now faces the very real need to act to ease the\n\nshort-term pain of economic reform, even if that means slowing the pace of\n\nthe transition to a market economy.\n Otherwise, millions of Russians will become even more susceptible to\n\nthe demagoguery of old Communists, or of new-styled fascists such as Vladimir\n\nZhirinovsky.\n\n  The United States' own economic problems obviously aren't nearly\n\nthat serious or dramatic, but the Clinton administration and the Federal\n\nReserve Board have been engaged in an American version of the \" shock\n\ntherapy\" debate: One group of economists insists that the federal government\n\nmust continue to emphasize deficit reduction and inflation control, even at\n\nthe risk of slowing the economy and abandoning much of the president 's\n\noriginal domestic agenda.\n Others insist that the president 's proposed investment in public\n\nworks projects and other pro-growth spending programs, already delayed for a\n\nyear, should now go forward.\n\n  Administration officials said last week that their 1995 budget\n\nproposal would, when adjusted for inflation, leave total domestic spending\n\nbelow the levels established by the Bush administration.\n Those numbers still could change.\n If that proposal remains intact, though, it would constitute a\n\nstunning retreat from the president 's original promise of new investment in\n\npublic works programs, education, job training and other basic domestic\n\nneeds.\n\n  If the president still feels the need to prove the seriousness of\n\nhis commitment to deficit-reduction, this budget proposal should satisfy any\n\nremaining doubters.\n However, the deficit for the current fiscal year is now projected to\n\ncome in well below the administration 's original target.\n In the meantime, millions of Americans suffer the growing\n\nconsequences of social problems the federal government failed to address\n\nthroughout the 1980s.\n It 's not just our roads and bridges that are decaying.\n The foundations of many of our schools, neighborhoods and communities\n\nare collapsing, too.\n\n  The challenge for the Clinton administration and Congress is to\n\nfind the appropriate balance between maintaining a long-term commitment to\n\ndeficit reduction and responding to the immediate crises that only the\n\nfederal government can address.\n In fairness to President Clinton, his ( and the country 's) options\n\nare severely limited as a result of the huge deficits accumulated by his\n\npredecessors.\n The country simply cannot afford to adopt even the relatively modest\n\ndomestic agenda the president originally proposed.\n\n  At the same time, though, the country cannot afford to continue\n\nto ignore crises in health care, education, the environment, criminal justice\n\nand other domestic issues that have been all but neglected.\n As Russia 's disturbing experience reminds us, people eventually\n\nbecome alienated - and susceptible to the easy answers of demagogues - when\n\ntheir government seems unable or unwilling to meet its most basic\n\nresponsibilities to them.\n The allegations of misconduct\n\nin office against U.S. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., keep mounting, with no\n\nend of the official investigation in sight.\n Meanwhile, at least eight Democrats have declared their intention to\n\nrun against him in the 1994 House primary, some in a genuine effort to beat\n\nhim, others to act as spoilers to help him win re-election.\n\n  Yet with all the distractions, Rostenkowski continues to be an\n\neffective legislator.\n He helped the Clinton administration pass its budget and NAFTA this\n\nyear, and he is certain to be a major player when health care takes center\n\nstage next year.\n\n  The federal investigation of the powerful chairman of the House\n\nWays and means Committee began last May.\n It has covered a variety of allegations: that Rostenkowski cashed in\n\nstamps from his congressional office and pocketed the money; that he used tax\n\nmoney for cars and a phantom office in his Chicago district; and now, that\n\ntenants of buildings owned by his family, full-time Chicago city employees\n\nand former congressional employees were receiving payments from\n\nRostenkowski 's congressional office without any evidence they did any work\n\nfor the money.\n\n  The newest reports come from interviews by the Chicago Sun-Times.\n Among the allegations are that Rostenkowski kept a Chicago alderman 's\n\nwife on his payroll for five years after she resigned to have children; that\n\nhis congressional office paid two elderly tenants in a building his family\n\nowned, although they did no work; and that a woman who used to work in one\n\ncongressional office told a grand jury she had never seen a man who\n\npurportedly worked with her and collected\n\n&dollar; 48,000 on Rostenkowski 's payroll over a four-year period.\n\n  It 's difficult to understand why, after eight months of\n\ninvestigation, the Justice Department hasn't acted on any of the evidence\n\namassed in these allegations, assuming action is warranted.\n There 's a cynical inclination to assume the Democratic Justice\n\nDepartment is deliberately going slowly to preserve for as long as possible\n\nRostenkowski 's ability to help push President Clinton 's agenda through\n\nCongress.\n\n  But there 's also a question of fairness.\n Reports on allegations against Rostenkowski have been trickling out\n\nalmost as long as the investigation has been going on.\n Even grand jury witnesses are talking to newspapers.\n It isn't supposed to happen this way, and even if Rostenkowski is\n\nguilty of everything he is alleged to have done, simple fairness says, get it\n\nover with.\n Indict him or clear him.\n This has gone on long enough.\n\n\n\n  President Clinton 's selection of Bobby Ray Inman to succeed\n\nSecretary of Defense Les Aspin sent much of official Washington into throes\n\nof ecstasy.\n Inman, a retired admiral and veteran of a variety of intelligence\n\nagencies, is the consummate insider 's insider, a man so entrenched in the\n\nways of the federal city he has spawned his own generation of spinoffs,\n\nproteges he trained who now serve in high government positions of their\n\nown.\n\n  While Washington insiders applaud, there 's a lot about Bobby Ray\n\nInman Washington outsiders might find unsettling.\n\n  The matter of not paying Social Security tax for a housekeeper is\n\nthe least of what 's troubling about Inman.\n Until that issue began bumping Clinton nominees off their tracks,\n\nnobody gave it much thought.\n What 's worth noting, however, is the lameness of the White House\n\nexcuse that Inman didn't make things right with the IRS until he knew he\n\nwould get the Defense nomination because he thought the tax rules might\n\nchange to exempt cases like his.\n\n  Far more troubling is Inman 's work history since leaving the\n\nfederal government in 1982 after overseeing the most expensive intelligence\n\nbuildup in U.S. history.\n He embarked immediately on a career as a magnate of the civilian\n\ndefense industry - a position meant to trade on his Washington contacts.\n Inman 's private career could be described, charitably, as a\n\nflamboyant failure.\n\n  He presided over a leveraged buyout that led a Fortune 500\n\ndefense contractor straight into bankruptcy.\n He served as chairman and chief executive of that company, Tracor,\n\nInc., of Austin, Texas.\n He also was recruited as chairman of Westmark Systems Inc., an\n\ninvestment group.\n Westmark bought Tracor for\n\n&dollar; 714-million - 23 times the company 's earnings, an excessive price by any\n\nreckoning - a month before the stock market crash of 1987.\n The junk bonds that financed the deal became virtually worthless, and\n\ntwo years later - the year Inman was paid\n\n&dollar; 1-million in salary, compensation and bonuses - Tracor filed for Chapter 11\n\nprotection.\n\n  Inman also founded a consortium of computer software and hardware\n\nmanufacturers with the idea they would pool their efforts to compete against\n\nJapan.\n The trouble was, he couldn't get IBM and AT&T to participate, and\n\nwithout them, the grand plan had no hope of success.\n\n  One Washingtonian who knows Inman well describes him as a man\n\nadept at spending money but nearly dysfunctional when it comes to raising it,\n\nsaving it or managing it to cut costs.\n That 's a disquieting assessment of the man expected to oversee a\n\nbudget belt-tightening at the Pentagon dictated by the deficit and changing\n\ninternational politics.\n\n  At the same time, Inman has a lot of friends and supporters in\n\nWashington who vouch for his management skills and probity.\n Many of these people are members of Congress and journalists to whom\n\nInman has ingratiated himself over the years.\n That 's not a constituency normally associated with military and\n\nintelligence types, but Inman has courted them well.\n\n  Their collective sense that Inman is a good and decent man can't\n\nbe dismissed out-of-hand, any more than their judgment that he has the\n\nbaseline experience for the Pentagon job.\n And Inman sounded refreshingly independent when he announced, with\n\nClinton standing at his side, that he voted for President Bush last year.\n\n  But it bordered on arrogance when Inman went on to say that he\n\nhadn't accepted this nomination until he talked to Clinton and reached \" a\n\nlevel of comfort\" that the president was suitable to be commander in chief,\n\nalmost as though he were interviewing Clinton for employment instead of the\n\nother way around.\n\n  Perhaps that 's a residue of the years Inman was a boss.\n But at this stage of his career, it bespeaks the attitude of a man\n\ntoo convinced of the correctness of his opinions, too entrenched in his own\n\npersonal ethic.\n Given recent disclosures of Inman 's willingness to trade on his\n\ngovernment service for very large personal gain, and given the ineptitude of\n\nthat effort, arrogance is a scary ingredient in the mix.\n\n  Let 's hope he learned something from his failures in the private\n\nsector.\n Just as important, let 's hope the Senate will assure the American\n\npeople of that before sending this manipulator of the military-industrial\n\ncomplex off to manage it.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5af144c2-3a8e-43cf-a3a1-6a16d8467804", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.674598+00:00"}
{"text": "As the World Wide Web begins to outgrow its academic and\n\nscientific beginnings, the limitations of its standard language, HTML (\n\nHyperText Markup Language) become more evident.\n The Web has grown considerably and stands to become a powerful if not\n\ndominant medium of mass communication.\n If this is to happen, the Web must be able to effectively compete with\n\nits mass-media counterparts: television, radio, and print-media.\n To do this, the needs of creative people-- designers, artists,\n\nmusicians, must be taken into account.\n We should ask \" how do the tools of traditional media content creators\n\ndiffer from those of the Web designer?\"\n One answer is that theirs are powerful and creativetools - - which\n\nallow the creative process to work unimpeded.\n Simply said, what they need is the flexibility to create what they\n\nimagine, and the ability to do that in the way they choose.\n All this with a reasonable assurance that their creations can\n\nexperienced as intended by their public.\n Solutions will have to be radical, but not in the traditional sense.\n It is important to realize that, in terms of the end user, the best\n\nWeb content these days is designed rather that 'programmed'.\n If one understands this difference, one can see how primitive current\n\nWeb design tools actually are. \n\n  However, designers and artists are not the only people creating\n\ncontent for the Web.\n It should be noted that the Web is a highly powerful tool in the\n\nscientific and academic community.\n There, the considerations of textual structure are the first\n\npriority.\n Furthermore, Web content creation should be accessable to those with\n\nminimal computer literacy.\n The popularity of the Web can be at least partly attributed to the\n\neasy in which the average person can learn and use HTML.\n Therefore, a language should be available that does not require\n\nextensive understanding of computers or the working of the Internet.\n\n  In answering the demands of the these, often disparate camps of\n\ncontent creators, I have outlined some preliminary ideas for a new 'meta-lan 'mage'\n\nfor the World Wide Web.\n This new language would in itself provide few additional functions,\n\nbut rather offer an umbrella under which the present language tools could\n\nwork cooperatively, establishing certain norms ( keywords) through which\n\nlanguage components could interact.\n I wish only to suggest guidelines for constructing a meta-language -\n\n- principles which should guide any implementation.\n The details of a meta-language specification are beyond the scope of\n\nthis initial proposal. \n\n\n  To understand the limitations of HTML, it is important to first\n\nunderstand its central principle: markup.\n Markup is a codified way of delineating the structure of a text\n\ndocument, in such a way that it can be displayed reasonably across a variety\n\nof platforms.\n Its first considerations are: \" what information is important?\"\n and \" what are the structural relationships?\".\n Once this is 'marked', 'mhe browser software is left to decide how\n\nbest to display the document onscreen.\n The great majority of functions available in HTML are geared to these\n\nstructural considerations.\n Because of this, HTML is inherently text-dependent.\n This means, from the designer 's point of view, he or she must first\n\nconfront the text; its quantitative and structural qualities.\n Images, or other non-text material are almost always the second\n\npriority - - an afterthought.\n To add multimedia, the Web-designer must inevitably rely on various\n\ntricks and improvisations, only to be then unsure of how the final product\n\nwill appear to the end user.\n If this is compared with television or print media, one sees that it\n\nis an unacceptable situation.\n Take the example of television news, which increasingly use Web-style\n\ninformational presentation.\n The combination of multimedia with text based visuals is essential to\n\ntheir presentation - - images and text are, at least in design, on equal\n\nfooting.\n And even though the variety of television receivers is wide, the\n\nproducer can always be sure that his or her information will be reproduced in\n\ntact, barring physical defects in the receiver itself, and broadcast\n\nartifacts.\n This is because television has the advantage of uniformly adopted\n\nindustry standards, on which designers can rely.\n One such standard is NTSC video, which despite its significant\n\nshortcomings, provides a fixed pixel area ( 645x486), guaranteeing proper\n\nimage proportion on every set.\n While this may seem trivial, it does assure the content designer that\n\nhis product can be similarly reproduced by a variety of receivers.\n This gives the television designer a kind of creative flexibility not\n\navailable to the Web-designer ( yet).\n It 's also no secret that television exceeds the Web in popularity and\n\nsocial influence.\n The Web can do this and much more if those who create content have\n\nthe tools that allow their creativity to flourish.\n While this will eventually be accomplished by software in which the\n\nunderlying code is transparent to the user, the first step is to have the\n\ncode resources in place which embody the principles necessary for the\n\nmultimedia Web to gel. \n\n\n  Every successive HTML spec has included more multimedia\n\nfunctionality.\n This will no doubt continue.\n But, the problem of the media/text schism remains if multimedia is\n\naddressed through HTML alone.\n There, multimedia is treated as an extraneous 'element' - - a\n\nseparate entity from the text.\n While in HTML thorough consideration has been given for textual\n\nstructure, no 'markup 'msystems exist for multimedia.\n No language is available that considers text and non-text material as\n\ntheoretically equal.\n For example, in HTML it is easy to describe the title and important\n\nsubjects in a text passage:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthis. </b> \n\n  This is simple enough, but how would you describe to a HTML\n\ninterpreter, \" take the red parts of image A and mix them selectively with\n\nthe white parts in image B only if the mouse is in the upper righthand corner\n\nof the screen\"?\n It is of course possible, but extremely inconvenient and error prone.\n\n\n\n  Part of the problem is that HTML instructions are given in a\n\nlinear fashion.\n and formats the text in\n\nthe specified way until is receives an end tag </tag> .\n There are exceptions to this, but the core of HTML thinking remains\n\nbased on linear code interpretation.\n However, multimedia often doesn't fit this linear model.\n It may seem that video and music are simple progressions from\n\nbeginning to end - - in the old paradigm this is certainly the case.\n But the Web is, or should be, interactive.\n The Web allows for interactive multimedia on a scale never before\n\nthought of.\n It is the Web 's single most attractive feature.\n Just as hypertext changed the way a reader experiences text, Web\n\nmultimedia will alter time-based notions such as plot and timing beyond\n\nrecognition.\n A language which proceeds from a linear viewpoint will never allow\n\nmultimedia to reach this goal.\n Without multimedia, the Web will remain largely the toy of a vertical\n\nmarket. \n\n  Artistic creation rarely follows a clear line.\n For the artist/designer HTML with its linear nature is a considerable\n\nimpediment.\n It forces the artist to create a visual object ( the page) in a\n\nlinear manner : \" ok, we have blue text until here, then a GIF 100x150\n\npixels, then back to text, and that word should be in italics.\"\n Even though one might create parts of a page in a non-linear way, one\n\nsees from the example that the smallest building blocks are lines ,\n\ninterpreted from left to right.\n A painter would think, \" a house is in the foreground, the sun is\n\nabove it to the left\".\n Or better yet, \" the moving clouds cause the color of the light on\n\nthe house to change\".\n For him it is mostly unimportant which part of the image is seen\n\nfirst by the viewer.\n In this way, the painting is non-linear.\n The painter can work this way not only because of his tools, but the\n\nidea behind the tools.\n The simple analogy of brush-paint-canvas is based on the principle\n\nthat ideas are created and perceived non-linearly.\n That means that the painter is not constrained when choosing a color,\n\nand may freely choose any spot on the canvas on which to paint.\n Everything is 'random-access'.\n This a model that should emulated when constructing a language for\n\nthe multimedia Web. \n\n\n  So, we have seen that there are ( at least) two fundamental steps\n\nin current Web-design practice: 1) understand the nature of the text\n\nmaterial, and then 2) 'attach' images and multimedia.\n This schism comes from text-oriented style of HTML, and is\n\nessentially harmful to the creative process.\n Creativity thrives under flexibility.\n Art is at its most effective when the artist proceeds from a 'total\n\npicture'.\n The Web-designer today finds it difficult to get a 'total picture'\n\nbecause they are busying themselves with understanding the textual structure\n\nof individual documents, when their time could be more fruitfully spent\n\nconstructing the Web site as a unified whole.\n Understanding the content is the job of the content creator not the\n\nWeb designer.\n Very often today these roles are played by the same person.\n Returning to television again, one finds there a very clear division\n\nbetween the creator of the content and those charged to give it form.\n This is perhaps due to television 's relative maturity as a medium.\n\n\n\n  Concerns over content presentation are the subject of a ongoing\n\nand often bitter discussion on USENET groups.\n Discussion has usually degenerated into political sparring between\n\ntwo camps, the 'programmer' and the 'des 'dner'.\n Due to this, comprehensive solutions have not been forthcoming.\n We have fragmentary stopgap measures instead.\n A considerable impediment in this area has been the concern over\n\ninteroperability.\n Often those in the 'programmer' camp have maintained that full\n\ncontrol of multimedia and presentation would limit the available target\n\nplatforms.\n Working with today 's tools, this is a almost certainly a true\n\nassertion.\n For example, I have often wanted to take advantage of Shockwave or\n\nQuickTime VR, but have always been held back by my doubts over the\n\npenetration of those technologies.\n Ideally, available tools should have near 100% coverage.\n Today, the only possibilities are plug-ins and browser specific\n\nenhancements. \n\n  Plug-ins are inherently unreliable.\n First, they depend on the user 's awareness of its existence.\n This situation has been partially addressed by some browsers, where\n\none receives the message \" this page contains media type xxx/xxx which can\n\nonly be viewed with the appropriate plug-in. .. \" , then one can choose to\n\ndownload the plug-in or view the page without it.\n This often involves a lengthy download, then time to install the\n\nplug-in, a process which can often include downloading still more components\n\n- - it is far from a direct process, so much so that one often forgets the\n\npage that needed the plug-in in the first place.\n And even once the plug-in is installed, the designer cannot be\n\nassured that the plug-in will be properly installed and configured ( VRML\n\nplug-ins leap to mind here).\n As an architecture, plug-ins are naturally attractive; they have\n\nbeen successful in a range of other software environments where\n\ninteroperability is not mission-critical.\n But plug-ins do not meet the needs of creative Web-design, or\n\ndynamic content delivery, as their distribution model cannot provide a\n\nreasonable installed base guarantee.\n I do not mean to condemn plug-ins outright; in certain applications\n\nsuch as intranets, they provide an ideal solution.\n In this transition period, plug-in architecture has allowed a great\n\ndeal of healthy experimentation.\n But if we think in terms of a Internet-wide solution scalable with\n\nincreasing multimedia saturation, the weaknesses of plug-ins become evident.\n\n\n\n  Also, while not exactly plug-ins, platform independent\n\nclient-side scripting languages such as Java/JavaScript and Active X can be\n\nincluded here.\n The addition of client-side scripting has been a powerful addition\n\nto the designer/programmers toolset.\n However, client-side scripting shares the plug-in problem because it\n\nis dependent on class-libraries which often suffer from poor and inconsistent\n\nimplementation.\n This situation could no doubt improve in time; until there were true 'standard\n\nlibraries', such as we have with the conventional object oriented languages.\n But to do this would mean compromising platform portability, since\n\nthe libraries are client-side, they make calls to functions of the user 's own\n\nmachine.\n Of course, class-libraries are ported along with the browser for\n\ndifferent platforms, but seen as a whole, the resulting libraries are so\n\ninconsistent that they cannot be really suitable for platform-independent\n\napplications.\n For simple functions this is not necessarily a problem.\n Simple data types, small data sets and calculations can all be\n\nexpected to function with reasonable consistency across different client-side\n\nimplementations.\n But the future of the Web is multimedia.\n The more diverse the mix of media is within the browser space, the\n\nmore difficult it becomes to control within the framework of the current\n\nclient-side scripting languages.\n Multimedia will be a vital concern when ( and if) push-media reaches\n\ncritical mass.\n With that kind of diversity, the inherent limitations of\n\nclass-library implementations will be unworkable.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0fec8668-dfd3-4a72-91ab-4b92e6d801f2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.676387+00:00"}
{"text": "How to make \" calaveras\" or Mexican sugar skulls ( Copyright\n\n2011)\n\n  The net is an incredible place, because 10 years ago, if I wanted\n\nto make \" calaveras,\" which are those sugar skulls that kids and lovers give\n\neach other for the Mexican holiday El Dia de los Muertos ( the Day of the\n\nDead), how on earth would I have figured out how to do that without going to\n\nMexico and hanging out in some grandma 's kitchen?\n So I was all excited a couple of weeks back when I ordered my sugar\n\nskull mold ( just a cheap piece of polystyrene that looks like the containers\n\nthat things like Ipods and flash drives come in...that stuff thats\n\npractically impossible to cut open without slicing your hands) and got ready\n\nto make 40 calaveras for my fall dinner party. \n\n  The website that sold me the skull mold ( for an astonishing\n\n&dollar;15 considering the cheap production cost...this stuff is just basically\n\npackaging) has a recipe for sugar skulls that I found repeated virtually\n\nEVERYWHERE on the internet.\n If a site had a recipe for sugar skulls, this was the recipe.\n And there simply were no other recipes.\n The problem was that their recipe called for an ingredient called \"\n\nmeringue powder\" which is an obscure ingredient typically only found in\n\ncommercial kitchens, and it 's offensively expensive.\n Sure, their website will be happy to sell you a small quantity, enough\n\nto make about 4 big skulls, for around\n\n&dollar;10.  Maybe that 's a bargain if you only want to make 4 skulls ( which,\n\nwith your\n\n&dollar;15 mold and\n\n&dollar;10 meringue powder, plus shipping, is going to make your skulls cost around\n\n&dollar;9-&dollar;10 per skull once you buy the rest of the ingredients).\n\n\n  But their recipe specifically states, \" This recipe will not work\n\nif you leave out the meringue powder, the skulls will fall apart.\" And it was\n\nthe ONLY recipe I could find on the net that looked legitimate.\n \" Surely,\" I thought, \" those little grandmas in Oaxaca aren't\n\npulling out their tin of ultra-expensive imported meringue powder when it 's\n\ntime to make calaveras.\" Knowing that meringue powder is basically powdered\n\neggs whites, I figured...why not just try using egg whites to help cement the\n\nsugar together, and maybe bake the skulls at a low temperature to speed the\n\nsetting and drying process?\"\n An experiment proceeded to unfold.\n And I got it right with the first try!\n So if you can find yourself a sugar skull mold, here 's how to make\n\nperfect calaveras without meringue powder: 6 cups sugar, 2 egg whites. \n\n \n\n  Put the egg whites in the bottom of a big bowl, dump in the\n\ngranulated sugar, and get your hands all messy squeezing and churning it\n\ntogether until the sugar feels like wet sand at the beach.\n You want the sugar to be as dry as possible but still stick together\n\nin the mold, but it 's better for it to be too damp than too dry. \n\n  Take a handful, dump it into your skull mold and press it down,\n\nand continue until the mold is full.\n Make certain that you press VERY firmly so the sugar is packed hard\n\ninto the skull. \n\n  Then rake a knife or straight edge across the back of the mold to\n\ngive yourself a flat edge for the bottom of the skull. \n\n  Then take a spoon and scoop out a little sugar from the center of\n\nthe back of the skull so that you don't waste sugar and so the skull doesn't\n\nweigh too much. \n\n  Make sure the walls of the skull will be at least 1\" thick when\n\nyou dump it out of the mold, or it may collapse on itself. \n\n  Then take a square of cardboard just a little larger than your\n\nskull, place it against the back of the mold, and flip the mold over. \n\n  Gently pull the mold up off the sugar and you'll ha 'lla perfect\n\nreplica of a skull staring back at you. \n\n  The mold should come off easily.\n If it is hard to pull off, your sugar is too wet and you need to add\n\nan extra handful to the bowl and work it in well with your hands.\n The mold should pull off easily leaving a smooth, perfect replica,\n\nand the drier the sugar is, the better this will happen. \n\n  Rinse the mold between each skull and dry with a paper towel.\n Continue making skulls with more sugar and more cardboard squares\n\nuntil you have all your skulls formed.\n Then, very carefully, place your skulls inside a preheated 200F oven\n\nfor 30 minutes.\n When you remove them, the surface will be very hard to the touch.\n But don't put too much stress on them yet...they need a week of\n\ndrying before they'll be 'llrd enough all the way through to handle\n\nvigorously. \n\n  Google images for \" sugar skulls\" or \" calaveras\" to see pictures\n\nof how the skulls are decorated.\n Traditionally, the name of the person receiving the skull is written\n\non a piece of colored foil which is placed across the skull 's forehead, and\n\nthen the rest of the skull is decorated with brightly colored icing.\n You can get tubes of premixed icing at the grocery store which work\n\njust fine, or make your own by using lots of powdered sugar, an egg white, a\n\nfew tablespoons of corn starch, food coloring, and a few drops of water.\n Stir it until it 's thick, then stuff it into a decorating bag.\n If you don't have a decorating bag, make a cone of wax paper,\n\nparchment paper, or just plain paper, fill the cone with icing, and cut a\n\ntiny bit off the tip of the cone.\n Fold the top paper down until you can squeeze the icing out of the\n\ntip you just cut.\n Use the icing to decorate the skulls, which can be done as soon as\n\nthey come out of the oven and cool.\n Then let the skulls, icing and all, dry for a week and you'll 'lle a\n\nperfect Mexican sugar skull. \n\n  The recipe above will make about 2 complete large skulls.\n ( Molds come with a front and a back.\n You make them separately and then glue them together with icing.\n I found it was just as cool to just make the front of the skull, the\n\nface, and decorate it so it lies flat on the table and stares up at you.) So\n\nthe recipe above will make 3-4 large skull faces, but this will vary\n\ndepending on the size of your mold.\n If you make lots of skulls, buy a huge bag of sugar and lots of eggs.\n I went through 25 pounds of sugar and 18 eggs to make 40 skulls, and\n\nonly made the front half of the skull.  \n\n\n\n\n  Meditation is a mental discipline by which one attempts to get\n\nbeyond the conditioned, \" thinking\" mind into a deeper state of relaxation or\n\nawareness.\n\n\n  At the core of meditation is the goal to focus and eventually\n\nquiet your mind.\n As you progress, you will find that you can meditate anywhere and at\n\nany time, accessing an inner calm no matter what 's going on around you.\n You will also find that you can better control your reactions to\n\nthings as you become increasingly aware of your thoughts ( letting go of\n\nanger, for example).\n\n\n  1. Make time to meditate.\n Set aside enough time in your daily routine for meditating.\n The effects of meditation are most noticeable when you do it\n\nregularly and consistently rather than sporadically. \n\n  Some people will find a five minute meditation worthwhile, for\n\nothers, the benefits of longer meditation are well worth the time. \n\n  You can meditate at any time of day; some people like to start\n\ntheir day off with meditation, others like to end the day by clearing their\n\nmind, and some prefer to find refuge in meditation in the middle of a busy\n\nday.\n Generally, however, the easiest time to meditate is in the morning,\n\nbefore the day tires your body out and gives your mind more to think about.\n\n\n\n  Don't meditate immediately following a meal, or when you are\n\nlikely to be hungry.\n\n\n  Find or create a quiet, relaxing environment.\n It 's especially important, when you' 'restarting out, to avoid any\n\nobstacles to attention.\n Turn off any TV sets, phone(s) or other noisy appliances.\n If you play music, make sure it 's calm, repetitive and gentle, so as\n\nnot to break your concentration.\n Meditating outside can be conducive, as long as you don't sit near a\n\nbusy roadway or another source of loud noise. \n\n  Sit on level ground.\n Sit on a cushion if the ground is uncomfortable.\n You don't have to twist your limbs into the lotus position or adopt\n\nany unusual postures.\n The important thing is to keep your back straight, as this will help\n\nwith breathing later on. \n\n  Tilt your pelvis forward by sitting on the forward edge of a\n\nthick cushion, or on a chair that has its back legs lifted off the ground 8\n\nto 10 cm ( 3 or 4 inches). \n\n  Starting from your bottom, stack up the vertebrae in your spine,\n\nso that they are balanced one on top of another and support the whole weight\n\nof your torso, neck, and head.\n Done correctly, it feels as if no effort is required to hold your\n\ntorso up.\n ( A small amount of effort is in fact required, but with the right\n\nposture, it is so small and evenly distributed you don't notice it.) \n\n  Relax your arms and legs.\n They don't need to be in any special position, just as long as they\n\nare relaxed and don't interfere with balancing your torso.\n You can put your hands on your thighs, but it might be easier at\n\nfirst to let your arms hang at your sides - the hanging weight helps reveal\n\nwhere things are out of alignment. \n\n  Relax everything, and keep searching for things that aren't\n\nrelaxed.\n When you find them, ( and you will), relax them.\n You may find that you can't relax them unless you adjust your posture\n\nso that you are better aligned, and that place doesn't need to work anymore.\n This commonly happens with muscles near your spine.\n You may also notice that you are twisted a little and need to\n\nstraighten out.\n\n\n  Let your attention rest on the flow of your breath.\n Listen to it, follow it, but make no judgments on it ( such as \" It\n\nsounds a little raspy...maybe I' 'mgetting a cold?\").\n The goal is to allow the \" chattering\" in your mind to gradually fade\n\naway.\n\n\n  Try reciting a mantra ( repetition of a sacred word) or short\n\nBible verse.\n A single word like \" aum\" uttered at a steady rhythm is best.\n You can recite it verbally or just with the voice in your mind.\n Beginners may find it easier to count their breaths.\n Try counting your breath from 1 to 10, then simply start again at 1.\n\n\n\n  To circumvent images that keep intruding on your thoughts,\n\nvisualize a place that calms you.\n It can be real or imaginary.\n Imagine you are at the top of a staircase leading to a peaceful\n\nplace.\n Count your way down the steps until you are peaceful and relaxed.\n\n\n\n  Silence your mind. Once you 've trained your mind to focus on just\n\none thing at a time, the next step is focus on nothing at all, essentially \"\n\nclearing\" your mind.\n This requires tremendous discipline but is the pinnacle of\n\nmeditation.\n After focusing on a single point as described in the previous step,\n\nyou can either cast it away, or observe it impartially and let it come and\n\nthen go, without labeling it as \" good\" or \" bad\".\n Take the same approach to any thoughts which return to your mind\n\nuntil silence perseveres. \n\n  For some people, focusing attention on a point or object does\n\nexactly the opposite of what meditation is all about.\n It takes you back to the life of focus, concentration, strain.\n In this case, as an alternative to the above techniques, some\n\nmeditators recommend un-focusing your attention.\n Instead of focusing attention on a point or an object, this type of\n\nmeditation is achieved by attaining a state of zero.\n Take your attention above all thoughts to a point where you lose all\n\nattention and all thoughts. \n\n  What you do with a silent mind is up to you.\n Some people find that it is a good time to introduce an intention or\n\na desired outcome to the subconscious mind.\n Others prefer to \" rest\" in the rare silence that meditation\n\naffords. \n\n  You should be comfortable enough to concentrate, but not so\n\ncomfortable that you feel the urge to fall asleep. \n\n  Make some effort to be mindful of your mood and thoughts when\n\nnot meditating.\n You may notice that you feel calmer, happier, and sharper on days\n\nwhen you have meditated, and notice a decrease in these qualities when you\n\nhave not.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c34bca4a-0588-4a2b-8432-d4bc477682d4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.677783+00:00"}

the  \u001creal\u001d folks turned\n\noff the light and left the room.\n The dolls--Beloved Belindy, the French doll, Uncle Clem, and\n\nothers--were owned and cared for by Marcella ( white girl, low curls),4 who\n\ntalked to them but could not hear them.\n Into her own wagon Marcella lined up her dolls and pulled them around\n\nthe house, the conductor of a special train.\n She did all this between the pages of the big black book owned by the\n\nchild with brown hair, brown eyes.\n\n  One day the child was lonely.\n So she lined up her dolls in her own wagon ( wobbly wheels, rusty\n\nhandle): a panda bear, Ruthie, a ragged pink bunny, Smokey the Bear, Barbie\n\nwith a bubble-cut hairdo heavy that it cracked her neck and made her head\n\nfall off.\n The girl pretended she was Marcella, trailing her train behind her up\n\nthe driveway, around the house, pointing out scenic spots and collecting\n\ntickets as a good conductor does.\n At that moment the child became Marcella.\n In a moment of transference(transformation? transcendence?), the\n\nedges blurred and she became what she read.\n\n  \u001c[N]othing less than our sanity and survival is at\n\nstake in the

Cooper, district superintendent.\n \" The program is working.\"\n There are other good examples in Western New York of schools trying\n\nto help students overcome the problems that come between them and\n\nlearning.\n\n  The Buffalo school system has anti-drug counselors at some high\n\nschools, runs a school for unwed mothers and runs training courses in\n\nconflict resolution for students and teachers.\n\n  The Williamsville Central School District has an alternative high\n\nschool that provides individual attention for students who have academic,\n\ndisciplinary or adjustment problems.\n\n  But more needs to be done to deal with the personal troubles of\n\ntroubled students.\n\n  The state report offers one possible answer.\n At the least, it should cause a search for other ways to help\n\nstudents who too often end up on unemployment lines, as high school drop-outs\n\nor as victims of the cycle of poverty and abuse.\n\n \n\n SEVERAL local\n\ngovernments in recent years have removed engineering qualifications from\n\ntop-level jobs in the public works field.\n\n\n  The notion seems to be that people with some sort of\n\nadministrative ability can handle the jobs without having the technical\n\nbackground.\n But the public would be better served if the people heading\n\ngovernmental units concerned with buildings, roads, bridges and pipes had\n\nengineering training and experience.\n How can they command others in the field if they lack the technical\n\nknowledge and don't know the language of the trade?\n How can they make the proper judgments about safety?\n How can they keep from being fooled?\n Some examples: In 1988, Buffalo juggled the City Charter\n\nqualifications for the job of commissioner of public works so that David P.\n\nComerford, a non-engineer and a political ally of Mayor Griffin 's, could be\n\nappointed.\n Previously, the appointee had to be an engineer.\n Now, as administrations change, the Erie-Niagara Chapter of the State\n\nSociety of Professional Engineers is urging that a professional engineer be\n\nappointed by Mayor-elect Anthony M. Masiello.\n Sure, the society is following its own self-interest, but that\n\ndoesn't keep it from being right.\n While the Charter doesn't require an engineer, it doesn't prohibit\n\none from being appointed.\n\n\n  In September, the Buffalo Sewer Authority, controlled by Griffin,\n\ndumped its time-tested requirement that its top staff job, general manager,\n\nbe held by an engineer.\n Comerford was duly appointed, probably making it possible for him to\n\nsurvive the change in administrations for a time.\n\n\n  In February, the Niagara Falls City Council dropped engineering\n\nrequirements for public works director, and Dick Lucinski, a local television\n\nreporter, was named.\n There is now a Council resolution to restore the qualifications.\n It is spearheaded by a Democrat opposed to Republican Mayor Jacob A.\n\nPalillo, but, politics aside, the resolution is right.\n It says that knowledge of such things as concrete mixes, soil\n\nbearings and reinforcing steel strengths is important for a public works\n\nchief.\n Sometimes it 's a matter of public safety.\n Top public-works jobs should be filled by professionals in the field.\n To properly command their departments, they should be familiar by\n\neducation and experience with a range of technical matters that escape\n\nuntrained mortals.\n For instance, they should be able to discourse about tensile strength\n\nwithout fumbling for a manual.\n\n\n\n\n  LEADERS AT THE State University of New York and its flagship\n\nBuffalo campus have a problem.\n They have watched the system that is supposed to prepare the state 's\n\nwork force get squeezed by years of budget cuts, sapping much of its\n\nvitality.\n\n  Yet they can't scream too loudly for fear of scaring away\n\nstudents and faculty.\n\n  That leaves it up to state officials to recognize on their own\n\nthe importance of the SUNY system, and particularly the university centers\n\nlike UB.\n And it leaves it up to residents to demand that higher education not\n\nbe treated like an ugly stepchild in the state budget each year.\n\n  SUNY has lost 9 percent of its faculty, 5 percent of its student\n\nenrollment and has eliminated 3,000 classes since 1987-88.\n That is hardly the way to maintain a first-rate public university\n\nsystem.\n\n  When students can't get the classes they want, have to sit in\n\novercrowded lecture halls or take five years to graduate, SUNY is on its way\n\ndown hill.\n\n  Nor is UB immune to the problems affecting the rest of the\n\nsystem.\n Hampered by union rules that restrict the ability to manage personnel\n\nand by a budget structure that makes no allowance for negotiated salary\n\nincreases, UB officials say the campus has lost\n\n&dollar; 28 million in real spending power since 1987-88, when inflation and the\n\nsalary hikes are factored in.\n\n\n  The problems are the same on other campuses, a fact illustrated\n\nin an alarming Newsday series that took an in-depth look at SUNY 's many\n\nproblems last year.\n The 1994 budget will provide another for state officials to prove\n\nthat the promises made in the wake of that expose were more than just\n\nrhetoric.\n\n  SUNY officials are seeking a\n\n&dollar; 1.5 billion budget, up 8 percent.\n That request comes at the same time that Cuomo has asked all\n\ndepartments to come in with budgets 2 percent lower than needed simply to\n\nhold the line.\n\n  That sets the stage for one more showdown that will illustrate\n\njust how well - - or how poorly - - Albany understands the role that higher\n\neducation plays in the economic and cultural life of a state.\n\n  The SUNY request includes\n\n&dollar; 10 million for graduate research facilities plus\n\n&dollar; 5 million for auxiliary personnel and supplies necessary to attract\n\ntop-flight researchers - - and the outside grants they bring - - to SUNY.\n Given that every dollar spent on graduate research attracts\n\n&dollar; 3.50 in outside funding, that seems a smart investment.\n\n  But thinking in terms of education as an investment takes a\n\nforesight not always evident in Albany.\n UB officials - - who would get an extra\n\n&dollar;13 million under the SUNY request, and about 40 percent of the research\n\nmoney - - say they just want the state to stop the bleeding.\n\n  Considering that no will exists to raise tuition in an election\n\nyear, SUNY is at the mercy of state officials if its programs aren't to be\n\ngutted further.\n The budget to be unveiled next month by Cuomo and approved by the\n\nLegislature must recognize that public higher education can't take more\n\nhits.\n LAME DUCKS HEADED SOUTH AMOS, WOYSHNER TOOK TAXPAYERS FOR A\n\nRIDE\n\n  PUBLIC officials - - like everyone else - - can get in a rut.\n Ways of doing business can become so habitual that change is not\n\nonly difficult but hard to envision.\n\n\n  So it 's a good idea for public officials to go - - from time to\n\ntime - - to state and national conferances about governmental issues.\n If they go with an open mind, putting business ahead of the\n\ninevitable tourist attractions, they will return home with fresh ideas and a\n\nbroader outlook worth the cost of the trip.\n\n  But what were two area lame ducks up to when they headed to the\n\nannual conference of the National League of Cities in Orlando, Fla., at\n\ntaxpayer expense, a few weeks before the curtain falls on their tenure in\n\npublic office?\n Archie L. Amos Jr. took the trip even though he lost his University\n\nDistrict seat on the Buffalo Common Council when he was relegated to an\n\nindependent line after pleading guilty to a fraud charge in connection with\n\nhis nominating petitions.\n\n  Leonard Woyshner took the trip even though voters last month\n\nended his 20-year tenure as the 3rd Ward 's representative on the Lackawanna\n\nCity Council.\n\n  Whatever the two may have learned in Orlando cannot be\n\ntranslated into a better performance as public officials because they won't\n\nbe public officials after Jan. 1.\n Any added know-how they may have picked up in Orlando will do no\n\ngood to the taxpayers who paid the bill.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ba71be17-5741-4b82-b1e2-b12bb55c2a4e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.680369+00:00"}
{"text": "Federal budget cuts may slash everything from supercomputers to atom\n\nsmashers.\n Will they imperil U.S.science?\n\n\n  In the waning days of World War II, two weapons conceived,\n\ndesigned, and constructed by physicists shattered any doubts about the power\n\nof science to change the world.\n They were, of course, the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and\n\nNagasaki.\n Even before then, the development of radar and the like meant that\n\npoliticians could no longer dismiss scientists as aloof polymaths engaged in\n\nesoteric pursuits.\n Since World War II, science is power.\n Numerous government-sponsored national laboratories have sprung up,\n\nmainly to produce more advanced atomic and hydrogen weapons.\n\n  Science now means economic prowess too.\n \" On the wisdom with which we bring science to bear in the war\n\nagainst disease, in the creation of new industries, and in the strengthening\n\nof our armed forces depends...our future as a nation,\" science adviser\n\nVannevar Bush argued in his 1945 treatise \" The Endless Frontier\" His report\n\nled to the formation of the National Science Foundation in 1950 and paved the\n\nway for the glory days of science.\n In the following decades, the National Institutes of Health, NASA,\n\nthe Department of Energy, and other research-intensive organizations were\n\nestablished.\n Federal agencies currently lavish\n\n&dollar;34 billion annually on civilian R&D - and pay for the majority of basic\n\nresearch done at universities.\n\n  Today, science stands at a crossroads.\n led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republicans in Congress propose\n\nthe largest cutback in science and technology spending in 15 years.\n The recent House of Representatives budget resolution promises an\n\neffective 25 to 30 percent cut in civilian science over the next 7 years,\n\nassuming 3 percent inflation.\n\n\n  Under the House plan, funding for supercomputers, environmental\n\nsatellites, solar energy, and fusion power would all be drastically\n\ncurtailed.\n The Energy and Commerce departments, both of which spend billions on\n\nresearch, would be abolished.\n Basic sciences such as physics and chemistry would fare better, but\n\nagencies like the National Institutes of Health still face the possibility of\n\na 7-year budget freeze.\n\n  The plans have scientists in an uproar.\n \" In the United States we've built up this unbelievable 've machine,\n\nand we're on the verge of destroyi 'reit, not out of maliciousness but out of\n\na desire to solve the budget problem,\" NASA administrator Dan Goldin -\n\nhimself a cost-cutter-warned in a speech.\n \" It scares the hell out of me. \"\n Republicans, of course, argue that their plan is needed to balance\n\nthe budget, and say their cuts mostly target bloated \" pork-barrel\"\n\ntechnology projects while protecting basic research.\n\n  The budget battle is just beginning: A final budget probably\n\nwon't be set until October.\n\n  To get the bottom line on the budget, POPUlAR SCIENCE interviewed\n\ntwo of the leading science experts in Congress: Robert Walker of\n\nPennsylvania, the new Republican chairman of the House Science Committee; and\n\nRepresentative George Brown, former chair of the same committee and Walker 's\n\nchief nemesis.\n\n \n\n  PS: What 's your philosophy of government science funding?\n What kind of research should the government pay for, and what should\n\nit avoid?\n\n  REP.WALKER: I come down heavily on the side of funding basic\n\nuniversity research.\n The government ought to sponsor basic research that no one else would\n\nbe willing to undertake.\n Secondarily, I support programs only government can do with its kind\n\nof financial resources - the space program being a prime example.\n\n  But I don't think the government should be involved in\n\ndevelopmental work.\n That is, research involving businesses that have a particular product\n\nin mind.\n\n\n  Now if doing basic research leads to some applications, then the\n\ngovernment has some role.\n The human genome project is a good example.\n As we do fundamental research on the human genome, we discover\n\nbiomedical applications.\n It 's fine for the government to fund some of these.\n But the underlying force behind the program ought to be basic\n\nscience.\n\n  PS: How do you draw the line between basic research and\n\ndevelopmental work?\n\n  REP.WALKER: There is no firm line.\n But if you're setting up programs t 're have a very quick payoff, my\n\nguess is those have little to do with basic science.\n\n  The advanced technology program at the Commerce Department is a\n\nprime example.\n This program 's goal is for government to work with industry with the\n\nexpress intention of producing a new product.\n\n\n  I think technology develops so fast that it is beyond\n\ngovernment 's ability to respond.\n The marketplace is a far better judge of where technology investment\n\nshould go.\n\n \n\n  REP.WALKER: I think there are some areas we have underemphasized\n\nin the past that we ought to concentrate on.\n One of the first bills to come out of my committee was the Hydrogen\n\nFuture Act.\n Hydrogen seems to be a potential energy resource with benign\n\nenvironmental properties.\n\n \n\n  I'm also personally intere 'med in the so-called cold fusion area.\n It 's not fusion, obviously.\n But there 's something that 's producing additional heat, and it 's\n\nbeing found in laboratory after laboratory.\n No one at this point can explain it.\n The hydrogen bill sets aside some monies to go into highly innovative\n\nresearch such as this.\n\n  Now, let 's say that we do the hydrogen research and we find\n\napplications for hydrogen, but hydrogen is still not cost-effective compared\n\nwith other power sources.\n The government shouldn't continue supporting hydrogen simply because\n\nthere 's no market for it.\n\n  But this is what happens now at the Department of Energy.\n A number of renewable energy programs there are life-support systems.\n Like photovoltaics.\n The government is paying researchers to reproduce photovoltaic panels\n\nthat it has already done the research on over and over again.\n\n  PS: Take us several years into the future, and predict what the\n\nscience budget will look like.\n\n  REP.WALKER: At the turn of the century, the science budget will\n\nheavily emphasize basic research.\n We will have enhanced the ability of universities to do research by\n\nstabilizing government spending and by going to a permanent R&D tax credit.\n This not only will allow companies to deduct internal research from\n\ntheir taxes, but will encourage industry to collaborate with\n\nuniversities.\n\n  Overall, I would hope that by the year 2000, R&D becomes a much\n\ngreater share of the gross domestic product than it is now.\n\n  PS: So how much will the government spend on science in the year\n\n2000 under your plan?\n\n  REP.WALKER: Over the next 5 years, our plan spends\n\n&dollar;111 billion on civilian R&D, somewhat less than what we'd spend if we 'd\ncontinued at current levels.\n However, basic research is pretty well protected.\n\n\n  Where we take the hit is in corporate subsidies.\n In all honesty, I'm not willing to 'my that because people contribute\n\na lot of money to political campaigns, they ought to get money for projects\n\nthat they call \" science. \"\n That 's what I think happens in the Commerce Department 's Advanced\n\nTechnology Program.\n It 's a\n\n&dollar;600 million-a-year program, and our plan totally eliminates it.\n\n  Some of the energy programs are also hit.\n For instance, the conservation program at the Department of Energy\n\ngoes from a\n\n&dollar;3.2 billion-to a\n\n&dollar;2.2 billion-a-year program over 7 years.\n\n \n\n  REP.WALKER: NASA 's budget actually declines over the next seven\n\nyears, but it 's mostly the result of accepting the reforms promised by NASA\n\nadministrator Dan Goldin.\n\n  We also assume an aggressive privatization of the space shuttle.\n We want a private entity to take over the shuttle and launch those\n\nflights that NASA needs, and perhaps also launch the shuttle for profit a\n\ncouple of times a year.\n This will save\n\n&dollar;1.5 billion over 7 years.\n\n  The biggest difference between our NASA budget and the Clinton\n\nadministration 's budget is in the Earth Observing System.\n We cut\n\n&dollar;2.7 billion over 7 years from this [ environmental satellite] program.\n The savings come in three ways.\n First of all, we think some of the ground-based data collection is\n\npork barrel and can be cut back.\n Second, we believe that by taking advantage of micro-miniaturization,\n\nNASA can use much smaller satellites and save tremendous amounts of money.\n Finally, we think NASA can derive revenue by selling some of the data\n\nit gathers from its Earth Observing System satellites.\n\n  PSi is there any possibility that the space station will be\n\naxed?\n\n  REP.WALKER: No.\n I support the space station because it represents a major\n\ntechnological challenge for America.\n I predict that within a few years the NASA space station will produce\n\na Nobel Prize, simply because of the uniqueness of the environment there.\n\n  PS: If the Energy and Commerce departments get cut, as\n\nRepublicans propose, what will happen to the scientific functions performed\n\nby those agencies, like weather forecasting?\n\n  REP.WALKER: If you eliminate these departments, you need to find\n\na place for valuable agencies like the National Institute of Standards and\n\nTechnology and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [ both\n\nparts of the Commerce Department].\n\n  My own preference is to put together a Department of Science that\n\nwould pick up the pieces of the departments of Energy and Commerce.\n It would also include NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n\n  PS: MIT Nobel laureate David Baltimore argues that the budget\n\ncuts will mean that his most talented graduate students won't be able to find\n\njobs.\n He says the cuts \" threaten the very foundation of science in this\n\ncountry.\"\n\n\n  REP.WALKER: I think that 's a total misreading of everything\n\nwe're doin 're\n In fact, our plan will offer his students greater opportunities.\n Right now the opportunities have been diminishing in large part\n\nbecause Congress has funded too much pork-barrel science and not enough good,\n\nfundamental science.\n By changing the mix and getting a greater overall investment in\n\nscience, we will assure more science jobs.\n\n  PS: So your plan goes against the recent trend of concentrating\n\nmore on research that will have a quick economic payback?\n\n  REP.WALKER: I think that 's a very dangerous trend.\n The administration and others who have been moving the National\n\nScience Foundation away from basic research toward applied research are\n\nabsolutely wrong.\n It 's just one more example of science being used for political gain\n\nrather than achievement.\n\n  PS: We've re 'vehorror stories that the National Weather Service\n\nwon't be able to predict weather, or that the Centers for Disease Control\n\nwon't be able to track deadly diseases if your budget goes through.\n\n\n  REP.WALKER: I have seen a number of agencies screaming that if\n\nyou cut our money or freeze our budget, we are not going to be able to\n\nrespond to future needs of society.\n It 's the typical Washington game where as soon as you talk about\n\nreducing funds at the Interior Department, they say, \" Oh, my goodness, we'll\n\n'llhave to shut down the Washington Monument.\"\n\n  Yes, researchers and everybody else will have to prioritize.\n But I would point out that most R&D agencies got dramatic budget\n\nincreases during the 1980s.\n When we started the budget process, we decided that no science\n\nbudget by the end of the century should be below where it had been at the\n\nbeginning of this decade.\n\n\n \n\n  PS: How does your philosophy of government science funding\n\ndiffer from Robert Walker 's?\n\n  REP.BROWN: My differences with Mr.\n Walker involve the value of applied research or technology\n\ndevelopment.\n I give applied research the same degree of importance as basic\n\nresearch in terms of the future economic development of this country.\n Mr.\n Walker doesn't.\n He calls it corporate welfare and says that this is something that\n\nthe private sector should do.\n And in this he 's wrong.\n The private sector can't do it.\n They have no economic incentive to do long-term applied research or\n\ntechnology development.\n\n  Our international competitors do it, and that 's what is giving\n\nthem a competitive advantage over us.\n\n \n\n  REP.BROWN: If the Republican budget is passed in its present\n\nform, it will be destructive of America 's economic future and of the\n\nwell-being of our citizens.\n It will be impossible to sustain the rate of economic growth that\n\nthis country requires with the reduction in R&D investment that the\n\nRepublicans propose.\n\n  A decade ago, the United States was one of the top three\n\ncountries in government investment in R&D.\n We now rank about 20th, according to figures compiled by the\n\nEuropean community.\n This steep decline will get steeper if the Republican budget is\n\npassed.",

{"text": "IF HORSES HAD gods, said the Presocratic philosopher Xenophanes,\n\nthey would imagine them as horses, and similarly for cows.1 And likewise, one\n\nmight add, without the hypothetical qualification, for philosophers.\n Metaphysics\n\n 12, is made very much in the philosopher 's own image and likeness, for\n\nhe is pure thought.\n Aristotle 's philosopher-God not only outranks Plato 's\n\nphilosopher-king, he outphilosophizes  \u001c the philosopher,\u001d \n\nsince the sole object of his thought is thought, in other words, himself.\n His thinking, in Aristotle 's memorable if mysterious phrase, is a\n\nthinking of thinking.2\n\n  While Plato 's gods have as their specific function the care for\n\nall things (  Laws  900d), Aristotle 's God, totally absorbed in\n\nself-contemplation and remote from the world he did not create and may not\n\neven know,3 is clearly unconcerned about the fall of a sparrow.\n But if there is no room in the Aristotelian universe for a special\n\nprovidence, controlling the fate of individuals, there might nonetheless be a\n\ngeneral one which governs the eternal and regular motion of the heavenly\n\nspheres but does not influence the ephemeral and erratic movements of humans\n\nand sparrows in the sublunary realm.\n Or so it was generally believed around the second century A.D.4\n This account, which clearly developed from the Aristotelian\n\ndistinction between the perfect regularity of the heavens and the haphazard,\n\nunpredictable nature of sublunary events, was the version of Aristotle 's\n\nattitude towards divine providence which the Church Fathers knew and reacted\n\nagainst.5\n That most Aristotelian of Aristotelian commentators, Alexander of\n\nAphrodisias, presented a somewhat different view of divine providence, which\n\nhe considered to be more in line with his master 's philosophy.\n Attempting to find an acceptable middle ground between the Epicurean\n\nbelief that the gods were totally unconcerned with the world and the Stoic\n\nassertion that God took care of every humble detail in the universe,\n\nAlexander assigned the operation of providence to the sublunary realm.\n He maintained, however, that it was strictly limited to the influence\n\nof the regular motion of the heavenly bodies, which ensured the preservation\n\nand welfare of species, but played no rote whatever in the good or bad\n\nfortune ofindividuals.6\n The patristic and, to a lesser extent, the Alexandrist interpretation\n\nremained the standard versions of Aristotelian divine providence until the\n\nnineteenth century.\n\n Apparently, the original\n\ntranscription\u0014most likely containing Ancient Greek typography-- has been lost\n\nas a result of data being transferred from one word processing program to\n\nanother. This comment supplied by Darrell Penta, 2/8/09 usually known by\n\nits Latin title  De mundo  , is a brief cosmological,\n\nmeteorological, geographical, and theological treatise, attributed to\n\nAristotle and dedicated to his pupil Alexander the Great.\n It contains a number of Peripatetic doctrines, such as the\n\ntranscendence of God, who is an unmoved mover, and the division of the\n\nuniverse into a supralunary world composed of incorruptible ether and a\n\nsublunary realm made up of fire, air, water and earth.\n But the treatise also presents providence as pervasive throughout the\n\nentire universe and as affecting all entities within it, a view in conflict\n\nnot only with the self-absorption of the unmoved mover but also with the\n\nbelief in a circumscribed divine influence which the doxographical tradition,\n\nthe Church Fathers, and Alexander of Aphrodisias attributed to Aristotle.\n\n\n\u001cthe ordering and arrangement of all things, preserved by and through God\u001d\n\n ( 391b11-12) and states that  \u001cthe old explanation that we\n\nhave all inherited from our fathers is that all things are from God, and were\n\nframed by God, and no natural thing is of itself sufficient for itself,\n\ndeprived of the permanence which it derives from him\u001d  (\n\n397b13-16).7\n\n  De\n\nmundo  until the fifth century A.D., when Proclus, citing the work as\n\nevidence of Aristotle 's views, added the proviso  \u001c if the book \n\nDe mundo  is by him.\"8\n Unfortunately he gave no explanation for his uncertainty about its\n\nauthorship.\n The twelfth-century Jewish scholar Moses Maimonides was equally\n\nuninformative when he dismissed  The Book of the Golden House  ( the\n\ntitle given to the three Arabic translations of  De mundo  ) as\n\n \u001c idle talk\u001d  and said that it belonged  \" to those [\n\nworks] which had been attributed to Aristotle but are not by him.\"9\n Although the treatise was translated into Latin in the thirteenth\n\ncentury, it was not until the Renaissance that Western scholars began to\n\ndiscuss their reasons disbelieving or believing that  De mundo  was\n\ngenuine.\n Among the grounds they gave for doubting its authenticity were: the\n\nhighly rhetorical style, which seemed un-Aristotelian, as did its oratorical,\n\nas opposed to philos method; the apparently anachronistic references to\n\nBritain and Ceylon; and the preface, addressed to Alexander the Great, which\n\nwas, like the flattering reference to  \u001cthe worthy Plato\u001d  and\n\nthe quotation from his  Laws  , highly uncharacteristic.\n The most important reasons for regarding the work as authentic were\n\nthe ancient  testimonia  :\n Justin Martyr referred to an Aristotelian work that sounded like it\n\nin his  Cohortatio ad Graecos  ; Apuleius stated in the preface to\n\nhis  De mundo  ( in fact a paraphrase of the Greek treatise) that he\n\nwas following Aristotle and Theophrastus; Philoponus cited it twice as a work\n\nof Aristotle; and Stobaeus anthologized it in his  Eclogae  under\n\nthe heading:  \" From the Letter of Aristotle to\n\nAlexander.\"11\n\n  But there was another, and for many scholars more compelling,\n\nmotive for accepting the treatise as genuine.\n , who framed the world and was\n\nresponsible for the preservation of everything in it, seemed closer to\n\nChristian notions of divinity than the generally accepted interpretations of\n\nAristotle 's God, who had not created the world, whose providence extended\n\nonly to the moon and who did not concern himself with the individuals.\n Those who believed that Aristotelianism was essentially compatible\n\nwith Christianity were therefore inclined to support its authenticity.\n\n  Theologia platonica\n\n was to demonstrate that the Christian belief in the immorality of the\n\nsoul could be proven on the basis of reason, above all the reason embodied in\n\nPlatonic philosophy.\n But Ficino also drew on other ancient philosophical systems to make\n\nhis points, as for example in Book 2, Chapter 13, entitled  \u001cGod Loves\n\nand Provides,\u001d  where he cites  Metaphysics \n\n12.10.1075a11-15 to show that, according to Aristotle, just as the order of\n\nan army lies with its general, so the order universe as a whole lies with\n\nGod.12 Later in the same chapter, Ficino refers to an extended simile in \n\nDe Mundo  ( 398b16-22) in order to explain how God controls everything\n\nin the world like a puppeteer pulling strings.\n Here, in Ficino 's view, Aristotle firmly asserted the existence of\n\nprovidence, just as he had in  Physics  2.8-9, when be discussed the\n\nteleology of nature, and in  Nicomachean Ethics \n\n10.8.1179a24-30.14\n\n  In this latter passage, Aristotle gives the following argument to\n\ndemonstrate that the wise man is dearest to the gods:  \u001cif the gods\n\nhave any care for human affairs, as they are thought to have, it would be\n\nreasonable both that they should delight in that which was best and most akin\n\nto them ( i.e. intellect) and that they should reward those who love and\n\nhonour this most.\u001d  This view of divinity does not fit with the\n\nPeripatetic tradition that limited providence to the celestial spheres, much\n\nless with the first prime mover of  Metaphysics  12.\n It can perhaps best be explained as an example of Aristotle\n\naccommodating himself to the religion of his day.\n Another reference to the popular belief that God rewards good\n\nbehavior and punishes bad ( and hence is not responsible for mere chance\n\nevents) occurs in  Magna moralia  2.8.1207a6-11, where Aristotle\n\nasks:   \u001cCan good fortune...be a kind of divine providence\u001d\n This we cannot believe; for we look to God, as controlling good and\n\nevil things, to apportion them in accordance with desert; whereas fortune and\n\nits gifts are bestowed in very truth 'fortuitously'.\n If we attribute these gifts to God, we shall make him either an\n\nincompetent judge or an unjust one; and this is alien to his\n\nnature.\"\n Many Christian scholars saw in both these passages a positive\n\nattitude towards divine providence which appeared to be in line with that\n\npresented in  De mundo  .\n These texts were therefore frequently cited in conjunction with the\n\ntreatise by those who believed it to be authentic.\n\n  Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, for instance, in his treatise\n\nagainst divinatory astrology, alludes to both texts, along with Plato 's\n\nstatements about divine justice (  Laws  715e and 73oc) quoted in\n\n De mundo  ( 401624-29), a book he describes as  \u001ccertainly\n\nworthy of Aristotle 's wisdom.\u001d  He uses these quotations to maintain\n\nthat the philosopher had strongly affirmed his belief in a God directing us\n\nin all things.16 Pico 's nephew, Gianfrancesco, in his treatise on divine\n\nprovidence, makes the same point about Aristotle, likewise quoting support\n\n Magna moralia  2.8 and several passages from De mundo,  \u001ca\n\nbook certainly worthy of Aristotle 's wisdom, according to the testimony of my\n\nuncle Giovanni Pico.\"17\n\n  was not always an unmixed blessing for\n\nthose who sought to reconcile Aristotelianism and Christianity.\n (\n\n1469), attempted to refute the arguments by which George of Trebizond had, in\n\nhis view, made Aristotle into a Christian.\n One such argument, put forward by George in the second book of his\n\n Comparationes philosophorum Aristotelis et Platonis  , was that\n\nAristotle had believed that God created the world  ex nihilo \n\nbecause, according to his philosophy, both the heavens and nature were\n\ndependent on God.\n For Bessarion, however, this dependence did not mean, as George\n\nmaintained, that Aristotle 's God was the efficient cause of the world, but\n\nmerely its final cause.\n To emphasize the difference between Aristotelian and Christian\n\nnotions of divine  creatioti,Bessarion adduced Aristotle 's\n\nown words in  De mundo  ( 397b2o-3o), where he said that although\n\nGod is  \u001c the preserver and creator\u001d  of everything in the\n\nuniverse, he does not endure  \u001c the weariness of a being that\n\nadministers and labours\u001d  but acts by means of an indefatigable power\n\nwhich extends  \u001ceven over things which are far distant from him.\u001d\n\n Bessarion interpreted this to mean that Aristotle 's God, unlike the\n\nChristian one, was not the efficient cause of the universe, for he himself\n\nhad not directly created it, but had instead operated by means of a celestial\n\nforce which made, administered, governed and preserved everything.18\n\n  The awkward implications which Bessarion found in this passage\n\nwere conveniently ignored by those, such as Agostino Steuco, the scholarly\n\nbishop and Vatican librarian, who found in  De mundo  a mine of\n\nuseful material for establishing the fundamental harmony between pagan\n\nphilosophy and Christian theology.\n Steuco aimed to demonstrate\n\nhow close many ancient thinkers were to Christian ideas of monotheism, the\n\ncreation of the world, the immortality of the soul, and the existence of\n\ndivine providence.\n as proof that\n\nAristotle 's God governed not merely the motion of the heavens but also the\n\nentire world.19\n To justify his reliance on a work whose authenticity had been\n\nquestioned, Steuco cited Justin Martyr 's reference to it.20\n He also claimed that its genuineness was proved by the fact that\n\nAristotle had said many of the same things, albeit more obscurely, in his\n\nother works.\n\n\n\u001c the favor of heaven bestowed especial honor upon the generation of the\n\npious\u001d  ( 4ooa34-b1).\n\n\n1o.8, where Aristotle says that the man who exercises and cultivates his\n\nintellect is most favored by God.21\n\n  Muzio Pansa borrowed this comparison of texts, along with much\n\nelse, from Steuco, and put it in his  De osculo ethnicae et Christianae\n\nphilosophiae  a similar attempt to show the agreement of pagan and\n\nChristian ideas, in which both passages are cited as proof of Aristotle 's\n\nbelief in divine providence.22\n to corroborate his theory that\n\nthe reason why Chaldaean, Egyptian, Arabic, Greek, and Roman philosophies\n\nwere so close to Christianity was that they all derived ultimately from\n\nHebrew doctrines.\n Aristotle implied as much when he stated that the belief that all\n\nthings are from God is  \u001cthe old explanation which we have all\n\ninherited from our fathers\u001d  ( 397b13-16), in other words, as Pansa\n\nput it,  \u001c it is drawn from the Hebrews, whose doctrine is most\n\nancient, going back in time beyond all Greek tradition.\"23\n\n  Pansa 's theory was further developed later in the seventeenth\n\ncentury by Pierre-Daniel Huet, who in his  Demonstratio evangelica \n\nof 1679 attempted to underpin the idea of an  \u001cancient theology\u001d\n\n stretching back to Moses by locating historical characters who could\n\nhave acted as conduits for the transmission of Old Testament doctrines to the\n\nheathen.\n In Josephus and Eusebius, Huet found a reference to a Peripatetic\n\nnamed Clearchus, who reported that his teacher Aristotle had conversed with a\n\nJew.\n The fruit of this conversation, Huet maintained, could be found in\n\n Metaphysics  12 and also in what Aristotle said in  De mundo\n\n ( 397b13-16) about the ancient doctrine that God produced and preserved\n\nall things,  \u001cwhich certainly seems to pertain to Moses.\"24\n , published eleven years\n\nlater, Huet came to believe, for unspecified reasons, that  De mundo\n\n was spurious.\n He now attributed the work to an anonymous author more recent than\n\nAristotle; and the passage he had previously quoted as evidence of Mosaic\n\ninfluence on the philosopher was now used to show that certain Peripatetics\n\nhad not followed Aristotle in denying the creation of the world.25", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "daf3d600-d942-4d37-a722-8ccdd112cb43", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.683027+00:00"}

if it 's a laptop, try a different battery and power adapter,\n\nif you have another one handy.\n For desktops, make sure that all your internal plugs and cards are\n\nproperly seated--graphics card, RAM, everything. \n\n  If none of this helps, it 's probably a problem with your\n\nmotherboard or power supply, and unless you've got spare parts handy, you' 've\n\nprobably best 'ref calling the manufacturer 's tech support line. \n\n  If your PC turns on, but won't successfully boot into Windows:\n\nFirst, start booting up, and press F8 repeatedly during the boot process.\n This may allow you to access a menu that lets you select different\n\nboot options with your keyboard, one of which is \" Safe Mode\".\n\n  Select Safe Mode, uninstall the last thing you installed, update\n\nall your drivers ( if you need to download new ones, you may need to select\n\nthe \" Safe Mode With Networking\" option instead), and open up the System\n\nRestore app ( Start Menu, Accessories, System Tools, System Restore) to roll\n\nback to an earlier point when your PC could successfully start up. \n\n  Safe Mode not working?\n Your hard drive might be failing.\n Get your rescue drive or manufacturer recovery discs, boot up from\n\nit, and save whatever data you haven't backed up. \n\n  Then run your disk diagnostic app--you can always run Check Disk,\n\nwhich is built into Windows, by right-clicking your hard drive, selecting\n\nProperties, clicking the Tools tab and selecting Check now... under the \"\n\nError Checking\" tab.\n There 's no cure for bad sectors--you'll have to re 'llce the drive.\n\n\n\n  If you hear your PC emitting a set of beeps during the startup\n\nprocess, it 's most likely your BIOS trying to tell you that you have a\n\nmotherboard-level problem with your PC--your processor fan might be\n\nunplugged, for example, or your power supply might not be working. \n\n  The beep patterns aren't standard, so you'll have to g 'llon a\n\ndifferent PC and check out your BIOS manufacturer 's Web site to figure out\n\nwhat 's wrong. \n\n  If Windows successfully boots, then crashes soon afterwards:\n\nStart by updating all your drivers--first, the essential drivers provided by\n\nyour PC manufacturer, then the drivers for your peripherals and extra\n\ndevices.\n\n\n  If your PC is crashing soon after startup, try uninstalling\n\nanything you recently downloaded and checking your startup apps and\n\nbackground processes to see if something is going wrong. \n\n  You can view the processes in the Task Manager by pressing\n\nCtrl-Shift-Esc and clicking the Processes tab--and you can use\n\nProcessLibrary.com as a reference for figuring out the obscure ones.\n For startup items, search for msconfig and click on the Startup tab\n\nto see what 's going on.\n If something you recently installed shows up in there, it might be\n\nyour culprit. \n\n  If your crashes aren't so easy to reproduce, try running a scan\n\nfor viruses and malware with your preferred security suite. \n\n  On the other hand, if you recently installed a new security suite\n\nand started seeing problems, try uninstalling it and then use a different\n\none.\n Security apps typically get deeper into the guts of your system than\n\nother apps, meaning they're more pro 'reto incompatibilities. \n\n  Still can't figure it out?\n Google can be your best friend when it comes to troubleshooting,\n\nespecially if you have an error message handy--even if the official support\n\nsites haven't covered your specific problem, odds are that someone has posted\n\non a tech forum about it. \n\n  Search for the specific error message--in quotes--for best\n\nresults, and if you can't find an immediately obvious error message, try\n\nlooking in Control Panel, Problem Reports and Solutions ( Vista);

type in ipconfig / renew.\n This will tell your PC to get a new IP address, a step that can clear\n\nup several network issues. \n\n  If that doesn't work, try checking the networking settings on\n\neach of your PCs by going to Control Panel, Network and Sharing Center,\n\nChange Adapter Settings and opening up the panel for the networking device (\n\nLocal Area Connection for wired networks, or Wireless Network Connection for\n\nWi-Fi, usually) that you're trying 're use, and click Details. \n\n  From here, you should find clues to what might be going on.\n If it says \" No\" under \" DHCP Enabled,\" then your PC is trying to use\n\na preexisting IP address, subnet mask, and DNS server information to connect\n\nto your network.\n Normally, most home networks use DHCP ( Dynamic Host Configuration\n\nProtocol) to automatically assign addresses to new PCs on the network, so all\n\nyou have to do is plug in ( or connect via Wi-Fi), and you're good t 'reo.\n Close the Details window and click Properties; click Internet\n\nProtocol Version 4 ( TCP/IPv4), then Properties.\n From here, just switch the radio buttons from \" Use the following IP\n\naddress\" and \" Use the following DNS server addresses\" to \" Obtain an IP\n\naddress automatically\" and \" Obtain DNS server address automatically.\" \n\n  If your IPv4 address starts with \" 169.254.\", your PC is trying\n\nto use DHCP to get an IP address and Domain Name Server information for that\n\nnetwork automatically.\n However, an IP address starting with those two numbers means either\n\nthat the DHCP server on the network ( typically the router, in small home\n\nnetworks) isn't working, or that it 's not enabled, and you'll nee 'llo\n\nmanually enter the IP address, subnet mask, and DNS server information on\n\nyour own. \n\n  You can do this by going into the Network Connections window,\n\nright-clicking on the network interface you're tryi 'reto use, and selecting\n\nProperties. \n\n  From here, you should select Internet Protocol Version 4 (\n\nTCP/IPv4); click Properties, and then both the Use the following IP address\n\nradio button and the Use the following DNS server addresses radio button to\n\nenter them in.\n However, you'll pro 'llly need to get that information from whoever\n\nset up your home network; most home networks use DHCP to cut down the hassle.\n\n\n\n\n  Printers can break, jam, and drop print quality suddenly.\n Here 's what you can do about these common printing headaches.\n If your printer jams: You're go 're to need to get that paper out of\n\nyour printer before you do anything else.\n It pays to check your printer 's documentation to make sure you\n\nextricate the paper in a way that does not damage your printer 's internal\n\nmechanics. \n\n  Specifically, check the manual for advice on how to get to where\n\nthe paper is stuck ( an access door or release lever), and how to remove the\n\nsheet--ideally, in one piece, as removing smaller bits can be a real pain.\n If you can't find your manual, the basic rule of thumb is to pull\n\ngently on the paper in the direction that it would be exiting--i.e., forward,\n\nnot backward, in the paper path.\n If you can't get the whole piece of paper, look carefully for the\n\nstray scraps and extract them with tweezers, as they could cause another jam.\n\n\n\n  When it comes to paper jams, they're 'reier to prevent than to\n\nfix.\n Start by taking good care of your paper--make sure it is stored\n\nsmooth, dry, and flat.\n Do not feed folded, dogeared, torn, or otherwise less-than-perfect\n\npaper into your printer. \n\n  Also, don't let paper sit for more than a day in vertical-feed\n\ntrays, as the pages can bend slightly ( affecting their ability to feed\n\nsmoothly) and the pressure of the paper on the rollers might affect the\n\nrollers' functionality. \n\n  Finally, adjust your paper tray to fit the paper you're 'reng.\n A carelessly set width or length guide can affect how the paper feeds\n\nand possibly cause a jam.\n Also, most printers these days have their own maintenance functions\n\nthat will realign and clean the printer heads.\n Run through those once or twice and see if that helps.\n If your printer is printing slowly: A handful of different factors\n\ncould be slowing down your print speed.\n\n\n  First off, check to make sure you're 'ret printing in a\n\nhigh-quality or \" best\" mode, which will take longer than a default or draft\n\nmode.\n Depending on what you're 'reinting, your connection to your printer\n\nmight be bottlenecking the print rate.\n Wireless connections can be affected by distance from the printer,\n\nairwave interference, and physical barriers, and USB connections have\n\nnarrower bandwidth than ethernet connections. \n\n  If you print run-of-the mill documents, largely text and some\n\nphotos, than a wireless or USB connection should be adequate.\n If you print complex or high-res graphics or have a lot of people\n\ntrying to use the printer, ethernet is better suited for bigger or busier\n\ntraffic.\n Also, most consumer printers rely on your PC to process the print\n\njob, so if your PC 's memory and processor are already heavily taxed your jobs\n\nwill take longer to process. \n\n  If a printer does have its own memory ( usually one designed to\n\nwork in an office), check to make sure there is enough memory to handle the\n\ncomplexity and quantity of jobs you are sending to it.\n Did problems begin after you started to print a lot more than usual?\n Check the printer 's monthly duty cycle to see how much it 's designed\n\nto push out. \n\n  If you started off with a consumer-level printer designed to\n\nprint perhaps up to a few dozen pages a day, but you are now printing a\n\nhundred or more pages a day, your old printer is probably struggling to keep\n\nup.\n If you are printing 25 percent or more of the monthly duty cycle\n\nspec, then you should probably get a printer with a higher monthly duty\n\ncycle.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5b2df835-d8f3-4c19-8944-cabe798fc12f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.684631+00:00"}

{"text": "In our rush to build the Web, we've fallen into some really\n\nlimiting hab 've when it comes to both our visual designs and our technology\n\npresentations.\n\n  When I first started in Web design, I grabbed at everything that\n\ncame down the assembly line: graphics, animation, Flash.\n If I didn't use something, I read about it and tried out the code, the\n\nsoftware, or the technique.\n I experimented, and I loved it all.\n In my frenzy, I made some offensive mistakes, and I still make them.\n But I'm learning a lot, and one thing I'm noticing is that 'my bad\n\nhabits have sometimes g 'mten in the way of designing aesthetically great\n\nsites that embrace today 's recommended markup and related practices.\n It 's like being a self-taught guitar player.\n\n\n  In our rush to build the Web, we've fallen into some really\n\nlimiting h 'vets when it comes to both our visual designs and our technology\n\npresentations.\n The more I study markup\u0014especially in the context of XML\u0014the more I'm\n\nconvinced that the solution to our design wo 'm lies in the essence of markup,\n\nand not in the fun frills. \n\n  In my early days as a Web designer, I had friends who'd been in\n\nthe compute 'dindustry for years, had been using the Internet for email,\n\nTelnet, FTP, and Usenet.\n They hated graphics, even hated the idea of GUI access to the Web.\n They made fun of me for anticipating the possibility of a visual Web,\n\nmuch less a media-rich Web. \n\n<P>  It 's odd for me\u0014especially with my love of broadband and clever\n\nFlash design\u0014to come around to a purist point of view when it comes to visual\n\nWeb design.\n Perhaps I'm not as radical as the friends who once teased 'me, and I\n\ndon't regret my experimental frenzy one bit.\n But now it 's time for all of us to pay attention to what we're doing,\n\nwhy we're d 'reg it, and for who 're\n We're challenged to grow in 'rethe new wireless and alternative design\n\noptions. \n\n  To formulate a successful contemporary design, we must first\n\nstudy visual design mistakes, examine the alternatives, and find solutions in\n\nmarkup.\n When we integrate visual design concepts and today 's recommended\n\nmarkup options, we make a surprising find:\n A Web site can be aesthetically appropriate and completely\n\ncross-browser, cross-platform compliant. \n\n\n  We tried to make the Web multimedia, but it isn't.\n Multimedia means multiple media forms operating in an integrated\n\nenvironment.\n However, the Web was never meant to be a platform for simultaneous\n\ndelivery of multiple media forms.\n It was originally created for text.\n It can deliver multimedia, but the Web is at root a text environment\n\nwith links as an added component.\n\n  The ability to link from one document to many other supportive or\n\nreferential documents meant that we could break free of the more linear\n\nconstructs that defined books.\n When the Web became a graphical environment, it was no longer just\n\ntext that was linked.\n Rather, graphics or other media became the objects of this\n\nhyper-environment.\n And so emerged hypermedia.\n This extension beyond the linear structure is what makes it \" hyper,\"\n\nor more than what we had previously experienced.\n\n\n\n There are very important differences between multimedia and hypermedia.\n Multimedia is dimensional, and while it 's almost always interactive,\n\nthat interactivity is restricted by context.\n Hypermedia can also be described as dimensional, but in a less\n\nliteral sense.\n Hypermedia adds dimension to a two-dimensional space by attracting a\n\ncritical mass of people who keep it vibrant and constantly alive.\n This \" dimension\" has yet to be defined, but its impact is obvious.\n Context is less critical for hypermedia than for multimedia, and\n\nhypermedia is more organic\u0014it 's defined by interactivity, while multimedia\n\nmore closely resembles a presentation. \n\n  Consider more traditional delivery methods for multimedia, such\n\nas CD-ROM presentations or kiosks with touch screens.\n Access is pretty much limited to one person\u0014at most a few\u0014at any\n\ngiven time.\n The Web can be extremely human in a way that these devices cannot.\n The fact that we're present in interac 'rens with one another on such\n\na massive scale changes the scope of visual communication\u0014or all\n\ncommunication\u0014greatly. \n\n  However, the limitations and ungainliness of multimedia somehow\n\nfound their way into the visual design of the Web, and it 's not a good fit.\n\n\n\n  Because the Web emerged from a text environment, it 's unlikely\n\nthat most people thought \" TV\" when they first saw pages in Mosaic.\n As far as I recall, a graphic looked ungainly against a mid-gray\n\nbackground.\n\n\n  We began creating dimensional objects for Web sites when 15-inch\n\nmonitors were all the rage.\n Consider what a mistake it was to try to create dimension on a screen\n\nthat small.\n We did it anyway, and we set a very poor precedent.\n ( After all, now that portable devices are all the rage, screens are\n\nonly getting smaller.) \n\n  Today 's average monitor has a 17-inch screen, only slightly\n\nbigger than a breadbox.\n Bear in mind that I'm purposely not talking about resolu 'mon here,\n\nI'm talking about physical size, mass. 'm It 's ridiculous to try to stuff so much onto a page.\n Whether it 's text, graphics, media\u0014I don't care.\n We don't need so many bells and whistles.\n Simplicity is almost always beautiful, and even at its worst it 's not\n\noffensive. \n\n  So why do we continue to stuff our pages until the seams strain?\n\nIt all started when we recognized the Web as a possible platform for\n\nmultimedia, and then decided that multimedia was the best way to use the Web.\n Sadly, this marginalized hypermedia, as evident in the vast\n\nproliferation of debris left over from early days of design\u0014overblown\n\ngraphics, dancing GIFs, and pages that come complete with soundtracks.\n We tried to make the Web multimedia.\n And frighteningly enough, we're still doing 're\n\n\n  Let 's examine what we're doing wit 'reesign.\n Isn't it possible that we compromised our ability to explore a\n\nuniquely fresh hypermedia environment by imposing an existing notion of\n\nmultimedia instead? \n\n  Why do we want to create objects and place visual ideas in a Web\n\nenvironment that is so obviously visually flat? I think we're striving 're\n\nsomething that 's tactile.\n We've tried to make 've Web something we could happily touch instead\n\nof embracing its more abstract qualities: a nonlinear approach to the flow of\n\nthought and information, and an interactive dimension that\u0014while not\n\ntactile\u0014promises rich experiences for the user. \n\n\n  Unfortunately, our problems don't stop with multimedia clutter.\n Once we've swept away the 'vecess, we'll have t 'lleal with the rigid,\n\nangular pages left behind. \n\n  Rectangles are completely limiting.\n We've allowed ourse 'ves to be bound by the de facto system of a Web\n\npage 's infrastructure, particularly in terms of content and shape.\n We're taking 'ree physical mass of a 17-inch monitor and essentially\n\npasting more rectangles inside its rectangular frame.\n\n\n  What 's even more interesting is examining the markup we've been\n\nus 've to achieve our layouts, namely tables and sometimes frames.\n Again, we're worki 'reon very rigid, rectangular models.\n The same is true for those few angels who've found a w 'veto make CSS\n\npositioning work for them.\n\n\n  Why do we try to box everything in? Global human expression is\n\nfilled with curved shapes and structures\u0014circles, spirals, and spheres.\n Yet those of us in the Western world favor lines, angles, and\n\nrectangles.\n We've revered a 'verespected the linear for so long that the phrase \"\n\nthinking outside the box\" has become synonymous with revolutionary\n\ninnovation. \n\n  Look at a wall in your home.\n If you have a nice painting or poster, it 's probably in a rectangular\n\nframe.\n Windows are rectangles; doors are rectangles.\n This shape makes up a lot of our world.\n And that 's fine, but we have sky out there too.\n A screen has no sky.\n\n  What it does have is more rectangles.\n You have a frame around the monitor, your browser frames your\n\ncontent, and some people put borders and frames into the visual design of\n\ntheir pages.\n For those of you who eschew borders and frames, you're sti 'rebuilding\n\non a grid system, which frames the infrastructure.\n So how do we open things up, give our screens a little bit of sky?\n\n\n\n  It 's a fascinating problem.\n While CSS2 offers all kinds of powerful border, spacing, and padding\n\noptions, we've had a 'velution in CSS1 all along: the use of color and type to\n\nachieve shape within the inherent design.\n If you put all of that into a style sheet, and leave only your\n\ncontent in your markup document, the content will still be accessible by any\n\nother platform and device. \n\n\n  Several principles will help designers shift away from the\n\nlegacies of our early mistakes.\n Let 's move into an integrated methodology of client-side development\n\nthat marries markup and visual aesthetics. \n\n\n  If old belief systems suggest mimicking the tactile world, but\n\nadding dimension isn't working, then let go.\n\n\n  The Web, at least onscreen, is still a two-dimensional space.\n This is mechanically true because graphics are displayed in two\n\ndimensions.\n From a technical perspective, you can tap into extremely clean HTML\n\nor XHTML combined with CSS.\n Your site is then readable on every browser, platform, and\n\nappliance. \n\n  You've sepa 'veed your formatting and presentation effectively,\n\nand you've flat 'veed everything.\n You have no bevels, no buttons, no shadows, no light sources.\n You have no tabs, no drop-down menus.\n You do have color, and you do have content.\n\n\n\n  It 's nearly impossible to break out of the rectangular systems\n\nfor visual Web design.\n But contemporary design should open up confined space or create new\n\nways of looking at old space. \n\n  Wherever you can, avoid creating lots of rectangles unless you\n\nhave a specific reason for using them ( such as for expressing containment\n\nand security).\n Focus instead on the parts of shapes: lines, curves, and angles.\n If you do use rectangles, leave them flat against the\n\nbackground\u0014don't add bevels or drop shadows, or any dimension at all. \n\n  Ironically, this reduces file size, too.\n The more effects there are in a graphic, the harder it becomes to\n\ncompress. \n\n\n  I'm con 'mnced that the best designs use only graphics that are\n\nabsolutely necessary.\n If you limit your use of graphics, the ones you do use will grab\n\nmuch more attention, especially if they're 'rell planned and well placed. \n\n  Use text for links, rely on CSS for effects like removing\n\nunderlines or creating rollovers.\n Rely on color for fonts, headers, and all link options.\n Again, use CSS wherever possible to separate the presentation from\n\nthe markup, keeping the markup itself very clean. \n\n\n  Hate me if you want to, but in most cases, scripting, Flash,\n\nShockwave, and QuickTime elements aren't necessary.\n Sure, if you're 'reilding the next big alternative rock band 's Web\n\nsite, go get happy.\n And independent Flash artists\u0014you keep doing what you'r 'reoing.\n But when it comes to most commercial site design situations, rely on\n\nclever CSS color schemes and keep your markup as uncluttered as possible.\n\n\n\n\n  Contemporary visual design should strive to be flat.\n It should denounce old belief systems about what kind of medium the\n\nWeb really is and just visually embrace its simple dimension. \n\n  Flat design is not only an aesthetic or reactionary choice; it 's\n\nalso a choice that integrates perfectly with Web markup methodologies.\n This means successfully separating content and presentation, which\n\npositions your site for the Web, for wireless, for backward-compatible\n\nbrowsers, for anything. \n\n  Today 's Web sites remain frighteningly poor in terms of visual\n\ndesign and markup practices.\n I 'm convinced that in their current state, Web standards and visual\n\ntrends are perfectly matched to offer the best visual design and the\n\ncleanest, most platform-versatile offerings around.\n Learning to balance these issues is the best gift we can give to our\n\naudiences, and ourselves. \n\n  Molly is the author of numerous books on visual design and Web\n\nmarkup.\n She holds an M.A. in media studies from New School University.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d03c3cab-c714-4b2a-a04d-92531af84b2a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.686901+00:00"}
{"text": "Dwayne Hanson picked a piece of tobacco off his tongue and wiped\n\nit inside the pocket of his black denim duster.\n He dropped his eighth cigarette and carefully stamped it out.\n He pulled out another unfiltered Lucky, flipped open his hammered\n\nsilver lighter and thumbed it on, cupping the flame in his hands so that it\n\nwould not be seen by the boy he hunted. \n\n  He stood on a cushion of needles under a large pine tree.\n At six feet tall, he was a foot below its lowest limb.\n The long drooping branches formed a natural tent with a twelve foot\n\ndiameter that he had been pacing for the past two hours.\n Puffing on his cigarette, he walked around the tree again and tipped\n\nhis watch so it caught the faint light filtering in from a nearby street\n\nlamp.\n Almost midnight.\n The damp chill of the early May night was beginning to heighten his\n\nirritation. \n\n  \" Too damn cold,\" he muttered.\n Maybe it was that hole in the ozone.\n He shook his head - who gives a shit?\n Where was that little weasel?\n\n\n  Being loaned out was really eating at him.\n This waiting in the cold only made it seem worse.\n Frankie Fallo had given him to some arrogant creep like he was a\n\nloaner car or something- so, of course, the guy treated him just like that.\n Go here, watch that one, do this...lucky that Dwayne Hanson was a\n\nprofessional.\n\n\n  Three hours ago he had been watching the woman.\n He had been on her for five days.\n He smirked - he'd like to 'd on her for five days.\n She was was as hot as she looked.\n She probably wasn't.\n How could she be and be hanging with this college punk?\n He even had a pansy name - James Elsinor Ryerson, Junior, for\n\nChrist 's sake.\n Well, the junior part was right, he was in deep shit way over his\n\ngirl 's hair head.\n What could the bitch see in this kid?\n Hanson 's thick lips twisted in a grin.\n Who could figure broads?\n\n\n  The campus was almost deserted with only an occasional couple\n\nstrolling by on the concrete walkway twenty feet from his tree.\n An hour ago, he had actually waved his arms to see if anyone would\n\nnotice him.\n No one seemed to.\n A good sign in case it got messy.\n\n\n  He ground out this butt with the others and was about to twist\n\nanother between his lips when he saw someone emerge from behind a large\n\ngranite building at the edge of the campus.\n He pocketed the cigarette, staring through the branches.\n The figure walked to the narrow drive that divided the campus,\n\npaused, then hurried across.\n Dwayne Hanson saw that it was a male and, more importantly, it looked\n\nas if he wore his hair in a ponytail.\n It had to be Ryerson.\n The boy stopped again by the bookstore, still looking from side to\n\nside.\n He carried a large manila envelope in his right hand.\n Damn, Hanson thought, the little punk 's got the goods with him.\n Perfect.\n\n\n  The boy left the bookstore and approached the English building,\n\nappropriately covered with ivy.\n He paused again under a walkway light and Hanson saw the blonde hair,\n\npulled back tight in a ponytail.\n Jimmy Ryerson for sure, denim jacket and all, going to see his pal\n\njust as the caller had said.\n The boy continued toward North Hall, a Gothic dorm which reminded\n\nHanson of something out of an old vampire movie.\n It stood ten yards beyond his hiding place.\n Pulling a lead-filled blackjack from his duster pocket, Hanson tapped\n\nit against his leg.\n One shot behind the ear and the punk'd be a 'drooling mess.\n Just drag him into the bushes beside that English building and see\n\nwhat was what.\n He slid through the branches and moved silently across the lawn,\n\ncoming up on Ryerson from behind.\n Three feet away, he swung the sap back and reached for the dungaree\n\nshoulder.\n At that instant, the boy glanced back, saw him and leaped away with a\n\nstartled cry.\n Hanson 's hand grabbed air and he almost fell.\n Rage filled him as he caught his balance and spun around to see Jimmy\n\nRyerson sprinting back the way he had come.\n Hanson stuffed the blackjack back in his pocket and went after him.\n\n\n\n  Jimmy Ryerson had run track in high school.\n Even with five beers in him, he instinctively lengthened his stride\n\nand pulled his rhythmically pumping arms closer to his body.\n Glancing back, he could see he was pulling away from the curly-headed\n\nman in the flapping duster.\n It was the same guy who had visited his step-father, no question.\n\n\n  Past the bookstore, he saw South Hall, the twin of North, and\n\nangled toward it.\n This guy would have to back off if other people were around.\n The quickest way into the dorm was through a side door, almost hidden\n\nby flowering Forsythia bushes.\n Ryerson remembered that the flowers were a bright yellow, but they\n\nlooked a sickly white in the moonlight.\n He pushed through them, seized the doorknob in his left hand and\n\npulled.\n The door shuddered, but did not open.\n The curly-headed man 's footsteps were closer.\n An arc of terror made him fumble and almost drop the manila envelope\n\nas he switched hands. \n\n  As he grabbed the door in his stronger right hand and pulled it\n\nopen, something sharp hit him beneath his right eye.\n Three inches from his head a piece of wood had been torn out of the\n\ndoor.\n As he focused on that, a hole popped in the chicken-wire window in\n\nthe center of the door. \n\n \n\n  He dove through the door and down three metal steps that led into\n\nthe basement, landing on his knees in the corridor.\n Pain paralyzed him for a moment, but fear stood him up and pushed him\n\ntoward the staircase in the center of the building.\n He knew he wouldn't be safe from this madman, no matter how many\n\npeople were here.\n As he reached the steps, he heard the door behind him slam open and\n\nglass break.\n The sound propelled him up the stairs and into a collision with four\n\nstudents entering the front door.\n He pushed through them and was outside, their curses trailing him.\n\n\n\n  Dwayne Hanson 's breath felt like liquid fire and sweat ran freely\n\ndown his back.\n The kid was in the building.\n Some lucky, that punk.\n Shooting on the run was the only reason he had missed.\n The Ruger twenty-two with its three inch silencer was still in his\n\nright hand as he burst through the basement door, vaguely aware of glass\n\nbreaking as he slammed it against the wall.\n His focus was on the hallway and there, just past the vending\n\nmachines, an exit sign.\n\n\n  As he reached the stairwell, he heard voices echoing in it.\n Ramming the .22 into its holster, he took the steps two at a time.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Four students milled around the front door.\n The one yelling, Hanson 's height with a brushcut, was still leaning\n\nout the door.\n Hanson grabbed him by the belt and propelled him out of the building\n\nand down the two entry steps where he lost his footing and sprawled\n\nface-first onto the sidewalk.\n Brushcut screamed in pain, then began scrambling to his feet,\n\nswearing.\n Hanson pulled his blackjack from his coat and rapped him with it.\n In mid-curse, Brushcut 's legs folded as he dropped to his knees and\n\npitched sideways, just making the grass. \n\n  Ryerson was nowhere in sight.\n Hanson ran to the end of the dorm and stared into a grove of trees\n\nand brush.\n He knew the punk was in there and that he wasn't going get him\n\ntonight. \n\n  \" Fuck,\" he said aloud.\n Now he'd 'dave to call that jerk and explain how he had screwed up.\n\n\n  The three college kids were trying to revive their friend when\n\none of them saw Hanson returning.\n He whispered to the others and, without a word - or their friend,\n\nthey scurried back into the building. \n\n  Hanson had to grin.\n College kids were never as smart as they thought they were, but at\n\nleast these three were smart enough to know what was good for them. \n\n\n  Nicholas Carmody was six feet tall, dressed in a sleeveless\n\nsweatshirt, stained blue jeans and work boots.\n A faded red bandanna covered his hair.\n He held a three foot tapered metal shaft in his gloved hand and\n\nstared at it.\n He tipped the metal so that it glowed in the overhead lights.\n\n\n  He clamped the shaft in a vise on his work bench then removed\n\nhis safety goggles to examine it more closely.\n Absently pulling on his salt and pepper moustache, he walked around\n\nthe piece until he nodded to himself.\n Picking up a striker, he lit his acetylene torch, adjusted the flame\n\nthen plopped a welding mask on his head and began cutting irregular pieces\n\nout of one edge of the metal. \n\n  He stopped because even the intentionally random cuts seemed too\n\nplanned.\n Closing his eyes, he moved the torch along the glowing metal.\n When he opened them, he found he had almost severed the tip, but it\n\ndid look better. \n\n  Carmody turned off the torch and removed his mask.\n He loosened the blade from the vise enjoying its warmth through his\n\nasbestos glove.\n He positioned it on a metal anvil, slipped on his goggles and began\n\nmolding it with a heavy hammer.\n Cords of muscles stood out on his arms and shoulders.\n\n\n  As he hit the jagged metal, he experienced an odd mix of\n\nfeelings again.\n First, there was a sense of being detached and watching this object\n\nform before his eyes almost as if he weren't shaping it with his blows.\n But under that was a subtle excitement deep in his body.\n It had a surge to it that felt as if it were sexual or, at least,\n\ncame from a parallel source.\n It intensified until it seemed to consume him, making him work the\n\nsteel faster, but with greater delicacy. \n\n<P>  Yeah, he thought, maybe it comes from the sexual part of the\n\nbrain.\n Then he interrupted himself by realizing that he never had these\n\nkinds of thoughts before he started drawing and making sculpture.\n Sure, he had always thought about women- the way they looked, their\n\ndifferent scents, the incredible smoothness of their skin.\n But hammering metal and coming up with a connection to sex...well,\n\nthat seemed pretty weird.\n It was definitely new territory for him and, as such, felt strange\n\nand a little embarrassing.\n His grip tightened and he was on it now, making this steel bend to\n\nhis will until, paradoxically, it gave him whatever it chose to share.\n It was ironic that this process seemed sexual to him because it also\n\nreminded him of his recent experiences with women when he had tried to be in\n\ncontrol but always wound up shaking his head, wondering what the hell was\n\ngoing on.\n He was grateful that sculpture was easier than people.\n He was also grateful that he didn't have to share these new\n\nthoughts.\n Sometimes, when he had them, he would imagine what it would be like\n\nto still be a cop and have to tell someone about them.\n Of course, it would always be someone like that idiot, Brennahan, an\n\noverweight, chain-smoking red-neck sergeant who always looked as if he had\n\njust just crawled out of bed after a

world-class hard-on to handle that.\n Cops, most of them a little crazy, a lot crude - he didn't miss any\n\nof it, except sometimes...\n He stopped and studied the battered, asymmetrical shape.\n \" Better,\" he said aloud.\n Carmody turned to the large sculpture that shared the thousand\n\nsquare foot studio with him.\n It lay tilted on its side.\n The base, a rough-cut seven foot oak pillar, was braced by thick\n\nblocks of wood anchored to the floor.\n The top consisted of an almost completed five-foot ball of wood and\n\nmetal spikes and was supported by a heavy wooden saw-horse.\n The

{"text": "Frankfurt, Germany--Center stage at the auto show that opens here\n\ntoday are a pair of little bubble-topped cars that represent a potential\n\nindustry breakthrough.\n\n  The models whose unveiling this morning attracted about 2,000 auto\n\nexecutives and journalists aren't pollution-free wondermobiles, or even\n\nmost-elegant Mercedes-Benz and BMW sedans.\n Instead, they're a pair of ordinary subco 'rects from Chrysler Corp.\n with an extraordinary mission: to become Detroit 's first small cars to\n\nsell well, drive comfortably AND make a profit.\n\n  The new Dodge and Plymouth Neon are noteworthy this morning for\n\nanother reason: Their Frankfurt debut marks the first time one of the Big\n\nThree first introduced an American-made car abroad.\n But then never before has a U.S. car counted on overseas sales so\n\nheavily for its success.\n\n  Successfully marketing small cars has been Detroit 's Holy Grail\n\nfor the past three decades.\n\n\n  General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet Corvair attempted to copy the\n\nrear-engine design of the popular Volkswagen Beetle, only to spawn Ralph\n\nNader and his book Unsafe at Any Speed.\n Ford Motor Co.tried to stem rising Japanese car sales with the Pinto.\n But court setbacks over fuel-tank explosions sank the Pinto\n\ninstead.\n\n  American Motors Corp., which pioneered Detroit 's plunge into\n\nsmall cars during the late ' 50s, produced one of the ugliest cars ever\n\nconceived--the squat Pacer.\n Even the Ford Escort, one of the best-sellers in Ford 's history, has\n\nfailed to produce profits.\n\n  Through it all, top Big Three executives were uncomfortable with\n\nsmall cars and the modest profits they produced.\n And by producing unsatisfactory cars like the Pinto or the Chevrolet\n\nVega, Detroit merely fed the rush of young, affluent buyers to foreign\n\ncars.\n\n  \" By creating awareness of the practicality, even pleasure, that\n\nis inherent in driving a small automobile--and then marketing mediocre Vegas\n\nand Pintos--Ford and General Motors were generating increased potential sales\n\nfor Volkswagen, Toyota and ( Nissan),\" auto writer Brock Yates observed in\n\nhis 1983 book The Decline and Fall of the American Automobile Industry.\n\n  Now, Chrysler is hoping to reshape the perception of America 's\n\nsmall cars.\n To do, it is banking its recent string of comeback vehicles on the\n\nNeons-as Chrysler describes them, \" cute\" four-seaters with roomy,\n\ncab-forward interiors, standard dual air bags and peppy 2.0-liter, 16-valve\n\nengines likely to sell for less than\n\n&dollar; 9,000.\n\n  The car 's biggest drawback: It comes with only a three-speed\n\nautomatic transmission, while many of its competitors offer a more\n\nmodern--and often more efficient--four-speed.\n\n  The debut of the Neons caps a year in which the once-troubled\n\ncarmaker won raves for its new mid-sized sedans, sold Jeep Grand Cherokees as\n\nfast as it could make them, prepared to thrust a bold, new entrant into the\n\nU.S. pickup truck market and slashed its enormous debt.\n\n  \" With the recent positive view of Chrysler as a clever,\n\ninnovative, dynamic company, they're certainly trying 'remove that halo over\n\nthe Neon,\" said David E.Cole, director of the University of Michigan 's Office\n\nfor the Study of Automotive Transportation.\n\n\n  Indeed, the Neons represent more than just additional new\n\nproducts for Chrysler.\n\n  The Neons are Chrysler 's first new subcompacts since 1978 's Dodge\n\nOmni and Plymouth Horizon.\n When Neons start selling in the United States in January, the company\n\nhopes they will win back long-lost market share from the Japanese.\n In Europe, the little car could play a big role in re-establishing\n\nChrysler as a mainstream automaker.\n\n  Building the Neons \" was really a counter-attack to get back what\n\nwe used to have,\" said Robert P.Marcell, Chrysler general manager of\n\nsmall-car engineering and leader of the team that built the Neons.\n\n  But the Neons' most-notable achievement would be to make\n\nmoney--or at least not lose it.\n\n  \" In today 's very demanding auto industry, you really don't want\n\nto do money-losing products,\" said Joe Caddell, Chrysler 's general product\n\nmanager of small cars.\n\n  With subcompacts, that 's easier said than done, for reasons both\n\nof necessity and choice.\n\n  For one thing, small cars cost nearly as much to design and build\n\nas larger cars.\n But bigger autos command proportionately bigger prices, producing\n\nbigger profits.\n\n  In the past, the Big Three ere willing to accept the trade-off\n\nbecause the unprofitable small cars helped them average out the fuel economy\n\nof their car lineups to meet federal standards.\n\n  Small cars also inhabit a corner of the market that doesn't allow\n\nmuch room for price hikes.\n \" With 22 nameplates, it 's by far the most competitive segment in the\n\nworld,\" Marcell said.\n\n  Former Chrysler Chairman Lee A.Iacocca initially wanted to spread\n\nthe cost of building the Neons by getting Fiat 's help.\n \" Iacocca was sort of the small car 's biggest advocate and biggest\n\nadversary,\" Caddell said.\n \" It was kind of a love-hate relationship, like, \" I'd really l 'de to\n\ndo a small car, but, damn it, I can't figure out why.'\"\n\n  Marcell and his team convinced Iacocca that they could build a\n\nprofitable subcompact if they dispensed with conventional thinking.\n They knew \" if we did things the same way we had done things for the\n\npast 20 years in Detroit, we would end up disappointed,\" Marcell said.\n\n  The result: Chrysler spent\n\n&dollar; 1.3 billion to bring the Neons to market.\n By loose comparison, Ford a helled? out\n\n&dollar; 6 billion for its Mondeo \" world cars\" and GM spent\n\n&dollar; 5 billion to give birth to Saturn.\n Chrysler figures that difference means each Neon will cost about\n\n&dollar;500 less to build than its close competitors.\n\n  The Neon team began by tearing apart rival models and talking to\n\nhundreds of consumers to determine how to make a car that would address\n\nbuyers' two main beefs with subcompacts: They look unsafe and they're no fun\n\n'reto drive.\n\n  Following Chrysler 's \" platform team\" development concept,\n\ndesigners, engineers, production planners, suppliers and line workers worked\n\ntogether to trim costs while adding features normally not offered by\n\nsubcompacts.\n As a result, Neon will arrive in dealerships after a 31-month\n\ngestation, beating the average Big Three development pace by more than a year\n\nand rivaling Japan 's swiftness.\n\n  \" What the team tried to do is question every step of the way why\n\nyou do things and why they can't be done a different way,\" Caddell said.\n \" When you save\n\n&dollar; 1.50 here and\n\n&dollar; 2 there, it does add up.\"\n\n  For example, the Neon planners counted seven different types of\n\nfasteners that had been used to attach doors to door panels on the Plymouth\n\nSundance, Chrysler 's current small car.\n\n\n  \" That means you've got one 'vepplier vs.\n seven,\" Caddell said.\n \" You've got one 'vex ( of parts) on the assembly line vs.\n seven.\n You've got one 'verque wrench at one torque setting instead of seven.\n You eliminate the cost of putting the wrong screw in the wrong\n\nhole.\"\n\n  Chrysler saved\n\n&dollar; 25 to\n\n&dollar; 35 a car by using a single air-bag crash sensor instead of the usual three\n\nto five.\n Bumpers were molded in color, making them recycleable and cutting\n\npainting costs.\n By locating satellite stamping facilities next to the main Neon\n\nassembly plant in Belvidere, Ill., Chrysler will reduce shipping costs and\n\nscrap.\n\n  Chrysler also is shelving the standard approach of supplying\n\ndifferent sales outlets with slightly different versions of the same car.\n Because research showed consumers see through such tactics, both\n\nDodge and Plymouth dealers will sell identical Neons, saving on engineering,\n\nadvertising and other costs.\n\n  The Neons seek to offer the basics consumers expect in a small\n\ncar: a modest price and decent fuel mileage.\n Caddell said the car will get just below 30 mpg in the city and at\n\nleast 35 mpg on the highway.\n\n  But Chrysler willingly sacrificed a bit of fuel economy to equip\n\nthe cars with a 2.0-liter, 16-valve engine--and make it more enjoyable to\n\ndrive.\n The car will accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in about nine seconds.\n \" It 's about the fastest car in the Chrysler Corp.\n\n\n  Dual air bags were included to address buyers' safety concerns.\n The car will meet federal safety standards for side-impact collisions\n\nfour years before they take effect.\n Enhancing the safety image is the availability of anti-lock brakes\n\nand built-in child seats as options.\n\n  \" We're not 'reoking at making a profit by making the product\n\ncheap,\" Caddell said.\n \" We're loo 'reg at making a profit by making the product\n\nefficient.\"\n\n  Will the Neon make money? As recently as January, retiree Iacocca\n\nsaid he doubted it.\n Analysts are more optimistic, but they think Chrysler will have to\n\nsell at let 300,000 Neons a year to pet it into the black.\n\n  That 's no easy task in a market as subdivided as America 's, and\n\nit shows why European sales are necessary for the Neons to succeed.\n\n  \" Volume is crucial,\" U-M 's Cole said.\n \" If for some reason the car doesn't sell...you've g 'vea serious\n\nproblem because your fixed costs are just about as high as with any\n\nproduct.\"\n\n  Four-door models will debut in the United States in January\n\nfollowed by two-doors in September.\n Chrysler plans to begin exporting four-door versions to Europe--where\n\nthe subcompact market is about twice as large as the U.S. market for small\n\ncars--in June.\n\n  Joseph Phillippi, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc.\n in New York, said some Chrysler managers are worried they won't have\n\nenough capacity in Illinois and at the plant in Mexico to satisfy demand.\n \" They're 'reually scratching their heads: 'What if the Neon is more\n\nsuccessful than we think?\"\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Ford Motor Co.and the United Auto Workers are considering a\n\nproposal to put the Wayne assembly plant on an unusual four-day work week--a\n\npossible model for alternative schedules elsewhere.\n\n  The plan under consideration in local negotiations calls for the\n\nplant to run two ten-hour shifts a day for four days.\n Plant management and UAW Local 900 have formed a committee to study\n\nthe idea, a union source said Wednesday.\n\n  The proposed schedule would help cut absenteeism, since workers\n\nwould enjoy three-day weekends.\n \" We believe the new schedule will help attendance,\" the source said.\n \" We took a survey, and about 90 percent of our members wanted\n\nit.\"\n\n  It would boost Ford 's capacity at the Wayne plant, which now\n\nbuilds Escort subcompacts.\n The company could easily schedule five or even six days of\n\nproduction.\n The extra capacity could become important later if Ford decides to\n\nmove additional Escort production from Mexico.\n\n  Utility expenses like heat and lighting would also fall if the\n\nplant didn't need to operate on the fifth day.\n\n  Unlike General Motors Corp.\n and Chrysler Corp., Ford has been reluctant to boost production by\n\nusing three work crews or three shifts at its assembly plants.\n Instead, Ford has relied on traditional overtime to get more vehicles\n\nout of some plants.\n\n  The four-day arrangement would not require Ford to hire a third\n\nshift of workers, as General Motors did at its Saturn plant in Spring Hill,\n\nTenn., and its Lordstown, Ohio, Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird\n\nassembly plant.\n\n  The main roadblock to changing the Wayne plant 's schedule seems\n\nto be overtime pay.\n Ford wants employees to work four ten-hour shifts at normal wage\n\nrates.\n But the union wants workers to be paid overtime for the extra two\n\nhours added to each daily shift.\n\n  Union leaders believe the extra day off at the Wayne plant could\n\nreduce unexcused absences from the plant 's current rate of 4 percent, which\n\nis slightly above the average absentee rate at Big Three factories.\n\n  Ford spokesman David Caplan declined to comment on the status of\n\nthe negotiations.\n However, Caplan did note that the company has not floated any formal\n\nproposals for a new work week in local negotiations.\n\n  A UAW source noted that similar proposals have cropped up from\n\ntime to time in previous negotiations with Ford locals.\n\n  Each UAW local negotiates its own three-year contract with\n\ncompany plant managers.\n Local agreements typically handle issues such as work rules,\n\noutsourcing, absenteeism and safety.\n Their importance has grown as automakers are racing to make their\n\noperations more efficient.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ae71fdf7-11ad-44d0-8ad6-7aaecfdffc88", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.689570+00:00"}

I haven't seen that\n\nsame boyfriend for over two years; I certainly don't want to go to\n\nVanderbilt; I wonder sometimes if I will ever have children.\n ( I do assume children will enter the picture at sometime, but it may\n\nor may not be by the time I'm 27.)\n The future holds no promises.\n I shiver at the magnitude of this thought, knowing that despite my\n\ncurrent plans ( to enter graduate school as soon as possible), anything can,\n\nand probably will, happen.\n\n Somewhere in the confusion of our futures lies our perfect selves,\n\ncrafted lovingly by the master 's hands.\n In highschool I was so sure of my future; I was certain that God\n\nwould also agree with my big plans.\n I guess those plans got lost in the debris of all those things God\n\nstripped from me so that I might become His more perfect creation.\n I have always heard that the changes God makes are like a refiner 's\n\nfire, constantly purging a precious metal of all impurities, until all else\n\nis gone but that which is purely precious.\n Instead of one dream, many stretch before me.\n I am certain one of them was planted there by God.\n It is waiting dormant, until God 's time, when it will spring forth to\n\nbe nurtured by my love and devotion, already rooted in the love and devotion\n\nof a gracious Father.\n\n Last night I dreamed that I was flying airplanes and teaching others to\n\njump out of them.\n And in that dream, I vaguely remember myself jumping, floating\n\nthrough the air steadily approaching the ground, my hand tightly clutching a\n\nparachute string, my insides filled with exhilaration.\n Once more in the airplane I am laughing and crying.\n My friend is there, nervous but excited about learning to jump.\n My mentor is there, erasing my uncertainty with her smile.\n That is where my dreams are.\n In the clouds.\n Basking in the sun.\n Freely communing with all winged creatures.\n God promised His eye is on the sparrow;

'm \" I can play with them and tease them and do weird things.\n That 's very entertaining for them.\n Everything is very loosey-goosey and they like that.\n\n\n  \" It disrupts what they think life 's about, and it makes them\n\nthink a little bit more.\n Maybe they'll pay more attention to 'llings around them, then tie it\n\ninto their work.\" \n\n  Ludwig 's ceramics program at this secondary school in Port\n\nOrange, Florida, just south of Daytona Beach, is better equipped than many\n\nuniversity programs.\n He was hired when the school opened in 1975, so he was able to plan\n\nthe space and procure the equipment needed to run a proper ceramics program.\n Students who get an early start in Ludwig 's program might spend four\n\nyears seriously working in clay before entering college.\n More than one has been disappointed when forced to make mugs in\n\ncollege Ceramics 101 after throwing intricate teapots in Ludwig 's class. \n\n  \" A lot of kids say that they want to be a pottery teacher after\n\ntaking my class,\" he says, \" but I had to work very hard for what we have\n\nhere at Spruce Creek.\n\n\n  Ludwig came into the ceramics world through the back door.\n After completing a bachelor 's degree in fine arts from the University\n\nof Florida ( U.F.) in 1968, he needed a job to support himself and his wife.\n He was offered a job teaching elementary art at South and North\n\nRidgewood Elementary Schools in Daytona Beach.\n He had never thought about becoming a teacher, but the offer was\n\nenticing.\n The pay was\n\n&dollar;6400 a year, and he jumped at it.\n \" We were living on nothing, and that was a lot of money to me at the\n\ntime.\" \n\n  By 1970, he was teaching art at Daytona 's Mainland High School.\n He sensed the students were frustrated with traditional painting and\n\ndrawing so he decided to try something a little unconventional. \n\n  One day, he \" loaded them all on a bus and took them to the St.\n\nJohns River.\n We dug our own clay from the riverbanks, made a bunch of pinch pots\n\nand fired them over an open fire.\n We brought some clay back to school and started making pots.\n It was so spontaneous and the kids loved it.\n They almost burned the schoolhouse down.\n\n\n  Ludwig 's previous clay experience was limited to a mixed-media\n\nclass at Stetson University.\n\n\n  \" So while I was teaching the kids about pots, I was learning\n\nabout pots.\n I try to avoid showing them how to do things, but still I want them\n\nto see what people have done with clay and how expressive they've been,\" he\n\nsa 've\n \" I want them to feel the impact that a piece of pottery can have.\n I always talk to them about the favorite cup thing: How Mom or Dad\n\nhas a favorite cup, and how upset they would be if it got broken.\n This little clay object, this little materialistic thing can mean so\n\nmuch.\n That 's an important fact of life that a student can connect with.\"\n\n\n\n  He interrupts his conversation and yells across the room to a boy\n\ncoiling a long piece of rolled clay around the lid of a half-finished jar.\n \" Hey!\n Does your mother know you left the house wearing that shirt?\n\n\n  The startled boy looks down at himself, then at Ludwig.\n They are wearing the same orange and yellow striped shirt.\n\n\n  \" He 's the funniest teacher I've ever had,\" Am 've Boye says\n\nquietly.\n\n\n  \" But he 's not just our teacher,\" she adds, looking around to be\n\ncertain Ludwig can't hear.\n \" He 's our friend.\n He gives us the option to think for ourselves.\n\n\n  \" I tell them that whatever they do to their pots, that 's what\n\nthey are,\" Ludwig says.\n \" If they copy that 's what they are.\n If they are technical and precise, that 's what they are.\n Nobody is going to change what they are.\n That 's why I constantly stress this honesty thing to the kids.\n I tell them, 'Don't worry about what you do; just be honest about\n\nwhat you're doing. 're\n\n  Effie Pappas looks up from the lidded jar upon which she is\n\ncarefully applying streaks and lines of colored slips.\n \" You don't just learn about pots in this class,\" she says.\n \" You learn about yourself from the way you make pots.\n\n\n  The students are assigned various projects to be completed during\n\nthe semester.\n Some are specific vessel forms, such as pitchers, vases, bowls and\n\nteapots.\n Others are more ambiguous, such as the slab project that usually\n\nleads to some large geometric shape, or a drapemold project that requires\n\nstudents to disguise their pots so that the original mold shapes cannot be\n\ndetermined.\n More esoteric projects required in a recent Ludwig class included a\n\nteapot that had to resemble a vegetable, fruit or plant, and a \"\n\ncollaborative cup\" where each student started a basic cup shape then passed\n\nit on to a neighbor for completion. \n\n  Occasionally, there will be a project on a grander scale that\n\nrequires the cooperation of many students of different skill levels.\n Every year, for example, they participate in the \" Empty Bowls\"\n\nproject, a national program for which potters make bowls, then local\n\nrestaurants donate soup to fill the bowls to raise money to help the\n\nhomeless. \n\n  Another large project recently undertaken by the students was a\n\ncommission from a local delicatessen owner whose daughter was one of Ludwig 's\n\nstudents.\n He needed 200 jar lids to replace the chipped and cracked ones that\n\nwere covering his table jars of mustard and relish, plus he ordered 48 new\n\nlidded jars.\n The money raised bought art books, videos and a new clay mixer to\n\nreplace the school 's old mortar mixer, which frequently deposited metal\n\nscrapings into the clay. \n\n  Three years ago, during the summer, Ludwig and his students\n\ndesigned and constructed a gas-fired salt kiln.\n After gathering information from potters throughout the United States\n\nwho were using such kilns, they decided to adjust a common design in an\n\nattempt to avoid possible hazardous situations ( such as burns and back\n\ninjuries) in a school environment. \n\n  Although some of the potters using a two-burner Big Bertha system\n\nsaid they were not fully convinced of its success, Ludwig and his students\n\nbelieved that bringing the burners in through the back of the kiln on either\n\nside of the chimney-rather than from the front or sides-would provide a more\n\nnatural draft while maintaining a safe distance between kiln-loading\n\nteenagers and red- hot burners.\n They also included a short bag wall against the side walls-in\n\naddition to the normal bag wall positioned between the firebox and the ware\n\nchamber-to prevent the salt from deteriorating the hardbrick.\n The result is a 40-cubic-foot, downdraft, sprung-arch kiln that\n\nperforms faithfully every two weeks, reaching Cone 8-10 in about nine or ten\n\nhours. \n\n  Spruce Creek is also fortunate enough to have a 36-cubic-foot,\n\nwood-fired kiln.\n Built by Ludwig and his students during the 1985-86 school year with\n\nthe help of former Florida potter George Lowe, it fires to Cone 10-12 in\n\nabout 14 hours.\n During the first couple of firings, the students experienced a few\n\nproblems, but they quickly learned that the loading and the placement of the\n\npots in the kiln were essential to the success of the firing. \n\n  Ludwig teaches a full school year and offers a short summer\n\nprogram on his own time for students who want to learn more or who need to\n\nmake up work, but he still finds time to create his own art as well.\n His vigorous flash-fired vessels and low-temperature salt-fired \"\n\nparodies of pots\"--watering cans that don't water, for example--have been\n\nfeatured at the Daytona Beach Museum of Art, the Harris House Gallery at the\n\nAtlantic Center for the Arts in New Smyrna Beach, and the Albertson/Peterson\n\nGallery in Winter Park, Florida. \n\n  Ludwig says working in his home pottery studio has helped him\n\ngrow as a teacher because he is enthusiastic about making pots and \" students\n\npick up on that.\n I wanted to make sure that whatever I was doing at home, I was still\n\ncarrying it back to the classroom. \n\n  \" The kids understand I'm being 'monest about what I want them to\n\ndo because I go home and practice what I preach.\n I think they sometimes have trouble believing teachers when teachers\n\ndon't practice what they preach.\n That 's not to say those aren't good teachers.\n What makes a good teacher?\n Did he/she get you the information?\n Did you learn that information?\n Were you then able to apply that information?\n If a teacher can do that, then maybe that 's a good teacher.\n But I think they have to go beyond that.\n A teacher has to be a role model.\n So I'm a r 'me model.\n I'm a f 'mher figure.\n I think it 's important that what I say that I do and say is really\n\nwhat I do and say.\" \n\n  Ludwig is a real father figure to his own two daughters,\n\nGretchen and Meagan.\n Gretchen took his class last year to experience it from the outside.\n \" So many students have stayed in touch and come to the house over\n\nthe years I think she wanted to see what it was like.\n\n\n  Last year, his peers voted him Teacher of the Year--the award of\n\nwhich he is most proud.\n \" The best part was walking through the halls and being\n\ncongratulated by students who weren't even mine.\" \n\n  It used to be that kids would pass the word to their\n\nup-and-coming high-schooler siblings that Ludwig 's ceramics classes were the\n\nsmart scheduling choice to make.\n And with each September, the children of the children he taught\n\nearly in his career are appearing almost as frequently. \n\n  \" I'm w 'mking a lot harder than I've 'veer worked.\n After 24 years of teaching, you' 'dthink I' 'dhave this thing down.\n But I do not.\n I want to learn so much more, because I' 'mso involved in my work.\n I' 'mexcited about it, and I want my students to be excited about it.\n I think that 's one of the keys to my success with them.\n I 'm going to be teaching at least another 10 years and I sure as\n\nhell don't want to sit for that long and not progress.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "Although the Victorian period officially ended with the queen 's death in\n\n1901, its political and artistic cultures continue to have an unrivaled\n\nimmediacy for us.\n In recent years, conservative moralists have praised the Victorian\n\norphanage and recommended the Victorian virtues of thrift, cleanliness, hard\n\nwork, self-reliance, self-respect, and national pride as solutions to\n\nAmerican woes.\n At the other end of the political spectrum, university offices of\n\nmoral sanitation issue pamphlets warning young women of date rape that recall\n\nVictorian manuals exhorting young women to avoid \" vulgar familiarity.\"\n John Stuart Mill 's schemes for flouting the tyranny of the majority by\n\nplural voting have been resurrected ( albeit with the typical American\n\nemphasis on race) by the ill-fated Lani Guinier.\n In 1995, a magnificent exhibition of Pre-Raphaelite paintings\n\ntraversed the country, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington is now\n\nthe site of a major exhibition of Victorian painters. \n\n  But most of all it is Victorian novelists who exercise over\n\nAmericans an appeal unmatched by that of any other group of writers.\n In 1996, the Morgan Library organized a sumptuous exhibition of the\n\nBrontes' manuscripts and memorabilia.\n Television productions of the works of Charles Dickens, George Eliot,\n\nand Joseph Conrad ( following a run of Anthony Trollope adaptations) pour\n\nforth abundantly, and films based on the novels of Emily and Charlotte Bronte\n\nand Thomas Hardy, though less abundant than those of the pre-Victorian Jane\n\nAusten, also proliferate.\n The Trollope Society, founded in 1987, boasts as a vice president the\n\ncurrent British prime minister, John Major, and flourishes mightily: in the\n\nSeattle area, where I live, there are three separate branches.\n In the present euphoria, it came as little surprise to learn recently\n\nthat Mary Thompson, who at 120 had become the oldest living American--she\n\ndied in 1996 but did not make the Guinness Book of Records because, as the\n\ndaughter of ex-slaves, she had no birth certificate--was reported by her son\n\nto have followed a strict regimen of reading Victorian novels every evening,\n\nand of having them read to her when she lost her sight. \n\n  The Victorians themselves would have found this strange; they\n\nbelieved the novel was the genre least likely to survive into the next\n\ngeneration, much less the next century.\n The essayist Thomas De Quincey, writing in 1848, shortly after the\n\nappearance of Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, Vanity Fair, and Dombey and Son,\n\ndeclared the novel an inferior and ephemeral genre.\n \" All novels whatever, the best equally with the worst, have faded\n\nalmost within the generation that produced them.\n This is a curse written as a superscription above the whole class. . . .\n It is only the grander passions of poetry, allying themselves with\n\nforms more abstract and permanent,\" that, De Quincey said, could last.\n Mill deemed the novel an inferior genre because it could depict only\n\noutward things like manners and scenery, not the inner man: \" The minds and\n\nhearts of greatest depth and elevation are commonly those which take greatest\n\ndelight in poetry; the shallowest and emptiest . . . are . . . not those\n\nleast addicted to novel-reading.\"\n Matthew Arnold told Stephen Coleridge that he had been offered 10,000\n\npounds to write a novel, but would not soil his hands by doing so because, as\n\nColeridge 's famous ancestor Samuel had said, \" Novel reading spares the\n\nreader the trouble of thinking . . . and establishes a habit of indolence.\"\n\n\n\n  Nor were disparaging opinions of this subpoetic genre limited to\n\npoets and essayists.\n \" By the common consent of all mankind who have read, poetry takes\n\nthe highest place in literature,\" Trollope said.\n \" In his own age, [ the novelist] can have great effect for good or\n\nevil; but we know as yet of no prose novelist who has influenced after ages. . . .\n [ T]he novelist can expect no centuries of popularity.\n But the poet adapts himself to all ages by the use of language and\n\nscenes which are not ephemeral.\"\n Novelists understood better than anyone else that their characters\n\nemerge, in part, out of historical awareness.\n Nevertheless, all of these clever people have turned out to be wrong;\n\nand George Bernard Shaw--who said that writers who write not for an age but\n\nfor all time have their reward by going unread in all times--right. \n\n  Far from being time-bound, the Victorian novelists have\n\ndemonstrated a staying power unequaled by their poetic contemporaries.\n Is this simply because of their intrinsic artistic merit? \" Dickens,\"\n\nsaid Leo Tolstoy, \" is a genius born once in a hundred years.\" William\n\nMakepeace Thackeray, according to Charlotte Bronte, was on a par with the\n\nHebrew prophets.\n Bronte 's sister Emily was, said Matthew Arnold, a writer \" whose\n\nsoul/Knew no fellow for might,/Passion, vehemence, grief,/Daring, since Byron\n\ndied\" ( a reminder that it was the Victorian novelists, not the Victorian\n\npoets, who inherited the prophetic passion of the Romantics).\n George Eliot, whose fiction after Adam Bede ( 1859) was considered by\n\nVictorian critics the standard by which her contemporaries should be judged,\n\nwas described by the luminaries who tried ( unsuccessfully) to satisfy her\n\nwish to be buried in Westminster Abbey as \" a woman whose achievements were\n\nwithout parallel in the previous history of womankind.\"\n But surely all these qualities were as evident to both common and\n\nuncommon readers at the beginning of the 20th century, when the reputation of\n\nDickens, for example, was at its nadir, to be revived only after World War\n\nII, and Trollope was alleged by critics to have \" disappeared.\" \n\n  Let me, cautiously, suggest ( in ascending order of importance)\n\nfour reasons for the enduring--and more especially the present--appeal of\n\nVictorian novelists. \n\n  First, unlike most serious modern novelists, they were content to\n\nthink of themselves as popular entertainers cultivating a warm personal\n\nrelationship with their readers yet also telling them what to do or think.\n ( Until Virginia Woolf, no lengthy fiction was detached from its\n\nteller.)\n Who can resist the incessant direct addresses to their readers by\n\nThackeray and Charlotte Bronte, as in the culminating one of the 30 in Jane\n\nEyre?:\n \" Reader, I married him.\"\n Dickens used the direct address less frequently but was equally\n\nconcerned to make his readers familiar and comfortable with his voice.\n Tolstoy attributed this intimate relationship with readers to the\n\nVictorians' affection for their characters: \" The first condition of an\n\nauthor 's popularity, the prime means to make people like him, is the love\n\nwith which he treats his characters.\n That is why Dickens 's characters are the friends of all mankind: they\n\nare a bond of union between man in America and man in Petersburg.\"\n Thackeray, alluding to the serializations favored by him and Dickens,\n\nsaid that after his characters had been \" boarding and lodging with me for 20\n\nmonths,\" he knew them thoroughly, even to the sound of their voices.\n Those of us who were brought up on the modernist writers, so notably\n\nlacking in a tone of tender inclusiveness, now find the accents of love in\n\nthe Victorians irresistibly endearing.\n ( One of these accents is the reticent treatment of sex, in contrast\n\nto the banal explicitness of many contemporary novelists.) \n\n  We are also attracted to the Victorians by a curious mixture of\n\nthe exotic and the familiar, the time-bound and the prescient.\n If they do not offer us precisely, as Thackeray described the world\n\nof his youth, \" stage-coaches . . . riding-horses, pack-horses, highway-men,\n\nknights in armour, Norman invaders, Roman legions, Druids, Ancient Britons\n\npainted blue,\" they do give us plenty of fox hunting, dowry hunting,\n\nPuritanism, Irish peers, Knights of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, First\n\nLords of the Powder Closet, and Grooms of the Back Stairs.\n We find in Victorian novels a depiction of variegated manners that\n\nour more democratic polity lacks, a class system with clearly demarcated, yet\n\ncrossable, lines.\n We may rejoice in our freedom from the Victorian novelists' obsession\n\n( especially powerful in Dickens and Trollope) with becoming a gentleman, and\n\nyet be entranced by the thickness of social context in which Pip and other\n\naspirants to gentlemanliness pursue their quest.\n Henry James explained his own need, as a novelist, for the Victorian\n\nEnglish ambience in his 1879 description of \" the lightness of the diet to\n\nwhich [ Hawthorne 's] observation was condemned.\"\n Being a young American rather than a young English novelist,\n\nHawthorne was confronted by a negative spectacle:\n \" No state . . . barely a specific national name.\n No sovereign, no court . . . no aristocracy, no church, no clergy, no\n\narmy, no diplomatic service, no country gentlemen, no palaces, no castles,\n\nnor manors, nor old country-houses, no parsonages, nor thatched cottages nor\n\nivied ruins; no cathedrals, nor abbeys, nor little Norman churches; no great\n\nUniversities nor public schools--no Oxford, nor Eton, nor Harrow . . . no\n\nEpsom nor Ascot!\" \n\n  A third reason for the Victorians' appeal is our recognition that\n\nVictorian society, despite its differences from the contemporary world,\n\nconfronted its novelists with problems that prefigure our own: how to\n\nreconcile democracy with traditional humanistic culture; how to create a\n\nhumane existence in the welter of urban life; how to find secular equivalents\n\nfor fading religious faith.\n Foreshadowings of our dilemmas abound in the Victorian novel.\n Lionel Trilling justified both Dickens' alleged \" exaggeration\" and\n\nhis interest in the mystery of evil when he wrote: \" We who have seen Hitler,\n\nGoering, and Goebbels put on the stage of history, and Pecksniffery\n\ninstitutionalized in the Kremlin, are in no position to suppose that Dickens\n\never exaggerated in the least the extravagance of madness, absurdity, and\n\nmalevolence in the world.\"\n Readers in search of early stirrings of feminism will find them in\n\nthe passionate outbursts of Bronte 's heroine in Jane Eyre and Sue Bridehead\n\nin Jude the Obscure, as well as in the intense yearnings of Dorothea Brooke\n\nin Middlemarch.\n Joseph Conrad 's depiction, in Heart of Darkness, of the deterioration\n\nof imperialist idealism into a desire to \" Exterminate all the brutes!\" casts\n\na lurid, prescient shadow on the ideologues of later final solutions; his\n\nportrait of the bomb-carrying \" professor\" in The Secret Agent prefigures our \"\n\nguerrillas with tenure.\"\n In Daniel Deronda, Eliot probed so deeply into the roots of both\n\nZionism and a Toynbee-esque variety of intellectual anti-Semitism that a\n\nstreet is named after her in each of Israel 's three major cities.\n In The Warden, Trollope created in Tom Towers the archetype of many a\n\nNew York Times or Washington Post columnist, issuing infallible bulls from \"\n\nthe Vatican of England,\" and \" studiously striving to look a man but knowing\n\nwithin his breast that he was a god.\"\n In Jude the Obscure Hardy depicted with tremendous sympathy the\n\nintellectual ambition of a self-educated worker to break into the closed\n\ncircle of Oxford, an ambition akin to that of American minorities to redefine\n\nthe \" mainstream\" of our intellectual life.\n If Pip 's quest for gentlemanly status is alien to us, the snobbish\n\ncontempt for his adoptive \" father,\" Magwitch, that results from the very \"\n\nrefinements\" that Magwitch has purchased for Pip is a very American story,\n\nfamiliar--alas!--to countless European and Asian immigrants.\n\n  No single formula can encompass Victorian novelistic\n\nimaginations.\n Dickens insisted that all novelists report their own conception of\n\nreality from their own perspective, for \" we are all partly creators of the\n\nobjects we perceive.\"\n But although perception

{"text": "Jason Sams, in danger of losing his job ( not ready to admit it\n\nwas already lost), deemed it high time to return to the literary wars.\n It was 1976, year of the tall ships, two hundredth anniversary of the\n\nnation 's founding; impossible to ignore ( in Boston, in March) signs of\n\nimpending celebration, but the prospect of pervasive pageantry depressed him\n\nless than the knowledge that his best efforts were unlikely to keep the\n\nEnglishwoman from finessing him out of the job.\n He was entering his eighth year of marriage, father of one and author\n\nof two ( in marked contrast to Fiona, divorced dam of seven, perpetrator of\n\nsix), forty-three and intermittently aware that alcohol had become less\n\nuseful to him than once it had been, at some indeterminate period in his\n\nlife.\n He knew there might well come a day ( comfortably in the future) when\n\nhe would elect to give it up entirely. \n\n  ( And once he returned from New York, where he must venture soon\n\nto talk up his new book, as yet barely on the drawing board, he intended to\n\nput together an extended piece of abstinence, long enough to launch, at\n\nleast, the project that would signal his return.) \n\n  Even the impending loss of livelihood was less disturbing than the\n\nrecollection of how nice he'd been to h 'd in the dog days following her\n\narrival in July of ' 75, when no one in authority had been in town, let alone\n\non campus, and ( fresh off the plane) she'd called hi 'dfrom the Creative\n\nWriting Department office, to which she'd taxied di 'dctly from Logan, and\n\nburst into tears right on the phone in her confusion and loneliness. \n\n  Delighted to be summoned from whatever it was he had been doing,\n\nmoved further when he laid eyes on her ( about ten years his senior, no harm\n\nin that; his cock and he much taken by her earthy, ample, Colleen Dewhurst\n\nqualities), Jason saw her settled into the nearby Howard Johnson motel and\n\nthen helped her, over the next few weeks, find a university-owned apartment\n\nnot far from his own.\n He squired her to neighborhood pubs, gave her a hand moving in when\n\nher stuff finally arrived, and when her back went out he drove her to and\n\nfrom the supermarket in his beatup Valiant and finally to his own house for\n\ndinner, carefully arranging the pillows and extra chair on which she might\n\nprop up her leg ( for he knew better than to underestimate a bad back, even\n\nif she didn't), setting her up in his own favorite chair at the head of his\n\ntable in a manner that recalled to him both his grandfathers, or any\n\nimperious patriarch presiding at a seder.\n His wife, battered by years of proximity to his habits, still wildly\n\nhopeful that their \" new life\" in Boston would bring new meaning to their\n\nlives, busted her butt in the kitchen and turned out a masterpiece, a\n\nflawless novella of a four-course meal.\n His four-year-old son said impossibly witty, insightful things at\n\ndinner, and otherwise ( incredibly) behaved himself, when he might just as\n\neasily have staged a repetition of the antics that had sent John Cheever\n\nscurrying into the night the previous academic year.\n But Fiona managed to ignore the kid and even had the balls to send\n\nthe chicken tarragon back to the kitchen for fine tuning, while blowing\n\nliterary smoke Jason 's way, and framing keen questions about the head of the\n\nEnglish Department and other notables ( to which, long since smashed on his\n\nown Chivas and his own Bordeaux, Sams returned - - callow fucker that he\n\nwas-- keen and humorous and self-compromising answers). \n\n  Nevertheless he drove her home and turned her over to her doorman\n\nin the posher quarters she had found by then, in genteelly seedy Brookline\n\nTowers. \n\n  He remained at her disposal through August and into September of\n\n1975; by late September the bigwigs were in place and the new term began, and\n\nas the visiting star-for-a-year she seemed to have settled in from the\n\nbeginning, socially and pedagogically, for he heard nothing further from her.\n A victim ( all his lousy life!) of misplaced compassion, Sams finally\n\nfelt, by mid-December, her ill wind blowing through the fog, adding its\n\nparticular peril to the boozy miasma in which he passed his days. \n\n  The limey son-of-a-bitch! Himself once the visiting star for a\n\nsingle semester ( filling in for a distinguished drunk who began academic\n\nyear ' 73-74, taught a class or two, then vanished), he was now in his second\n\nyear of discharging the duties of backup person to the hotshot of the moment,\n\na safe ( he had thought), reasonably well-compensated, untaxing gig he would\n\nhave been content to continue for as long as they would have him or until his\n\nship came in, whichever was soonest; but Fiona was after it now, and not (\n\nfrom what he'd further 'dard) from love of teaching or a need for money but\n\nbecause she'd fallen f 'd some West Indian poet putz and needed the promise of\n\na job in order to renew her visa; what could be simpler than to go after some\n\nversion of the position she already held, stepping with Ms.\n Dewhurst 's own terrible grace over whatever bodies might litter the\n\nroad?\n\n\n  Not without resources, Sams primed himself with a few pops of\n\nJack Daniels and a Rignes beer and got on the blower to the New York Times.\n They accomodated him with three first novels to review.\n He was sick and tired of writing book reviews, even ( or especially)\n\nfor the Sunday New York Times, but the point now was to see to it that the\n\nbrief bio accompanying the ephemera contained not only his literary bona\n\nfides but also a thunderous plug for the half-ass creative writing program (\n\nas weren't they all) in the half-ass university that was about to discharge\n\nhim. \n\n  This much unfolded as planned: \" Jason Sams, the author of Just\n\nDesserts, a book of stories, and Slow Dying, a novel...\" was further\n\ndescribed as Visiting Lecturer in Creative Writing ( Fiction) in the Graduate\n\nCreative Writing Program at the University of Greater Boston, and in the days\n\nafter his review appeared the doddering Shakespearean scholar took to nodding\n\nat him in the hallway, and the philologist who specialized in New England\n\nplace names allowed that he hadn't read a novel in thirty years, and Sams'\n\nomnibus pan had done little to alter his habits.\n Surely someone in the administration or at least high up in the\n\nEnglish Department must have seen it too, and too bad his class of six that\n\nsemester was totally uninspired, or he would have solicited testimonials from\n\nsome or all of them regarding his preternatural ability to elicit the best\n\nprose ( fiction) they had to offer.\n But to a man ( and one snide woman) they were obtuse and talent-free,\n\nso he let that aspect go. \n\n  In mid-February the Joycean scholar who chaired the English\n\nDepartment, new to the position and also to the U of GB, suggested lunch.\n Jason accepted, recommending a frugal Greek place in the square, not\n\nfar from where he lived.\n Between the chairman 's invitation and their meeting a week later a\n\nSunday New York Times appeared, and there on the cover of the Book Review was\n\nFiona, Visiting Professor in the Graduate Creative Writing etc., assessing\n\nDoris Lessing at considerable length.\n The Times had to have bumped someone else to have given her the new\n\nLessing on such short notice; holy shit ( if he had doubted it before), was\n\nhe ever overmatched! He thought he might share this rueful insight with the\n\nchairman over lunch, while not neglecting to make his own strong case for\n\nkeeping the job: he was ( unlike the Englishwoman) an experienced teacher of\n\nthe unteachable, had done the thing at Columbia University and at Bard\n\nCollege before arriving at the U of GB, and ( not that this necessarily\n\nmattered, nor did contemplation of it always bring him pleasure) could point\n\nto moderately successful young writers publishing out there at this moment\n\nwho had obviously benefited from his guidance. \n\n  He would of course endeavor to steer clear of the fact ( although\n\nit informed their every word to each other) that he and the chairman had\n\nknown each other for almost twenty-five years, and that the chairman had\n\nwritten a delighted review of Jason 's first book some thirteen years earlier\n\nfor ( of all places) the Sunday New York Times.\n Now married to a young woman who had been his student at the\n\nuniversity he had recently been lured from, father by his first marriage of\n\ntwo teenaged boys he saw every other weekend ( his ex-wife taught English at\n\nRadcliffe), the chairman had aged well, retaining all his curly locks (\n\nunlike the thin-topped Sams), a becoming salt-and-pepper now, as was his\n\nneatly-trimmed beard; had published two collections of scholarly essays with\n\nuniversity presses and was readying a third; to Jason ( who had read all\n\ntheir mentor 's fiction and nonfiction with considerable profit and pleasure),\n\nthe chairman 's work seemed to owe a great deal to Lionel Trilling 's, while\n\nmanaging to sidestep entirely the master 's readability.\n Sams had not loved the chairman, as he still loved a few of the\n\nfriends he'd m 'de way back then, and in fact had not known him all that well\n\nduring their undergraduate years.\n But they had been at Columbia at the same time, shared whatever the\n\nclass of ' 53 had shared, and beyond that were both New Yorkers, from\n\northodox Jewish backgrounds long since repudiated, and so the present\n\nsituation, the chairman inheriting both Jason and his problems, was indeed\n\nperhaps a trifle fraught, as Trilling might have said, although not nearly as\n\nfraught, in Sams' opinion, as the chairman, with his love of complex Jewish\n\nsuffering, liked to make it appear. \n\n  In the beginning, while Sams still attended faculty functions (\n\nfor the free booze, and for the opportunity - - which eluded him always-- of\n\nadvancing his career), the chairman would seek him out and drape an arm\n\nacross his shoulders and say to whatever third party happened to be passing,\n\n\" You see this guy?\n He 's one hell of a short story writer!\"\n ( The chairman had not been enamored of Sams' novel, but neither, for\n\nthat matter, had been Trilling, or the New York Times.) \" We were classmates\n\nat Columbia, can you beat it?\n We even took Trilling 's Austen-Dickens-Wordsworth course together!\n\nAnd he wrote well then! 'Silent Generation' my foot, eh Jace?\"\n With these facts and opinions public record, any temptation toward\n\nfavoritism the chairman might have felt was clearly compromised, and at that\n\npoint, if he judged the company receptive, and even if not, the chairman\n\nwould fire off a brand new Jewish joke, which invariably glazed Jason 's eyes\n\nand strained the corners of his mouth, while he wondered what idle nincompoop\n\ncontinued to grind the damn things out, and how the chairman managed to have\n\ninstant access to them. \n\n  I' 'veknown this guy forever ( Jason heard), and now that you know\n\nit you can rest assured I won't be doing him any favors.\n In these corrupt times, in this city corrupter than most, in this\n\nuniversity corruptest of all, led by an iron-fisted president ( with a palace\n\nguard of wildeyed satraps) who summarily dismisses his enemies and appoints\n\nhis cronies to high administrative posts and what is worse does not scruple\n\nto anoint anyone who strikes his fancy a \" professor\" and inflict same at\n\nbudget-busting ratesd on some unsuspecting department head ( and you may rest\n\nassured I will resign my chairmanship and my position both before I allow\n\nsuch a thing to happen in my purview), all the while shooting off his mouth\n\nwith an incredible mixture of chutzpah and cant about the need for\n\nbelt-tightening and the quest for something he calls \" excellence,\" some few\n\nof us with the means to do so must combat the prevailing tone. \n\n  Jason was with him up to here ( although there were times he\n\nfound himself wishing that the president and his handpicked band of merry\n\npsychopaths didn't scare the shit out of him, and that he and all the\n\npowerful freaks had somehow come to be fast friends), but did such\n\nscrupulosity mean you had to bend way back the other way and give the shaft\n\nto people you knew, whose work ( if nothing else) you once respected in a\n\nformer life?\n Hah, lansman?\"\n Was it so written in the Talmud?\n\n\n  The chairman was an inch or two taller than Jason, and ( even had\n\nhe not been wearing the expensive tweed topcoat) considerably broader;\n\ncouldn't blame him for these physical advantages, but who else was there to\n\nhold responsible for the writer 's weird feeling of being bested from the\n\nstart?\n \" Dutch treat?\" the chairman said as he walked up, ushering Jason\n\ninto the restaurant.\n To the employee it was an ill omen, although he had chosen this\n\nparticular place to guard against just such eventuality.\n This was not New York, he was not lunching with a publisher or some\n\nother seeker after his favor, he would not be starting off with a martini (\n\nwhich he never otherwise drank), getting ready to be courted.\n Would such a wooing, he wondered, ever befall him again?", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1c11abb8-b544-4a56-89f3-77f318d6e8c3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.695016+00:00"}
{"text": "SAN DIEGO - Increased competition for federal funds and a shift in\n\nThe priorities of corporate laboratories toward core businesses dictate that\n\nscientists discard the notion of wholly separate academic and industrial\n\nresearch activities in favor of more collaboration, according to Jean M.J.\n\nFrechet, Cornell professor of chemistry.\n\n  Academic and industrial collaborations can benefit both sides\n\nequally if management adopts an enlightened approach, said Frechet, who\n\nreceived the American Chemical Society Cooperative Research Award March 14 at\n\nthe society 's national meeting.\n\n  \" Could a corporation remain healthy over a long period of time\n\nwithout any long-term research?\" he asked in a presentation.\n \" Would the ivory tower crumble if a blend of fundamental and\n\nmission-oriented research were carried out within its walls?\"\n\n  A beneficiary of fruitful collaborations with IBM, Eastman Kodak\n\nCoand Exxon Chemical Co., Frechet said the best collaborations are those that\n\n\" begin with a handshake between scientists and a true desire to collaborate\"\n\nrather than a legal framework.\n Nonetheless, he advocated that academic scientists establish a clear\n\nunderstanding of the relationship that preserves the ability to publish\n\nfreely, guards intellectual property rights and sets both sides on equal\n\nfooting.\n\n  Since 1979, Frechet has collaborated with C. Grant Willson,\n\nformerly of the IBM Almaden Research Center and now at the University of\n\nTexas, in the development of novel photoresists for microelectronic devices.\n The two researchers and Hiroshi Ito of IBM Almaden Research Center\n\nshared the ACS award for \" breakthrough collaborative work\" that today is\n\nwidely used in the production of dynamic random access memory products,\n\naccording to the ACS.\n\n  The production of computer chips - which are the heart of every\n\npersonal computer - has relied on an acid-catalyzed process known as chemical\n\namplification.\n The researchers developed a similar base-catalyzed process that is\n\nfar less susceptible to environmental contamination.\n\n  They have used the technique to produce chips with electrical-\n\nConducting lines spaced 0.5 microns ( millionths of a meter) apart, equal to\n\nthe highest-resolution commercial chips produced by other methods.\n\n  Frechet collaborated with David Williams at Kodak to produce\n\nnovel polymers with nonlinear optical properties.\n These substances are useful for doubling the frequency of lasers,\n\nwhich changes the color of the beam, or in amplifying power output.\n\n  \" We needed physicists, and they had just the right ones,\"\n\nFrechet said.\n\n  Many of Frechet 's students have spent weeks or months at Kodak\n\nand IBM on this and other projects, broadly directed toward \" smart polymers\"\n\nwith useful industrial properties.\n In each case he has ensured that his students retained the right to\n\npublish all material from the collaborations.\n\n  Without such a guarantee, his students would not have the ability\n\nto publish their accomplishments in the scientific literature, which is\n\ncrucial for their career development, he said.\n\n  \" Our students have to be able to speak freely,\" he added.\n \" We receive funding from our corporate collaborators, but it 's\n\nunrestricted. We do what we want to do within a broad area of interest to\n\nboth parties.\n\n  \" I get collaborators who are top notch,\" he said.\n \" In turn, my industrial partners find that it 's exciting to talk to\n\nbright students with new ideas, and they get insight into problems they might\n\nnot have time to pursue.\"\n\n  Collaborations have produced patents held by the university, by\n\nthe industrial partner or by both parties.\n The outcome depends solely on who had the major role in discovery, he\n\nexplained.\n\n  So-called pure and applied research are not useful terms, he\n\nsuggested. \" We all pursue research to discover new things,\" he said.\n \" Sometimes the discoveries have fundamental value, sometimes\n\npractical value, sometimes both.\n We design industrially useful molecules based on the development of\n\nnew fundamental principles.\n\n\n\n Engineering college makes changes to involve, excite students\n\nearly\n\n  Engineering students who think they are required to take too many\n\nCourses to get a Cornell degree, take note:\n\n  Beginning with the incoming freshman class ( ' 98), the number of\n\nhours required for an engineering degree will decrease, and students will\n\nhave a more flexible, comprehensive curriculum.\n\n  \" The faculty have made the first significant undergraduate\n\nengineering curriculum changes since the current requirements were adopted\n\nalmost 15 years ago,\" said John E. Hopcroft, the Joseph Silbert Dean of the\n\nCollege of Engineering.\n\n  Engineering faculty approved the changes Feb. 28, after more than\n\nthree years of study.\n The College Curriculum Governing Board started to look at the\n\ncurriculum in 1991, as an ad-hoc committee examining the freshman-sophomore\n\nengineering experience.\n It blossomed into a full-fledged committee examining teaching and\n\ncurriculum, and led to the new undergraduate requirements.\n\n\n  Among the changes: Students need fewer credits for an engineering\n\ndegree, 38 courses instead of 40; they will be able to affiliate with a field\n\nwithin engineering earlier in their college experience; they have more\n\nflexibility in taking courses outside of engineering; and they must take a\n\nhands-on introduction-to-engineering course freshman year, exposing them to\n\nthe \" excitement and process of engineering\" early in their college\n\ncareers.\n\n  The changes are an example of the importance the college puts on\n\nundergraduate education, and they reflect changes in engineering education\n\nacross the nation, Hopcroft says.\n\n  \" The old curriculum put tremendous burden on you your junior\n\nyear,\" the dean said.\n \" It 's extraordinarily demanding, because you're just dec 'reing your\n\nmajor in the college and have to take a difficult load of courses.\"\n\n  The new curriculum is less rigid in the later years and more\n\ncomplete and integrated. \n\n\n  For example, the current curriculum requires students to take a\n\nheavy dose of basic courses, such as physics, math and computer science,\n\nduring their freshman and sophomore years.\n It is not until their junior year that they take field-specific\n\nengineering classes, such as those in electrical, materials, civil,\n\nmechanical and aerospace engineering or applied physics.\n\n  One of the problems with that, the dean said, is that\n\nhistorically students transfer out of the college before the junior year.\n\n  In fact, almost 90 percent of students entering the engineering\n\ncollege between 1983 and 1989 graduated from Cornell, but only 75 percent or\n\nso graduated from the engineering college.\n\n  But the new curriculum requires an introductory course in a\n\nfield, hands-on learning lab, during freshman year.\n That will expose them to engineering early in their college careers.\n Then, the student must affiliate with a specific engineering field,\n\nsuch as civil and environmental, or mechanical and aerospace, for example, in\n\nthe sophomore year.\n By the end of their fourth semester, they will already have taken\n\nthree or more engineering courses, one or two of them in their specific\n\nfield.\n\n  Additionally, \" Industry demands that engineers have a more\n\nwell-rounded education,\" said Hopcroft, who took over as dean Jan. 1,\n\nreplacing William Streett, who has returned to teaching in the chemical\n\nengineering department.\n \" The new curriculum will give*them an opportunity to take more\n\ncourses outside their field.\"\n\n  The curriculum also will make it easier for a student to study\n\nabroad.\n The college has an engineering program in Hamburg, Germany, for 22\n\nstudents and is considering starting one in Asia.\n\n  Hopcroft also said he wants faculty to involve undergraduates in\n\ntheir research projects.\n \" We're committe 'reo getting students involved in the research\n\nexperience.\n This is a research university.\n Every faculty member in the college is involved in research and\n\nteaching.\n It 's at the heart of what we do.\n The college encourages faculty to employ undergraduates in their\n\nlabs.\n We have more interest in that than we can finance,\" Hopcroft said.\n Last year, the college spent\n\n&dollar;62,000 from its general fund and alumni donations to finance undergraduate\n\nresearch positions, with another\n\n&dollar;75,000 from the General Electric Foundation.\n\n  \" At some institutions, teaching is simply conveying a body of\n\nknowledge.\n But here, we want them to learn how that knowledge is created.\n We want students to understand how engineering research is done, how\n\nit 's funded.\n We want to foster teamwork and give them an actual design experience.\n Such experiences may include, for example, designing and building an\n\nSAE Formula race car or hybrid electric vehicle, a concrete canoe or a\n\npedestrian bridge to be constructed locally.\n\n  Another curriculum innovation: The college will offer a\n\nbioengineering option for its students.\n Students who major in an engineering field can take a number of\n\ncourses related to bioengineering - the engineering of biological systems -\n\nand will have an official note of this on their transcripts.\n\n\n  Hopcroft also sees cross-departmental, even cross-college,\n\ncourses being offered at Cornell.\n In engineering, students will be able to double-major in, say,\n\nelectrical engineering and materials science for dual degrees.\n \" We're going 'rehave to do more, but with less resources,\" Hopcroft\n\nsaid.\n \" We have 215 faculty now, but in five years we'll have 'll.\n As a result, there will be a lot of cross-college offerings.\n For example, a student can take a hydrology course, but if it 's\n\noffered in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, why should we\n\nduplicate it?\"\n\n  The curriculum is not all that 's new in the engineering college.\n\nThe dean points to several initiatives as a priority.\n For example, the college has hired Gloria Gilford to coordinate\n\nrecruitment of minority students and \" to encourage them to choose Cornell,\"\n\nHopcroft said.\n \" What we want to do is attract the best minority students out there\n\nand to create a campus environment that encourages success.\"\n\n  Concurrent with that, the college has hired Claude Poux as\n\ndirector of the Engineering Minority Programs Office.\n Said Hopcroft: \" We must get the faculty to accept responsibility for\n\nenabling the success of the minority student.\n It 's not enough just to retain them in the college - and this is true\n\nof every student , not just minorities, not just women - we need to launch\n\nthem on successful careers.\"\n\n  Although the college enrollment is about 24 percent women -\n\ncompared with the national average of about 17 percent - the engineering\n\ncollege still must make special efforts to keep women in the field.\n\n\n  \" We need to continue to show that engineering is an area where\n\nyou do interact with people, a field that is important to many national\n\nproblems, and there is value to it.\n We have a quarter of our enrollment women, but we'd li 'd to get that\n\nto one-third.\n\n\n  \" Really, it 's a commitment to excellence that is important,\"\n\nHopcroft said.\n \" In that sense, it doesn't matter if it 's a man, woman, minority, as\n\nlong as they are excellent at what they do.\n\n\n  A member of the National Academy of Engineering since 1989,\n\nHopcroft, 54, earned a Ph.D. in 1964 and an M.S. in 1962, both from Stanford\n\nUniversity, and a B.S. in 1961 from Seattle University, all in electrical\n\nengineering. He also is a member of the National Science Board, the governing\n\nboard of the National Science Foundation.\n\n  Hopcroft was associate dean for college affairs since 1992,\n\nchairman of the computer science department from 1987 to 1992, and a\n\nprofessor of computer science since 1972, when he came to Cornell from\n\nStanford.\n\n\n  Dean: John E. Hopcroft was named dean of the College of\n\nEngineering on Jan. 1.\n He formerly was associate dean and chairman of the Computer Science\n\ndepartment. < \n\n  Agenda: Undergraduate curriculum changes designed to engage\n\nStudents early in their college careers; focus on recruiting and retaining\n\nMinority students. \n\n\n\n\n  The growth of the endowed, general-purpose budget will be reduced\n\nby\n\n&dollar;15 to\n\n&dollar;16 million over the next three to five years, including some cuts that will\n\npermanently reduce the size of the workforce.\n\n  Provost Malden C. Nesheim already has agreed with division and\n\nDepartment heads on reductions of\n\n&dollar;3.7 million for the year starting July 1.\n\n  \" We are not talking about flat, cross-the-board cuts,\" Nesheim\n\nsaid, \" but we are talking about cuts in base budgets.\n Cutting expenses on office supplies for a year won't do; we' 'vegot\n\nto make the commitment to become permanently leaner.\"\n\n  Nesheim, like President Frank H.T.

Parkes' study, entitled Pause and Effect, ambitiously\n\nuncovers the history of punctuation.\n In the culture of the ancient world the ideal of a capable orator\n\ndominated the educational process.\n Democracies thrived on abilities like Cicero 's to present moving\n\nspeeches in the tribunals and assemblies, and teaching was directed towards\n\nshaping a generation of pupils into effective public speakers.\n As spoken language became recorded by the written word, its aural\n\nresponse was stressed.\n A translation from Augustine 's De Dialectica noted in Parkes' study\n\nsupports this ancient reasoning, which was based on Aristotle 's philosophies:\n\n\" For what else do written letters reveal than themselves to the eyes, and\n\napart from themselves, sounds to the mind?\" ( 9).\n Because texts were mostly read out loud, the ideal of a\n\nwell-modulated, expressive, and reflective presentation had to depend on\n\nphrasing by means of appropriate pauses.\n Parkes quotes Ausonius, a fourth century poet and grammarian, as he\n\nadvised his grandson that \" phrasing ( distinctio) enhances meaning, and\n\npauses give force to dull passages\" ( 9).\n\n  This ancient concept of phrasing is the basis of the comma 's\n\nearliest signification.\n The 0.E.D. attributes the comma 's root to the Latin and Greek,\n\nmeaning \" piece cut off\" or \" short clause\", and its earliest use in Greek\n\nrhetoric and prosody is as a \" phrase or group of words less than a colon (\n\nq.v.).\n Hence, a short member of a sentence or a period.\"*1\n Parkes characterizes the comma in this sense as \" usually short and\n\nrhythmically incomplete, followed by a minor disjunction of the sense where\n\nit might be necessary to pause\" ( 302).\n These early distinctions were made by amanuenses who transcribed\n\nspoken language to provide an aid for inexperienced pupils; they were not\n\nmade by the texts' original authors.\n\n  During the next centuries culture began to shift its focus\n\ntowards a value for the written word apart from its dependency on speech.\n Texts were circulated among silent readers as writing became a valid\n\nmeans of transferring information and ideas into an expanded context of\n\neducation.\n The importance of pausing to emphasize and interpret meaning also had\n\nsignificant impact on transcriptions of the Bible and Christian liturgy.\n Punctuation was added to individual texts by individual silent\n\nreaders to insure that they were properly understood.\n By the sixth century this shift in emphasis developed into a concept\n\nof the written word as a direct signal from the mind to the eye.\n Parkes' notes that Isisdore of Seville departed from Augustine 's view\n\nof letters as signifying sounds of things we think, letters as signs without\n\nsounds.\n He attributed to letters the power to convey silently the sayings of\n\nthose who are absent.\n Recognizing the power of the written word to preserve the testimonies\n\nof the past, Isidore created an account of punctuation that addressed the\n\nneeds of new generations of readers; this resulted in punctuation 's\n\nappearance in original texts, as well as its addition to texts already\n\nexisting.\n\n  As punctuation developed in form still based on rhetorical\n\nprinciples of the Ancient Greeks and Romans, so did the marks used to express\n\nand signify each constituent part of a sentence.\n The hand shaped forms of these marks in the Middle Ages varied,\n\ndeveloping no standard until the advent of early type faces in the fifteenth\n\ncentury.\n The comma-mark emerged, so called because it was used to indicate\n\npause at the end of a comma, or briefest clause of the sentence.\n The low-placed semi-circular slip, \" a kind of printer 's smudge\",\n\nsays Iyer in his tribute, first appeared as the figure we recognize today in\n\nthe 1494 version of a type set by the printer Aldus Manutius.\n\n  Punctuation 's use as a \" road sign placed along the highway of\n\nour communication\", says Iyer, has undergone change since literary styles\n\nhave developed as expressions of the times.\n Witness the difference in tone that a heavily punctuated passage in a\n\nVictorian novel such as Dicken 's Bleak House conveys in comparison to the \"\n\nthe 36 unbridled, almost unperioded and officially censored prose\" ( Iyer,\n\n80) that represents Molly Bloom 's private thoughts in Joyce 's Ulysses.\n Punctuation is much more than imposed law and order in our discourse;\n\nits pauses and intervals still affect our feelings and figure greatly in our\n\ninterpretations.\n\n  The power in the figurative definition of the comma, stated in\n\nthe 0.E.D. as a \" break of continuity, interval ( or) pause\" depends on our\n\nknowledge of its origin and extends outward in its impact on literature.\n Shakespeare uses this representation of the comma as a figure in\n\nHamlet as he makes the plea for a truce between England with the lines, \" As\n\npeace should still her wheaten garland wear/And stand a comma 'tween the\n\namnities\" ( V,11,42-43).\n The force that Shakespeare 's comma contributes to these skillfully\n\narticulated lines results in nothing less than the fulfillment of Hamlet 's\n\nmotive - a convincing forgery of a letter from Claudius to the King of\n\nEngland that spares Hamlet 's life from Claudius' murderous plot and\n\nsacrifices the lives of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern instead.\n Much lighter in tone, but still evocative of the comma 's origin, is\n\nthis example from the 1887 text, Poor Nellie, which makes the reader\n\nsmilingly ponder upon the ramblings recorded by \" a lady who writes so easily\n\nthat there hardly seems to be a comma to her mind between any two subjects\n\nunder the sun, and never a full stop\" ( O.E.D.\n\n\n  A contemporary work that uses a figural expression of the comma\n\nto develop its theme is Nicholson Baker 's Room Temperature.\n Baker constructs the life of his main character, Mike, from a\n\nsequence of free associations that he makes during twenty minutes spent\n\ngiving his six month old daughter her afternoon bottle.\n Baker 's technique involves more than listing random thoughts.\n He skillfully sweeps us along as Mike embarks on this series of\n\nmental flights, but he always brings us back to the rocking chair where he\n\nsits and feeds the six-month old \" Bug\".\n His carefully related snatches of experience and recollection are\n\nconnected by this interval in the present, this pause that breaks the\n\ntemporal structure of the story, and it is this pause that provides us with\n\nthe sense of continuity that Baker 's character wants us to recognize.\n We learn exhaustive details - \" every item of autobiographical\n\ninterest - every pet theory, minor observation, ( and) significant moment of\n\nshame and happiness\" ( Baker, 41) in Mike 's life; we learn about his\n\nfascinations.\n\n\n  How Baker gives power to Mike 's obsession with the comma is by\n\nhonoring it as an \" oasis of respiration\" ( Baker, 66).\n Although he does provide us with the poignant reminiscence of\n\neliciting his mother 's tears because he harshly criticized her incorrect use\n\nof the comma in a spirited letter to the editor, most of Mike 's musings view\n\nthe comma to be \" real as opposed to grammatical breath\" ( Baker, 66).\n Breath, that the gods give and take away, provides the key to\n\nlife.\n\n  The vignettes of life revealed by Mike are filled with images of\n\nbreath.\n In one chapter Mike watches the Bug drift off to sleep as she sucks\n\nfrom her bottle; he exhales a \" slow, longish puff of air\" ( Baker, 22)\n\nacross the room to flutter a delicate mobile made by his wife, Patty, and he\n\nrecalls a moment from their courtship with these words.\n\n  When Patty and I were engaged and had just rented an apartment\n\ntogether, three times I heard her in another room making sighs of happiness ...\n possibly overlaid with some relief, or with the fading presences of\n\nbad earlier fall seasons when we broke up on weird pretexts... ( Baker,\n\n22).\n\n  Just a few moments, but many memories, later he blows gently on\n\nhis daughter 's forehead because \" she was going to sleep too quickly, before\n\nshe had finished enough of the bottle,\" ( Baker, 34), and he exclaims that \"\n\nshe made a lovely voiced sigh or hum of exhalation, not unlike Patty 's sounds\n\nin the first weeks of our engagement...\" ( Baker, 34-35).\n This discovery is followed by admiration for her instinctual ability\n\nto breathe through her nose and suck from her bottle simultaneously, it leads\n\nto a discourse on hereditary nasal predispositions, and then to the nicknames\n\nresulting from those different types of noses.\n From there the connections expand exhaustingly; a fascination with\n\nthe Bug 's nostril recalls the \" innocent perfection of a Cheerio\" ( Baker,\n\n39), which conjures up the \" smooth rim around the pistil of the brass pump\n\nhead that you fitted over a tire stem 's valve to inflate it\" ( Baker, 39).\n Next comes a complex analysis that imparts air 's life-giving\n\nproperties to inanimate objects: balloons, tires, and red rubber inflatable\n\nballs.\n Finally Mike returns to the Bug - to her capability of inhaling \"\n\nair 's transparent liters through a pair of miraculous one-sixteenth inch\n\nportals and as a consequence to live...\" ( Baker,4O).\n\n  We begin to see that Mike 's incredibly long-winded ramblings are\n\npulled together with quite a remarkable connection.\n That connection is his daughter 's life; Mike discovers that \"\n\neverything was beginning to route itself through the Bug\" ( Baker, 116).\n Baker 's way of accentuating this connection is to develop the images\n\nof life-giving air, or breath, and to translate them into a figure that marks\n\na transition between occurrences, the figure of a comma.\n Mike 's stories let us see the comma as it plays in his present, his\n\npast, and his future.\n\n  We view his attempt to decipher the sweeping motion of Patty 's\n\nhand along the page of her journal as she forms her commas and expresses the\n\nlull in her thoughts.\n We learn that Mike 's hard-earned achievement in playing an etude on\n\nthe French horn without pause is diminished when his music teacher decides\n\nthat the breath commas are indeed necessary, and we smile when, upon leaving\n\nEastman School of Music, he says, I decided to transfer to Swarthmore and\n\nspend my time reading prose and writing papers, where commas could be stuck\n\nin and taken out without the risk of physical injury ( 65).\n\n  We hear his fantasy about writing a definitive treatise on his\n\nfavorite mark of punctuation - could Mike be the ultimate expert on\n\ntransition?\n We listen to him expound on the origin of the comma as a \" point of\n\nmomentary breath-held stillness between two phrases\" ( Baker, 73), as he\n\nimagines how Manutius, the printer mentioned as setting the comma 's\n\nmodern-day image in our minds, \" resolved the informal kinetics of its\n\nwritten formation into a mechanically graphical symbol, retaining \" all its\n\noriginal expressiveness, miming the extenuating dips of the hand we use when\n\ntaking exception to a point in polite conversation\" ( Baker, 67).\n As Mike works himself into a \" state of reverence\" for this \"\n\ninclusive flip of the pen ( Baker, 67), wondering how it would feel to be\n\nrecognized at scholarly gatherings as the \" fruitcake\" who sees the comma \"\n\nas the embodiment of civilization, as the true 'volute' in evolution\" (\n\nBaker, 76), we sense that he is near his reflective journey.\n He says, ... the Bug herself, whose shape - big head, tapering\n\nextremities - when I first saw it glowing on the ultrasound screen, ... had\n\nintroduced a quiet... moment of retrospective suspension in my life that\n\nelevated the whole undistinguished serial succession of years that preceded\n\nit into something that made sense, something with the unity and introductory\n\nof the first clause in a complex sentence.\n The breathing Bug was civilizing me; she was my comma ( Baker,\n\n76-77).", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7707ec54-7124-4661-81b8-34070e48b0e7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.697734+00:00"}
{"text": "<P>  Information aggregation is a pervasive issue in the field of\n\ndecision making.\n In this paper we begin an attempt to develop a comprehensive theory of\n\nthis process.\n We investigate the use of a penalty function to help guide in the\n\naggregation process.\n Ii is suggested that an aggregated value which violates a given piece\n\nof data is charged a penalty.\n The problem of aggregation can be seen as finding the aggregated value\n\nwith the least penalty.\n We show that logical inference systems are characterized by infinite\n\npenalty functions.\n This implies that deviation from the data are not easily accepted.\n Probability theory is characterized by equal finite penalty costs.\n Nonmonotonic logics appear to be characterized by a case in which we\n\nhave at least two different levels of penalties of differing magnitudes.\n We discuss the relationship between the relevance or bearing a piece\n\nof data has on the problem and the penalty cost associated with it.\n\n\n\n<P>  A problem that is pervasive in decision making is that of\n\ninformation aggregation.\n In this problem one is supplied with information and is required to\n\ncombine this knowledge to some purpose.\n The derivation of probabilities from statistics, the process of\n\nlogical deduction and inference and many types of inductive learning fall\n\ninto this category.\n Pattern recognition, multicriteria decision making and medical\n\ndiagnosis involve this process.\n Artificial neural networks are based upon the aggregation of incoming\n\nsignals to a neuron to provide the strength of the outgoing signal.\n\n<P>  Central to this process is the methodology used to combine the\n\ndata.\n In this paper we attempt to develop a format and a comprehensive\n\ntheory for the problem of information aggregation.\n We look at the potentialities of using a penalty type function to\n\nhelp in this process.\n We investigate the case where the penalty is made up of two\n\ncomponents.\n We show the central role played by the set intersection\n\noperation.\n 2.\n\n\n<P>  Assume that V is some variable whose value we are trying to\n\nestablish.\n V can be a numeric value such as a person 's age.\n It can be a nonnumeric value such as the city of residence of a\n\nparticular individual.\n It can also be a logical value such as the truth of a proposition.\n Whatever the denotation of V, we shall let X be the set of allowable\n\nvalues for the variable.\n\n\n<P>  The process of getting the value for V involves gathering\n\ninformation and knowledge which we feel is useful to this purpose.\n Assume D1, D2,....,Dq is a collection of information which we feel in\n\nsome way convey knowledge about the value of this variable.\n We desire to use this knowledge to help in the process of determining\n\nthe value of the variable V.\n\n<P>  A concept we would like to introduce is the degree to which a\n\npiece of data Di bears on the value of the variable V.\n In trying to establish a person 's age the information contained in\n\nthat person 's birth certificate has a strong bearing to the process.\n If we are trying to determine tomorrow 's sales of our product we\n\nwould say that yesterday 's sales have some degree of bearing but perhaps not\n\nas strong as the birth certificate does on the determination of age.\n In introducing the concept of bearing we do not mean to raise issues\n\nin regard to the correctness or validity of the data being discussed but\n\nsimply how directly it bears on the problem at hand.\n In the independent ( random) tossing of a coin, previous tosses have\n\nsome relevance.\n However, since the toss is independent, the previous throws in no way\n\nconstrains the new toss, except in the fact that the previous throws\n\ncontribute to our knowledge of the probability distribution associated with\n\nthis new toss.\n Figuratively speaking one can envision a whole series of planes.\n The information, the variable V, lies in one of these planes.\n Each piece of data as well lies in one of these planes.\n Some of the data may lie in the same plane as V.\n The closer the plane is to the plane in which V lies, the more\n\nbearing the data in that plane has on the determination of V: of course those\n\ndata lying in the same plane as V have the most bearing.\n\n<P>  One would expect that any reasonable process to determine the\n\nvalue of some variable would use all the information which is available and\n\nthat has bearing on the problem at hand.\n This condition becomes somewhat onerous and difficult to satisfy in\n\nsituations in which relevant information becomes conflicting.\n\n<P>  We are interested here in suggesting a structural framework for\n\nlooking at the issue of aggregating relevant knowledge.\n What appears to be central to this process is some mechanism for\n\nintroducing information with different degrees of bearing.\n Some information directly bears on the problem while some other\n\ninformation bears less directly.\n In an attempt to provide a structure to analyze this important issue\n\nof knowledge aggregation we shall allow the degree of bearing or relevance of\n\na piece of information to the process at hand to manifest itself with the\n\nidea of a  penalty cost  .\n We shall associate with each piece of data Di some cost or penalty we\n\nmust pay if we  disregard  it by concluding as a result of our\n\naggregation process some value for V that  conflicts with  Di.\n In this spirit one way to view a piece of data Di is as a subset of X\n\nconsisting of the values of V that are supported by the data.\n Thus the selection of the aggregated value for V is driven by a\n\ndesire to incur the least overall penalty from the relevant pieces of\n\ndata.\n\n<P>  We formalize this in the following manner.\n For a fact D and any x \" X we let Ci(x.\n Di) indicate the amount of penalty we incur in saying that x is a\n\ngood value for V.\n We shall discuss this function in more detail subsequently.\n The intuition here is that if x conflicts with the data Di we pay a\n\npenalty, because essentially we have disregarded what Di says.\n Furthermore, if we have q pieces of data, Di,...,Dq, then the total\n\npenalty incurred by indicating that x is the valid solution is \n\n<P>  We define Ci to be non-negative and such that if x doesn't\n\nconflict with what Di advises, then Ci(x, Di) = 0.\n\n<P>  Given such a penalty function, a reasonable way to aggregate the\n\ninformation provided is to select as acceptable aggregate values of V those\n\nvalues in X which minimize the penalty C(x).\n Thus if we denote by G this set of reasonable values, then we\n\nhave \n\n<P>  no data\n\n , then for any x X\n\n<P> \n\n<P>  This implies that every element in X has the same penalty value\n\nassociated with its support; thus\n\n<P> \n\n<P>  Thus in the situation where there is no data, any x is an\n\nacceptable solution.\n\n<P>  In a given situation the acceptable set G is dependent upon the\n\nstructure of Ci(x, Di) as well as the actual data Di.\n G is dependent upon what the piece of data says and how relevant it\n\nis to the problem at hand.\n In the following we shall look at the process of formulating the\n\naggregation of data as a function of its relevance as manifested by the\n\nstructure of the penalty incurred in disregarding the data.\n\n\n<P>  As we indicated, in the process of determining V, the term Ci(x,\n\nDi) is the penalty we pay for supporting x in the face of the data Di.\n Thus Ci(x, Di) captures the relevance of Di to the process of\n\ndetermining the value of V.\n An important class of these kinds of penalty functions are those that\n\ncan be viewed as composed of two components:\n\n<P> \n\n<P>  In the above, Ki is some constant, and Ti(x,Di) is a function\n\nmeasuring the degree of conflict between the solution x and the data Di.\n\n\n<P>  We now consider a form of the function Ti(x,Di) that takes its\n\nvalue in the binary set { 0, 1}.\n In this case we define Ti(x,Di) such that if x and Di are in\n\nagreement, then\n\n<P> \n\n<P> \n\n<P> \n\n<P>  It is noted that here we make no distinction about how much\n\ndisagreement there is; just any disagreement is enough to cause a penalty of\n\n1.\n\n<P>  In this section we shall assume that all Ti are of this form.\n This allows us to suppress the subscript in Ti.\n\n\n<P>  In regard to the Ki, we can see this as some measure of the\n\nbearing of the data Di on the determination of V.\n The larger the Ki, the more directly the piece of data Di relates to\n\nthe problem at hand.\n One can view 1/Ki as the degree to which we can diverge from the\n\nobservation Di.\n If 1/Ki = 0, then no disagreement is allowed and Di has an absolute\n\nbearing on the problem at hand.\n If we assume that all Ki are the same, we are essentially saying that\n\nall the data have the same hearing on the determination of V.\n We shall assume in the following that this is the case, i.e., Ki =\n\nK.\n 6.\n\n\n<P>  In this section we shall still assume that the penalty for saving\n\nthat x is a good solution is \n\n<P>  where Ci(x, Di) is the penalty incurred by disagreeing with Di in\n\nregard to x.\n We shall still assume that Ci(x,Di) = KiTi(x,Di).\n In this section, however, rather than assuming for Ti(x,Di) the\n\nall-or-nothing format of the previous section, we shall allow some measure of\n\n proximity  between x and Di.\n\n<P>  the\n\nmeasure of disagreement   \n\n<P> \n\n<P>  In some cases we use [ 0,1] instead of [ 0, infinity].\n If X is the set of real numbers, a possible measure for M is (\n\nx-y)2.\n\n<P>  We need to extend M to measure the disagreement between an\n\nelement x of X and a subset A of X.\n [ equation] has\n\nbeen removed from this section\n\n<P>  that is, the measure of divergence or disagreement of any value\n\nx from a set A is its measure of disagreement with the element closest to it.\n In the following we shall use Ti(x,Di)= M(x,Di).\n The T of the previous can be viewed as a special case of this\n\nsituation.\n\n\n<P>  We recall that we select the set G of acceptable solutions to be\n\nthe subset of the X which have minimum C(x).\n\n\n\n then  G =\n\nS.\n [ equation] has been removed from\n\nthis section, then there exists at least one x such that T(x,Si) = 0 for\n\nall i and hence C(x) = 0.\n Therefore, the minimum occurrence penalty is 0 and only those\n\nelements incurring this penalty are allowed in G.\n\n\n<P>  Consider the special case where [ equation] and Ki = K = [\n\ninfinity].\n [ equation] has been removed from this\n\nsection\n\n<P>  The problem becomes rather intricate because of the infinities\n\ninvolved.\n It is not at all clear how to do the arithmetic in this environment.\n What is at issue is the following.\n While it is clear that, [ equation] on the other hand it is not\n\nclear what this product is when a lies.\n For example [ equation] lies in the unit interval.\n Similarly [ equation] when either a or b is greater or equal to one.\n When both are less than one the situation becomes unclear.\n We can state some properties of this operation.\n .\n .\n Thus the order of the data does not matter.\n ; if [\n\nequation] for all i, then [ equation].\n The fourth condition is our requirement that if [ equation] for at\n\nleast one i, then C(x) = K.\n These properties are essentially those satisfied by the t-norm\n\noperator [ 3] which is used to implement the multivalued logic and operation.\n It appears that the fuzzy logic introduced by Zadeh [ 4.5] is based\n\nupon this penalty situation; infinite K and [ equation].\n In particular the Min/Max operator is based upon the following\n\nimplementation of infinity arithmetic.\n Let and be contained in the unit interval and let K= [\n\ninfinity], \n\n<P>  We feel that a particular choice of t-norm

{"text": "<P>  This report explains the way in which we structured the software\n\nto provide the required functionality.\n We focus first on Argus, the corpus search tool, and second on Ajax,\n\nthe dictionary entry editor.\n We examine, in particular, how the design of Argus and Ajax was\n\naffected by the following requirements: changing specifications, good\n\nperformance, and robustness.\n Section 2 describes how Argus searched the corpus for examples of a\n\nword.\n In section 3 we look at how this feature was extended to permit more\n\nsophisticated searches.\n Section 4 shows how we attached senses to words in the corpus, and\n\nfinally section 5 describes the tools for exiting dictionary entries.\n\n\n<P>  In appendix A, we evaluate how well the system described in the\n\nbody of the report enabled us to meet the goals set out in the Hector\n\noverview [ 1].\n We are not lexicographers, so we have not set our results in the\n\ncontext of related work by the lexicography research community.\n\n\n<P>  Appendix B describes the details of a wordclass tagger for raw\n\ncorpus text.\n\n\n\n<P>  The Oxford Hector Pilot Corpus contained 20 million words of\n\nrunning English text, with SGML[6] markings to indicate special characters\n\nand certain general classes of text, such as headings, signatures, and\n\ncaptions.\n\n\n<P>  For various practical reasons, we decided that, after some\n\ninitial cleanup work such as removing large duplicate sections, we would not\n\nchange the text of the corpus during the course of the project, nor would we\n\nallow the lexicographers to edit the existing text.\n\n\n<P>  As a consequence of this decision, we were able to simplify the\n\ndesign of the search tool.\n In order to search such a large corpus quickly for the patterns\n\nrequested by the lexicographers, it was clear that we needed a full-text\n\nindex.\n Since the corpus wasn't going to change, we simply used the index of\n\neach word in the corpus as a reliable way to identify it; word number\n\n3,467,122 would not change during the project.\n\n\n<P>  This decision also meant that we could afford to invest\n\nconsiderable time in precomputing lexical and syntactic information, which we\n\nadded to as well.\n\n\n<P>  The tool that we built to search the text, and to view the\n\ncorpus, was called Argus.\n In its simplest form, Argus resembled the Unix utility grep.\n However, we needed much better performance than grep provides.\n We also needed richer functionality, such as being able to search for\n\nmore than one word at a time, and allowing various other constraints on the\n\nsearch.\n\n\n<P>  The lexicographers needed to search the corpus and quickly\n\nextract all instances of the target word they were studying.\n They also needed to see the target words in a KWIC concordance.\n For example, the concordance for the word \" stock\" might include\n\nthese citations: at while Dai Ichi would change its stock portfolio this\n\nyear, there wo ought 500 April 2,150 puts.\n In the stock options, BP was the busiest, future.?\n The 250,000 tonne buffer stock, which was bought in a vain a ack\n\nenough to put it in order, and stock and equip it.\n Putting laborious, to carry water or move stock to it.\n When these top-priorit The lexicographers also needed to sort a\n\nconcordance in different ways.\n For instance, they might want to sort it by the words to the right of\n\nthe target word, to uncover patterns of use.\n The following subsections describe the parts of Argus and the\n\nsupporting programs that locate and display concordances of a single word.\n\n\n\n<P>  In order to search for words in the corpus, we needed to identify\n\nthem by determining their boundaries.\n For instance, when is punctuation part of a word?\n In the sentence \" I 'd' 'vedrunk another pint\", is \" I 'd 've\" one word\n\nor three?\n To perform this lexical analysis, we used a parser from Houghton\n\nMifflin.\n We ran the parser over each document in the corpus and stored the\n\nresults in disk files, one for each corpus file.\n ( We stored the corpus not as one large file, but as 276 separate\n\nfiles.\n This made the corpus slightly easier to manage early in the project\n\nwhen we were still modifying the text and the analysis tools.) We numbered\n\nall the words in the corpus sequentially from 1 to 20 million, across file\n\nboundaries, producing a unique index for each word.\n\n\n<P>  The parser also performed syntactic analysis.\n It produced a set of four binary files containing wordclass tags,\n\nsentence boundaries, clause boundaries, and prepositional phrases.\n Each file contained a set of records; for example, a wordclass file\n\ncontained the starting position of the word, its length, its wordclass tag,\n\nand its baseform.\n The Adam wordclass tagger, a separate program, produced a fifth file\n\nfor each document.\n We could not keep all 1,380 of these data files open all the time.\n Consequently, Argus spent a lot of time opening and closing files.\n Caching file handles and the static data from the files helped\n\nsomewhat, but we believe that this disk activity reduced performance\n\nnoticeably.\n\n\n\n<P>  The basic operation of searching for a word needed to be very\n\nfast.\n We implemented it with a precomputed index that mapped words to their\n\npositions in the corpus.\n Most of the search operations were implemented most naturally in\n\nterms of word indexes.\n We found that it simplified the structure of the system to split the\n\nsearch code into two parts.\n One computed results in terms of word indexes; the other translated\n\nword indexes into a file name and the character position in that file.\n\n\n<P>  For performance reasons, we wanted only a single copy of the\n\nsearch code executing: the index was quite large.\n However, we needed to provide service to several users\n\nsimultaneously.\n The index was therefore managed by a pair of servers, shared by all\n\nthe users.\n One server, the Index Server, took search requests and returned a\n\nlist of word indexes.\n The other server, the Corpus Position Server,\" took requests\n\ncontaining word indexes, and returned lists containing filenames and\n\npositions within those files.\n Each server had a front end that handled multiple TCP connections and\n\ncontrolled access to the database managers, which were single-threaded\n\nprograms.\n Both servers were designed and implemented by our colleague Mike\n\nBurrows.\n\n\n\n<P>  The Index Server implemented the search facility, returning the\n\nlist of words that satisfied a search request.\n We discuss two aspects of the Index Server: the scheme for compact\n\ndata representation used for the index file, and the implementation of the\n\nsearch operations.\n The central index file was a sequence of alphabetically sorted\n\nrecords, each containing a word and the list of word indexes where the word\n\noccurred.\n To save space, both the words and the indexes were encoded.\n Each word was represented by the number of leading characters it\n\nshared with its predecessor in the file, and the text of the unshared suffix.\n For example, suppose a document contained only the four words \"\n\npropel\", \" propeller\", \" propellers\", and \" propels\".\n Instead of storing all 32 characters, the index would contain only 11\n\ncharacters plus 4 single-byte numbers, arranged like this:  \n\n<P>  Since the list of word indexes was in increasing order, it was\n\nstored as a list of consecutive differences, so the list 100150, 100170,\n\n100185, 100202 would be stored as 100150, 20, 15, 17.\n Each individual number was stored as a sequence of 7-bit digits; the\n\n8th ( high-order) bit indicated the end of the sequence.\n We kept sub-indexes to help locate a word and its list of\n\nword-indexes quickly.\n A sub-index file contained one entry for every 4,000 bytes of data in\n\nthe index file.\n Each entry in the sub-index consisted of a byte-offset in the central\n\nfile and the word and word index at that offset.\n Binary search in the sub-index yielded a location close to a\n\nword/location pair, from which the index file was searched using the word and\n\nword-index information from the sub-index entry.\n This compression scheme saved us a factor of three in space; each\n\nindex entry in the Hector databases ( words, wordclasses, and so on) took\n\n1.33 bytes on average.\n If the data had not been compressed, each pair would have taken more\n\nthan 4 bytes per entry, since the position values didn't fit in 3 bytes.\n Accessing the disk file containing the index contributed\n\nsubstantially to the time needed to query the corpus, so the compression sped\n\nup queries in addition to saving disk space.\n Even with this compression scheme, the Hector index file required\n\nabout 130 megabytes of storage.\n Although the index representation was compact, it still permitted the\n\nsearch operations to be executed quite quickly.\n To find all the examples of a word, the Index Server located the\n\nrecord for that word using binary search.\n Then it generated all the locations where the word occurred by\n\nunpacking the list of indexes stored with the word. We discuss the ways in\n\nwhich the Index Server implemented more complicated searches in section 3.\n\n\n\n<P>  The Sense Server was a program that managed the sense-tag\n\ndatabase.\n It performed two functions: it ensured that changes were applied to\n\nthe database without any loss of data, and it captured the richness of the\n\nconnections expressed by the sense-tag notation.\n Since several lexicographers could be simultaneously reading and\n\nwriting files where the sense tags were stored, the Sense Server ensured that\n\nchanges were synchronized, and that requests for sense tags always yielded\n\nthe assignments.\n\n\n<P>  In order to represent the richness of the sense-tag notation\n\nwhile making it easy for the Index Server to use the sense assignments, the\n\ninformation about sense assignments was represented in two files.\n One was a binary file, suitable for use by the Index Server.\n The other was a text file that contained additional information\n\nabout words that had been assigned complex tag expressions, rather than just\n\na single, unmodified sense tag.\n The binary file contained the index of the word in the corpus, the\n\nUID of the sense, the ID of the lexicographer who made the assignment, and a\n\nflag that indicated whether there was an entry for this word in the text\n\nfile.\n If the word was assigned a single, unmodified sense, then there was\n\nno information in the text file; the sense-tag expression was just the sense\n\nUID.\n If the sense assignment was a complex expression, then the Sense\n\nServer stored the full tag expression in the text file.\n ( This file was not encoded, since there was wide variation in the\n\nsense-tag expressions, and there were relatively few complex tag\n\nexpressions.) We had originally attempted to manage the sense tags directly\n\nin Argus, without a separate Sense Server, but we finally concluded that we\n\ncould not implement a consistent view of a shared, mutable file using NFS.\n When one copy of Argus rewrote the sense-tag file to record new\n\nassignments, there was no way to tell whether other instances were still\n\nusing the old version, and hence whether it was safe to delete it.\n We found ourselves either referencing non-existent files or\n\nsquandering huge quantities of disk space on obsolete versions of the\n\nsense-tag file that were of no interest to anyone.\n\n\n\n<P>  Argus allowed the lexicographers to use the sense-tagging\n\ninformation to search the corpus.\n The search could either include or exclude all words with a given\n\nsense-tag; for example, the lexicographers might want to ignore all items\n\nthat had already been tagged, or they might want to see only the words with a\n\nparticular sense tag, or the words that had been assigned a tag unrelated to\n\nthe current entry ( to see, say, multi-word tags or just wrong tags).\n Most sense-tag search conditions were implemented by the Index\n\nServer directly.\n The sense-tag assignments were just properties of words.\n When the sense-tag search condition was equivalent to checking\n\nwhether a word had a specific sense assigned, the Index Server handled it.\n However, if the lexicographer wished to include other tagged words\n\nand exclude untagged words, or vice versa, the logic required was more than\n\nthe Index Server was designed to handle.\n These search conditions were implemented by a downstream sense-tag\n\nfilter in Argus.\n The presence of sense tags also provided new opportunities for\n\nsorting the concordance.\n Of the many possible ways of sorting, the lexicographers found these\n\nthree to be useful: \n\n<P>  1. Sort by UID.\n While the UIDs themselves were not meaningful to the lexicographers,\n\nthis was the fastest way of seeing which lines had been given the same sense\n\ntag. \n\n<P>  2. Sort in alphabetical order by mnemonic.\n\n\n<P>  3. Sort by dictionary order.\n The citations were sorted first by the headword, then by the\n\nhomograph, and finally by the sense number. \n\n<P>  The lexicographers could constrain a search by sense tag only\n\nfor the target word, not for a collocate.\n By the end of the project, there were enough sense-tagged words in\n\nthe corpus that the lexicographers wished they also had had the ability to\n\nconstrain a collocate by sense tag.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b76c42b8-f42d-4bb8-b692-27eb74bc1ebf", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.700878+00:00"}
{"text": "The following article summarizes the findings and conclusions of a\n\ncase study that was undertaken as part of the author 's master 's thesis at\n\nMIT.\n Ford Foundation Professor Frank Jones served as advisor.\n The study is part of an overall strategy to develop a National Black\n\nVeterans Network in conjunction with the Veterans Benefits Clearinghouse,\n\nInc., and the Congressional Black Caucus Veterans Braintrust.\n It is hoped that the study will provide a planning, research, and\n\neducational tool to enhance organizing and affordable housing development\n\nefforts on behalf of black veterans across the country.\n Future research is being proposed on a national scale to examine the\n\nsuccess of stitch organizing efforts in order to understand the ways in which\n\nblack veterans cat' implement strategies for community development and\n\ninitiate other self-help initiatives.  \n\n  Eighteen years have passed since the official end of the Vietnam\n\nWar in 1975 and the unceremonious homecoming of Vietnam veterans.\n The unpopularity of the war placed side by side with the civil rights\n\nand Black Power movements made the homecoming and transition experience into\n\npost-military adjustment even more difficult for black veterans.\n Nevertheless, the ensuing years saw black Vietnam-era veterans\n\nattempting to adjust and organize along many fronts as an attempt to create\n\nmeaning and define their space within a landscape of social, political and\n\neconomic upheaval and unrest. \n\n  These organizing efforts and strategies met with varying degrees\n\nof success or failure, but never reached the magnitude of a social movement.\n Many veteran activists like myself have participated in the process\n\nof organizing so many groups, associations, organizations, conferences, and\n\nmeetings over the past eighteen to twenty years that time and space limit my\n\nability to recall all their names.\n Yet, all too often these efforts based on good intentions and 'felt\n\nneed\" have resulted in group self-destruction within six months of\n\norigination, or failed to provide long-term solutions to veterans social\n\nproblems.\n No study to date has been conducted of Vietnam-era veterans'\n\norganizing efforts, particularly those of black Vietnam-era veterans.\n Thus, eighteen to twenty years after the Vietnam War, we know little\n\nabout the factors involved in successful self-help organizing. \n\n  With this in mind, I began the process of questioning and\n\nreexamining the possibility of comparatively studying a select number of\n\nsuccessful nonprofit organizations and their leadership to determine what\n\nstrengths would be revealed regarding their success.\n Two questions for examination were: did military service contribute\n\nto their organizational successes in terms of skills, attitudes, or behavior?\n\nBut more importantly, how would black Vietnam-era veterans themselves\n\ndescribe self-help organizing and organizational and community development--\n\nthe struggles and barriers as well as opportunities for social reintegration\n\nwithin thy community setting? \n\n  Three assertions guided me while considering these questions.\n First, blacks in Vietnam had paid a high price and consequently had\n\nmade certain vows and promises about becoming social change agents when they\n\nreturned to the \" world.\"\n As Wayne Smith, a former Vietnam combat medic, said, \" What ever\n\nhappened to the promise that we were going to change the world?\"1 Second, the\n\nability to establish a feeling of brotherhood or male bonding was a positive\n\nand intangible asset from the war experience.\n Third, Vietnam 's military small unit tactics were tangible\n\nillustrations of how small groups of committed individuals could overcome\n\nmajor obstacles.\n This study attempts to ascertain if any aspect of these assertions\n\nhas carried over into civilian life or been recaptured as a strength or\n\nbuilding block for organizational and community development. \n\n\n  The study examined three nonprofit organizations in the\n\nNortheastern United States: the Veterans Benefits Clearinghouse, Inc,, of\n\nRoxbury, Massachusetts, Black Veterans for Social Justice, Inc., of Brooklyn,\n\nNew York, and Western New York Veterans Housing Coalition, of Buffalo, New\n\nYork.\n These three organizations formed the nucleus for gathering\n\ninformation about successful strategies and tactics involving organizing,\n\norganizational and affordable housing development, attracting specialized\n\nresources, and garnering political and community support.\n Further, the study proposed that a typology or model for replication\n\nexists in these examples for self-help organizing around the country. \n\n  All three were organized since the end of the Vietnam War as a\n\nresponse to felt need in their respective communities.\n Thus, these community-based organizations represent efforts by black\n\nveterans to reconnect with black community life.\n Furthermore, they represent symbolically untapped human resources\n\ncontained in various communities around the country. \n\n  The study focused on examining why these three organizations were\n\nsuccessful when other black veterans organizing attempts were failures; if\n\nmilitary service was a determining or contributing factor for their success;\n\nand, whether these factors or attributes were present in all three veterans\n\nand, if so, whether a formula could be developed based on these factors for\n\nreplication in other parts of the country.\n The study also examined how these factors might manifest themselves\n\nin organizing community-based organizations for community development. \n\n  Over a three-year period, interviews were conducted with the\n\norganizations' leaders: Mr. Ralph Cooper, executive director of the Veterans\n\nBenefits clearinghouse; Mr. Job Mashariki, director of Black Veterans for\n\nSocial Justice, and Mr. Jerry Bowman, vice-president of Western New York\n\nVeterans Housing Coalition between 1988 and 1990.\n These three-hour interviews consisted of categorical questions using\n\nan ethnographic research approach recommended by Dr. Carlos Brossard. \n\n  The study 's principal value is its theoretical veterans community\n\ndevelopment model emphasizing the role played by military service, organizing\n\nand organizational development, higher education, relationship building,\n\ninterpersonal skills, leadership, racial consciousness, and social activism\n\non behalf of self-help.\n In this sense, the study represents a purposive sample and its goal\n\nis simply to give definition to a theory for veterans' supplementing\n\ncommunity development efforts and a model for community application or\n\npractice. \n\n  Self-help offered these veterans a window of opportunity to\n\noffset feelings of need, negativity, frustration, hopelessness and\n\nhelplessness with programmatic responses.\n At the same time, necessity merely sanctioned what had already become\n\nself-help practices.\n The idea of self-help motivated veterans to come together as a group\n\nand strive towards creating long-term solutions to their social problems,\n\nwhile expanding the realm of possibilities.\n This acknowledgment, however, should not dismiss the importance of a\n\ncommunity context. \n\n  The overall goal of the study was to take a new approach to\n\nexamining black Vietnam-era veterans focusing on factors of successful\n\norganizing and development of community-based nonprofit organizations.\n It also sought to investigate and understand black leadership\n\nattributes, rather than fall prey to continuing depictions of black\n\nVietnam-era veterans as a tragic problem group. \n\n \n\n  ( Black veterans are an untapped resource within the black\n\ncommunity; \n\n  ( Community development offers a window of opportunity for black\n\nVietnam-era veterans to become integrated into the community setting; and,\n\n\n\n  ( Homelessness and affordable housing development offer future\n\nareas of potential conflict and opportunity for black veterans; \n The Effect of Military Service on Successful Organizing\n\n \n\n \n by definition is added value or\n\nincrease in human capacity through both generalized and specialized skills\n\nand training.\n The assertion here is that military service contributes to human\n\ncapital formation versus being merely an instrument of U.S. foreign policy.\n Military service provides a modicum of tangible attributes through\n\ntraining, travel, occupational and leadership development, not to mention the\n\nintangible attributes of certain social behaviors, including interdependency,\n\ndiscipline, camaraderie, small-group cohesion, and teamwork, among others.\n\n\n\n  However, the study unevenly reflects the impact of military\n\nservice on human capital formation.\n Only one of the three interviewees reported being in Vietnam and\n\ndrawing on the lessons of Vietnam when addressing present day problems and\n\nsituational difficulties.\n The second stated that he did not think the military did much for his\n\ndevelopment, but then contradicted himself later in the interview when he\n\nnoted that he traveled, experienced foreign cultures, acquired language\n\nskills, and felt for the first time felt he was received as a human being,\n\nrather than as a \" nigger.\"\n He added that he felt this experience would be with him forever.\n The third veteran did not discuss his military experience to any\n\ndegree. \n\n  The study is, therefore, somewhat ambiguous as it relates to the\n\nextent that military service might be a developer of human capital.\n Yet, while the veterans themselves were reluctant to attribute any\n\ngood to their military experience, the study found that military service had\n\nin fact a profound socializing effect on their lives.\n The military as an autocratic organization imposed discipline and\n\norder and frequently aided in sharpening critical assessment skills.\n In addition, it facilitated their ability to improvise more readily\n\nand become more mission- or task-oriented.\n The acquisition of this kind of operational discipline, coupled with\n\nthe veterans' natural talents, proved to be a factor in successful\n\norganizing. \n\n\n  All three veterans' backgrounds are rooted in community\n\norganizing and organizational development.\n All three men built local reputations as political activists on\n\nbehalf of the broader array of black community concerns.\n Community organizing was a springboard for approaching the problems\n\nof black veterans from a self-help and community-based organizational\n\nperspective.\n All three mentioned seeing self-help organizing, social services\n\ndelivery, and affordable housing development targeted towards black veterans\n\nas a continuation of their efforts at addressing community problems at large.\n\n\n\n  In Buffalo, the demise of industry or blue collar manufacturing\n\njobs, the continuation of white Irish political control, and finally an\n\nincreasingly vocal black population precipitated the community organizing\n\nefforts of Jerry Bowman and his founding of the Black Community Information\n\nCenter.\n Job Mashariki helped to organize the East Cultural and Education\n\nCenter, arrange economic boycotts of downtown businesses, and establish the\n\nRandolph Evans Funds in Brooklyn, New York, the city 's largest borough where\n\na large, progressive, and even militant segment of the population, largely\n\nAfrican and Caribbean American, has had a long history of community\n\ninvolvement and political control extending from the local neighborhoods to\n\nthe congressional district.\n In Boston, similar to parts of the southern United States, school\n\nbusing during the 1970s and its aftermath of racial violence, polarization,\n\nand struggle for political control between the white Irish and the black\n\npopulation led to Boston 's being labeled \" the most racist city in America.\"\n Yet, despite this, Ralph Cooper opened the first Veterans Peer\n\nAssistance Counseling Program in the city of Boston on the campus of Boston\n\nState College, co-founded the Veterans Club and the Veterans Benefits\n\nClearinghouse, and after graduation was awarded a Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts Fellowship and field placement at the Roxbury Multi-Service\n\nCenter, one of the oldest and largest social service organizations in\n\nBoston 's black community, to learn the internal workings of a community\n\nagency. \n\n\n  The study found that attending college played a major role in the\n\npost-military resocialization into civilian life and contributed to the\n\npersonal growth and professional development of the three veterans.\n As older students possessing maturity and experience, college\n\nprovided them with an academic and intellectual type of discipline and\n\nchallenge not associated with military service.\n Most importantly, it provided an environment conducive to short- term\n\neconomic survival, learning and teaching, and, lastly, institutional\n\nmaneuvering or manipulation.\n These black veteran organizers viewed higher education, social\n\nactivism, and life-long learning in a positive light. \n\n  The college backgrounds and organizational histories of the three\n\nveterans interviewed revealed certain commonalities.\n All three attended college after the military and therefore brought a\n\nhost of personal resources to the task of campus organizing, academic\n\nachievement, and community activism.\n In Boston, Ralph Cooper and others organized the Veterans Club on the\n\ncampus of Boston State College which was later incorporated as the Veterans\n\nBenefits Clearinghouse; in Brooklyn, Job Mashariki attended New York State\n\nCollege while working at the Veterans Administration community storefront ( a\n\nprecursor to the Vet Centers, the Veterans Administration 's version of a\n\ncommunity-based organization) contributing to community activism, and\n\norganizing the Black Veterans for Social Justice; and, in Buffalo, Jerry\n\nBowman organized the Third World Veterans Association on the campus of\n\nUniversity of Buffalo and later assisted in establishing the Buffalo Vet\n\nCenter.\n While employed at the Vet Center, Bowman also organized and assisted\n\nveterans in the Attica State Prison over a ten-year period.\n His advocacy work begun in the community at large finally culminated\n\nin the development of the Western New York Veterans Housing Coalition. \n Organizational Philosophies: Similarities and Differences,\n\nStrengths and Weaknesses  \n\n  The missions of all three organizations are based on providing\n\naction- oriented responses to felt need, but their resulting success and\n\nevolution warrant further scrutiny.\n This is particularly true of the Veterans Benefits Clearinghouse and\n\nBlack Veterans for Social Justice.\n The immense task of organizing and sustaining organizational growth\n\nand development within a black context and without previous models has not\n\nbeen fully or even partially documented.\n In reality, race and veterans issues are not everyday political and\n\nsocial priorities for most of society.\n Therefore, organizing specifically around black veterans' issues is\n\nslower and substantially more difficult than other types of organizing\n\nefforts, a fact that makes the success of these three black veteran\n\norganizers all the more remarkable. \n\n  According to the study, there are basic similarities and\n\ndifferences in the organizational structuring, staff composition and\n\noperation of the three groups.\n The Western New York Veterans Housing Coalition is governed by its\n\nboard of directors and has no staff with the exception of a project manager.\n The members of the board of directors are volunteers and are composed\n\nof ethnically diverse, social service agency

{"text": "Warning: Recent changes in the retirement earnings test have\n\naffected this publication.\n We are revising it to reflect the provisions of the new law.\n In the meantime, to see how these changes may affect you, click here.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The loss of the family wage earner can be devastating to the\n\nsurvivors.\n This is an explanation of the benefits Social Security can provide for\n\nthe family.\n\n\n  If you are working, the first part tells you what kind of\n\nsurvivors benefits your tax dollars are paying for and how those benefits are\n\nearned. \n\n  If someone in your family has died, the second part explains how\n\nto sign up for Social Security benefits and what you need to know after\n\nbenefits start.\n\n\n  Please Note: This booklet provides a general overview of Social\n\nSecurity survivors benefits.\n The information it contains is not intended to cover all provisions\n\nof the law.\n For specific information about your case, contact Social\n\nSecurity.\n\n  Many people think of Social Security as a retirement program.\n But, retirement benefits are just one part of the Social Security\n\nprogram.\n\n  Some of the Social Security taxes you pay go toward survivors\n\ninsurance.\n In fact, the value of the survivors insurance you have under Social\n\nSecurity is probably more than the value of your individual life\n\ninsurance.\n\n  When someone who has worked and paid into Social Security dies,\n\nsurvivor benefits can be paid to certain family members.\n These include widows, widowers ( and divorced widows and widowers),\n\nchildren, and dependent parents.\n\n  You, along with millions of other people, earn survivors\n\ninsurance by working and paying Social Security taxes.\n Right now, 98 out of every 100 children could get benefits if a\n\nworking parent should die.\n In fact, Social Security pays more benefits to children than any\n\nother federal program.\n\n\n  When you die, certain members of your family may be eligible for\n\nsurvivors benefits if you worked, paid Social Security taxes and earned\n\nenough \" credits.\" You can earn a maximum of four credits each year.\n The number of credits you need depends on your age when you die.\n The younger a person is, the fewer credits he or she needs to have\n\nfamily members be eligible for survivors benefits.\n But nobody needs more than 40 credits ( 10 years of work) to be\n\neligible for any Social Security benefits.\n\n  Under a special rule, benefits can be paid to your children and\n\nyour spouse who is caring for the children, even though you don't have the\n\nnumber of credits needed.\n They can get benefits if you have credit for one and one half years\n\nof work in the three years just before your death.\n\n  There is a special one-time payment of\n\n&dollar;255 that can be made when you die if you have enough work \" credits.\" This\n\npayment can be made only to your spouse or minor children if they meet\n\ncertain requirements.\n\n\n  If you've been divorced, your f 'veer wife or husband can get\n\nbenefits under the same circumstances as your widow or widower if your\n\nmarriage lasted 10 years or more.\n Your former spouse, however, does not have to meet the\n\nlength-of-marriage rule if she or he is caring for your child who is under 16\n\nor disabled and who is also getting benefits on your Social Security record.\n The child must be your former spouse 's natural or legally adopted\n\nchild.\n\n  Benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse who is age 60 or\n\nolder ( 50-60 if disabled) will not affect the benefit rates for other\n\nsurvivors getting benefits.\n\n\n  How much your family can get from Social Security depends on your\n\naverage lifetime earnings.\n That means the higher your earnings, the higher their benefits will\n\nbe.\n\n  If you would like to get an estimate of the Social Security\n\nsurvivors benefits that could be paid to your family, call or visit us to ask\n\nfor a Form SSA-7004 ( Request for Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate\n\nStatement.) \n\n  Within four to six weeks after you complete and return the form\n\nto us, you will receive a statement showing an estimate of survivors benefits\n\nthat could be paid, as well as an estimate of retirement and disability\n\nbenefits and other important information.\n There 's no charge for this service.\n\n Part 2-If A Loved One Has Died ... What You Need To Know About\n\nSurvivors Benefits \n\n\n  How you sign up for survivors benefits depends on whether or not\n\nyou're getting other 'recial Security benefits.\n\n\n  You should apply for survivors benefits promptly because, in some\n\ncases, benefits may not be retroactive.\n\n\n  We need certain information to process your application.\n It 's helpful if you have it when you apply.\n But don't delay applying if you don't have everything.\n We will help you get it.\n We need either original documents or copies certified by the agency\n\nthat issued them.\n\n\n  If you're getting bene 'res as a wife or husband on your spouse 's\n\nrecord when he or she dies, you should report the death to us and we will\n\nchange your payments to survivors benefits.\n\n\n  If you're getting be 'reits on your own record, you'll need t 'll\ncomplete an application to get survivors benefits.\n Call or visit us and we'll check 'llsee if you can get more money as\n\na widow or widower.\n We'll need t 'llee your spouse 's death certificate to process your\n\nclaim.\n\n  Benefits for any children will automatically be changed to\n\nsurvivors benefits after the death is reported to us.\n\n\n\n  The amount of your benefit is based on the earnings of the person\n\nwho died.\n The more he or she paid into Social Security, the higher your\n\nbenefits will be.\n\n  The amount you will get is a percentage of the deceased 's basic\n\nSocial Security benefit.\n The percentage depends on your age and the type of benefit you are\n\neligible for. \n\n\n  There is a limit to the amount of money that can be paid to you\n\nand other family members each month.\n The limit varies, but is generally equal to about 150 to 180 percent\n\nof the deceased 's benefit rate.\n If the sum of the benefits payable to the family members is greater\n\nthan this limit, the benefits will be reduced proportionately.\n\n\n  If you are receiving widows or widowers ( including divorced\n\nwidows or widowers) benefits, you should remember that you can switch to your\n\nown retirement benefit as early as age 62.\n This assumes you're eli 'rele and your retirement rate is higher than\n\nyour widow'(er) rate.\n In many cases, a widow(er) can begin receiving one benefit at a\n\nreduced rate and then switch to the other benefit at an unreduced rate at age\n\n65.\n The rules are complicated and vary depending on your situation, so\n\nyou should talk to a one of our representatives about the options available\n\nto you.\n\n\n  If you get Social Security survivors benefits, the amount of your\n\nbenefits may be reduced if your earnings exceed certain limits.\n To find out what the limits are this year and how earnings above\n\nthose limits reduce your social Security benefits, contact us to request the\n\nleaflet, How Work Affects Your Benefits ( Publication No. 05-10069).\n\n\n  Your earnings will reduce only your survivors benefits, not the\n\nbenefits of other family members.\n\n\n  Generally, you can't get survivors benefits if you remarry.\n But, remarriage after age 60 ( 50 if disabled) will not prevent\n\nbenefit payments on your former spouse 's record.\n And, at age 62 or older, you may get benefits on the record of your\n\nnew spouse if they are higher.\n\n\n  Medicare is a health insurance plan for people who are age 65 or\n\nolder.\n People who are disabled or have kidney failure also can get\n\nMedicare.\n\n  Medicare has two parts-hospital insurance and medical insurance.\n\n\n  Hospital insurance, sometimes called Part A, covers inpatient\n\nhospital care and certain follow-up care.\n The worker already paid for it as part of his or her Social Security\n\ntaxes while he or she was working.\n\n  Medical insurance, sometimes called Part B, pays for physicians'\n\nservices and some other services not covered by hospital insurance.\n\n\n  Some people are already getting Social Security benefits when\n\nthey turn 65, and their Medicare starts automatically.\n Others must file an application.\n For more information, call the Health Care Financing Administration\n\nat 1-800 MEDICAR(E) and ask for a copy of the handbook, \" Medicare and You\".\n\n\n\n \n\n  If you get Medicare and have low income and few resources, your\n\nstate may pay your Medicare premiums and, in some cases, other \"\n\nout-of-pocket\" Medicare expenses such as deductibles and coinsurance.\n Only your state can decide if you qualify.\n To find out if you do, contact your local welfare office or Medicaid\n\nagency.\n For more information about the program, contact Social Security and\n\nask for a copy of the publication Medicare Savings For Qualified\n\nBeneficiaries ( HCFA Publication No. 02184).\n\n\n  We keep personal information on millions of people.\n That information-such as your Social Security number, earnings\n\nrecord, age, and address-is personal and confidential.\n Generally, we will discuss this information only with you.\n We need your permission if you want someone else to help with your\n\nSocial Security business.\n\n  If you ask friends or family members to call us, you need to

a friend or family member to our local office to\n\nconduct your Social Security business, send your written consent with them.\n Only with your written permission can SSA discuss your personal\n\ninformation with them and provide the answers to your questions.\n\n  In the case of a minor child, the natural parent or legal\n\nguardian can act on the child 's behalf in taking care of the child 's Social\n\nSecurity business.\n\n  The privacy of your records is guaranteed.\n There are times when the law requires Social Security to give\n\ninformation to other government agencies to

Smith as Editor-in-Chief.\n This scholarly journal has a wide readership, with a circulation of\n\nover 15,000 member subscribers ( excluding \" pass along\" readers) of whom\n\n11,000 are college and university faculty, 1500 are student members preparing\n\nto teaching in English Departments, and 3000 are college and university\n\nlibraries; over 14,000 are domestic subscribers, and about 900 are\n\ninternational.\n The journal includes scholarly articles, book review essays, and\n\nother features comprising 900-950 pages per year ( excluding advertising and\n\nannouncements).\n College English provides a forum in which scholars working within any\n\nof the various subspecialties of English Studies can address a broad\n\ncross-section of the profession.\n Appropriate subjects are literature ( including nonfiction),\n\nlinguistics, literacy, ciritical theory, reading theory, rhetoric,\n\ncomposition, pedagogy, and professional issues.\n No area is more welcome than any other, as long as the topic is of\n\ngeneral interest within the profession and the treatment is accessible to\n\nscholars whose particular expertise lies in other areas.\n Contributions add new knowledge, challenge received opinion, or\n\nsimply inform a larger readership fo the implications of scholarship and\n\nresearch that would otherwise be known only to specialists.\n An important difference between CE and specialized journals in these\n\nfields is that articles in CE must have a broadly conceived significance for\n\nteaching. \n\n  As in October, I write once more as an individual and not as\n\nrepresentative of the CAS Senate or any committee.\n The newly revised proposal and executive summary answer many of the\n\nquestions I raised in my 10/22/96 memo, particularly my questions 2b, 2e, 3,\n\n4, 6, and 7.\n Perhaps you can help me with one small and two larger questions,\n\nnumbered to correspond to your December 9th memo:\n\n  2. Relation between Deans' memo of 5/16/96 and revised CJP\n\n12/2/96: Your sentence, \" The proposal now incorporates that memo,\" seems to\n\nme too broad a response to my October memo 's\n#1 question.\n The revised proposal preserves the governance structure ( 4)\n\ndescribed in the Deans' May 16th memo item\n#2.\n But the CJP alters and clarifies the credit/transfer policies that\n\nwere so confusingly described in item\n#3.c of the Deans' memo.\n That alteration should be explicitly recognized.\n We don't want\n#3.\n\n\n  While I have always agreed with the philosophical justifications\n\nof the program and, through the clarified CJP, have come to understand the\n\nSociology Department 's \" strategic\" needs vis-a-vis the APR, as well as\n\nstudents' strategic needs for accredited programs leading to jobs, I still\n\nhave one question: Why will the Commonwealth support two programs, one in\n\nCPCS and one in CAS, that are both accredited by the Police Career Incentive\n\nPay Program ( CJP I.A. ? 4) and Massachusetts legislation ( your 5th bullet).\n\n\n\n  The CJP now makes much clearer the reasons for CPCS 's excluding\n\nwhat the earlier CJP proposal described as \" younger students...\" from CAS.\n I now understand that the CPCS students in Criminal Justice are\n\nalready well-along in law enforcement careers and that CPCS 's admissions\n\nrequirements with regard to age differ from CAS 's ( by about 3 years).\n However, inasmuch as the CJP requires these two constituencies to\n\nstudy together in seven core courses ( 21 of the 39 credits), the difference\n\nin the CPCS and CAS admissions requirements becomes moot.\n Why can't CPCS just formally change its admission requirements for\n\nthis program?\n I think you're 'rexing two different \" strategic needs\" here: those of\n\nthe Sociology Dept., and those of the larger institution.\n\n  I realize that the CJP doesn't describe compensation, but that\n\ndoesn't explain to me why the CJP Director, unlike other program directors,\n\nwon't be compensated.\n As for the Trustee Dean, why doesn't extra work deserve and get extra\n\npay?\n\n  You write that the new program is not \" situated between two\n\ncolleges\" (\n#3, 2nd bullet) and that that CJP does not \" introduce\" intercollegiate\n\ncollaboration (\n#3, 5th bullet).\n In other words, collaboration has been going on for some time, right?\n If so, why do we now need a new and complicated administrative\n\nstructure described in the new CJP ( trustee deans and\n\ndirectors--in which neither College 's governance has prevailing\n\nresponsibility and in which the Provost becomes involved in micro-managing\n\ndisputes between the two deans?\n It is this 50-50 arrangement that places the proposed program outside\n\neither college ( by placing it inside neither): besides the seven shared core\n\ncourses, that 50-50 structure brings \" between\" and \" inter-collegiate\" mind.\n\n\n\n  The 50-50 arrangement leads to peculiar situations.\n For instance, CJP says ( good news!) a full-time CAS Sociology\n\nline is on the way; but says the CPCS trustee dean will be in charge -\n\n- so a CPCS dean approves a new CAS hire? \n\n  The five-person executive committee ( CJP could well\n\ninclude both CPCS and CAS faculty and still come under one or the other\n\ncollege.\n\n  The spirit of each college 's governance body presiding over its\n\nown courses and faculty ( CJP concerns might be hard to achieve when\n\nthe 50-50 plan is in place.\n\n\n  Isn't there a simpler way?\n Why not leave the CPCS program in CPCS and house the new CAS major in\n\nCAS under Liberal Arts Dean?\n By emphasizing the proposed CJ major as a CAS major but then\n\nproviding a whole new administrative structure, the CJP seems to me\n\nself-contradictory. You should follow through with this as you see\n\nsuitable; I trust you will let me know if you have any pressing concerns.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3fdef475-28ea-4b4a-8f03-cba972d516be", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.704924+00:00"}
{"text": "Wherein a neutron star invades, destroys, and rebuilds its\n\nneighbor in slavish orbit, betraying itself only by a wisp of lithium. <p\n ASTRONOMERS AREN'T easily surprised by things astronomical.\n They take black holes, curved space, quasars, and many other wonders\n\nin stride.\n Yet Philip Charles of Oxford University had occasion to be nonplussed\n\nduring a recent astronomy meeting.\n He had just finished giving a talk on a fairly unspectacular\n\nsubject--the lithium content of certain X-ray-emitting star pairs--when he\n\nwas buttonholed by Philipp Podsiadlowski of Cambridge University.\n Podsiadlowski pointed out that Charles may inadvertently have found\n\nthe first evidence that a superdense neutron star can plunge to the core of a\n\ngiant neighbor, disrupting that star 's nuclear furnace and causing its vast\n\natmosphere to drift off into space, where the gas would clump together again\n\ninto a new and smaller star in orbit around the neutron-star invader.\n\n\n  As it turns out, he wasn't just daydreaming, and the weird\n\nscenario he described wasn't entirely his invention.\n Some 20 years ago astrophysicists Kip Thorne of Caltech and Anna\n\nZytkow of Cambridge proposed that a neutron star that started out in orbit\n\naround a red giant might eventually sink to the giant 's core.\n Although a neutron star is only ten miles or so across, its\n\ngravitational pull is so strong that it could draw matter away from its huge\n\nbut more diffuse companion.\n In the process, it would slow down, like a ship dragging an anchor.\n Eventually the neutron star, in an ever-shrinking orbit, would plow\n\ninto the outer layers of its neighbor.\n After a few thousand years it would spiral down into the star 's\n\ncenter, demolishing the existing stellar core but leaving the rest of the\n\nstar essentially intact.\n A red giant that has been violated in this way has come to be called\n\na Thorne-Zytkow object--even though no one has ever seen one.\n\n  Charles wasn't looking for one, either.\n Indeed, he was studying objects that are in some sense the opposite\n\nof Thorne-Zytkows: X-ray binaries.\n Instead of a neutron star orbiting a red giant, an X-ray binary is\n\nbelieved to consist of a small ( sun-size) star orbiting either a neutron\n\nstar or that other species of massive invisible body, a black hole.\n As the massive object pulls material off its small companion, the\n\nmaterial gets so hot that it emits bursts of X-rays.\n \" I was studying these systems because they contain our best\n\nblack-hole candidates,\" says Charles.\n\n  While looking at the spectra of several X-ray binaries, Charles\n\nfound that they all contained unusually high amounts of the element lithium.\n This was unexpected: lithium is usually destroyed in nuclear\n\nreactions deep within a star, and so the characteristic wavelength of light\n\nit emits doesn't show up in the star 's spectrum.\n\n\n  But the presence of lithium made immediate sense to\n\nPodsiadlowski, a theoretician who has thought a lot about Thorne-Zytkow\n\nobjects.\n He thinks what Charles has been studying are not the T-Z objects\n\nthemselves but star systems that are descended from them.\n\n\n  Once a neutron star sinks to the center of a red giant to form a\n\nThorne-Zytkow object, says Podsiadlowski, the physics of the star changes\n\ndramatically.\n Most stars have a large, hot core where energy-producing fusion\n\nreactions occur.\n Above this burning zone is a convective layer where hot gases rise,\n\ncool, and then sink back toward the core.\n A Thorne-Zytkow object, however, has at its center a ten-mile-wide\n\nneutron star rather than a core thousands of miles across.\n Nuclear fusion still occurs in the hybrid--matter falling into the\n\nneutron star gets compressed and heated enough--but only in a thin shell\n\naround the neutron star, at the bottom of the convective layer.\n\n  According to Podsiadlowski, the different locus of burning in a\n\nThorne-Zytkow object explains why Charles saw his lithium.\n Although lithium is a normal by-product of fusion reactions in stars,\n\nin most stars high-speed protons in the core slam into the lithium atoms and\n\ntransform them into beryllium ( which later breaks down into helium).\n But in a Thorne-Zytkow object, Podsiadlowski says, fusion actually\n\ntakes place in the bottom layer of the convective zone, which allows some\n\nlithium to escape before it can be converted into beryllium.\n Rising gases carry it to the outer layers of the star, where it\n\nbecomes visible.\n\n  Eventually the feeble fusion reactor inside a Thorne-Zytkow\n\nobject fails altogether, and the hybrid can no longer withstand its own\n\ngravity.\n The outer envelope of the star collapses like a pricked balloon, and\n\npart of it forms a lithium-enriched disk around the neutron star.\n Some of the matter in the disk, says Podsiadlowski, might coalesce\n\ninto a second-generation star in orbit around the neutron star, much the way\n\nplanets coalesced around our sun.\n The born-again star might then begin losing matter to its dense\n\nneighbor again--resulting in just the sort of X-ray-emitting, lithium-rich\n\nbinary that Charles observed.\n\n  One great virtue of Podsiadlowski 's theory, convoluted and\n\noutlandish as it sounds, is that it offers an explanation of where X-ray\n\nbinaries come from.\n Astronomers have had a hard time explaining how the small companion\n\nin an X-ray binary could have survived while its larger neighbor exploded as\n\na supernova, which is the only way to make a neutron star.\n ( A neutron star is the dense remnant of the exploded star 's core.)\n In Podsiadlowski 's scenario, the companion starts out as a red giant\n\nso large it can withstand a nearby supernova explosion.\n Only when it is later invaded by the neutron star does the giant die,\n\nto be reborn later in smaller form.\n\n  Charles himself does not buy Podsiadlowski 's theory.\n He has a less colorful explanation for the excess lithium: some of\n\nthe X-rays emitted by matter falling onto the neutron star, he says, strike\n\nincoming carbon and nitrogen atoms, splitting them into lighter elements,\n\nincluding lithium.\n But Charles admits that this explanation \" ignores the question of\n\nhow the damned things\"--the X-ray binaries, that is--\"formed in the first\n\nplace.\n\n  Thorne-Zytkow objects should forge a variety of strange elements\n\nbesides lithium, and if Podsiadlowski is right, astronomers might be able to\n\ndetect those other elements in X-ray binaries too.\n Until then Podsiadlowski may have trouble making a lot of converts to\n\nhis theory.\n \" It 's certainly speculative, and many astronomers may find it too\n\nspeculative or exotic,\" he says.\n \" However, what you see is often more exotic than anything you've\n\nev 'vethought about.\"\n\n\n As federal and Montana state officials wrangle, the Park Service\n\nbecomes an unwilling accomplice in the slaughter of Yellowstone 's bison.\n\n\n\n  While Old Faithful may be the icon of Yellowstone National Park\n\nand first on visitors' must-see list, wildlife--grizzly bears, elk, wolves,\n\nand bison--is a close second.\n Bison--cows grazing with their cinnamon colored calves on cool, green\n\nmeadows, bulls bellowing during the fall rut in Hayden Valley or warming\n\nthemselves on thermal-spring mounds in winter-- stir the soul.\n\n  Not surprisingly, then, the shooting and slaughter of more than\n\n1,000 of these majestic animals last winter made national news.\n Media accounts, which blamed insufficient winter habitat, a disease\n\ncalled brucellosis, and competing human interests, did little to improve\n\npublic understanding of the situation.\n\n  Within any given year, bison populations, just like any wildlife\n\npopulation, increase each spring when young are born and decrease throughout\n\nthe summer, fall, and winter, as a result of natural mortality.\n The bisons' numbers naturally fluctuate from one year to the next as\n\nwell, regulated by weather, forage, and predation.\n\n  Over the years, the Park Service 's policies have swung from\n\nintense population management to nearly none at all.\n Today, the policy has evolved toward \" natural regulation\"--allowing\n\necosystems to operate with as little human influence as possible.\n This philosophy recognizes that while Yellowstone ( and other parks)\n\nis not pristine, the ecosystem is as complete as is possible in today 's\n\nworld.\n\n  Unfortunately, even at 2.2 million acres of land, Yellowstone\n\naffords limited winter habitat for its wildlife.\n Bison and other large mammals, therefore, migrate outside the park\n\nonto adjoining Forest Service and private ranch lands, staying sometimes into\n\nthe spring to calve.\n\n  Last winter proved especially harsh in Yellowstone.\n Heavier-than-normal snowfall before Christmas was followed by several\n\ndays of rain around New Year.\n The rain saturated the snow, and the subsequent normal subzero\n\ntemperatures created a layer of ice as much as a foot-and-a-half thick over\n\nmost of the park.\n Bison and other grazing animals could not penetrate the ice in their\n\nquest for forage.\n\n  Exiting the park in unprecedented numbers to seek accessible\n\nwinter forage, the bison fell prey to the grisly provisions of an Interim\n\nManagement Plan, designed to protect cattle from the threat of\n\nbrucellosis.\n\n  Brucellosis is a disease affecting bison, elk, and cattle.\n It was first discovered in Yellowstone National Park in 1917; about\n\n40 percent of the park 's bison now test positive to exposure to the brucella\n\norganism, as does a lower percentage of elk.\n In cattle, the disease causes cows to abort their first calf, and\n\nranchers, the Montana Department of Livestock ( DOL), and hence, the governor\n\nof Montana, are concerned that bison may transmit it to domestic\n\nlivestock.\n\n  While it has been documented in experimental confinement, such\n\ntransmission has never been demonstrated in the wild.\n In the Jackson Hole, Wyoming area, cattle intermingle on summer\n\nranges and national forest lands with elk, up to 70 percent of which carry\n\nthe organism.\n Ranchers there have vaccinated their livestock against brucellosis\n\nfor several decades, but the vaccines are just 65 percent effective.\n Nonetheless, there have been no reports of brucellosis being\n\ntransmitted from elk to cattle.\n\n  However, a small herd of bison in the area that had tested\n\nnegative in two different years in the mid-1980s recently tested positive for\n\nbrucellosis.\n The only reasonable explanation is that the disease was transmitted\n\nto bison from the infected elk.\n\n  Given the uncertainty surrounding transmissibility, ranchers near\n\nYellowstone 's northern and western borders do not want to risk infection.\n In response to their concerns, the Park Service for several years has\n\nbeen working toward a solution, through negotiations with the state of\n\nMontana.\n An environmental impact statement ( EIS) and a long-term plan have\n\nbeen in the works by the Park Service, the U.S.\n Forest Service, and the Montana departments of Livestock and Fish,\n\nWildlife and Parks for a longtime- probably far too long.\n\n  In 1995, while the review of the draft EIS was out for public\n\ncomment, the state of Montana filed suit against the National Park Service\n\nand the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS).\n APHIS had threatened to revoke Montana 's brucellosis-free status\n\nwhile bison from a herd exposed to brucellosis were allowed to cross park\n\nboundaries into Montana.\n\n  A court-approved settlement called for an interim plan and a\n\nlong-term plan.\n The interim plan, now in effect, mandates: the sanction of bison on\n\nfederal land where there is no livestock; bison that have left the park at\n\nWest Yellowstone are to be captured and tested, with those testing positive\n\nfor brucella antibodies sent to slaughter and negative-testing, non-pregnant\n\nbison released onto public land; and the Park Service capture of and delivery\n\nto the DOL for slaughter any bison near the park 's north entrance that cannot\n\nbe prevented from straying onto adjoining private lands.\n\n  Under the provisions of the interim plan, this winter and spring\n\nnear the north entrance to the park, 464 bison were captured and sent to\n\nslaughter, 261 were shot by the Montana DOL, and 107 that tested negative\n\nwere corralled by NPS and recently released back into the park.\n Near West Yellowstone, 48 bison were captured and sent to slaughter,\n\nwhile another 310 were shot by Montana DOL.\n\n  The settlement, in essence, has made an unwilling partner of the\n\nNational Park Service in a management program that runs counter to its\n\nmission, beliefs, and policies.\n The basis for the management program lacks scientific support, yet it\n\nappears to be the only course for working toward the Yellowstone bison 's\n\nlong-term protection.\n\n  Meanwhile, that long-term planning process and the EIS ( which\n\nwill evaluate a range of alternatives) have been restarted, and according to\n\nthe settlement agreement, the draft EIS is to be available for public review\n\nand comment by the end of July.\n\n  The National Park Service believes that solutions exist.\n Some aspects of the problem can be resolved quickly, and some will\n\ntake a number of years.\n\n  For starters, given that the real risk of brucellosis\n\ntransmission from bison to cattle is relatively low, there should be an\n\nincreased level of tolerance for bison migrating to winter habitat on public\n\nlands outside the park.\n\n  Because the Park Service does not want to increase any real risk\n\nof bison-to-cattle brucellosis transmission, it supports the establishment of\n\na hunt for a portion of the bison that migrate outside of the park.\n Montana already has such hunts for elk, deer, antelope, moose,\n\nbighorn sheep, and other species.\n Wyoming 's bison program, instituted in 1996, is a successful model.\n The solution must also address elk that carry the disease and would\n\nmost likely re-infect bison even if the disease were eliminated from their\n\nnumbers.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "This paper argues that postmodernism represents a contemporary\n\nmanifestation of a long-standing political despair among Western\n\nintellectuals.\n It shows commonality with various \" Power-conflict\" perspectives of\n\nthe past, as well as associated connections with well-known theses of \" Post-\n\nindustrialism.\"\n The strength of the postmodernism partly rests on gaps in Marxist\n\nhistorical theory.\n In its identification of several g stance of postmodernism the end,\n\nhowever, the fundamental fails because of its dematerialization of symbols\n\nand their exchange.\n Postmodern social theory is thus understood as no more than a mode of\n\nIdealist philosophy, a status that renders it essentially useless as a basis\n\nfor social change and that places it in the camp of political reaction. \n\n  Much of the Marxist critique of postmodernism has been refutory in\n\nits intent.\n The remainder has searched for emancipatory sub-texts within the\n\nlargely reactionary text of its major proponents ( see Rosenau [ 19921 for a\n\ncomprehensive, ordered list of various Marxist responses to the encounter\n\nwith postmodernism).\n Both these approaches are limited in their ability to generate an\n\nadequate understanding of postmodernism as a phenomenon per se and, yet more\n\nproblematic for Marxist theory, are insufficient as an analysis of the\n\nchanging social and political reality from which this complex ideational\n\noutcropping has emerged.\n Although there have been a number of attempts to situate\n\npostmodernism in a class-historical conjuncture ( see Norris [ 19901 for an\n\ninteresting exam le), these have tended to cede the home-court advantage to\n\npostmodernism.\n That is, the conceptual assertions of postmodernism have been parsed\n\nfor their internal consistency and thus have been treated as linguistic\n\nevents exhibiting legitimacy from the outset, rather than being examined as\n\nideological outcroppings of an underlying social reality that may or may not\n\nfunction as postmodernism portrays it.\n More simply and in the main, Marxists have evaluated postmodernism\n\ntextually, not scientifically.\n While this is perfectly acceptable and consistent from the\n\ndeconstructive, text-centered stance of postmodernism, it is unacceptable and\n\ninconsistent from a materialist position.\n It is thus a recapitulation of the error of the Young Hegelian\n\ncriticism of religion and theology as modes of Idealism that Marx criticized\n\nin  Toward a Critique of Hegel 's \" Philosophy of Right\"  - i.e., the\n\nconcentration on the \" aroma\" of the socially problematic, rather than social\n\ncontradictions themselves.\n Unless one posits that the word precedes reality, which neither\n\nMarxism nor any other form of materialism does, the referential meaning of\n\nwords must be subject to intense scrutiny.\n Indeed, the primary vulnerability of postmodernism is to materialism\n\nin general, and only secondarily and by inheritance to Marxism, as its most\n\ndeveloped incarnation.\n As Baudrillard ( 1975) clearly understood in ideological practice in\n\n The Mirror of Production  , the levers by which Marxism can most\n\neffectively be \" deprivileged\" as a universal mode of discourse are not\n\nphilosophical, but rather anthropological and psychological.\n However, by agreeing to join the battle on this terrain,\n\nBaudrillard-and by extension postmodernism in general- exposes its own\n\nconcepts to empirical evaluation. \n\n  Postmodernism, at its root, contains an ontological base with\n\nembedded arguments about the nature of reality, even though it chooses to\n\nproceed mostly by means of epistemological critique.\n Although this realization may be difficult to draw out in the\n\nhumanities, and especially in aesthetics ( and while the dichotomy between\n\nthe philosophically reconstructed antinomies of ontology and epistemology is\n\nitself arguably false and ideological in nature), penetration of the\n\nconceptual and terminological fog behind which postmodernism maneuvers should\n\nnot be as daunting in the domain of the analysis of social relations.\n However these relations are organized, they exist as objects beyond\n\nsystems of self-reference, even if their perception is hopelessly recurved on\n\ntheir existence, as postmodernists of the orthodox literary persuasion seem\n\nto believe.\n In sum, rather than seeking internal contradictions in the carefully\n\ncrafted, terminologically crenelated conceptual edifice of postmodernism-that\n\nis, instead of deconstructing deconstructionism- materialist criticism should\n\nquestion whether postmodernism 's conceptual basis is empirically true.\n Further, in this context, truth should be construed in its\n\ncommonsensical meaning of a direct correspondence between utterance and\n\nreferent.\n It is only after addressing such empirical questions that the matter\n\nof the \" class\" truth of postmodernism can be confronted, i.e., its \n\nsignificance for political practice.  \n\n  It will also be illuminating to note at subsequent points in this\n\ndiscussion that Marx 's own text anticipates just such developments as\n\npostmodernism, as it will be to note the evolution of Althusser 's \"\n\nphilosophical\" interventions as they emerged co-temporally with the formative\n\ntexts of postmodernism.\n After this contextual grounding, it will be possible to place\n\npostmodernism in a larger paradigmatic genealogy and then understand its\n\nmeaning for materialist political practice.\n This analysis will end with the assignment of postmodernism to an\n\nideological nexus situated at the juncture of hypermature imperialism and the\n\ntotal alienation of \" actually-existing\" human beings of the present.\n Perhaps ironically, both the structure of Baudrillard 's arguments, as\n\nwell as his empirical observations, will facilitate this operation. \n\n\n  In an earlier paper ( Wenger, 1991), I argued that the essence of\n\npostmodernism was located in its socio-political origin: the despairing post-\n\n1968 leftist North Atlantic intelligentsia denied its allegedly rightful turn\n\nat the levers of history.\n This resentment was enlarged by-and festered as a result of-its\n\nattribution to the perceived fecklessness of that class that had formerly\n\nbeen held by most \" revolutionary\" intellectuals to be the emancipatory\n\nsubject of history: the proletariat of the advanced capitalist societies.\n Both Wakefield ( 1990) and Bauman ( 1988) agree-with different\n\nsentiments-that contemporary postmortem social theory, particularly that of\n\nBaudrillard, has its ideological taproot in the rebuff of the political\n\nleadership of leftist intellectuals by the proletariat during and after the\n\nEvents of May 1968.\n The obvious implication is that this theoretical outcropping\n\nrepresents a retaliatory political response by means of theoretical\n\nexplanation.\n In any event, it is not, nor should it have been, surprising that the\n\npolitical denouement of the aborted \" eruption of Eros\" of 1968, to use\n\nKatsiaficas' ( 1987) construction, would produce theoretical disarray of\n\nprodigious dimensions at the Sorbonne, and in similar venues in Europe and\n\nNorth America.\n Over the following decade, which Elliott ( Althusser, 1990:xx)\n\nbrackets in French political history with the defeat of the French Union of\n\nthe Left in 1978, but which also included on a broader front Nixon, Chile,\n\nKent/Jackson State, and myriad other disasters for the international\n\nproletariat and its sympathizers, the postmortem project unfolded and\n\nestablished itself where formerly only almost-communards and near-communists\n\nheld theoretical sway.\n However, to plumb the conjunctural origins of a theoretical tendency,\n\nand even to assign it its proper political valence, is not necessarily to\n\nnegate its errors, nor to learn from them.\n In the present instance, postmodernism will be seen not only in its\n\nhistorical uniqueness, but as a mode of a much longer-standing reactionary\n\nproject, with which it shares scientific defects, as well as having developed\n\nits own. \n\n  Having stated the above. some cautionary notes are in order.\n One difficulty is that it is somewhat dubious to make assertions\n\nabout postmodernism in general.\n Although the nature of postmortem analysis makes it difficult to find\n\na seminal text in the tradition that does not make aesthetics, philosophy,\n\nand social theory a unified endeavor, and while the common source of this\n\ntradition goes back to Nietzsche and even beyond, there are at least two\n\ndifferent citation \" streams\" that seem to have appeared in recent years and\n\nflow by different paths through the fine arts and humanities on the one hand,\n\nand the social sciences on the other.\n Sociology of\n\nPostmodernism  there is no mention at all of Paul De Man, and in\n\nRosenau 's ( 1992:156-57) reader 's guide,  Post-modernism and the Social\n\nSciences  , other than in De Man 's role as an importer of Derrida 's\n\nconcepts, it is only the controversy around his politics that is discussed.\n Therefore, in its current state, postmodernism 's intervention in\n\nsocial theory/science should be seen as drawing on a limited wellspring,\n\nmostly composed of the work of Foucault, Lyotard, and Baudrillard.\n , opines on why\n\nBourdieu should be included in this company, but this presents serious\n\nreconstructive difficulties.)\n While the somewhat more mediated impact of Derrida and others cannot\n\nbe ignored, the three listed above have most frequently engaged the attention\n\nof explicitly social theorists, with the last two of greatest significance\n\nfor those functioning within the Marxist paradigm.\n The reason for this is fairly obvious, in that Lyotard and BaudriBard\n\ndeploy Marx 's own conceptual repertoire to \" de-privilege\" his own \" grand\n\nnarrative.\"\n Therefore, the main focus here will be on those Bourdieu calls the \"\n\npopes\" of post-modernism. \n\n \n\n, Jameson ( 1984:vii) places postmodernism in the context of an overall\n\nmovement toward models of a post-capitalist society.\n He links Lyotard to Guy Debord, the Situationist, in this regard, as\n\nwell as comparing his ideas to those of Henri Lefebvre.\n However, he also mentions theories of post-industrialism, as\n\nexpounded by Daniel Bell.\n This is the more suggestive comparison.\n While Lefebvre can certainly be seen as having taken a critical\n\nstance toward existing social relations for the purpose of transforming them,\n\nand, whatever else might be said of Debord, his radical critique of the\n\nsocial relations of advanced capitalism has an emancipatory bent, what is to\n\nbe made of Bell, the proponent of the \" end of ideology\"\"\n In the context of postmodernism, what of Bell 's ( 1976) arguments in\n\nThe  Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism  , to the effect that the\n\ncritical, modernist tendencies of the core capitalist societies are\n\ncounter-systemic, counter-cultural, and counter-productive? \n\n  It is arguable that Jameson is wrong in this regard, or at least\n\nsuperficial in his comparison.\n To be sure, everything that starts with \" post\" does not necessarily\n\ndwell under the same conceptual roof.\n However, Jameson 's actual reasoning in drawing this connection is\n\nsound, given Bell 's attempt to revive a belief in the existence of a\n\nnon-industrial capitalist society based on the production, ownership, and\n\nexchange of knowledge, which are well-known essentials of the postmodern\n\nsocial theory of Baudrillard and Lyotard.\n The End\n\nof Ideology  ( 1962) was associated with a much broader and somewhat\n\ndiffuse ideological movement in the 1950s and 1960s.\n The sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit, goals of this theoretical\n\ntendency were to replace the category of class as the operative unit of\n\nsocial analysis or to relegate it to historical utility only, as in the case\n\nof estate or caste, and/or to treat the contradictions of capitalism as\n\nmerely theoretical conjecture or no longer historically relevant.\n This position was associated with a largely technocratic stance on\n\nthe solution to existing social problems.\n The various elements of this theoretical development could be found\n\nin the works of a number of authors.\n The Affluent\n\nSociety  where he rejects the concept of structural contradiction and\n\ndenies the chronic depressionary tendencies of capitalist societies.\n Indeed, this position was elevated to the status of the self-evident\n\nuntil its validity was subsequently and summarily dashed on the shoals of the\n\n1957-58 recession in the U.S. \n\n  Classes in Modern\n\nSociety  also attempted a clever centrist slight of hand which is of\n\nconsiderable significance to understanding the postmodernist social and\n\ntheoretical project.\n Bottomore consigned \" Marxist\" class categories to the dustbin of\n\nhistorical, but not universal, validity.\n Their obsolescence ensued with the appearance of so-called \" status\n\ngroups\" in advanced capitalist societies, a concept of allegedly Weberian\n\nlineage.\n The theoretical justification was a highly skewed reading of Weber,\n\nwhich textual intervention heavily foregrounded \" consumption\" as the key\n\nsocial activity in such societies.\n This intervention was mostly derived from Parsons' ( 1946) reading of\n\nWeber in  The Structure of Social Action  ( see Wenger 1978, 1980a,\n\n1980b, 1987).\n Both of these positions- i.e., the posited historical limitations of\n\na class model derived from the \" productionist\" meta-narrative of Marx, as\n\nwell as the specific replacement of relations of production with relations of\n\nconsumption as the key dimension of social conflict and change-are at the\n\ncore of Baudrillard 's ( 1975, 1981) and Lyotard 's ( 1984, 1988) key writings.\n It should also be noted that Lyotard and Baudrillard pursue their\n\narguments using Marxist categories, with emendations, and denounce dogmatic\n\nMarxist political forms as mere extensions of the tyrannies of the past.\n In this last, they extend Foucault 's assault on the rule of the\n\nbourgeoisie in particular, and the Enlightenment in general, as nothing more\n\nthan the extension of historically previous modes of domination, but by\n\ndifferent methods. \n\n  The commonality between postmodernism and the earlier tendencies\n\npositing a post-industrial and, by extension, postmortem society was not\n\nconfined to one or two statements.\n ( 1966), published the same\n\nyear as Bottomore 's work, relegated the efficacy of class analysis to a \"\n\nmodernity\" ending before WWII, and replacing it with a post-\"WI condition\n\nthat, it was argued with vigor, demanded new forms of analysis of social\n\ninequality harmonious with the new realities.\n The further link that gives cohesiveness to an otherwise rather loose\n\ncollection of thinkers, appears in Dahrendorf 's  Class and Class Conflict\n\nin Industrial Society  ( 1959).\n This analysis claimed to provide both a new way of understanding\n\nsocial conflict and a new way of reconstructing hitherto existing models of\n\nsocial conflict.\n It raised more than the notion of an historical limit to Marxist\n\nmodels of social conflict based on the relations of production, as could be\n\nfound in Lenski or Bottomore.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "Guide to Massachusetts Tax and Employer Obligations Overview of\n\nFiling Requirements and Options\n\n  You will use different returns and follow different filing\n\nschedules depending on the amount of each trustee tax you expect to collect\n\nor excise tax you owe annually.\n To make filing and payment of taxes faster, more accurate, and more\n\nconvenient for taxpayers, Department of Revenue has several electronic filing\n\nand payment options which are discussed in this section.\n\n\n  After registering, you have the option of filing sales and\n\nwithholding tax returns from a personal computer using free \" PC File\"\n\nsoftware.\n Sales and withholding taxpayers participating in electronic funds\n\ntransfer ( see Payment Options), have the added option of using Business\n\nTelefile to file their sales and withholding tax returns using a touch-tone\n\ntelephone.\n\n  However, regardless of whether you use PC File software or\n\nBusiness Telefile, after you have registered, the Department of Revenue will\n\nmail you forms preprinted with your firm 's name, address, and identification\n\nnumber, for all of the trustee tax types for which you have registered.\n Most forms come in a booklet ( and resemble loan payment coupon\n\nbooklets).\n Note: If your business size makes you an annual filer, you will not\n\nreceive your form until December of the year for which you are filing.\n\n  If you do not plan to use PC File software or Business Telefile,\n\nor in the case of the tax types not covered by PC File software or Business\n\nTelefile, Department of Revenue urges you to use your preprinted forms, which\n\nwill facilitate accurate and timely processing of your returns.\n\n  All returns must be postmarked by the U.S.Postal Service at least\n\ntwo days prior to the due date of the return or be received by Department of\n\nRevenue on or before the due date to be considered on time.\n\n\n  Depending on which trustee taxes you collect and your annual\n\nliability for each tax type, you may be mandated to make certain trustee and\n\nother tax payments through electronic funds transfer ( EFT), or have the\n\noption of doing so.\n\n  EFT payments are mandatory for taxpayers who have over\n\n&dollar;250,000 in annual liabilities for withholding and sales and use ( including\n\nsales and use tax on telecommunication services).\n EFT is also mandatory for corporations, domestic and foreign, with\n\nannual liabilities over\n\n&dollar;250,000, and for taxpayers with annual gasoline, financial institution,\n\ninsurance, and utility excise tax liabilities over\n\n&dollar;100,000.\n\n  There are two methods available for making EFT payments: ACH (\n\nAutomated Clearing House) Credit-- The ACH Credit method is restricted to\n\ncertain tax types and filing frequencies ( refer to charts in More about\n\nSpecific Trustee and Excise Taxes Requiring Registration below).\n This method requires the taxpayer to instruct its financial\n\ninstitution to transfer money to Department of Revenue Application for\n\nparticipation is required.\n After applying you will receive a personal identification number (\n\nPIN) which can also be used for Business Telefile.\n Mass-Debit ( ACH Debit)--This method allows the taxpayer to make tax\n\npayments via touch-tone telephone.\n Any business taxpayer registered with Department of Revenue is\n\neligible to use this payment method.\n Application for participation is required.\n After applying you will receive a PIN which can also be used for\n\nBusiness Telefile.\n\n  For more information about Business Telefile, EFT, and how ACH\n\nCredit and Mass-Debit work, see Business Options: Electronic Filing and\n\nPayment Programs on Department of Revenue 's Web site or contact the\n\nDepartment of Revenue 's Automated Processing Bureau by phone at ( 617)\n\n887-5020 or by fax at ( 617) 887-5019.\n\n\n  Income tax withholding is the withholding of a portion of\n\nemployee wages for state and federal income tax purposes.\n As a general rule, the owner of a business that is incorporated is\n\nalso considered an employee for withholding tax purposes.\n If you were the sole proprietor of a business that has no other\n\nemployees, you would not be considered an employee and would not be required\n\nto register for withholding tax.\n ( However, as the owner you are required to make individual estimated\n\nincome tax payments if you expect to owe more than\n\n&dollar;200 in Massachusetts income tax on the income you receive from the business.\n\n\n  The amount you withhold from your employees for state income tax\n\npurposes should be based on Form M-4, Massachusetts Employee 's Withholding\n\nExemption Certificate ( submitted to you by each employee), and on Circular\n\nM, Massachusetts Income Tax Withholding Tables.\n A detailed explanation of how to use the tables or a percentage\n\nmethod for automated payroll systems is provided in Circular M.\n\n  The IRS and Social Security Administration ( SSA) also require\n\nemployers to withhold federal income tax and social security contributions\n\nfrom employee wages.\n Resources for obtaining additional information about your federal\n\nobligations are listed in the Help and Resources section at the end of this\n\nguide.\n\n  If you plan to selltangible personal property items, meals, or\n\ncertain telecommunications services you must register with Department of\n\nRevenue as a sales tax vendor and collect a 5 percent Massachusetts sales\n\ntax.\n\n  The Massachusetts sales and use tax applies to sales of tangible\n\npersonal property.\n Even if you are selling tangible personal property items at a\n\nwholesale level ( i.e., for eventual resale at the retail level), you still\n\nmust register as a sales tax vendor.\n All sales tax vendors must file the appropriate return ( Form ST-9\n\nseries); see overview of filing requirements above for electronic filing and\n\npayment options, and chart below for additional specifics).\n\n  Certain items are exempt from sales tax, such as items of\n\nclothing under\n\n&dollar;175 and food not purchased for immediate consumption.\n See A Guide to Sales and Use Tax for more information on the sales\n\ntax, including what is exempt.\n\n\n  The Massachusetts sales tax also applies to meals, which\n\nMassachusetts law defines as any food or beverage that has been prepared for\n\nimmediate consumption, including items sold on a take-out basis.\n Meals can be purchased from restaurants, any part of a store\n\nconsidered by Massachusetts law to be a restaurant, and other venues such as\n\nstreet carts and vending machines.\n The tax is 5 percent of the sales price of the meal.\n The Form ST-MAB-4, Sales Tax on Meals, Prepared Foods and All\n\nBeverages Return, is filed monthly and is due on or before the 20th day of\n\nthe following month.\n Payment is due with the return.\n See the chart below and A Guide to Sales Tax on Meals or the TA-1\n\ninstructions for additional details.\n\n\n  Telecommunications services include telephone and other\n\ntransmissions of information ( such as beeper services, cellular telephone\n\nservices, and telegram services).\n Cable television, Internet access and related online computer\n\nservices are exempt from the sales tax.\n Generally, the tax on the sale or use of telecommunications services\n\nis a tax on the transmission of messages or information by various electronic\n\nmeans, but not on the sale or use of information itself.\n All vendors must file the appropriate return ( Form STS-M or - Q);\n\nsee chart below.\n See A Guide to Sales and Use Tax or the TA-1 instructions for\n\nadditional details.\n\n\n  The use tax is 5 percent of the purchase price or rental charge\n\non tangible personal property ( including mail order items) on which no sales\n\ntax, or a sales tax less than 5 percent, was collected, and which are to be\n\nused, stored or consumed in the Commonwealth.\n Unlike the regular sales tax, the purchaser generally pays the use\n\ntax directly to the Commonwealth.\n For example, if you purchase furniture for your Massachusetts\n\nbusiness from an out-of-state firm and pay no sales tax, you are required to\n\npay the 5 percent use tax.\n If you are registered to collect sales taxes, you can report and pay\n\nuse taxes on your regular sales and use tax return.\n Otherwise, if you only make occasional purchases subject to use tax,\n\nyou can file and pay use taxes using the ST-10 Business Use Tax Return or the\n\nST-11 Individual Use Tax Return.\n See A Guide to Sales and Use Tax or the TA-1 instructions for\n\nadditional details.\n\n\n  In addition to exempting specific items, like articles of\n\nclothing under\n\n&dollar;175, from sales tax, the law exempts other types of purchases.\n For example: Sales where the purchaser intends to resell the item in\n\nthe regular course of business are exempt.\n In these cases, a Form ST-4, Resale Certificate, must be given to and\n\nretained by the seller as proof the sale was exempt for that reason.\n Purchasers must be registered sales/use tax vendors to obtain this\n\nexemption.\n They can obtain the Form ST-4 by calling the Department of Revenue 's\n\nCustomer Service Bureau at ( 617) 887-6367 or toll-free in Massachusetts at 1\n\n( 800) 392-6089.\n Sales of materials, tools, fuel, machinery and replacement parts,\n\nwhich will be used directly and exclusively in the manufacture, processing or\n\nconversion of tangible personal property to be sold, are exempt in many\n\ncases.\n The vendor must receive from the purchaser a Form ST-12 , Exempt Use\n\nCertificate, and maintain proper records on such sales.\n Sales to organizations that have tax-exempt status are generally\n\nexempt from sales tax.\n The purchaser must present the seller with the appropriate exempt\n\npurchaser certificate to obtain the exemption.\n The two basic categories of tax-exempt purchasers are governmental\n\norganizations and charitable and nonprofit organizations.\n To obtain an exempt purchaser certificate, purchasers must register\n\nwith the Department of Revenue ( by completing the TA-1 registration).\n Please note: Tax-exempt organizations that sell tangible personal\n\nproperty or telecommunications services on a regular basis are considered\n\nvendors and are required to collect sales/use tax.\n\n  Because of the complexity of the law, some guidelines listed here\n\nmay not apply to every transaction.\n Be sure to consult A Guide to Sales and Use Tax or the TA-1\n\ninstructions for additional information on other types of exempt sales and\n\ndetails on the examples above.\n See also Massachusetts Regulation 830 CMR 64H.8.1, which discusses\n\nresale and exempt use certificates.\n To avoid any interest or penalty charges on sales tax that was not\n\ncollected properly, taxpayers with questions about the taxability of any sale\n\nshould contact the Department of Revenue.\n <p\n\n<Massachusetts imposes a room occupancy e xcise tax of 5.7 percent on rooms\n\nrented for\n\n&dollar;15 or more per day.\n And each Massachusetts city and town has the option of levying up to\n\nan additional 4 percent.\n In addition, Massachusetts imposes a convention center financing fee\n\nof 2.75 percent on room occupancy in hotels, motels, or other lodging\n\nestablishments in Boston, Cambridge, Springfield, and Worcester.\n\n  The total tax rate is applied only to the rent received from an\n\nindividual who occupies the lodgings for 90 consecutive days or less.\n Generally, you are responsible for collecting and remitting this tax\n\nif you are an individual or business operating a hotel, motel, lodging house,\n\nor a private club offering sleeping accommodations, and, the relationship\n\nbetween you and the occupant is not that of landlord and tenant.\n Establishments must file the appropriate return: Form RO-2CF for\n\nBoston, Cambridge, Springfield and Worcester establishments, and Form RO-2\n\nfor all others.\n Returns are due monthly, 20 days after the end of the following\n\nmonth, i.e., February 20, for the January filing period, and so on.\n Payment is due with return.\n For additional information, see the Convention Center Financing\n\nSurcharges section below and the TA-1 instructions .\n Excise on Alcoholic Beverages Sold by Chapter 180\n\nOrganizations\n\n  Generally, any corporation, association, or organization that is\n\nlicensed by any city or town in Massachusetts to sell alcoholic beverages and\n\nwhich was organized under Chapter 180 of Massachusetts General Laws,\n\nincluding fraternal organizations, must pay a yearly excise of .57 percent on\n\nthe gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages.\n Any corporation, association, or organization that is subject to the\n\nbusiness corporation excise, or that is a chartered veterans' organization\n\nthat maintains quarters for the exclusive use of its members, is not liable\n\nfor this excise.\n\n  Gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages are the total\n\nproceeds from the sales of all drinks with an alcoholic nature or content.\n Any cost or expense relating to the purchase, storage or sale of\n\nalcoholic beverages may not be deducted from gross receipts.\n Chapter 180 Organizations Selling Alcoholic Beverages must file\n\nMassachusetts Form 180 annually, by April 15 of the following year, to report\n\ngross receipts for the previous calendar year.\n Payment is due with return.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6634cf96-a63d-430e-8f41-d1924f59ab3e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.710729+00:00"}
{"text": "As we pass beneath the Golden Gate Bridge on our way out to sea, I\n\nlook up and see the gold hammer and sickle on red emblazoned on the immense\n\nstack of this 300-plus foot ship.\n It is October 1990.\nAkademik\n\nMstislav Keldysh, is the flagship of the P.P. Shirshov Institute of\n\nOceanology and one of the prides of the Soviet Oceanographic Fleet, and\n\nrightly so.\n Hailing from Kaliningrad, she is well fit for oceanographic duty, with\n\nenough winches, davits, and A-frames to accommodate any requirement.\n She can support 130 people in 18 laboratories, and she carries two\n\nspecial pearls: the pair of small, three-person submersibles,Mir\n\n1andMir 2(Mirmeans \" peace\"), tucked protectively\n\nbeneath her hydraulically activated awnings on the starboard aft deck.\nwere built for the Soviets by the\n\nFinnish company Rauma-Repola in 1987 and 1988.\n Blimplike in shape, they sport a top deck painted international orange\n\nfor increased visibility on the water surface. \n\n\n  On this sunny morning in Monterey Bay, I watch the preparations\n\nfor the day 's dives.\n The routine is familiar to me: wrench- bearing technicians top off\n\nhydraulic lines with fluid and adjust ballast; a pilot peers through the\n\nforward viewport ofMir 1as he runs through predive checks of\n\nmanipulator functions; and replenishing supplies are passed into the crew\n\nsphere.\n With the submersible ready to go, the diving team, outfitted in\n\nsky-blue jumpsuits, pauses ritually at a threshold.\n The three then emerge in order--copilot, scientist, pilot--and climb\n\nup to the hatch and into the sphere.\n A complement of ship 's crew and scientists man the railings to watch\n\nthe launch progress.\nis hoisted off the deck with a crane and lowered over\n\nthe side into the water.\n A swimmer from an inflatable life-boat leaps onto the sub and deftly\n\nreleases the lift line.\naway from the ship and stands by\n\nwhile the pilot completes the predive checks.\nbegins her\n\n60th descent.\n\n\n boats are only babies compared\n\nto the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution 's submersibleAlvin,\n\nwhich I recently piloted on her 2,400th dive.\nare first-class submersibles, destined for a\n\nfuture of technically and scientifically successful dives.\n Already, the Soviets have used them to explore seafloor sites\n\nthroughout the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\nwork,\n\nthen moved outward to virgin seafloor where they continually find new\n\nfeatures of interest.\nwill likely be the first\n\ndeep-diving boats to work the unexplored seafloor of the Indian Ocean, where\n\nimportant scientific observations await.\ncan\n\nexplore vast areas of the ocean 's bed that are inaccessible toAlvin.\n\n\n\n\n  We anchor off Monterey.\n Ship 's crew and scientists are given unrestricted leave to go ashore,\n\nand the ship 's cutter is pressed into service as a ferry.\n For many of the scientists, and for myself, too, the visit to Ed\n\nRicketts 'sCannery Rowlaboratory is something of a pilgrimage.\n One Soviet biologist, Lev Moskalev, shows me his well-thumbed copy of\n\nJohn Steinbeck 's Cannery Row, wherein Ed Ricketts, a classic marine\n\nbiologist, is so colorfully portrayed.\n Lev Moskalev is himself a great naturalist; his laboratory notebooks\n\nare filled with careful observations, detailed sketches, queries, and\n\ntheories.\n Some of his queries are directed at my own research, and these\n\nstimulate a congenial debate over our diverse interpretations of the natural\n\nhistory of an animal we have both studied. \n\n  As the Soviets invade the small town of Monterey, they invite\n\neveryone they meet to an impromptu open house aboardKeldysh.\n The cutter runs continuously, carrying visitors to the ship.\n The guests are given tours, invited to meals, and asked to join crew\n\nmembers in their staterooms for tea, wine, or vodka.\n Laughter and singing resonate in the passageways as the Russians\n\nentertain their guests with unbounded graciousness and hospitality.\n At midnight, under moonlight, the last guests hug their new friends\n\ngoodbye.\n With tears in their eyes, they reluctantly board the cutter to leave\n\nthe ship.\n\n A Record Dive to 4,065 Meters and an Abyssal\n\nPlain\n\n  Another day, in deep water off Ensenada, Mexico, it is my turn to\n\ndive.\n I pause at the threshold wearing my borrowed jumpsuit and sporting\n\nthe gold dolphins that mark me as a US Navy- qualified, deep-submersible\n\npilot.\n As copilot on this dive, I am first to step out and climb into the\n\nsubmarine.\n I am followed by Julia Tchindonova and Dima Vasilyev.\n Our dive plan is straightforward.\n As the scientist on board, Julia will study the distribution of large\n\nzooplankton in the water column.\n We descend slowly, 10 meters per minute, with the floodlights on.\n Julia peers intently out the forward viewport, identifying and\n\ncounting the organisms that pass through a 1-cubic-meter frame held by one of\n\nthe manipulators.\n Between 500 meters and 1,000 meters, we pass through a layer that is\n\nthe daytime home of giant squid.\n Attracted to our lights, they approach the submarine and keep us\n\nglued to the viewports.\n These animals ascend to the surface at night to feed, where they are\n\neagerly hooked beneath deck lights by the ship 's sailors.\n Squid flesh supplements the galley 's stores; squid beaks are\n\ndissected out and kept as trophies. \n\n  It is a long, six-hour descent that ultimately takes us to 4,065\n\nmeters and an abyssal plain of soft brown sediment.\n For me, it is a personal depth record I won't be able to exceed\n\ninAlvin.\n On the bottom, the pilot, Dima, passes control of the submersible to\n\nme.\n I find the sub agile, skimming over the soft sediment surface with\n\nease as I operate the joystick.\n Dima takes over and shows his skill and dexterity with the\n\nmanipulators.\n In every respect, he demonstrates the professionalism of an\n\nexperienced deep-submersible pilot. \n\n\n  On days that the submersibles do not dive, the ship is occupied\n\nwith other scientific activities.\n For example, a large ( 150- liter) water-sampling bottle is\n\nrepeatedly serviced, hoisted off the stern, and lowered to different levels\n\nin the water column where the bottle is tripped closed and the sample is\n\nreturned to the surface.\n Once on deck, water is siphoned from the bottle and distributed to a\n\nmyriad of laboratories for a carefully orchestrated suite of productivity.\n This research program is being undertaken on a global scale; on this\n\nvoyage ofKeldyshalone, hundreds of samples along a transect that\n\nstretches from one shore of the Pacific 0cean to the other have been\n\ncollected and analyzed. \n\n  Two men stand as silhouettes against the sun that sets over the\n\nrugged desert mountains of the Baja Peninsula.\n With intense concentration, they parry and thrust their fist-sized\n\nchessman across a checkered field.\n As I quietly enjoy this decidedly Russian vignette, Anatoly\n\nSagalevitch approaches.\n Sagalevitch-- his name gave me a pause at first, but now the\n\nsyllables tumble out in a satisfying rhythm: Sa-ga-le'-vitch.\n He is an admirable man: scientist, engineer, skilled pilot, and\n\noutstanding leader.\noperate successfully because of his talents.\n As we look out over the surface of the becalmed sea, we speak in\n\nsimplest Russian of the mysteries that lie beneath us, and we speak of our\n\nsubmersibles.\n Though our sentences are short and the conversation brief, we reach\n\nbeyond politics and pretenses to establish a professional bond that will last\n\nthroughout our careers as scientists and pilots. \n\n\n  We sail up the Gulf of California--the Sea of Cortez--and\n\ntheMirsare again readied for dives.\nsails smoothly over the water, strong winds\n\nhave pushed up sizable waves that threaten to cancel our dive plans.\n Word is finally passed to carry on with the dives, and I climb\n\nintoMir 2with two other pilots, Dima and Sagalevitch.\n On this dive, Sagalevitch and I share the science program.\n We will dive on hydrothermal vent sites and use a slurp gun to sample\n\nzooplankton in the water column around the vents.\n Despite the rough seas our launch is flawless and we descend 25\n\nmeters per minute to the seafloor.\n Once on the bottom, the submersible 's sonar picks up return signals\n\nfrom mounds of sediment.\n We drive toward one and find a vast colony of tube worms, bacterial\n\nmats, and warm shimmering water at the top.\n Sagalevitch goes to work, positioning the submersible without\n\nstirring up the sediment, setting up the pump, and sampling the water.\n With one sample collected, we move off to additional stations along a\n\ntransect away from the vent site.\n When the samples are processed back in the ship 's laboratory, we will\n\nfind out if bacterial production at the vent supports an enriched zooplankton\n\ncommunity in the overlying water column. \n\n  As we sample, I peer out the viewport and see the eerie lights\n\nofMir 1working nearby.\n The two submersibles often dive together, each serving as a rescue\n\nvehicle for the other.\n Eight hours into the dive, we finish sampling and confer with the\n\nmother ship about weather conditions.\n The sea state has worsened, we are told, and the decision is made to\n\nstay submerged for another eight hours.\ncannot afford.\npower capacity limits its workday to 8 or 9 hours,\n\nalthough in an emergency she can stay submerged up to 72 hours.\nroutinely submerge for 16 hours with full power (\n\nalthough shorter dives are planned whenever a woman is scheduled to dive);\n\nfor emergencies, theMirsalso have extended submergence capabilities.\n\n\n\n  With our extra bottom time, we decide to tour the hydrothermal\n\nmounds in the area, traversing from one site to another using the sonar to\n\nlocate targets.\n Each mound is different.\n Some have profuse animal communities with diffuse venting of\n\nlow-temperature water;

{"text": "Educational efforts and innovative policies have reduced the\n\nprevalence of cigarette smoking among US adults from 41.7% in 1965' to 28.8%\n\nin 1987.2\n Despite this progress, 15.7% of deaths in 1984 could still be\n\nattributed to smoking.3\n African Americans suffer from a particularly severe burden of\n\nsmoking-related disease.\n The age-adjusted smoking-attributable mortality rate among African\n\nAmericans in 1984 was 143.2 per 100 000 persons compared with 119.0 among\n\nWhites.3\n The 1987 National Health Interview Survey found that 32.9% of\n\nAfrican-American adults smoked compared with 28.5% of White adults; the\n\nproportion of ever smokers who had quit was far lower among African Americans\n\n( 31.0% vs 45.8%).2 \n\n  Much attention has therefore been directed to reducing the\n\nprevalence of smoking among African Americans.4,5\n Identification of factors that promote smoking in the African-American\n\ncommunity is a prerequisite to developing effective interventions.\n Evidence from the 1987 General Social Survey suggests that stress may\n\nbe such a factor.6 \n\n\n  Psychological stress can be defined as an \" internal subjective\n\nstate involving the perception of threat to one 's well-being,\" while\n\nstressors are stimuli that provoke psychological stress in susceptible\n\nindividuals.7\n Stressors have been shown to increase tobacco consumption among\n\nestablished smokers,8 promote adolescent cigarette use,9 predispose to\n\nsmoking clinic failure,10 and precipitate relapses among successful\n\nquitters.\",11,12\n Investigators have evaluated a variety of potential stressors,\n\nincluding anxiety-inducing tasks,8 family turmoil,9 job factors,13 and major\n\nlife events ( e.g., unemployment, divorce).6,10 \n\n  Lazarus and colleagues have recently argued that daily hassles\n\nmay represent a better conceptualization of stress than traditional measures\n\nof major life events.14\n They define hassles as \" the initiating, frustrating, distressing\n\ndemands that to some degree characterize everyday transactions with the\n\nenvironment.\"15\n Hassles appear to predict many health outcomes, including\n\npsychological distress,15 somatic symptoms,16 respiratory illness episodes,17\n\nand arthritis-related disability.18 \n\n  In a 12-month follow-up study of ex-smokers who had participated\n\nin a smoking cessation program, the frequency and severity of hassles were\n\nsignificant predictors of late relapse in men, but not in women.19\n A similar evaluation of a work-site smoking cessation program found\n\nthat the mean severity of hassles, but not the count, predicted relapse by 12\n\nmonths.20\n Previous studies have not addressed the relationship between hassles\n\nand the prevalence of smoking in a community sample.\n Given the role of smoking as a psychological coping behavior,7 we\n\nhypothesized that persons reporting numerous hassles would be more likely to\n\nsmoke than those experiencing fewer stressors.  \n\n\n  There is extensive epidemiologic evidence of a relationship\n\nbetween social support and diverse health outcomes.21\n Persons with high levels of social support have lower mortality\n\nrates,22 have less coronary atherosclerosis, and use less health care24 than\n\nthose with lower levels of support.\n Social support may exert these salutary effects partially by\n\nfostering changes in health-related behaviors, such as smoking.\n Indeed, successful quitters have higher levels of perceived support\n\nfrom their partners than smokers who never quit or relapse.25\n Having someone to talk to about one 's problems predicted cessation in\n\nanother recent study.26\n The prevalence of smoking is higher among separated or divorced\n\npersons than among those currently married or widowed,2 even after\n\ncontrolling for other demographic characteristics.27\n We therefore hypothesized that persons with poor social support would\n\nbe more likely to smoke than those with good support. \n\n\n  The mechanism by which social support improves health outcomes\n\nhas been a subject of intense debate.28\n Advocates of the buffering hypothesis argue that social support works\n\nby moderating the deleterious effect of stressful events and serving as \"\n\ncoping assistance.\"29\n Therefore, our final hypothesis was that any association between\n\nsocial support and smoking would be stronger among persons experiencing\n\nstressors than among those in low-stressor environments. \n\n  The present study was undertaken to assess the cross-sectional\n\nrelationship between these social factors and smoking behavior in a large\n\npopulation-based sample of African-American adults in the San Francisco Bay\n\narea. \n\n\n  As part of a prospective controlled community intervention trial\n\nto reduce cancer mortality, a survey of African-American households in San\n\nFrancisco and Oakland, Calif., was conducted between November 1985 and July\n\n1986.\n Potential respondents were identified through two-stage probability\n\nsampling.\n In the first stage, 100 census blocks with at least 25% African-\n\nAmerican population according to the 1980 census) were randomly selected from\n\neach city.\n Specific households were then randomly selected from each block.\n Using the Kish procedure, interviewers randomly identified one\n\nrespondent from each household with an African-American member aged 20 years\n\nor over.30\n A non-profit survey research organization hired, trained, and\n\nsupervised field workers.\n Intensive efforts were made to interview persons who were not\n\navailable during the initial visit.\n Follow-up telephone contacts with at least 10% of all respondents\n\nconfirmed that the interviews took place and that the information obtained\n\nwas accurate. \n\n  The survey instrument included questions about current health\n\nstatus, health behaviors, use of preventive services, sources of health\n\ninformation, knowledge and attitudes regarding cancer, social networks and\n\nstressors, and demographic characteristics.\n Smokers were defined in the usual manner2 as individuals who\n\ncurrently smoked and had smoked at least 100 cigarettes since birth.\n Average daily consumption of 20 or more cigarettes was used as the\n\ncutoff to separate heavy smokers from light smokers.\n Demographic variables included age, gender, years of formal\n\neducation, household income ( recoded from an ordinal into a continuous\n\nvariable), marital status, and employment.\n Respondents were asked to describe the impact of smoking on cancer\n\nrisk ( 1 through 7 scale); those who indicated that it had no effect, a\n\nfavorable effect, or an unknown effect were categorized as \" unaware.\" \n\n  A four-item, health-specific locus of control scale was adapted\n\nfrom the work of Wallston et al.31\n This scale represents the mean of standardized Likert-type responses\n\n( coded 1 through 6) to four statements concerning self- control over health.\n A high score represents a strong belief in one 's ability to avoid\n\ngetting sick by taking care of oneself, to stay healthy by following \" the\n\nadvice of experts,\" and to control \" the most important things that affect\n\nhealth.\" \n\n  A 10-item hassles index was created by abbreviating the original\n\nKanner et al. list of 117 hassles.l5\n Each item was chosen to represent a dimension that community\n\nresidents involved in the project perceived to be especially relevant ( Table\n\n1).\n The second item ( \" having a serious illness or accident\")was deleted\n\nfrom the scale because of concern that such events might be consequences\n\nrather than causes of smoking.32\n Scoring from zero to nine was based upon how many of the remaining\n\nhassles happened to the respondent or a person \" most important\" to him or\n\nher during the preceding three months.\n We did not employ an intensity scale because the frequency of hassles\n\nhas superior predictive power.l5-l7\n In accord with Dohrenwend 's recommendations,32 we inquired whether\n\nthese events occurred but did not ask for any judgment as to their\n\nsignificance. \n\n  The original Kanner et al. Instrument was reportedl7 to have a\n\ntest- retest reliability of r = 0.79 with nine consecutive monthly\n\nadministrations.\n Similar instruments developed by Weinberger et al.,18 Wolf et al.,33\n\nand DeLongis et al.34 have demonstrated 5- through 9-month median test-retest\n\nreliabilities of .72 to .77.\n Our abbreviated instrument had good internal consistency ( Cronbach 's\n\n( = .74) We validated the scale against demographic variables; the mean score\n\nwas 2.S for employed and 4.1 for unemployed respondents.\n Hassle scores were inversely related to family income ( r = - .19, P\n\n= .0001). \n\n  Measures of social network characteristics can be categorized as\n\neither structural or functional.\n Structural features were assessed using Berkman and Syme 's Social\n\nNetwork Index ( SNI),22 which measures four types of social ties: marital\n\nstatus, number of close friends, number of close relatives, and membership in\n\nformal groups.\n This index was modified slightly by adding two types of specified\n\norganizations ( neighborhood and senior groups) and dropping a question on\n\nthe frequency of contact with close friends or relatives.\n Scores range from one to four, where one represents those with the\n\nfewest relatives or friends and no history of church or group involvement.\n Functional features were assessed using Seeman and Syme 's three-item\n\nNetwork Instrumental Support scale,23 which measures whether respondents\n\nwould \" most likely\" turn to friends or family for assistance with rides,\n\nborrowing \" a small sum of money,\" or household repairs.\n Their four-item Network Emotional Support scale23 was abbreviated to\n\ntwo items, only one of which had construct validity ( \" Who would you turn to\n\nfor information or advice about a personal problem?\").\n This question, scored one for those who cited friends or family and\n\nzero for others, resembles the emotional support item used by Strogatz and\n\nJames.35 \n\n  The distribution of demographic characteristics was examined\n\namong smoking status categories: never smokers, ex-smokers, current light\n\nsmokers, and current heavy smokers.\n Analysis of variance with two-tailed pairwise t tests and\n\nBonferroni 's correction for multiple comparisons was used to contrast the\n\nmeans of continuous variables.\n Chi-square analysis, with Yates'continuity correction for 2 x 2\n\ntables, was performed on categorical variables.\n The Kruskal-Wallis procedure with two-tailed pairwise mean rank\n\ncomparisons and Bonferroni 's correction was applied to ordinal variables.\n\n\n\n  Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to\n\ndetermine whether social support and hassles contributed to explaining\n\nsmoking status after controlling for potential confounders.\n Heavy smokers and light smokers were aggregated because of their\n\nsimilar characteristics.\n In the absence of data about when or why respondents quit, both never\n\nsmokers and ex-smokers were categorized as non-smokers in our primary\n\nanalyses.\n Independent variables included age ( with a quadratic term),gender,\n\neducational status ( <12 years, 12 years, 13 through 15 years , and 216\n\nyears), household income ( transformed to optimize fit), health-specific\n\nlocus of control, and lack of awareness about the risk of smoking.\n These variables were selected on the basis of previous studies of\n\nsmoking correlates.2~36 \n\n  The abbreviated hassles index was then added to the basic model\n\nto determine the role of psychosocial stress, controlling for demographic and\n\nattitudinal characteristics.\n Social support variables were added next, with the reference group\n\nconsisting of individuals with SNI = 4 ( optimal) and Network Instrumental\n\nSupport and emotional support scales greater than zero.\n To test the hypothesis that social support buffers the deleterious\n\neffects of stress, interaction terms between the hassles index and the three\n\nsupport measures were tested.\n All two-factor interactions involving demographics and social support\n\nwere evaluated by forward selection and backward elimination procedures.37\n\nThe significance level for entry and exit was ( = .10, with adjustment to\n\nensure that terms derived from a single variable entered together.\n Hierarchical models were compared with the likelihood ratio test.\n\n\n\n  Finally, multivariate linear regression was used to determine\n\nfactors associated with self-reported daily cigarette consumption among\n\ncurrent smokers.\n Multicollinearities prohibited inclusion of interaction terms in this\n\nmodel.\n The PROC LOGIST and PROC REG programs in SAS were used for most\n\nanalyses.38 Odds ratios ( ORB) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs) were\n\ncalculated by exponentiating the logistic coefficient estimates.\n These Ors modestly overestimate the true risk ratios because the \"\n\nrare disease\" assumption underlying the OR is not satisfied. \n\n\n  The total sample size was 1137, representing a response rate of\n\n67.6% in Oakland and 69.1% in San Francisco.\n The age, gender, and income distributions of our sample closely\n\nresembled 1980 census data from the same neighborhoods.\n The San Francisco and Oakland samples were almost equal in size ( 569\n\nand 568, respectively) and showed similar demographic characteristics.\n\n\n  Of the 1134 respondents who described their smoking habits, 36.0%\n\nnever smoked, 22.1% had quit smoking, 26.8% were light smokers, and 15.1%\n\nwere heavy smokers.\n Current smoking was more prevalent among women than among men ( 43.1%\n\nvs 40.1%), but female smokers were less likely than male smokers to consume\n\n20 or more cigarettes daily. \n\n\n\n\n  Table 2 illustrates how the sociodemographic characteristics of\n\ncurrent smokers differed from those of ex-smokers and never smokers.\n Ex- smokers were significantly older than current or never smokers.\n Ex-smokers were more than twice as likely to have graduated from\n\ncollege as heavy smokers ( 15.6% vs 7.1%).\n About 41% of heavy smokers and 36% of light smokers were separated or\n\ndivorced, compared with only 20% of never smokers and 24% of ex- smokers.\n Current smokers reported lower household incomes than ex-smokers.\n Heavy smokers had a particularly high frequency of disability (\n\n15.4%); both light and heavy smokers were more likely to be unemployed than\n\nex-smokers or never smokers.\n Current smokers had higher hassle scores than either ex- smokers or\n\nnever smokers, whereas the latter two groups had higher SNI scores.\n More than 15% of heavy smokers denied a link between smoking and\n\ncancer, as compared with 4% of nonsmokers.",

{"text": "I began asking by myself the question: \" What is the best group\n\nintervention to treat test anxiety in graduate students?\"\n I began my search by accessing the Social Work Library website.\n I conducted searches on a couple of different databases.\n The first database I searched on was ProQuest.\n I searched \" test taking anxiety\" and \" graduate students\" and \" group\n\ninterventions\" and received no results.\n I then simplified my search to just \" test anxiety\" and \" graduate\n\nstudents\" and found some results; however, most of them were studies on test\n\nanxiety and not on treatment.\n I then added \" treatment\" to my previous search and found two studies\n\non test anxiety and treatment.\n I decided to try and search ERIC.\n I entered \" test anxiety\" and \" graduate students\" and \" treatment\"\n\nin the search categories and found two articles that included that criterion.\n I then searched the PsychInfo database using the terms \" graduate\n\nstudents\", \" test anxiety\", and \" treatment\".\n I found many articles about the treatment of test anxiety.\n I then tried to scale down my results by adding \" group treatment\"\n\nand found studies that specifically had tested a group treatment approach.\n I attempted to add \" evidence based practice\" to this search but\n\nfound no results.\n I only included articles from scholarly journals and attempted to\n\nlook for more recent studies.\n When I could not access a journal article through the Columbia\n\nUniversity Library I entered the title into Google Scholar to see if the text\n\nwas available on the internet.\n After conducting my literature search I came up with my COPES\n\nquestion which asks \" If second year social work graduate students who are\n\nexperiencing test anxiety about the LMSW licensing exam receive cognitive\n\nrestructuring or relaxation therapy or skills training in a group setting\n\nwill they show reduced levels of anxiety after intervention?\" I used this\n\nquestion to guide my reading of the studies found. \n\n This study synthesized the results of 56 studies on text anxiety\n\ntreatments.\n The analysis looked at studies that used cognitive-behavioral, skill\n\nfocused, cognitive, meditation, and physical exercise based interventions.\n The most effective interventions were those that combined cognitive\n\nand skills training ( E=1.22).\n The next most effective treatment was found to be behavioral and\n\nskills training ( E=1.10).\n Behavioral interventions only were also found to be effective (\n\nE=.80).\n Other techniques like meditation and physical exercise produced a\n\nsmall effect size so were deemed less effective in reducing anxiety symptoms\n\n( E=0.15). \n\n  In terms of intervention techniques the analysis showed that\n\ncognitive restructuring has the largest effect size ( E=1.10).\n Other techniques that also produced large effect sizes were combined\n\nbehavioral and skills focused training, cognitive and skills focused\n\ntraining, other behavioral techniques, anxiety management training, CBT and\n\nskills focused training, and systematic desensitization.\n Behavior modification, study skills training, meditation, and\n\nphysical exercise techniques were all shown to have small effect sizes. \n\n  This study reports the efficacy of cognitive restructuring on\n\nreducing test anxiety symptoms.\n The study consisted of three groups with a total of thirty-six\n\nparticipants who are college or graduate schools.\n One group received a cognitive restructuring treatment, one group\n\nreceived an exposure treatment, and the last group received no treatment.\n Based comparing the scores of questionnaires given to the group in\n\nthe first and last session, the authors found that participants in the\n\ncognitive restructuring group experienced a greater reduction in anxiety\n\nsymptoms. \n\n  This study looks at the effectiveness of the combination of\n\ncognitive and relaxation therapy and study-skills training in reducing\n\nanxiety symptoms and improving test scores.\n Forty-five undergraduate test-anxious students participated in the\n\nstudy.\n The study consisted of four different groups.\n One group received relaxation and cognitive therapy, one group was\n\nreceived study-skills training, one group received a combination of cognitive\n\nand relaxation therapy and study-skills training and the last group received\n\nno treatment.\n The authors found that the combined therapy of cognitive/relaxation\n\ntherapy and study-skills training were significantly more effective than\n\neither treatment alone in reducing anxiety symptoms. \n\n  Many studies have found that a multimodal approach is more\n\neffective in reducing test taking anxiety.\n In Ergene ( 2003) results show that a combination of cognitive\n\ntherapy and skills training is most effective in reducing test taking\n\nanxiety.\n Goldfried et al. ( 1978) and Denado and Diener ( 1986) supported the\n\nfinding of the meta-analysis.\n The Ergene ( 2003) study has the highest level of scientific support\n\nfor effectiveness because it is a meta-analysis of 56 other studies.\n Bloom, Fischer, and Orme ( 2009) state that in order to provide our\n\nclients with evidence based practices it is important to focus on studies\n\nthat are able to synthesize many different studies to find the practices with\n\nthe largest effect size.\n The quasi-experimental studies I found on test taking anxiety have\n\nsmall sample sizes, varying research settings, and conflicting results.\n Ergene ( 2003) was able to test the results from these different\n\nstudies to answer the broad question of which interventions are most helpful\n\nin reducing anxiety symptoms in test anxious participants. \n\n  Based on research on test anxiety treatments I have decided to\n\ncreate a group that combines cognitive restructuring and skills-focused\n\ntraining.\n This group will address the psychological reactions that the students\n\nhave around taking the licensing test as well as teach them skills to help\n\nwith recall, organized thinking, and time management. \n\n  For students who are interested in joining the group the\n\nintervention will be a combination of cognitive therapy and skills-focused\n\ntraining.\n These treatments are based on the theories that negative cognitions\n\nand learning deficits cause test taking anxiety ( Jones and Petruzzi, 1995).\n The cognitive therapy technique that will be used is cognitive\n\nrestructuring.\n In the first thirty minutes of each session the main facilitator will\n\nask for examples from the group of negative cognitions they have had about\n\ntaking the LMSW exam.\n Examples of these cognitions include statements like \" I am so stupid\n\nI don't even know where to begin studying\" and \" People like me never pass\n\ntests.\"\n The group will work together to challenge any negative cognitions and\n\nrestructure them so that they are neutral or positive. \n\n  The skills training component will compliment cognitive\n\nrestructuring because often students with test anxiety feel that they need\n\nbetter skills to do well on an exam ( Poorman et al., 2009).\n The skills training component of the group will take place during the\n\nlast half an hour of each session.\n The skills training will include these topics: goal setting, time\n\nmanagement, improving study skills, and test-taking strategies. \n\n  At the beginning of each session, students will be asked to\n\ncomplete the Test Anxiety Inventory ( Spielberger, 1980) and take a 5\n\nquestion test based on material covered on the LMSW exam.\n Homework will be assigned to practice both techniques.\n Students will be asked to keep a weekly diary card where they will\n\nrecord negative thoughts they have about taking a test while outside the\n\ngroup.\n Student will be asked to do a variety of different assignments in\n\norder to practice the skills-focused training techniques they learn in group.\n These will include creating a study schedule and time management\n\nchart. \n\n  The first strength of these operationalized versions of the\n\noutcomes are that the main outcome, a decreased level of anxiety, will be\n\nmeasured using a standardized measure that has been proved valid and has a\n\nset of norms for different populations. \n\n  The second strength of these measures is that they can easily be\n\nanalyzed.\n\n\n  The greatest weakness of these operationalized outcome measures\n\nis that they require a lot of work from the participants.\n This is especially difficult when the problem the group is addressing\n\nis related to performance anxiety.\n The amount of work needed for each measurement might trigger greater\n\nanxiety in some participants. \n\n  The target of the group intervention is anxious feelings around\n\ntest taking.\n Jones and Petruzzi ( 1995) state that negative cognitions present in\n\ntest taking anxious individual impair good performance.\n Poorman et al. ( 2009) adds that individuals often experience\n\nbehaviors like difficulty paying attention, frequently getting off task, and\n\nincreased distractibility.\n The intervention will address the different facets of test anxiety.\n The cognitive restructuring component of the intervention will seek\n\nto reduce negative cognitions by examining the students' cognitions and\n\nsystematically altering these thoughts to promote positive thoughts around\n\ntest taking abilities.\n The skills-focused training component will focus on the behaviors\n\nassociated with test taking anxiety.\n Skills like time management, creating a study log, and various\n\nstrategies for test taking will address learning deficits and negative\n\nbehaviors.\n After the intervention students in the group will be able to alter\n\ntheir own negative cognitions and use the skills learned to prepare for the\n\nLMSW test, which will lead to lower anxiety. \n\n  Group participation will be measured by the verbal participation\n\nof the group participants.\n The co-facilitator will record the frequency of each persons' verbal\n\nparticipation during the group session.\n Verbal participation is defined in a broad way as meaning any time a\n\nparticipants speaks in the group.\n Participants will be expected to participate at least once a session.\n Without verbal participation one can assume that members are not\n\nreceiving the full benefits of being in the group. \n\n  The strength of this kind of measure is its ease of use.\n No special equipment is needed and it is easy to chart change in\n\nbehavior over time ( Bloom, Fischer, and Orme, 2009).\n The weakness of this type of measure is that some participants might\n\nbe uncomfortable speaking in front of the group.\n This is especially true since the participants are experiencing\n\nsymptoms of anxiety that might make them feel too vulnerable to share their\n\nfeelings. \n\n  Trends in the data will be examined in order to assess the\n\nsuccess of the intervention.\n Each outcome measure will be graphed for a visual analysis of the\n\ntrend.\n Since groups are made up of individuals whose scores vary there can\n\noften be outliers that might skew a mean or standard deviation of the data (\n\nBloom, Fischer, and Orme, 2009).\n To avoid this all data will be plotted using a box plot that takes\n\ninto account the median score of each outcome and range of the scores.\n The baseline will be collected from the measurements administered\n\nduring the first session before the intervention. \n\n  Research has shown that there are gender and cross-cultural\n\ndifferences in the rate of test taking anxiety.\n Everson et al. ( 1991) found that women experience more anxiety\n\naround test taking and academic achievement than men.\n Some researchers hypothesize that this is because woman are\n\nsocialized to express their emotions, while men are taught to suppress their\n\nfeelings ( Boda and Ollendick, 2005).\n Bodas and Ollendick ( 2005) also found that test anxiety differs\n\ncross-culturally.\n The authors feel that the variation in parenting styles accounts for\n\nmuch of this difference.\n In many non-Western cultures parents put excessive pressure on their\n\nchildren to do well academically.\n This pressure causes non-Western children to have more test anxiety\n\nbut also more shame about that anxiety.\n Overall, Bodas and Ollenick ( 2005) suggest that there is a lack of\n\ntheoretical background in test taking anxiety that is based on the\n\nunderstanding of the norms and beliefs of different cultures. \n\n  Research around test anxiety has also been done across different\n\nraces.\n This research focuses on the achievement gap between white and Asian\n\nstudents and African American, Latino, and other students of color.\n Osburne ( 2001) cites theories that reveal that non-white students\n\noften suffer from a perceived stereotype around their academic achievement.\n This stereotype informs students that they will not do as well as\n\nAsian and white students because of the color of their skin or their cultural\n\nbackground.\n There is empirical support for this theory.\n Osburne ( 2001) notes that the implications of these theories and\n\nfindings are that if stereotype threat is removed then the racial achievement\n\ngap will close.\n Further testing of this hypothesis has been encouraging and shows\n\nthat without the stereotype threat that students of all colors perform\n\nrelatively the same on tests. \n\n  Cognitive and behavior interventions have been used\n\ncross-culturally and with both genders ( Bodas and Ollenick, 2005 and Ergene,\n\n2003).\n These interventions have proven successful in reducing test anxiety\n\nin many different groups of people.\n I feel that a group intervention that uses cognitive restructuring\n\ntechniques and skills-focused training will benefit a many different types of\n\npeople.\n This group might be most helpful for women and students of color.\n As in the research stated above women often show higher levels of\n\nanxiety around academic achievement so this group will help them decrease\n\nthat anxiety in order to perform well on the exam.\n I think that students of color will also benefit from this group\n\nbecause of the research on stereotype threat.\n Stereotype threat causes students think that they cannot do well on\n\na test.\n The group will address this thinking with cognitive restructuring\n\nand through changing this negative thinking be able to decrease text anxiety.\n This group may not be the best fit for students who are from\n\nnon-Western cultures.\n Though these students have been shown to experience similar levels\n\nof test anxiety they have been found to often feel shame around this anxiety.\n A group setting might not be the most optimal for them as they may\n\nfeel ashamed to admit their anxious feelings.\n Men may also not be the best fit for the group because studies show\n\nthat men have a harder time expressing their emotions around test anxiety.\n However, though these studies inform my understanding of who will\n\nbest be served by this group I also feel that I should acknowledge my\n\npersonal experience of being a student at CUSSW and my knowledge of my\n\nclassmates.\n I feel that this program will be optimal for most students at CUSSW\n\nbecause as aspiring social workers most students are in touch with their\n\nemotions and are able to express them to others.\n I think that this group will adequately serve any individual who is\n\nexperiencing test taking anxiety.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "54b151ad-ab37-4649-bafe-2a15d6889f33", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.714610+00:00"}
{"text": "Spurred on by the passage of the landmark welfare reform\n\nlegislation - - the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity\n\nReconciliation Act of 1996 - - States have made tremendous progress toward\n\nthe critical goal of moving families from welfare to work.\n More families are entering employment, earnings are up, and caseloads\n\nare down. \n\n  The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF) program has\n\ngiven States new opportunities to develop and implement creative and\n\ninnovative strategies and approaches to remove families from a cycle of\n\ndependency on public assistance and into work.\n For example, many are turning welfare offices into comprehensive\n\nservice centers focused on work or changing policies so that work pays. \n\n  However, in spite of some dramatic results, there are still\n\nindividuals not working or in entry-level jobs, with incomes that are too low\n\nor too erratic to raise their families above poverty.\n Under TANF, States have the flexibility and resources to develop\n\nprograms that reach all families, promote success at work, and convert\n\nwelfare offices into job centers.\n The task of welfare reform is far from finished.\n We encourage States to take the critical next steps to ensure that all\n\nfamilies get the essential supports they need to get a job, succeed at work,\n\nand move out of poverty. \n\n  The TANF program provides extraordinary flexibility for funding a\n\nwide variety of employment and training activities, supportive services, and\n\nbenefits that will enable clients to get a job, keep a job, and improve their\n\neconomic circumstances.\n TANF funds are much more flexible than funds under the prior\n\nentitlement programs.\n So States should start with the assumption that they may use these\n\nfunds in innovative ways to achieve the critical goals laid out in the TANF\n\nstatute.\n\n  As a general rule, States ( or local governments and other\n\nagencies where decision-making has devolved from the State agency) must use\n\nthe available funds for eligible, needy families with a child and for one of\n\nthe four purposes of the TANF program:\n\n  1. To provide assistance to needy families; To end dependence of\n\nneedy parents by promoting job preparation, work and marriage; To prevent and\n\nreduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and To encourage the formation and\n\nmaintenance of two-parent families.\n\n  States must use objective criteria for determining eligibility\n\nand benefits.\n However, they may decide the income and resource standards that they\n\nwill use to determine eligibility, and they may set different financial\n\neligibility criteria for different benefits or services.\n ( For example, they could limit eligibility for cash assistance to\n\nfamilies living below poverty, but provide supportive services like child\n\ncare and transportation to working families with incomes up to 185% of\n\npovert%.) Further, since individuals do not have an entitlement to TANF\n\nbenefits, States may elect to target benefits to families with incomes below\n\ntheir established eligibility guidelines.\n\n  States fund their TANF programs with a combination of Federal and\n\nState funds.\n While both are very flexible, the two sources of funds entail\n\nsomewhat different rules and restrictions.\n\n  Federal TANF Funds. If States use Federal funds provided through\n\ntheir TANF block grants to provide \" assistance,\" recipients are subject to\n\nwork and participation requirements, a five-year time limit on Federal\n\nassistance, data reporting, and certain prohibitions.\n But these restrictions do not generally apply to other services and\n\nbenefits that are not \" assistance.\" Also, States have broad discretion to\n\nprovide a wide range of benefits and services and to set different\n\neligibility standards for the different types of benefits. \n\n  State \" maintenance-of-effort\" ( MOE) funds.\n States must spend 80% of their his%oric level of spending ( FY 1994)\n\n- - or 75% if they meet%work participation requirements - - on \" qualified\n\nState expenditures\" to meet the basic MOE requirement.\n\n\n  This guide suggests some of the many flexible ways States may\n\nexpend their Federal TANF and State MOE funds to further the purposes of the\n\nTANF program.\n These examples are by no means exhaustive.\n They merely serve to illustrate a few of the possibilities that State\n\nand local agencies, State legislators, communities, community-based\n\norganizations, and advocates may consider when designing an array of\n\nbenefits, services, and supports that will accomplish one of the four\n\npurposes of the TANF program.\n We hope that the principles and illustrations in this guidance will\n\npromote the design of creative and innovative programs that effectively\n\naddress the needs of low-income families.\n\n  Introduction provides some background information, explaining\n\nwhat progress has been made on welfare reform, what the funding situation is,\n\nthe purposes of TANF, and the purpose of this guide.\n\n  Considerations in Deciding Whether A Use of Funds is Appropriate\n\npresents a list of factors which a State would consider in deciding what\n\nbenefits and services to fund with Federal or State dollars.\n\n  Federal TANF Funds addresses the basic criteria that apply to the\n\nexpenditure of the Federal block grant funds. \n\n  State Maintenance-of-Effort ( MOE) Funds addresses the basic\n\ncriteria for determining whether State expenditures would count as part of\n\nthe minimum State financial contribution to the TANF program.\n\n  Appropriate Uses of Funds provides numerous examples of benefits\n\nand services that might be paid for with Federal TANF or State MOE funds.\n\n  Additional Considerations provides more detailed information\n\nabout the potential implications of providing \" assistance\" and other kinds\n\nof benefits under the TANF program.\n It also provides more detailed information about what kinds of\n\nexpenditures are allowable.\n\n  General Guidance and References identifies additional sources of\n\ninformation about the appropriate use of Federal and State funds.\n It also includes a chart summarizing the specific program\n\nrequirements that would apply under different State program designs. \n\n  We hope that this guide will facilitate the development and\n\nsharing of creative ideas, and we invite States to send us information about\n\nsuccessful strategies and innovative approaches.\n We will post them on our Internet page ( www.acf.dhhs.gov) so that\n\neveryone can benefit from this information.\n Also, we encourage contact with Regional Office or Central Office\n\nstaff who are available to answer any fiscal or policy questions about\n\nstrategies being considered.\n\n \n\n  The purpose of this guide is to show how States may use Federal\n\nTANF and State MOE funds to support working families and to address the needs\n\nof clients with barriers to self-sufficiency.\n The flexibility available under TANF presents new opportunities for\n\nfunding a greater variety of activities, services, and benefits and for\n\nfostering new collaborative partnerships. \n\n  Because the funding of TANF is complex, State agencies,\n\nadvocates, community groups, and State legislators may be unsure about the\n\narray of options available.\n Therefore, we developed this guide as a ready reference tool that\n\nwould promote creative thinking about potential services, supports, and\n\nactivities that States might adopt to further the purposes of the TANF\n\nprogram.\n\n  This guide presents examples of the many flexible ways States may\n\nuse TANF and MOE funds to further the purposes of the TANF program.\n It does not contain new rules or policies.\n Although it summarizes the general limitations and prohibitions on\n\nthe use of funds, we do not intend for it to serve as a definitive policy\n\nmanual.\n States and locales should review the recently issued final rules and\n\nconsult with Regional Office or Central Office staff if they have fiscal or\n\npolicy questions about strategies they are considering. \n\n  The guide does not attempt to identify all possible appropriate\n\nuses of TANF and MOE funds, but simply provides a list of representative\n\nexamples.\n Omission of a particular activity or service from the list does not\n\nnecessarily mean that associated expenditures are not allowable.\n Also, inclusion of a particular example does not mean that such\n\nexpenditures are categorically allowable, under all funding streams or for\n\nall types of recipients.\n\n  Over the past several years, States have made great progress\n\ntoward the critical goal of moving families from welfare to work, spurred on\n\nby the passage of the landmark Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity\n\nReconciliation Act of 1996 ( PRWORA).\n\n\n  The TANF program has expanded the opportunities States have to\n\ndevelop and implement creative and innovative strategies and approaches to\n\nremove families from the cycle of dependency on public assistance and into\n\nwork.\n Across the country, we are seeing welfare offices transformed into\n\ncomprehensive service centers focused on work.\n Case managers are being energized by their success in helping\n\nfamilies find jobs and enter the economic mainstream.\n States have dramatically improved policies to help ensure that work\n\npays.\n For example, they are allowing families to keep a larger share of\n\ntheir earnings, supplementing the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit with\n\nrefundable State credits, allowing ownership of more reliable automobiles,\n\nhelping families accumulate assets through Individual Development Accounts,\n\nand investing new resources in child care services.\n\n  The proportion of people who are working after receiving\n\nassistance is much higher than in the past. \n\n  A variety of \" leaver\" studies conducted by the States show that\n\n50-65% of families %eaving the rolls are working afterwards. \n\n  The latest Census Bureau statistics show that nearly one-third of\n\nthe families that were on welfare in 1997 were working in March of 1998 -\n\nthat 's 1.5 million working parents. \n\n  Eighteen percent of clients receiving assistance now have\n\nearnings, more than double the level in 1993. \n\n  The amount of monthly earnings for these welfare families who are\n\nworking is up from a monthly average of\n\n&dollar;450 in fiscal year 1996 to\n\n&dollar;592 in the last quarter of fiscal year 1997. \n\n  The number of individuals on welfare has been reduced by 46%\n\nsince President Clinton took office. \n\n  Even with these dramatic results, there are still individuals\n\nwithout work or in entry-level jobs.\n While these jobs typically pay more than welfare, they may leave\n\nfamilies with incomes that are too low or too erratic to escape poverty.\n Some studies are showing that, within a year of finding jobs, 30-40%\n\nof families are back on assistance or still combining welfare with work.\n\n  It is clear that poverty is significantly correlated with bad\n\nresults for families: poor nutrition and health, unsafe housing, dangerous\n\nneighborhoods, and inadequate cognitive development of children.\n Recent findings from the New Hope demonstration program in Milwaukee\n\ndemonstrate that investments in working families - - particularly child care\n\nand health care - - can yield very impressive results in helping families\n\nsucceed in jobs and improve the well-being of children.\n\n  Under TANF, States have the flexibility and resources to\n\ncontribute to these kinds of investments.\n\n  To succeed over the long run, collaboration among a range of\n\ncommunity organizations and of governmental agencies must occur to address\n\nhow best to serve clients with needs such as developmental disabilities,\n\nlearning problems, substance abuse, mental health problems, rural isolation,\n\nand domestic violence.\n\n  States decide the services or benefits that are to be provided\n\nusing their Federal and State funds.\n A State must use all of its Federal TANF and State MOE funds to meet\n\none of the four purposes articulated in the Federal TANF statute or, in the\n\ncase of the Federal TANF funds, to continue providing services and benefits\n\nthat it was authorized to provide under its former title IV-A or IV-F State\n\nplans ( which covered Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC),\n\nEmergency Assistance ( EA), Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (\n\nJOBS), and Supportive Services).\n A State may use its TANF or MOE funds for services and benefits that\n\ndirectly lead to ( or can be expected to lead to) the accomplishment of one\n\nof these four purposes.\n For example, it could fund special initiatives to improve the\n\nmotivation, performance, and self-esteem of youth ( e.g., activities like\n\nthose included in the HHS Girl Power! Campaign or sponsored by the Boys and\n\nGirls Clubs) because such initiatives would be expected to reduce school-\n\ndropout and teen pregnancy rates.\n\n  Both sources of funding provide significant resources for States\n\nto invest in the services that families need to move from welfare to work,\n\nstay in the workforce, and move out of poverty.\n States have received tremendous financial benefits from the\n\nflexibility available under TANF and the strong economy.\n Many States have unobligated TANF funds available, giving them an\n\nunprecedented opportunity to invest in families with significant barriers to\n\nemployment, provide additional supports for low-income working families, or\n\ndesign pregnancy prevention and family formation programs. \n\n  In deciding how to best use their TANF and MOE funds, it is\n\ncritical that State agencies, including agencies such as child support,\n\ntransportation, housing, and child care, develop strong collaborative\n\nrelationships with businesses, local agencies, and community organizations in\n\ndeveloping strategies and delivering services.\n While States have been enormously successful in placing millions of\n\nclients into work, efforts must extend to reach all needy families, including\n\nthose that face multiple barriers to success and who face time limits for\n\nreceiving public assistance.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ad4b3a02-1829-4dad-811c-b48f04b35596", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.716216+00:00"}
{"text": "Tour ten advanced house designs from our neighbor to the north.\n Their technologies may appear in U.S.\n\n\n  Probably because of its cold climate, Canada is a world leader in\n\nenergy-efficient housing.\n The United States is five to ten years behind its neighbor, most\n\nhousing experts agree.\n So POPULAR SCIENCE went to Canada to learn about a group of\n\nstate-of-the-art homes, dubbed Advanced Houses.\n\n  Ten Advanced Houses, winners of a nationwide competition, have\n\nbeen constructed across Canada.\n Entrants met stringent requirements: The houses will use half as much\n\nenergy as those in the well-regarded R-2000 program that Canada has been\n\npushing for a decade, and one-fourth the energy and half the water of\n\nconventional homes.\n Builders also focused on indoor air quality and resource-conserving\n\nmaterials choices.\n\n  These targets were met in different ways.\n \" Each house is not the archetypical house of the future, but one set\n\nof solutions,\" explains Tim Mayo of Canada 's energy department.\n Intended as benchmarks for the Canadian building industry, the houses\n\nare the proving ground for new technologies and products that should drive\n\nfuture housing development.\n Seven of eight windows that were prototyped for the project are now\n\non the market, for example.\n \" We're trying t 'reush the mainstream industry as far as it can go,\n\nand then just a bit further,\" says Mayo.\n Looking at the group of Advanced Houses as a whole, it is easy to\n\nidentify some emerging trends:\n\n  * Builders are using more engineered-wood products.\n Premanufactured truss walls comprised of inner and outer wood studs\n\nseparated by plywood webs or metal spacers were used in three houses, for\n\nexample.\n This allows for wall cavities up to 12 inches deep, but uses only\n\nsmall-dimension lumber.\n\n\n  * Six houses are insulated with recycled materials such as\n\ncellulose, which is made from waste newsprint.\n Two houses use newer, high-density fiberglass batts that contain some\n\nrecycled glass.\n\n  * Three houses feature quadruple-glazed windows with gas fills,\n\nnon-metal spacers, and low-emissivity coatings that reflect heat but transmit\n\nvisible light.\n\n\n  * The houses integrate space heating, cooling, ventilation, and\n\nwater heating.\n Ground-source heat pumps provide heating and cooling in three houses.\n Another four use high-efficiency systems that integrate gas heating\n\nand domestic-hot-water requirements.\n\n \n\n  * Renewable energy sources are gaining a foothold.\n Solar panels heat water for six houses; five of the six also have\n\nphotovoltaic-powered pumps.\n Solar energy generates electricity for two houses; another one has\n\nwind power.\n\n  * All but two of the houses incorporate some type of\n\nhome-automation system to control lighting, security, heating and cooling,\n\nand more.\n\n  The Advanced Houses will be open to the public for a year, then\n\nsold, and finally monitored for a year under normal occupancy.\n Although the houses rely on a variety of experimental technology,\n\nthey don't look out of place in neighborhoods of conventional homes.\n Each house 's total project cost was about\n\n&dollar;700,000 to\n\n&dollar;800,000 ( Canadian); much of the expense comes from designing and installing\n\nprototypes, which can be more costly than off-the-shelf products.\n The houses will sell for prices typical in their neighborhoods; the\n\nthree that have already sold went for\n\n&dollar;185,000 to\n\n&dollar;250,000 ( Canadian).\n Here are some innovative features a visitor might see on a quick tour\n\nof the houses.\n\n\n  Indoor air quality received special attention in the design of\n\nthe Manitoba Advanced House in Winnipeg.\n The hobby room, which could also serve as a home office or smoker 's\n\nroom, has its own ventilation system.\n Other \" healthy house\" touches include a special bag filter to\n\ncapture particles, floors made from natural cork, a basement floor sealed to\n\nprevent the entry of radon ( a naturally occurring soil gas that may be\n\nimplicated in some lung cancers), and return air vents located in the closets\n\nto remove dry-cleaning fumes and other pollutants.\n\n  The Manitoba House needs no air conditioning.\n During the summer, overhangs help keep sunlight from penetrating\n\nwindows.\n The windows also have clip-on solar screens that look similar to\n\nregular screens but reduce heat gain by about 30 percent.\n\n  Although temperatures in Winnipeg can drop to - 40 [ degrees] F\n\nin the winter, the house 's windows gain more energy than they lose--even on\n\nthe colder north side.\n To find the best windows for the job, the team that built the house\n\nheld a competition.\n The winner: quadruple-glazed Willmar windows with two Heat Mirror\n\npolyester films, an additional low-emissivity coating on the inner pane of\n\nglass, insulative spacer bars, and a gas fill that is 80 percent krypton and\n\n20 percent argon.\n The windows have an insulative value of R-12, which is as good as\n\nsome conventional walls, says project manager John Hockman of Appin\n\nAssociates.\n Now on the market, they cost about 40 percent more than triple-glazed\n\nwindows, which are standard in new Winnipeg homes.\n\n  Other details include a natural-gas refueling station next to the\n\ngarage, an under-sink compost handler that is kept under negative air\n\npressure to prevent odors from escaping, and an energy-use meter that helps\n\nreduce consumption by telling occupants how much electricity they're using 're\n\ndollars.\n\n\n  The four-bedroom Saskatchewan Advanced House in Saskatoon makes\n\nample use of solar energy.\n A photovoltaic panel on the roof generates 1.9 kilowatts, about 10\n\npercent of the electricity used in the house.\n The panel provides enough juice to run a Photocom refrigerator, which\n\nuses about one-third the electricity of an average fridge ( typically the\n\nbiggest energy gobbler in a house).\n The photovoltaics also power the heating and cooling systems.\n\n\n  Evacuated heat-pipe solar collectors on the roof capture heat and\n\ntransfer it to a 750-gallon insulated water-storage tank in the basement.\n From there, the heat passively rises into a pair of domestic\n\nhot-water tanks mounted on top of the storage tank.\n These two tanks provide hot water for the kitchen, bathrooms, and\n\nlaundry.\n Via a heat exchanger, they also transfer heat to water circulating\n\nthrough a radiant-floor-heating system.\n The two hot-water tanks provide backup heat when the solar storage\n\ntank in the basement can't meet the demand.\n \" This is a very simple system,\" claims designer John Carroll.\n\n\n  The Saskatchewan House also has radiant cooling, which, unlike\n\nconventional air conditioners, requires no CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons.\n Water is pumped through 2,300 feet of tubing in the ceilings of the\n\nmain and upstairs levels, where it picks up heat from aluminum collector\n\nplates.\n The water then flows through another 1,600 feet of tubing buried in\n\nthe ground beneath the floor slab and in the backfill.\n Cooled to about 50 [ degrees] F by the soil, the water recirculates\n\nto the ceilings.\n\n  To conserve water, the backyard 's concave shape channels the flow\n\ntoward the grass to water the yard.\n\n\n  Located in the Vancouver suburb of Surrey, the British Columbia\n\nAdvanced House uses a variety of prefabricated components.\n The second-floor walls and the roof are made from stress-skin panels,\n\nwhich are stronger than conventional double-stud walls, require less lumber,\n\nand can be mass-produced.\n \" What we're real 'redoing is moving the construction off site and\n\ninto the factory, where there 's better quality control and more efficient\n\nmaterials use,\" explains architect Richard Kadulski.\n\n  Each stress-skin panel has a layer of HCFC-blown polyurethane\n\nsandwiched between two sheets of plywood.\n Because they are manufactured using HCFCs ( hydrochlorofluorocarbons)\n\ninstead of CFCs, the panels are potentially less damaging to Earth 's ozone\n\nlayer.\n\n  Strolling around the house, an informed visitor can spot many\n\nrecycled materials.\n The foundation and landscaping contain crushed glass, the rubber\n\npavers are made from old tires, and the deck is recycled plastic.\n The roof tiles, developed by Vancouver-based C-Max Technologies, are\n\nparticularly noteworthy.\n They look like slate, but are made from a fire-retardant\n\nweather-resistant combination of two waste products: pulp sludge produced by\n\nlocal mills, and a cementlike material made from a fertilizer byproduct.\n\n  Local inventors devised two other products.\n The Touch Tap in the shower allows occupants to preset the\n\ntemperature and flow rate for each person in the house, says Kadulski.\n And the Ventex toilet, with a fan that vents odors from the bowl\n\nthrough a pipe to the outside, removes about 85 percent less air than a\n\nbathroom ceiling fan.\n\n\n  Household waste goes into a tank buried under the front lawn,\n\nwhere microorganisms break down the solid materials.\n Only the liquids continue on to the city sewer system, reducing the\n\nneed for municipal waste treatment.\n\n  The most sophisticated element of the house is its\n\nhome-automation system.\n The house is prewired so that appliances can \" talk\" to each other.\n If the doorbell or telephone rings, for example, the vacuum cleaner\n\nautomatically stops.\n\n\n  The Waterloo Region Green Home, located an hour west of Toronto\n\nin Waterloo, Ontario, takes what some have called a \" low-tech\" approach to\n\nenergy efficiency and environmental responsibility.\n \" We consider that a compliment,\" says project manager John Kokko of\n\nEnermodal Engineering Ltd.\n\n  The project team used no CFCs in the house, and selected a\n\nvariety of recycled materials including: siding made from sawdust, a steel\n\nroof made from junked cars, carpeting made from plastic soda bottles, and a\n\nrefurbished bathtub and sink.\n\n  One of the team 's goals was to virtually eliminate construction\n\nwaste.\n \" We never had a dumpster on site,\" says Stephen Carpenter of\n\nEnermodal.\n While builders typically send about 2.5 tons of waste to the landfill\n\nfor every house they erect, the Waterloo team generated just two garbage bags\n\nweighing about ten pounds apiece.\n\n  The team used only half the concrete that would be required for a\n\npoured-in-place foundation by adapting engineered concrete wall panels for\n\nthe foundation.\n Flat on one side, the precast panels have steel reinforcing on the\n\nother, wafflelike side to give them the strength of a conventional\n\nfoundation.\n\n  The house 's heating system, developed with the Canadian Gas\n\nResearch Institute, uses a conventional natural-gas furnace joined to a\n\nheat-recovery ventilator ( HRV) with two briefcase-size containers of gravel.\n Furnace flue gases and ventilation exhaust from the bathrooms heat\n\none set of rocks, while the second set of rocks heats incoming fresh air.\n Every five minutes, a pair of valves reverses the airflow to the two\n\ncompartments, so the heated rocks are cooled, and the cooled rocks are\n\nheated.\n Because the rocks are cheaper than a stainless-steel heat exchanger,\n\nthe furnace/HRV system could be manufactured less expensively than its\n\ncompetitors.\n\n\n  One innovation Kokko and Carpenter can't resist pointing out is\n\na \" toilet with a twist.? Made by Control Fluidics of Greenwich, Conn.,\n\nthe Fluidizer toilet contains a blenderlike device that liquefies solid waste\n\nand toilet paper.\n The patented toilet uses just two quarts of water for each flush;\n\nother low-flush toilets use one and a half gallons, and standard models use\n\nthree gallons.\n The Fluidizer could become commercially available as early as\n\nJune.\n\n\n  Metal-web trusses are premanufactured units commonly used in\n\nfloors.\n \" Stand that floor system on its side, and you've go 've wall,\" says\n\nPaul Duffy, an engineer at Buchan, Lawton, Parent Ltd. in Toronto, and\n\nproject manager of The Novel Environmental Advanced Technology Home, or NEAT\n\nHome, in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n  Truss walls provide high levels of insulation without requiring\n\nincreasingly scarce and expensive large-dimension lumber.\n \" There 's nothing bigger than a 2x5 in the whole house,\" says\n\nDuffy.\n\n  The NEAT Home 's 11-inch-thick walls consist of 2x3 studs\n\nseparated by a metal web.\n They'r 'reovered with insulative foam sheathing on the outside, and\n\ndrywall on the inside.\n The wall cavities are filled with a poured-in-place non-CFC foam.\n \" It expands up to 60 times its volume,\" says Duffy.\n Specially formulated for this project by Icynene Inc. of\n\nMississauga, Ontario, the foam flows easily around the framing materials but\n\ndoes not build up enough pressure to force off the drywall or sheathing.\n It shrinks less than three percent as it dries, to prevent\n\ninsulative gaps.\n Builders put scraps of excess foam into the attic before blowing\n\nrecycled fiberglass insulation into place.\n\n  For the foundation, the project team adapted a technology\n\ncommonly used in high-rise construction.\n \" It 's never been tried in a residential foundation application,\"\n\nsays Duffy.\n To build the foundation walls, workers used tie rods to position\n\nrigid insulation and a fiberglass drainage layer between concrete forms.\n They then poured two layers of concrete to form a sandwich around\n\nthe insulation.\n The outer concrete layer supports above-grade masonry finish, and\n\nthe inside layer supports the house framing.\n There 's no need for any exterior or interior finishing of the\n\nfoundation walls.\n\n\n  To accommodate changing family needs, the NEAT Home has an\n\noversize garage door that allows the owner to add a roll-in suite to the\n\nhouse.\n This suite, which arrives on the site completed like a manufactured\n\nhome, contains a bedroom, kitchenette, and bathroom.\n Plumbing and mechanical hookups on the garage wall ease\n\ninstallation.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f44880d1-6913-40ae-9b3e-6d8ebef499df", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.717464+00:00"}

{"text": "1) Due to the exclusion acts set against Chinese immigrants throughout\n\nthe 19th and 20th century, Chinese parents feel that their children will\n\nsuffer from the same discrimination they experienced upon arriving to the\n\nUnited States.\n Therefore, the parents \" soon discovered that being Chinese was a\n\nliability.\n Parents saw it in their own lives, and they foresaw it for their\n\nchildren.\n Their hope was that education would blunt the edge of discrimination\n\nfor the next generation\" ( Louie 57).\n With the fear of the glass ceiling effect, which is the belief that\n\nChinese immigrants would not be able to obtain higher positions in their\n\nemployment due to their race or social class, Chinese parents place intense\n\npressure on their children to succeed in the educational setting through\n\nfamilial and cultural pressure.\n In turn, this presents the Chinese people as the model minority in the\n\nUnited States.\n\n  In Chinese culture, they tend to follow Confucius values, which\n\nplace emphasis on the relationship between the individual and society,\n\nreverence for the family and elders, hard work, and knowing one 's place in\n\ntheir family, community, and society ( Zhou, lecture 5 and 8).\n With the focus on filial piety, a child must have respect and complete\n\nobedience to their parents, creating a strict, disciplined and\n\npressure-filled household.\n Thus, a child?s \" educational success is very much tied to\n\nface-saving for the traditional Chinese family\" ( \" Chinese Schools\" 3).\n Since children must obey their parents, they are under significant\n\npressure to succeed educationally, because it acts as a duty and obligation\n\nto the family as opposed to individual achievement.\n For parents, they realize that their children may be limited in a\n\nstructural sense, such as through limited family wealth, lack of available\n\nsocial networks that connect to the American economy, and barriers to\n\nemployment through racial stereotypes and discrimination ( ibid).\n Also, parents also take advantage of the American educational system\n\nby \" parachuting\" their children, in which they send their children at a\n\nyoung age to the United States to live with relatives in order to receive a\n\nbetter education and obtain better jobs as they grow older\" ( \" Parachute\"\n\n1).\n The pressure instilled through Chinese parents causes most of the\n\nchildren to succeed for their parents so that they can justify the hardships\n\ntheir parents endured through their immigration experience.\n Simultaneously, it also may cause some children to rebel and have\n\nnegative relationships with their parents.\n\n  As Chinese immigrants began to enter the United States during the\n\ntime of exclusion, they created Chinatowns, originally known as \" bachelor\n\nsocieties,\" which are ethnic communities located in inner cities that\n\nprovided social networks for immigrants.\n In Chinatown, Chinese schools were created to \" preserve language and\n\ncultural heritage in the second and succeeding generations\" ( \" Chinese\n\nSchools\" 4).\n Once exclusion ceased and Chinese immigrants began to reside in\n\nsuburbs, Chinese schools became nonprofit ethnic organizations, which acted\n\nas supplementary education that children attended alongside their American\n\neducation.\n At the schools, they incorporate Chinese education while helping with\n\nstandardized test preparation, such as the SAT, offering \" a more\n\ncomprehensive, well-rounded curriculum\" ( \" Chinese Schools\" 9).\n With expected parental involvement, the schools? main goal is to help\n\nimmigrant children succeed in American public schools to attend prestigious\n\nhigher education and secure a decent living through high-status professional\n\njobs.\n\n  Through the pressure from Chinese parents and an intense\n\neducational system, Chinese children have been succeeding in schools,\n\nattending prestigious universities, and obtaining high-level jobs.\n Consequently, this had formed Asian Americans as a model minority,\n\nwhich supports the conservative concept of the American Dream and presents\n\nthe idea that minorities can succeed in the United States despite legal and\n\nsocial hardships.\n Because the Chinese were historically discriminated against in the\n\npast, the fact that they are successful justifies the idea that the American\n\nsystem is devoid of racism, which de-legitimizes other minorities' struggles.\n In reality, many cultural and structural factors contribute to Asian\n\nAmerican 's success.\n\n  2) When Chinese exclusion first occurred in 1882, ethnic\n\ncommunities like Chinatowns acted as a social network for Chinese immigrants,\n\nwhere family, merchant, and district associations formed, connecting\n\nimmigrants from the same region and with the same dialect to help them\n\nsituate more comfortably in the United States.\n In contemporary societies, the ethnic communities have transformed as\n\nChinese immigrants are entering the United States with higher education and\n\nchildren are having greater access to Chinese schools, which increase their\n\nchances of obtaining higher education, causing a flux of movement into\n\nsuburbs rather than Chinatowns.\n Thus, the organizations have focused more on settlement and\n\nassimilation, providing resources for the Chinese community, which in turn\n\nreceives aid from ethnic entrepreneurship.\n\n  A feeling of ethnic solidarity formed from exclusion through the\n\nethnic communities, which provide employment opportunities for immigrants\n\nlacking human capital, such as English-speaking skills, job experience, and\n\nemployment networks to the mainstream economy ( \" Paradox of Ethnicization\"\n\n246).\n For instance, for Chinese women immigrating to the United States\n\nlacking a proficiency in English and job skills, ethnic communities offer\n\nemployment opportunities in the garment industry since it requires little\n\nexperience, English-speaking, and enables her to contribute financially to\n\nthe family as well as attend to her household obligations.\n Consequently, Chinatowns are \" considered an alternative path to\n\nsocial mobility\" ( \" Other Half\" 16).\n Also, ethnic communities strengthen networks and create community\n\norganization opportunities for immigrants ( \" Paradox of Ethnicization\" 239).\n For example, non-profit organizations run by educated immigrants or\n\nthe children of immigrants provide a variety of services such as English\n\nclasses, job training centers, health clinics, welfare and housing agencies,\n\nand daycare.\n Thus, the leaders of the organizations \" are more concerned with\n\ninterethnic relations, citizen and immigrant rights, equality, and the\n\ngeneral well-being of the community\" ( \" Paradox of Ethnicization 241).\n Correspondingly, these support networks and groups are more focused\n\non assimilation rather than segregation from the mainstream society.\n\n  The ethnic communities act as a place of resources, tangible and\n\nintangible, for Chinese immigrants.\n With many immigrants attempting to have upward social mobility, they\n\nare more likely to run their own businesses, which contributes to an \" ethnic\n\ngroup 's maintenance of'a controlling ownership stake'\" ( \" Immigrant\n\nEntrepreneurship\" 2).\n Not only do self-run businesses contribute to the overall economy and\n\nself-sufficiency of the ethnic communities but they also provide employment\n\nopportunities for Chinese immigrants, especially those who do not have the\n\nskills or speaking ability to enter the mainstream work force.\n This organizational support offers social capital for immigrants,\n\nproviding \" a dense network of secondary associations, trust, and norms in\n\ncreating and sustaining a sense of civic community\" ( \" Community\n\nTransformation\" 2).\n Economically, the employment opportunities could cultivate a sense of\n\nentrepreneurial spirit, preparing workers to eventually start their own\n\nbusinesses despite their socioeconomic status.\n By increasing their financial capital, ethnic communities aid in\n\nmoving immigrants out of Chinatowns to affluent suburbs.\n\n  As the economy arises, so does the ethnic community as a whole,\n\nwhich represents a labor market focused on services and ethnic-specific goods\n\nthat are only accessible to the community.\n Ethnic entrepreneurs, who are simultaneously owners and managers of\n\ntheir own businesses and tied to a common cultural heritage realized by\n\nout-group members, fulfill the immigrant dream of owning their own business,\n\nwhich in turn helps them acquire their other dream of owning a house.\n Whether they are middleman minorities ( entrepreneurs who trade in\n\nbetween a society 's elite and the masses) or ethnic-enclave entrepreneurs (\n\nthose bounded by co-ethnicity, co-ethnic social structures, and location),\n\nethnic entrepreneurs provide a variety of benefits for Chinese immigrants,\n\nsuch as offering employment for those suffering from discrimination in the\n\nmainstream workforce, allowing for workers to receive more pay through\n\nworking longer hours, helping women balance labor and familial obligations,\n\nand creating the sense of easier attainment of job opportunities ( \"\n\nImmigrant Entrepreneurship\").\n In effect, ethnic communities set the stage for entrepreneurs and\n\nimmigrants to mutually benefit from one another, making the communities an\n\nideal place for assimilation into the mainstream economy.\n\n  3) For both Phillip Guo and Eric Liu, their ethnic identities\n\nwere shaped by the way others viewed them in American society and the\n\ndifferences that emerged when they were compared to people belonging to other\n\nracial categories.\n With two different backgrounds, Guo and Liu experienced their\n\nidentity when they interacted with others in different settings, realizing\n\nthat historical stereotypes against Chinese immigrants plague all Asian\n\nAmericans in present day. \n\n  As a Chinese-born immigrant, Guo was constantly immigrating to\n\nvarious countries and states throughout his childhood, such as to\n\nSwitzerland, Louisiana, New York, and California.\n In each area, he always experienced the feeling of being the only or\n\none of the few Asian Americans in the group.\n Additionally, he felt that Americans often classified people under\n\numbrellas of racial categories, stating that \" Americans use the term white\n\nto describe people from a white variety of European ancestries\" ( Guo 32); as\n\nsuch, the same is applied to Asian Americans as well.\n Upon immigrating to the United States, he soon found that the\n\nlabeling of Americans as white played a significant part in the labeling of\n\nhis own identity.\n While attending elementary school in Louisiana, Guo discovered that\n\nhe \" was branded as white simply because [ he] was told to be white by a\n\nnon-white person.\n [ And for him], becoming American meant becoming white\" ( Guo 110).\n Consequently, he grew accustomed to masking the traits that made him\n\ndifferent from his friends in order to allow him to fit in with his friends.\n Additionally, he felt that certain ideas, such as a stay-at-home\n\nmother and attending religious services on Sundays, would make him \" more\n\nAmerican.\"\n Since he did not have such traits, he realized that he \" could never\n\nbe white since [ he] was not born that way\" ( Guo 67).\n Although his childhood friends always made him feel welcome, Guo knew\n\nhe was different and did not like himself for it; these feelings\n\nunfortunately stemmed from the identity created through his interactions and\n\nlabeling by others.\n\n  As a second generation Chinese immigrant, Eric Liu realizes the\n\nsituational aspect of his identity, knowing that his identity as a Chinese\n\nperson depends on the context in which he is placed.\n For him, context plays a large role in how Chinese people are viewed,\n\nand he understands that historical stereotypes affect how people categorize\n\nhim.\n Similar to Guo 's experience of categorization, Liu hypothesizes, \"\n\nMaybe we're ha 'reired to sort by groups\" ( Liu 170).\n Similarly, he admits that his \" Asian American identity was born [\n\njust as he was], roughly thirty years ago\" ( Liu 57), suggesting that\n\nidentities are alive in America and shape people as soon as they are born.\n Although he was always proud to be linked to the great Chinese\n\ncivilization and never felt the difference between being Chinese and\n\nAmerican, he felt the difficulties of growing up Chinese American in his\n\nlooks, love-life, and manners.\n Accordingly, as a middle-class, suburban resident, he certainly saw\n\nthe differences between himself and those who resided in Chinatown, which\n\nconnected him more so to his American identity than to his Chinese identity.\n Hence, there was a significant conflict in Liu 's life between his\n\nChinese and American realms, despite his feeling of connectedness between the\n\ntwo, because of the way society portrays the two realms.\n Through this conflict, Liu is described as a \" banana,\" in which he\n\nis Chinese on the outside and white on the inside, supporting the fact that \"\n\nsome are born white, others achieve whiteness, [ and] still others have\n\nwhiteness thrust upon them\" ( Liu 34-35). \n\n  With Guo and Liu 's experiences and thoughts on what it means to\n\nbe white, they have found that their identities are shaped with their\n\ncomparison to what society classifies as white.\n However, with racial diversity continually expanding in the United\n\nStates and perceptions constantly changing in people 's minds, there is the\n\nfeeling that \" America is white no longer, and it will never be white again\"\n\n( Liu 56).\n\n  4) For Chinese immigrants, obtaining citizenship in the United\n\nStates has always been a difficult feat due to exclusion laws and\n\ndiscrimination.\n Numerous traits can be attributed to being labeled a US citizen, such\n\nas having the right to vote, serve on a jury, or being able to run for public\n\noffice.\n However, citizenship also entails the possession of basic civil\n\nrights, which are more specific than human rights and are \" the rights that\n\nare bestowed by nations on those within their territorial boundaries\" ( Zhou,\n\nlecture 10).\n Nonetheless, possessing membership in the United States is quite\n\ndifferent from citizenship, revealing a difference between being and\n\nbelonging in the country.\n To be a member is more inclusive, in which one feels that they are\n\naccepted by the host country and not just a physical presence with a sense of\n\nexistence in the world.\n With the divide between citizenship and membership, Chinese\n\nimmigrants suffer intense scrutiny because of their race and the past\n\nperceptions of the \" yellow peril\" and \" unassimilated alien.\"\n Accordingly, Wen Ho Lee 's case of espionage presents a concrete\n\nexample of the discrimination and separation one experiences when a negative\n\nlight is shone on Asian people in the United States.\n\n  When US-China relations become negative, all Asian Americans\n\nbecome a target, because two out of three Americans feel negatively towards\n\nChinese Americans ( Lee 330).\n Furthermore, there was no statistical difference with how Americans\n\nviewed Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans in a survey, revealing\n\nthat people tend to group all Asian Americans together in their minds (\n\nibid).\n For Wen Ho Lee, a naturalized US citizen and Taiwanese man charged\n\nfor mishandling sensitive information, the government targeted him when China\n\napparently obtained US information on nuclear weapons.\n Although Lee was Taiwanese, he was immediately viewed as Chinese and\n\nthus the only suspect in the case.\n As an American citizen, he should have been protected by the rights\n\nof the Constitution, but he was treated quite harshly by the government,\n\ncausing Lee to state, \" They should have treated me more like a human being\n\ninstead of just some Chinese dog or cat whose life and reputation means\n\nnothing\" ( Lee 322).\n Therefore, there is a paradox to assimilation with Chinese Americans\n\nbeing viewed as the model minority and \" perpetual foreigner,\" plaguing them\n\nas disloyal and dating back to the days of stereotypes such as the \" yellow\n\nperil\" and \" Fu Manchu,\" which mold Chinese people as scary, dangerous, and a\n\nthreat to the American way of life ( \" Rethinking Assimilation\" 13).\n Because China and the United States have constantly had conflicts in\n\nthe past and one 's racial group status does affect the status of the\n\nindividual, all Asian Americans realize that they become a target of negative\n\nperceptions when relations become sour in the United States.\n\n  The question of whether Lee would have been accused so quickly\n\nand harshly if he were not Chinese resonates quite strongly in the air.\n According to Lee, his situation made him feel that his American Dream\n\ndisappeared ( 328).\n However, he learned one important idea that he strongly shares with\n\nall Asian Americans around the country, which is that \" Chinese American and\n\nAsian American people have to stand up\" ( Lee 329).\n For Eric Liu, a self-proclaimed Chinese American, he feels a sense of\n\nparanoia when negative stereotypes and perceptions of Chinese arise,\n\nrealizing that if he were placed in a suspecting setting, such as the White\n\nHouse, during a national security breach, he may very well be a target for\n\nsocial execution and scrutiny ( Liu 120).\n When the Chinese immigrated to the United States, they experienced\n\ndiscrimination, but with dreams of bringing glory to their family name and\n\nsending money to their families back home, they never believed they would\n\nhave to be involved in politics.\n Unfortunately, there is a significant divide between a Chinese\n\nimmigrant 's sense of belonging and being to a county just as there is between\n\ncitizenship and membership to the United States, which highlights the\n\nnegative mindset many American possess psychologically toward China.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source":

Rork, the attorney who defended Timothy P. Oblander,\n\nwho had the cocaine addiction, was the second witness to be called to the\n\nwitness stand on Monday by Good, a former deputy, who is being tried on two\n\ncharges of felony perjury.\n Good, who was a sergeant when he was fired earlier this year from the\n\nsheriff 's department, is charged with two counts of perjury stemming from his\n\ntestimony on Feb. 22, 1999, and March 10, 1999, in Shawnee County District\n\nCourt during which he denied knowing Oblander had used illegal drugs.\n\n  On Feb. 17, 1999, Oblander signed a release so Rork could look at\n\nOblander 's treatment records at Valley Hope, an alcohol and drug\n\nrehabilitation center at Atchison.\n Rork said he read that Oblander had been treated at the center for\n\ncocaine dependency.\n\n  \" I was shocked,\" Rork said, who testified Oblander earlier told\n\nhim he was treated at Valley Hope for an alcohol problem.\n \" If he had told me the truth, he would never have been charged with a\n\ncrime.\n\n\n  Oblander was charged with six counts of perjury and one count of\n\nofficial misconduct.\n The perjury counts stemmed from lying while testifying on Jan. 20,\n\n1999, and Feb.22, 1999, in district court, court records said.\n The official misconduct charge stemmed from using illegal drugs, then\n\nlying about his drug use, according to court records.\n Oblander agreed to a diversion agreement in exchange for his\n\ntestimony against Good and former Sheriff Dave Meneley.\n\n  About Feb. 26, 1999, Rork told Oblander that the deputy was in a\n\n\" world of trouble\" for lying to the court that he hadn't used cocaine.\n Three days later, Oblander issued a public statement saying he had\n\ndual addictions of cocaine and alcohol.\n\n  Oblander, who was called to the witness stand by Good, testified\n\nthat he told Good about his drug addiction.\n Oblander never told Good about his drug addiction, did he? Robinson\n\nasked Oblander.\n\n  \" Yes, I did,\" Oblander said, \" before I went into treatment\" in\n\nlate June 1995.\n Oblander said he \" gave little detail\" to Good about his drug\n\naddiction.\n\n  In his opening statement, Robinson said jurors would not only\n\nfind Good not guilty but also innocent of the perjury charges.\n\n  Robinson told jurors that charges against Good were a way to get\n\nMeneley, who was Shawnee County sheriff when he was charged with two counts\n\nof perjury in April 1999.\n Two deputies, Detectives Jack Metz and Scott Holladay, have testified\n\nthat Good told them about Oblander 's cocaine addiction and that Meneley knew\n\nabout Oblander 's problem.\n\n  Robinson told jurors he thinks Metz and Holladay learned of\n\nOblander 's drug problem from the drug counselor who was to provide counseling\n\nto Oblander after he finished his one-month treatment at Valley Hope.\n\n  Robinson said Assistant Attorney General James Welch was trying\n\nto make points with Attorney General Carla Stovall when he testified that\n\nGood told him of Oblander 's drug use.\n\n  In February, Meneley was ousted from the sheriff 's office after\n\ntwo Shawnee County District judges ruled that Meneley twice gave false\n\ntestimony while under oath and once concealed evidence, all linked to the\n\nsheriff 's department drug scandal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  That bottled water you stockpiled for Y2K may still come in handy\n\nif northeast Kansas doesn't get rain soon.\n\n  It is a little too early to start filling washtubs with water,\n\nbut the people who watch this sort of thing are beginning to be a little\n\nconcerned.\n\n  Topeka Water Superintendent Don Rankin is keeping watch on the\n\nstatistics on the depth of water in the Kansas River, the only source of\n\ndrinking water for Topeka-area water customers.\n\n  He has the power to impose water conservation measures on those\n\ncustomers but isn't making any predictions on the likelihood of that\n\nhappening.\n\n  The river is low, but he doesn't have any specific depth that\n\nautomatically triggers the water conservation plan.\n\n  \" It 's kind of a relative thing,\" he said.\n \" The river gets this low every year.\n\n\n  Besides watching the depth gauge at the water treatment plant on\n\nthe south bank of the Kansas River near S.W. MacVicar, Rankin also is\n\nwatching some Web sites maintained by various government agencies.\n\n  The Kansas Water Office, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and\n\nU.S. Geological Survey all have Web sites with useful data.\n For example, the Corps of Engineers site showed that the level of\n\nwater in the river dropped to 5.41 feet as of Friday, down from 6.26 feet the\n\nprevious Friday.\n\n  That measurement is taken by a gauge near the Sardou Bridge in\n\nTopeka.\n\n  Two measurements of the river level are used by the government\n\nagencies.\n Besides the depth in feet, the other measurement is the number of\n\ncubic feet of water that pass by a certain point in one second.\n\n  The Corps site showed 1,429 cubic feet per second, or CFS, were\n\nflowing through Topeka on Friday compared with 2,663 CFS the previous\n\nFriday.\n\n  Historical tables supplied by the U.S.\n Geological Survey site show the typical river flows in Topeka range\n\nfrom highs of 70,000 CFS to lows in the range of the current level.\n But as Rankin indicated, the lows typically occur in September, with\n\nsummertime river levels often in the range of 5,000 CFS.\n\n  At the height of the 1993 flooding, 170,000 CFS were flowing\n\nthrough Topeka.\n\n  The Kansas Water Office Web site maintains frequently updated \"\n\nDrought Reports\" indicating the presence or absence of moisture in the\n\nvarious parts of the state.\n The June 7 report placed much of northeast Kansas in the \" severe\n\ndrought\" category, a downgrading of the previous week 's rating of \" moderate\n\ndrought.\"\n\n  Those ratings are based on a numerical system called the Palmer\n\nDrought Severity Index.\n The Palmer index rates an area between +4, meaning extremely wet, and\n\n- 4, meaning extreme drought.\n To be considered in serious drought, an area has to have a Palmer\n\nrating between - 3 and - 3.99. \n\n\n\n\n  For those infected with or affected by the HIV virus or AIDS, a\n\nnew grass-roots service is available that uses a different approach from\n\nother social services.\n\n  Sojourn, a nonprofit organization located at 817 S.W. 6th, opened\n\nin April and serves 11 counties in northeast Kansas.\n It was founded in June 1998 on the belief that people infected with\n\nor affected by HIV/AIDS should live whole, independent and meaningful lives.\n\n\n  \" We're dealing with 'ree physical, emotional and spiritual,\" said\n\nco-founder Melba Sutton.\n \" There are some alternative ways of looking at this disease and\n\nbecoming more attuned to the spiritual.\"\n\n  Sojourn is a project of the Tides Center, a nonprofit\n\norganization that has offices in San Francisco and Washington D.C. The Tides\n\nCenter provides management and funding to about 300 projects in the United\n\nStates and internationally.\n\n  \" It 's a framework to help grass roots organizations get started\n\nup,\" Sutton said.\n\n  But Sojourn also gets funding from individual donations.\n Another source is the Ryan White Title II Care Program Case\n\nManagement funding from the AIDS section of the Kansas Department of Health\n\nand Environment 's Bureau of Epidemiology and Disease Prevention for state\n\nfiscal year 2001 starting in July.\n\n\n  \" It enables a lot of our clients to receive services they would\n\nnot typically receive,\" Sojourn co-founder, Susan Tusher said.\n\n\n  Also on staff is Elizabeth Gowdy, the evaluation, technical\n\nassistance and training expert for the organization.\n Gowdy, like Tusher and Sutton, received her master 's degree in social\n\nwork from The University of Kansas.\n All three are licensed to practice in Kansas.\n Gowdy just received her Ph.D in social work.\n All three work on a volunteer basis and there are no paid staff until\n\nJuly 1, Sutton said.\n\n  Besides taking a different approach in its service, Sojourn is\n\nalso client-driven and that is important, Tusher said.\n\n  \" The client voice is primarily why we exist.\n They all have equal say in what we do and how we do it,\" Tusher said.\n \" Our philosophy is fairly unique in social services in general.\n We're here no 'reust for the person but also as a support\n\nnetwork.\"\n\n  The group works to identify client needs.\n \" Every level of service we currently or will provide has their\n\ninput,\" Sutton said.\n\n  She said when clients come in for help, the staff sits down and\n\ndiscusses their needs - - financial, medical or spiritual assistance and\n\nemotional support - - and gives them a list of services Sojourn can\n\nprovide.\n\n  \" They are the directors for their needs,\" Sutton said.\n\n\n  And clients don't have to be infected with HIV/AIDS to get help.\n\n\n  \" It 's those people who have someone in their family infected\n\nwith HIV/AIDS,\" Sutton said.\n \" ( Family) could be defined as friend, spouse or partner.\" Tusher\n\nsaid it was anything the client defined as family.\n\n  \" I think it 's very important that it 's the infected person 's\n\ndefinition not the standard definition of what a family is,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Police arrested a Topeka man minutes after he allegedly robbed a\n\ndowntown fast-food restaurant late Saturday.\n\n  Daniel R.

{"text": "Instead of decently dying, or at least disappearing into my\n\nadoptive metaphor, I took to wandering all over the North Shore.\n Sometimes I'd walk for hours 'dn Peabody.\n\n\n  Occasionally I'd stop and look 'dry hard at the little box homes\n\nin my neighborhood, as though they contained some mystery to be explored, but\n\none day, as I was examining a little pink house on a street of identical\n\nlittle pink houses, three cop cars pulled up.\n Before I could say a word, the drivers jumped out and rousted me.\n I tried to explain that I was only trying to find signs of life, but\n\nthey handcuffed me and brought me to the station.\n Camella, of course, rescued me.\n She told them, in so many words, that I was pazz', but harmless.\n As I was sitting on the reception area bench, waiting for my release,\n\nI heard the desk sergeant say, \" You'd better keep th 'd bird in a cage, lady.\n He 's scaring the tax payers around here.\u001d\n After that unpleasant incident, I began to borrow the Cadillac, which\n\nwas unregistered.\n I supposed that if I were stopped by the police I could plead\n\ninnocent on the grounds of invincible pazziness, but, remarkably, those\n\nvigilant, fancy-town cops never spotted me.\n Day after day I would drive over to Manchester by the Sea, or\n\nMagnolia, or Ipswich, and laze on the beaches all day.\n I think the absorption of my mind into the mindless meeting of sky,\n\nsand and water did me some good.\n The regular rhythm of ocean waves pounding on the rocky shores had a\n\npowerful narcotic effect on me as I lay inert on the sand .\n Strangely, I almost never fell asleep.\n With my eyes six inches above sea level I watched sandpipers hopping\n\naround looking for food and gulls screaming their desires as they battled for\n\nscraps.\n Occasionally, a least tern would materialize before me in one of its\n\nswoops to the water.\n\n\n  Memory, desire, despair; all of them gave way to a rhythm that\n\nseemed to me an endless repetition of the same, both meaningless and\n\nreassuring. \n\n  There were plenty of young women on those beaches, but I had no\n\ninterest.\n On days when I did not relish being narcotized, I would sit on the\n\nsand and watch the surf for hours, convinced that it had a message for me.\n None came.\n After a few months, neither ecstasy nor self-hypnosis any longer\n\nsatisfied me, so I bought running shoes and ran on every shore road I could\n\nfind.\n In the golden autumn afternoons, I especially loved to be framed by\n\nthe blue ocean on one side, with its honored guests, the flocks of migrating\n\nbirds, and the riotous red, orange and yellow of the trees, as they began to\n\nlose their summer inhabitants, on the other.\n Running in the midst of this glory made me feel like a mellow fellow,\n\nbut it didn't give me the message I was seeking.\n The trees, the birds, the ocean, all spoke, it seemed to me, but\n\ntheir message was general and untranslatable into the language of\n\nintrospection.\n Almost every day I would go into the little eateries in Manchester or\n\nsome other coastal town, drink coffee, and chat with the people working\n\nbehind the counters.\n These were rich towns, but the rich were always elsewhere, it seemed.\n The coffee shops and breakfast places were largely populated by\n\nelderly people, who had lived long lives in these towns years before the\n\nyuppy boom, lived as vassals to the old money in the magnificent houses along\n\nthe coast, or as fishermen for whom the sea meant something other than it did\n\nto the owners of the many yachts moored in the harbor, or to me, for that\n\nmatter, as I dozed on the regenerative beaches.\n I especially liked Fowle 's, a funky place in Newburyport, where the\n\nold men of the town hung out.\n One side of Fowle 's was devoted to everyday items like magazines,\n\nnewspapers, cigars and supplies, the variety and number of which rivaled\n\nanything in Cambridge.\n The middle of the large, long space was lined with booths, which made\n\na sort of room divider.\n On the other side ran a long lunch and breakfast counter with pole\n\nmounted stools.\n I got in the habit of having breakfast there, mostly so that I could\n\nchat with the old men.\n It seemed to me that these old codgers knew a secret that I did not.\n They talked a lot about baseball and the weather and other concerns\n\nof the day, of course, but they were also a treasure-hoard of information\n\nabout the town and its past.\n They talked about their wives, their children, their grandchildren,\n\neven their great grandchildren.\n They had stories about their families several generations back.\n They remembered Plum Island before it got crowded, and the town\n\nitself before it underwent gentrification.\n They told me stories about friends who had drowned, spectacular sea\n\nrescues, disasters, triumphs.\n They described the harbor of sixty and more years ago.\n They remembered all the eccentric characters on both land and sea.\n Some even remembered how they met their wives.\n A few cried unashamedly at the memory of lost loved ones.\n Most of them were lonely, and had little more than their memories to\n\ncomfort them.\n Even though, at their age, memory usually meant recollections of\n\nloss, they made of it a kind of presence, reassurance that they belonged\n\nsomewhere in the world.\n\n\n  I made a good friend of one denizen of Fowle 's, or, more\n\naccurately, he adopted me.\n His name was Sam Amaro.\n Sam had owned a fishing boat for a while and had fished the local\n\nwaters for more than fifty years before a heart problem and a bad back forced\n\nhim into retirement.\n He had lost his parents to influenza after the Great War, when he was\n\nten years old, and his brother eight.\n Much of his childhood had been spent in orphanages and foster homes.\n One of his foster parents happened to be a fisherman.\n When Sam was fourteen, the fisherman took him out on an expedition.\n From that time on, Sam was a fisherman.\n He remained close to his brother all those years, even though they\n\nspent most of that time in different foster homes.\n When Sam turned eighteen, he applied for guardianship of his brother.\n In those days, before the rise of social workers, nobody much cared\n\nto inquire into the details.\n If a relative signed for a child, the judge let him go.\n Sam told me that his joy at having his brother with him was like\n\nnothing he had ever experienced, and since has been matched only by the birth\n\nof his two children.\n When Sam married Maria Albiani, a Gloucester fisherman 's daughter, in\n\n1931, - - he said that was joy, too, but of a different kind - - his brother\n\ncontinued to live with him.\n Apparently, they were very happy.\n Sam and his brother, whose name was Antonio, like my father 's, worked\n\nvery hard to save money for a boat, a task made more difficult by the birth\n\nof Sam 's son and daughter.\n Tony had decided, said Sam, to forsake looking for a wife until Sam 's\n\nfamily was a little more financially secure, so he stayed resident in a tiny\n\nroom off the back hallway of the ramshackle apartment they had rented.\n In 1935, the brothers bought their dreamboat.\n They christened it with an elaborate name: Santa Maria della Buona\n\nFortuna. \n\n  A token of their desire to express, through Maria 's namesake,\n\ntheir joy in the present and, in their evocation of the goddess, their hope\n\nfor the future.\n Life went along very smoothly for a few years.\n Tony had fallen in love, and, now that the brothers were solvent, had\n\ndecide to get married.\n Much to everyone 's satisfaction, he found a place to rent only a\n\nblock away.\n The wedding took place on the boat.\n Then, one night in 1938, Tony, with a small crew, was returning from\n\nan unusually long fishing trip.\n Sam had stayed in Gloucester to help tend his son, who had contracted\n\nscarlet fever.\n About twelve hours from Gloucester , the hurricane hit the Santa\n\nMaria della Buona Fortuna.\n The coastguard later reported that they had received a distress\n\nsignal from the vessel, but that the message had been cut off before they\n\ncould fix its position.\n The family barely survived that disaster, which crippled them both\n\neconomically and emotionally.\n Tony 's wife moved in with Sam and Maria.\n Both women took jobs in fish packing plants, Maria at night, Tony 's\n\nwife during the day.\n They shared care of the children.\n Sam barely survived.\n\n\n  Sam had to go back to working on another man 's boat.\n The pay was poor, because the smaller boats were losing out to the\n\nbig trawlers that came out of Boston.\n Somehow, and Sam, looking back on it, professes not to know how, the\n\nthree adults managed to feed and clothe the children, and send them to\n\nschool.\n Both children were good students and both won college scholarships.\n The daughter, Maria, went to Smith, where she studied literature.\n She now teaches at Berkeley.\n Tony, the son, went to Boston College.\n He was interested in the law.\n While there, he joined the R.\n O.\n T.\n C., to help defray costs that his scholarship didn't cover.\n In 1952 he graduated summa cum laude.\n Three months later, on a muddy hill half way across the world, a rain\n\nof artillery shells exploded in the midst of his platoon, killing him and\n\nmost of the men he was leading.\n Oddly enough, according to Sam, he was not destroyed by the news.\n By that time he had learned to expect such things from life.\n When his wife died of cancer, in 1988, Sam did not cry.\n He had cried too much during the long months of her suffering, he\n\nsaid.\n Now, he looked forward to the times when he could see his daughter\n\nand her children, although he was not yet ready to move out to \" cuckoo\n\nland,\" as he put it.\n He had too many memories along the streets and shores of\n\nMassachusetts to give them up just yet.\n This was the man who befriended me at the counter of Fowle 's\n\neverything store in Newburyport. \n\n  Many days we would walk the beaches together.\n Sam never said much on these walks, except to comment on the clams,\n\nor plants, or salt-water marshes, as we went along.\n He knew everything about them, it seemed.\n Once, he took me clamming.\n He had borrowed a pair of hip boots from a friend for me, but they\n\nwere much too big.\n We hadn't sloshed out into the mud flats very far, when I got stuck.\n The green-black ooze caught hold of me and sucked me in high over my\n\nknees.\n The more I struggled, the more I sank.\n Sam, standing safely away from the carnivorous mud, was enjoying the\n\nspectacle mightily.\n Finally, after he had had enough entertainment, he threw me a line\n\nfrom a boat beached nearby.\n I grabbed it and began pulling with all my strength.\n As I pulled, my too big boots remained in the muck, and, when my\n\nfeet finally got free of them, the force of my pulling twisted me around my\n\nclamming pail and caused me to go sprawling face first in the stinking stuff\n\nthat formed the world 's most complex ecosystem.\n All around me, I could see jets of water sent up by indignant\n\nbivalves.\n Sam, standing at some distance, called out to me, \" That 's a way,\n\nson.\n You shua found them clams.\n Now all you gotta do is dig ` em up.?\n Once out of the boots, I managed to pull myself to safety.\n I was painted green black and smelled like low tide at the point\n\nwhere salt water marsh meets the ocean.\n For those who have smelled that smell, no explanation is necessary;\n\nfor others, no description is adequate.\n Against the ribbing

{"text": "ONE THING just led to another, Mike Neely says when asked to\n\nexplain why he spent two years living on the streets of downtown Los Angeles.\n A Marine with 13 months of Vietnam combat experience behind him, Neely\n\nreturned home bringing with him a problem with drugs and alcohol.\n \" I lost my family and my job,\" Neely relates.\n \" I ended up sleeping in a park near City Hall.\"\n Then there 's Ralph C., a 57-year-old Navy veteran who served in the\n\nPhilippines and Japan during the Korean War.\n Ask Ralph how he became homeless 30 years ago and he says: \" The first\n\ntwo or three days you think it will be temporary.\n It becomes a couple of weeks, a couple of months, then years and you\n\nare there,\" he shrugs.\n Can't he work?\n\n\n  He refuses welfare and won't panhandle as a matter of pride, so\n\nhe makes do for himself and his two dogs by handling odd jobs for the\n\nmerchants near the midtown Los Angeles parking lot he calls home.\n\n  Across the nation, there are many more Mikes and Ralphs who live\n\nin big cities.\n Los Angeles, by most reckonings, has the nation 's largest homeless\n\npopulation, but New York isn't far behind, and Chicago, Boston and the others\n\nall claim their share.\n Small cities and towns also have their homeless and if you look hard\n\nenough, \" you'll find thousands of homeless 'll in the bushes\" of rural\n\nAmerica,\" says Neely, who ended his own homelessness five years ago and now\n\nis executive director of the Homeless Outreach Project ( HOP) in Los\n\nAngeles.\n\n  There are so many homeless that the streets of America last year\n\nclaimed more lives of veterans than Desert Storm combat did.\n \" In Boston alone, 16 homeless veterans froze to death last winter,\"\n\nsays Ken Smith, a former Army medic in Vietnam who is executive director of\n\nthe New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans.\n \" Nationwide, maybe 1,000 veterans died homeless, cold and alone.\n\n\n\n  Just how big is the problem?\n Guesses range from the Urban Institute 's 1988 estimate of 500,000 to\n\n600,000 homeless all the way up to 3 million.\n\n  When Census Bureau enumerators fanned out across the nation one\n\nnight last March to count the homeless, many hoped this would end the\n\nmystery.\n It didn't.\n The Census Bureau found only 228,261 homeless, but experts scorn that\n\ntally.\n New York 's Doe Foundation, for instance, claimed that in one\n\n116-block area of Manhattan, Census Bureau enumerators counted 378 homeless,\n\nbut Doe 's count was 1,649.\n In the end, the Census Bureau 's Cynthia Tauber conceded, \" We will\n\nnever have a total homeless count.\"\n\n  James G., a 40-year-old Vietnam veteran who 's been homeless for\n\nfour years agreed.\n The New York\n\nTimes  .\n He added the Census Bureau was not committed to counting homeless.\n \" If they were, they would know how many people out here need\n\nhelp.\"\n\n\n  \" The public 's perception of who the homeless are is distorted.\n They are not one type of person,\" says Elizabeth Bailey of Los\n\nAngeles' Weingart Center, an agency that provides 600 beds for the\n\nhomeless.\n\n  In that vein, while surveys designed to accurately define the\n\nhomeless population have been numerous, none has proved any more conclusive\n\nthan the attempts to count them.\n It 's because many homeless people don't want anyone to know much\n\nabout them.\n Perhaps that is why some experts insists that 25 percent of the\n\nhomeless are women with children, while others claim there are very few\n\nhomeless families.\n\n  But one group about which there 's little debate is veterans.\n How many of the homeless are veterans? Around one-third, says VA.\n Independent groups arrive at about the same number.\n For example, veterans accounted for 31 percent of the homeless in a\n\n1989 UCLA survey, while at Step Up On Second, a Santa Monica, Calif., service\n\nagency, a month-by-month client tally for 1991 's first quarter found that 33\n\npercent were veterans.\n\n\n  Ten years ago, when homelessness first surfaced in the media,\n\nmany claimed that the cause and cure was housing.\n No longer.\n \" The days of thinking there is one solution to homelessness--just\n\nproviding housing--are gone,\" says Andrew Cuomo, who runs New York 's Housing\n\nEnterprise for the Less Privileged.\n Lack of low-cost housing, particularly in Cities, is a factor.\n In Los Angeles, for instance, half of downtown 's single room\n\noccupancy units were demolished in urban renewal campaigns between 1970 and\n\n1985.\n But according to shelter director Smith, \" There is no one cause of\n\nhomelessness.\"\n\n  Al Peck, administrator of the 600-bed Borden Avenue Veterans\n\nResidence in Queens, N.Y, agrees.\n \" The assumption used to be that the homeless were people who had\n\nsuffered a streak of bad luck, losing their jobs and homes, and if they were\n\ngiven a place to stay, that alone would solve their problems.\n\n\n  Just what are the causes? Experts single out a handful of chief\n\nreasons:\n\n  - Deinstitutionalization of psychiatric wards is a primary factor\n\nsays Smith.\n Starting in the l960s and continuing to today, stale mental\n\nhospitals, pressured by both civil libertarians and budget cutters, have\n\nemptied their beds.\n In 1955, those hospitals had 552,000 patients; today 's number is\n\n119,000.\n Unfortunately, many have wound up on the streets.\n According to research conducted by Johns Hopkins Medical School, 40\n\npercent of homeless men and about half the women suffer from mental\n\ndisorders.\n Experts haggle over exactly how disturbed the homeless are, but\n\nSmith 's street-eye-view is that \" at minimum, 15 percent of the guys we see\n\nare pretty far gone.\n\n\n  - Substance abuse is another crucial factor, according to a\n\nrecent 22-city survey by the U.S.\n Conference of Mayors, which estimates that 44 percent of the homeless\n\nare substance abusers.\n Peck says, \" Over two-thirds of the men are here because of alcohol\n\nor drug problems, or both.\"\n\n  HOP 's Neely provides a personal case in point: 'My homelessness\n\nwas directly related to drugs.\n Before I went to 'Nam I knew nothing about drugs.\n Over there I experienced fear for the first time in my life and I\n\ntried to counter it through drugs.\n\n\n  - \" Bad papers\" or other than honorable discharges from military\n\nservice are another factor in homelessness, according to both Smith and Peck,\n\nwho open their shelter doors to all who served regardless of discharge\n\nstatus.\n\n  \" A man comes in here with bad paper, maybe for smoking pot in\n\nVietnam, and he 's been living in shame since.\n It 's a chicken bone that 's been caught in his throat for years,\" says\n\nSmith, who 's been honored as one of President Bush 's \" thousand points of\n\nlight.\"\n\n\n  Helping the homeless is not an easy mission.\n Brother Denys Cormier, founder of the Catholic order Emmaus in\n\nHartford, Conn., tells why.\n \" In the Scriptures, Christ raised people from the dead.\n We don't have people in the Scriptures who refused to be raised from\n\nthe dead.\n\n\n  Pessimisin, in fact, is widespread.\n A 1990 poll by the Marist Institute of Public Opinion found that 76\n\npercent of Americans think that the homelessness problem will remain as big\n\nas it currently is .\n .\n .\n or increase.\n Even so, there are optimists and Al Peek is one of them, but not at\n\nthe loss of realism.\n \" The homeless look at life in the short-term.\n Where will I get my next meal?\n Where will I sleep? Many helping programs are short-term themselves.\n They offer just a meal or maybe three days or a week of shelter.\n If you're homele 're you're not go 're to get back into society that\n\nfast,\" Peck says.\n\n  He says the homeless have burned all their bridges.\n The only way to get them hack into the mainstream is with a\n\ncomprehensive, bridge-building campaign.\n\n  Peck 's numbers back him up.\n In the four years his Borden Avenue Veterans Residence has been open,\n\n6,000 homeless veterans have come through the doors and \" we successfully put\n\n20 percent back into jobs and housing.\"\n Peck 's program takes, on average, 18 months to complete but\n\napparently delivers a lasting cure.\n \" They've finally 'vee it out of their hopelessness and want to get\n\non with their lives,\" he says.\n\n  Ken Smith 's New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans boasts\n\nsimilar successes.\n In its first year of operation it returned 650 men to jobs or housing\n\nor both, says Smith.\n\n  Why are these programs working while many others aren't?\n \" We don't baby people,\" says Smith, who models his 125-bed operation\n\nafter Army boot camp.\n \" We don't warehouse veterans, which is what so many programs do with\n\nthe homeless.\n Our job is to get them tough and get them out.\n We force sobriety on them and, then, we reinstill the brotherhood and\n\ncamaraderie every man felt in the service.\"\n\n  Smith says that the last time many of the veterans felt personal\n\npride was in the military.\n \" We remind them of that.\n We get the man standing tall again, building on his renewed\n\nself-respect.\"\n\n  Much the same philosophy prevails at Peck 's shelter, \" If you\n\ndon't want to give up drugs and alcohol, this isn't where you belong, \" Peck\n\ntells newcomers.\n \" We demand that you want to end your homelessness.\n Meet just that entry requirement and you're in 'rend you're pr 'reded\n\nwith a personalized contract.\"\n\n  Peck says the contract tells the veterans what they cannot\n\ndo--no fighting, no drugs, etc., and what they must do, from participating in\n\nsubstance abuse counseling through job training.\n\n\n  Smith is convinced his shelter can save enough homelss veterans\n\nand get them working again so their taxes will support the programs that\n\nhelped them.\n\n  \" But, you know what keeps me here?\" Smith says.\n \" I've had 'ven say to me.\n 'I'd be 'd drunk 20 years.\n Now I'm sob 'm.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Falling families, easy drugs and glamorous violence push\n\ntwo-million kids to crime.\n\n\n  REMEMBER juvenile delinquency when you were growing up?\n The bad kids smoked in school bathrooms, shoplifted candy bars,\n\nstole hubcaps and took hot- wired cars on joy-rides.\n The really tough teenagers fought with knives, chains and brass\n\nknuckles.\n \" These young hoodlums,\" said adults, \" are about as bad as kids can\n\nget.\"\n\n  Guess again.\n By almost any standard, juvenile delinquents in the 1990s are much\n\nworse.\n \" Today 's young criminals have more dangerous drugs in their bodies,\n\nmore dangerous weapons in their hands, and a more casual attitude about human\n\nlife than ever before,\" says James Fox, professor of criminal justice at\n\nNortheastern University.\n \" We're 'reeing a new crime wave in which juvenile offenders are\n\nextremely violent and homicidal.\"\n\n  In a single generation, juvenile crime has grown from a petty\n\nirritation into what many people perceive to be a national menace.\n\n\nWest Side Story  - - has become a real-life horror drama.\n\n  After stabilizing and even declining a bit in the early 1980s,\n\nthe juvenile crime rate is again on the rise.\n Juveniles now account for about a third of all serious crime such as\n\nmurder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, arson and auto\n\ntheft.\n\n  Nearly 2 million children under the age of 18 are arrested each\n\nyear.\n Teenage arrests for rape and assault are up 15 percent and 19\n\npercent respectively, and the number of juveniles committing murder has\n\ndoubled in the last five years.\n Teen-age boys--often the victims of their peers--are now more likely\n\nto die from gunshot wounds than from all natural causes combined.\n\n  IN 1989, a national poll indicated that nearly nine of every 10\n\nAmericans believed the problem of teen-age violence had gotten worse in\n\nrecent years.\n\n \n\n  - A 15-year-old New Hampshire youth--at the urging of his\n\nteacher-lover-- murders the woman 's husband in cold blood.\n\n  - Two teen-age boys in California take turns blasting three\n\nfemale friends with a shotgun.\n The boys told police the massacre started with an argument, but they\n\ncouldn't remember what it was about.\n\n \n\n  - A roving band of boys beat, rape and leave a female jogger for\n\ndead in New York 's Central Park.\n There 's even a new word to describe this kind of crime, \" wilding,\"\n\nthe wanton, unprovoked, random attack on people and property.\n In some inner cities, \" wilding\" has become a form of\n\nrecreation.\n\n  Increasingly, schools are becoming crime scenes.\n Where once gum chewing and talking in class were major problems,\n\nchildren now regularly shoot, maim and steal from each other and from their\n\nteachers.\n More than 47,000 teachers and 2.5 million high school students have\n\nbecome crime victims at school, and some inner-city schools now have metal\n\ndetectors and conduct \" bullet drills\" along with fire drills.\n\n  \" Crime has started to affect the way schools operate,\" says\n\nGary Bauer, former U.S.\n Undersecretary of Education.\n \" Frequently, the schools that fail to teach kids the skills they\n\nneed are the schools most riddled with crime.\"", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ad92e4cc-ad7e-4ab2-8330-e13fc7ba9f2a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.724889+00:00"}
{"text": "Friday evening, the day the Hill-Thomas hearings began, a friend\n\ncalled and said she wasn't sure why she was so fascinated by the proceedings.\n I said it might be because we almost never see more than a glimpse of\n\na real black woman on TV talking about anything, let alone the painful\n\nrealities of racial-sexual politics.\n Both of us found it compelling, simply to watch Anita Hill-bright,\n\nsincere, black, and female.\n Here was someone we recognized.\n\n\n  I can think of no other situation that has commanded the nation 's\n\nundivided attention that so clearly illustrated the inextricable links\n\nbetween racism and sexism.\n It 's difficult to conceive how the hearings could be understood from\n\nanything other than a black feminist perspective.\n A perspective that doesn't require shortchanging any aspect of black\n\nwomen 's reality or assume racial oppression is more important than sexual\n\noppression or vice versa.\n\n  But of course this was not the way Anita Hill 's description of\n\nsexual harassment was responded to, which explains in part why this drama\n\nended as it did.\n\n  As a black feminist, I've long believed 'vet political analyses\n\nand strategies that take into account how racism, sexism, homophobia, and\n\nclass oppression dovetail and interlock, provide the clearest and most\n\nrevolutionary agendas for change.\n Unfortunately, the outcome seemingly illustrates that my perspective\n\nand that of most women of color simply doesn't count, because ultimately it 's\n\nthe white male ruling class that gets to define reality and call the\n\nshots.\n\n  Yes, I was furious at how Anita Hill was treated, but as a black\n\nfeminist, a socialist, and a lesbian, I was not particularly surprised.\n I don't expect justice from the Republicans or the Democrats, whose\n\nduplicity and ineffectualness were revealed in bas-relief during the\n\nhearings.\n I also don't agree with the mainstream women 's movement 's singular\n\nsolution to run as many women for office as possible.\n Late twentieth-century U.S.\n capitalism cannot be fixed by adding new faces to the ruling\n\nclass.\n\n  The worst consequence of the Hill-Thomas hearings for me was in\n\nwhat they revealed about African Americans' level of consciousness regarding\n\nboth sexual and racial politics.\n It has always taken courage for women of color to speak out about\n\nsexism within our communities.\n In this instance it was done more publicly and dramatically than at\n\nany time in history.\n For that, Hill was attacked not only by white right-wing misogynists,\n\nbut by African Americans who felt that she had stepped out of line by\n\naccusing a black man chosen by white racists for high office.\n\n  It was demoralizing to see how the confrontation reinforced the\n\nperception that any woman who raises the issue of sexual oppression in the\n\nblack community is somehow a traitor to the race, which translates into being\n\na traitor to black men.\n It is particularly disheartening knowing that probably a lot of black\n\npeople took this stance despite believing Anita Hill.\n They who decided that standing behind a black man--even one with\n\nutter contempt for the struggles of African Americans--is more important than\n\nsupporting a black woman 's right not to be abused.\n\n  But the attitudes brought to the surface by the Hill- Thomas\n\nconfrontation are not unique.\n As in the heyday of the 1965 Moynihan Report, black women are again\n\nseen as the cause of the myriad problems our people face.\n Despite the fact that we experience sexual as well as racial and\n\nclass oppression, black women are thought to be in a much better position\n\nthan endangered black men.\n Blaming black women instead of capitalism, racism, and those who run\n\nthe system is a political dead end.\n And yet negative views of black women abound.\n Recent films by black men ridicule us, scapegoat us for all of the\n\nrace 's problems, and portray violence against us as perfectly justifiable.\n Rap music almost always defines black women as shrews, with no value\n\nother than as sexual commodities.\n Black male teenagers in many cities are wearing T-shirts with the\n\nwords SHUT UP BITCH written in bold letters.\n\n  This increasing misogyny and those polls indicating that most\n\nblack Americans supported Thomas, tell me how much work black feminists still\n\nhave to do.\n We must alert our communities to issues of sexual violence and get\n\nout the message that respecting black women 's freedom does not subtract from\n\nthe freedom of black men.\n\n  Yes, the Hill-Thomas confrontation was incredibly depressing, but\n\nit was also politically catalytic.\n It illustrated why the work of activist feminists of color is so\n\ncrucial, why we must continue to build a movement whose politics have the\n\nrevolutionary potential to free us all.\n It also helped to radicalize more women.\n ( One of them, I hope, is Anita Hill.)\n I see numerous signs.\n African American Women in Defense of Ourselves is a grassroots\n\nnetwork that sprang up within days of the hearings and placed ads in the New\n\nYork  Times  ( November 17, 1991) and in African American newspapers\n\nall over the country.\n Their clear analysis of the hearings, signed by 1,603 black women,\n\nmarks a watershed in black feminist organizing.\n Never have so many black women publicly stated their refusal to pit\n\nracial oppression against sexual oppression.\n The ad has elicited an outpouring of support, and the enthusiastic\n\nsigners intend to create an ongoing mechanism for organizing and speaking\n\nout.\n\n  Revolutionary Sisters of Color is a socialist-feminist\n\norganization that is building a political base both nationally and\n\ninternationally.\n Founded in 1990, this is the first autonomous group embracing all\n\nwomen of color in this country and abroad committed to an explicitly\n\nsocialist and feminist agenda that confronts the capitalist basis for racial,\n\nsexual, and homophobic oppression.\n\n  I find it encouraging that some black men were furious about what\n\nhappened to Anita Hill and had the integrity to speak out.\n Many more need to do so.\n\n\n  I hope that white feminists have a better sense of the challenges\n\nwomen of color face when we make the commitment to confront sexual\n\noppression.\n Those who really want to support our struggle can best do so by\n\ncleaning the racism out of their own houses.\n This can only be accomplished by participating in political\n\norganizing that directly challenges the multiple oppressions women of color\n\nface, oppressions that undermine  their  lives as well.\n Not only would we then have more trustworthy allies, but it would\n\nalso be that much harder to accuse us of being the dupes of unprincipled\n\nwhite women.\n\n  Although Thomas' confirmation seemingly demonstrated the\n\noverarching power of the white male ruling class, I got a different message.\n The powers that be are in serious trouble.\n This was only the latest example of their efforts to maintain their\n\nhold upon the failing capitalist economy and upon an image of power by using\n\ndesperate means, by resorting to ever more outrageous lies and deceptions\n\njust to stay in place.\n\n  Yes, it 's going to be a long struggle.\n But in the after-math of the Hill-Thomas episode, my new T-shirt will\n\ndisplay the words of the old freedom song, AIN'T GONNA LET NOBODY TURN ME\n\nAROUND! \n\n\n\n\n  I am not one of the people who sat transfixed before the\n\ntelevision, watching the Senate hearings.\n I had classes to go to, papers to write, and frankly, the whole thing\n\nwas too painful.\n A black man grilled by a panel of white men about his sexual\n\ndeviance.\n A black woman claiming harassment and being discredited by other\n\nwomen....\n I could not bring myself to watch that sensationalized assault of the\n\nhuman spirit.\n\n  To me, the hearings were not about determining whether or not\n\nClarence Thomas did in fact harass Anita Hill.\n They were about checking and redefining the extent of women 's\n\ncredibility and power.\n\n  Can a woman 's experience undermine a man 's career?\n Can a woman 's voice, a woman 's sense of self-worth and injustice,\n\nchallenge a structure predicated upon the subjugation of our gender?\n Anita Hill 's testimony threatened to do that and more.\n If Thomas had not been confirmed, every man in the United States\n\nwould be at risk.\n For how many senators never told a sexist joke?\n How many men have not used their protected male privilege to thwart\n\nin some way the influence or ideas of a woman colleague, friend, or\n\nrelative?\n\n  For those whose sense of power is so obviously connected to the\n\nhealth and vigor of the penis, it would have been a metaphoric castration.\n\n\n  While some may laud the whole spectacle for the consciousness it\n\nraised around sexual harassment, its very real outcome is more informative.\n He was promoted.\n She was repudiated.\n Men were assured of the inviolability of their penis/power.\n\n\n  The backlash against U.S.\n women is real.\n As the misconception of equality between the sexes becomes more\n\nubiquitous, so does the attempt to restrict the boundaries of women 's\n\npersonal and political power.\n Thomas' confirmation, the ultimate rally of support for the male\n\nparadigm of harassment, sends a clear message to women: \" Shut up!\n\n\n \n\n  I acknowledge the fact that we live under siege.\n I in- tend to fight back.\n I have uncovered and unleashed more repressed anger than I thought\n\npossible.\n For the umpteenth time in my 22 years, I have been radicalized,\n\npoliticized, shaken awake.\n I have come to voice again, and this time my voice is not\n\nconciliatory.\n\n  The night after Thomas' confirmation I ask the man I am intimate\n\nwith what he thinks of the whole mess.\n His concern is primarily with Thomas' propensity to demolish civil\n\nrights and opportunities for people of color.\n I launch into a tirade.\n \" When will progressive black men prioritize my rights and\n\nwell-being?\n When will they stop talking so damn much about 'the race' as if it\n\nrevolved exclusively around them?\"\n He tells me I wear my emotions on my sleeve.\n I scream \" I need to know, are you with me or are you going to help\n\nthem try to destroy me?\"\n\n  A week later I am on a train to New York.\n A beautiful mother and daughter, both wearing green outfits, sit\n\nacross the aisle from me.\n The little girl has tightly plaited braids.\n Her brown skin is glowing and smooth, her eyes bright as she chatters\n\nhappily while looking out the window.\n Two men get on the train and sit directly behind me, shaking my seat\n\nas they thud into place.\n .\n Loudly they begin to talk about women.\n \" Man, I fucked that bitch all night and then I never called her\n\nagain.\" \" Man, there 's lots of girlies over there, you know that ho, live\n\nover there by Tyrone?\n\n\n  The mother moves closer to her now quiet daughter.\n Looking at her small back I can see that she is listening to the\n\nmen.\n I am thinking of how I can transform the situation, of all the\n\npeople in the car whose silence makes us complicit.\n\n  Another large man gets on the train.\n After exchanging loud greetings with the two men, he sits next to\n\nme.\n He tells them he is going to Philadelphia to visit his wife and\n\nchild.\n I am suckered into thinking that he is different.\n Then, \" Man, there 's a ton of females in Philly, just waitin' for\n\nyou to give 'em some.\" I turn my head and allow the fire in my eyes to\n\nburn into him.\n He takes up two seats and has hands with huge swollen knuckles.\n I imagine the gold rings on his fingers slamming into my face.\n He senses something, \" What 's your name, sweetheart?\"\n\n\n  A torrent explodes: \" I ain't your sweetheart, I ain't your\n\nbitch, I ain't your baby.\n How dare you have the nerve to sit up here and talk about women that\n\nway, and then try to speak to me.\"\n The woman/mother chimes in to the beat with claps of sisterhood.\n The men are momentarily stunned.\n Then the comeback: \" Aw, bitch, don't play that woman shit over here 'cause\n\nthat 's bullshit.\"\n He slaps the back of one hand against the palm of the other.\n I refuse to back down.\n\n\n  My instinct kicks in, telling me to get out.\n \" Since I see you all are not going to move, I will.\"\n I move to the first car.\n I am so angry that thoughts of murder, of physically retaliating\n\nagainst them, of separatism, engulf me.\n I am almost out of body, just shy of being pure force.\n I am sick of the way women are negated, violated, devalued, ignored.\n I am livid, unrelenting in my anger at those who invade my space,\n\nwho wish to take away my rights, who refuse to hear my voice.\n\n  As the days pass, I push myself to figure out what it means to\n\nbe a part of the Third Wave of feminism.\n I begin to realize that I owe it to myself, to my little sister on\n\nthe train, to all of the daughters yet to be born, to push beyond my rage and\n\narticulate an agenda.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "APPLIED LINGUISTICS C204: LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT TAKE-HOME EXAM\n#1\n\n\n In this question, students in an adult education program in a large U.S.\n\ncity are given an exit test to provide evidence of their ability to\n\nparticipate in small talk.\n The limitations on measurement, including underspecification,\n\nindirectness, incompleteness, imprecision, subjectivity, and relativeness,\n\nall apply to the specific features of this testing situation.\n These limitations, in addition to some other factors, affect\n\ninterpretations of test scores, reliability, and construct validity.\n However, these limitations can be minimized through the steps in\n\nassessment, defining the construct theoretically and operationally and\n\ndescribing observations of performance.\n\n Underspecification, the process of making \" certain simplifying\n\nassumptions\", applies to this testing situation ( Bachman, p. 31).\n Though the intention is to measure a construct that includes knowledge\n\nof vocabulary, knowledge of syntax, and textual knowledge, the examiners\n\ncannot assume that the different parts of the test only measure those\n\ncomponents of language.\n For example, in the textual organization ability test, a student may\n\nnot perform well because he does not have the vocabulary to express himself.\n This may affect his ability to organize his thoughts in a meaningful\n\nway and will in the end negatively affect his score on this portion of the\n\ntest.\n This then would have an effect on validity of the score\n\ninterpretation, as it would be difficult to know what the score is actually\n\nmeasuring.\n Even if there are other factors that affect a student 's performance,\n\nwe must isolate the factors we wish to measure through underspecification.\n In the end, this may affect our ability to interpret scores in a\n\nvalid way.\n\n This testing situation is designed to measure a student 's ability to\n\nengage in small talk.\n Since it is designed to be an oral interview, it may seem to be a \"\n\ndirect test\" because it \" involve(s) the use of the skills being tested\" (\n\nBachman, p. 33).\n However, this language test, like all language tests, is indirect\n\nbecause its score is not based on an actual \" small talk\" conversation that\n\nthe student had with someone outside of the testing situation.\n Since the scores are \" indirect indicators of ability\", it is very\n\nimportant to specify the relationship between the test score and the ability\n\nit should indicate.\n If this is unclear, the interpretations and uses could be\n\ninvalid.\n\n As with any language testing situation, the performance observed and\n\nmeasured in a language test is \" a sample of an individual 's total\n\nperformance in that language\" ( Bachman, p. 33).\n This test is designed to sample a student 's performance in order to\n\nmeasure his competence in a broad TLU domain, which includes \" a variety of\n\ntypes of tasks to meet occupational, day-to-day pragmatic, and social needs\".\n However, since the student has the opportunity to choose a topic\n\nabout which to speak during the entire test, the score will be based on an\n\nincomplete sample of performance.\n The score will only reflect the components of the construct as they\n\nrelate to the student 's chosen area of expertise.\n This will affect the construct validity, as it will be difficult to\n\nassess whether the score interpretations are appropriate or meaningful in\n\nrelation to the student 's ability to engage in small talk about a variety of\n\ndifferent topics.\n This could also affect reliability, since if the student had happened\n\nto choose a different topic with which he is comfortable he may have received\n\na different score.\n\n Imprecision poses two problems in this testing situation.\n As Bachman states, \" the accuracy or precision of our measurements is\n\na function of both the representativeness and the number of tasks or units\n\nwith which we define our scales ( Bachman, p. 35).\n In order to increase precision of measurements, it is necessary to\n\ndevelop a rating scale that includes as many levels as possible.\n In this case, the scale that is being used is not described in any\n\ndetail.\n In addition, comparability of the tasks on the test, \" in terms of\n\ntheir difficulty relative to the ability of the test takers\", is important.\n Because this test is designed for beginning to advanced students with\n\nexpertise in different areas, it would be quite difficult to assure\n\ncomparability for all the students taking the test.\n This imprecision will make it difficult to interpret scores\n\nappropriately, as the level of difficulty of the test questions would affect\n\ndifferent students' performance in different ways.\n\n\n This language test, like all language tests, is subjective.\n The design of the test is subjective, for the choice of which\n\nquestions to ask and which topics the test takers can choose from are\n\nsubjective.\n In addition, the way that the two examiners score these tests is\n\ndefinitely subjective.\n Though they have a rating scale to guide their scoring, the examiners\n\neach have their own perspectives and ideas about the test taker 's abilities.\n Also, if the examiners disagree about scores, they \" discuss the\n\ninterview and their notes in order to arrive at a rating that they can agree\n\nupon\".\n This process could result in scores that may or may not be reliable,\n\nsince the scores depend to some extent upon the raters.\n Also, if the test were given to the same student more than once,\n\nfinal scoring decisions could change if different raters were placed together\n\nor if the same raters switched jobs; this would also affect the reliability\n\nof the scores.\n Lastly, the test taker is consistently making subjective decisions\n\nduring the test about the types of answers that he wants to give.\n\n It is difficult to define the presence or absence of the components of\n\nthe construct; in this way, this testing situation is relative.\n For example, though there is a section in this test which includes \"\n\nSpecialized Vocabulary Questions\", it would be impossible to define a\n\nstudent 's ability based on a concept of \" zero language ability\" as related\n\nto vocabulary ( Bachman, p. 38).\n In addition, the construct includes knowledge of a range of syntactic\n\nstructures.\n It would be difficult to say that a test taker has \" perfect language\n\nability\" or a \" native speaker 's ability\" in syntax.\n This limits the examiners' ability to measure these components.\n In turn, this limitation affects their ability to interpret the\n\nscores in a clear, useful, and meaningful way.\n\n Many of these factors affect reliability.\n There are also other issues unique to this testing situation which\n\naffect reliability.\n For example, the results of this test will be used for two different\n\npurposes, one that is low-stakes and the other that is high-stakes.\n This makes it difficult to assess how reliable the scores need to be.\n In addition, the fact that there is scoring done during the test will\n\naffect the reliability of the scores.\n The test taker could be affected by being scored while the test is\n\nhappening, which will affect his \" affective schemata\".\n The test taker 's \" affective schemata\" will therefore not be the same\n\nas that of the language user, as discussed in Bachman and Palmer ( Bachman\n\nand Palmer, p. 20).\n In this way, the testing situation itself is affecting the test\n\ntaker 's performance, which can in turn affect the reliability of the\n\nscores.\n\n These six limitations in measurement greatly affect interpretations of\n\ntest scores, reliability, and construct validity.\n Also, one other point is that we would want to make sure that the \"\n\nareas of expertise\" that the test takers can choose to talk about are\n\nactually topics within the TLU domain of \" small talk\".\n If not, the results of the entire test could be interpreted in an\n\ninvalid way for the intended purpose. \n\n\n The situation that is described here has very specific qualities.\n These qualities would affect the choices I would make when developing\n\nthe language test, interpreting the test scores, and determining the scores\n\nfor making placements into the different levels.\n In this case, I would use a criterion-referenced achievement test to\n\nplace the beginning to advanced individuals into different course levels for\n\na variety of reasons.\n\n Criterion-referenced tests are intended to enable \" the test user to\n\ninterpret a test score with reference to a criterion level of ability or\n\ndomain of content\" ( Bachman, p. 74).\n The test tasks are, therefore, representative of such levels or\n\ndomains.\n As Brown discusses, in an achievement test, the developer bases test\n\nitems on \" objectives of whole range of course levels\" ( handout).\n In this situation, there are \" fixed syllabi and textbooks for each\n\nlevel, and the teachers are expected to follow the textbooks closely\".\n Therefore, it would be necessary for the placement test tasks to be\n\nbased closely on the content of the different course syllabi and textbooks.\n For example, I would include questions that test different levels of\n\ncompetence regarding vocabulary, verb tenses, grammar points, and syntax as\n\nthey are presented in the different levels' course syllabi and textbooks (\n\nthrough listening, speaking, and written exercises).\n In this way, a criterion-referenced achievement test would be\n\nappropriate.\n In this situation, there is \" the potential for more appropriate\n\nplacements, with respect to course content objectives\" ( handout).\n\n A criterion-referenced achievement test is also appropriate in this case\n\nbecause the teachers have no formal training and little previous experience,\n\nin addition to the fact there is a large turn-over in teaching staff each\n\nterm.\n Since the test tasks will be chosen with the syllabi and textbooks\n\nfor each level in mind, it is possible for the teachers to gain diagnostic\n\ninformation about course objectives based on the results of the tests.\n Brown mentions another advantage of CR achievement tests, which is\n\nthat one only needs to develop \" a single test battery for placement,\n\nprogress, and grading decisions\" ( handout).\n This would also help the inexperienced teachers, since they could use\n\nthe same tests before, during, and after the term to determine information\n\nabout the students' progress.\n\n The two disadvantages generally associated with CR achievement tests do\n\nnot apply in this testing situation.\n The first, which is that \" if cohorts vary in proficiency or size\n\nfrom year to year, there will be shifts in the numbers of students in various\n\ncourse levels, but placements will still be appropriate\" ( handout).\n In this situation, the numbers of incoming students are approximately\n\nthe same each term.\n Therefore, one would not have to take any change in size of the\n\ncohorts into consideration.\n The second disadvantage is that \" if course syllabi change, [ one\n\nneeds] to change the test\" ( handout).\n However, as has been already stated, there are fixed syllabi and\n\ntextbooks for each level.\n Consequently, this disadvantage also would not apply in this testing\n\nsituation.\n\n I would interpret the scores \" with reference to specified levels of\n\nability or content domain\" ( handout).\n For example, I stated earlier that I would include test tasks that\n\ntest different levels of competence regarding vocabulary, verb tenses,\n\ngrammar points, and syntax as they are presented in the different levels'\n\ncourse syllabi and textbooks.\n If a student is able to respond correctly to questions which include\n\nall vocabulary, verb tenses, grammar points, and syntax from level 1 and a\n\nfew from level 2, then I could interpret that score to mean that the student\n\nshould be placed in level 2.\n It would make it quite easy to show a correlation between various\n\ntest tasks and syllabi/textbook components, since I will have designed the\n\ntest tasks to be representative of certain ability levels and competence in\n\nspecific content domains.\n In addition, I will be using questions that are both objectively and\n\nsubjectively scored.\n This enables the test takers to demonstrate knowledge in a variety of\n\nways and allows the teachers to see the students' demonstrated ability levels\n\nthrough their performance.\n\n I would first need to determine selection points according to criteria\n\nfor certain decisions in order to decide how to place individuals into the\n\ndifferent levels ( handout).\n In this case, the teachers are not very experienced and have no\n\nformal training.\n In addition, they are assigned to teach specific levels.\n Therefore, I want to make sure that the students are being placed\n\nappropriately in each level, meaning that they need to demonstrate very well\n\ntheir abilities in the specific content domains for each level.\n Consequently, if there were four levels total, my placement would\n\nlook like this: If a score is 85% on test tasks from level one/level\n\ntwo/level three ( respectively) and below 85% from level two/level\n\nthree/level four ( respectively), place into level one/level two/level three\n\n( respectively).", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

When Don leaves the Waukesha Food Pantry with his bags\n\nof groceries, the 47-year-old father of three is headed for the most unlikely\n\nof destinations: his 2,000-square-foot house in the tranquil, rolling hills\n\nof this suburban community.\n\n  The home, with red double doors and a brick front, is set on two\n\nacres of landscape grounds.\n A swing set is prominent in the spacious back yard.\n\n\n  It 's not exactly the first place one would look for clients of\n\nthe local food pantry.\n\n  But Don represents some of the changing names and faces of people\n\nin need today - people with substantial assets who have unexpectedly lost\n\njobs in a faltering economy and are attempting to stave off financial\n\ncollapse.\n\n\n  While they are a small percentage of all people using pantries in\n\nSussex and Waukesha - an estimated 3% to 5% - their numbers are growing, and\n\nfood %antry%directors expect to see more of them in coming months.\n\n  \" People have to look at the needy in a different way,\" said\n\nCathy Bellovary, director of the Waukesha pantry.\n \" These people are coming in to keep a roof over their heads; it 's a\n\nway to sustain themselves.\"\n\n\n  For Don, who had been the primary breadwinner in his family, a\n\nsense of shame and remorse has driven him to hold on to the family home.\n He feels he should do whatever he can to keep the family 's situation\n\nfrom turning worse.\n\n  \" I could sell the house and get a cheaper one,\" he said.\n \" But my wife doesn't like the idea worth a damn.\n\n\n  The average home in Don 's neighborhood sold for\n\n&dollar;132,000, based on the most recent sales there, according to Kim Hase of\n\nFirst Realty of Waukesha.\n\n  Don, who has three teenage children, is concerned that as his\n\nfamily struggles to stay together during these difficult times, a move would\n\nbe too destabilizing for them.\n\n  \" The family 's really down on me now.\n They question why I can't hold a job,\" Don said.\n\n\n  He said that he would like to sell his boat, but that he can't\n\nfind a buyer.\n And while he has no significant credit card debt, he doesn't view\n\ncredit cards as a solution to his problems.\n\n \n\n  Both Don and his wife are doing what they can to earn money.\n Don 's wife has taken a full-time job, while her husband seeks\n\npermanent employment.\n Don is taking most of the jobs that have come his way - including a\n\nnewspaper delivery route.\n\n  However, with the exception of one job that didn't work out for\n\nDon, the combined earnings of Don and his wife are less than the wage Don\n\nearned before his layoff two years ago.\n\n  Looking back at circumstances that led to his current problems,\n\nDon said he might not have been as frugal as he could have been.\n He said he regretted a\n\n&dollar;27,000 second mortgage on his home, particularly since he owed only\n\n&dollar;20,000 on his first mortgage.\n\n  \" We had been frugal, but then we were influenced by the ease of\n\ncredit in the 1980 's,\" he said.\n\n  Asked whether he felt deserving of handouts while others were\n\nhomeless and in worse situations, Don said he believed that he had given to\n\nthe food pantry as much as he has taken.\n\n  \" The family 's really down on me now.\n\n\n\n  Although many of the newly jobless are reluctant to talk about\n\ntheir circumstances, Don and a couple from Sussex agreed to be interviewed on\n\nthe condition that they be identified by first names only.\n\n  Both families represent the almost 8.5 million Americans out of\n\nwork and searching for jobs made scarce by 17 months of recession.\n\n  The recession has had an impact on local food pantries, where\n\ndirectors said they started seeing more of the unemployed from high-paying\n\njobs as early as February.\n\n\n  After 23 years with a Waukesha metal manufacturing firm, Don is\n\none of those white-collar workers who lost a well-paying job when he was laid\n\noff in January 1990.\n\n\n  This summer, he made his first trip to the Waukesha Food Pantry.\n He remembers the day mostly by the reaction of his teenage son, who\n\nrefused to accompany him, embarrassed by the family 's changing fortunes.\n\n  Sussex residents Rob and Cindy are new to the food pantries, too.\n Rob was laid off in March from his factory job as an engine\n\nrepairman.\n The couple made their first trip to the Sussex Emergency Food Pantry\n\ntwo weeks ago, hoping to feed their family of six while holding on to their\n\nfive-bedroom house.\n A pantry worker remembers Cindy crying inconsolably as six bags of\n\nfood were filled for her.\n\n  For similar reasons, both families have decided to hold onto\n\ntheir homes and try to weather the hard times with the help of charitable\n\nagencies.\n Neither claims to be blameless for what has happened to them, nor so\n\nthey expect the unreserved sympathy of others.\n\n  Rob, 37, and Cindy, 30, who also have been taking interim jobs\n\nsince Rob 's layoff in March, said a neighbor called a local minister to refer\n\nthem to the local food pantry.\n\n  Rob said they didn't qualify for food stamps because of the value\n\nof their assets.\n But as money got tight they found themselves having to make decisions\n\nsuch as whether to buy milk for their children, or whether to pay they\n\nutility bills.\n\n  Rob said he would sell the house if he had to, but he wanted to\n\ntry to hold on to it.\n The couple bought the house in 1989 for about\n\n&dollar;87,000.  Houses in their neighborhood are selling for about\n\n&dollar;100,000 now, Rob said.\n\n \n\n  Cindy said she understood those who might criticize them for\n\nusing a food pantry while they still had a roof over their heads and vehicles\n\nin their garage.\n\n\n  Her husband, his face flushing with anger, remarked: \" I'm not 'm\n\nslougher; I'm a w 'mker.\n\n\n\n  Directors of the local food pantries agree that the tangible\n\nassets of a family shouldn't determine whether they are provided community\n\naid.\n They chafe at the idea that people must become destitute to benefit\n\nfrom their service.\n\n  Betty Mindemann has been director of the Sussex Emergency Food\n\nPantry since 1985.\n\n\n  \" We don't sit in judgment of anyone.\n That 's God 's way of doing it.\n The fact that they' 'rehere is important - it takes a lot for them\n\njust to walk through the door,\" she said.\n\n  The board of directors of the local pantries support the open\n\ndoor policy.\n At both pantries, anyone showing identification of residence may use\n\nthe service.\n\n  Bellovary, director of the Waukesha Food Pantry, noted that many\n\nof the clients who have had good jobs are supporters of pantries and other\n\ncharitable agencies and were likely to support them again when they got back\n\ninto the job market.\n\n \n\n  Not all clients of the pantries are on assistance, Mindemann\n\nsaid.\n The pantries also serve the working poor and those \" who fall\n\nbetween the cracks.\"\n\n  She said she had one client who lost a job that paid more than\n\n&dollar;50,000 a year and had sought aid at the pantry while he worked three\n\nfast-food jobs.\n\n  She also had a client who owned a\n\n&dollar;200,000 home and used the pantry to sustain his family until he could get\n\nback into the job market.\n\n  In many cases, families lack the savings to tide them through\n\ntough times, or they have already depleted their savings, Bellovary said.\n\n  \" We want to help those people as much as others,\" Bellovary\n\nsaid.\n\n\n  She added: \" The way I look at it, if we can keep people from\n\ngetting destitute, that 's what we 're here for.\n My feeling is that we don't want people to get to the point of total\n\ndestitution.\"", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1b40ba37-529f-457a-93e8-0cf4ed8c3e99", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.729007+00:00"}
{"text": "Transcription of therapy session with Evelyn Luckenbach, September\n\n28, 1981 \n\n \n\n  The father plays ukelele, holds it near to his face and croons to\n\nhis daughters, those with smudged faces and smiles of ignorance.\n He walks always on the sunny side of the street, he has no worries.\n But that girl in the yellow dress holding her knees, the one whose\n\nface, if we look closely, is tight with her smile, that girl already doesn't\n\nknow how to drop her worries. \n\n  There are other songs, songs about railroad men, traveling\n\nsalesmen, hoboes.\n All the men in the songs live happy and carefree, wandering the\n\ncountry with their pipes and bedrolls, leaving their worries on someone\n\nelse 's doorstep. \n\n  \" Sing the song about Charlie,\" the girl in the yellow dress asks\n\nevery time.\n This is the one where the man comes home to a family and brings gifts\n\nand sings of his travels.\n The chorus is something funny, something he makes up new every time\n\njust to make her laugh, and with this one, because he knows she likes it, he\n\nlooks into her eyes and sings directly to her. \n\n  The breath is always warm and smells tonight of metal, as if he\n\nhas eaten a chain link fence.\n The whorls and creases of his hands filled with grease, fingernails\n\nblack with it, but his face is clean and unlined, he is young still and his\n\nhazel eyes are surrounded by absolute white. \n\n  If they knew where they were already heading, one step at a time,\n\nwouldn't they pause longer here?\n In this hollow moment with just the ukelele, the untainted voice of a\n\nyoung man dreaming, the love of the girls that shows in their eyes like\n\nsomething taken for granted. \n\n  The mother is in the kitchen making a batch of fudge.\n She is still trying.\n When her girls listen to their father sing songs about freedom, she\n\npaces around the kitchen in her pant suit, thumbs through a cookbook, tries\n\nto imagine what does a normal mother do now?\n \" Make fudge,\" Betty Crocker tells her and the mother follows\n\ndirections still. \n\n  Two cups sugar, two squares unsweetened chocolate.\n\n\n  The pant suits were a gift from the father the same year that all\n\nthe scarves and flowered skirts appeared in the ditch down the road.\n Walking around the block the two sisters come upon such familiar\n\nthings: their mother 's scarves, her blue silk kimono, the pastel nightgowns\n\nthat always smell like her, bangles, flowered skirts, the blouse with all the\n\nanimals of the zoo walking across its yellow background in black patterns.\n\n\n\n  What would an ordinary child do?\n Run home thinking their house had been robbed?\n Inform the mother that all her best clothes were in the ditch around\n\nthe block?\n These girls do not think to question such an occurrence.\n If everything in the house were in the ditch, there must be a reason.\n If their mother herself were there, or if the girls woke up in the\n\nmiddle of the night covered in leaves, listening to traffic whiz by, what\n\ncould they do but say their prayers, roll over, and dream?\n\n\n  The elder girl takes the blue kimono and stuffs it in her shirt\n\nas a memento.\n She will sleep with it under her pillow and smell it for years, even\n\nafter the scent of her mother is only something she creates. \n\n  The mother is still trying, she has on the pant suit and her hair\n\nrises in a teased puff sprayed into place.\n Her cuticles have been removed.\n She has the purple pants with the green blouse and even the girls\n\nknow that they should be worn in matched pairs, but she does try and that\n\nmeans everything tonight while the father sings and strums and the girls sit\n\ntransfixed. \n\n  She stirs and cooks and waits for 234 degrees on the candy\n\nthermometer, not one degree more.\n She lets it cool to exactly 120 before beating in the vanilla.\n Then as the fudge lies hardening, she tries to remember to put\n\nsoftness in her face. \n\n  The mother poses for the picture with her pan of fudge in one\n\nhand and the house keys in the other.\n She is not getting ready to leave, but holds onto those keys because\n\nshe loses them otherwise and the father gets angry and doesn't allow her to\n\nleave the house unlocked. \n\n  Her face is hard and wild, the smile a forced form like the hair\n\nand clothes, the hands still stiff at her side and she stands on tiptoes as\n\nif she is about to sprint.\n Her eyes aren't hard to read, even at this distance.\n They say 'here 's your damn fudge' at the same time that they demand\n\ncollaboration, expect the girls to participate in the myth of her great\n\nmothering. \n\n  But the secrets are beginning to come out in her face and she\n\nkeeps her hands busy partly so they don't begin painting the walls, spreading\n\nthe fudge all over the white kitchen walls in patterns and words.\n That won't happen tonight though.\n Tonight, she cuts the fudge, gives the girls each a piece, gives the\n\nman two. \n\n  This mother, I try to understand her.\n I can see how she struggles to hold herself there, to keep the hands\n\nfrom dropping boiling water on the children.\n This mother, when she finishes frying chicken, she leaves the hot oil\n\nin a pan at the edge of the counter where a curious young child could pull it\n\ntowards her, looking for fudge, or dinner maybe. \n\n  I don't know what her secrets are, only that they demand\n\nsomething of her, they expect her to drop everything and pay tribute to what\n\nthey say in tiny, squirrely voices. \n\n  This mother did not give any part of herself to her children, she\n\nlet them come through her but she remained untouched.\n Now she feels no allegiance to them, no special compulsion to feed\n\nthem, stroke their hair, give them something safe to dream on.\n\n\n  This is home.\n A rented duplex on a dead end street with a train charging by every\n\nhalf hour at dinnertime and once or twice even in the middle of the night.\n The girl in the yellow dress can't sleep through the noise though she\n\ncounsels herself every night not to be scared by the sudden roaring, by the\n\nsilence afterward. \n\n  The girl in the yellow dress is easily frightened and the father\n\nenjoys scaring her.\n \" You'll 'll a kick out of this,\" he tells his friends before\n\nsneaking up on the girl and saying \" boo!\" in his deepest voice.\n The girl always jumps, always gives a short squeal, and then stands\n\nwith pounding heart in the circle of laughing men. \n\n  There are many ways to frighten her and when she cries he says, \"\n\nYou're s 'reensitive,\" in a voice of awe and confusion.\n She is sensitive, if that is the right word.\n That is why, even on this night when the father sings and jokes, when\n\nthe mother works in the kitchen baking fudge, even tonight, the girl in the\n\nyellow dress reads something in her mother 's eyes, feels the tremors as the\n\ntrain roars by and knows they convey more truth than anything else \n\n  They live in a duplex and the girl imagines in the other half of\n\ntheir house lives a mother and father, two daughters, a ukelele, a pant suit,\n\na yellow dress.\n In every house she imagines the same family arrangement, the same\n\nmothers and fathers, always two daughters, but never one sensitive like her,\n\none who scares so easily and feels alone even in a world populated by\n\nfamilies just like her own, all up and down the street. \n\n  The father hands her a jar of peanuts and when she opens it a\n\ncoiled snake on a spring pops out in her face causing her to scream and drop\n\nthe jar.\n Her father laughs and laughs, wiping his eyes.\n\n\n  There are the girls in their Easter dresses, white hats, gloves,\n\nanklets and white shoes with buckles on the sides.\n The dresses are almost the same but the elder girl likes more lace\n\nand frill and the younger demanded a simple hat, one without ribbons.\n Standing side by side you can tell they are sisters by the features\n\nand the way they both incline their heads slightly to the side, as if even as\n\nthey smile for the camera, they are asking a question. \n\n  I think they are asking who will be fooled by these photographs?\n Who will see us in our white dresses and hats, our flowery anklets\n\nand buckled Mary Janes and think we are ordinary children?\n Will they look at us and imagine bedtime stories, romps across the\n\nliving room floor with Daddy, shopping and cooking with Momma?\n\n\n  Maybe they stand a little straighter thinking that at least in\n\nthis frozen image they are two little girls, adorable, who couldn't love\n\nthem?\n Look at the oleander in bloom behind them.\n\n\n  It is a shame I cannot feel more for them.\n Even the father is innocent still, but the girl and I know what is to\n\ncome and knowing that, how can we forgive them this small happiness, this\n\nnight of tender ukelele playing, hopeful fudge baking, innocent picture\n\ntaking?\n The potential outcomes have not yet been narrowed, but none in this\n\nfamily is strong enough to hold off the train rumbling down its tracks to\n\nmeet them head on. \n\n  I think he knew his wife wouldn't stay in the kitchen in the pant\n\nsuits and teased hair much longer, so the father began snapping pictures of\n\nthe mother almost every day, something for the girls to remember maybe.\n In the pictures where he has taken her off guard, I can see most\n\nclearly the pain on this woman 's face, the future covering her eyes in\n\nshadows deeper than the flash could penetrate. \n\n  In one photograph, the image of the mother is blurred because she\n\nis still moving, caught in the motion of turning around to the photographer,\n\nher husband.\n The expression on her face is so angry, so hostile it frightens even\n\nme.\n\n\n  How it must have awed those two little girls.\n Imagine, their father merely says, \" turn around, Honey,\" and the\n\nwoman produces a look like that, like a trapped animal ready to kill. \n\n  The mother kept back a piece of herself when she gave birth to\n\nher daughters, she couldn't let go.\n Now she has too much inside, struggling to be spoken or painted or\n\nsung.\n And the girls are not whole.\n\n\n  The mother moves through the world in such a way that the girls\n\nwill only be ghosts following after, never filling in their own lives but\n\ntrying to take the burden off her, hoping she will give them that piece they\n\nneed, the missing information, the last drop to make them full, or if not\n\nthat, then at least the fix they need to keep on a little longer: the small\n\nlove-filled words she occasionally spoke, a moment when she truly saw them,\n\nthen smiled, then pulled them close. \n\n  This is home, these rooms with perfectly white walls, the red\n\nstuffed chair and flat, hard, green sofa.\n The bedroom where the parents sleep in warm, soft sheets the color of\n\nskin, the side porch where the girls lie on twin cots watching the moon move\n\nshadows, listening to conversations so private they are hissed and whispered\n\nand wept. \n\n  This is home, where the mother is overfull and the girls feel\n\nempty, where the father 's wandering feet are only temporarily nailed down.\n This is home: two girls overwhelmed by love for two imperfect parents\n\nwho are still trying, still young and hopeful and innocent, still unaware of\n\nhow quickly and easily everything could be broken, even the girls, even them.\n\n\n\n  \" You know a lot about them.\u001d\n Yes, I do know a lot about them.\n It seems I can just look at the pictures and imagine, but I have\n\nalways imagined too much.\n Maybe I am just making it up, pretending, make-believe.\n\n\n  \" I don't think you are making it up.\n I think you are remembering.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "315029c1-e3a3-49a1-a9df-010eeadad927",

{"text": "PART I ITEM 1.\n\nBUSINESS.\n\n  Exxon Corporation was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in\n\n1882.\n Divisions and affiliated companies of Exxon operate in the United\n\nStates and more than 80 other countries.\n Their principal business is energy, involving exploration for, and\n\nproduction of, crude oil and natural gas, manufacturing of petroleum products\n\nand transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.\n Exxon Chemical Company, a division of Exxon, is a major manufacturer\n\nand marketer of petrochemicals.\n Exxon is engaged in exploration for, and mining and sale of, coal and\n\nother minerals.\n Exxon also has an interest in electric power generation in Hong Kong.\n Affiliates of Exxon conduct extensive research programs in support of\n\nthese businesses.\n\n\n  The terms corporation, company, Exxon, our, we and its, as used\n\nin this report, sometimes refer not only to Exxon Corporation or to one of\n\nits divisions but collectively to all of the companies affiliated with Exxon\n\nCorporation or to any one or more of them.\n\n\n  The oil industry is highly competitive.\n There is competition within the industry and also with other\n\nindustries in supplying the energy and fuel needs of commerce, industry and\n\nindividuals.\n The corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of\n\nvarious goods or services in many national and international markets and\n\nemploys all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such\n\npurposes.\n\n  Exxon Chemical is organized into three business groups, each\n\nmanaged as a worldwide business with its own manufacturing, marketing and\n\ntechnology activities.\n It is a major producer of basic petrochemicals, including olefins and\n\naromatics, and a leading supplier of specialty rubbers and of additives for\n\nfuels and lubricants.\n The products manufactured include polyethylene and polypropylene\n\nplastics, plasticizers, specialty resins, specialty and commodity solvents,\n\nfertilizers and performance chemicals for oil field operations.\n\n\n  The operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates\n\nthroughout the world have been, and may in the future be, affected from time\n\nto time in varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations,\n\nsuch as forced divestiture of assets; restrictions on production, imports and\n\nexports; price controls; tax increases and retroactive tax claims;\n\nexpropriations of property; cancellation of contract rights and environmental\n\nregulations.\n Both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon\n\nthe corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable.\n\n\n  In 1993, the corporation spent\n\n&dollar;1,873 million ( of which\n\n&dollar;641 million were capital expenditures) on environmental conservation\n\nprojects and expenses worldwide, mostly dealing with air and water\n\nconservation.\n Total expenditures for such activities are expected to be about\n\n&dollar;2.0 billion in 1994 and 1995 ( with capital expenditures in each year\n\nrepresenting about 35 percent of the total) \n\n  Operating data and industry segment information for the\n\ncorporation are contained on pages F3, F20 and F27 of the accompanying\n\nfinancial section of the 1993 Annual Report to shareholders.\n Information on oil and gas reserves is contained on pages F24 and F25\n\nof the accompanying financial section of the 1993 Annual Report to\n\nshareholders.*\n\n\n  Part of the information in response to this item and to the\n\nSecurities Exchange Act Industry Guide 2 is contained in the accompanying\n\nfinancial section of the 1993 Annual Report to shareholders in Note 8, which\n\nnote appears on page F13, and on pages F3, and F22 through F27\n\n  Estimated proved reserves are shown on pages F24 and F25 of the\n\naccompanying financial section of the 1993 Annual Report to shareholders.\n No major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred\n\nsince December 31, 1993 that would cause a significant change in the\n\nestimated proved reserves as of that date.\n The oil sands reserves shown separately for Canada represent\n\nsynthetic crude oil expected to be recovered from Imperial Oil Limited 's 25\n\npercent interest in the net reserves set aside for the Syncrude project, as\n\npresently defined by government permit.\n For information on the standardized measure of discounted future net\n\ncash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves, see page F26 of the\n\naccompanying financial section of the 1993 Annual Report to shareholders.\n 2.\n ESTIMATES OF TOTAL NET PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES FILED WITH OTHER\n\nFEDERAL AGENCIES\n\n  During 1993, the company filed proved reserve estimates with the\n\nU.S. Department of Energy on Forms EIA-23 and EIA-28.\n The information is consistent with the 1992 Annual Report to\n\nshareholders with the exception of EIA-23 which covered total oil and gas\n\nreserves from Exxon-operated properties in the U.S. and does not include gas\n\nplant liquids <h <3. \n\n\n  Incorporated by reference to page F22 of the accompanying\n\nfinancial section of the 1993 Annual Report to shareholders.\n Average sales prices have been calculated by using sales quantities\n\nfrom our own production as the divisor.\n Average production costs have been computed by using net production\n\nquantities for the divisor.\n The volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids ( NGL) production\n\nused for this computation are shown in the reserves table on page F24 of the\n\naccompanying financial section of the 1993 Annual Report to shareholders.\n The net production volumes of natural gas available for sale by the\n\nproducing function used in this calculation are shown on page F27 of the\n\naccompanying financial section of the 1993 Annual Report to shareholders.\n The volumes of natural gas were converted to oil equivalent barrels\n\nbased on a conversion factor of six thousand cubic feet per barrel.\n 7.\n\n\n\n  Oil and gas exploration leases are acquired for varying periods\n\nof time, ranging from one to ten years.\n Production leases normally remain in effect until production\n\nceases.\n\n\n  Exploration permits are granted for varying periods of time with\n\nrenewals possible.\n Production leases are held as long as there is production on the\n\nlease.\n\n  Cold Lake oil sands leases were taken for an initial 21-year term\n\nin 1968-69 and renewed for a second 21-year term in 1989-1990.\n Athabasca oil sands leases were taken for an initial 21-year term in\n\n1958-1961 and renewed for a second 21-year term in 1979-1982.\n\n\n  Licenses issued prior to 1977 were for an initial period of six\n\nyears with an option to extend the license for a further 40 years on no more\n\nthan half of the license area.\n Licenses issued between 1977 and 1979 were for an initial period of\n\nfour years, after which one-third of the acreage was required to be\n\nrelinquished, followed by a second period of three years, after which an\n\nadditional one-third of the acreage was required to be relinquished, with an\n\noption to extend the license for a further 30 years on the remaining\n\none-third of the acreage.\n Subsequent licenses are for an initial period of six or seven years\n\nwith an option to extend for a total license period of 24 to 36 years on no\n\nmore than half the license area.\n\n  Netherlands Onshore: Exploration drilling permits are issued for\n\na period of two to five years.\n Production concessions are granted after discoveries have been made,\n\nunder conditions which are negotiated with the government.\n Normally, they are field-life concessions covering an area defined by\n\nhydrocarbon occurrences.\n\n  Offshore: Prospecting licenses issued prior to March 1976 were\n\nfor a 15-year period, with relinquishment of about 50 percent of the original\n\narea required at the end of ten years.\n Subsequent licenses are for ten years with relinquishment of about 50\n\npercent of the original area required after six years.\n For commercial discoveries within a prospecting license, a production\n\nlicense is issued for a 40-year period.\n\n\n  Licenses issued prior to 1972 were for a total period of 46\n\nyears, with relinquishment of at least one-fourth of the original area\n\nrequired at the end of the sixth year and another one-fourth at the end of\n\nthe ninth year.\n Subsequent licenses are for a total period of 36 years, with\n\nrelinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the end\n\nof the sixth year.\n\n\n  Exploration permits are granted for periods of three to five\n\nyears, renewable up to two times accompanied by substantial acreage\n\nrelinquishments: 50 percent of the acreage at first renewal; 25 percent of\n\nthe remaining acreage at second renewal.\n Upon discovery of commercial hydrocarbons, a production concession is\n\ngranted for up to 50 years, renewable in periods of 25 years each.\n\n\n  Onshore: Acreage terms are fixed by the individual state and\n\nterritory governments.\n These terms and conditions vary significantly between the states and\n\nterritories.\n Production licenses are generally granted for an initial term of 21\n\nyears, with subsequent renewals, each for 21 years, for the full area.\n\n  Offshore: Exploration permits are granted for six years with\n\npossible renewals of five-year periods to a total of 26 years.\n A 50 percent relinquishment of remaining area is mandatory at the end\n\nof each renewal period.\n Production licenses are for 21 years, with renewals of 21 years for\n\nthe life of the field.\n\n\n  Exploration and production activities are governed by production\n\nsharing contracts negotiated with the national oil company.\n These contracts have an overall term of 20 years with possible\n\nextensions to the exploration or development periods.\n The exploration period is three years with the possibility of a\n\ntwo-year extension, after which time areas with no commercial discoveries\n\nmust be relinquished.\n The development period is two years from commercial discovery, with\n\nan option to extend the period for an additional two years and possibly\n\nlonger under special circumstances.\n Areas from which commercial production has not started by the end of\n\nthe development period must be relinquished.\n The total production period is 15 years from first commercial\n\nlifting, not to exceed the overall term of the contract. <hIndonesia \n\n  Exxon 's operations previously conducted under a contract of work\n\nagreement converted to a production sharing contract in late 1993, with a\n\nterm of 20 years.\n Other production sharing contracts in Indonesia have an overall term\n\nof up to 30 years.\n\n\n  Production sharing agreements negotiated with the government\n\nentitle Exxon to participate in exploration operations within a designated\n\narea during the exploration period.\n In the event of a commercial discovery, the company is entitled to\n\nproceed with development and production operations during the development\n\nperiod.\n The length of these periods and other specific terms are negotiated\n\nprior to executing the production sharing agreement.\n Existing production operations have a development period extending 20\n\nyears from first commercial declaration made in November 1985.\n\n\n  Exploration and production activities are governed by concession\n\nagreements negotiated with the government.\n These agreements generally permit three exploration periods, with the\n\nfirst period being three years, and the remaining two optional periods being\n\ntwo years each.\n Production operations have an overall term of 30 years, with an\n\noption for a ten-year extension. <hColombia \n\n  Prior to 1974, exploration, development and production rights\n\nwere granted for up to 30 years through concessions.\n Since 1974, the association contract has been the basic form of\n\nparticipation in new acreage.\n With this form of contract, exploration rights are granted for up to\n\na maximum of six years.\n After a discovery is made, the development period extends for 22\n\nyears with relinquishment of 50 percent at the end of six years, 50 percent\n\nof the retained area after eight years and all remaining area except\n\ncommercial fields after ten years.\n\n\n  During 1993, exploration activities were coordinated by Exxon\n\nExploration Company and producing activities by Exxon Company, U.S.A., both\n\ndivisions of Exxon Corporation.\n Exploration and delineation of additional hydrocarbon resources\n\ncontinued.\n At year-end 1993, Exxon 's inventory of undeveloped acreage otaled\n\n3.7 million net acres.\n Exxon is active in areas onshore, offshore and in Alaska.\n A total of 14 net exploration and delineation wells were completed\n\nduring 1993.\n During 1993, 171 net development wells were completed within and\n\naround mature fields in the inland lower 48 states.\n Exxon has an interest in over 25 enhanced oil recovery projects in\n\nthe ower 48 states which contributed nearly 60 thousand barrels per day of\n\nincremental production in 1993. Exxon 's net acreage in the Gulf of Mexico\n\nat year-end 1993 was 1.4 million acres.\n A total of 36 net exploratory and development wells were completed\n\nduring the year.\n Production was initiated from the Zinc field in mid-1993 via a\n\nsatellite subsea production template to the Alabaster platform, which started\n\nup in 1992.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "58ac9882-caf8-41fa-87b5-025146e74412", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.731719+00:00"}
{"text": "Infectious diseases stimulated the early development of\n\nepidemiology.\n Early epidemiologic investigations of infectious diseases focused on\n\nenvironmental contamination rather than person-to-person transmission.\n More recently, however, chronic diseases have provided greater impetus\n\nfor the development of new quantitative methodology in epidemiology.\n Now, with the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus infection,\n\nepidemiology is refocusing its efforts on infectious diseases.\n\n  The risk assessment tools being applied to the acquired\n\nimmunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS) epidemic are those that were developed for\n\nchronic diseases.\n However, the usual formulation of risk assessment parameters, such as\n\nodds ratios, rate ratios, relative risks, and risk differences, which are so\n\nuseful in chronic disease epidemiology, do not provide stable assessments of\n\nrisk for factors that affect contagion.\n Because with contagious diseases the outcome in one study subject is\n\nrelated to changes in risk for other study subjects, risk assessment at the\n\npopulation level does not correspond to a summation of risks at the\n\nindividual level as it does with chronic diseases.\n To relate risk assessments at the individual and population levels,\n\nknowledge of contact patterns is essential.\n The purposes of this paper are 1) to demonstrate the lack of stability\n\nof chronic disease risk measures with contagious diseases, 2) to demonstrate\n\nhow risk assessment for contagious diseases depends upon assessment of\n\ncontact patterns even when contact patterns do not cause appreciable\n\ndifferences in the overall epidemic pattern, and 3) to present a new\n\nformulation for the action of one important determinant of contact patterns\n\nin sexually transmitted diseases, namely biased selection of partners from\n\nthe potential partners encountered.\n This new formulation supersedes our previous selective mixing\n\nformulation ( 1).\n\n\n  Consider the following variables which might be collected in\n\neither prospective or cross-sectional studies of human immuno-deficiency\n\nvirus infection in gay males: 1) usual number of episodes of sex acts of type\n\nS, in 1 week; 2) usual number of episodes of another type of sex act, which\n\nwe will call S2, in I week; 3) usual proportion of all partners met at site\n\nA,; and 4) usual proportion of all partners met at site A2.\n All of these variables might be correlated.\n Thus, if the major focus of interest is the risk of the type of sex\n\nact S, its effects would probably be assessed using a multiple variable\n\nanalysis.\n Given the dichotomous outcome of infection, the most likely choice\n\nfor such an analysis would be a logistic regression analysis.\n The logistic regression parameters could be translated into odds\n\nratios.\n From a cross-sectional study, these would be the prevalence odds\n\nratios; from a prospective study, the incidence odds ratios would be\n\nestimated.\n In their interpretation of the relevance of these estimated odds\n\nratios for risk assessment, epidemiologists would most likely use these\n\nparameters directly as approximations to risk ratios or rate ratios.\n Alternatively, with prospective data, they might attempt to assess\n\nrate ratios or rate differences more directly with a survival analysis.\n During the course of an epidemic, as the overall incidence rises, the\n\nabsolute risk or rate of infection rises.\n As a consequence, epidemiologists would expect risk or rate\n\ndifference measures to vary.\n However, they are likely to presume that ratio measures will remain\n\nmore constant.\n\n  There may be two problems with such risk assessment procedures.\n First, inconsistencies of the causal factors generating the data with\n\nthe assumptions of the analytic model may mean that the \" control\" procedures\n\ndistort relations instead of eliminating the effects of confounding.\n Second, even if ratio parameters of odds, risks, or rates are\n\nestimated validly, those measures might not remain constant over the course\n\nof the epidemic.\n Large odds ratios might be expected to shrink and small ones might be\n\nexpected low grow.\n Thus, the odds ratios, even from prospective studies, would not form\n\na good basis on which to predict future risk patterns.\n This paper seeks to illustrate the second problem of parameter\n\ninstability without directly addressing the first problem of parameter\n\nestimation validity.\n\n  Any risk measures that rose or fell dramatically over time would\n\nnot be useful for assessing current or future risk.\n They would be even less useful if they rose or fell even though the\n\nbasic causal factors remained constant.\n One way to assess the expected behavior of an epidemiologic parameter\n\nis to evaluate it in an idealized simulation of the underlying causal\n\nsystem.\n\n\n  We create here an idealized computer population and causal system\n\nfor human immunodeficiency virus transmission.\n The point of this model is to abstract the essential phenomenon of\n\nperson-to-person transmission in sexual relationships.\n To avoid confusion and unnecessary complications, we will make\n\nseveral simplifying assumptions.\n For example, we will assume that insertive and receptive sex acts\n\nhave the same probabilities of transmission and therefore do not need to be\n\ndistinguished in our model.\n Such equal transmission probabilities probably do not pertain to any\n\ntype of sex act, and therefore we will stick with symbolic names for our sex\n\nacts.\n\n\n  1 ) There are only two types of sex acts.\n S, which is a relatively low-risk type of sex act, and S2, which\n\ncarries four times the risk of transmission per act as S.\n We might think of S, as corresponding to oral sex and S2, as\n\ncorresponding to anal sex. or S, as corresponding to sex with a condom and S2\n\nas corresponding to sex without a condom.\n\n  2) There are only two types of individuals: homosexual males who\n\nengage in only S, and homosexual males who engage equally in S, and S2.\n We will consider the first group, lacking the risk factor, unexposed\n\nand the second group, having the risk factor, exposed.\n\n  3) Two hundred unexposed persons and 100 exposed persons enter\n\nthis population each month.\n\n\n  4) People leave the population for reasons not connected with\n\nhuman immuno- deficiency virus infection at a rate of one per 600 per month,\n\nindependent of when they entered the population.\n\n  5) Before human immunodeficiency virus arrives, our hypothetic\n\npopulation is at equilibrium with a steady 120,000 X1 individuals and 60,000\n\nX2 individuals.\n\n  6) Once human immunodeficiency virus arrives in this population,\n\nthe only source of infection is through sexual transmission.\n\n  7) All individuals in the population have 20 sexual encounters\n\nper month, and each encounter is with a different person.\n\n  8) Only one type of sex act, either S, or S2, is engaged in at\n\neach encounter, so both partners have to do the same thing.\n\n  9) There are only two social settings ( or sexual partner\n\nmarketplaces) where partners can be met: A, and A2.\n\n  10) Within each social setting, mixing is either random or\n\ndetermined by a selective mixing formulation to be presented below .\n\n  11) One out of 800 sex acts of type S, between an infected person\n\nand an uninfected person results in transmission, and one out of 200 sex acts\n\nof type S2 results in transmission.\n Since only half of the acts in the exposed group are at the higher\n\nrate, this fourfold difference in transmission probabilities would translate\n\nto a 2.5 rate ratio if the partners of the exposed group and the unexposed\n\ngroup had equal probabilities of being infected.\n\n  12) One out of every 120 infected persons develops AIDS every\n\nmonth, independent of the time that he became infected.\n\n\n \n\n\n  Using the formulation for structured mixing ( 2) and the\n\nsymbolization shown in table 1, the differential equations describing\n\ntransmission in our hypothetic population would be\n\n  - formula here-\n\n  The three terms in the first equation are the inflow of new\n\npeople into group I, the outflow of current people for reasons other than\n\ninfection, and the rate at which uninfected persons become infected.\n This third term is the number of encounters of all persons in group I\n\nwith all persons in group J in social setting K where sex act S takes place (\n\nCu) times the proportion of I individuals in those encounters who are\n\nsusceptible ( XJ/NJ) times the proportion of J individuals in those\n\nencounters who are infected ( YJ/NJ) times the probability of transmission\n\ngiven sex act S ( - formula-).\n In the second equation, the first term is the outflow of infected\n\npersons from the population due to their developing AIDS; the second term is\n\nthe outflow for reasons not related to infection, and the third corresponds\n\nto the individuals from the first equation who are newly infected.\n\n\n  This model corresponds to random mixing when the following two\n\nconditions hold: 1 ) there is random or \" proportional\" partner choice in\n\neach social setting and 2) the fraction of group I 's contacts that are in any\n\ngiven social setting K is the same for all K.\n\n  Condition I corresponds mathematically to the following equation\n\n( terms are defined in table 1):\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  represents the fraction of all sexual contacts of type s in\n\nsetting K that are made by group J.\n Multiplying this fraction by - formula- represents the assumption\n\nthat this same fraction gives the fraction of group l S type S, setting K\n\ncontacts that are with members of group J.\n In the \" random\" mixing scenario we present here, - insert formulae\n\nhere-.\n\n  Mixing will be called \" structured\" when population subgroups\n\nhave different functions for their contacts in different social settings, but\n\nwithin any social setting the mixing I5 consistent with equation 2.\n In the structured mixing scenarios considered in this paper, - insert\n\nformulae here-.\n\n  Mixing will be called \" selective\" when each population subgroup\n\nhas the same fraction of its contacts in each social setting, but within each\n\nsocial setting, mixing is determined by equation 3 below instead of equation\n\n2.\n Mixing will be called \" combined structured and selective\" when\n\nsubgroups do not make equal proportions of their contacts in different social\n\nsettings and within each social setting mixing is determined by equation\n\n3.\n\n\n  The following formulation of selective mixing is intended to\n\nsupplant our previously published, less manageable formulation of selective\n\nmixing ( 1).\n The basic parameters of selectiveness in our model are the number of\n\nsocial encounters per unit of time that an individual in group I makes in\n\nsocial setting K that have the potential to become sexual partners of type -\n\nformula- and the probability that such encounters with specific types of\n\npartners J result in sex of type S ( Q,I,J,S,K).\n These Q parameters represent the selectiveness with which individuals\n\nact on the T parameters or their opportunities for sex.\n\n  For simplification, let us consider the situation for one type of\n\nsex within one social setting, so that we can drop the S and K subscripts.\n Now let-insert formula-where the meaning of the terms is summarized\n\nin table 1.\n In equation 3,-insert formula-represents the proportion of potential\n\nsexual encounters that are due to group j.\n Multiplying this fraction by T, NI essentially assumes that the\n\nsocial mixing leading to sexual proposals is proportional ( or random).\n Finally, the QIJ factor represents biased rates of rejection of those\n\npotential sexual encounters.\n Note that the CJ calculated with equation 3 must meet the following\n\nconstraint:\n\n \n\n  By substituting from equation 3, we compute -

{"text": "There has been continuing concern about the neurologic\n\nmanifestations of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-I) infection ever\n\nsince early reports of neurologic complications associated with acquired\n\nimmmunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS) appeared in literature ( 1-3).\n Much of the concern has centered around a constellation of\n\nneuropsychiatric symptoms known as AIDS-associated dementia or AIDS dementia\n\ncomplex, originally described by Snider et al. as \" subacute encephalitis\" (\n\n3), because it may develop insidiously.\n It has been estimated that up to two thirds of AIDS patients who do\n\nnot develop some other central nervous system disease may develop primary\n\ndementia ( 4).\n\n  Navia et al. ( 4) and Price et al. ( 5), among others, have\n\ndescribed the characteristic abnormalities associated with AIDS dementia.\n In general, they include difficulty in complex sequencing, impaired\n\nfine and rapid motor movement, reduced verbal fluency with retention of\n\nvocabulary and object naming, and complaints of forgetfulness despite good\n\nmemory retention upon testing.\n These impairments have been found to be most prominent with testing\n\nformats involving time pressure, problem solving, visual scanning, visual\n\nmotor integration and alternation between stimuli.\n\n  Recently , there have been reports of neurologic manifestations in\n\nearly HIV-I infection, before the full development of clinically apparent\n\nAIDS ( 6-8).\n While the point at which neurologic impairment first becomes\n\nclinically apparent in the course of HIV-l infection remains uncertain,\n\nhypotheses about the progression of HIV-I central nervous system involvement\n\nfrom initial infection to end-stage disease have led to increased speculation\n\nthat cognitive dysfunction may exist in otherwise asymptomatic HlV-1-positive\n\nindividuals.\n This study was undertaken to attempt to estimate the effect of\n\nseropositivity on Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test scores in\n\notherwise healthy individuals with early HIV-I infection.\n\n\n  The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is a\n\nmultiple-aptitude battery consisting of 10 individual tests that has been\n\nadministered to all civilian applicants for military enlistment during the\n\npast 15 years.\n It is designed to predict what a person could accomplish with\n\ntraining or further education, and especially to measure potential for\n\noccupations that require formal courses of instruction or on-the-job\n\ntraining.\n It also provides a general measure of academic ability and some\n\nindication of future job performance.\n There is a large body of literature documenting the validity of the\n\nArmed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery and its components ( 9-13).\n The battery is administered prior to the preinduction medical\n\nexamination, which since 1985 has included testing for antibody to HIV-I (\n\n14, 15).\n\n  For the purpose of this study, the individual tests were\n\nconsidered in three groups.\n The first group consists of general academic tests which provide an\n\noverall measure of trainability.\n These tests are: General Science, which measures knowledge of\n\nphysical and biologic sciences; Arithmetic Reasoning, which measures the\n\nability to solve arithmetic word problems; Word Knowledge, which tests the\n\nability to select correct meaning and synonyms for a word presented in\n\ncontext; and Paragraph Comprehension.\n which tests the ability to obtain information from written\n\npassages.\n\n  The next two tests, Numerical Operations and Coding Speed, are\n\nperhaps the most important, because while all 10 tests are timed, these two\n\nare performed under the greatest time pressure.\n The former test requires the performance of 50 arithmetic\n\ncomputations in a speeded context of 3 minutes, and the latter measures the\n\nability to use a key in assigning four-digit code numbers to 84 words in a\n\nspeeded context of 7 minutes.\n\n  The last four tests are specific vocational skills tests that\n\nmeasure knowledge in particular areas.\n Auto and Shop Information measures knowledge of automobiles, tools,\n\nand shop terminology and practices; Mathematics Knowledge tests knowledge of\n\nhigh school mathematics principles, including basic algebra and geometry;\n\nMechanical Comprehension measures knowledge of mechanical and physical\n\nprinciples and the ability to visualize how illustrated objects work; and\n\nElectronics Information measures knowledge of electricity and\n\nelectronics.\n\n  Four individual tests are summed according to the following\n\nformula to derive the Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite: Arithmetic\n\nReasoning Word Knowledge + Paragraph Comprehension + 1/2 Numerical\n\nOperations.\n The Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite is the most widely used\n\ncombination of individual test scores.\n It is used to determine an applicant 's mental category, and it\n\ncorrelates with an individual 's mental aptitude on other intelligence tests (\n\n15, 16).\n Table I provides a summary of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude\n\nBattery component tests.\n\n  Test and demographic data were extracted from the Military\n\nEntrance Processing Stations induction testing data base for an 18-month\n\nperiod from October 1985 through March 1987.\n Records without HIV-l test results or Armed Services Vocational\n\nAptitude Battery test scores were eliminated, leaving 975,489 observations;\n\n1,283 of these were HIV- 1 - positive cases.\n Five controls per case were chosen matching on US postal ZIP code\n\nalone.\n using a computer algorithm developed by one of the authors ( F. W.).\n This algorithm chose controls systematically with a pseudorandom\n\nstart.\n Of the 1,283 cases. 1.275 matched on all five ZIP code digits for the\n\nfull five controls.\n The rest matched on a combination of three-, four- or five-digit ZIP\n\ncodes.\n\n  After matching, the analysis file had 7,698 observations.\n Exploratory analysis of the data and univariate analysis of the test\n\nscores were performed.\n Table 2 shows the unadjusted mean raw aptitude test scores.\n For almost all of the tests, the HIV-l-positive group had a lower\n\nmean score.\n Because our sample sizes were so large, the standard errors were\n\nsmall. and all the differences except one were nominally statistically\n\nsignificant ( by  t  test, variance unequal) at the  @\n\n = 0.01 level.\n The magnitudes of the differences were also small, though, especially\n\nwith respect to the sample standard deviations, which were much larger than\n\nthe actual differences for each of the scores.\n Therefore, we anticipated that after adjustment for age, race, sex,\n\nand other factors, the HIV-I effect would diminish.\n\n  Further exploration was done prior to conducting the regression\n\nanalysis.\n\n\nvariables ( test scores).\n ) variable against\n\nthe Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite to look for outliers and\n\ninteractions.\n One extreme outlier was identified and eliminated; no interactions\n\nwere found.\n All individuals who were failed on subsequent physical examination,\n\ndue to abnormal skin/lymphatic conditions ( such as enlarged lymph nodes or\n\nbenign or malignant tumors of the skin) were eliminated to preclude\n\napplicants from the final analysis who had clinical HIV-I disease.\n\n\n  Table 3 illustrates some of the likely demographic confounders in\n\nthe analysis data set.\n The HIV-I-positive applicants were more likely to be male, to be\n\nblack, to be older, and to have a history of prior military service, all of\n\nwhich were considered likely determinants of scores.\n The regression analysis was used to adjust for these and other\n\nconfounders and to identify any remaining HIV-l effect.\n The design fixes the ratio of HIV-1-positive to HIV-l-negative\n\nindividuals at 1:5, and by matching on ZIP code, we have attempted to control\n\nfor geographic variation.\n\n  To make the regression coefficients comparable with one another,\n\nwe adjusted all test scores to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n Since our outcome variable ( test score) was continuous, a multiple\n\nlinear regression model was built.\n SAS analytical software was used to conduct the analysis ( 17).\n To choose the best model initially, we examined main effects and\n\ninteraction terms for the Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite.\n The model derived was sensitive enough to detect an HIV-I effect of\n\napproximately 0.07 standard deviation for most of the aptitude tests at\n\n @  = 0.01.\n ( That was less than a l-point difference in raw score for each of\n\nthe tests except the Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite, where it was\n\njust under 1.5 points.)\n\n  Each of the 10 standardized individual test scores was then\n\nregressed on the same group of predictors that was used in the main effects\n\nmodel for the Armed Forces Qualifying Test.\n High leverage points with poor fits were identified and eliminated\n\nfrom each regression, and after the distribution of the residuals was\n\nchecked, the regressions were repeated.\n This checking and correcting improved the fits only slightly,\n\nhowever.\n Finally, each individual 's Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite\n\nscore was used as an independent predictor variable in a final set of\n\nregressions to control for individual variation in basic intellectual\n\ncapacity.\n\n\n  The results of the initial regression analysis using the Armed\n\nForces Qualifying Test composite as the outcome variable are shown in table\n\n4.\n The listed effects represent the number of standard deviations that\n\nan individual 's score was predicted to change per unit of change in the\n\npredictor variable.\n Ninety-nine percent confidence intervals are also shown.\n Years of education was a powerful and highly significant predictor,\n\nwith each year adding nearly 0.16 standard deviation ( SD) to an applicant 's\n\nArmed Forces Qualifying Test composite score.\n The strongest categorical effects identified were racial/ethnic ones.\n Women tended to have slightly higher scores than men.\n HIV-I seropositivity lowered an applicant 's score by 0.09 SD, enough\n\nto be nominally statistically significant; however, the total regression \n\nR  2 for the model was only 0.21, so much of the variability was not\n\nbeing accounted for.\n\n  As for the remaining predictors, prior military service was not\n\nsignificant in these data but was allowed to remain in the model because it\n\ndid contribute in some of the later regressions, and we wanted to have a\n\nconsistent model.\n The branch of service for which the individual was applying was also\n\nan independent predictor; applicants to all other armed services tended to\n\nhave higher scores than Army applicants.\n No interactions between HIV-l status and any other predictor were\n\nidentified.\n\n  The results of the individual regression analyses for the effect\n\nof HIV- I positivity on each test score are shown in table 5.\n The same main effects model was used.\n In general, HIV-1-positive status tended to lower scores slightly,\n\nwhile most of the regression  R2  values remained quite low,\n\nindicating that much of the variability in test scores w as independent of\n\nthe factors in our model.\n This was expected, however, because if test scores were highly\n\ncorrelated with demographic factors, rather than individual variability,\n\nthere would be no need to administer them as predictors of future\n\nperformance.\n\n  Among the general academic tests at the top of table 5, there\n\nappears to be no HIV-1 effect upon word knowledge or paragraph comprehension,\n\nwhich is consistent with a priori expectations, based on what is known about\n\nHIV-I dementia.\n We expected that Numerical Operations and Coding Speed would be the\n\nmost sensitive indicators of an HIV-l effect, along with Arithmetic\n\nReasoning.\n which involves solving arithmetic word problems.\n For Arithmetic Reasoning, there was a clearly significant decrement;\n\nfor Numerical Operations, there was a marginal ( though statistically\n\nsignificant) HIV-I-positive decrement; and for Coding Speed, HIV-I-positive\n\nstatus appeared to marginally improve an applicant 's score.\n The largest negative effects occurred among the four vocational tests\n\nat the bottom.\n\n  Because all of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery\n\ntest 's components arc to some degree interrelated with each other and with\n\nmeasures of general intelligence, Pearson correlation coefficients between\n\nthe individual tests were calculated.\n Most of the tests correlated fairly well with each of the other\n\ntests, with the exception of Numerical Operations and Coding Speed, which\n\nonly correlated well with each other.\n The Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite, however, correlated well\n\nwith all of the tests.\n Since the Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite represents a measure\n\nof an individual 's mental aptitude ( 15, 16), the Armed Forces Qualifying\n\nTest composite score was added as a predictor variable in another set of\n\nregressions to control for individual variation and further isolate the HIV-I\n\neffect on the remaining individual tests, apart from any effect on general\n\nintelligence.\n Those individual tests which are included in the Armed Forces\n\nQualifying Test composite were excluded from this analysis, with the\n\nexception of Numerical Operations, in which case the composite was calculated\n\nwithout the Numerical Operations component when used as a predictor variable\n\nfor that regression.\n\n  The results of this final set of regressions using the Armed\n\nForces Qualifying Test composite as a predictor ( table 6) were helpful.\n values roughly doubled for all of the test scores,\n\nand the magnitude of the HIV-I effect consistently diminished, with the\n\nexception of Coding Speed, which then showed a significant improvement with\n\nHIV-I-positive status.\n One must be cautious in interpreting these results, however.\n The approach used will automatically diminish the magnitude of the\n\nHIV-I effect on the individual tests, since part of the effect is already\n\nincluded in the Armed Forces Qualifying Test composite score as an effect on\n\ngeneral intelligence.\n Only the improvement in Coding Speed for HIV-1-seropositives went\n\nagainst this expectation, as the magnitude increased, and if this test truly\n\nis a sensitive indicator, these results would tend to discount the\n\nsignificance of the HIV-I-positive effect on the other test scores.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "bfc0903a-4471-4b44-9f3c-5b011230247e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.734452+00:00"}
{"text": "When I wrote to you a year ago, the global economy was\n\nexperiencing profound disruption.\n The financial system was freezing up.\n Many companies and entire industries were pulling in their horns,\n\nhoping simply to ride out the storm.\n\n\n  Nonetheless, I said that we felt confident heading into 2009.\n We were entering the year strong, and we expected to exit it stronger.\n\n\n\n  A year later, despite an environment that remains very\n\nchallenging, I am happy to report that your company has continued to\n\noutperform our industry and the market at large.\n We delivered strong results in 2009, once again achieving record\n\npre-tax earnings, record earnings per share and record free cash flow despite\n\nreduced revenues.\n At the same time, we continued to deliver superior returns to you,\n\nour owners.\n Most importantly, we are well positioned to grow as the economy\n\nbegins to recover. \n\n  The explanation for this performance and for our optimism about\n\nboth the near-term and the longer-term future is threefold.\n It rests, first, on the ongoing transformation of our company;\n\nsecond, on our focused strategy to capture the large opportunity of a\n\nglobally integrating world; and third, on a business model that reliably\n\ngenerates strong profits and cash, giving us the financial flexibility to\n\ninvest for future growth. \n\n  I will talk about each of these factors in detail in this letter.\n It is important for you to understand the ways in which IBM today is\n\na very different company than it was just a few years ago.\n This repositioning explains why we have demonstrated such stability\n\nand strong results during this downturn and why we believe we will benefit as\n\nthe economy recovers and growth returns. \n\n  Two thousand nine was a tough year by any measure, but IBM 's\n\nperformance was indicative both of our high-value market position and of the\n\ndiscipline we apply to our strategy and operations.\n Since the dot-com crash in 2002, we have added\n\n&dollar;12 billion to IBM 's pre-tax profit base, increased our pre-tax margin 2.5\n\ntimes, quadrupled our earnings per share and more than doubled our free cash\n\nflow.\n Cumulatively, we have generated about\n\n&dollar;80 billion of free cash flow. \n\n  Our strong 2009 continued this record of superior performance:\n\nIBM 's gross profit margin rose for the sixth consecutive year to 45.7\n\npercent, up 9.2 points since 2003.\n Our pre-tax income margin rose to 18.9 percent.\n Both margins are at their highest in more than a decade.\n We achieved this by driving productivity and continuing to shift our\n\nbusiness mix to more profitable segments.\n Once again, more than 90 percent of our segment profit in 2009 was\n\nfrom software, services and financing. \n\n  We have continued to achieve strong EPS growth.\n Last year was another record, with diluted earnings per share of\n\n&dollar;10.01, up 13 percent.\n This marked seven straight years in which we have grown EPS by double\n\ndigits. \n\n  IBM has consistently generated strong cash flow, a key indicator\n\nof real business performance.\n In 2009 our free cash flow, excluding the year-to-year change in\n\nGlobal Financing receivables, was\n\n&dollar;15.1 billion, an increase of\n\n&dollar;800 million from 2008.\n IBM ended 2009 with\n\n&dollar;14 billion of cash and marketable securities.  SSince the dot-com\n\ncrash in 2000, we have added\n\n&dollar;12 billion to IBM 's pre-tax profit base and increased our pre-tax margin .5\n\ntimes, our earnings per share by 4 times and free cash flow more than\n\ndoubled. \n\n  Our revenue was\n\n&dollar;95.8 billion, down 5 percent at constant currency.\n Nonetheless, in 2009 we grew pre-tax income from continuing\n\noperations by 9 percent, to\n\n&dollar;18.1 billion, our highest ever.\n\n  Our superior cash flow has enabled us to invest in the business\n\nand to generate substantial returns to investors.\n Our 2009 cash investment was\n\n&dollar;1.2 billion for six acquisitions five of them in key areas of software.\n And after investing\n\n&dollar;5.8 billion in R&D and\n\n&dollar;3.7 billion in net capital expenditures, we were able to return more than\n\n&dollar;10 billion to you\n\n&dollar;7.4 billion through share repurchase and\n\n&dollar;2.9 billion through dividends.\n Last year 's dividend increase was 10 percent, marking the 14th year\n\nin a row in which we have raised our dividend. \n\n  In sum, with our excellent financial position, strong balance\n\nsheet, solid recurring revenue, strong profit streams and unmatched global\n\nreach, we are confident about the year ahead, and beyond.\n Indeed, we achieved our 2010 objective of\n\n&dollar;10 to\n\n&dollar;11 in earnings per share one year early.\n We believe that we will again grow EPS by double digits this year,\n\nreaching at least\n\n&dollar;11. \n\n  Today, many of our competitors are emulating our moves.\n For instance, several have gone on an acquisition binge to get into\n\nnew spaces.\n However, there is a vast difference between what your company has\n\ndone amassing truly differentiating technology and skills, and focusing on\n\nthe needs of enterprise clients and what others are doing, largely to\n\ncompensate for rapidly commoditizing business models. \n\n  As the new decade begins, some in our industry still seem to\n\nbelieve that history will repeat itself, for example, that clients will\n\ninvest in IT simply because of product upgrade cycles.\n Once again, we have a different view.\n We believe that clients will only invest in what delivers compelling,\n\nquantifiable business value.\n We believe that the fundamental shifts I described earlier will\n\ncontinue to play out, and that they create a unique opportunity for IBM.\n And because of the way we have managed the company during the\n\neconomic downturn, we have the flexibility to take advantage of this\n\nopportunity, and to invest for growth.\n\n  Our investments in 2010 are focused on four high-potential\n\nopportunities.\n IBM has among the broadest global footprints of any corporation or\n\ninstitution.\n We serve clients in more than 170 countries around the world, and we\n\nhave been deeply established within myriad local economies and cultures for\n\ndecades. \n\n  Our Growth Markets unit, established in 2008, is helping to\n\ncapture the highest-growth opportunities of the world 's emerging economies.\n Since 2005, these markets have expanded their contribution to IBM 's\n\ngeographic revenue by a point a year, growing at least 8 points faster than\n\nmajor markets over the last three years. \n\n  Going forward, both mature and emerging markets are building out\n\nand integrating their physical and digital infrastructures, and infusing the\n\nresulting systems with intelligence.\n More than\n\n&dollar;2 trillion in fiscal stimulus has already been earmarked by governments\n\naround the world.\n We are uniquely positioned to benefit from these large business and\n\ntechnology opportunities, and we are pursuing them aggressively in 2010. \n\n  Data is being captured today as never before both from the\n\nso-called Internet of Things ( heading toward trillions of connected objects)\n\nand from hundreds of millions of individuals using social media.\n In just three years, IP traffic is expected to total more than half a\n\nzettabyte.\n ( That 's a trillion gigabytes ( or 1 followed by 21 zeroes.) And this\n\ndata no longer consists merely of text and numbers.\n It includes rich media of all kinds, from video and audio, to images,\n\navatars, simulations and applications.\n Thirty percent of the data in the world today consists of medical\n\nimages alone. \n\n  All this information-the knowledge of the world, the flow of\n\nmarkets, the pulse of societies-can now be turned into insight through\n\nsophisticated mathematical models, also known as analytics.\n Where once we inferred, now we know.\n Where once we interpolated and extrapolated, now we can determine.\n The historical is giving way to the real-time, and even the\n\npredictive. \n\n  IBM is moving quickly to capitalize on this promise.\n We have built the industry 's premier analytics practice, with 4,000\n\nconsultants, mathematicians and researchers, as well as leading-edge software\n\ncapabilities bolstered by key acquisitions such as Cognos and SPSS.\n Our new Business Analytics and Optimization service line targets the\n\nhighest-growth opportunities by delivering integrated analytics solutions\n\nbased on the needs of specific industries. \n\n  As our planet becomes instrumented, interconnected and\n\nintelligent, the computing model is evolving to support it.\n Think of it as the industrialization of IT.\n Over the past generation, our digital infrastructures have become\n\nvery complex and inefficient, so now we're 'reimizing them through\n\nautomation, creating systems that are highly tuned to the specific workloads\n\nthey run and to new consumption and delivery models, such as clouds. \n\n  Thus, the data center is shifting from being a single physical\n\nplace to something more like the Internet, a diverse set of services fueled\n\nby IT.\n This provides far more choice and flexibility, which is of particular\n\ninterest to the many businesses and governments that want simply to consume\n\nsome services they once built, maintained and provided themselves.\n It also makes possible things that were not previously so, such as\n\nmodeling systemic risk or creating integrated healthcare records. \n\n  However, with these new possibilities come new challenges, in\n\nareas such as security.\n As a result, our clients are seeking help in architecting and\n\nbuilding a new kind of highly efficient infrastructure that is reliable and\n\nsecure, even as it integrates services from a variety of external\n\nsources.\n\n  We have invested billions of dollars in R&D and acquisitions to\n\nbuild leadership in two key dimensions of this new IT model: service\n\nmanagement software and optimized systems.\n We have also established a portfolio of cloud services that clients\n\ncan access externally from IBM or offer internally to users on their own\n\npremises.\n And because of IBM 's track record of integrating new technology\n\nparadigms like open source and the Internet into the enterprise, we have\n\nearned the trust of clients and the industry to bring reliability and\n\nsecurity to what is new.  WWe are seeing smarter systems being\n\nimplemented in every major industry and across every region of both the\n\ndeveloped and developing worlds.\n And they are creating measurable economic and societal value.\n All of these growth strategies come together in the opportunity we\n\ncall \" smarter planet.\" This is not a metaphor.\n It describes the infusion of intelligence into the way the world\n\nactually works, the way that almost anything-any person, any object, any\n\nprocess or any service, for any organization, large or small, can now become\n\ndigitally aware, networked and intelligent.\n This means that industries, infrastructures, processes, cities and\n\nentire societies can be more productive, efficient and responsive. \n\n  We developed this agenda and strategic initiative in the summer\n\nof 2008, and we launched it that autumn at the peak of the economic crisis.\n We did so because we believed it represented a pragmatic way to\n\naddress the very problems that were transfixing the world. \n\n  After just a year, it is clear that our belief was correct.\n The idea of \" smarter systems\" is resonating with decision-makers in\n\nboth the private and public sectors.\n We are seeing these systems being implemented in every major industry\n\nand across every region of both the developed and developing worlds.\n\n\n  In a study of 439 cities, those that employ smarter\n\ntransportation solutions-including ramp metering, signal coordination and\n\nincident management-reduced travel delays on average by more than 700,000\n\nhours annually. \n\n  Eight hospitals and 470 primary care clinics in Spain implemented\n\nsmarter healthcare systems across their facilities and improved clinical\n\nresults and operational efficiency by up to 10 percent. \n\n  Banks and other financial services organizations around the world\n\nare achieving new levels of risk control, efficiency and customer service.\n For instance, payment processing costs at the Bank of Russia have\n\nbeen reduced by 95 percent.\n And CLS Bank now handles most of the world 's currency exchange\n\ntransactions, securely eliminating the risk from trades worth\n\n&dollar;3.5 trillion per day, and growing. \n\n  Four leading retailers have reduced supply chain costs by up to\n\n30 percent, reduced inventory levels by up to 25 percent, and increased sales\n\nup to 10 percent.\n They'v 'veone so by analyzing customer buying behaviors, aligning\n\nmerchandising assortments with demand and building end-to-end visibility\n\nacross their entire supply chain. \n\n  This list could go on.\n We are quantifying the outcomes of hundreds and hundreds of smarter\n\nsystems, and this measurable value gives leaders everywhere the confidence to\n\ntry something new. \n\n  The opportunity to make our planet smarter is both real and\n\ninspiring.\n It has excited forward-thinking leaders in industry, government and\n\nacross civil society in both mature and growth markets.\n Encouragingly, but not surprisingly, it has also energized IBMers.\n Over nearly a century, IBM 's greatest achievements have arisen from\n\nour distinctive culture and values. \n\n  This is why, despite the current economic climate, I am\n\noptimistic about IBM 's prospects to lead the era we are now entering.\n Underneath the surface turmoil, this moment presents a rich and\n\ntransformational opportunity.\n Everywhere around the world, people are eager for change.\n And every day, more and more forward-thinking leaders are creating\n\ntangible outcomes and benefits, making their parts of our planet smarter.\n Like IBMers, they recognize that we cannot wait, cannot let this\n\nmoment pass.\n They know the time to act is now.\n\n\n  Let me close by expressing my pride in the 400,000 women and men\n\nof the global IBM team who have brought us to this point.\n And let me express my gratitude to you, our shareholders, for your\n\nunwavering support.\n I hope that you are pleased with how your company is performing and\n\nevolving.\n And I trust that you share our excitement about the role we can play\n\nin what promises to be a new epoch for our industry, for business and for our\n\nplanet.

{"text": "<P>  Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data.\n used to\n\nevaluate clustering quality and the  control strategy  used to\n\nsearch the space of clusterings.\n Ideally, the search strategy should consistently construct clusterings\n\nof high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well.\n Given the combinatorial complexity of the general clustering problem,\n\na search strategy cannot be both computationally inexpensive and give any\n\nguarantee about the quality of discovered clusterings across a diverse set of\n\ndomains and objective functions.\n However, we can partition the search so that an initial clustering is\n\ninexpensively constructed, followed by iterative optimization procedures that\n\ncontinue to search in background for improved clusterings.\n This allows an analyst to get an early indication of the possible\n\npresence and form of structure in data, but search can continue as long as it\n\nseems worthwhile.\n This seems to be a primary motivation behind the design of systems\n\nsuch as AUTOCLASS [ Cheeseman, Kelly, Self, Stutz, Taylor & Freeman, 1988]\n\nand SNOB [ Wallace & Dowe, 1994].\n\n<P>  This paper describes and evaluates three strategies for iterative\n\noptimization, one inspired by the iterative ` seed' selection strategy of\n\nCLUSTER/2 [ Michalski & Stepp, 1983a; 1983b], one is a common form of\n\noptimization that iteratively reclassifies single observations, and a third\n\nmethod appears novel in the clustering literature.\n This latter strategy was inspired, in part, by macro-learning\n\nstrategies [ Iba, 1989] - - collections of observations are reclassified\n\n en masse  , which appears to mitigate problems associated\n\nwith local maxima as measured by the objective function.\n For evaluation purposes, we couple these strategies with a simple,\n\ninexpensive procedure used by COBWEB [ Fisher, 1987a; 1987b] and a system by\n\nAnderson and Matessa [ Anderson & Matessa, 1991], which constructs an initial\n\nhierarchical clustering.\n These iterative optimization strategies, however, can be paired with\n\nother methods for constructing initial clusterings.\n\n<P>  Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by analysts -\n\n- often according to task-specific criteria.\n Several authors [ Fisher, 1987a; 1987b; Cheeseman et al., 1988;\n\nAnderson & Matessa, 1991] have abstracted these criteria into a generic\n\nperformance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over\n\ncompleted patterns can be used to ` externally' judge the utility of a\n\nclustering.\n In each of these systems, the objective function has been selected\n\nwith this performance task in mind.\n Given this performance task we adapt resampling-based pruning\n\nstrategies used by supervised learning systems to the task of simplifying\n\nhierarchical clusterings, thus easying post-clustering analysis.\n Experimental evidence suggests that hierarchical clusterings can be\n\ngreatly simplified with no increase in pattern-completion error rate.\n\n<P>  Our experiments with clustering simplification suggest `\n\nexternal' criteria of simplicity and classification cost, in addition to\n\npattern-completion error rate, for judging the relative merits of differing\n\nobjective functions in clustering.\n We suggest several objective functions that are adaptations of\n\nselection measures used in supervised, decision-tree induction, which may do\n\nwell on the dimensions of simplicity and error rate.\n\n<P>  Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning that partitions\n\nobservations into classes or clusters ( collectively, called a clustering).\n An objective function or quality measure guides this search, ideally\n\nfor a clustering that is optimal as measured by the objective function.\n A hierarchical-clustering system creates a tree-structured\n\nclustering, where sibling clusters partition the observations covered by\n\ntheir common parent.\n\n\nhierarchical sorting  , for creating hierarchical clusterings.\n\n\n<P>  We assume that an observation is a vector of nominal values,\n\nalong distinct variables, .\n [ Gluck & Corter, 1985;\n\nCorter & Gluck, 1992], and/or variants have been used extensively by a system\n\nknown as COBWEB [ Fisher, 1987a] and many related systems [ Gennari, Langley\n\n& Fisher, 1989; McKusick & Thompson, 1990; Iba & Gennari, 1991; McKusick &\n\nLangley, 1991; Reich & Fenves, 1991; Biswas, Weinberg & Li, 1994; De Alte Da\n\nVeiga, 1994; Kilander, 1994; Ketterlin, Gancarski & Korczak, 1995].\n\n\npredictability  of variable values within ( i.e., ) relative to their\n\npredictability in the population as a whole ( i.e., ) .\n By favoring clusters that increase predictability ( i.e., ) , we also\n\nnecessarily favor clusters that increase variable value  predictiveness\n\n ( i.e., ) .\n\n<P> \n\ncohesive.\n Increases in predictability stem from the shared variable values of\n\nobservations within a cluster.\n from other\n\nclusters if many variable values are predictive of the cluster.\n High predictiveness stems from the differences in the variable values\n\nshared by members of one cluster from those shared by observations of another\n\ncluster.\n A general principle of clustering is to increase the similarity of\n\nobservations within clusters ( i.e., cohesion) and to decrease the similarity\n\nof observations across clusters ( i.e., coupling).\n\n<P> \n\n, which has been used in supervised systems that construct decision trees [\n\nMingers, 1989b; Weiss & Kulikowski, 1991].\n The Gini Index is typically intended to address the issue of how well\n\nthe values of a variable, , predict  a priori  known class\n\nlabels in a supervised context.\n addresses\n\nthe extent that a cluster predicts the values of all the variables.\n some words possibly removed from\n\nthis sentence  that most reduce a collective impurity over all\n\nvariables.\n\n<P>  is used to\n\nmeasure the quality of a partition of data, or the average category utility\n\nof clusters in the partition.\n Sections 3.5 and 5.2 note some nonoptimalities with this measure of\n\npartition quality, and suggest some alternatives.\n Nonetheless, this measure is commonly used, we will take this\n\nopportunity to note its problems, and none of the techniques that we describe\n\nis tied to this measure.\n\n\n<P>  As in COBWEB, AUTOCLASS [ Cheeseman et al., 1988], and other\n\nsystems [ Anderson & Matessa, 1991], we will assume that clusters, , are\n\ndescribed probabilistically: each variable value has an associated\n\nconditional probability, , which reflects the proportion of observations in\n\nthat exhibit the value, , along variable .\n In fact, each variable value is actually associated with the number\n\nof observations in the cluster having that value; probabilities are computed\n\n` on demand' for purposes of evaluation.\n\n<P>  Probabilistically-described clusters arranged in a tree form a\n\nhierarchical clustering known as a probabilistic categorization tree.\n Each set of sibling clusters partitions the observations covered by\n\nthe common parent.\n cluster, identical in structure to\n\nother clusters, but covering all observations and containing frequency\n\ninformation necessary to compute 's as required by category utility.\n Figure 1 gives an example of a probablistic categorization tree (\n\ni.e., a hierarchical clustering) in which each node is a cluster of\n\nobservations summarized probabilistically.\n Observations are at leaves and are described by three variables:\n\nSize, Color, and Shape.\n\n\n<P>  , which\n\nis a term adapted from a psychological task that requires subjects to perform\n\nroughly the same procedure that we describe here [ Ahn & Medin, 1989].\n Given an observation and a current partition, sorting evaluates the\n\nquality of new clusterings that result from placing the observation in each\n\nof the existing clusters, and the quality of the clustering that results from\n\ncreating a new cluster that only covers the new observation; the option that\n\nyields the highest quality score ( e.g., using PU  ) is\n\nselected.\n\n\n<P>  This procedure is easily incorporated into a recursive loop that\n\nbuilds tree-structured clusterings: given an existing hierarchical\n\nclustering, an observation is sorted relative to the top-level partition (\n\ni.e., children of the root); if an existing child of the root is chosen to\n\ninclude the observation, then the observation is sorted relative to the\n\nchildren of this node, which now serves as the root in this recursive call.\n If a leaf is reached, the tree is extended downward.\n The maximum height of the tree can be bounded, thus limiting downward\n\ngrowth to fixed depth.\n Figure 2 shows the tree of Figure 1 after two new observations have\n\nbeen added to it: one observation extends the left subtree downward, while\n\nthe second is made a new leaf at the deepest, existing level of the right\n\nsubtree.\n\n<P>  This sorting strategy is identical to that used by Anderson and\n\nMatessa [ Anderson & Matessa, 1991].\n The children of each cluster partition the observations that are\n\ncovered by their parent, though the measure,  PU  , used to\n\nguide sorting differs from that of Anderson and Matessa.\n The observations themselves are stored as singleton clusters at\n\nleaves of the tree.\n Other hierarchical-sort based strategies augment this basic procedure\n\nin a manner described in Section 3.3 [ Fisher1987a; Hadzikadic & Yun, 1989;\n\nDecaestecker1991].\n\n<P>  Hierarchical sorting quickly constructs a tree-structured\n\nclustering, but one which is typically nonoptimal.\n\n\neffects: different orderings of the observations may yield different\n\nclusterings [ Fisher, Xu & Zard, 1992].\n Thus, after an initial clustering phase, a ( possibly offline)\n\nprocess of iterative optimization seeks to uncover better clusterings.\n\n\n<P>  Michalski and Stepp 's [ Michalski & Stepp, 1983a] CLUSTER/2 seeks\n\nthe optimal K-partitioning of data.\n The first step selects K random ` seed' observations from the data.\n These seeds are ` attractors' around which the K clusters are grown\n\nfrom the remaining data.\n Since seed selection can greatly impact clustering quality, CLUSTER/2\n\nselects K new seeds that are ` centroids' of the K initial clusters.\n Clustering is repeated with these new seeds.\n This process iterates until there is no further improvement in the\n\nquality of generated clusterings.\n\n<P>  Ordering effects in sorting are related to effects that arise due\n\nto differing fixed-K seed selections: the initial observations in an ordering\n\nestablish initial clusters that ` attract' the remaining observations.\n In general, sorting performs better if the initial observations are\n\nfrom diverse areas of the observation-description space, since this\n\nfacilitates the establishment of initial clusters that reflect these\n\ndifferent areas.\n Fisher, Xu, and Zard [ 1992] showed that ordering data so that\n\nconsecutive observations were dissimilar based on Euclidean distance led to\n\ngood clusterings.\n .\n [ 1994] adapted this technique in their ITERATE system with similar\n\nresults.\n score described\n\npreviously.\n\n<P>  This procedure presumes that observations that appear dissimilar\n\nby Euclidean distance tend to be placed in different clusters using the\n\nobjective function.\n Taking the lead from CLUSTER/2, a measure-independent idea first\n\nsorts using a random data ordering, then extracts a biased ` dissimilarity'\n\nordering from the hierarchical clustering, and sorts again.\n The function of Table 1 outlines the reordering procedure.\n It recursively extracts a list of observations from the most probable\n\n( i.e., largest) cluster to the least probable, and then merges ( i.e.,\n\ninterleaves) these lists, before exiting each recursive call - - at each\n\nstep, an element from the most probable cluster is placed first, followed by\n\nan element of the second most probable, and so forth.\n Whatever measure guides clustering, observations in differing\n\nclusters have been judged dissimilar by the measure.\n Thus, this measure-independent procedure returns a measure-dependent\n\ndissimilarity ordering by placing observations from different clusters\n\nback-to-back.\n\n\n \n\n<P>  A common and long-known form of iterative optimization moves\n\nsingle observations from cluster to cluster in search of a better clustering\n\n[ Duda & Hart, 1973].\n The basic strategy has been used in one form or another by numerous\n\nsort-based algorithms as well [ Fisher et al., 1992].\n [ Biswas,\n\nWeinberg, Yang & Koller, 1991] is simple: observations in a single-level\n\nclustering are ` removed' from their original cluster and resorted relative\n\nto the clustering.\n If a cluster contains only one observation, then the cluster is `\n\nremoved' and its single observation is resorted.\n This process continues until two consecutive iterations yield the\n\nsame clustering.\n\n<P>  The ISODATA algorithm [ Duda & Hart, 1973] determines a target\n\ncluster for each observation, but does not actually change the clustering\n\nuntil targets for all observations have been determined; at this point, all\n\nobservations are moved to their targets, thus altering the clustering.\n We limit ourselves to a sequential version, also described by Duda\n\nand Hart [ 1973], that moves each observation as its target is identified\n\nthrough sorting.\n\n<P>  This strategy is conceptually simple, but is limited in its\n\nability to overcome local maxima - - the reclassification of a particular\n\nobservation may be in the true direction of a better clustering, but it may\n\nnot be perceived as such when the objective function is applied to the\n\nclustering that results from resorting the single observation.\n\n<P>  An iterative optimization strategy that appears novel in the\n\nclustering literature is iterative hierarchical redistribution.\n This strategy is rationalized relative to single-observation\n\niterative redistribution: even though moving a set of observations from one\n\ncluster to another may lead to a better clustering, the movement of any\n\nsingle observation may initially reduce clustering quality, thus preventing\n\nthe eventual discovery of the better clustering.\n In response, hierarchical redistribution considers the movement of\n\nobservation sets, represented by existing clusters in a hierarchical\n\nclustering.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4394cc23-9cc1-4270-9127-f29a3143b677", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.737529+00:00"}
{"text": "This paper is based on a review of the literature about controlled\n\nexperiments in research on knowledge acquisition.\n The review was carried out to help the author make decisions about the\n\ndesign of his own experiment comparing two knowledge-acquisition methods.\n The paper looks critically at six experiments reported in the\n\nliterature, and proposes a framework within which such empirical work can be\n\nviewed.\n It concludes that some of the apparent difficulties can be resolved,\n\nand that controlled experiments can be a useful way of discovering the\n\nrelationships at work in a knowledge-acquisition project.\n\n\n  Case studies and benchmarks have been used widely in research on\n\nknowledge-based systems.\n For example, in a case study, Michalski and Chilausky [ 1]\n\ninvestigated the effect of the acquisition method in a single domain on the\n\neffort needed to acquire the knowledge and on the diagnostic accuracy of the\n\nresulting knowledge bases.\n In a benchmark, Quinlan [ 21 used several ease bases as input to\n\ndifferent induction algorithms, and observed the effect of these variables on\n\nthe diagnostic accuracy of the induced knowledge bases.\n\n  But there is a growing awareness [ 3] that controlled experiments\n\ncan help advance understanding of how the knowledge source, representation,\n\nacquisition method, domain, and engineer affect the effort needed to build a\n\nknowledge base and the quality of its performance.\n Burton and Shadbolt [ 4, p.11] argue strongly in favor of controlled\n\nexperimentation:\n\n  Although one can get useful practical information from case\n\nstudies, there will always be many factors unique to any particular\n\nknowledge-elicitation session.\n\n\n  Indeed, researchers such as Burton et al. [ 5], Lundell [ 6],\n\nStevenson et al. [ 7], Deffner and Ahrens [ 8], Adelman [ 3], and Agarwal and\n\nTanniru [ 9] have used methods from experimental psychology to explore\n\nresearch questions in knowledge acquisition.\n\n  The author 's interest in the subject arose from his own need to\n\ncompare two knowledge-acquisition methods 1 in terms of the effort they\n\ndemand from a domain expert, and the accuracy of their outcomes.\n The controlled experiment seemed the ideal way to do the\n\ninvestigation, so a search was made of previous uses of this of knowledge\n\nacquisition.\n It is evident that not many researchers have used controlled\n\nexperiments for this purpose.\n However, the few that appear in the literature do contain lessons\n\nfrom which the author 's own design was able to benefit.\n These lessons, and their influence on the author 's design, are\n\ndiscussed in this paper.\n\n\n  This section discusses six experiments reported in the\n\nknowledge-acquisition literature.\n\n\n  Proposing hypotheses based on Anderson 's theory of skill\n\nacquisition [ 11], Lundell argues [ 6] that while novices store their\n\nexpertise in declarative memory, or at the conscious level, experts do so in\n\nprocedural memory, or at the tacit level.\n Lundell further argues that it ought to be easier to elicit rules\n\nfrom novices than from experts, and that it ought to be easier to obtain\n\ntypical examples ( or what he calls  ? prototypes\") from experts than\n\nfrom novices.\n\n  In addition, Lundell conjectures that an artificial neural\n\nnetwork ( built using prototypes and exemplars obtained from an expert) ought\n\nto have greater diagnostic accuracy than a similar knowledge base derived\n\nfrom exemplars and prototypes that have been elicited from novices.\n Conversely, a set of rules elicited directly from a novice ought to\n\nhave a higher diagnostic accuracy than a set elicited directly from an\n\nexpert.\n\n \n\nhypothesis asserts that if, for example, a rule-elicitation method is used,\n\nit will elicit primarily knowledge stored as rules in the mind of the expert.\n ? elicitational\n\ncongruence? hypotheses involve the following independent\n\nvariables:\n\n  *Elicitation method.*Expert 's level of expertise.*Knowledge\n\nrepresentation in the knowledge base./p>\n\n  These variables are all controllable in an experiment.\n The dependent variable, which, Lundell argues, is a function of the\n\nvariables listed above, is diagnostic accuracy of the knowledge base built\n\nusing the knowledge elicited from a subject.\n To test his hypotheses, Lundell had to vary the controllable\n\nvariables in turn, and record the effects on diagnostic accuracy.\n Taking several observations for each setting of each controllable\n\nvariable allowed him to increase the reliability of his results.\n Of course, the subjects themselves are also variable ( see, e.g., [\n\n3, 12]).\n\n  Lundell 's experiment is essentially a two-group design, in which\n\neach subject fills in four different types of questionnaire.\n It used a random presentation order in an attempt at eliminating\n\nsequence effects.\n\n  Two of Lundell 's questionnaires were aimed at eliciting rules\n\ndirectly.\n questionnaire, and\n\nthe other the  ? decomposed rule? questionnaire.\n These two complemented each other in his subsequent creation of rule\n\nbases.\n\n  The two other questionnaires were aimed at examples, from which\n\nknowledge could be derived by some kind of machine learning.\n One of these questionnaires elicited a set of typical example or\n\ncases; this one he called the  ? prototype elicitation?\n\nquestionnaire.\n ? exemplar\n\nquestionnaire,? consisted of a randomly generated set of undiagnosed\n\nhypothetical cases for the subjects to diagnose.\n\n  Using these questionnaires for knowledge acquisition appears to\n\nimpair the external validity of Lundell 's experiment.\n The antecedents and the consequents are given, whereas in practice it\n\nseems more usual to have to be elicited from the knowledge source by various\n\nmethods.\n The considerable amount of knowledge acquisition which clearly went\n\ninto the preparation of these questionnaires deserves to be acknowledged\n\nopenly.\n Moreover, questionnaires are rarely used to acquire knowledge for\n\nknowledge-based systems ( see, e.g., [ 13]).\n\n  Lundell used the completed questionnaires to build a number of\n\nexpert systems, but little is said in his dissertation about this process.\n And without any reassurance to the contrary, his readers are left\n\nwondering about the scope for introduction of errors at this stage.\n Still, perhaps this criticism is a bit unfair, because the graphic\n\nrepresentation on his questionnaires seems capable of being easily\n\ntransformed into production rules.\n In the case of his connectionist networks, it appears obvious that\n\nthe exemplar and prototype data were simply coded as examples and used to\n\ntrain the networks in the task.\n\n  Lundell 's subjects emerged from his training with a range of\n\nlevels of expertise in the diagnostic task.\n Some had become good at it, and others had learned to a lesser\n\nextent.\n Lundell classified his newly trained subjects as either skilled or\n\nunskilled.\n He set his criterion at the median test score, so that half the\n\nsubjects are  ? unskilled? and the others  ?\n\nskilled.? It appears to be an arbitrary distinction with little basis\n\nin theory and little rationale, save that of balancing the sizes of the two\n\ngroups.\n\n  After basing his initial arguments on the theory that experts'\n\nskills reside at a tacit level while novices' skills are represented\n\nconsciously, Lundell appears to make little use of this representational\n\ndifferential that would be expected to exist between his skilled group and\n\nhis unskilled one.\n\n  Perhaps an improvement would have been to use an adaptive\n\nquestionnaire to gather the same type of data.\n Under this approach, subjects would interact w computer program that\n\nasks questions based on answers already given.\n By doing this, he would have introduced some of the flexibility\n\ncharacteristic of real-world knowledge acquisition, while providing\n\nsystematic and consistent recording of data.\n\n  By creating his own experts in a domain of his own making,\n\nLundell may have sacrificed external validity, but at the same time he gained\n\na ready-made set of test cases against which both the experts themselves and\n\nthe elicited knowledge bases could be evaluated.\n He also limited the scope of the task to a size amenable to analysis\n\nand experimental control.\n\n\n  Stevenson et al. [ 7] also did an experiment to test a hypothesis\n\nimplied by Anderson 's ACT* ( adaptive control of thought) theory [ 11].\n Their hypothesis was that their own method of knowledge acquisition\n\nwould be more effective than  ? traditional? methods.\n They argue that it is wrong to assume that analysis of thinking-aloud\n\nprotocols accurately unearths the knowledge contained in an expert 's\n\nautomatic productions.\n What thinking aloud is more likely to do, they argue, is to slow down\n\nand even distort the expert 's actions.\n They argue that it is more effective to let the expert perform his\n\ntask undisturbed except for the scrutiny of a videotape camera and recorder.\n At some later time, the expert can explain his actions while watching\n\nthe videotape.\n These explanations can be used to generate production rules.\n ? evaluation\n\ntechnique.\"\n\n  The experiment of Stevenson et al. tested their hypothesis by\n\nvarying the acquisition-method treatments to which subjects were exposed.\n They used a two-group repeated-measures design, although one group (\n\nthe experts) was very small ( two subjects) compared with the other group (\n\neight subjects).\n All subjects received all treatments, but in the same order ( there\n\nwas no attempt to correct for sequence effects by counterbalancing).\n But time ( more than a day) was allowed between treatments, perhaps\n\nto allow the attenuation of any carry-over effects.\n\n  Stevenson et al. appear not to have taken the analysis of the\n\ndata as far as Lundell did.\n They did not measure the diagnostic accuracy of derived knowledge\n\nbases.\n They did, however, employ a more qualitative approach than Lundell 's\n\nbald statistical one.\n They examined the differences between the kinds of constructs that\n\nthe experts produced and those that the novices produced.\n\n  But although Stevenson et al. assert that thinking aloud may be\n\nless effective than their evaluation technique, they fail to support this\n\nempirically.\n Or, more precisely, they appear not to have designed their experiment\n\nto test this.\n\n\n  Deffner and Ahrens [ 8] were not comparing knowledge-acquisition\n\nmethods; they were simply evaluating the single method embodied in a tool of\n\ntheirs.\n This method involves having a domain expert enter language and, as a\n\nsecond stage, refine any ill-defined quantifiers used in the rules.\n According to [ 8], deferring the refinement solves the problem of\n\nwhen they are interrupted and asked to be more precisse about\n\nquantifiers.\n\n  Like Lundell, Deffoer and Ahrens used an artificial domain and\n\ncreated experts in it by training their twenty-two subjects.\n The domain is nutritional prediction in a simulation of a person to\n\nbe fed from a menu.\n During training, the subjects are free to display their tendency to\n\nexplore the domain.\n This tendency is observed by tracing each subject 's interactions with\n\nthe training software.\n\n  Although apparently not so by design, Ahrens' experiment is a\n\ntwo-group one.\n cluster analysis of\n\nsome of the training interaction data.\n Both groups received the same treatment ( elicitation method), but\n\nthey also had what Deffner and Ahrens assume to be two different levels of\n\nexpertise.\n One dependent variable is the accuracy of the generated knowledge\n\nbase, and this is measured by testing the rules on the simulation.\n Other dependent variables are the number of rules elicited and the\n\naverage number of attributes per rule.\n\n  Deffner and Ahrens do not say how many of their subjects fall\n\ninto each group.\n ? fall clearly\n\ninto one of the two groups.? They concede that their tool  ?\n\nmay at first sight appear not to be very practical? [ 2, p.359], and\n\ntry to remedy this lack of external validity by suggesting where the use of\n\nthe tool might fit in a series of knowledge-acquisition stages.\n\n\n  Whereas Lundell [ 6] and Stevenson et al. [ 7] were testing\n\nhypotheses, Burton et al. [ 5] wanted to determine the relative efficacies\n\nand efficiencies of different knowledge-elicitation techniques.\n They wanted to be able to predict which methods would be most\n\nappropriate for which circumstances, so that builders of knowledge-based\n\nsystems would have some empirical basis for their choices.\n\n  Burton et al. also stopped short of building knowledge bases, and\n\ntherefore did not reach diagnostic accuracy.\n However, they did perform other kinds of evaluation on the elicited\n\nknowledge, which they coded as  ? pseudo-English production\n\nrules.? In a subsequent experiment, these rules were each rated by\n\nthe experts on a four-point scale ranging from true to false.\n Thus, they were able to compare ( at least for some of their data)\n\nthe overall quality of rules resulting from each elicitation technique.\n\n  In their experiment, Burton et al. had as independent variables\n\nthe elicitation method and the expert 's personality.\n They tried to keep the knowledge representation constant.\n Their dependent variables were the amount of knowledge elicited per\n\nunit time, and the quality of elicited rules.\n\n  They also made the distinction between procedural and\n\ndeclarative knowledge.\n Indeed, they assert that two of their methods ( protocol analysis\n\nand formal interview) are likely to elicit procedural knowledge, white the\n\nothers ( card sort and laddered grid) are likely to elicit dectanttive\n\nknowledge.\n But they were forced to conclude that their results did not support\n\nthis assertion.\n\n  Although, like Lundell, they used students as subjects.\n Burton et at. did not create instant experts.\n 'l'hus, their claim of expertise is more credible, especially in the\n\nlight of Anderson-s assertion [ It] that it takes a long period of practice\n\nto create an expert.\n On the other hand, Burton et at.\n offer little proof of the subjects' expertise.\n Burton 's subjects were not tested for skill level as Lundell 's\n\nsubjects were.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f491e111-61b0-4cc7-a792-30282e713dd6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.739024+00:00"}
{"text": "<P>  Cosmic rays may cause soft fails in electronic logic or memory.\n The IBM Journal of Research and Development, Volume 40, No.\n 1, discussed this complex event in detail.\n In order to predict electronic fail rates from cosmic particles, it is\n\nnecessary to know the local cosmic ray flux.\n This paper reviews the penetration of cosmic rays through the earth 's\n\natmosphere, and the parameters which affect the terrestrial flux.\n The final particle flux is shown to vary mainly with the site 's\n\ngeomagnetic coordinates and its altitude.\n The paper describes in detail the quantitative cosmic flux at one\n\ndatum ( New York City) and then tabulates in an appendix the relative level\n\nat other major cities of the world. </P>\n\n\n  Cosmic rays were first discovered because of the dogged curiosity\n\nof one man to explain a minor scientific irritation.\n The study of radioactive materials in the period from 1898 to 1912\n\nwas of widespread interest because this field offered direct insight into the\n\nnature of the atom, whose structure was still unknown.\n Electrometers were often used to measure the very small flux of\n\nparticles coming from radioactive materials.\n ( An electrometer consists of two thin ribbons of metal suspended in\n\na vacuum bulb, which diverge when charge is present.)\n In use, electrometer readings had to be corrected for \" leakage,\"\n\nwhich was dependent on the electrometer size and proportional to time, but\n\nremarkably was not dependent on the amount of charge on the electrometer\n\nfoils.\n This leakage led to speculation about possible undiscovered\n\nradioactive contamination, or a flux of new invisible ether particles.\n Victor Hess studied this phenomenon by taking electrometers onto\n\nlakes where there should have been less contamination ( no change in leakage)\n\nand into caves ( leakage disappeared).\n Finally, in 1912, he brilliantly solved the problem by lifting two\n\nion chambers in balloons to altitudes of 6 km ( Figure 1) [ 1, 2].\n He showed that there was indeed a flux of particles, and that it came\n\nfrom the sky with an intensity which increased with altitude ( he was awarded\n\nthe 1936 Nobel Prize for this work).\n His work was immediately followed by more detailed studies such as\n\nthat of Kolhorster, who showed that the particle flux increased very rapidly\n\nwith altitude, with a 10X increase at only 10 km.\n Cosmic rays became the source of wild speculation for the next twenty\n\nyears because of their exponential increase in flux with height.\n Finally, Pfotzer showed in 1936 that the flux did not continue to\n\nincrease but reached a peak at about 15 km, after which it diminished rapidly\n\n[ 3] [ Figure l(c)].\n All of this early work is directly related to the prediction of\n\nintegrated circuit ( IC) soft fails at terrestrial altitudes and at airplane\n\naltitudes. \n\n  Because of the wide speculation about the nature of cosmic rays (\n\na name introduced by the popular press about 1914), there is no single\n\nscientific definition of the phrase, only the popular description: Things\n\nwhich rain down from the heaven and are not wet.\n The scientific literature has adopted three variations on the phrase:\n\nprimary cosmic rays, the initial particle flux external to the earth 's\n\natmosphere; cascade cosmic rays, the intermediate flux within the atmosphere;\n\nand sea-level cosmic rays, the final terrestrial flux of particles. \n\n\n  This paper evaluates the terrestrial cosmic ray flux at various\n\ncities to facilitate the prediction of cosmic-rayinduced electronic soft\n\nfails [ 4].\n The cosmic particles which cause soft fails fall into the class of\n\nparticles called hadrons, which interact with the strong interaction ( also\n\ncalled the nuclear force), specifically neutrons, protons, and pions.\n Experimental values of the flux of all of these particles have never\n\nbeen measured for any single terrestrial site.\n Therefore, scattered measurements taken over 50 years must be\n\ncombined with theoretical estimates of variability to obtain a single\n\nbenchmark cosmic sealevel flux, the cosmic flux datum, which was arbitrarily\n\nchosen to be that at New York City.\n Other experiments and theoretical calculations will scale this datum\n\nflux to other terrestrial cities.\n The topics of this paper are presented in the following order:\n 1.External particle flux-A discussion of the external incident cosmic\n\nray particle flux into the earth 's outer atmosphere, and how it changes with\n\ntime. \n\n  2.Cascades in the atmosphere-None of these external incident\n\nparticles survive to reach the earth 's surface because of the density of the\n\natmosphere and the strength of the strong interaction.\n Each incident particle creates a cascade of secondary particles,\n\nwhich in turn creates further cascades.\n The details of the cascades are complicated because many high-energy\n\nparticles decay spontaneously, with half-lives of less than a nanosecond.\n A cascade calculation is used which gives flux spectra for all\n\nsignificant particles ( including all hadrons) in the lower atmosphere.\n This calculation generates the shapes of the sea-level particle flux\n\nspectra ( differential flux versus particle energy).\n These shapes are then normalized using the available experimental\n\ndata. \n\n  3. Altitude corrections-The results of the above particle cascade\n\ncalculations are used to obtain snapshots of the cascades at various\n\naltitudes in order to establish scaling rules which correct experimental flux\n\nmeasurements taken at various terrestrial altitudes to a common sea-level\n\ndatum. \n\n  4. Geomagnetic corrections The earth 's magnetic field deflects\n\ncosmic rays and significantly modifies the terrestrial flux.\n Calculations of these terrestrial variations are used to normalize\n\ncosmic flux measurements taken at various geographic locations to equivalent\n\nfluxes at New York City. \n\n  5.NYC sea-level flux datum- The above steps establish the New\n\nYork City sea-level flux datum, with experimental measurements taken at\n\ndifferent locations and at different altitudes being normalized to a common\n\npoint.\n No correction for solar cycle is made because the scatter of data is\n\nmuch larger than the effects of the solar cycle. \n\n  6.Flux intensities for cities The cosmic ray flux at many other\n\ncities is evaluated on the basis of their latitude, longitude, and altitude.\n An appendix tabulates the results for many cities with populations\n\nabove 500 000 or isolated sites with extensive electronic systems ( e.g.,\n\nKinshasa, Zaire, or Leadville, Colorado). \n\n\n  There are two sources of primary cosmic ray particles: First,\n\nthere is a flux of very energetic particles from distant sources in the\n\ngalaxy.\n There is also the flood of low-energy particles called the solar\n\nwind, which disappears during the period of the quiet sun, and then builds\n\ninto a torrential storm of particles during an active sun period.\n\n\n\n  The galactic cosmic rays are of debatable origin, and there are\n\nno theoretical estimates of the primary flux.\n Some have energies beyond 10^sup 23^ eV, so exotic scenarios have\n\nbeen proposed for their origin, such as being accelerated by stellar flares,\n\nsupernova explosions, pulsar spin-offs, or from the explosions of nascent\n\ngalactic nuclei.\n The flux density of primary cosmic rays in the galaxy is very large,\n\nabout 100 000/m^sup 2^-s.\n The energy density of cosmic rays is very high, more than I MeV/m^sup\n\n3^, so it is assumed that they must originate within our galaxy or else the\n\nmass/energy balance of cosmology would be inconsistent with current theory.\n Because our galaxy is spinning, it is saturated with a magnetic field\n\nof several microGauss.\n The cosmic rays interact with this field so that, typically, they\n\ncontinuously spiral during their lifetime with a spiral diameter of a\n\nfraction of the galactic diameter.\n It is because of this vast spiraling trajectory that a local observer\n\nwithin the galaxy would detect that the galactic cosmic rays are isotropic\n\nand do not come from particular sources. \n\n  Particle detectors in satellites have determined that the primary\n\nlow-energy cosmic ray particles consist of 92% protons and 6% alpha\n\nparticles, with the remainder being heavy nuclei ( Figure 2).\n There are no free neutrons in the external galactic flux because\n\nneutrons are unstable unless bound in a nucleus and have an 11-minute half\n\nlife as free particles.\n The flux of higher-energy particles shown in Figure 2 has been\n\nestimated from various kinds of experiments: ( a) the flux variation of\n\nparticles through different strengths of the earth 's geomagnetic field; ( b)\n\ndata from large-particle spectrometers flown in balloons to altitudes of 100\n\nkm; ( c) measurements of the penetration of hadron cascades into the earth (\n\nmarked Indirect in Figure 2); and ( d) the analysis of the very large\n\nindividual showers with 10^sup 8^ particles which spread over a hundred\n\nkilometers at sea level ( all from a single incident particle!).\n Accurate spectrometers in satellites such as CREDE-II have identified\n\nthe individual elements in the primary flux, and typical data are shown in\n\nFigure 2(b). \n\n  These incident particles have such high energies that the\n\nparticles have deBroglie wavelengths smaller than a proton diameter ( or,\n\nmore explicitly, smaller than the interaction distance of the strong\n\ninteraction).\n Further, their energy is far greater than that of nuclear binding\n\nenergies.\n This means that when a cosmic ray alpha particle hits an atmospheric\n\nnucleus, the alpha particle need not be considered as a He nucleus, but can\n\nbe treated as independent particles, two protons and two neutrons, with each\n\none interacting independently with any atmospheric nucleus.\n Therefore, from the standpoint of its interaction with the\n\natmosphere, we can simplify the primary particle flux distributions of Figure\n\n2 by assuming that the incident flux is just 71% protons and 29% neutrons.\n This assumption, along with corrected energy/flux curves for just two\n\nsets of particles, greatly simplifies the calculation of the atmospheric\n\ncascades.\n Calculations of cosmic ray particle trajectories in the earth 's\n\nmagnetic field indicate that initial energies above 1 GeV are necessary for\n\npenetration to the earth 's surface ( see [ 7-16]).\n Precise satellite measurements show that the incident flux of cosmic\n\nrays with energies above 1 GeV is about 1600/m^sup 2^-s at the edge of the\n\nexosphere with isotropic trajectories [ 17]. \n\n\n  A second source of primary cosmic rays is the sun.\n During the quiet sun period there are essentially no energetic\n\nparticles in the solar wind which can reach sea level on earth because of the\n\nlow energies of the particles.\n In the active sun period, the solar wind increases by factors of the\n\norder of 10^sup 6^, making it far denser than the galactic particle flux.\n The sun has a variable cycle which ranges from 9 to 12 years; Table 1\n\nshows the years of the most recent cycle nodes.\n During the previous quiet sun period, 1985-1986, satellite detectors\n\nindicated that there were effectively no energetic particles in the solar\n\nwind which could penetrate to sea level on earth ( i.e., with energies\n\ngreater than 1 GeV). \n\n  The simplest evidence that solar particles do not induce\n\nsea-level cascades is that there is only a small diurnal change.\n The maximum diurnal effect is estimated at less than 1%; see Figure\n\n3, which indeed shows minima occurring every day at local midnight.\n During periods of a large solar flare ( which might last a few days),\n\nthere is a small chance that the earth might pass through the narrow beam of\n\nparticles from the flare, and the total intensity of cosmic rays at the\n\nearth 's surface might double for a few hours.\n\n\n  However, there is a more important aspect to the solar cycle than\n\nthe increased particle flux.\n The active sun with its large solar wind creates a large distortion\n\nof the magnetic field about the earth ( the magnetosphere), which increases\n\nthe earth 's shielding against intragalactic cosmic rays.\n This leads to a net reduction of the sea-level cosmic rays during the\n\nperiod of the active sun.\n In the active sun of 1989-1991, which was the most intense solar\n\nactivity ever recorded, the sea-level intensity of cosmic rays actually\n\ndecreased by about 30%.\n Thus, the active sun greatly intensifies the solar wind, and the\n\nexternal particle flux increases, but the earth 's distant magnetic field also\n\nincreases.\n The final result of this complex interaction is that the terrestrial\n\nsea-level flux of cosmic particles decreases during the active sun, except\n\nfor the few hours during the most spectacular solar flares ( Figure 4). \n\n  Figure 4 is also a good representation of how the terrestrial\n\nflux which causes soft fails changes with the solar cycle.\n It includes all hadrons, and also has a significant contribution from\n\nmuon capture processes ( described later).\n It shows that the solar cycle is a perturbation of the general\n\nterrestrial flux, amounting to, at most, a 30% reduction during the most\n\nactive solar periods.\n The data in Figure 4 constitute the longest continuous record of\n\ncosmic rays [ 19-21].\n The figure shows the general inverse correlation between solar\n\nactivity and terrestrial cosmic rays, but the details of the two phenomena\n\nhave only partial relationships.\n This is because the sunspots, and their corresponding solar flares,\n\nusually distort the solar magnetosphere only in specific directions, and the\n\neffect on the earth depends on whether the earth is in that sector. \n\n  Solar flares may also send a particularly intense stream of\n\nparticles into the solar wind, but these particle streams are usually of such\n\nlow energy that they are not detected at sea level.\n During the period from 1956 to 1972 ( 17 years) there were 61 solar\n\nevents which caused particle bursts at satellite altitudes.\n Of these, only 18 were simultaneously detected at sea-level particle\n\ndetector stations, with an average change of flux of about 10% for a period\n\nof about a day ( [ 17], p. ( 6-20/21).\n More typical is a decrease in particle flux due to increased\n\nintensity of the magnetosphere caused by the solar event.\n Typical sea-level particle flux changes are shown in Figure 5, in\n\nwhich a narrow 20% dip is due to a solar flare event.\n This type of decrease is called a Forbush decrease, after the\n\nscientist who first related the decrease to solar flares [ 22]. \n\n  Details of the variation of the primary galactic particle flux\n\nwith the solar cycle have been measured, and above I GeV there are almost no\n\nsignificant differences due to the solar cycle.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5666274e-a5ca-4618-bf0b-d01ab2997fe7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.740568+00:00"}
{"text": "Although most of the citizens of the world 's largest democracy are\n\nHindus and altogether some 685 million people identify themselves as Hindus,\n\nmany Americans probably do not know a Hindu as a friend or acquaintance.\n Yet world wide only Christianity and Islam count more adherents than\n\nHinduism. \n\n  In India, where most Hindus live, about 83 out of 100 people\n\nbelong to this ancient religion, and there are also substantial Hindu\n\npopulations in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Indonesia, and half a dozen other\n\ncountries.\n In the United States and Europe, Hindus are relatively scarce; an\n\nestimated 400,000 live in the U.S. \n\n  With few opportunities to know any Hindus or gain firsthand\n\nknowledge of their religion, many Americans rely on a jumble of impressions:\n\nbearded swamis, sacred cows, Untouchables, fakirs lying on beds of nails,\n\nMahatma Gandhi, exotic temples, idols, and so on.\n Because this religion is virtually confined to the Indian\n\nsubcontinent, Westerners have to make a special effort to understand anything\n\nabout the incredibly complex religion of Hinduism, the oldest of the major\n\nworld religions. \n\n  All the other major religions trace their history to some\n\nfounder-Buddha, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad.\n Hinduism is the exception.\n No one person can be said to be the founder of Hinduism, which began\n\nto develop more than 4500 years ago when Aryan tribes invaded the\n\nsubcontinent and brought with them their sacred writings known as the Vedas.\n Since then Hinduism has passed through a number of stages.\n In its original Vedic period Hinduism emerged as a worldly and\n\noptimistic faith, in which the faithful worshiped various gods of nature,\n\nsuch as the god of fire, the god of sky, the god of storms and war. \n\n  During the next period-the Brahmanic-the role of priests was\n\ngreatly expanded; they developed complex rituals for daily life as well as\n\nfor life 's milestones.\n Also during this period the basic concepts of caste, reincarnation,\n\nand karma appeared.\n These beliefs were found in the Vedic treatises, dated as early as\n\nthe 8th and 7th centuries B. C. and known as the Upanishads--the epitome of\n\nearly Hindu philosophy. \n\n  Gradually during this period, Hindus developed the belief that\n\nthe many gods they worshiped were really many \" faces\" of one ultimate\n\nGod(Brahman) that is also the atman ( soul) of all living things.\n In its final stage philosophical Hinduism explored ways in which the\n\natman could escape from the cycle of births, deaths, and rebirths and achieve\n\nmoksha, or liberation, into the Brahman. \n\n  Hinduism acknowledges a multitude of gods--some say 330 million-\n\nbut one should distinguish between the folk religion of the Indian masses and\n\nthe Hinduism of the educated and sophisticated elite.\n The latter see Brahman as the one God who takes form as all the other\n\ngods. \n\n  Brahman 's chief attributes are seen through the trinity of Brahma\n\nthe creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Siva the destroyer.\n In practice most Hindus tend to ignore Brahma and direct their\n\ndevotion to Vishnu and Siva along with their personal and village gods.\n\n\n  Vishnu is believed to have appeared in nine incarnations to date,\n\nincluding the popular Rama and Krishna; his tenth incarnation is expected in\n\nabout 45O,OOO years.\n ( \" Song of\n\nthe Lord\"), Hinduism 's famous epic poem. \n\n  Popular Hinduism, as practiced in India 's 575,000 villages, seems\n\nboth polytheistic and tolerant.\n Devotees often treat images of the gods in their homes and in the\n\ntemples as they would a person: they offer them food and drink, clothe them,\n\nbathe them, and tuck them into bed at night.\n Again, sophisticated Hindus view these actions as suitable for people\n\nof limited education, but they themselves believe that the gods are only\n\naspects of the one great god, Brahman. \n\n  The Western observer may be puzzled by the many sects and\n\nbranches of Hinduism, but he or she might consider how Christianity looks to\n\nan educated Hindu.\n More than a billion people identify themselves as Christians; but\n\nthey group themselves in such diverse bodies as Southern Baptists,\n\nPresbyterians, Amish, Roman Catholics, Pentecostals, Jehovah 's Witnesses,\n\nLutherans, Greek orthodox, Mormons, Anglicans, Seventh-day Adventists, Copts,\n\nQuakers, Methodists, and so on.\n And if Hindu beliefs are difficult to comprehend, so is the Christian\n\ndoctrine of the Trinity. \n\n  Many Hindus see the world and material things as not fully real;\n\nthe world is but a maya, or illusion.\n People experience misery and frustration because they seek pleasure\n\nand achievement in this world of maya, and they fail to find a fully real\n\nlife in God.\n Only through final union with God can the atman escape this human\n\ncondition.   You'd bett 'd be nice\n\n  Unlike Christianity and Islam, which teach that the individual\n\nwill survive death and attain a state of eternal bliss or deprivation,\n\nHinduism teaches that salvation may take many lives to achieve.\n If one reaches the state of union with God in this life, he or she\n\nwill remain in that union forever.\n But if a person fails to achieve salvation, he or she will be reborn\n\nuntil that goal is reached.\n The soul reaches salvation by four main paths: those of devotion,\n\nknowledge, work, and meditative exercises.\n An individual Hindu will favor one of these four paths over the other\n\nthree. \n\n  Why do the wicked seem to prosper and the good suffer? Hinduism\n\nseeks the answer in its doctrine of reincarnation, which posits that the\n\nindividual dies and is born again as another person or as an animal in an\n\nalmost endless series of lives.\n A person 's karma ( the force generated by one 's actions) determines\n\nthe nature of the atman 's next incarnations. \n\n  The evildoer may return to earth as a member of a lower caste or\n\nas a dog, a horse, or an Untouchable ( a person, who is outside the caste\n\nsystem altogether).\n The virtuous person may be assigned to a higher caste.\n Either in this life or the next all good is rewarded and all evil\n\npunished. \n\n  One consequence of belief in karma is the common attitude that\n\nthose who suffer in this life are simply getting their just deserts.\n They are suffering the consequences of their bad conduct in a\n\nprevious existence. \n\n  For some Hindus, the doctrine of karma may stem the impulse to\n\nimprove the condition of the poor and sickly.\n Following the same reasoning, one wouldn't envy the healthy,\n\npowerful, and fortunate since they are enjoying the fruits of the good they\n\naccomplished in their previous lives.\n However, most sophisticated Hindus recognize that since all forms of\n\nlife have an atman, they are sacred and deserve to be cared for no matter\n\nwhat their present condition is. \n\n  Besides reincarnation and karma, the caste system is central to\n\nHindu beliefs and customs.\n When Aryan invaders conquered the indigenous people, they created the\n\nfour castes and divided themselves into the three higher castes, while\n\nassigning the conquered people to the lowest caste. \n\n  The four castes have since been further divided into\n\napproximately 3000 subcastes.\n Hindus may not change their caste during their lifetimes, but they\n\nmay aspire to a higher caste in their next incarnation.\n Caste membership determines many aspects of daily life: choice of\n\noccupation, social status, dress, religious practices, and even eating\n\nhabits.\n Each Hindu is expected to carry out the dharma, or duties, of his or\n\nher par- ticular caste and subcaste. \n\n  At the top of the system is the Brahmin caste, the priests and\n\nintellectuals.\n Then come the Kshatriyas of the ruling and warrior caste.\n Third, the Vaisyas who engage in business and the professions.\n The lowest caste and the one that includes about three fourths of the\n\nIndian population is that of the Sudras, or laborers and farmers. \n\n  Completely outside the caste system are the Untouchables, who are\n\ndestined to carry out the most menial tasks.\n Gandhi called these outcastes harijans, or children of God, and urged\n\ncompassion toward them.\n The 1949 constitution of the Indian state declares: \" Untouchability\n\nis abolished, and its practice in any form is abolished.\"\n This official and legal position has had little effect on the life of\n\nthe Untouchables in the thousands of Indian villages.\n Nevertheless, Untouchables can now attend college and aspire to\n\nbetter jobs despite the social discrimination. \n\n  Hindu marriages are usually arranged by the parents of the bride\n\nand groom with the children 's consent.\n Of course, people marry within their own caste.\n It is not uncommon that the husband and wife have not met before the\n\nceremony.\n Astrologers choose a propitious time for the wedding ceremony, which\n\nis usually conducted by a Hindu priest in the temple.\n A Brahmin might preside at the wedding of his own son or daughter.\n\n  A man 's world\n\n  Hinduism has always emphasized the role of men in religion and\n\nsociety, and that remains true today.\n Most Hindu women are expected to find fulfillment in their relations\n\nwith their husbands and children.\n A Hindu man, on the other hand, is said to pass through four stages\n\nof life.\n As a young man, he begins his spiritual journey under the guidance of\n\na guru.\n Later he undertakes the responsibilities of marriage, a career, and\n\ncommunity service.\n Only married men may perform the major religious rites, and a Hindu\n\nis not considered fully qualified until he has sired a son. \n\n  After middle age he enters the stage of detachment from material\n\nthings and may retreat to the forests to live the life of a hermit.\n In the fourth and final stage the person finds union with God and is\n\nconsidered a holy man.\n Of course, the demands of modern life may call for some modification\n\nof the final two stages. \n\n  When a Hindu man believes death is near, he tries to travel to\n\nthe holy city of Banares to bathe in the sacred waters of the Ganges River.\n The bodies of ordinary Hindus are cremated preferably on the\n\nwaterfront of the river.\n A very few sannyasins, or holy men, are not cremated upon death;\n\nrather, their bodies are garlanded by their disciples, weighted, and dropped\n\ninto the waters.\n\n\n  For many Hindus and Westerners, Gandhi, who lived from 1869 to\n\n1948, represented the highest exemplar of a holy man in modern times.\n A deeply spiritual reformer and champion of nonviolence, Gandhi was\n\nalso influenced by the Sermon on the Mount and other non-Hindu writings.\n For his dedication to an independent India he was sentenced to prison\n\nterms totaling seven years.\n When independence from British colonial rule came in 1947, the\n\ncountry was split into predominantly Hindu India and an Islamic Pakistan.\n Millions died in the ensuing civil strife.\n Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu zealot who abhorred tolerance for\n\nMuslims. \n\n  About 110 million Muslims now live in India, and a much smaller\n\nnumber of Hindus live in Pakistan.\n Unfortunately conflict between the two great religions has not been\n\nresolved.\n Riots following the destruction of a mosque at Ayodhya in India in\n\nl992 led to an estimated l2OO deaths.\n Militant Hindus tore down a mosque built more than 45O years ago, but\n\nwhich they said was erected on the site of Rama 's birthplace. \n\n  If a few Hindus resort to violence, the majority display an\n\nattitude of tolerance and nonviolence toward all living things.\n In this spirit of celebrating the sanctity of life, the cow holds a\n\nspecial place. \n\n  For millennia the people of the subcontinent have relied on cows\n\nto pull plows, produce milk for babies, and provide dung, which in dried form\n\nserves as a major domestic fuel.\n An estimated 16O million cows roam the large cities of India as well\n\nas the villages. \n\n  At one time killing a cow was a capital offense, and even to this\n\nday no devout Hindu would ever eat beef.\n At certain times of the year the faithful honor cows by anointing\n\nthem with oil and dressing them in garlands.\n Some wealthy Hindus even endow homes for aged and tired cows.\n\n\n  Hindus believe one achieves the goal of union with Brahman\n\nthrough good living, ritual, self-control, detachment, purity, nonviolence,\n\ncharity, and compassion.\n For most, yoga occupies a paramount role in their spiritual\n\ndevelopment.\n At least a dozen types of yoga, involving posture, breath control,\n\nand meditative techniques, are practiced. \n\n  Although comprehensiveness is characteristic of Hinduism, the\n\nreligion has given birth to several other religions that could not be\n\nconfined to Hinduism 's parameters.\n For example, Buddhism was founded by a Hindu in the 6th century B.\n\nC.\n Some of the teachings of Buddha have been incorporated in Hinduism,\n\nand Buddha has been added to the list of incarnations of Vishnu.\n This reabsorption of Buddhism by Hinduism has been so successful\n\nthat, while Buddhism counts hundreds of millions of devotees in China, Japan,\n\nVietnam, and other countries, it is almost nonexistent in India. \n\n  Two much smaller religions-Jainism and Sikhism-also grew out of\n\nHinduism.\n Sikhism is relatively new-it goes back

{"text": "I took the wrong exit off the autostrada.\n I had gone too far.\n I had been waiting for the right one.\n I thought I could spot it by keeping my eye on the city in the\n\ndistance.\n I kept thinking this is not the exit, the next one, and the nest one\n\nwould not be it and so I went until I realized I was circling pretty far\n\nnorth of Florence, certainly of the historic center, and so gazing for a\n\nbright afternoon sun as if there were a direction to be found there, I turned\n\noff at an exit under a high pale blue sky and the I saw above the city a\n\ncloudy and faint white moon in the sunlit sky.\n I was somewhere on some outskirts but I managed to make my way back\n\nthinking of where the Arno must be and then there I was in the heavy bumper\n\nto bumper traffic of the Lung' Arno and I did not mind the traffic because it\n\nfelt good not to be alone. \n\n  I enjoyed the movements of the crowds along the Arno and in the\n\nstop and go traffic there was time to comfortably watch the stroll of women\n\nin their Easter finery.\n There were more than a few in tights and jeans.\n Ah, the Arno, I thought, the fair river of Dante.\n Then I thought of the lines of the grand Tuscan to the college or\n\nassembly of hypocrites, that I was born and grew up by the beautiful Arno, in\n\nthe great city.\n This I always liked when he next says and I said aloud, e son, col\n\ncorpo ch' i' ho sempre avuto.\n Now I said it aloud in English, I am in the body I have always had.\n Yes, I liked that, the hypocrites in a make believe that destroys the\n\nsoul, a world of deliberate make believe, and here 's Dante in the middle of\n\nhis life alive in the body that he has always had in the world of his make\n\nbelieve, his divine poem. \n\n  Well, that 's what came to me anyway as I passed the Ponte\n\nS.Trinita and I realized I had daydreamed too far and I had to turn way back\n\ninto the neighborhood of the American Consolute on Lungarno Vespucci to find\n\nmay to Hertz.\n I parked the car and closed it.\n I patted the right front fender.\n \" Nice horsey,\" I said.\n I had sure come to like that car.\n I took the keys and the papers and dropped them into the slot of the\n\ndrawn door shutter and I walked a bit with the strap of the overnight slung\n\nover my shoulder when I spotted a taxi. \n\n\n  I had flown open the windows of my apartment.\n It was spring in Florence.\n The street below was wholly domesticated this late Easter afternoon\n\nwith families and clans.\n Some were clearly returning from the Casnine with soccer balls and\n\nballoons or from the Boboli gardens or some with enough flowers to open a\n\nsidewalk stand or with casks of oil and wine from family gatherings in\n\ncountry homes.\n Some of the children were cranky, some wild, a few dazed.\n One little boy was pissing on a post near the entranceway of an\n\napartment house while his family was carrying on a lively, animated\n\nconversation with a group of friends in front of the building.\n I guess the poor kid couldn't wait until they were done talking which\n\nhe probably already knew would be forever.\n I felt for the kid.\n\n\n  I was living on Via Arnolfo almost across the way from the corner\n\nwhere Cimabue runs into it and only a long hemispheric block from the Ponte\n\nS. Niccolo and the Hotel Mediterraneo and the only a few blocks from the\n\nPiazza Beccaria and really no more than a twenty or twenty-five minutes by\n\nfoot from the historic center.\n Nice and well located.\n\n\n  It had been a very cold winter.\n Water pipes had burst, the Arno had frozen over and a bunch of\n\nlaughing boys and girls had managed to drive a packed car onto the ice there\n\nin the middle of the river, and old Neptune, the Great White Man of the\n\nFountain in the Piazza della Signoria, had icicles on his beard and\n\nelsewhere.\n So did old Cosimo looking on from his horse and so did his horse.\n\n\n\n  The truth is that winter I had a jock cup of icicles myself.\n I had placed my hopes for the thaw in the woman who lived above me.\n\n\n\n  I could hear her footsteps clicking through my apartment as if\n\nshe were in my apartment.\n I could hear her going into the living room, the dining room, down\n\nthe corridor, into the kitchen, the bedroom.\n Wherever she went I could hear her.\n She was caged animal in high heels on an Italian marble floor.\n There she was drawing the bath water, a fate, a destiny if I would\n\nbut seize it!\n Dash up the stairs, I tell myself.\n Ring the bell.\n She comes to the door.\n She has had barely time to wrap the bath towel about her.\n The conversation is always tentative and on her part a bit coy.\n The closing line is always the same.\n\n\n  She was wonderful.\n I would say about twenty-two or three, and I was nel mezzo del\n\ncammin, in the middle of my journey as the divine poem begins. \n\n  She was tall enough, about five eight, two or three feet short of\n\nthe length of a tiger if you take away the tiger 's tail. \n\n  She had blond hair streaked with a darker color or two that she\n\nwore short and kind of punky, and she had blue eyes kind of almond shaped and\n\napple rosy cheeks and lips that you knew you had to touch lightly with your\n\nfingers before you kissed them.\n I couldn't figure out her nationality and so I decided she was\n\nLithuanian. \n\n  Her nipples always seemed to be visible no matter what she was\n\nwearing, a blouse or a sweater or pullover or dress, no matter the material.\n The form and shape of those nipples seemed to come through no matter\n\nwhat.\n Those nipples would make a painter 's strawberry delight if she were\n\nmodeling in the nude.\n Her breasts were so beautifully shaped that she needed no bra and she\n\nwore none.\n I know because I'v 'veeen her in a skimpy yellow tank top.\n She had a tight band of a waist and a fully pledged, marvelously\n\nsinging ass, a Hymn to Paradise.\n She had rich, strong thighs and legs.\n I have seen her in white short shorts that carried a red Paris\n\nsignature on the hip and she always wore high heels.\n From time to time we would pass on the street and she would give me a\n\nkind of half smile and I would feel the beginnings of a thaw from that frozen\n\nstate I have just spoken of to a liquid one. \n\n  Although as luck would have it, for the six months that I had\n\nbeen living there, we had never met in the vestibule or the elevator, no such\n\nintimacies.\n I think I must have met all the neighbors- about twelve apartments in\n\nthe building, two on a floor- but never her in that small elevator or in the\n\nvestibule.\n I had met her boyfriend in the elevator from time to time.\n He was tall and handsome and charming and apparently well-heeled.\n Once he was carrying flowers and wine once a large water color\n\nlandscape with a glass frame that was spidery shattered and he looked at me\n\nand pointed to the glass and smiled and shrugged his shoulders hopelessly.\n He always had a pleasantry either about the weather or the Viola\n\nsoccer team.\n They weren't doing too well.\n\n\n  He was from Milan.\n I knew that from the license plate on his BMW, which was usually\n\nparked at the entrance of the building.\n Parking on that street was just about impossible and how he always\n\nseemed to find a parking space and one in front of the building, I' 'lldon't\n\nknow.\n There are mysteries to good fortune and they are finally not to be\n\nlooked into.  \n\n<P>  I guess that he was from Milan was why he was not around very\n\nmuch, just a weekend here or there.\n Sometimes I would see them walking the street his arm about her\n\nshoulder and she with her arm about his waist and sometimes her fingers\n\ncurled the edge of his front trouser pocket and sometimes the back trouser\n\npocket and sometimes she placed her hand on his ass. \n\n\n  I did not watch the replay of St. Peter 's.\n My appetite was large.\n I had missed the family day meal so I went along the Borgo degli\n\nAlbizzi and I found Vecchia Firenze open.\n I had a vegetable soup and the house penne and a veal chop and a\n\nradicchio and french fries which I 've got to tell you were invented by the\n\nItalians.\n I drank a red tavola with the meal and then I had an expresso.\n The Vecchia Firenze was jammed with tourists, two or three large\n\ngroups of senior high school college kids from the British Isles or Germany\n\nor something, I can't tell what anymore and I couldn't grab the language in\n\nthe distant din, maybe it was Dutch or Frisian or something, or who knows but\n\nthey could have been from Denmark or Sweden, and so I named them, as usual,\n\nLithuanian. \n\n  Where you came in the main entrance with the low arch, there was\n\none long table at the rear of this room and I was seated close by.\n This great wood table held a family group.\n There was a stately grandmother wearing a good many beautiful jewels.\n She was lean and even her wrinkles had a beauty to them and she was\n\nsitting at the head of the table.\n She sat very straight and never quite smiled but always seemed as if\n\nshe pleasantly were about to.\n She presided over that table like a grate and much beloved Queen.\n She would nod her head up and down in assent to the talk that was not\n\nmerely going on about her but which was always finally addressed to her.\n There were sons and daughter with their families at the table and it\n\nlooked about six grandchildren in all.\n Everyone seemed to be a good eater and they were having a great time\n\nand I enjoyed being near by. \n\n  I continued on up the street and joined the crowds on Via De'\n\nCalzaiuoli.\n They were chiefly a younger generation going up and down and\n\nflirting.\n There was an open gelateria and I had a double scoop, huge, of\n\nchocolate gelato.\n Then I felt the pang in my heart and the tremble in my knees and I\n\nknew I was looking for the great love of my youth. \n\n  There was no reason in the world why I should ever find her, let\n\nalone in Florence, and there was no reason to look then and there, my heart\n\nsorrowfully aching, but I get these damned moments and suddenly I am looking\n\nand wherever I am or have been I look.\n That the soul for you.\n That what yearning does for the soul.\n You become haunted and spooky.\n You are alone and the silly dream persists even in the middle of the\n\njourney when you should not only know better but do know better- no, not\n\nsomething idealized and ennobling, a Beatrice or a Laura, but more like\n\nRogers and Hammerstein than Petrach or Dante, gross, as the kids in America\n\nsay, some kind of their musicals in America, a look across the crowded room\n\nor is it the crowded sea and there she is, lutes and flutes, a slow motion\n\nballet, and I am eating chocolate and she is strawberry gelato.\n What you end up with is the click of high heels on Italian marble,\n\nthe hollow hallway of reverberation.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

So\n\nhe just cordoned it off so people could move through it easily, and people\n\nloved it.\n It was one of the most popular stops on the tour.\n Hopefully, in five years, we'll be able to talk him i 'll it again and\n\nshow the progress.\"\n\n\n  Mining communities, including Jerome, Bisbee, Globe-Miami and\n\nAjo, typically include both modest miners' houses restored in creative ways\n\nas well as larger homes built for or by the mine managers.\n Once you've walked on stepping ston 'vedown an otherwise inaccessible\n\n\" street\" in Jerome, to a home where all groceries are transported in a\n\nchild 's red wagon, you have a better grasp of the challenges and delights of\n\nliving there.\n\n  Bisbee, called Queen of the Mining Towns in its heyday, could\n\ntoday be called Queen of the Home Tour Towns.\n In addition to its 10-year-old fall home tour, another popular\n\nbed-and-breakfast tour is held in June.\n This one focuses on the adaptive reuse of miners' boarding houses,\n\ndefunct schools and large homes originally built for mining executives.\n\n  Last year, Bisbee added another home tour, this one of artists'\n\nhomes and studios, in March.\n\n  \" It really went over well,\" said Pat Hernandez of the Bisbee\n\nChamber of Commerce.\n\n\n  Older desert towns play up their adobe heritage, showing off\n\noriginal details and years of hard work by homeowners.\n Florence, which has more than 130 buildings on the National Historic\n\nRegister, is a virtual catalog of Territorial adobe construction, starting\n\nwith Sonoran-style row houses punctuated by one doorway after another.\n\n  Last year, Tubac started a one-day historic walk.\n Almost all of the buildings in the old part of town are adobe.\n The old Presidio, or fort, is where the tour starts, and visitors can\n\ngo down into an archaeological dig to see the foundations of the original\n\nstructure, built in 1752.\n\n  The local Historical Society already had offered a brochure for a\n\nself-guided tour.\n However, said assistant manager Richard Williams at the Tubac\n\nPresidio, \" we decided that in order to spread the word and generate more\n\ninterest in the historical nature of what we have here, we should one day a\n\nyear make it more similar to the Florence effort.\n\n\n\n  A tour was held of the \" historic\" first homes in Green Valley, a\n\n26-year-old retirement community south of Tucson.\n\n\n  \" People love these things,\" Spater said.\n \" From our point of view, it 's such a seductive way to communicate\n\nhistory.\n\n  \" People absorb tremendous amounts of history doing something\n\nthat 's very fun.\n It 's a wonderful educational project for us.\n You don't have to dress up or go to a lecture hall, just show up for\n\nsomething that 's really fun.\"\n\n  Some tours are fund-raisers that focus on well-appointed homes\n\nthat may or may not have historic status.\n Often, these fund-raisers are held during the holidays.\n Last year, the Pinetop-Lakeside Cup of Cheer Christmas Home Tour\n\noffered refreshments, five homes and an antiques store.\n\n\n  \" And a couple were traditional homes,\" a spokeswoman said.\n \" There are so many mobiles up here...\n The idea is to get decoration ideas.\n\n\n  1) The second Pinal County Courthouse, 102 years old, is one of\n\nthe most recognized buildings in the town and always is on the annual tour of\n\nhistoric buildings in Florence.\n The first courthouse, now McFarland State Park, also is on the\n\ntour.\n\n  2) It 's always 9 o'clock - - or is it 11:45? - on the cupola of\n\nthe second Pinal County Courthouse.\n\n\n  3) The Florence Woman 's Club building is on this year 's community\n\nhistoric tour.\n Woman 's Clubs sponsor some of the many home tours held across the\n\nstate.\n A fireplace inside the club is large enough to accommodate standing\n\nadults. \n\n\n\n NFL Films founder and part-time Scottsdale resident Ed Sabol 's\n\nSuper Bowl streak is in jeopardy.\n\n\n \n\n  For each of the preceding 26 NFL championship games, Sabol has\n\nbeen there.\n Roll the slow-motion footage of Sabol intermixed with images of Super\n\nBowls past: Vince Lombardi on the sidelines.\n\n\n  But this year, Sabol is thinking about sitting out the big\n\ngame.\n\n  Cut to an extreme close-up of Sabol 's eyes that portrays his\n\nindecision.\n A golden-throated narrator explains the significance of THE STREAK in\n\nbattlefield metaphors.\n\n  Ed Sabol, 76, has been more than an idle spectator at each and\n\nevery Super Bowl.\n His NFL Films has been a catalytic force that helped make the NFL a\n\nnational obsession, and has elevated the Super Bowl from a mere game into a\n\nde facto national holiday, a two-week-long event filled with endless hype and\n\nprognostication.\n\n  \" We brought the game into the American living room,\" Sabol said.\n \" It sounds like a simple thing, but I think we've had a huge i 'vect\n\non the game of football.\"\n\n  NFL Films has changed the image of professional football through\n\ninnovations that now seem inseparable from the game: Closely cropped shots in\n\nultra-slow motion.\n Reverse angle.\n Extreme close-ups of a player 's eyes or the sweat dripping from a\n\nlineman 's facemask.\n Candid shots from the sidelines that show victory or defeat as\n\nclearly as the action on the field.\n\n  The imagery and drama that NFL Films has brought to the game has\n\nnot been by accident.\n NFL Films was formed in 1964 by the NFL owners with the expressed\n\npurpose of providing some gloss to the sport 's blue-collar image.\n\n  The company 's roots actually go back a few years further to 1962,\n\nwhen Sabol, now president of the firm, bought the film rights to the NFL\n\nChampionship game.\n Sabol hired free-lance photographers, one of whom shot entirely in\n\nslow motion.\"I knew the people who shot the championship the year before,\"\n\nSabol said.\n \" They only shot in slow motion on third down.\n They said it was too expensive, because it uses so much film.\n I wanted to do something different, to make it more interesting, so I\n\nshot the whole thing in slow motion.\n And then he hired Philadelphia television anchorman John Facenda to\n\ndo the voice-over.\n \" He had a voice that could make a roll of toilet paper sound like\n\nthe U.S. Constitution,\" Sabol said.\n The resulting film, Pro Football 's Longest Day, caught the eye of\n\nthen-NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle.\n Sabol persuaded the owners to purchase his fledgling company and\n\nmake it into a promotional and film-marketing vehicle. Under the agreement,\n\nwhich Rozelle and the owners accepted, each of the 14 NFL team owners chipped\n\nin a one-time start-up fee of\n\n&dollar;20,000. \n\n<P>  With three initial employees, including Sabol 's son, Steve, NFL\n\nFilms' first responsibilities were limited to producing an NFL Championship\n\ngame film and an annual highlights film for each team.\n Later, when the American Football League merged with the NFL in\n\n1967, the company 's responsibilities expanded to include filming AFL teams\n\nand the Super Bowl.\n Under Steve Sabol, who has taken over as president and creative\n\ndirector, NFL Films' signature style jelled.\n The senior Sabol gets credit for the emphasis on slow-motion and for\n\nintroducing the dramatic narration.\n But it was the younger Sabol who brought in many of the other\n\ninnovations. \" We've worke 'ves a team,\" Steve Sabol said.\n \" He was the salesman and the businessman.\n I was the film maker.\n This year, the company 's photographers will shoot about 650 miles of\n\nfilm.\n The Sabols have resisted suggestions that they switch over to\n\nless-expensive video.\n Steve Sabol likens film to the rich and varied grains a craftsman\n\nbrings out in wood.\n Video is more like Formica, he said.\n The company 's celluloid purchases make it Eastman Kodak 's largest\n\ncustomer, he said.\n\n<P>  \" We wouldn't be NFL Films without film,\" he said.\n \" Film is an essential part of the distinctive feel and mystique of\n\nour productions.\n We're 're journalists; we're 'rerytellers, romantics,\n\nphilosophers.\"\n\n\n  The company 's voracious consumption of film, combined with an\n\naggressive campaign to buy up early footage, has led to the world 's largest\n\ncollection of film from any professional sport. The vault at the company 's\n\nMount Laurel, N.J., headquarters contains every print of every professional\n\nfootball game since 1948, every print of championship games since the early '\n\n30s, and selected prints dating even further back.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "376fe2ca-5993-4d1e-80bc-17c56e37a87a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.744922+00:00"}
{"text": "\" Caryl Phillips' The Final Passage: On the Migrations To and From\n\nthe Caribbean\"\n\n A paper for Postcolonial Literature From the Anglophone Caribbean,\n\na course taught by Professor Mair.\n\n  The British novelist, Graham Swift, has written-- In keeping with\n\nhis [ Phillips'] nomadic inclination, it could be said that one of the main\n\nthemes of his work is that of the journey or, rather differently, of human\n\ndisplacement and dislocation in a variety of forms ( 96).\n\n  Indeed, this theme of migration and its implications for the black\n\nCaribbean individual is the central one explored in Phillips' first novel\n\nentitled The Final Passage ( originally published in 1985).\n It is also the theme that will be examined in this essay both in close\n\nrelation to the text and in a wider historical and cultural context.\n\n  The title of Phillips' first novel is rather provocative because\n\nit refers to ( and depicts the \" extension\" of) the legacy of the Middle\n\nPassage-- the second leg of the triangular trade that the European\n\nimperialists established after they conquered much of the New World ( and\n\nAfrica); the impact of slavery on Caribbean history will be briefly discussed\n\n( Richardson 38-9).\n In order to ( in)validate Phillips' \" thesis\" concerning modern\n\nCaribbean migration, the portraits of his Caribbean characters on their \"\n\nfinal passage\" will be analyzed with respect to the sociological realities of\n\nimmigration to the United Kingdom in the twentieth century.\n And finally, the implications of the \" final passage\"/migration for\n\nthe Caribbean writer will be discussed in regard to Phillips ( and other\n\nauthors).\n\n  The legacy of colonialism in the Caribbean began, of course, with\n\nChristopher Columbus in 1492.\n On his second journey to the Caribbean ( which he had mistaken for\n\nislands off the coast of China) Columbus introduced sugar cane-the crop that\n\nis nearly synonymous with the area today ( Richardson 27).\n Although economic interest in the Caribbean waned for a time ( due to\n\ndecline of the Spanish empire), the further introduction of sugar cane into\n\nthe region by other European powers ( i.e. the English and the French) firmly\n\nestablished colonial rule by the mid-seventeenth century ( Richardson 29).\n Soon the plantation islands of the Caribbean were considered the most\n\nvaluable possessions of the overseas imperial world ( Richardson 39).\n In light of this fact, it is not surprising that there was a constant\n\nstate of instability in the Caribbean throughout the eighteenth century due\n\nto trade wars--manifested in stringent trade laws and literal warfare--among\n\nthe European powers ( Richardson 55).\n\n  In large part, this demand for sugar in Europe created the\n\nCaribbean.\n To put it in more concrete terms, the European demand for sugar was\n\none of the key factors in setting up the notorious triangular trade-a \" Negro\n\nslave trade, Negro slavery, and Caribbean sugar production\" ( Williams 140).\n Typically, a ship set sail from a European metropolitan country with\n\na cargo of metropolitan goods, which were then exchanged on the coast of West\n\nAfrica for slaves.\n This was the first side of the triangle.\n The second leg ( often referred to as the Middle Passage) consisted\n\nof a voyage from West Africa to the West Indies with the newly purchased\n\nslaves.\n The triangle was completed as the ships returned to the metropolitan\n\ncountry with sugar and other Caribbean products which were gotten in exchange\n\nfor slaves ( Williams 141).\n\n  This triangular trade created a market for slaves in West Africa\n\nand the Caribbean and bolstered the economies of the European home countries\n\n( William 140).\n The purchase of slaves in West Africa and their maintenance in the\n\nCaribbean provided great stimulus to metropolitan industry and agriculture (\n\ni.e.\n an increase in English wool production for clothing and blankets for\n\nCaribbean slaves) ( Williams 141).\n In Europe, the triangular trade was the source of great wealth and\n\npride.\n\n\n  In contrast, the triangular trade often meant tragedy for the\n\nWest Africans who were transported to the Caribbean.\n Besides the psychological blow of being captured, sold, and then\n\ncarried to the New World as a slave, many West Africans were subject to\n\nmalnourishment and disease on the Middle Passage; many slaves committed\n\nsuicide and tried ( unsuccessfully) to rebel against their captors (\n\nRichardson 65).\n It is estimated that three out of ten slaves died on the Middle\n\nPassage ( Williams 139).\n\n  In the autobiography, The Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus\n\nVassa, the African, the former slave and anti-slavery crusader relates his\n\nMiddle Passage experience in this way--\n\n  ...I was soon put down under the decks, and there I received such\n\na salutation to my nostrils as I had never received in my life; so that, with\n\nthe loathsomeness of the stench, and crying together, I became so sick and\n\nlow that I was not able to eat, nor had I the least desire to taste anything.\n\n\n  From this personal account, one can see that the Middle Passage\n\nand imperialism in general had dire consequences for the Africans sold into\n\nslavery.\n\n  Slavery remained the primary means of Caribbean labor for\n\ncenturies until the last slaves were freed in Cuba in 1886 ( Richardson 63).\n It is estimated that 4.6 million African slaves were brought into the\n\nregion ( Richardson 63).\n The Middle Passage constituted one of the greatest migrations in\n\nrecorded history ( Williams 144).\n\n  After the second World War, another great migration, involving\n\nthe Caribbean, occurred.\n From the 1955 to 1985, it is estimated that more than 4 million\n\nCaribbean persons emigrated from the islands--a total equal to the number of\n\nslaves brought into the area during the late seventeenth and eighteenth\n\ncenturies ( Guengant and Marshall 4-5).\n Throughout this thirty year span, a large section of the Caribbean\n\npopulation travelled to the United States and to Canada, but early on (\n\nthroughout the fifties and early sixties) the United Kingdom was often their\n\ndestination ( Guengant and Marshall 4-5).\n\n  The fateful consequence of the aftermath of WW II in Britain--the\n\nneed for unskilled labor to rebuild the nation after a war that had reduced\n\nBritish manpower--led to an exodus of Caribbean people to the United Kingdom\n\nin the 1950 's ( Richardson 142).\n Still, from the sociological data available, it is evident that this\n\nexodus had not necessarily led the Caribbean emigrant to a place of greater\n\nfreedom or opportunity to rise in the world.\n Rather, it usually meant a continuation of the legacy of colonialism\n\ndespite the British Nationality Act of 1948 which had conferred the same\n\nlegal rights to the Commonwealth members accorded to all British citizens (\n\nThompson 41).\n\n After arriving in Britain--the \" mother country\"-- most Caribbean persons\n\nwere given the worst jobs at the lowest pay, and they often had to live in\n\nlow-grade inner city housing--many of them in neighborhoods considered slums\n\nlong before the workers emigrated to the country ( Thompson 47).\n In general, a color bar was in place in Britain which denied the\n\nmajority of Caribbean people access to proper lodgings, service in cafes, and\n\nentrance to dance halls, among other rights \" accorded British citizens\";\n\nalso, the emigrants were often subject to rude racial comments in public in\n\nthe trams, and in buses ( Thompson 47).\n\n  In his fascinating book entitled Double Passage, George Gmelch\n\nrecords the oral histories of thirteen Barbadian men and women who emigrated\n\nto Britain ( and North America) and later returned their island homes.\n As varied and as rich as these oral histories are, Gmelch noticed a\n\ncommon phenomena: many of the migrants were surprised upon their arrival to\n\nEngland; many of them were shocked at the dilapidated conditions of\n\nneighborhoods and dismayed at the distant and reserved manners of the British\n\nwhite majority ( 264).\n Although many of the narratives showed that the migrants adjusted\n\nrather well to their manual jobs as well as big city life and seemed\n\ngratified with their relatively higher pay, Gmelch points out that most of\n\nthe Barbadians faced racial discrimination ( especially in regard to jobs and\n\nhousing) and had a Caribbean orientation as opposed to an assimiliationist\n\nattitude in regard to England ( 267-70, 274-8).\n\n  Perhaps all of this can be poetically summed up by the title of\n\nthe closing chapter in George Lamming 's The Pleasures of Exile; after all, it\n\nis clear that many of the Caribbean emigrants, like Lamming, had been on a \"\n\nJourney To An Expectation.\"\n Indeed, in this closing chapter, Lamming points out that any notion\n\nthat West Indian had been truly considered an equal in the eyes of the white\n\nBritish majority was nothing but an \" illusion\" ( 218).\n With bitter irony, Lamming finds it amazing that \" a certain type\n\nWest Indian\" would go to great lengths to assure white friends that life in\n\nEngland has been nothing but a \" memorable participation in civilised\n\npleasures\" ( 218).\n\n  Caryl Phillips picks up on Lamming 's thread and weaves a tragic\n\ntale in The Final Passage.\n From the novel, one can see that Phillips has sufficiently portrayed\n\nthe plight of many Caribbean emigrants to the United Kingdom and that his \"\n\nthesis\" concerning this social phenomena is more or less pessimistic.\n After reading the novel, one realizes that the \" final passage\" is\n\nnot the final leg of a Homeric journey where the hero is triumphant; rather,\n\nit is the continuation of the legacy of the Middle Passage.\n This narrative--not unlike the ones in the Double Passage and the\n\nother sociological data above-- reveals a difficult ( if not downright sad)\n\nfate for the Caribbean individual in England.\n At the end, Leila, the main protagonist of the novel, decides to go\n\nback to her sunny island home as all the Barbadians in the Double Passage did\n\n( Final 203).\n\n  Much of this elliptically told novel takes place on an\n\nunspecified Caribbean island and focuses on four characters: Leila, a half\n\nwhite, half black woman; Michael, her irresponsible husband; Millie, Leila 's\n\nbest friend; and Bradeth, Millie 's ( eventual) husband and Michael 's drinking\n\nbuddy.\n Two other characters, Leila 's mother and Leila 's son, Calvin, appear\n\nthroughout the book and play important roles in regard to main\n\nprotagonist.\n\n  In the large chapter, \" Home,\" Phillips paints a balanced\n\nportrait of the Caribbean island, adequately depicting the island 's natural\n\nbeauty as well as the parochialism of many of its inhabitants.\n This reader had a difficult time with this section of the novel due\n\nin large part to the heavy handed Christian symbolism ( i.e.\n the cock crowing, signifying Michael 's marital infidelity to Leila)\n\nand the meandering narrative.\n This awkwardness of depicting the island is likely due to Phillips\n\nhaving grown up in England and not in the Caribbean as many of the novelists\n\nthe previous generation had.\n\n  For this essay, the chapters which make up the second half of the\n\nnovel-- \" England\", \" Passage\", and \" Winter\"--will be closely examined.\n It is in these chapters that Phillips' writing seems most assured and\n\nthat his mind seems to be at work most feverishly.\n\n  In the chapter called \" England,\" Leila, Michael, and Calvin have\n\nalready spent four months in the \" mother country.\"\n The chapter opens with Leila on the bus, going to visit her mother in\n\nthe hospital for what she calculates to be her 106th time.\n ( It was revealed earlier that Leila 's forty-one year old mother had\n\ngone to England to seek more sophisticated care ( 69).)\n On one of the past visits Leila 's mother, squeezing her daughter 's\n\nhand, says--\"Leila, child, London is not my home....And I don't want you to\n\nforget that either\" ( 124).\n\n  After some other motherly reflections on the pride of a Caribbean\n\nwoman in avoiding being beaten by a man, the chapter concludes as Leila\n\narrives at the hospital, finding that her mother has passed on.\n Leila laments her passing because \" she barely knew her mother\" and\n\nfeels guilty because she had rebelled against her mother by marrying her\n\ndespicable husband, Michael ( 132).\n\n  In this short chapter, Phillips makes the finality implied in the \"\n\nfinal passage\" rather obvious.\n Leila 's mother dies in a foreign country, far away from what she\n\nconsiders home.\n Also, Leila 's hopes for making her peace with her mother and truly\n\ngetting to know her die there.\n England is not the place in which final ( or ultimate) hopes ( i.e.\n\nthose of physical and spiritual renewal) are realized for black Caribbeans;\n\nit is in fact a place for death of both physical life and spiritual hope.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7c67d722-ddc1-4498-9561-26e4764f7c7f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.746254+00:00"}
{"text": "My father, who grew up on a Pennsylvania farm, loved the ocean and\n\nthought every boy should have his own boat.\n So one spring, he spent several evenings by our seaside home working\n\nunder a lantern late into the night.\n Eagerly, I fetched the tools and held the tape measure while he marked\n\ncarefully with the flat carpenter 's pencil he kept tucked behind his ear.\n Each night after putting the baby to bed, Mom came outside to watch.\n \" It 's going to be a beautiful boat,\" she said as she stood in the\n\nlantern 's glow, wind pressing her skirt to her knees, blowing her dark, wavy\n\nhair into her eyes.\n\n  The boat was a sturdy ten-foot skiff, a three-seater with a small\n\nkeel that caused it to pitch slightly when ashore as if riding the crest of a\n\nwave.\n Each spring I sanded the peeling paint, caulked the seams, primed\n\ninside and out, then chose new colors.\n The first year, I painted it emerald green, the second, navy blue.\n But the year my boat drifted off, it was scarlet with white trim and\n\na waterline outlined in black.\n\n  When we heard it had washed ashore on the other side of the\n\nharbor, anchoring itself in a tangle of marsh grass, I was relieved.\n I hadn't notice the new moon, and the spring tide had lifted my boat\n\nfrom it 's perch.\n As my father and I drove across town in his pickup to retrieve it, I\n\nfelt like his foolish child.\n\n  The town was quiet and fall-like that July day.\n Whitecaps rose on the deep water like goose flesh.\n On such days you can taste salt on your lips and later when you try\n\nto comb your hair, you find it hopelessly matted and snarled and gritty with\n\nsand.\n\n  As we passed Egg Island, men with waders and long-handle rakes\n\ncombed the flats, leaving deep, purple scars in the smooth, brown silt while\n\ngulls wheeled expectantly overhead.\n A few sunbathers dotted the shore, most lying between dunes or beside\n\nthe breakwater seeking shelter from wind and sand.\n\n\n  That day, I had more on my mind than weather or lost boats.\n While surveying the empty landscape, my thoughts turned to my mother\n\nwho for the second time in two months was gone without warning--once to visit\n\nher sister, this time her mother, or so I was told.\n Before she left, my parents talked in their bedroom late into the\n\nnight.\n I heard no words, only voices, intermittent and foreboding, like\n\nwaves before a storm.\n The next morning, my mother stood by the door in her blue travel\n\ndress with the small, white polka dots.\n She kissed my sister and me good-bye and said, \" Behave for your\n\nfather.\u001d\n I watched my father who stood holding Mom 's suitcase, one hand on the\n\ndoorknob.\n\n\n  Always my father had been quiet, but during that spring and\n\nsummer he seemed lost.\n Some days, he sat at the breakfast table resting his forehead in one\n\nhand, a cigarette smoldering in the other, its cool white ashes falling\n\nsilently on the table.\n Other times, he stirred his coffee absently, the cup ringing softly\n\nlike a tiny bell.\n\n  Mom busied herself in the kitchen washing out coffee cups, mixing\n\npancake batter, struggling with a can of frozen orange juice.\n \" Eat your breakfast,\" she told Kristen, \" and you'll be big an 'll\nstrong like your brother.\"\n\n  Even Kristen seemed to know something was up: \" What 's the\n\nmatter, Daddy?\n Are you sad?\" she asked kneeling on her chair, rocking back and forth\n\nin her Rocky and Bullwinkle pajamas, stirring her Lucky Charms.\n\n  After Mom left, Kristen and I were on our own most of the time.\n Dad usually came home from the fish market at 5:30 and handed me a\n\nbag of groceries.\n While he showered and I scrubbed the potatoes, Kristen asked, \" When\n\nis Mommy coming home?\"\n\n \n\n  After dinner, Dad kissed Kristen good night, said, \" Mind your\n\nbrother,\" and left.\n Often, I waited up all hours listening from my bedroom window for his\n\ntruck.\n Always, he turned off the headlights before turning into the darkened\n\ndriveway.\n He closed the cab door softly and walked slowly across the gravel\n\nsurface.\n Once inside, he took off his shoes and, in his stocking feet, crept\n\nup the creaking stairs and past my bedroom door where I lay still, quietly\n\ncursing him for his silence. \n\n  My father and I traced the shoreline around the harbor, past\n\ndunes and beach grass, past the marina, the bait shop, and the Tastee Freeze.\n Dad had the truck radio tuned to a country-western station.\n There was one song--the name escapes me, but sometimes even now when\n\nit 's late at night and everything is still, that deep, trembling voice and\n\nthe soft sighs of those steel guitars, they all come back to me just as if\n\nthey had never stopped.\n\n  When we spotted the grounded boat, Dad backed the truck into a\n\nclearing beside the road.\n We let down the tailgate, then walked through beach grass and over\n\ndeep sand.\n\n\n \n\n  \" I'll go,\" I 'lld him as I took off my sneakers and rolled up my\n\njeans.\n While my father waited, he lit a cigarette, turning his back to the\n\nwind and cupping the match in his hands.\n\n  Cautiously, I stepped over the rocky shoreline to the cool\n\nwater 's edge.\n When I neared the boat, fiddler crabs scurried into their holes, and\n\nterns, protecting nearby nests, swooped toward me and screeched warnings.\n I grabbed the boat and wrenched it free, eventually tugging it into\n\nthe water.\n I looked up, but Dad didn't see me.\n He stared across the harbor at the rows of cottages and the eroding\n\ndunes.\n\n  Once I reached shore, Dad took the bow and I the stern as we\n\ntrudged through the sand toward the truck.\n We loaded it stern first, each taking a side, lifting it up and\n\nsliding it onto the truck bed.\n Dad handed me my shoes, and I sat on the tailgate with my back\n\nagainst the boat while I brushed the sand from my feet and laced my sneakers.\n Again he stared across the bay, lingering briefly before stepping\n\ninto the cab.\n\n  At first, we rode in silence.\n Finally, about halfway home, my father spoke.\n He said my mother was at the hospital--not my grandmother 's, not my\n\naunt 's.\n The first time for tests, this time, surgery.\n I listened calmly to my father 's calm words: \" We didn't want to\n\nworry you,\" he said.\n \" The doctors say there 's this new treatment, some new medicine.\n\n\n  As he spoke, my mind wandered: I lay in a lawn chair on the front\n\ndeck, eyes closed as the sun warmed my face.\n Overhead an airplane droned, miles off and fading, and from an\n\nupstairs window came my mother 's voice as she sang the baby to sleep.\n\n  By evening the wind had stopped.\n After dinner, I left Kristen with the neighbors and took the boat\n\nout, rowing in long, smooth strokes, oarlocks rumbling, oars knifing the\n\nsurface, leaving faint whirling ripples in the glassy sea, propelling me\n\nfarther and farther over the deep, blue water, past the jetty, out where you\n\ncan see everything--draggers tied to long, jagged rows of marina pilings,\n\nscattered sloops moored in the harbor basin, gray shingled cottages clustered\n\nalong the shore, white clapboard houses with their tall peaks and dormers\n\nperched on higher ground, and the tarnished copper steeple of the\n\nCongregational church towering above all else.\n Finally, I put up the oars and sat adrift, my wake quickly swallowed\n\nby the stillness.\n A heavy silence hung over the town and covered the bay.\n I heard no surf, no wind, no voices, only distant sighs from the\n\nwhistle buoy and water dripping from my oars.\n\n  My mother lived barely two months more.\n A few weeks before Mom died, Dad took Kristen and me to see her.\n Shrunken and childlike, curled beneath her hospital sheets, she\n\nmoaned for the doctors to leave her alone.\n\n\n  It was over three years before I really understood what it meant.\n The moving men had finished loading the tractor trailer.\n My father, his second wife, and Kristen had already left for their\n\nnew home in Florida.\n Since I was staying with friends for the rest of my senior year, it\n\nwas my job to close up our house.\n\n  After the huge truck pulled away, I walked through our home for\n\nthe last time.\n The rooms looked spacious and unfamiliar.\n Gone were the things that had surrounded me my whole life--the wicker\n\nrocking chair, the camelback sofa, my mother 's carnival glass, the set of\n\nFunk and Wagnalls on the mantel, the wedding pictures on the den wall.\n As I walked through each room, across the bare wood floors, my\n\nfootsteps echoed.\n\n  Before leaving, I opened the cellar door, pulled the light chain,\n\nand found my way down the narrow stairs to the concrete floor.\n The musty smell of old clothes and newspapers lingered.\n The tool boxes, cabinets, wardrobes, and chests had all been packed\n\naway, making the cellar appear cavernous in the dim light.\n\n  Off to one side by the window wells sat my boat, belly-up beneath\n\na naked light bulb, resting on the same spindly, paint-speckled saw horses my\n\nfather had used when he built it.\n Seeing it there all by itself made me realize how, in a sense, my\n\nfamily too had been swept away and left adrift unprepared for the coming\n\ntide.\n\n  Lingering briefly alongside the boat, I chipped away at its\n\npeeling paint and ran my hand over its worn keel.\n For a moment, I saw my father sitting beside me in his truck on the\n\nday we recovered the boat, his hair windblown, his face taut.\n\n\n  Then, I saw my mother and father standing beside my unfinished\n\nboat, arm in arm under the lantern light, both of them smiling like\n\nnewlyweds.\n\n  Although Vulma did wonders for my vocabulary, words to describe\n\nher remain elusive.\n Onomatopoetic comes to mind, though that one might take some\n\nexplaining.\n\n  Vulma and her mother had just bought a small cottage near my\n\nhouse, and her arrival did not go unnoticed.\n Everyone, including myself, considered her a kind of goddess.\n Auburn hair, chestnut eyes, long legs.\n The works.\n Wherever she went, heads turned.\n The joke around town was that her reputation preceded her . . . by\n\nseveral inches.\n To add to her mystique, Vulma was from Quebec and spoke with a\n\nFrench accent.\n But perhaps what bewildered people most about Vulma was the crush\n\nshe had for me.\n\n  By all accounts, this should have been welcome news.\n After all, I'd 'deen the toothpaste ads, the chewing gum commercials,\n\nthe new car calendars.\n I knew what was expected of me.\n However, there was one problem--I couldn't stand to hear her talk.\n You see, Vulma used words like phenomenal whenever she got the\n\nchance--as in, \" Isn't this weather phenomenal?\" or, \" That 's a phenomenal\n\nsong!\" Thoughts of how she learned to talk like that gave me chills.\n To me, Vulma 's English was a foreign language.\n Granted, a lot of guys would have found ways around that.\n Believe me I tried, but I knew if she didn't have that long, wavy\n\nhair, or if her Levis didn't behave that way when she walked, she never would\n\nhave crossed my mind.\n\n  When people asked why I didn't jump at the chance to be with\n\nher, I shrugged.\n This was the seventies, mind you, and sex was a breeze.\n At least it was supposed to be.\n After all, we had The Pill and Roe vs. Wade.\n Barring allergies to penicillin, you were home free.\n Apparently, I just wasn't with it.\n \" You 're crazy!\" guys said.\n A couple of them flat out wanted to punch me.\n If they couldn't have her, they at least wanted the benefit of some\n\nplay-by-play.\n\n  As you might expect, my sexual preference quickly became a\n\nsource of speculation.\n While I could have spent my time with Vulma, instead, I spent most\n\nof it with two guys who, to my great misfortune, happened to be named Peter\n\nand Paul.\n This naturally inspired someone ( Peter, I think) with the brilliant\n\nidea to start calling me Mary, which by itself wouldn't have been such a big\n\ndeal.\n But the singing--that was too much.\n Seeing Vulma, then, only reminded me what a phenomenal\n\ndisappointment I was to my gender.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

Stephen F.Lynch said there is \" general opposition to\n\nthe mass of the project\" while questioning whether a 715-unit project could\n\nclear state environmental hurdles. \n\n\n 'Best' hole proved fatal: Boy killed in cave-in at beach was to\n\nleave soon\n\n\n  Moments before 13-year-old Ivan Smith was to leave Salisbury\n\nBeach Tuesday night, the Andover boy took one last cannonball-style jump into\n\na deep hole that he and his three friends had spent all day digging.\n\n  Rescuers tried to save 13-year-old Ivan Smith.\n ( Staff photo by Mike Adaskaveg) But the triumph of creating the \"\n\nbest ( hole) we ever dug\" ended tragically when the hole 's walls caved-in\n\nfrom the impact of his jump, causing the piles of sand the boys had shoveled\n\nout of the hole to fall in and bury Smith.\n\n  Smith, a paperboy who would have been an eighth-grader this fall,\n\nwas pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n  \" The mother had gone to get something and had come back down to\n\nget them.\n They looked like they were heading out,\" said Cory, a 15-year-old\n\nLawrence boy who befriended Smith and his three buddies on Tuesday.\n\n  \" They were just having fun and digging,\" said Cory, who did not\n\nwant his last name used.\n\n\n  Cory, other witnesses and a neighbor said Smith had spent the day\n\nat the beach with three neighborhood brothers, and his mother, Nancy T.Smith.\n His older brother, Nicholas, and his brother 's female friend, who\n\nwere both in wheelchairs, were also with them, witnesses said.\n\n  Smith and his three pals started digging what would become a 3\n\n1/2-to 4-foot deep hole with a plastic shovel at about noon, witnesses said.\n Other youngsters at the beach stopped by throughout the day to offer\n\na hand.\n\n  By the end of the day, beachgoers said they couldn't see the\n\nboys' heads as they shoveled out sand from inside the hole and piled it on\n\nthe beach around them.\n\n  The three boys took a break to play pool, continued to dig and\n\ntook turns jumping in the hole - which they dug on a stretch of sand between\n\nthe 5 O'Clock Lounge and the Beach Club on Ocean Front Street, witnesses\n\nsaid.\n\n  One of the boys was climbing out of the hole as Smith made his\n\nfinal jump, but managed to get free before the heavy, soft sand collapsed on\n\nSmith, Salisbury Fire Chief Paul Antonellis Jr.\n\n\n  Witnesses said the boys began digging their friend out and ran\n\ninto the nearby 5 O'Clock Lounge for help.\n\n  When Smith 's mother returned, witnesses said she began to panic\n\nwhen told that her son was beneath the sand.\n\n\n  When rescue workers arrived, Antonellis said the area where the\n\nhole had been looked like regular beach, with no evidence of where the boy\n\nwas except for the friends telling rescue workers where to dig.\n\n  \" There were no indentations and the area hadn't been disturbed.\n\n\n  Antonellis said the boys might have been digging one to three\n\nminutes before calling for help.\n But because of the hole 's depth and the weight of the sand, the\n\nresult probably would have been the same even if a crew was \" sitting right\n\nthere,\" Antonellis said.\n\n  Rescue workers rushed to the scene at about 8:15 p.m., using\n\nbuckets and their hands to reach the boy 's head, which they unearthed in\n\nabout 15 minutes.\n\n  Antonellis said when they reached the boy 's head, he was not\n\nbreathing and there was no sign of a heartbeat.\n\n\n  Eric Ramsdell, who lives near Smith 's North Tanglewood Way home,\n\nwatched rescue workers with tears in his eyes.\n\n  \" We were digging a really big hole,\" he told The Daily News of\n\nNewburyport.\n\n\n  Yesterday, witnesses left crosses and flowers at a makeshift\n\nmemorial where the boys had dug the hole.\n\n  To Andover neighbors Larry and Esther Taylor, Smith was like a\n\nson.\n Smith rode his bike and walked to school with their 12-year-old son\n\nJared.\n\n  \" He went camping with our sons and stayed overnight.\n\n\n  Jared said his friend had two cats and wanted to be a\n\nveterinarian when he was older.\n\n  Smith, who is the son of Andover Town Accountant Rodney Smith,\n\nhad just finished working at a camp run by the Massachusetts Society for the\n\nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals, Esther Taylor said.\n\n\n  \" He was the glue of the neighborhood.\n He got everybody together.\n\n\n  His principal at the Doherty Middle School, Floyd McManus, said\n\nSmith was well-liked by teachers and peers.\n\n  \" He excelled at physical education and Latin.\n He was his own person and well-respected,\" McManus said.\n\n\n\n\n\n  A contrite Lt. Gov. Jane Swift expressed \" regret for everything\n\nthat 's happened\" after the State Ethics Commission yesterday cited her with\n\none ethical violation but cleared her of four others.\n\n  Lt. Gov. Jane Swift talks to reporters yesterday.\n \" I owe an apology to the citizens of Massachusetts,\" Swift said.\n\n\n  Swift 's repeated apologies came just minutes after the ethics\n\npanel all-but cleared her of wrong-doing, saying she had done nothing wrong\n\nby using a state police helicopter to beat pre-Thanksgiving traffic and\n\nasking aides to help her family move from Boston to Northbridge.\n\n  The commission, after a five-hour meeting, found only that Swift\n\nhad created the \" appearance of impropriety\" by asking two staffers, Susan\n\nSaliba and Sarah Dohoney, to babysit for her daughter on their own time.\n\n  But the panel said babysitting by a third aide, Stacey Rainey,\n\nwho is now Swift 's deputy chief of staff, did not create an ethical\n\nissue.\n\n  The commission found no problem with Swift 's practice of asking\n\nstaffers to watch her daughter, Elizabeth Ruth Hunt, while the toddler was\n\nvisiting her mother in the State House.\n\n  In clearing Swift of charges that she misused the helicopter, the\n\nfour-member commission rejected a staff recommendation that found \"\n\nreasonable cause\" to believe the chopper ride constituted \" unwarranted\" use\n\nof a privilege of her office.\n\n  The panel, whose deliberations are confidential, did not release\n\ndetails of its decision last night.\n\n  Swift 's lawyer, Cheryl Cronin, said she expected the commission\n\nto release a letter explaining parts of the decision later this week.\n\n  The commission could have imposed a\n\n&dollar;2,000 fine on Swift for the babysitting violations but instead left the\n\nterms of any punishment to be negotiated by ethics staffers and Cronin.\n\n  Despite the near-vindication Swift said she not feel relieved by\n\nthe decision, but rather only \" regret\" for the disappointment she caused\n\npeople who put their trust into her.\n\n  Swift, who was engulfed in a political firestorm in January when\n\nshe refused to take responsibility for the chopper flight, also sought to put\n\nher earlier defiance behind her.\n\n  Characterizing the last few months as \" difficult\" and \"\n\nuncomfortable,\" Swift said she intends to approach the future by working hard\n\non issues such as education.\n\n  \" It will be up to me to prove to the voters that the confidence\n\nthey placed in me almost two years ago was warranted,\" said Swift, a\n\nRepublican.\n\n\n  She assured the voters that she would not to commit the same\n\nmistakes in the future, promising a \" bright line\" between her personal and\n\nprofessional life in the future.\n\n  But Ken White, executive director of Common Cause/Massachusetts,\n\nsaid Swift 's personal resolution was not enough.\n\n  \" I'm surp 'msed the administration has not reacted in a\n\ncomprehensive way ? by putting into place stricter procedures and policies on\n\nethics,\" White said, calling on the administration to rescue a comprehensive\n\n1995 ethics reform bill from its \" legislative graveyard.\"\n\n  And Swift refused to hold herself to a higher standard than the\n\none set by the ethics commission, ducking a question about whether she would\n\nreimburse the state for the estimated\n\n&dollar;1,000 cost of the chopper.\n\n  \" For today ( I plan to abide by that commission 's decision)\n\nthat 's the most important message I have,\" she said.\n\n  But Swift, 35, clearly recognized the damage she has caused to\n\nher political career.\n\n  \" I think that there is no doubt that I made mistakes and the\n\npublic has lost some confidence in my ability to provide leadership on the\n\nissues they care about,\" Swift said.\n\n  Swift 's tenure has been plagued with scandals and consequential\n\nlow approval ratings since media reports disclosed that she tapped taxpayer\n\nfunds for her own personal use.\n She also recently forced to resign from a teaching post at Suffolk\n\nUniversity that many viewed as overpaid.\n\n  Swift 's infamous helicopter ride last Thanksgiving to escape\n\nholiday traffic triggered public criticism, which turned into outrage when\n\nshe attempted to defend her actions.\n\n  A week after the flight was made public, Swift finally apologized\n\nand sent a letter to the State Ethics Commission asking whether she misused\n\nstate resources and should reimburse taxpayers for the cost of the helicopter\n\nflight.\n\n  But the state troopers that were part of her security detail\n\ntestified before the commission that they, not Swift, ordered the chopper for\n\nsecurity reasons.\n\n  The three aids who babysat her daughter - two of whom Swift\n\nhelped land lucrative promotions - denied that they felt any pressure from\n\nSwift to babysit, citing their longstanding friendship with the lieutenant\n\ngovernor. \n\n\n Key Sox adviser jumps ship on ballpark: Menino pal 's departure\n\nmay jeopardize project\n\n  In a potentially devastating blow to the Red Sox' plans for a\n\n&dollar;665 million ballpark, development consultant Bob Walsh has bolted the\n\nproject as the team enters a critical juncture in its two-year pursuit of a\n\nnew field of dreams.\n\n  The surprise departure leaves a huge void between Sox CEO John\n\nHarrington and Mayor Thomas M.Menino, since Walsh served as a critical\n\ngo-between in the often-stormy relationship.\n\n  \" It seemed to be in the best interests of our company,\" said\n\nWalsh, who notified Harrington two weeks ago that RF Walsh Inc.\n was severing its relationship with the Sox.\n \" We' 'rein the project management and construction business, not\n\ngovernment relations.\"\n\n  But it was Walsh 's relationship to Menino and his familiarity\n\nwith the machinations at City Hall that were invaluable to Harrington.\n\n  The Sox chief angered the mayor more than once during delicate\n\ntalks over a massive\n\n&dollar;313 million public subsidy package.\n\n  \" We totally appreciate his involvement in this,\" said Red Sox\n\nspokeswoman Kathryn St. John, adding that Harrington and Sox General Manager\n\nDan Duquette have open lines of communication with the mayor.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4baa1b5b-e022-479f-b619-c5277a83c407", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.748934+00:00"}
{"text": "This report analyzes UMD 's peer tutoring center tutor training\n\nprogram and presents an alternative solution for improved tutor training.\n\n\n  The present tutor training system has been in effect from the\n\ninception of the tutoring center over six years ago.\n The training program has been a success and has helped many students\n\nthrough the tutoring experience, but has also gotten old and needs to grow\n\nwith the tutoring center.\n\n  Some tutors are not getting the continuing education they desire\n\nas they become more experienced and want to go further in their educational\n\nabilities.\n The present system allows them only one quarter of classroom\n\nexperience to absorb this information.\n Tutors are also not getting enough praise for the work they do and\n\nwould appreciate some benefit for their volunteer time and effort.\n Lastly, tutors a program to keep them in closer contact with the\n\nfaculty of their educational discipline in order to remain up to date on the\n\nstatus of the classes and teaching techniques.\n\n\n  The College Reading and Learning Association 's accreditation\n\nprocess remedies two of these three problems.\n First of all, it offers tutors the chance to complete three\n\nsingle-quarter classes instead of just one.\n The extra classes give tutors the opportunity to expand their\n\nknowledge and experience following a guideline for national accreditation.\n The accreditation also gives tutors recognition for their work, which\n\nis an added incentive to participate and excell.\n\n\n  With the continued growth and success of the peer tutoring center\n\nat UMD, it is ever more important to focus on one skills of its peer tutors\n\nand on the training they receive.\n This paper examines the implementation of a program to nationally\n\ncertify tutors through an expanded training program.\n This program would benefit both tutors and the students they work\n\nwith if it were shown to be effective and convenient enough for all involved.\n Strengths and weaknesses of the present tutor training program and\n\nthe proposed certification program will be presented, along with a\n\nrecommendation for the most feasible alternative.\n\n\n  The peer tutoring center at UMD was set up just six years ago and\n\nhas continued to follow the same general principals throughout its history.\n It is a true success story in that there were no other models\n\navailable at the time on which to base this type of learning center.\n The tutoring center is original because of its integration into the\n\nacademic fabric of the school, and also because of its continued growth over\n\nthe years.\n From fall of 1987 to present, the number of tutorials has grown from\n\n816 to approximately 4000 per quarter.\n In addition, many other universities are now using the tutoring\n\nprogram here as a model to base their own.\n The faculty involved in the program have given many national\n\npresentations to other interested campuses around the United States (\n\nTreuer)\n\n\n  As the number of tutor and tutorials have grown over the years,\n\nso has the need for improved training.\n The training program that was developed six years ago with ~he\n\nintroduction of UMD 's tutoring center was completely original and has for the\n\nmost part served its purpose well.\n\n  With the introduction of additional tutoring disciplines and\n\nincreased expectations of students, a more specialized and structured program\n\nhas become necessary.\n Some tutors have voiced the opinion that they are not given the\n\nopportunity to develop their skills fully and would like the opportunity for\n\nincreased instruction in the art of peer tutoring ( Treuer) .\n The training system in place now gives tutors the opportunity to\n\nparticipate in only one full quarter training practicum.\n This class covers the basics of teaching, learning styles, and\n\nsensitivity training but leaves much to be desired for many tutors who want\n\nthe chance to further develop their skills.\n\n  Other tutors complain that they are not given enough recognition\n\nfor the hard work and thoughtful assistance they provide for their peers.\n Since the tutoring at UMD is done on a strictly voluntary basis, it\n\nis important to keep the tutors relatively satisfied.\n If too many tutors come to the conclusion that they are not getting\n\nany benefit for their effort ( material or immaterial) there may be a problem\n\nwith recruiting enough tutors to supply the current demand.\n\n\n  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current method of\n\ntraining tutors in the UMD Achievement Center and determine if this status\n\nquo should be changed by implementing the College Reading and Learning\n\nAssociation 's program for national certification.\n An analysis into both the program 's positive and negative points will\n\nbe included as well as a recommendation for the best alternative at this\n\ntime.\n\n\n  In order to become familiar with the College Reading and Learning\n\nAssociation 's ( CRLA) program for certifying tutor training programs, I\n\nconsulted UMD Achievement Center staff member Paul Treuer.\n I used the outline for CRLA certification to develop a questionnaire\n\n( Appendix A) to distribute to present tutors to get their opinion on this\n\nproposed change both good and bad.\n\n  I have acquired knowledge of the present system of tutor training\n\nfirst-hand by going through the tutor training course in winter of 1993.\n Since then, I have been a business and economics tutor and have had\n\nthe chance to experience both the joys and the frustrations of peer tutoring.\n I have also spent past two quarters working at the reception desk in\n\nthe tutoring center doing such tasks as keeping track of the number of\n\ntutorials and providing information to new tutors.\n This experience has allowed me to identify both strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the present system.\n\n  Finally, I used secondary library research to see what other\n\nlearning centers find important when training new tutors and how they go\n\nabout developing their skills with the greatest success and the least\n\nresistance on the tutor 's part.\n\n\n  In order to determine which method of tutor training s most\n\nbeneficial, it is important to determine why tutor training is important to\n\nthe success of the overall tutoring program.\n\n  \" Research suggests.. that the effectiveness of peer tutoring\n\ndepends primarily on the type of training the tutors receive\" ( Deming 5).\n Just because a student is successful in a classroom does not\n\nautomatically mean they are prepared to start teaching this material to\n\nanother student.\n A tutor must be prepared to begin the tutoring experience before any\n\nsuccessful interaction can take place.\n Classroom training of tutors should include many aspects including\n\nthe following.\n\n  Tutors should become familiarized with the learning center system\n\nin order to become comfortable in the new environment and to learn general\n\npolicies and procedures of the center.\n This should include a tour of the tutoring center along with a\n\ndescription of all available reference materials.\n This is important to let the tutors know what they have to work with\n\nand what they may want to ask for for future reference.\n The sign in or other attendance measures should also be described to\n\nassure accurate bookkeeping of tutorials.\n\n  Tutors must also learn to become sensitive to the varied needs\n\nand abilities of others in the student body.\n They must learn to treat others equitably and fairly regardless of\n\nlearning level or background.\n Some important groups to focus on include nontraditional students,\n\nracial minorities, and people with physical or mental disabilities.\n Learning techniques for dealing with others fairly assures that no\n\nstudent seeking help is alienated.\n This keeps the tutoring center from being viewed in a negative\n\nlight.\n\n  One of the most important skills a tutor can learn is how to ask\n\nquestions.\n Learning what to ask, how to ask, and when to ask questions can make\n\nthe difference between a very successful and very unsuccessful tutor.\n Asking questions of the person seeking help allows that person to\n\nthink more about what their actual problem is.\n Questions can also be used to direct a student to the answer without\n\ncoming right out and saying it.\n This in turn teaches the student about the process of learning and\n\nhow to approach problems from a different angle.\n The tutor should also be asking him/herself questions constantly to\n\nstay involved in the situation and to anticipate future plans of action.\n\n\n  What do I think the tutee is sensing?\n What do I think the tutee is feeling?\n What do I think the tutee is thinking?\n Why do I think the tutee is here?\n What are his/her expectations?\n\n\n  By learning to ask these questions, a tutor becomes more prepared\n\nto handle different and varied situations in the tutoring process.\n Hardly any two tutorials are the same, and it is therefore very\n\nimportant for tutors to be trained to handle different situations.\n\n  Tutors must also have access to a structured environment where\n\nthey can continue to practice and expand their skills.\n This environment should include contact with the professors of their\n\nchosen tutoring field to provide links between learning mediums and to make\n\nsure that they are not working against each other.\n Contact with professors also keeps tutors up to date on changes that\n\nmay have been made in certain classes over time.\n\n\n  From the above paragraphs it becomes clear that there are many\n\ncriteria necessary for a successful tutor training program.\n Tutors must become familiar with tutoring environment.\n Tutors must become sensitive to varied needs of students.\n Tutors must learn questioning skills.\n Tutors must have continued contact with faculty and\n\nadministration.\n\n\n  The tutoring center at UMD has applied basically the same tutor\n\ntraining program from its inception and has worked satisfactorily for the\n\npast six years.\n The tutor training course ( SSP 3003) is a ten week classroom\n\nexperience instructed by Paul Treuer and Kathy Clark.\n The class lasts for two hours and is held one day a week in the\n\nAchievement Center at UMD.\n\n  This course is basically an introduction to one-on-one and small\n\ngroup tutoring, yet includes training in other areas.\n The general week-by-week schedule outline is as follows (\n\nCredit-Based Peer Tutoring, 21):\n\n \n\n  Week 2: What do I really know about my discipline and how did I\n\nlearn it?\n\n  Week 3: What values and ethics will be important to me as I\n\ntutor?\n\n \n\n \n\n  Week 6: What are some effective strategies for one-on-one\n\ntutoring?\n\n \n\n  Week 8: How might my tutee 's learning style differ from my\n\nown?\n\n  Week 9: How can I create a comfortable and equitable learning\n\nenvironment?\n\n \n\n  In addition to covering these topics during the quarter, tutors\n\nalso spend three hours a week in the tutoring center working with other\n\nstudents.\n This gives them the opportunity to apply their knowledge right from\n\nthe first week and they can come back to the next classroom discussion with\n\nproblems or successes to talk about.\n\n  Tutors are also required to keep a journal during the quarter\n\nwhich helps to solidify their experiences and frustrations as they encounter\n\ndifferent situations.\n This journal is the used as a source for a tutoring portfolio, which\n\nis a compilation of most of the tutors activities during the quarter\n\nincluding: statement of tutoring philosophy, tutoring responsibilities,\n\npersonal tutoring assessment along with ideas for improving effectiveness,\n\nreflective statements, and a case study of a chosen individual with whom the\n\ntutor has worked during the quarter.\n\n\n  Although the current situation meets most of the criteria\n\nnecessary for an effective training program, there are still some which need\n\nto be met.\n First of all, this program is limited in its time frame.\n One quarter is often times not long enough to learn all of the\n\nskills necessary to become a good tutor.\n While some tutors are happy to have their training complete in one\n\nquarter, others express that they would like to have extended training to\n\nwork on their skills while learning new ones.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

Valley.\n\n St. Patrick 's Church 724 Camp St., 529-3040.\n Services: weekdays, 11:30 & noon; Sat, 3:45 & 5 p.m.; Sun, 8:15,\n\n9:30& 11 a.m., 12:15 p.m.\n\n  St. Patrick 's was built in 1838 by Irish immigrants as an\n\nalternative to French Masses at St. Louis Cathedral.\n Architects Charles and James Dakin planned the current Gothic-style\n\nbuilding; however, the architect James Gatlief was called in to correct\n\nfoundation problems caused by swampy' soil.\n Gallier also designed the altar and much of the buttressed interior.\n The ceiling is patterned after that of Exeter Cathedral.\n The trio of huge oil paintings ( c.\n 1840) behind the altar by Leon Pomarede depict the Transfiguration,\n\nChrist Walking on the Water, and St. Patrick baptizing the princesses of\n\nIreland.\n Stained glass made by the Emile Frei Co. is grand, particularly that\n\nof the vaulted ceiling that fans out above the altar.\n\n St. Paul 's Episcopal 6249 Canal ( at Harrison), 488-3749.\n\n\n  Although the congregation dates from 1836, St. Paul 's Episcopal\n\nwas built in 1957.\n Many furnishings from the previous church, an 1893 structure on\n\nGaiennie Street, were brought to the present site, among them the lectern, an\n\nItalian marble communion table depicting the'Last Supper, the pews, pulpit,\n\naltar railings and marble baptismal font.\n Nine of the 14 windows are from the old church, including the\n\nAscension window, which at 29 by 16 feet is said to be among the largest in\n\nthe South.\n With the exception of a Tiffany Easter window, which is in storage,\n\nthe Franz Mayer Co. of Munich created the glasswork.\n Damaged by Hurricane Betsy in 1965, its panes were sent back to\n\nMunich, where they were repaired by men who'd 'dpprenticed with the famous\n\nglassmaker himself.\n\n St. Stephen 1025 Napoleon ( at Camp), 899-1378.\n Services: weekdays, 6:25 & 8:15 a.m.; Sat, 8:15 a.m.& 4 p.m.; Sun, 8\n\n& 10:30 a.m.\n\n  The second-largest Catholic church in the city, St. Stephen is a\n\nGerman Gothic structure built in 1871.\n The architect, Englishman Thomas Carter, also designed Our Lady of\n\nGood Counsel on Louisiana Avenue.\n Exterior points of interest include a six-sided tower- with the\n\nhighest spire in New' Orleans - as well as a roof with six gables on each\n\nside.\n Inside, a cypress-framed ceiling soars high above parishioners, and\n\ncherubim gaze down upon the nave.\n The double row of stained-glass windows are by Myers of Austria.\n The interior focus is on the aptly named \" Centerpiece of St.\n\nStephen,\" an 1869 painting by Achille Perertl that replicates Raphael 's \"\n\nStoning of St. Stephen.\" Other Peretti works on display include four panels\n\nand two frescoes.\n\n St. Vincent do Paul 3053 Dauphine St., 943-5566.\n\n\n  Established as a parish in 1838, the present building was\n\ndesigned by Louis Reynolds and built in 1866.\n The steeple and belltower were added in the early 1900s.\n Patterned in the Roman basilica style, the church contains 23\n\nextremely detailed stained-glass windows of French and American make, murals\n\npainted by artist Achille Peretti, one fresco and many statues.\n\n Salem United Church of Christ 4212 Camp St.(at Milan), 895-0392.\n\n\n  Built in 1905, this brick Gothic church was designed by Diboll\n\nand Owens.\n Memorial stained-glass windows created by German glassmakers Jacobi &\n\nCo. of St. Louis between 1907 and 1923 highlight this intimate space.\n Note the \" drapery glass,\" spots of raised, wavy glass that replicate\n\nripples in saints' robes in the texture of the window surface in a method\n\ndeveloped by Tiffany.\n The fleur-de-lis window in the balcony, as well as the glass in the\n\nbalcony stairway and above the entrances, created by Alfred Lipps Studio,\n\nwere added in the 1950s.\n\n Temple Sinai 6227 St. Charles Ave., 861-3693.\n\n\n  Temple Sinai, a Byzantine structure built in 1927, consists of a\n\nlovely chapel and an enormous yet elegant sanctuary.\n The chapel features an elaborate needle-point tapestry stitched by 24\n\nwomen of the congregation and depicting the Ten Commandments, the Menorah,\n\nHebrew verses and divine lights.\n Also in the chapel: a detailed stained-glass window made from glass\n\nsalvaged from the original Temple Sinai at Lee Circle and Carondelet Street.\n The sanctuary soars upward into carved wooden ceiling panels\n\naccented by Tiffany-esque lamps and bordered by huge arched walls.\n Stained glass depicts traditional Jewish symbols and ceremonies.\n\n Trinity Episcopal Church 1329 Jackson Ave.\n ( at Coliseum), 522-0276.\n\n\n  Built in 1852 by architect George Putyes, this pink Gothic\n\nRevival structure is a Garden District landmark.\n The present facade and tower were added in 1873.\n The stained-glass window above the altar was donated in memory of\n\nLeonidas Polk, first bishop of Louisiana, a brigadier general in the\n\nConfederate Army and rector of Trinity from 1855 to 1860. \n Unity Temple 3722 St. Charles Ave., 899 - 0715 or 8993390.\n\n\n  Built in 1960, the distinctive Unity Temple is one of the best\n\nexamples of Wrightian influence in New Orleans.\n The building was designed by Leonard R.\n Spangenberg, Jr., a student of Wright, with minister Ruth Elmer.\n The circular design within and without symbolizes eternity and\n\nechoes the Guggenheim Museum in New York.\n Entirely devoid of angles, the building is made of poured concrete\n\nand features circular skylights but no stained glass.\n Instead, the temple is illuminated by a band of Plexiglas windows.\n through a glass brightly Stained glass isn't \" stained\" by coloring\n\nagents at all.\n White light contains every color of the rainbow.\n To isolate co/ors, creating the stained effect, certain chemicals\n\nare added to the molten sand that is glass in its liquid form.\n The chemicals separate the colors - filtering out each color except\n\nthat of the final piece of glass.\n Because the coloring process is done with chemicals instead of\n\npigments, stained glass does not fade, even' over centuries.\n After the coloration process, the glasses blown into large\n\ncylinders, then cut in haft lengthwise, re-liquified and cooled in sheets.\n Artists and studios use these sheets to create stained-glass\n\ndesigns.\n When the subject for the window has been chosen, the artist makes a\n\ndesign from which a pattern is made showing the exact shapes and sizes of the\n\npieces of glass to be cut.\n The glass is cut to fit, allowing spaces for leading between the\n\npieces.\n Details of the design, such as facial features, drapery and\n\nornamental motifs are then painted on with enamel mixed with ground glass and\n\na temporary glue.\n then fired in a kiln.\n This makes the glass opaque, creating shadowy details such as facial\n\nfeatures and drapes in fabric.\n The artist fits lead around the pieces and solders the joints, then\n\nwaterproofs the work by applying putty solution beneath the leading.\n\n\n\n\n PHOTOS ( COLOR): Art at Myra Clare Rogers Memorial Chapel Includes a\n\nTiffany rose window ( above)

sense that you only get\n\none chance to take perfect shots of the event or you miss them.\n It takes a lot of practice and experience for someone to become a\n\nprofessional wedding photographer.\n The internet is teeming with wedding photography tips that will teach\n\nyou how to make memorable shots the bride and groom ( and also the guests)\n\nwould really love. \n\n  Chronicling one of the most significant moments of a couple is\n\ntaxing because it involves pressure from many people whether you are doing it\n\nprofessionally or for a friend.\n It is important to understand the needs of the subject even if some\n\nof the guests have the tendency to be complete smug.\n Part of the wedding photography tips given in this article involves\n\nthe proper attitude in the field.\n There would be instances that would require you to level down your\n\npride in the spirit of professionalism.\n Try to be polite and efficient by ignoring your own qualms.\n\n\n  Being professional means arriving on the field well-prepared.\n As soon as you close a deal with the client, start doing research on\n\nanything you need about the wedding.\n Spend time visiting the church and the reception.\n Find out the best way to get there on time.\n If possible, try to go to the location on the same time of the day as\n\nthe wedding event to familiarize your self with the lighting condition and to\n\nget ideas on how to position the couple during photo sessions. \n\n  You can find wedding photography tips on magazines and the\n\ninternet that specifically tackle various techniques on how to take candid\n\nshots, group photos, and portraits. \n\n  Sports photography is often deemed as pure form of photography.\n Sports photographers have to be skilled in capturing not only the\n\nstrength and skill of an athlete but also the underlying emotions and\n\nambiance found in a game.\n Sports photography tips given by experienced photographers are way\n\ndifferent from studio or nature photography.\n In sports photography you have to capture an eventful moment as it\n\nhappens because it does not rerun for you. \n\n  Timing is of the essence for a sports photographer.\n Other than that are the most basic elements of photography: light and\n\ncomposition, framing, content, etc.\n Emphasis on the subject is intense in sports photography.\n That is why professionals would usually give sports photography tips\n\nthat do not only involve the elements mentioned earlier.\n Aspiring sports photographers should also be knowledgeable of the\n\ngame they are shooting.\n This would help them anticipate the momentous shots, the winning\n\ngoals, the passion of the athletes.\n They have to know what might happen to the game.\n Sports photography is both mental and physical.\n\n\n  There are no schools that offer professional degrees in sports\n\nphotography but there are workshops you can attend.\n From there, you will get to meet with professional photographers and\n\nhobbyists who can be your potential mentors.\n Nonetheless, you can obtain plenty of sports photography tips on the\n\ninternet and by looking at the photographs in sports magazines. \n\n  Best of all, you have to practice as much as you can.\n Look at sports photographs in the newspapers and magazines and try to\n\nfind the elements that made them stunning.\n Try these techniques on any sports event in your community.\n Volunteer as the official photographer for your friend 's kid who is\n\njoining the little league.\n Go back to your high school to watch one of their football games.\n There are many athletes out there waiting for someone to chronicle\n\ntheir games.\n You might easily be that person they are waiting for if you will just\n\ngrab the opportunity. \n\n  It is quite difficult to imagine if there is anything else the\n\nbest digital camera in the world cannot do.\n Photography has become just as regular a hobby as watching TV\n\nnowadays especially when you get to share photos with family and friends as\n\neasy as uploading a whole album to your Facebook account.\n But for professional photographers, today 's technology still has some\n\nlimitations that are not very easily resolved.\n This involves dynamic photography which is popular among landscape\n\nphotographers. \n\n  Dynamic photography focus on capturing the different range of\n\nbrightness levels existing in a scene, more specifically, landscapes.\n A landscape photograph seems dull if the photographer is unable to\n\ncapture the darkest and the lightest part of the subject.\n The challenge in landscape photography is to be able to concentrate\n\nthe eyes of a spectator inside the photograph.\n Dull landscape photographs tend to bleed through the edges of the\n\nphotograph too abruptly.\n\n\n  Dynamic photographers should improve how they handle composition\n\nby scrupulously framing the subject.\n To achieve this, the camera is being held with the flash turned off.\n Dynamic photography requires precision when it comes to timing.\n If a landscape photographer needs to wait the whole day for the best\n\nexposure, he or she does so to achieve the effect he or she wanted.\n However, there are some who would rather rely on equipment to get the\n\nsame result.\n Professional photographers would use two to three stop blocking\n\nfilters to block the part of the landscape that receives too much brightness.\n By experimenting on blocking filters, you will be able to create\n\nphotos that truly encompass the lines and colors of the landscape.\n You may have to master other photography techniques before jumping\n\ninto the dynamic photography bandwagon as it tends to be more technical and\n\ndemanding.\n Digital Photography Techniques vs. Digital Photography\n\nEquipments\n\n  The usual misconception that entry level photo hobbyists have is\n\nthat they need a better camera to take better photographs.\n This is not necessarily true.\n Even the oldest model of a point-and-shoot camera can take better\n\nphotos if the photographer knows some basic digital photography techniques.\n At the same time, the owner of the most expensive digital SLR is\n\nwasting his or her time without knowing how to take pictures properly. \n\n  If you have just started with photography, upgrading your\n\npoint-and-shoot camera right away is not required.\n You do not need to rush to a professional photography shop and\n\nimmediately swipe your credit card for that high-end digital SLR.\n It is better to hone your skills with a point-and-shoot camera before\n\nbuying a new one.\n Again, it is all about digital photography techniques and not the\n\nequipments.\n Do not push your budget to the limit.\n Once you are ready for an upgrade, you can even buy cheaper cameras\n\nby buying previously owned cameras on mint condition.\n There are also gadget shops that allow you to exchange your\n\npoint-and-shoot for an entry level digital SLR for an additional cost.\n Otherwise, if you do not have a camera yet, opt for a secondhand\n\nentry level digital SLR that usually costs almost the same as a brand new\n\npoint-and-shoot camera. \n\n  It is not about the features of the camera anyway but how you are\n\ncapable of maximizing these features to create acceptable photographs.\n Before actually learning digital photography techniques elsewhere,\n\nyou have to get to know your camera by reading the instruction manuals with\n\nthe gadget on hand.\n Try to take the same subjects with different modes and effects to\n\nfind out how to use each button.\n The rest will follow once you have mastered handling your camera.\n\n\n\n  The saying that photographers make great photographs and not the\n\ncamera rings true.\n There are people who can only afford a point-and-shoot digital camera\n\nand yet are able take stunning shots.\n There are some who gets to flash their bulky digital SLRs and yet\n\ntheir outputs fail to give justice to the gadget.\n What the latter lack is not inborn artistry but the efforts to hone\n\ntheir photography skills.\n They might have ignored a digital photography guide they have seen in\n\nsome website thinking that their high-end SLR would do the trick for them.\n\n\n\n  These people are awfully mistaken.\n How can you take great photos with a great camera if you do not even\n\nknow how to use its special features because you simply do not know anything\n\nabout basic photography?\n Following tips and techniques from various sources that have a\n\ndigital photography guide is the second step in your research.\n The first one is studying the manual by heart.\n Grab your camera and try what those buttons can do on similar\n\nsubjects.\n That way, you get to learn how to use different camera modes for\n\ndifferent subjects and locations.\n You have to practice how to control exposure and lighting and most\n\nimportantly, how to use the flash.\n All these can be found in a reliable digital photography guide found\n\non the internet. \n\n  Being able to produce great outputs is rewarding especially if\n\nyou have really given it enough efforts.\n There is what we call beginner\"s luck in photography.\n All amateur photographers should get pass through that stage,\n\nforward, and not the other way around.\n\n\n\n  Interested in school photography tips?\n School activities are as worthy of a scrapbook page as birthday\n\nparties or weddings.\n Children and young adults spend most of their time in school.\n There would come a time when you may have to tell something about\n\nyour past and by then, it is inevitable that your memories about school is\n\nthe first thing you would think of.\n Always carrying a camera around is never enough.\n Although it is probably the most important lesson among track loads\n\nof school photography tips professional photographers would give you, being\n\ntrigger-happy with your camera is not the best way to learn how to take that\n\nmemorable shot. \n\n  It is important to plan ahead especially if you are going to\n\ndocument school-related events.\n Planning does not only mean packing your cameras, tripods, batteries\n\nand other equipments.\n You also have to prepare the clothes you are going to wear, decide\n\nand practice the shots you wanted to make or how you wanted your schoolmates\n\nto pose for you on portraits.\n Searching the internet for school photography tips is one way to\n\nenhance your amateur shots. \n\n  Another thing you have to consider is how to make your subjects\n\ncomfortable during photo sessions.\n Remember that your friends and teachers have different\n\npersonalities.\n Some of them still need a little propping before they get to flash\n\nthose celebrity smiles.\n Others tend to dominate the whole shot which should not be the\n\neffect you wanted for your photographs.\n You have to decide the location of the photo shoot with your\n\nsubjects in mind.\n Make sure that every shot you make has a theme.\n The shots you take along the school corridor are different from the\n\nones you take in the cafeteria.\n Any person who gets to see the photographs would immediately notice\n\nthe distinction. \n\n  Professional photographers and hobbyists would give you school\n\nphotography tips that are not just related to creating beautiful pictures.\n The more important thing is to make them meaningful may they be\n\nportraits or candid shots.\n Practice improves your ability to choose which shots look good and\n\nwhich are not.\n That is why it is advised that you try to take photographs all\n\nthroughout the school year.\n Many point-and-shoot digital camera owners are now starting to\n\nreplace their old ones with an entry-level digital SLR.\n This seems to be an inevitable trend.\n The more one uses his or her camera, the more skilled he or she\n\nbecomes.\n In the end, he or she would demand for a better digital photography\n\nequipment that best suits his or her newfound skill.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f3c09880-242b-48ec-ad60-7af7a02df7db", "added":

Now that they've begun 'vee fighting, I just want\n\nit to be overwith as soon as possible.\n And from what \" they\" ( related to \" the guy\") say, our forces are\n\nonly taking out strategic military-related stuff in Iraq.\n Hopefully, \" they\" are right.\n I don't see the need for massacre or anything.\n But like I was saying to - - - ( remember her!\n ) last night, I feel generally ignorant to all the details and\n\ntwists in this conversation about the \" war\" so I'd rath 'd not contribute to\n\nmeaningless discussion, know what I mean, until I'm adequa 'mly versed enought\n\nto be truly meaningless. \n\n  So.\n I'm glad t 'mhear that the hatemongers have eased up on you and that\n\nthings are going well for you and your woman.\n Smitten.

{"text": "This organism is a \" great simulator,\" yet when you follow its\n\ndevelopmental life cycle through all its transitional stages using darkfield\n\nmicroscopic analysis of live blood, \" it can be identified as a single\n\nagent,\" stated Dr. Livingston.\n She never claimed to be the first discoverer of P. cryptocides, noting\n\nthat it has been \" an unclassified mystery\" periodically rediscovered since\n\nthe early 1800s. \n\n  Despite the laboratory work, the photos of P. cryptocides from\n\nlive blood, the scientific papers and books, Dr. Livingston 's cancer microbe\n\nremains \" the most closeted achievement of our century,\" Dr. Cantwell\n\ncontends.\n \" Her findings today mean nothing to oncologists.\n Her discoveries don't exist.\n How can they credit bacteria seen in living blood when they consider\n\nblood to be sterile?\" \n\n  In 1974, Dr. Livingston discoverd that the cancer microbe secretes\n\na hormone called choriogonadotropin ( CG), that is a cell growth regulator\n\nsimiliar to human growth hormone secreted by the brain.\n \" Unless CG is controlled by antibodies, white cells, and dietary\n\nfactors, it can continue its reproductive activity indefinitely in an\n\nuncontrolled way,\" she said.\n CG protects the growing tumor from ingestion by the immune system.\n\n\n\n  Further, Dr. Livingston claimed that the cancer microbe is\n\npresent inside sperm cells and, at conception, it releases the CG hormone to\n\nprotect the fertilized egg.\n It does this because otherwise at least half of fetal cells would be\n\nregarded by the body as foreign and it would seek to destroy them.\n With this new biological understanding of the cancer process, Dr.\n\nLivingston went on to develop a practical, nontoxic approach.\n In general, she Dr. Cantwell ruled out surgery because it would be\n\nimpossible admits that it to remove all cancerous tissues as the disease is\n\nmight have been systemic.\n Also, \" extensive mutilating surgery\" premature for would help spread\n\nthe cancer by shocking the adrenal glands and further weakening the immune\n\nsystem which would now have to aid the body in healing from the surgery in\n\naddition to continuing to resist the cancer.\n However, Dr. Livingston advised having surgery to remove the tumor\n\nload if it could be easily removed without mutilation of the patient. \n\n  A better approach, she proposed, would be to support the immune\n\nsystem, increase the body 's Staphylococcus resistance, and suppress the\n\nspecific cancer microbe by eliminating the internal bodily conditions that\n\nenable it to thrive.\n A prime way to accomplish this, said Dr. Livingston, is through the\n\nuse of specifically targeted vaccines, especially one prepared and precisely\n\ntailored from the patient 's own P. cryptocides. \n\n  Such a vaccine focuses on more than cancer--it addresses the\n\nentire immune system.\n This perspective came in handy in the late 1960s when an FDA official\n\ntold Dr. Livingston she vaccinate could not treat cancer with vaccines.\n \" I assured him I was not treating cancer with vaccines but that I am\n\nusing autogenous [ 'self-made,' from the patient 's own cultured P.\n\ncryptocides] vaccines obtained from the patient 's own tissues and bodily\n\nfluids to treat an underlying chronic infection.\" \n\n  It 's no different in 1997, says the Center 's medical director,\n\nMark H. LaBeau, D.O.\n The Center bills itself as specializing in the treatment of \"\n\nimmuno-deficiency\" diseases.\n As it turns out, about 95% of their patients are people with cancer.\n \" We work with people and their weakened immune systems,\" he says.\n The Livingston approach consists of multiple vaccines, dietary and\n\nnutritional programs, and psychological counseling.\n According to Dr. LaBeau, among the cancer cases, the Center tends to\n\nget the best results with cancers of the breast, prostate, and colon, and\n\nlymph system. \n\n\n  This phase of the Livingston program consists of six vaccines,\n\nseveral of them patented by Dr. Livingston.\n Their purpose is to stimulate production of antibodies to control the\n\nspread of P. cryptocides, raise the white blood cell count and\n\ndisease-resisting potential of patients, stimulate key immune system cells (\n\nnatural killer and B cells), and support the immune system in functioning\n\nmore efficiently, says Dr. LaBeau.\n \" Dr. Livingston found that when you use these six vaccines together\n\nyou get a compounding effect and better results.\" \n\n  Vaccine A--Here the cancer microbe itself is collected from the\n\npatient 's own P. cryptocides, cultured overnight at room temperature in the\n\nlaboratory, then filtered, concentrated, and injected into the muscle as a\n\nvaccine.\n The purified bacteria acts as an irritant ( antigen) that provokes\n\nthe immune system to respond to it and produce antibodies ( specialized\n\ndefense proteins) against it. \n\n  Vaccine B--This vaccine is prepared and purified from \" killed\" (\n\nsterilized) bacteria cultured from the P. cryptocides of a patient who has\n\nsuccessfully overcome the cancer microbe. \n\n  BCG Vaccine--The Bacillus Calmette-Gu}rin uses highly weakened\n\ntuberculosis ( TB) microbes to evoke a strong immune response against cancer.\n The BCG vaccine has been commonly used against TB since its\n\nintroduction in 1921.\n BCG is effective against cancer ( as a \" protective\" factor) because\n\nDr. Livingston 's research showed that its structure is highly similar to that\n\nof P. cryptocides.\n \" When the immune system is stimulated with BCG to react to\n\ntuberculosis bacteria, it is also stimulated to cross-react to P.\n\ncryptocides,\" says Dr. LaBeau. \n\n  Gamma Globulin--This is a conventional vaccine substance\n\nconsisting of five different types of specialized proteins or antibodies (\n\ncalled immunoglobulins) normally found in healthy blood.\n Gamma globulin helps the immune system resist infection by supplying\n\nit with more of the body 's basic disease-resisting substances. \n\n  Vaccine C--This vaccine combines purified glandular extracts of\n\nsheep thymus and spleen to support the immune activities of both organs.\n The thymus gland, located behind the sternum in the chest, produces\n\nimmune cells called T lymphocytes or T cells; this gland also secretes a\n\nhormone that controls the growth and maturation of these cells.\n The spleen produces T cells and cleanses the blood by removing\n\nparasites among the red blood cells. \n\n  Generally, a large dose of vitamin B-12 ( 1 cc) is added to\n\nVaccine C as a nutritional supplement because a vegetarian diet is deficient\n\nin this vitamin.\n It 's given in an injectable form because it is better absorbed than\n\nin an oral form. \n\n  Vaccine D--Using an extract of white blood cells, this vaccine is\n\ninjected into the patient to stimulate their own T cells, Dr. LaBeau\n\nexplains. \n\n  Other Vaccines--Livingston physicians occasionally use MRV, or\n\nmixed respiratory vaccine, which contains common respiratory bacteria.\n For selected patients, depending on their tumor type, they may also\n\nemploy interferon, immune proteins produced by white blood cells against\n\nviruses, given in extremely small doses as an additional immune response\n\nbooster. \n\n  Livingston patients typically receive all six vaccines at the\n\nsame time, three times weekly.\n This schedule is usually maintained for the first year or until a\n\nremission is achieved; after this, the patient is likely to receive only\n\nthree or four of the vaccines.\n As a protective measure, after remission, vaccines are ideally\n\nadministered on a less frequent basis for the rest of the person 's life.\n As the Livingston Center is an exclusively outpatient facility with\n\nan initial ten-day program, patients are instructed in self-administering the\n\ninjections at home ( with the exception of BCG). \n\n\n  \" One of the most vital systems of the body that cannot be\n\nsustained by devitalized, dead food is the immune system,\" said Dr.\n\nLivingston.\n In addition to dietary guidance, each patient receives an\n\nindividually tailored nutritional protocol consisting of, potentially, almost\n\n40 different supplements.\n\n\n  Dietary Recommendations--First off, avoid all poultry products,\n\nincluding chicken and eggs, advises Livingston Center 's staff nutritionist\n\nJanet Zuckerman, B.S.\n She notes that the primary reason for including or eliminating foods\n\nis their likely effect on the cancer microbe. \n\n  In most cases, patients should eliminate fish, pork, beef, veal,\n\nand most dairy products from the diet, too, relying primarily on vegetarian\n\nprotein sources.\n Living fresh foods, such as nonprocessed whole grains and beans and\n\norganically raised fruits and vegetables, are recommended.\n The diet also calls for avoiding fluoridated water, alcohol, soft\n\ndrinks, tobacco, chemical ingredients, and sugar-based foods. \n\n  Abscisic Acid--This natural component of vitamin A is the\n\nfoundation upon which all cancer immunity is built because it \" actually\n\nstops cancer cells from multiplying\" and is \" nature 's most potent anticancer\n\nweapon,\" explained Dr. Livingston.\n Abscisic acid is found in small amounts in raw yellow vegetables (\n\nnotably carrots), nuts, seeds, and certain vitamin A rich fruits ( mangoes,\n\ngrapes, pears, apples).\n Abscisic acid is believed to decrease the secretion of the growth\n\nhormone found in tumor cells. \n\n  Dr. Livingston synthesized an abscisic acid formula called CIS 14\n\nwhich is available as a supplement only to Livingston Center patients.\n\n\n  Vitamins--For the first 30 days of their treatment, cancer\n\npatients take 20 drops ( 5,000 IUs per drop) daily of vitamin A mixed into\n\nfreshly pulped carrot juice, and at least 400 IUs of vitamin E.\n They also get 8-10 g of vitamin C, in divided doses ( although doses\n\nup to 40 g daily may be given, usually intravenously), and a complete\n\nvitamin, mineral, and trace element package in the form of Daily Care(tm), a\n\nformula developed by the Livingston Center. \n\n  Digestive Supports--Enzymes are given to Livingston Center\n\npatients to facilitate better digestion of foods as are supplements of \"\n\nfriendly bacteria\" such as L. acidophilus and L. bifidus to improve\n\nintestinal activity. \n\n  Lymph System Stimulation--As an osteopath, Dr. LaBeau is keenly\n\nattuned to the status of the patient 's lymph system, knowing that its\n\nefficient drainage and removal of toxins from the body is crucial to\n\nrestoring health.\n He notes that about 30% of his cancer patients have a musculoskeletal\n\nproblem ( as evidenced by restricted movement) at the direct site of the\n\ntumor, such as the pelvis or breast, and that another 30% have similar\n\nproblems near key lymph drainage and immune function sites. \n\n  In these cases, Dr. LaBeau either provides the patient with\n\nosteopathic manipulation during their ten-day program, or makes a referral\n\nfor more long-term treatment.\n In either event, the goal, he says, is to remove the musculoskeletal\n\nand lymph interference which, in turn, helps the body use the other program\n\ncomponents to eliminate the cancer. \n\n\n  \" The Livingston Center believes that mental attitude can have a\n\nprofound impact on the effective treatment and continued good health of a\n\npatient,\" explains clinical director and staff psychologist Robert Barrett,\n\nPh.D. \n\n  Since patients do not reside at the Livingston Center, there is\n\nnot enough time for Dr. Barrett to do in-depth counseling.\n However, he introduces patients to both the theoretical and practical\n\nsides of how their emotions and stress levels interact with their immune\n\nsystem and its ability to restore health. \n\n  Typically, during his series of one-hour classes, Dr. Barrett\n\nexplains the benefits and techniques of stress reduction, progressive muscle\n\nrelaxation, visualizations, meditation, lifestyle changes, ways of coping and\n\npositive attitude-building.\n \" I look for situations or concerns they may have to face when they\n\nreturn home.\n The goal is to help the person restructure the way they see their\n\nsituation, to show them what a different emotional response might lead to,\"\n\nsays Dr. Barrett. \n\n  \" One thing that stresses many patients is the assumption that\n\nbecause they have cancer they should be thinking about death,\" he says.\n \" They may be rehearsing the thought continually in their mind that\n\ncancer is a killer.\n I suggest to them that, yes, getting cancer is a wake-up call to\n\nreconsider many things, yet many people survive cancer, and that the more\n\npositive their attitude is about surviving, the more likely it is that this\n\nwill help their healing process.\" \n\n\n  Today, Dorothy, 73, is free of cancer.\n When she came to the Livingston Center 12 years ago with a diagnosis\n\nof colon cancer, the prognosis was not good.\n Two years earlier, she had undergone surgery to remove the cancerous\n\npart of her colon and at that time there was no evidence the cancer had\n\nspread elsewhere in her body.\n But in October 1985, Dorothy had a CT scan that indicated her cancer\n\nhad spread to the right lobe of her liver and to her pancreas. \n\n  At the time of her arrival at the Livingston Center a month\n\nlater, Dorothy reported she had lost 22 pounds in the previous three months,\n\nand had been suffering from nausea, lower abdominal cramps, and intractable\n\nlower back pain.\n This last symptom had developed as a result of having been struck by\n\na car nine years earlier. \n\n  \" The motor vehicle accident is pertinent to Dorothy 's cancer,\"\n\nsays Dr. LaBeau, \" because she required multiple surgeries and transfusions\n\nof 11 pints of blood.\n These 11 different sources of blood basically introduced 11 more\n\nsources of potential infection by P. cryptocides.\" \n\n  Other than the previous colon surgery, the Livingston program was\n\nthe first course of cancer therapy Dorothy received.\n During the initial ten-day program, she began the vaccine series,\n\nintravenous vitamin C and B complex, specialized diet, and other supplements\n\n\" to reduce the amount of the cancer microbe and to enhance immune\n\nfunctioning,\" Dr. LaBeau says.\n She also attended the Center 's classes on stress management, coping\n\nstrategies, and techniques for dealing with cancer with a positive and\n\noptimistic attitude. \n\n  In April 1987, Dorothy was reevaluated.\n She reported that her only complaint was abdominal distress from the\n\ndietary changes.\n A CT scan showed a cyst on her right kidney but no signs of cancer in\n\nher liver, pancreas, or spleen.\n Over the last ten years, says Dr. LaBeau, Dorothy has continued with\n\nthe Livingston program and returned once yearly for a checkup.\n Her lower back pain continued because she declined to undergo the\n\nrecommended osteopathic treatment. \n\n  All clinical signs, such as urine analysis and blood\n\nchemistries, are within normal limits and Dorothy shows \" no clinical\n\nevidence of malignant disease,\" says Dr. LaBeau.",

{"text": "The widespread encouragement that Colin Powell is receiving for\n\nmaking a run for the White House says more about some people 's yearning for a\n\nmessiah figure to deliver us from our collective sins, from racism to crime,\n\nthan it does about reality.\n It also says something about our willingness ( and the willingness of\n\nthose who want Powell to be president in order to advance their own careers)\n\nto ignore unpleasant truths about the man with the golden image.\n\n \n For instance, look at the memorandum that House Speaker Newt Gingrich\n\nrequested from University of Texas Professor Marvin Olasky on \" The Powell I\n\nCould Not Support - And The Powell I Could.\n\n\n \n Olasky, who has contributed much intellectual substance to the\n\nRepublican plan to overhaul welfare, hopes that Powell may not be a closet\n\nliberal and, though pro-choice on abortion, ( ITAL) could ( unITAL) be\n\npersuaded to speak and act in ways that would reduce the number of abortions.\n He also believes that if Powell were to become president, he might use\n\nthe \" bully pulpit\" and the Department of Education to push abstinence so\n\nthat fewer teen-agers would get pregnant in the first place.\n But a pro-life candidate could do the same with far more conviction.\n\n\n\n \n Why, it must be asked, would voters consider a man untested in\n\npolitics to be their president?\n If Bob Dole or Phil Gramm announced they wanted to be chairman of the\n\nJoint Chiefs, would anyone take them seriously?\n\n\n  Five years ago, few outside the Washington foreign policy\n\ncommunity had heard of Colin Powell.\n He was just another military bureaucrat.\n The Persian Gulf War changed that, but Powell emerged from that\n\nconflict with more stars than he deserved.\n\n \n The record shows that in every Gulf planning session, Gen. Powell\n\nraised the possibility of an American blood bath and urged President Bush to\n\nuse economic sanctions, not troops, to thwart Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein 's\n\ninvasion of Kuwait.\n When Bush overruled him, Powell devised a plan of attack for the U.N.\n\nforces that was vintage World War I \" over the top\" stuff.\n Norman Schwarzkopf was so opposed that he threatened to resign if\n\nforced to implement it.\n Assistant Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger called the Powell\n\nplan the real recipe for an American bloodbath.\n\n \n In an apparent attempt to cover himself, Powell called in The\n\nWashington Post 's Bob Woodward on the eve of Bush 's fateful moment.\n He told Woodward of his deep misgivings about the Bush strategy for\n\nrepelling Saddam 's aggression and relayed his own belief in economic\n\nsanctions.\n\n \n Schwarzkopf and Bush were vindicated by America 's finest military\n\nhour since World War Two.\n When Woodward 's book, \" The Commanders,\" was published, it told of\n\nPowell 's opposition to Bush 's military decisions.\n Worse, we learned that Powell had positioned himself so that he could\n\nhave wiggled out of any responsibility should the war have gone badly.\n It would have been said that Bush overruled the professional advice\n\nof his Joint Chiefs chairman.\n But to liberals in congress, Powell would have been a hero.\n By speaking out of turn to Woodward, Powell was disloyal to his\n\ncommander in chief.\n\n \n Liberal journalists see Powell as the anti-revolutionary who could\n\nbeat back the voters' intentions expressed in the 1994 election.\n Powell himself has called the Contract With America \" harsh and\n\npunitive.\n \" But who knows where this man who is so adept at flip-flopping\n\nreally stands?\n As he writes in his book, he started out as a center-leftist.\n But, after declaring himself pro-choice and for affirmative action\n\nand for the Million Man March, within days he changed to \" generally in line\n\nwith the Christian right\" and questioned the leadership of the march.\n\n \n Powell could fill an important role as a racial healer while speaking\n\nout for abstinence and personal responsibility.\n He could do this in the House or Senate, as a governor, a university\n\npresident, or in private life.\n But if he chooses to run for President and appears to be a front man\n\nfor convictionless \" Rockefeller Republicans,\" who lack a viable candidate,\n\nhe will open himself up to attacks on his record in the military and his\n\nself-serving confessional to Bob Woodward.\n That will begin a battle he cannot win and he will be a candidate for\n\nwhom most social conservatives cannot and will not vote.\n HEADLINE: SEARCH FOR TRUTH, EXTRA VIGILANCE ARE PROPER RESPONSE\n\nTO DERAILMENT\n\n \n FBI agents, police, politicians and the American people should beware\n\na rush to judgment about what kind of person or group might have derailed a\n\ntrain in the Arizona desert, why they did it and what needs to be done about\n\nit.\n Leaping to conclusions can lead to miscalculations that threaten the\n\ninnocent and hinder the search for truth.\n\n \n Remember the widespread speculation blaming the April 19 Oklahoma\n\nCity Federal building bombing on Arab terrorists from overseas?\n Careful investigation led to charges against a couple of disgruntled\n\nanti-government loners, both non-Arab Americans.\n\n \n Congress should not let the derailment pressure them into approving\n\nany anti-terrorism laws that threaten civil liberties.\n\n \n FBI agents and police must keep their minds open, uniting their full\n\nresources to bring the sick, cowardly perpetrators of this despicable,\n\nmurderous crime to justice.\n To boost deterrence, Amtrak is rightly stepping up recautions at\n\ntrain stations and increasing surveillance along the tracks. \n\n \n Americans whose sense of security has been shaken should take some\n\ncomfort from knowing law enforcement agencies have a good track record in\n\nrecent years in catching people who commit such crimes.\n\n \n Could the derailment be organized anti-government terrorism?\n Possibly.\n The main clue, a note signed by \" Sons of Gestapo\" could be genuine.\n But it also could be a red herring to distract the FBI from the real\n\nsaboteurs and their motives.\n\n \n Could it be vandalism that got out of hand or a psycho 's way of\n\ncausing mindless destruction?\n\n \n Or could it be a disgruntled Amtrak employee or ex-employee with a\n\ngrudge against his bosses?\n The saboteur clearly had an insider 's knowledge of how to avoid\n\ntriggering an electronic warning signal.\n\n \n Until more information is known, avoid leaping to premature\n\nconclusions.\n\n \n So far, it 's clearcut sabotage and murder, motivation uncertain.\n There 's a big leap from that to organized terrorism, although the\n\nvictims may find the distinction mere nit-picking.\n MAKE STUDY OF LEGALIZED GAMBLING TO BE SURE REGULATION MEETS\n\nNEED\n\n \n Congress should move swiftly to create a proposed national commission\n\nto study the enormously destructive impacts of legalized gambling and\n\nrecommend ways to reduce that harm.\n\n \n The major threat is a severe psychological illness called gambling\n\naddiction, no less real than addiction to alcohol or drugs.\n More than 10.6 million Americans ( 1.3 million teen-agers) are\n\nestimated victims, 400,000 in Florida.\n\n \n Compulsive gamblers chasing elusive jackpots and an artificial \"\n\nhigh\" gamble away billions needed for rent, groceries, utilities, child\n\nsupport and other necessities of life.\n Some people write bad checks, engage in fraud or embezzlement, borrow\n\nfrom loansharks at exorbitant interest rates or steal to feed their habit.\n\n\n \n Research shows gambling generally has its most harmful impact on\n\nthose who can least afford it, the poor.\n A steady increase in casino gambling by teen-agers, despite legal\n\nbans, is cause for alarm in part because it encourages them to regularly\n\nengage in illegal behavior. \n\n \n Casinos promise huge economic benefits, then cannibalize the local\n\neconomy because free or low-cost meals, drinks and hotel rooms force\n\ncompetitors out of business.\n\n \n In gambling towns, rates of desertion, personal bankruptcy, divorce,\n\nmental illness and suicide are far higher than elsewhere. \n\n \n Gambling erodes moral standards by fueling unhealthy attitudes: You\n\ncan get something for nothing.\n You don't need the self-discipline to study or work hard to achieve\n\nsuccess, just bet on random events, mostly beyond human control.\n\n \n In places like Atlantic City, casinos have propelled a huge rise in\n\nproperty values, driving longtime business and home owners away.\n They also brought more crime such as prostitution, money-laundering,\n\nloan-sharking, mob infiltration and political corruption.\n\n \n Gambling is big business.\n Nationwide, gamblers bet half a trillion dollars a year, and lose\n\n&dollar; 40 billion.\n Legalized gambling, once rare, is now proliferating: 37 states,\n\nincluding Florida, have state-run lotteries and 23 states, not including\n\nFlorida, allow casinos.\n Florida allows gambling at horse and dog tracks and jai alai\n\nfrontons.\n Casinos are located on cruise ships that sail three miles offshore.\n A proposed state constitutional amendment legalizing casinos in\n\nFlorida is heading for the November 1996 ballot.</P> <p.\n An honest, independent study of the true national impacts of\n\nlegalized gambling could be a real eye-opener.\n\n \n It is unlikely that the federal government would ever ban legalized\n\ngambling, given its popularity.\n At least, a study commission could provide guidelines to improve\n\ngambling regulation and offer some shocking public education to help gambling\n\naddicts and others learn to resist the siren 's song of the sucker bet.\n DURENBERGER, REYNOLDS FIND OUT HARD WAY THEY AREN'T ABOVE THE\n\nLAW\n\n \n Among the many faults of Congress, in the minds of an increasingly\n\nannoyed public, is insufferable personal arrogance.\n Although some members of Congress maintain a level outlook, others\n\nfall under the self-induced spell they'r 'reither above the law or simply not\n\ngoverned by rules affecting everyone else.\n\n \n When a couple of these arrogant scoundrels are brought to heel, as\n\nDave Durenberger and Mel Reynolds were this week, public reaction can be\n\nmixed.\n The satisfaction of knowing they' 'llbe punished for their violations\n\nis dulled by the confirmation of long-suspected wrongdoing.\n We' 'reglad they were caught, but wonder how many of their colleagues\n\nare getting away with similar criminal or unethical acts. \n\n \n Durenberger, of Minnesota, no longer in the U.S. Senate, has long\n\ninsisted he committed no crime in his unusual expense account claims.\n Finally, in a transparent attempt to avoid a felony conviction and\n\nprobable prison time, Durenberger admitted five misdemeanor charges of\n\nstealing public money by abusing his expense account.\n\n \n \" Stealing\" is precisely correct.\n Durenberger would stay in a Minneapolis condominium he owned, then\n\nbill the taxpayers as if he had rented a hotel room.\n He admitted running up\n\n&dollar; 3,825 in bogus expense items and expects to be punished lightly by getting\n\nprobation. \n\n \n Under federal sentencing guidelines, he could be imprisoned for 10\n\nmonths, but why be vindictive?\n Durenberger, a Republican, has been cut down to his tiny size.\n The Senate denounced him, he lost his law license and was forced out\n\nof office.\n\n \n That 's enough.\n Durenberger, 61, never again will be a factor in public life, nor\n\nshould he be.\n\n \n Reynolds, a Chicago Democrat and current member of the House, almost\n\ncertainly will spend time in prison after his jury conviction on 12 criminal\n\ncharges.\n The conviction of criminal sexual assault alone requires a four-year\n\nmandatory minimum sentence.\n\n \n The jury refused to buy his claim that he had \" phone sex\" with a\n\n16-year-old girl, but nothing else.\n The testimony against Reynolds was too convincing, and the jury\n\nobviously was disgusted with a person in a position of authority using his\n\npower on a teen-ager, even if she consented to their sordid sexual\n\nrelationship.\n\n \n No role model for anyone despite his Ivy League and Rhodes Scholar\n\nbackground, Reynolds also was convicted of child pornography, sexual abuse\n\nand obstruction of justice.\n The jury concluded he tried to pressure the star witness against him\n\nto leave town.\n\n \n Unless his appeal unexpectedly succeeds, Reynolds at 43 also seems\n\ndestined to be a nonentity in public life.\n Shed no tears for him or Durenberger.\n In their rotten cases, arrogance brought its own reward by bringing\n\nthem down.\n\n \n It would be comforting to believe no one else in Congress is\n\nbehaving in similar unlawful ways.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "397a353a-bf9b-4a14-b0df-c60811203772",

{"text": "Melding modern computer technology with a time-proven optical\n\nsystem makes for an exciting way to explore the heavens.\n\n  Computerized telescopes have been the hot ticket in recent years.\n Celestron International created the first commercial computerized\n\nSchmidt-Cassegrain in 1987.\n The Compustar 8 was a pioneering model that could automatically slew\n\nto thousands of objects but only after being precisely polar aligned.\n A new model from Celestron, capable of finding and tracking targets\n\nwithout needing to be polar aligned, has been a long time coming.\n But it is here now--the Ultima 2000 8-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain.\n I tested one of the first production models, which was purchased by\n\nmail order from a major national dealer.\n\n  While flashy electronic features grab the initial attention of\n\nbuyers, sharp images and a solid mounting make a telescope a pleasure to use\n\nyear after year.\n In its advertising Celestron promises that the optics of its\n\nSchmidt-Cassegrains are \" guaranteed to be diffraction limited.\"\n Anything less and stars will look soft and planets will never snap\n\nwith sharp detail.\n\n  At high power, 2nd- and 3rd-magnitude stars showed distinct Airy\n\ndisks surrounded by a bright, well-defined first diffraction ring and fainter\n\nsecond and third rings.\n Diffraction patterns looked smooth and similar on either side of\n\nfocus, revealing only a low level of spherical aberration from what appeared\n\nto be a mild zonal error.\n The optics showed little evidence of surface roughness and no sign of\n\nastigmatism.\n\n  Its surface reveals small,\n\nlow-contrast details only when viewed with excellent optics. On April\n\nevenings when the 13-arcsecond-diameter disk had the Elysium-Tharsis\n\nhemisphere turned toward Earth, the Ultima clearly showed tiny white spots,\n\nwhich were likely orographic clouds.\n The residual north polar cap appeared well-defined and surrounded by\n\nthe dark belt of polar dune fields.\n\n  For comparison I also viewed Mars at the same magnification (\n\nroughly 225x) with a 5-inch apochromatic refractor.\n I expected images through the 8-inch Ultima to be brighter, but, to\n\nmy surprise, they also exhibited a shade more contrast and detail.\n Yes, the refractor was giving near-perfect image quality, but sheer\n\naperture was winning out, despite the Ultima 's 34 percent ( by diameter)\n\ncentral obstruction, which degrades image contrast.\n\n  My ultimate testament to this telescope 's optics is the fact that\n\nI actually used it apart from conducting tests!\n I\n\nfeel these optics fulfill Celestron 's promise of diffraction-limited\n\nperformance.\n\n  The telescope arrived slightly out of collimation, possibly due\n\nto rough handling during shipment.\n Small tweaks to the secondary mirror 's three collimation screws made\n\nall the difference between an acceptable image and one full of sharp\n\ndetail.\n\n  As expected, on freezing nights the telescope optics took about\n\n45 minutes to settle down when brought outdoors.\n The corrector plate is coated with a single layer of magnesium\n\nfluoride on each surface, and the primary and secondary mirrors have\n\nwell-designed baffles to eliminate stray light from the focal plane.\n I found no glare or internal reflections, even when observing near\n\nthe Moon.\n\n  The 7x50 finderscope is of excellent quality.\n Its polar-alignment reticles were accurate and extremely useful when\n\nI was setting up the telescope for astrophotography.\n My only complaint with the finder is its mounting bracket: it uses\n\nthree screws at the front but only a rubber O-ring at the back.\n The O-ring allowed too much movement. I found it necessary to tweak\n\nthe finder 's alignment almost every night, especially if the telescope had\n\nbeen pressed into its foam-lined trunk for storage.\n A quick-release, six-screw bracket would be a better choice on a\n\ntelescope of this caliber.\n\n  The internal focusing of the main mirror proved very smooth and\n\nprecise.\n It exhibited none of the mushiness or backlash I've experienced with\n\n'vee older Schmidt- Cassegrains.\n The image shift was a slight 20 arcseconds, not enough to pose\n\nproblems even when imaging with small CCD chips.\n\n\n  The Ultima 2000 was quick to set up, lightweight, yet solid.\n The telescope with its sturdy fork mount weighs only 31 pounds.\n The Ultima 's 18-pound tripod proved extremely rigid and sturdy.\n Its height can be varied by as much as 25 inches.\n With the legs fully retracted the eyepiece is about 42 inches above\n\nground level, ideal for comfortable seated viewing.\n\n  With the telescope set up for altazimuth operation and the tripod\n\nplaced on a grassy surface, vibrations damped out remarkably quickly.\n There was only about one second of ringing after a sharp rap to the\n\ntube.\n Removing the rubber crutch tips from the tripod legs reduced this to\n\n1/2 second.\n Placing a set of Celestron 's Vibration Suppression Pads under the\n\nbare legs reduced the damping time to essentially zero--the telescope was\n\ndead solid, a good reason to use the telescope in altazimuth mode.\n Placing the telescope on its 12-pound equatorial wedge added about\n\n1/2 second of ringing to all setup combinations.\n These are figures as good as I've seen with any fork 'veunted\n\nSchmidt-Cassegrain.\n\n  The Ultima has no analog setting circles or mechanical\n\nslow-motion controls since both functions are handled with the telescope 's\n\nelectronics.\n Both axes have clutch adjustments that tighten but never fully\n\nlock. Although it 's still possible to manually move the telescope when the\n\nclutches are fully engaged, I found the axes locked sufficiently tight to\n\nprevent slipping when cameras or heavy eyepieces were attached.\n\n  Each axis has two DC motors.\n One is for fast slewing ( up to 1O\u00b0 per second when operated with\n\nfresh batteries) and the slower \" find\" speed ( 2\u00b0 per second).\n The other motor is for tracking as well as the \" center,\" \" guide,\"\n\nand \" fine guide\" speeds, which are 6, 2, and 1/2 times the tracking rate,\n\nrespectively.\n Selecting these rates as the telescope 's default speed is a somewhat\n\ninvolved process using the computerized menus, which are all accessed and\n\ndisplayed with the hand controller.\n There are, however, handy shortcuts.\n Pressing any of the telescope 's four direction buttons and either the \"\n\nup\" or \" down\" button on the controller allows quick access to the other\n\nspeeds.\n You can also press and hold a direction button and then press its\n\nopposite button to momentarily slew the scope at a higher speed.\n\n  In addition to the electronic slewing, the Ultima can be aimed\n\nmanually without disrupting the computerized operation.\n The telescope 's encoders keep track of where the instrument is\n\npointed even when it is manually swung around the sky.\n This is a nice feature, which saves battery power and keeps many of\n\nthe telescope 's smart features functional even if the battery power drops too\n\nlow to operate the power-hungry slew speeds.\n\n  How long the internal AA batteries last depends on how much\n\nhigh-speed slewing you do. If their output drops below 81/2 volts, the \"\n\nslew\" and \" find\" speeds give out but the slow-speed motors and\n\nhand-controller display continue to operate.\n ( One of the hand controller 's displays is a useful voltmeter.)\n I found that high-speed slewing to a few dozen objects on a warm\n\nnight drained the batteries below this threshold level after four or five\n\nnights.\n\n  To save battery power the light-emitting-diode ( LED) display on\n\nthe hand controller can be dimmed or even turned off while the telescope\n\ncontinues to track.\n There 's also a \" sleep\" mode that shuts off the tracking motors but\n\nallows the electronics to continue calculating where the instrument is\n\npointed as the sky drifts by.\n Thus the Ultima could be left idling in a permanent observatory where\n\nthe user doesn't want to initialize the scope every night or wants to use it\n\nfor daytime sightings when reference stars aren't easily located.\n\n  The Ultima can also be run from any external 12-volt source ( no\n\nAC adapter is supplied).\n The batteries proved wonderfully convenient for portable observing.\n They lasted for many weeks' worth of occasional viewing\n\nnights--better than the 24-hour lifetime specified in the manual, but only if\n\nhigh-speed slewing was kept to a minimum.\n\n\n  The compact hand controller serves as a gateway to all of the\n\ntelescope 's computerized functions.\n Its LED readout worked well even in subfreezing temperatures.\n The \" menu\" button takes you to the top level of each menu, while the \"\n\nup\" and \" down\" buttons page through the options.\n\n\n  is for performing the initial two-star\n\ninitialization, which is necessary for all the automatic slewing and\n\naltazimuth-tracking features to work.\n No polar alignment is required, nor any inputting of date or\n\nobserving location.\n\n  steps through a database of a dozen or more\n\nobjects selected for each month.\n It 's a nice feature for beginners, though I thought the ordering of\n\nthe lists was a little random around the sky.\n Sometimes selected objects were below the horizon, which might be\n\nconfusing to those same beginners.\n The Ultima does not keep track of where the horizon is relative to\n\nthe sky.\n The manual explains that the software was purposely designed to allow\n\naiming at any object you want, whether or not it 's visible!\n\n  is for adjusting various parameters such as\n\nslew speed, altazimuth or equatorial tracking modes ( in either the Northern\n\nor Southern Hemisphere), the speed that information scrolls across the LED\n\ndisplay, backlash compensation, and drive rate ( from a choice of sidereal,\n\nKing, lunar, and solar).\n\n\n  initiates a single-event count-up\n\nstop-watch. There is no alarm feature.\n\n  displays the identity of any object\n\ncurrently in the telescope 's field, provided the object is in the computer 's\n\ndatabase.\n It also allows locating nearby targets from the entire database or\n\nfrom a user-definable list such as just globular clusters brighter than\n\nmagnitude 10.\n\n  displays the telescope 's current right\n\nascension and declination or azimuth and altitude.\n The latter was important when I was setting up the telescope in\n\nequatorial mode since slewing the test telescope to +89.9\u00b0 put the optical\n\ntube essentially parallel to the fork arms, an important step for polar\n\nalignment.\n\n  is a powerful menu option. It allows\n\nselecting any object from the Messier, NGC, and Index Catalogs, as well as\n\nselected entries from the ESO and Uppsala galaxy catalogs--a total of\n\nthousands of objects.\n An intriguing bonus list unique to the Ultima is 661 nonstellar\n\nobjects, such as obscure open clusters, starlike planetaries, Palomar\n\nglobulars, dwarf galaxies, and Abell galaxy clusters.\n The otherwise very thorough and complete instruction manual\n\nincorrectly states that a full printout of this list is contained in the\n\nmanual.\n This is too bad since it 's difficult to remember, for example, that\n\nthe wonderful planetary nebula Abell is object 103 in this list.\n\n\n  Users can also store the positions of up to 27 personal objects,\n\neither by entering the coordinates or by aiming the telescope at the desired\n\nobject and automatically storing the current position.\n This is a powerful feature.\n It could even be used to slew back and forth between two fixed\n\nterrestrial objects--bird nests, for example.\n The Ultima 's computer knows the position of the Sun and planets, but\n\nstewing to them automatically requires inputting the current date each night,\n\na simple procedure.\n\n  You can display details for all objects in the database.\n These include an object 's right ascension and declination, magnitude,\n\nsize, constellation, a short but useful description, and the number of the\n\nchart showing the object in  Uranometria 2000  or  Star Atlas\n\n2000.0  star atlases, a helpful bonus.\n Pressing the \" enter\" button while this information is scrolling\n\nacross the LED display sends the Ultima slewing at high speed to the\n\ntarget.\n\n  For objects far across the sky, I found motorized slewing never\n\ntook more than 35 seconds to complete, counting the high-speed move, then the\n\nfinal slow-speed fine pointing.\n Nearby objects never took less than 15 seconds to find.\n These figures are nothing to complain about but perhaps are not as\n\nfast as the advertised slew rate of 10\u00b0 per second would lead you to believe.\n With the Ultima 's \" cord wrap\" feature turned off, the telescope\n\nalways takes the shortest route to the next object.\n I was never able to get the telescope tangled up, colliding with\n\nitself, or confused, even when tracking or slewing it through the zenith, or\n\npurposely aiming it at invisible objects below the horizon.\n\n  A noteworthy feature is the Ultima 's quiet slewing.\n The high-speed motors emit a gentle whir.\n The noisiest function is actually the slower 6x \" center\" speed, but\n\neven it is hard to heat from more than a few feet away.\n It 's unlikely this telescope will wake up the neighbor 's dog or star\n\nparty members sleeping in a nearby tent.\n\n\n  The Ultima I tested had a periodic tracking error of about 35 to\n\n40 arcseconds.\n The software includes periodic- error correction ( PEC), which\n\nallows you to \" train\" the drive and reduce the error when doing\n\nlong-exposure imaging.\n The training is not retained when the power is turned off; it must\n\nbe performed each night, a decided inconvenience. This was a moot point,\n\nhowever, since the PEC on the test unit did nor work correctly.\n When switched on it caused the drive to run intermittently slow and\n\nmade it impossible to train the unit.\n With the PEC off, the drive 's sidereal rate was accurate and happily\n\nkept objects near the center of a high-power eyepiece all night.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b9b37e80-cca6-47a8-a23d-2224fa811651", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.758762+00:00"}

Power was sentenced yesterday to 8 to 12\n\nyears in prison for her part in the 1970 Allston bank robbery in which Boston\n\nPolice Officer Walter A. Schroeder was killed.\n\n  Superior Court Judge Robert Banks, in an extraordinary move, also\n\nwarned Power that, once she is paroled after serving her term, she might be\n\nsent back to prison for life should she try to profit from her role in the\n\ncelebrated case.\n\n  During an emotional hearing in Suffolk Superior Court, the former\n\nstudent revolutionary who drove the getaway car apologized forcefully,\n\ntearfully - and briefly - for her role in the murder, saying she could not\n\nfind the words to express her sorrow for Schroeder 's death.\n\n  Schroeder 's eldest daughter, Clare, meanwhile, found eight pages\n\nof words, detailing her family 's two decades of loss and bitterly denouncing\n\nPower as a member of an \" armed criminal gang,\" whom time had transformed\n\ninto a celebrity.\n\n  \" While Katherine Power was fleeing across the country - spending\n\nthe money she stole from the State Street Bank, smuggling sawed-off shotguns\n\nthrough the St. Louis airport, and plotting to weld railroad cars to the\n\ntracks to disrupt military shipments - my mother was burying my father in\n\nEvergreen Cemetery,\" said Schroeder, a sergeant in the Waltham Police\n\nDepartment and the oldest of Schroeder 's nine children.\n\n  \" While Katherine Power was establishing her new life in Oregon -\n\nlearning to cook, establishing a restaurant, and hunting game birds with her\n\nhusband - my mother was struggling every day to care for us, to provide for\n\nus, and to give us a loving home . .. on a Boston police pension.\n\n \n\n  \" I reject the proposition that your criminal activities were\n\njustified, excused or even mitigated,\" Banks said.\n\n\n  Clare Schroeder 's latest worry - that Power could make a \" small\n\nfortune,\" by selling her story - was allayed yesterday by Banks.\n\n  In a unique addendum to Power 's sentence, Banks placed her on\n\nprobation for 20 years on one of two armed robbery charges with the proviso\n\nthat her probation would be revoked and she would be jailed for life if she\n\nengaged in any activity that would permit her to profit from her crime.\n\n  \" I will not permit profit off the lifeblood of police officers ...\n That is repugnant to me and I could not live with myself,\" said\n\nBanks, who adopted the 8- to 12-year sentence recommended by Suffolk\n\nAssistant District Attorney Walter Shea.\n Power will be eligible for parole after serving five years and four\n\nmonths of the sentence.\n\n  Power, a former Brandeis University honors student, still faces\n\none federal charge of theft of government property for her role in a raid on\n\na National Guard armory in Newburyport three days before the bank robbery.\n Federal prosecutors are expected to recommend a five-year sentence to\n\nrun concurrently with the state sentence she received yesterday when Power is\n\nsentenced on Nov. 24.\n\n  Her decision to surrender brought to an end 23 years on the run\n\nfor Power, who waited in a getaway car while fellow Brandeis student Susan\n\nE.Saxe, former prison inmates Stanley Bond, then 25, and Robert J.Valeri,\n\nthen 21, robbed the Allston branch of the State Street Bank of\n\n&dollar; 26,000 on Sept. 23, 1970, reportedly to finance revolutionary antiwar\n\nactivities.\n William ( Lefty) Gilday shot Schroeder in the back as he approached\n\nthe bank.\n\n\n  Valeri confessed within hours.\n Gilday was captured within days after a shootout with police and is\n\nserving a life sentence.\n\n  Bond was arrested in a Colorado motel several days later.\n He died in 1972 when a bomb he was constructing in his prison cell in\n\nWalpole exploded.\n\n  But Saxe and Power went underground, sheltered in a feminist\n\nunderground network.\n They lived and worked in Connecticut and Pennsylvania until Saxe was\n\narrested on a Philadelphia street in 1975.\n\n  After stopping in New Jersey to fashion a new identity - Power\n\nsettled on Alice L.Metzinger, the name of an infant who died shortly after\n\nbirth in 1949 - she headed to Oregon.\n There she started two restaurants, had a son, now 14, and married\n\nRonley Duncan last year.\n Duncan, a slight man with a braided, gray-flecked ponytail, was in\n\ncourt yesterday with their son, Jaime, whom he adopted last year.\n\n  \" Katherine participated in a criminal act 23 years ago,\" Duncan\n\nwrote in a letter to Banks.\n\n\n  Power 's attorney, Rikki Klieman, had asked for a more lenient\n\nsentence of 6 to 12 years, saying Power took full responsibility for her\n\nactions and was penitent.\n During her time in Oregon, Power had become \" a woman of substance\"\n\nwho cares for others and was charitable, Klieman said.\n\n  \" But it must be unequivocally stated that Katherine Power is not\n\na hero and Katherine Power is an accomplice to a crime,\" Klieman said.\n\n  \" No question about that,\" retorted Banks, who rejected\n\nsuggestions that Power suffered from clinical depression during her years as\n\na fugitive or that her actions were somehow excused by the tenor of the\n\ntimes.\n\n  Klieman had submitted more than 100 letters supporting a lenient\n\nsentence, including one from Robert O.Muller, the executive director of the\n\nVietnam Veterans of America Foundation, who asked for leniency \" in the\n\nspirit of reconciliation and healing.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d952ac1c-1fe2-4fa6-962b-8e4cb7e024bc", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.760351+00:00"}

and\n\nthe local, and of questioning frameworks that are in themselves only\n\nrelatively new, such as the public/private divide, the polite/popular culture\n\ndivide, gender practices, consumer culture, and everyday life.\n Although there has been some effort on the part of historians to step\n\nback and define cultural history as a distinct practice, what remains to be\n\ndone is a thoroughgoing examination of cultural history as a theoretically\n\nframed and integrative approach to the past.\n Here I will sketch out some points about cultural history that may aid\n\nin such an interrogation.\n\n<P>  Cultural historical research necessitates a multiply layered\n\nperspective and approach.\n This is not the same as interdisciplinarity, because interdisciplinary\n\napproaches presuppose the priority of the disciplines, with their grounding\n\nobjects of study: the discipline of literature takes a particular kind of\n\ntext as its object; history takes the nation state; sociology takes class;\n\nanthropology takes culture; ethnology takes comparative cultures, economics\n\ntakes the industrial city.\n These objects are constructs: class, for instance, is an abstract\n\nconcept that defines sociological research in the direction of class\n\nconflict.\n This assumed definition narrows, methodologically but also\n\nconceptually, how society might be studied.\n Similarly, although literary scholars and historians both study\n\ntexts, historians examine texts for evidence while literary scholars examine\n\nparticular kinds of texts for formal and cultural expression.\n Interdisciplinary studies also presume these disciplinary frameworks,\n\nso that something like urban studies, while drawing on economics, sociology,\n\nand so forth, takes as its object of study class in the metropolis.\n\n<P>  As Romanticists attempt to go ever deeper into textual\n\nunderstanding while staying attuned to the cultural milieu that produced\n\nRomantic Period texts and that formed the imaginations of their authors, they\n\nare forging new relations with other disciplines, as is happening in so many\n\nof the liberal arts.\n For literary scholars the other disciplines proving useful are\n\nincreasingly those of the social sciences \u0013 economics, psychology,\n\ndemographic studies, anthropology, urban studies \u0013 and hard sciences such as\n\nmeteorology, geology, cartography, environmental studies, astronomy, and the\n\nmedical sciences.\n While some academics worry about the way in which the sciences appear\n\nto be valued over the humanities in interdisciplinary research, and others\n\nare concerned about retaining disciplinary purity as scholars attempt to\n\nmaster the approach and the skills of other disciplines, these concerns may\n\nbe balanced by what we necessarily stand to gain in the pooling of\n\ninformation.\n Here is where cultural history steps in, because its starting point\n\ndiffers from that of the disciplinary object of study.\n Cultural history asks a question or poses a problem.\n In seeking to answer that question or understand that problem, the\n\nscholar is freed to bring together whatever tools are necessary to create\n\nframeworks from which to study it.\n Thus the accepted disciplinary practice of disregarding what does not\n\nfit the approach to a defined object of study can no longer apply: the\n\nscholar must be open to all potential facts, paradoxes, and discrepancies.\n allows for a\n\nflexible practice \u0013 one that resists the regularization of approach and\n\nmethodology since each new problem or question requires new frameworks to be\n\ncreated. \n\n<P>  Thus, when a cultural historian asks what daily life was like in\n\nRomantic period London, and draws on literature, urban studies and the\n\nhistory of economics to do so, a new framework must be devised to reconstruct\n\nwhat it was like, for instance, for Jane Austen to purchase her tea, sugar,\n\ncocoa, dress materials, and gloves, or to attend fashionable art exhibitions\n\nwhile visiting her banker brother in Sloane Street.\n The consumer history, material culture, and trade economics involved\n\nin this information sheds light not just on the lives of real people, but on\n\nthe careful detailing of foodstuffs, dress fabrics and accessories in women\u0019s\n\nnovels, all of which signal something important to characterization or plot\n\nin the specific act or article of dress being described.\n Involving the theory of everyday life in this mix would help\n\nreconstruct what everyday practices were, although such reconstructions are\n\nadmittedly incomplete and open to ongoing revision.\n The same pooling of disciplinary resources ( rather than restricting\n\noneself to methodological purity) would allow a scholar to reconstruct the\n\ncultural importance of what Richard Altick has termed  \u001cthe shows of\n\nLondon\u001d ( 1), a sudden emergence of exhibitions of curiosities,\n\nnatural objects, and art that moved indoors from the public square space of\n\nBartholomew Fair and Southwark Fair, or that became more public and\n\nentrepreneurial than the antiquarian collections of wealthy virtuosi (\n\ngentlemen scholars) and picture collections of the great landed families.\n The new indoor shows ranged from innovative technologies such as\n\nmechanical manikins to menageries of exotic animals, exhibitions of foreign\n\nplants or artifacts, displays of live tribal peoples with their native\n\ncostumes and implements, and shows of exotic or ancient art.\n While we might make the connection easily between these London shows\n\nand the rise of national museums in the nineteenth century, such a\n\nreconstruction requires revealing the trade networks, collecting fads,\n\nscientific research, and global explorations that made such shows possible,\n\nand that gave enormous stimuli to the great literary imaginations of the\n\nperiod, from the visionary William Blake to the cosmopolitan Lord Byron. \n\n<P>  This way of framing the pursuit of knowledge differs in kind and\n\ndegree from that of interdisciplinarity, which is all too frequently touted\n\nas the answer to disciplinary restrictiveness.\n Indeed, scholars have been warning about interdisciplinarity as a\n\ntoo-easy accommodation of disciplines for years.\n In 1988 Janet Wolff complained that when literary studies and\n\nsociology were brought together, particularly in the U.S., the result was\n\neither a literary critical investigation privileging an ideological-critical\n\nperspective which rarely attempted  \u001cto discuss representation as the\n\ncomplex product of processes and institutions,\u001d or it was a\n\nsociological investigation that analyzed institutions  \u001cwithout a real\n\nsensitivity to representation and textuality\u001d ( 109).3 Insensitivity\n\nto either institutional agency on the one hand, or aesthetic form on the\n\nother, means an either/or approach and a constitutive blindness to cultural\n\nprocesses: social and economic relations and social and ideological relations\n\nconstitute culture as it is experienced.\n Wolff puts some of the blame for this lack of real\n\ninterdisciplinarity on the weight given scientific objectivity versus\n\nsubjectively informed humanistic interpretative strategies.\n The nineteenth-century professionalization of more generalized areas\n\nof scholarship into separate disciplines contributed to the segregations of\n\nknowledge and activity that have helped create an  \u001cincreasingly\n\nfragmented and compartmentalized way of life\u001d ( 72).\n The professionalizing of the university guided not only the creation\n\nand definition of disciplines, it also guided collaborative effort.\n work was often taken to be\n\nresearch that occurred entirely within the domain of one discipline or that\n\ncentered on a shared object of study, rather than one that profited from\n\ndifferent epistemological frameworks.4 Attempts to talk across disciplinary\n\nboundaries became increasingly fraught in the second half of the twentieth\n\ncentury as the increased value given culturally and politically to scientific\n\nspecialization was accompanied by a decreasing valuation of humanistic\n\ngeneralism.\n Either/or thinking reflects the binarisms at stake in disciplinary as\n\nwell as interdisciplinary studies.\n\n<P>  We are still struggling with this see-saw effect in which the\n\nliberal arts and the sciences are made to counterbalance each other, as we\n\nalso struggle to escape the constraints and blindspots of disciplinary\n\nassumptions.\n Each year more efforts are made to reconnect scientific and artistic\n\nknowledge through projects that, for instance, might investigate both the\n\nmechanics of the eye and the interpretive judgments determined by that eye\n\ntoward an artwork, or that might apply the principles of baroque music to\n\nmedical research on the ear.\n But this recent trend is often untheorized and haphazard.\n It has been preceded by more traditional forms of discipline-crossing\n\nin which two disciplines from the humanities or two from the physical\n\nsciences are brought together in ways that do not interrogate the assumptions\n\nof either discipline, and therefore do not de-compartmentalize how an object\n\nof study is conceived or approached.\n Because so much has been made of interdisciplinary work and areas of\n\nstudy in the last two decades or so, scholars may well have wanted to rush to\n\nknowledge rather than taking the time to learn how economists construe trade\n\nrelations or model urban demographics, how historians gather and analyze\n\ndata, or how art historians analyze paintings, architectural elevations and\n\nother visual images and artifacts.\n As Janet Wolff notes, we tend to foreground our own discipline, and\n\nfor literary scholars this means giving analysis of the literary text\n\npriority.\n Often a multidisciplinary approach ( putting two disciplines\n\nside-by-side) provides an easy fix because it does not demand the same degree\n\nof theoretical and methodological integration as an interdisciplinary one (\n\ninterconnecting disciplines at a deep level so that each is viewed through\n\nthe other), and yet appears to escape the difficulties arising in\n\ninterdisciplinary work.\n A thorough integration of conceptual frameworks and tools can move us\n\neven further past disiciplinary assumptions and facile approaches, producing\n\nknowledge through a juxtaposition of disciplines that encourages\n\ncross-interrogation into the cultural past.\n between\n\nthe disciplines so much as talking across them to see how similarities and\n\ndifferences in conceptual models and disciplinary methods can be made to help\n\nus view problems in cultural history in a more three-dimensional way.\n Cultural history can provide a method of problem-solving by opening\n\nup frameworks rather than presuming them. \n\n<P>  But we do need to attend seriously to a careful use of\n\ndisciplinary knowledge as we move beyond the boxes that disciplines\n\nconstruct.\n First, language itself can often trip us up.\n Different disciplines have different technical meanings for words, as\n\nin  \u001cprosody,\u001d which in literary analysis refers to the poetic\n\neffects ( acoustics and rhythm, or versification) of crafted language, is\n\nused in linguistics to refer to parts of a language\u0019s sound structure ( tone\n\nand intonation), and in musicology to refer to musical phrasing and acoustic\n\ncues.\n Yet the very use of the same term by different disciplines also\n\nfacilitates interdisciplinary research, as when clinical psychologists use\n\nlinguistics to help explore cognitive dysfunction through a patient\u0019s\n\nrecognition of affective prosody ( emotional tone of voice) and propositional\n\nprosody ( whether the sentence is a question, imperative or declarative).\n\n\n\n<P>  Second, interdisciplinary study is usually too grounded in the\n\ndisciplines that gave rise to it, such as urban studies, which developed from\n\na particular integration of sociology, economics, and history, while American\n\nstudies integrates disciplines necessary to the analysis of class, race, and\n\ngender.\n These interdisciplinary studies developed new conceptual models based\n\non the theories that orient their object of study.\n They thus create new ways of understanding that offer insights to\n\nother fields, but they can also provoke deeply instilled resistance to the\n\nintermixing of discipline-specific methodologies.\n Those working in cultural history need to beware the distinction\n\nbetween interdisciplinary work and an approach that moves beyond disciplinary\n\nmethodologies.\n As Dror Wahrman notes of an improperly conceived cultural history,\n\nits  most problematic methodological quagmire . . . can be described as\n\nthe difficulty of the  \u001cweak collage\u001d: the historian,\n\nidentifying a seemingly similar phenomenon in several disparate cultural\n\nspheres at the same historical moment, declares it to be a pattern of\n\nhistorical significance. ( 45)\n Although this difficulty can be circumvented through quantitative\n\nevidence, the historian\u0019s stock-in-trade, the problems of change over time\n\nand categorical difference can mean that pattern changes in cultural forms\n\nand modes might be dispersed throughout a period or beyond period boundaries\n\nrather than accumulating synchronously.\n It is the cross-interrogation of their appearance, in other words,\n\nthat resolves anomalies into discernible patterns, and that produces real\n\nknowledge rather than a  \u001cweak collage.\u001d \n\n<P>  Cultural history involves an approach in which cultural and\n\nmaterial practices are investigated in order to reveal shifts in human\n\nsubjectivity and identity, social class hierarchies and constructions,\n\npolitical identity, institutional formations, and changes in religious,\n\neconomic, and creative practices, their reception and tolerance or\n\nresistance.\n itself is a hotly debated one,\n\nits meaning ranging from social history to anthropological analysis, cultural\n\nsociology, ethnography, cultural studies, community identity, cultural\n\nidentity, and a tradition of cultural achievements in the arts.\n For literary studies, Raymond Williams\u0019s seminal works on the\n\ncultural grounds of literary production provide the arena for understanding\n\n\u0018culture\u0019 as the integration of traditional, dominant, and emergent forms\n\nthat at any one moment formulate a literary culture, and the economic and\n\nsocial conditions that facilitate such a culture.5 But those trained in other\n\ndisciplines would argue for a different understanding; anthropologists, for\n\nexample, have moved from considering  \u001cculture\u001d as a\n\nnon-dynamic concept to understanding it as that which is dynamically produced\n\nat any given moment by a body of people, so that an individual can move from\n\nthe culture of his or her workplace to the culture of the street, to that of\n\nthe subway, to that of the home.\n As William Sewell argues, part of the confusion in how to define\n\nculture lies in the hazy distinctions often made between conceptual and\n\nconcrete understandings of  \u001cculture.\u001d Theoretical concepts of\n\nculture refer to broad categories of social life, while concrete studies of\n\ncultures refer to culture as practice, culture  \u001cnot [ as] a coherent\n\nsystem of symbols and meanings but a diverse collection of \u0018tools\u0019 that . . .\n\nare to be understood as means for the performance of action\u001d  (\n\nSewell 40).\n This understanding of concrete cultures, viewed through theories\n\narising from a range of disciplines, can produce a cultural history that\n\nreconstructs a stronger and more vital picture of the past or present.\n By contrast, not differentiating clearly between conceptual and\n\nconcrete meanings of culture can lead to a falsifying attempt to integrate\n\nthese two definitions, allowing the  \u001csmuggl[ing of] highly debatable\n\nassumptions into ethnographic accounts \u0013 for example, that cultural meanings\n\nare normally shared, fixed, bounded, and deeply felt\u001d  ( 41). </P>", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "74c2891e-e210-46a8-a7cb-7a6d88f384f7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.761655+00:00"}

Colin Powell sticks to his military\n\ndictum that battles shouldn't be joined without overwhelmingly superior force\n\nand a virtual assurance of victory, then he will not enter the presidential\n\nrace this fall.\n But if he is guided by another one of his maxims - that campaigns\n\nrequire the clear support of the American people - then he should run.\n\n  There is no denying the excitement that a possible Powell\n\ncandidacy has generated.\n In television and radio interviews the general exudes a quiet\n\nconfidence and common-sense approach to politics that appeal to the broad\n\ncenter increasingly turned off by both political parties.\n\n  Gradually, as his positions emerge, Powell is coming across as\n\nmore fiscally conservative than the Democrats and more socially liberal than\n\nmost of the Republicans.\n This might argue for a run as an independent.\n But as Powell himself has said, independent candidates don't win\n\npresidential elections.\n He said he was reluctant to play the spoiler and \" throw the election\n\nup in the air.?\n Therefore we would urge Powell to enter the race as a Republican.\n True, he may be a tad liberal for some hard-core GOP primary voters.\n But the field lacks luster, and of the 52 primaries and caucuses next\n\nyear, the 34 that allow independents and Democrats to cross over account for\n\n1,213 out of the 1,984 GOP delegates to be chosen.\n Disappointed Perot supporters who are looking for a fresh but less\n\neccentric personality might well turn to the general.\n Were a Powell candidacy to push the GOP toward moderation, so much\n\nthe better.\n Political parties are not that difficult to capture, as Barry\n\nGoldwater, Ronald Reagan, George McGovern and even Bill Clinton have\n\nproved.\n\n  Race is never far below the surface in American life, and it is\n\ndifficult to predict its effect were Powell to run.\n But race is not what is driving a Powell candidacy.\n\n\n  Many questions about Powell remain to be answered.\n But let him immerse himself in the acid bath of presidential politics\n\nand the quality of his mettle will emerge.\n National service was one of Bill\n\nClinton 's most appealing themes as a candidate, and it was one of the prime\n\nlegislative successes of his first year in the White House.\n\n  Now Republicans are trying to snuff the life out of AmeriCorps,\n\nthe national service program that has been operating, and thriving, for just\n\nover a year.\n Senators face a choice this week of whether to kill it, as their\n\nAppropriations Committee and the House have already voted, or continue it at\n\nits current level.\n Eliminating national service would definitely be bad policy; it would\n\nquite likely also be a political boomerang.\n\n  AmeriCorps is popular in all sections of the country, generating\n\nsupport from 90 percent of those familiar with it, according to a Gallup\n\nsurvey, and for good reason.\n It now has more than 20,000 members contributing to their communities\n\ntangibly: cleaning up streets, parks and streams; assisting teachers in\n\nschools; helping build housing; encouraging neighborhood crime-fighting\n\nefforts.\n For this, members get a modest stipend and\n\n&dollar; 4,725 to spend on college or vocational education.\n An offshoot - Learn and Serve AmeriCorps - helps stimulate part-time\n\ncommunity service from some 750,000 young people who are still in school.\n\n  The overall federal cost of\n\n&dollar; 400 million - less than\n\n&dollar; 20,000 a person - leverages more than\n\n&dollar; 200 million in state and private funding.\n\n\n  There are only two rational reasons for members of Congress to\n\noppose AmeriCorps.\n One is the genuine belief of minimalists that government should do\n\nnothing more than is absolutely necessary.\n But even conservative governors like William Weld, John Engler of\n\nMichigan and Stephen Merrill of New Hampshire are enthusiastic about national\n\nservice generally and specifically about AmeriCorps, which focuses on local\n\nprojects.\n\n  The other reason is to deny Clinton what has become his signature\n\nprogram.\n If Congress is willing to dump AmeriCorps out of pure politics, the\n\ncynicism implicit in this rationale, along with the actual damage, will not\n\nescape the voters.\n BODY: The disquieting frequency of\n\nfailures recently in America 's air traffic control network highlights the\n\nneed for fundamental changes in the Federal Aviation Administration.\n The FAA as presently constituted has proven unable to effect the\n\nmajor upgrades in technology needed to protect the safety of pilots, crew and\n\npassengers in US airspace.\n\n  It would not be going too far to say that the air traffic control\n\ninfrastructure is crumbling.\n Radar screens are going blank and radios are going dead across the\n\ncountry.\n At the Aurora, Ill., nerve center that guides airplanes over six\n\nMidwestern states, the main system has gone down five times since May.\n Last week a power failure took out the radar at Pittsburgh\n\nInternational Airport, while a similar outage in Northern California last\n\nmonth disabled not only the primary computer but also its backup.\n\n  The foremost reason is age.\n Some of the devices that guide 1.5 million people across our skies\n\neach day still use vacuum tubes instead of transistors.\n The main computer at Aurora is 25 years old.\n Modernization has been hampered by byzantine procurement regulations\n\non the one hand and an average two-year tenure for politically appointed FAA\n\nchiefs on the other.\n\n\n  Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Rep. John Duncan of Tennessee\n\nhave introduced competing bills to achieve it.\n The Duncan bill would remove the FAA from the Department of\n\nTransportation and make it an independent agency headed by an executive\n\nappointed by a five-member board.\n Making the administrator independent yet accountable is an excellent\n\nidea; the McCain bill would leave the FAA under the Department of\n\nTransportation 's umbrella.\n Duncan 's plan to remove the aviation trust fund from the budget would\n\nfree up some cash for operating expenses at first, but if that language\n\nprevails in conference committee, safeguards should be added to make sure the\n\nbulk of the fund remains intact so the agency has enough money for new\n\nequipment in the future.\n There is no doubt that computer networks\n\nare creating new modes of communication, but it is becoming equally obvious\n\nthat they are also clearing the way for a new permutation on an old American\n\ntradition: the wasteful and ill-conceived legal action.\n The perpetrators are small-time companies engaged in quixotic\n\nlawsuits for electronic libel.\n\n  Last week the Carib Inn in the Antilles filed suit against\n\nAmerica Online to release the true identity of one its users - known by the\n\nhandle Jenny TRR - so the resort can sue \" Jenny\" for libel.\n Her offense?\n Posting a message in AOL 's SCUBA area relating an alleged experience\n\nwith a stoned diving instructor at the inn.\n\n  The inn 's owners seem to be taking a cue from the misguided\n\ndirectors of the Stratton-Oakmont investment bank, which is suing Prodigy for\n\nallowing an unknown user to post an allegedly defamatory comment on one of\n\nits boards.\n The bank wants\n\n&dollar; 200 million in damages.\n Ironically, the door to holding Prodigy liable as a publisher was\n\nopened by the company 's attempts to screen obscene and otherwise\n\nobjectionable messages.\n\n  Can anyone imagine besmirched customers trying to hold tavern\n\nowners liable for anonymous bathroom wall graffitti, or insisting they hunt\n\ndown the authors?\n Of course not.\n Judges need to refine the law to protect on-line providers from\n\nliability for the sharp typing fingers of their users.\n Some of the Republican presidential\n\nhopefuls got a publicity boost when they unveiled their sites on the\n\nInternet 's World Wide Web, and for good reason.\n A presence on the web could generate new interactions between\n\ncandidates and the public.\n\n  But that promise has gone largely unfulfilled.\n A survey of campaign sites reveals a lot of stale press releases and\n\n150-word issue summaries but no sense of real communication - certainly none\n\nof the healthy two-way dialogue found on sites like the one run by New\n\nHampshire 's second-largest newspaper, Foster 's Daily Democrat - or even any\n\nhumor like that embodied by the tongue-in-cheek Hispanics for Wilson page.\n Instead, the GOP candidates' Internet presence seems to have little\n\npurpose other than impressing the media.\n We are not impressed.\n Bob Dole, who does not have an official site, now has an opportunity\n\nto show up his rivals and do something to trim his dowdy image.\n A Congress that is flirting with an Oct.\n\n1 government shutdown because of its budget disputes with President Clinton\n\nfaces a less prominent but equally important deadline Dec. 31, by which time\n\nit must act to preserve the funding mechanism for cleaning up hazardous waste\n\nsites.\n If Congress fails to renew special levies on the petroleum and\n\nchemical industries, which yield\n\n&dollar; 1.5 billion annually, money for the cleanup of hazardous wastes will dry\n\nup.\n\n  The Superfund system, established in 1980 to help manage and pay\n\nfor hazardous-waste cleanup, has never satisfied everyone.\n The slow pace of the cleanups, the mounting number of identified\n\nsites, the arbitrariness of some cleanup rules and the potential for large\n\nfines despite minimal involvement have produced demands for revisions.\n The risks of acquiring possibly contaminated sites, moreover, has led\n\nto a preference for virgin land for industrial development - a considerable\n\ndisadvantage for old regions, especially cities.\n\n  Despite these misgivings, Congress has extended the 1980 act\n\nseveral times.\n It now appears willing to let the special taxes and fees expire at\n\nthe end of the year.\n That would be a mistake, because future federal funding of toxic\n\nwaste cleanup would then have to come from general revenues and compete with\n\nfunding for other programs.\n\n  Indeed, the petroleum and chemical industries want extension of\n\nthe special taxes, and they advocate earmarking Superfund money so it won't\n\nbe siphoned off into the general fund for deficit reduction.\n This has led to underspending by the fund and the accumulation of a\n\nsurplus of\n\n&dollar; 4 billion.\n\n  There are 93 Superfund sites in New England.\n Eliminating the dedicated tax-and-fee structure will complicate\n\nrather than simplify the process in an area that needs all the help it can\n\nget.\n Cosmologists have long sought evidence\n\non the age of the universe as well as the ages of its stars and galaxies and\n\nhave developed through theory and observation some confidence in their\n\njudgment about each.\n However, they have recently been discovering stars that appear to be\n\nsignificantly older than the roughly 10 billion years they have believed is\n\nthe age of the universe.\n\n  There is widespread, though not total, agreement among scientists\n\nthat the universe as we now recognize it began in the Big Bang.\n An unimaginable detonation unleashed all matter, transforming it from\n\nnear-nothing through a fantastically rapid process into shapes that evolved\n\ninto stars and galaxies.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "303d1e66-fc47-4cdc-a1ab-abbc44a62e4d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.763295+00:00"}
{"text": "pointed out that John argues in this passage that\n\nthe evidence that we are indeed followers of Christ is that we love our\n\nfellow-Christians.\n ( Read the passage for yourselves & see if you agree with him.\n I think he 's right.)\n Also, if we live as a true family, loving one another, caring for one\n\nanother, and supporting one another, that is the most powerful testimony\n\npossible to the transforming power of the love of Christ in a society marked\n\nby isolation, individualism, and superficiality.\n For both of these reasons, the relationships among the staff are\n\ncrucial.\n He adds that he sees the main problems of our society, one of which is\n\ndrugs, as stemming from lack of self-esteem and unfulfilled needs for love;\n\nthus, if people see that our self-esteem comes from Christ, and that our need\n\nfor love is met both by Christ and by the community of Christians, they will\n\nsit up and take notice.\n I'm afraid I haven't captur 'm the power of what he said, but the raw\n\nbones of it are here.\n\n  Now for the frustrations--and I would really appreciate your\n\nprayers about these.\n First of all, disorganization is rampant here at Harambee.\n It 's not as bad as it could be, but to be frank, if I'd been in\n\n'dharge of our orientation, I could have easily cut out four or five hours of\n\nmeetings.\n For example, in terms of teaching us the schedule, what was really\n\nneeded was one comprehensive accurate schedule to be handed out, but instead\n\nwhat we got was several incomplete schedule handouts and several inaccurate\n\nword-of-mouth descriptions; there was lack of communication between  Dick\n\nPickles and  Jim Wallace, the co-directors, which resulted in many\n\nmid-week changes; and the group of interns from Inter-Varsity were not with\n\nus until near the end of orientation, which resulted in a lot of repeating.\n There were also problems with not getting some information to some of\n\nthe interns, so they were constantly asking questions that had been already\n\nanswered.\n Also, most of the interns are not very punctual people, so that\n\nresults in wasting even more time.\n I was anticipating some lack of organization, so at the beginning of\n\nthe week I was pretty patient, but on Friday ( today) I got really\n\nexasperated.\n I know that I'll be encoun 'lling more and more of this as the summer\n\ngoes on, so I am praying fervently for patience.\n I also have a lot of bureaucracy to face; I can't start a bank\n\naccount until I have a CA driver 's license, and I want to be licensed to\n\ndrive fifteen-passenger vans ( to transport kids around), but in CA that is\n\nconsidered to be a commercial license with an exhaustive exam that 's\n\ndifferent from the regular driver 's test and involves learning a lot of\n\ndetail about auto maintenance ( which I'm happy to do, but 'mght now when I\n\nwant my license quickly is Spain).\n Coming on top of today 's disorganization, this aggravated me further.\n Finally, the last straw at dinner today was being advised that it was\n\nunwise for me to be out walking or running alone after dinner ( before dark,\n\neven) on a Friday night, just when I most wanted to just bust out of the\n\nhouse and really work off a lot of the frustrations.\n No one else was interested in going out, and I would have preferred\n\nto go alone anyway. So, I'm facing a lot rig 'm now, and of course it 's all\n\nintensified by trying to adjust to a new place and new people on the heels of\n\nfour very intense weeks.\n I know, I am convinced, that there is an element of spiritual warfare\n\nin all this, that the Enemy of God will use every little way of wearing me\n\ndown possible, that I must not allow these hassles to distract me from the\n\nmain issues .So, your prayers would be much appreciated.\n Prayer would also be really appreciated for the kids who are coming\n\nto the day camp, that they would acquire self-confidence, self-discipline,\n\nand self-esteem, a love of learning, and a love of God.\n That 's about the most that can be asked for them.\n Please be praying for the staff too, that the eleven of us all packed\n\ninto one fairly small house and cooking & eating together could really be a\n\nloving community,-that friction could be minimal and that mutual support and\n\nencouragement could be maximal. \n\n  Many of the same things are still issues, particularly building\n\ncommunity in the house.\n Last weekend, this was a real problem.\n Three of the house residents are still teenagers ( two high school\n\nseniors and one recent high school graduate), and their level of\n\nresponsibility and maturity is on the low side compared to the rest of us.\n In addition, the ages here range from 17 to 30; there is also a\n\nmarried couple with a little baby.\n You can imagine that the lifestyles desired by the eleven of us vary\n\ngreatly!\n However, things have been better over the last few days.\n It 's easy to talk about how wonderful Christian community should be,\n\nand how nice it sounds to be working in partners hip, but most of us assume t\n\nhat we choose the people with whom we would live in such a community.\n The eleven of us did not choose each other, and probably would not\n\nhave given the choice.\n For that reason, I think we're lear 'reg a lot more than we might have\n\notherwise, and being challenged to love people whom we otherwise would not\n\nhave.\n So, I'm excited abou 'mthat even though there are nights when I just\n\nwant to take my dinner to my room rather than listen to  Jimson and\n\n Solidad rag on each other.\n I 'm particularly 'mxcited about the way this effort to build\n\ncommunity has brought me to my knees in prayer.\n I recognize that it is something that God has to do, that we can' t\n\ndo by ourselves , and that demands faithful believing prayer .\n and I have been praying together before going to sleep\n\nevery night for half an hour or so, and it has been good.\n Prayer has knit us close together and helped us both keep our sanity,\n\nand seeing answers to our prayers has reminded us both how faithful and good\n\nGod is.\n We've made 'vere to keep some of that prayer time for thanksgiving,\n\nand that has also been very good.\n There has been so much to be thankful for, too!\n Highlights of the week with the kids: the hardest thing, is to know\n\nhow much to be strict with them and how much we can just let them be kids\n\nwithout their getting out of hand.\n They definitely have to be kept under tight rein, but, for example,\n\ncan they be allowed to run around playing tag without having it turn into a\n\npushing, shoving, and hitting free-for-all? These kids have a much lower\n\nlevel of self-discipline ( as a whole group, that is) than any of the kids\n\nI'm familiar wi 'm.\n Also, can they be allowed to just explore stuff that we put on the\n\ntables during science class time--i.e. rocks, plants, shells, magnifying\n\nglasses--without pushing and hitting each other, grabbing, not taking turns,\n\nand so on?\n Achieving this balance has been tough, and I certainly haven't done a\n\nperfect job.\n I think I'm making prog 'mss, though.\n I would really appreciate prayers for two of the kids, Matthew and\n\nDaniel.\n They are two of the brightest kids in our ( second grade) class.\n They are also the two least disciplined, at least so far. Daniel is\n\njust plain disrespectful; Matthew has a really quick temper and no attention\n\nspan.\n With Matthew it seems that rather than deliberately flaunting\n\nauthority, as it seems that Daniel does, he just doesn't remember what the\n\nrules are .\n I've had 'vediscipline them both a lot, and I've had 'veot of\n\nencounters with Matthew 's mother and two uncles.\n I'm very hop 'mul with Matthew,, because his two uncles are both\n\ninvolved in his growing up to some extent ( both are Christians, married,\n\nwith kids of their own) and want to see him gain the self-discipline that he\n\nhasn't been taught by his mother or his mother 's boyfriend.\n Both have disciplined him this week, which has helped.\n Daniel I'm less su 'm of .\n I Im not sure what it will take to get him to respect me .\n Anyway, God has made me able to really love these kids, at least most\n\nof the time.\n I really want to see them turn around this summer, and I hope that\n\nthey will.\n Other issues: I 'm not sur 'mif tljoki ( my co-teacher) and I are\n\ndoing a very good job with planning lessons .\n Holding the kids' attention has been very tough, especially with f if\n\nteen of them.\n lie' ve been trying to do as much hands-on stuff as possible , and\n\nwe've be 'vedividing them into two smaller groups and each working with one.\n Some things have worked , some haven' t Please pray that we could\n\nlearn from our mistakes and learn to plan lessons that would be exciting for\n\nthe kids.\n Also, I'm findin 'mthe ( expected) difficulty of really fitting into\n\nthe black community here as more than a respected outsider.\n I certainly didn't expect that it would have happened already; I\n\nexpect it to take quite a bit of time.\n Nevertheless, it 's tough being aware of this cultural divide,\n\nparticularly between me and  Dirk.\n ( J.W.), who directs the day camp, is easier for\n\nme to relate to, I think because al-though he is black he is also from the\n\nEast rather than the South, and, as he himself says, there are ways he has\n\nbeen \" whitewashed.\"\nand I have had no problems at all getting along, which\n\nhas been a real blessing - - and I thank God so much for making us\n\nroom-mates--but I think at least part of that is that she goes to a small\n\nliberal-arts college and thus we have that in common.\n Further reasons for thanksgiving: First of all, thank you all so much\n\nfor your letters.\n I've b 've getting mail almost every day--it 's been great! Many of the\n\nkids do seem motivated to learn and to grow, so if we can just eliminate the\n\ndisruptions, I think they'l 'llave a really fun and productive summer.\n Also, I am very hopeful that we'l 'lle able to make a significant\n\ndifference in a lot of the kids' lives, particularly those whose parents or\n\nrelatives have been involved in helping discipline them ( such as Matthew).\n We interns have been meeting twice a week to discuss issues in\n\nChristian community development, such as racial reconciliation and the nature\n\nof Christian community, and those discussions have been challenging and\n\nexciting.\n Finally, my two outside friends, Jim Stipe ( who comes and volunteers\n\nwith my class Wednesdays) and  Soyoun Min, have been a welcome refuge\n\nwhen I'v 'veeeded to escape.\n has also loaned me a guitar to use with the kids'\n\nsinging in the mornings ( he brings his bass guitar and plays on Wednesdays),\n\nand so I'v 'veeen able to play a lot, both with the kids and for sanity 's\n\nsake.\n I' 'mtemporarily without my tape player, so I' 'mlearning to get along\n\nwithout it ( which is good) and enjoying being able to accompany myself to\n\nmake music.\n I could write lots more, but I think it 's about time to stop.\n I am definitely growing, and being stretched and purified by fire\n\nhere!\n Philippians 1 has been very meaningful to me lately.\n I know your prayers are lifting me up, and I 'm very grateful for all\n\nof that.\n I 'm praying for all of you folks as well.\n \" Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present\n\nyou before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy--to the\n\nonly God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus\n\nChrist our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore!

{"text": "Plastic muscles and silicon senses blur the line between man and\n\nmachine.\n\n  In a cluttered lab at the University of New Mexico, a replica of a\n\nhuman skeleton slowly\u0013very slowly\u0013pedals an exercise bicycle.\n\n\n  Myster Bony, as he 's called, is moving the pedals with artificial\n\nmuscles powered by a battery. \n\n  It 's been 40 years since Swedish engineer Arne Larsson received\n\nthe first fully implanted cardiac pacemaker at the Karolinska Institute in\n\nStockholm.\n Since then, researchers throughout the world have looked for ways to\n\nimprove people 's lives with artificial, bionic devices.\n\n\n \n\n  Their efforts have produced smaller and smaller pacemakers,\n\ndevices that help deaf children hear and implantable pumps that carry the\n\nload for diseased hearts until suitable human transplants can be found. \n\n  As for the future, it looks decidedly more natural than the\n\ncyborg technology envisioned at the dawn of the bionic age.\n Take Myster Bony.\n His muscles are made of materials called ionic polymer metal\n\ncomposites ( IPMCs) that respond to electricity with elasticity and\n\nresponsiveness similar to those shown by human muscles.\n The materials were developed by a team led by Mohsen Shahinpoor,\n\ndirector of the Artificial Muscle Research Institute ( AMRI) at the\n\nUniversity of New Mexico ( UNM). \n\n  Strips of these composites can bend and flap dramatically when an\n\nelectric current is applied.\n In this sense they are large-motion actuators\u0013they can move and exert\n\nforce.\n Conversely, when a strip is bent, voltage is produced across its\n\nthickness, allowing the strip to behave like a sensor that can determine a\n\ngiven level of force and motion.\n These two abilities\u0013to move and to provide feedback\u0013 drive Myster\n\nBony on his exercise bicycle.\n\n\n  Another type of artificial muscle being developed at AMRI is made\n\nof a synthetic fiber that has been baked and boiled in a chemical solution.\n The treatment imparts strength and gives the fabric elasticity that\n\nvaries in the presence of an electric current.\n The result: materials that can expand and contract just like living\n\ntissue. \n\n  Researchers envision a synthetic muscle that could translate\n\nelectrical impulses from the nervous system into motion.\n However, that goal is still a long way off.\n In the short term, Shahinpoor believes artificial muscles could be\n\nused to boost the strength of ailing hearts, eliminating some heart\n\ntransplants.\n He also imagines exoskeletons for disabled patients or astronauts,\n\nartificial larynxes, and sensors for diagnosing spinal-cord injuries.\n Eventually, his synthetic muscles could be attached to artificial\n\ntendons, which recently have been approved by the Food and Drug\n\nAdministration for use in human patients. \n\n\n  Artificial muscles aren't the only electromechanical tools being\n\ndeveloped to facilitate human movement.\n This past summer, Campbell Aird, a hotel owner in Scotland, received\n\na bionic arm that had been developed by the Prosthetics Research and\n\nDevelopment Team at Princess Margaret Rose Orthopedic Hospital in Edinburgh.\n The arm uses electronics for control and power.\n Known as EMAS ( Edinburgh Modular Arm System), the arm is equipped\n\nwith battery-powered motors and epicyclical gearboxes.\n It replaced the prosthetic limb Aird had worn since his own right arm\n\nwas amputated 16 years ago as a result of cancer. \n\n  The motors in Aird 's arm are mounted inside lightweight, rigid\n\ntubes of carbon fiber.\n The gearboxes are connected to a worm-and-wheel assembly that\n\nconverts the mechanical power of the gearbox into rotary motion.\n The smallest motors and gearboxes power fingers and the thumb, while\n\nlarger motors power the wrist, elbow and shoulder.\n\n\n  David Gow, head of the team that developed the device, says EMAS\n\nwas the first prosthesis to have a fully powered electrical shoulder.\n In previous artificial arms, power had been limited to wrists, elbows\n\nand hands.\n\n\n  Modern prostheses like Aird 's new arm have a wider range of\n\nmotion than ever before and look more like the limbs they're replac 're.\n Take the case of 10-year-old Melissa Del Pozzo.\n Melissa was born without a left hand and lower forearm.\n Recently, in tests at Rutgers University in New Jersey, she was able\n\nto make electrical traces on a computer screen by moving either a tendon or a\n\nmuscle that would have been used to flex her thumb, if she had one.\n A sensor attached to the skin just below Melissa 's elbow detected the\n\nslight movements and relayed them to the computer screen. \n\n  Melissa will soon be outfitted with what just may be the first\n\ndexterous prosthesis.\n To fit her with a hand and control apparatus, researchers at Rutgers'\n\ndepartment of biomedical engineering, in Piscataway, N. J., will fashion a\n\nsilicone sleeve equipped with pressure sensors inside.\n On top of the sleeve will sit a hard plastic socket that serves as an\n\nexoskeleton on which to anchor the hand.\n The hand itself is a commercial wooden product used on other\n\nprostheses.\n It is fitted with electromagnets that move each of three fingers\n\nseparately.\n When a tendon moves, the sensor, which consists of a small diaphragm,\n\nemits a puff of air that travels through a tube to a transducer.\n In turn, the transducer senses the pressure and transmits a precise\n\nelectric signal to the artificial hand. \n\n  William Craelius, the principal researcher and an associate\n\nprofessor of biomedical engineering at Rutgers, decided to focus on a\n\ntendon-actuated system because previous teams had found it difficult to\n\nisolate the muscle groups that can move individual fingers.\n Eventually, the dexterous prosthesis may allow amputees to do such\n\npreviously impossible tasks as playing musical instruments and typing. \n\n\n  Providing power to run bionic implants and making connections to\n\nthe brain 's control system pose the two great challenges for biomedical\n\nengineering. \n\n  In the mid-1970s, Medronics, a leading medical engineering firm,\n\nwas trying to develop a nuclear-powered heart pacemaker.\n About the same time, engineers at Drexel University in Philadelphia\n\nmaintained a dog 's heartbeat using pacemakers with a fuel cell that ran on\n\nthe electricity generated by chemical reactions between the dog 's body and a\n\nblock of aluminum.\n Neither alternative energy source proved practical.\n For now, and perhaps decades to come, batteries of all shapes and\n\nsizes will figure large in the future of bionics. \n\n  As for controlling movement, the ultimate goal is to tap into the\n\nnervous system.\n Researchers at the University of Michigan ( UM) Center for Neural\n\nCommunication Technology are attempting to do just that.\n Here, they've de 'veoped probes so precise they can stimulate or\n\ndetect signals from individual nerve cells.\n The probes ( right) are only about the size of the date stamped on a\n\npenny. \n\n  The probes are made of precisely etched silicon substrates\n\ncovered with thin conductive films, and insulated above and below.\n The upper surface is patterned using a dry etching process.\n Tiny openings on the upper surface of the probe shank are inlaid with\n\ngold or iridium, which are compatible with nerve tissue.\n\n\n  With sponsorship from the National Institutes of Health 's Neural\n\nProsthesis Program, the number of probe designs has grown and UM has provided\n\nmore than 1000 devices to investigators. \n\n\n  One of the most dramatic applications of bionics is the creation\n\nof artificial eyes.\n Artificial retinas, in particular, are showing great promise.\n Researchers have long known that damaged photoreceptors in the eye\n\ncould be bypassed ( see diagram on page 55).\n A device that stimulated the retinal ganglion cells\u0013connected to the\n\noptic nerve\u0013could transmit visual information to the brain.\n Now, a new technology promises to replace the retina, allowing the\n\nblind to see. \n\n  Working jointly, researchers at North Carolina State University,\n\nthe University of North Carolina and Johns Hopkins University have created\n\nthe implantable Artificial Retina Component Chip ( ARCC).\n The ARCC consists of a silicon microchip embedded with photosensor\n\ncells and electrodes.\n It would be implanted near the vision center of the retina.\n Light and images entering the pupil would pass through the ARCC 's\n\nfront surface and strike photosensors on the back of the chip.\n The photosensor array would convert the image pattern of light and\n\ndark into electric impulses, much as a healthy eye 's rods and cones do.\n The impulses would stimulate nerves behind the retina, sending the\n\ninformation to the brain. \n\n  The device is not expected to produce full, clear vision.\n Instead, it would allow the patient to perceive basic shapes, the\n\ndirection of movements, and the boundaries between contrasting objects. \n\n\n  Cochlear transplant research has been around since the 1950s.\n In essence, cochlear implants provide electrical stimulation of the\n\nauditory nerve.\n The implant sends sound waves into the auditory pathway after\n\nconverting them into electrical energy.\n Today, in addition to numerous research institutions developing\n\nbionic hearing devices, several companies are already selling commercial\n\nproducts.\n Although there are differences in each product, they all work\n\nessentially the same way. \n\n  Even in the profoundly deaf, at least one-third of the 30,000\n\nfibers that stimulate the auditory nerve survive and are responsive, capable\n\nof transmitting to the brain 's hearing center.\n\n\n  Unlike hearing aids, which amplify sound, the cochlear implant\u0013or\n\nbionic ear\u0013trades in electricity.\n Surgeons implant the device in the mastoid bone and inner ear through\n\nan incision behind the ear.\n A small speech processor converts sound, picked up by an external\n\nmike, into an electrical signal.\n The signal is fed through the transmitter coil to the implanted\n\nreceiver.\n Electrodes in the inner ear bypass the damaged area of the ear and\n\ncreate a nerve impulse that stimulates the auditory cortex of the brain. \n\n  Artificial cochleas will not benefit all deaf people.\n Adults who have never heard are not suitable candidates, doctors say,\n\nbecause the auditory part of their brains will not respond to the stimuli.\n\n\n\n  In an entirely different approach, Jonathan Spindel, a biomedical\n\nengineer and assistant professor at the University of Virginia 's department\n\nof otolaryngology, is developing an implanted \" invisible\" magnetic hearing\n\naid.\n \" Our tests to date have shown that the signals produced with our\n\nmagnetic hearing device are very nearly those of natural acoustic sound,\"\n\nsays Spindel. \n\n  In this approach, the device captures sounds with a miniature\n\nmicrophone implanted in the ear.\n After passing through a small processing unit and an electromagnetic\n\ncoil, both also implanted, amplified vibrations would be sent to the inner\n\near via a tiny magnet attached to the inner ear 's round window, a thin\n\nmembrane at one end of the cochlea.\n The magnet, about as large as a pencil point, would send vibrations\n\nthrough the cochlea, stimulating the thousands of hair cells used in normal\n\nhearing. \n\n  Spindel says an advantage of his approach is that the device\n\ndoesn't obstruct the normal hearing process.\n \" Establishing a second independent input pathway to the inner ear\n\nopens the possibility for using the normal acoustic pathway and round window\n\nelectromagnet simultaneously to establish constructive and destructive sound\n\npatterns in the inner ear. \" \n\n  Also, since the new hearing device uses magnetic rather than\n\nacoustic vibrations, feedback\u0013a common problem in conventional hearing\n\naids\u0013is eliminated. \n\n\n  Unlike sight and hearing, scientists know little about the human\n\nsenses of smell and taste.\n Nevertheless, they have been able to re-create these abilities.\n They try to mimic human noses by using sensors that can detect a\n\nvariety of volatile compounds. \n\n  For example, at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories ( ORNL), in\n\nOak Ridge, Tenn., a \" nose on a chip\" is proving able to sniff out mercury,\n\ncarbon monoxide and other chemicals.\n It consists of an array of minuscule sensors on one integrated\n\ncircuit, with the electronics on a separate one.\n By selectively coating the arrays with different chemicals,\n\nresearchers can customize the chip to detect virtually any odor. \n\n  At the University of Texas ( UT) in Austin, researchers have\n\ndeveloped an electronic tongue that mimics the human ability to detect sweet,\n\nsour, salty and bitter tastes.\n To do this, the team attached four different chemical sensors to\n\ntiny beads made of polyethylene glycol and polystyrene.\n The beads were then positioned in micromachined wells on a silicon\n\nwafer.\n The sensors represent various combinations of the four different\n\ntaste elements with combinations of the colors red, green and blue.\n For example, when exposed to an acidic \" taste\" one sensor turns\n\nyellow.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL",

of the Library for its collections or other disposition, it is no longer\n\navailable to the Copyright Office.\n If you wish to register the work, you must deposit additional copies\n\nor phonorecords with your application and fee.\n\n  NOTE: Complete the application form using black ink pen or type.\n You may photocopy blank application forms.\n However, photocopied forms submitted to the Copyright Office must be\n\nclear, legible, on a good grade of 8-1/2-inch by 11-inch white paper suitable\n\nfor automatic feeding through a photocopier.\n The forms should be printed, preferably in

general\n\ndeposit requirements:\n\n  If the work is a motion picture, the deposit requirement is one\n\ncomplete copy of the unpublished or published motion picture and a separate\n\nwritten description of its contents, such as a continuity, press book, or\n\nsynopsis.\n\n  If the work is a literary, dramatic, or musical work published\n\nonly in a phonorecord, the deposit requirement is one complete\n\nphonorecord.\n\n  If the work is an unpublished or published computer program, the\n\ndeposit requirement is one visually perceptible copy in source code of the\n\nfirst 25 and last 25 pages of the program.\n For a program of fewer than 50 pages, the deposit is a copy of the\n\nentire program.\n For more information on computer program registration, including\n\ndeposits for revised programs and provisions for trade secrets, request\n\nCircular 61, \" Copyright Registration for Computer Programs.\"\n\n  If the work is in a CD-ROM format, the deposit requirement is one\n\ncomplete copy of the material, that is, the CD-ROM, the operating software,\n\nand any manual(s) accompanying it.\n If registration is sought for the computer program on the CD-ROM, the\n\ndeposit should also include a printout of the first 25 and last 25 pages of\n\nsource code for the program.\n\n  In the case of works reproduced in three-dimensional copies,\n\nidentifying material such as photographs or drawings is ordinarily required.\n Other examples of special deposit requirements ( but by no means an\n\nexhaustive list) include many works of the visual arts such as greeting\n\ncards, toys, fabrics, oversized materials ( request Circular 40a, \" Deposit\n\nRequirements for Registration of Claims to Copyright in Visual Arts\n\nMaterial\"); video games and other machine-readable audiovisual works (\n\nrequest Circular 61); automated databases ( request Circular 65, \" Copyright\n\nRegistration for Automated Databases\"); and contributions to collective\n\nworks.\n For information about deposit requirements for group registration of\n\nserials, request Circular 62, \" Copyright Registration for Serials on Form\n\nSE.\"\n\n  If you are unsure of the deposit requirement for your work, write\n\nor call the Copyright Office and describe the work you wish to register.\n\n  An unpublished collection is not indexed under the individual\n\ntitles of the contents but under the title of the collection.\n\n\n  A copyright registration is effective on the date the Copyright\n\nOffice receives all the required elements in acceptable form, regardless of\n\nhow long it then takes to process the application and mail the certificate of\n\nregistration.\n The time the Copyright Office requires to process an application\n\nvaries, depending on the amount of material the Office is receiving.\n\n  If you apply for copyright registration, you will not receive an\n\nacknowledgment that your application has been received ( the Office receives\n\nmore than 600,000 applications annually), but you can expect:\n\n  A letter or a telephone call from a Copyright Office staff member\n\nif further information is needed or\n\n  A certificate of registration indicating that the work has been\n\nregistered, or if the application cannot be accepted, a letter explaining why\n\nit has been rejected.\n\n  Requests to have certificates available for pickup in the Public\n\nInformation Office or to have certificates sent by Federal Express or another\n\nmail service cannot be honored.\n\n  If you want to know the date that the Copyright Office receives\n\nyour material, send it by registered or certified mail and request a return\n\nreceipt. <b> CORRECTIONS AND AMPLIFICATIONS OF EXISTING REGISTRATIONS\n\n  To

{"text": "Alice Stone Blackwell, a former suffragette and an internationally\n\nrecognized champion of human rights, occupied a seat of honor at the 1939\n\ndramatic interpretation of the Life of her mother, Lucy Stone.\n Because the eighty-one year-old Blackwell was now blind, she relied on\n\nsounds to convey the images portrayed on the stage.\n Blackwell was pleased.\n The passage of the Nineteenth Amendment guaranteed the vote for women,\n\nand at the same time, the  \u001cLucy Stone\u001d play, along with\n\nBlackwell 's earlier literary tribute to her mother,  Lucy Stone: Pioneer\n\nof Women 's Rights  , assured that Stone would continue to hold an\n\nhonored position in the history of woman 's suffrage.1\n\n  After the performance, Blackwell returned to the bleak isolation\n\nof her apartment.\n Aside from the newspapers and books which cluttered the rooms, the\n\nonly decorations were paintings of her family, a group photograph of the\n\npioneers of the women 's rights movement, and a portrait of her Armenian\n\ngodson.\n The reputations of her famous Blackwell relatives cast a long shadow\n\nover Alice Stone Blackwell, but ultimately, with the woman 's suffrage\n\nvictory, her own separate identity emerged through literature, and through\n\nher support for international human rights.\n While her public career was filled with notable achievements,\n\nprivately Blackwell failed to develop the positive self-images necessary to\n\nfully embrace life.\n Now in her twilight years, she was a nervous recluse, living off the\n\ncharity of family and friends, and she was only visited regularly by a hired\n\nreader.\n\n  As Blackwell retired for the evening, her thoughts may well have\n\ndrifted back to the closing scene of the play, triggering memories of a\n\npromise she had made to her mother ten days before Lucy Stone 's death in\n\nOctober of 1893. \n 'My brave\n\ndaughter! She will go on with the work just the same\n3 Alice\n\nStone Blackwell was compelled to adopt the mission in life prescribed by her\n\nmother.\n Lucy Stone was not a brutal oppressor, and there was genuine love\n\nwithin the Stone Blackwell family, but her obsession with the single goal of\n\nwoman 's suffrage dwarfed the preferences of all those around her, including\n\nthose of her daughter.\n\n  Nineteenth-century reformers present a paradox of opportunities.\n While demanding fuller public lives for women, their commitment to\n\nthe cause limited not only their own choices, but also those of their\n\nfamilies.\n Lucy Stone never intended to stifle her daughter 's vitality; she most\n\ncertainly believed that she was opening new horizons through her suffrage\n\nwork.\n Yet, Stone 's single overpowering commitment to her mission created an\n\nunnatural environment for her only child, It remains to be proven whether\n\nAlice Stone Blackwell 's experience was typical for the daughters of\n\nstrong-minded women of the time period.\n Other daughters followed their mothers into reform work, but there is\n\nno research that indicates that they followed Alice 's pattern.\n Perhaps an understanding of Blackwell 's life will serve as a test\n\ncase to determine the reform movement 's impact on the family life of the\n\nreformers.\n\n  The eventful lives of Lucy Stone and Alice Stone Blackwell\n\nencompassed the two generations that secured the franchise for women.\n Along with the first female college graduate in Massachusetts, an\n\nearly abolition lecturer, and the first woman to refuse to take her husband 's\n\nlast name, Stone established the American Woman 's Suffrage Association, and\n\nfounded  The Woman 's Journal  , along with her husband, Henry\n\nBlackwell, Alice Stone Blackwell was an instrumental auxiliary to Lucy\n\nStone 's strong leadership.\n The\n\nWoman 's Journal  after her mother and father retired from the paper, was\n\ncredited with reconciling two rival suffrage organizations into the National\n\nAmerican Woman 's Suffrage Association, and during the excitement of the\n\nsuffrage victory, she was nominated as the Association 's candidate for\n\npresident.\n After women won the right to vote, Blackwell wrote several books and\n\nbecame actively involved in many liberal causes.4\n\n  Because previous historians have demonstrated the significance of\n\nboth women to the suffrage movement, it is unnecessary to explore their\n\nnotable political and professional accomplishments.\n The focus here is on the complexities of the remarkable\n\nnineteenth-century mother-daughter relationship between Lucy Stone and Alice\n\nStone Blackwell.\n\n  Born in 1818, Lucy Stone was the eighth of nine children, who\n\nwere raised on a Massachusetts farm by Congregational parents.\n She described her father, Francis Stone, as cold and distant: he\n\ndrank heavily, favored her younger sister Sarah.\n and ridiculed Lucy 's physical appearance.\n Unable to please her father, Lucy developed an introspective,\n\nresolute disposition.\n For example, in early childhood, after losing her temper and\n\napparently screaming at her sister, Lucy determined to rid her behavior of\n\nany further outward displays of anger.\n While Francis Stone 's nature mellowed over the years, and he\n\neventually valued his daughter 's many accomplishments, Lucy continued the\n\npattern of the exacting self-analysis she had established during her\n\nchildhood.5\n\n  Hannah Stone, Lucy 's mother, not only was a keeper of the home\n\nwho was burdened with all the household chores that large families demanded,\n\nbut she was also hampered in her domesticity by her husband 's miserliness.\n To ease her mother 's work-load, Lucy washed clothes for the family of\n\nten before school, and then skipped lunch in order to hurry home and take the\n\nclothes off the line.\n \u001cI loved her [ Hannah Stone]\n\nmore than I did him [ Francis Stone], for she was always kind to\n\nus&\"6\n Throughout her life, Lucy Stone endeavored to right the wrongs\n\ncommitted against her mother.\n\n I trust my mother sees, and knows how glad I am to have been born,\n\nand at a time when there was so much that needed help, at which I could\n\n \u001clend a hand.\u001d Dear old mother! She had a hard life, and was\n\nsorry she had another girl, to share and bear the hard life of a woman.\n But I am wholly glad I came, and she is too, if she sees.\n\n\n  Earlier studies have characterized Lucy 's mother as subservient.\n However, the fact that she fulfilled the role that the nineteenth\n\ncentury provided for her does not necessarily indicate that she endorsed her\n\nsubordinate status.\n Hannah 's words and actions revealed evidence of malcontent.\n At Lucy 's birth, Hannah remarked that she regretted having a girl,\n\nbecause life was so hard for women.\n Years later, Hannah wrote Lucy a letter that contained her insight\n\non marriage.  \n \" What do you think about Sarah [ Lucy 's sister]?\n I think she is very unwise [ to get married] for I do not think she\n\nloves him as she ought.\n\n\n  Pivotal to the development of Lucy 's feminist thought was the\n\ncollusion necessary between mother and daughter in their everyday-life\n\nstruggles with the domineering Francis Stone.\n In order to buy needed household goods, Hannah regularly stole small\n\namounts of change from her husband 's purse, and she included Lucy in a scheme\n\nto sneak extra cheeses out of the storehouse, to sell in town.\n Once, as Lucy was about to leave with some cheese, her father\n\nappeared unexpectedly.\n \u001cI was as strong as a young buck.\n I held the cheese, which must have weighed twenty pounds, close to\n\nme, under my arm, while I led the horse out with the other arm.\"9\n\n  While the impact of Hannah 's subtle defiance was not expressly\n\nrecorded, it can be extrapolated from family actions.\n and from comments made in later years.\n When Lucy wanted to attend college, her father may have thought it\n\nunwise, but he did not forbid it and he eventually even helped financially.\n Like most nineteenth-century men, Francis Stone questioned the\n\npropriety of a woman speaking to mixed audiences, but he did attend a lecture\n\nby his daughter.\n\n\n\u001cYou were right, and I was wrong.\"10\n Lucy 's brothers supported her ambitions, despite the ridicule they\n\nwould undoubtedly receive through her notoriety.\n \u001cI think with\n\nyour feelings in relation to women 's rights, you are fully justified in the\n\ncourse you have taken....\"11\n Another brother handed over his church pulpit, for Lucy to give a\n\nsuffrage message.\n Such sentiments and actions lent credence to the supposition that\n\nthe Stone family, under Hannah 's influence, came to question what the proper\n\nrole for women should be.\n\n\n  Lucy Stone 's obsession with women 's rights resulted from her\n\nyouthful conflict between the dictates of her religion and her emerging\n\nfeminist thought.\n When Lucy read in the Bible that it was a woman 's duty to submit to\n\nmen, she was not comforted by her mother 's explanation that it was the curse\n\nof Eve.\n Lucy determined to learn Hebrew and Greek, for she had no doubt that\n\nmen had mistranslated the pertinent passages.\n Never reassured by her Biblical exegesis, Lucy, like many other\n\nnineteenth-century reformers, eventually left the Congregational Church and\n\njoined the more liberal Unitarian Church.12\n\n  \u001cA Comparison of\n\nPsychohistorical Differences Among Some Female Religious and Secular\n\nLeaders,\u001d described how new religions were often created from inner\n\nconflicts, such as those suffered by Lucy Stone.\n Stone never established a denomination, but her devotion to women 's\n\nrights acquired all the trapping of a religion.\n was all important.\n and one 's personal needs were to be sacrificed for the greater good\n\nof womankind.\n Throughout her life, Stone judged herself and others by their\n\nfaithfulness to the mission.13\n\n  Lucy 's dedication to woman 's suffrage left no room for a\n\npersonal life.\n Like many other pioneers of the movement, she refused to compromise\n\nher independence by marrying.\n Her ambivalent feelings over her decision are evident in a letter to\n\nAntoinette Brown, Lucy 's future sister-in-law, in August of 1849, in which\n\nshe explained that she was staying single in spite of the fact that she would\n\nlike to be married.  \n My heart aches to love somebody that shall be all its own.\n I have not yet reached the place where I need no companionship as\n\nyou have.\n Do you think I am silly?\n Say so if you do.\n Don't give yourself any uneasiness on my account, for I shall not be\n\nmarried ever.14\n\n  Unexpectedly, Lucy Stone found romance with reformer Henry\n\nBlackwell.\n Initially Stone resisted Blackwell, who was seven years younger than\n\nshe, but in time it became increasingly difficult for her to refute his\n\ncarefully laid arguments on the feasibility of their marriage.\n To convince Lucy to relent on her vow of celibacy, Henry agreed to\n\ndevote the rest of his life to women 's rights.\n This made for an unusual marriage, for while Henry was already an\n\nabolitionist, who was not unsympathetic to the suffrage issue, until he fell\n\nin love with Lucy it is doubtful that this movement would have received so\n\nmuch of his attention.15\n\n  In 1857, thirty-nine year-old Lucy Stone, the nation 's leading\n\nwomen 's rights spokesperson, put everything on hold to have and raise her\n\nonly child, Alice.\n There is no difficulty in understanding her family-oriented goals,\n\nfor Stone, a conservative among feminists, accepted the ideology of separate\n\nspheres, believing that woman 's ultimate responsibility was to her family.\n However, her decision to retire from the movement made her depressed\n\nand unsure of herself.\n\n I went to hear E.P. Whipple lecture on Joan d'Arc.\n It was very inspiring, & for the hour I felt as though all things\n\nwere possible to me.\n But when I came home & looked in Alice 's sleeping face & thought of\n\nthe possible evil that might befall her if my guardian eye was turned away, I\n\nshrank like a snail into its shell, & saw that for these years I can only be\n\na mother \u0013 no trivial thing either.16\n\n  As Lucy 's despondency grew, Henry insisted that for her own sake\n\nshe had to return to her career.\n Alice, still young when Lucy resumed active campaigning, was often\n\nleft with relatives while both her parents travelled to suffrage meetings and\n\nundertook extensive lecture tours.\n Their absences made Alice feel insecure.\n Recognizing her anxiety, Lucy and Henry tried, whenever they could,\n\nto provide a normal home life for their daughter.\n Alice remembered the rare times when her mother was at home for an\n\nextended period of time, and  \u001cwe had the best meals of our lives both\n\nof my parents loved to be at home more than any place else, in spite of the\n\nfact that they were both in the forefront of many a bitter battle.\"17\n\n  Woman 's\n\nJournal  .\n One of the goals in beginning this women 's rights publication was to\n\nhave more family time, yet the paper came to dominate their lives.\n Furthermore, Henry became imbued with a sense of failure, as his\n\nattempts to establish a national reform reputation of his own never met his\n\nexpectations.18\n\n  These external pressures added to Alice 's own internal turmoil\n\nover entering womanhood and striving to establish her own separate identity.\n The result was a power struggle between mother and daughter.\n In the following journal entry seemed to have won the upper\n\nhand:", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "59e4aa61-36f7-46a9-b27c-2dc770e13a2a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.768723+00:00"}
{"text": "The U.S. Mint:\n\n\n\n  United States coins are made at four Mint facilities:\n\nPhiladelphia, Denver, San Francisco, and West Point, NY.\n One easy way to start your collection is with the circulating coins\n\nyou use daily - pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters and dollars.\n In addition, the U.S. Mint also issues annual proof and uncirculated\n\nsets, national medals, and commemorative coins. \n\n \n\n\n  In January 1999, a unique and historically compelling 10-year\n\ncelebration of the states began. For the 50 State Quarters(tm) Program, a\n\nseries of five quarter-dollars with new reverses will be issued each year\n\nuntil 2008. All 50 states will be honored in the order they joined the Union.\n\n\n\n\n  Each year, the U.S. Mint packages sets of the proof and the\n\nuncirculated coins that were produced during the year and sometimes the\n\nprevious year.\n You can purchase current - year sets directly from the Mint.\n Generally, for prior years, you will need to buy the sets from coin\n\ndealers or other collectors. \n\n\n  Unlike circulating coins, proof coins display brilliant\n\nmirror-like backgrounds, with frosted, sculpted foregrounds. \n\n\n\n  These coins are struck using the same process for circulating\n\ncoins, but they have quality enhancements - slightly higher coining force,\n\nearly strikes from dies, special cleaning after stamping, and protective\n\npackaging in Mylar(r). \n\n\n\n  Authorized by Congress, commemorative coins typically celebrate\n\nand honor American people, places, events, or institutions. They are\n\ngenerally available directly from the U.S. Mint for a limited time only. They\n\nmay remain available from collectors and coin dealers thereafter. Sales of\n\nthese coins can benefit the organizations authorized by Congress in the\n\ncommemorative coin legislation. \n\n\n  These platinum, gold, or silver proof coins are produced from\n\nindividually selected planchets that have been polished to a high luster.\n\nThey are struck at least twice on specially adapted coining presses, bringing\n\neven the most minute of details with remarkable clarity. The finished proof\n\ncoin, with its frosted cameo image on a mirror-like field, is then\n\nwhite-glove inspected and placed in special packaging designed to help\n\nprotect and present its showmanship. \n The U.S. Mint produces these\n\nselective awards authorized by Congress. National medals commemorate the\n\nnation 's significant historical events or honor individuals whose superior\n\ndeeds and achievements have enriched our nation or the world. When\n\nlegislation permits, bronze duplicates may be struck for sale to the public.\n\nFor example, in 1999, bronze replicas were available for the gold medals\n\nhonoring Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela. \n\n\n  In addition, the U.S. Mint periodically produces special editions\n\nof its products, such as first-day coin covers, coin and die sets, as well as\n\nitems such as coin jewelry and holiday ornaments that feature coins. \n\n\n  Most error coins and misstrikes are found and recycled before\n\nthey ever leave the U.S. Mint. The few that do make it into circulation,\n\nthough, are often perceived to be collectibles. Collectors classify these\n\ncoins into three major categories: die errors, planchet errors, and striking\n\nerrors. Within each, there are also subcategories, such as off-center\n\nstrikes, overdates, and multiple-struck coins that are of significant\n\ninterest to some collectors. You can learn more about this category through\n\nnational error clubs, coverage of errors in numismatic publications, and the\n\nformal cataloging of mint errors. \n\n  It 's easy to start a coin collection.\n You can begin with coins that you already have on hand.\n Check your pockets, wallet, desk drawers and under the sofa cushions.\n Most people are surprised to discover the variety of coins hiding in\n\ntheir home 's forgotten nooks.\n Then, ask friends and relatives if they have any old or unusual coins\n\nto contribute. \n\n  To organize and display your collection, you may want to purchase\n\none or more coin albums.\n Some are custom-made for specific coins, such as Kennedy Half\n\nDollars; other albums hold all denominations.\n Additional storage and display options include paper envelopes,\n\nplastic tubes, slabs, flips, and Mylar(r) staple holders.\n\n\n  Learning how to become a coin collector also means learning a new\n\nlanguage.\n Coin collectors use a common vocabulary to discuss coins.\n Special terms are used to describe a coin 's condition, value, and\n\nwhat it looks like.\n\n\n\n Here are the basic tools you'll need to 'll started building and\n\norganizing your coin collection: A high-quality magnifying glass so you can\n\nlook at a coin 's tiny details. A padded jeweler 's tray, plush towel, or some\n\nother soft cloth to set coins on when viewing them. A plastic ruler that\n\nmeasures in inches and millimeters.\n Avoid hard, metal rulers that may scratch your coins. A good general\n\ncoin reference book.\n It should include information on dates, mint marks, major varieties,\n\ngrading guidelines, and prices. Good lighting, such as a halogen lamp. Soft,\n\ncotton gloves. Coin envelopes, holders, or albums for storing your coins.\n\n\n\n  There are four questions you should answer when determining\n\nwhether to add a coin to your collection:\n Does the coin have eye appeal?\n What appeals to any individual collector is always subjective.\n If the coin doesn't appeal to you, don't buy it.\n It 's likely that if you think the coin is ugly, other people will\n\ntoo. \n\n  How is the original luster?\n There is no way to restore a coin 's luster - the characteristic\n\nflashy sheen seen on a new coin - once it 's gone. \n\n  Is there any damage?\n Scratches, bag marks, staple marks, corrosion, and other damage will\n\ndecrease a coin 's value. \n\n  How much wear is there?\n According to experts, wear tends to be the single biggest factor that\n\ndetermines the grade given to a coin. \n\n  Should you buy coins for your collection, or is it better to find\n\nthem?\n You certainly can do either - or both.\n The combination approach can be a good way to enhance your\n\ncollection.\n For example, as the new coins in the 50 State Quarters ( tm) Program\n\nare released into circulation ( five per year from 1999 to 2008), you can\n\nsave coins for each state as you find them in your change.\n In addition, you also may want to purchase special collectibles\n\nrelated to the program, such as proof sets, uncirculated sets, or first-day\n\ncoin covers. \n\n  What if you have decided to collect coins from a certain year,\n\nbut you are having trouble finding them?\n Then, you may want to purchase the hard-to-find coins from a coin\n\ndealer or another collector, adding depth and value to your collection. \n\n  Here are some sources to build your collection ( the U.S. Mint\n\ndoes not recommend, regulate, or endorse individual providers of goods or\n\nservices): Your local bank. \n\n  Purchase rolls of coins to search through collectors and coin\n\nclubs.\n Trade or buy from other collectors, either privately or at coin\n\nclubs. \n\n  Purchase coins directly from the U.S. Mint 's catalog, which is\n\nalso available online at www.usmint.gov/catalog. \n\n  Buy or trade with reputable coin dealers.\n You can try using the following venues.\n You may want to ask an experienced collector for dealer referrals.\n\n\n\n  Here you can shop from several dealers at once.\n The selection at coin shows will be much better than at most\n\nindividual shops, and the prices will be more competitive. \n\n  Many dealers sell coins through the mail.\n Check the numismatic publications for their ads.\n Make sure the dealer has a reasonable return policy before ordering,\n\nand examine the coins carefully on receipt to ensure that they're\n\n'reatisfactory. \n\n  Hundreds of dealers - including many conventional mail order\n\nadvertisers - offer coins on the Internet.\n Again, make sure the dealer has a reasonable return policy before\n\nordering, and examine the coins carefully on receipt to ensure that they're\n\n'reatisfactory.\n\n\n  The rarest and most expensive coins often are available only\n\nthrough major auction houses.\n In addition, many collectors now sell coins on auction Web sites.\n ( As with online dealers, make sure the seller has a reasonable\n\nreturn policy and examine the coins carefully upon receipt to ensure that\n\nthey're s 'resfactory.) Note: It is not uncommon for auction bids to surpass\n\nprices of comparable coins sold in other venues.\n It 's a good idea to check prices in shops, mail-order ads, and on\n\nother Web sites in advance.\n Then, to avoid overpaying, limit your bids to the market-value prices\n\nyou've 'vend. \n\n  Although they are not primary sources, sometimes coins can be\n\nfound at these events.\n Because there is less competition for the seller and many potential\n\nbuyers, prices may be inflated.\n In addition, sometimes these venues are used to move problem coins.\n Use caution and common sense when buying at these events.\n\n\n  To retain the value and look of your coin collection, proper care\n\nand storing is essential.\n\n\n While you may be tempted to clean your coins to make them look shiny and\n\nnew - proceed with caution.\n Most of the time, cleaning makes coins look worse and, more\n\nimportantly, reduces their value.\n\n f you absolutely must clean a coin to remove dirt, use good-quality mild\n\nsoap and water.\n Once you've 'vehed the coin, pat it dry with a soft towel.\n Don't brush or rub it, which can scratch the coin 's delicate surface.\n Believe it or not, older coins that show the deep coloration of age\n\nare far more desirable than coins whose surfaces have been stripped away by\n\nimproper cleaning. \n\n  To preserve the value and natural condition of your coins, it is\n\nimportant that you handle them carefully.\n A coin should be held by its edges between the thumb and forefinger.\n This protects the coin 's surface and design from fingerprints and the\n\nnatural oils on your skin that can be corrosive.\n Never hold a coin so that your fingers touch the obverse or reverse\n\nsurface.\n\n\n  Some experienced coin collectors use soft cotton gloves when\n\nhandling their uncirculated or proof coins.\n If you choose not to wear gloves, make sure your hands are clean\n\nbefore handling your coins.\n Also, hold coins over a soft towel or other soft surface in case you\n\ndrop them.\n Finally, don't talk directly over your coins because tiny, almost\n\ninvisible droplets of saliva can drop onto the coin and show up later as\n\nspots.\n Just like fingerprints, those marks are difficult, if not\n\nimpossible, to remove. \n\n  1. Always store your coins in a place that is consistently cool\n\nand dry.\n Sharp changes in temperature and moisture promote tarnish and spots\n\nthat will devalue your coins.\n For instance, don't store your coins in the attic or basement where\n\nthe environment temperature can fluctuate significantly. \n\n  2. Keep your coins in their original holders, if at all\n\npossible.\n All modern proof sets and commemoratives should be bought and sold\n\nin their original cases and capsules. \n\n  3. Save the Certificate of authenticity and the information card\n\nthat comes with U.S. Mint proofs, uncirculated sets, and commemorative sets.\n These items are considered to be part of the set, and if they are\n\nmissing, your coins will be harder to sell. \n\n  4. As your collection becomes more valuable, you may want to\n\nstore it in a safe-deposit box.\n Or, if you choose to keep your collection at home, check with your\n\ninsurance company to make sure it 's covered for the full replacement cost.\n\n\n\n  Flips are clear plastic holders with two pockets - one for the\n\ncoin, the other for a label.\n Some flips, such as those made of Mylar(r), are good for storing\n\ncoins but can be a little stiff and brittle.\n When you put a coin into a flip or take it out, \" bow\" the flip to\n\navoid scratching the coin - press both edges gently to make a wide opening\n\nfor the coin. \n\n  Soft plastic holders aren't always a better alternative.\n You definitely want to avoid them if they contain polyvinyl chloride\n\n( PVC).\n This chemical, used to make plastics softer, will take a valuable\n\ncoin and turn it into a sticky, worthless mess.\n How?\n Over time, the sticky film spreads from the container to your coin,\n\neating into its surface.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6407042e-9888-4f56-bf5c-fc50a6391798", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.770263+00:00"}

{"text": "A US West Communications plan to sell its 60 rural telephone\n\nexchanges and invest the profits in improved telecommunications would be a\n\nboon to Billings, the Montana Public Service Commission Has told Thursday\n\nnight.\n\n  In a public hearing at Parmly Billings Library representatives of\n\nthe city 's business, medical and education communities repeatedly told\n\ncommission members that the sale would boost their ability to compete\n\nnationally and internationally.\n US West plans to sell its exchanges to six rural Montana\n\ncooperatives \n\n  The company asked the PSC to make two declaratory rulings--that\n\nthe sale is in the public 's best interest, and that the gains will go to US\n\nWest and not to ratepayers, said John Alke, attorney for US West.\n\n  In Billings, 13 people voiced their opinions, mainly about the\n\nadvantages of investing money in urban telecommunications systems.\n\n\n  Because of the state 's remote location and its sparse population,\n\nit has been ill-equipped to compete in business, said Jerry Thomas, executive\n\ndirector of the Montana Tradeport Authority.\n \" Recent advancements in computer and telecommunication technology can\n\nchange all this.\n Such advancements have the potential to allow Montana businesses, even\n\nin remote locations, to become competitive.\"\n\n  The Federal Communications Commission also must approve the sale.\n The sale price of the 60 US West telephone properties is\n\n&dollar; 124.8 million.\n US West says its profit on the sale will be\n\n&dollar; 29.2 million, after taxes.\n\n  Through the terms and conditions of the sales agreement, the\n\ncooperatives have agreed to provide equipment upgrades and modernize the\n\nrural exchanges.\n\n  Regardless, US West is committed to modernizing those exchanges,\n\nsaid Mary Wright, attorney for the Montana Consumer Counsel.\n\n  The Montana Consumer Counsel doesn't oppose the sale, she said,\n\nbut favors giving the profit to the ratepayers, instead of US West\n\nshareholders.\n\n  Under the US West plan, the shareholders would invest the profit\n\nin TeleTech, a program to implement high-tech telecommunications in its urban\n\nservice areas, including Billings.\n\n  For instance, more than 170 miles of new fiber-optic cable will\n\nbe installed in Billings, Bozeman, Butte, Great Falls, Helena and\n\nMissoula.\n\n  \" TeleTech is still not free,\" Wright said during a break in the\n\nmeeting.\n \" In the future, US West will expect to get a return of its\n\ninvestment and on its investment, so it 's\n\n&dollar; 28 million at least twice.\n We don't see that the people that are talking tonight have really\n\nbeen exposed to a meaningful discussion of the costs.\"\n\n  Educators, business people and those in the medical field\n\ninsisted that they would be better off with the investment.\n\n  Charles Brooks, a retired businessman, told commission members\n\nthat it is the stockholders who have taken the risks, and they are the ones\n\nwho should profit.\n \" Why should the ratepayer benefit? Has he shared any risk?

Fitz, Larry Jones and Gregory L.\n\nPeterson--will apparently be asking\n\n&dollar; 140,000 in back pay, their attorney, Stephen Mackey of Billings, indicated\n\nduring his questioning of potential jurors.\n\n  MPC attorney Patrick Fleming told the jury that the employees\n\nwere already well compensated for their work, and that the on-call system in\n\nuse was technicians' idea, not the company 's.\n\n  According to Mackey, each of the employees works a 40-hour week.\n But every fourth week, one of the four computer technicians in the\n\ndivision spends the week, including the weekend, on call.\n The employee must stay close enough to a telephone to respond within\n\n15 minutes.\n Each of the technicians is equipped with a pager that must be carried\n\nduring the entire week.\n Mackey said that the range of the pager is only about five miles,\n\nwhich means that the person on call has to remain with a five-mile radius of\n\nthe plant, he said.\n\n  The key issue in the case will be the extent of the limitations\n\nplaced on their lives while they are on call, and how much is fair\n\ncompensation for the disruption in their lives.\n\n  In his opening argument, Mackey said that when Fitz is on call,\n\nhe can't attend church or take classes toward a college degree, and that he\n\nhas also missed his daughter 's Christmas play.\n Mackey said Peterson hasn't been able to spend Christmas or\n\nThanksgiving with his family in Billings, has missed the wedding of a close\n\nfriend and is unable to accept social invitations with people he socializes\n\nwith in his church.\n Mackey said that Jones has missed his daughter 's out-of-town\n\nbasketball games and her solo choir performance in Miles City.\n He said they all have trouble sleeping through the night because of\n\ncalls from the plant or anticipation of calls from the plant.\n\n  Others workers who are on call at the plant aren't tied to\n\nColstrip and have no mandatory call in, Mackey said.\n But the computer technicians are required to be within 15 minutes of\n\nthe plant.\n\n\n  Fleming said that the three workers are already well paid for\n\ntheir time. They get paid more than\n\n&dollar; 30 an hour when they are called out, he said, and they are paid each time\n\nfor a minimum of two hours.\n\n  The MPC attorney said that until 1986 or 1987, the computer\n\ntechnicians did shift work to cover the plant 24 hours a day.\n But the technicians objected to the rotating shifts and asked for an\n\non-call system instead.\n The proposal was apparently made by the fourth technician in the\n\ncomputer group, who will testify for the power company.\n\n  Fleming said that the company said it would not go along with the\n\non-call system unless all the technicians agreed.\n Mackey said that Fitz, the only plaintiff who was working in the\n\ncomputer division at that time, was opposed to the on-call system, but agreed\n\nto go along because all the other technicians wanted it.\n\n  The current system has been fair, flexible and lucrative for the\n\ntechnicians, Fleming said.\n The technicians fix their own on call schedule a year in advance and\n\nsubmit it to MPC.\n The company places no restrictions on their ability to trade on-call\n\ntime, he said.\n\n  Modems were purchased for the technicians so they could work from\n\ntheir homes if they were called.\n He said they can chose to work 10-hour shifts instead of 8-hour\n\nshifts so they can have three-day weekends.\n The technicians are also provided pagers so they can go anywhere in\n\nthe Colstrip community, Fleming said.\n And if the technician is called and it 's inconvenient for him to\n\ncome to the plant right then, the company has always allowed for a delay, he\n\nsaid.\n\n  The case is being heard by U.S. Magistrate Richard Anderson in\n\nBillings.

{"text": "\" simulation of\n\nmusical thinking.\"\n The algorithm presented in this article reflects the author 's approach\n\nto music composition and hence represents one  \" simulation of musical\n\nthinking.\"\n The code based on this algorithm creates new compositions by way of a\n\nreflexive pattern matcher combined with an augmented transition network (\n\nATN).\n This sub-program of Experiments in Musical Intelligence ( EMI)\n\nrequires only that it be loaded with music in a given style.\n While the entire code of the EMI program is not provided, the\n\nalgorithm in Fig.1 and the respective code, as well as the ideas presented in\n\nthe books and articles by the author listed in the bibliography, should serve\n\nas a useful introduction to the EMI program.\n\n  While music naturally includes timbre, dynamics, performance\n\npractice ( Dannenberg 1989), and so on, research with EMI has thus far\n\nfocused exclusively on pitch and duration.\n This is not meant to denigrate other areas of possible study.\n However, this limitation confines the research to a reasonable frame\n\nof reference.\n The program presented in this article further concentrates on pitch\n\nalone due to space constraints.\n\n  has different meanings in\n\nmusic and computer programming.\n \"\n\nfunction\" has when it is referenced.\n However, repeating applicable reference words ( e.g.\n \" computer programming\n\ncode function\") can create a redundant writing style.\n In this article, reference words regarding musical and programming\n\ncode will accompany the initial appearance of the particular use of the word\n\n \" function\" with the understanding that these meanings do not\n\nchange until another reference word is established.\n\n\n  The algorithm of the program to be described in this article is\n\nshown in Fig. 1.\n The input works ( A) are stored in files as separate lists of phrases\n\nof MIDI note numbers ( 36 to 96).\n These works are statistically analyzed ( B) for eventual comparison\n\nto the program 's output to discover whether such output favorably matches the\n\nstyle of the program 's input.\n This analysis includes such parameters as repeated notes, the\n\nstatistic used by the program discussed in this article.\n The statistical analysis also initially sets the program 's variables\n\n( I and J) by loading the variable source file ( K).\n\n  The pattern-matching process ( C) serves as a way of identifying\n\ncertain aspects of musical style ( Cope 1990; Fu 1982).\n Such pattern matching has proven especially useful when the process\n\nis controlled by variables which determine conditions as to how large\n\ngathered motives should be, how exactly a motive must match another, and so\n\non.\n or\n\npatterns found in more than one of the input works.\n Patterns found in two or more works are considered clues as to how\n\ndifferent styles may be recognized.\n The pattern matcher stores the signatures it discovers in a\n\ndictionary ( D) which supplies these, along with the analysis of the works,\n\nfor replication ( E).\n\n  The arrangement of signatures in replicated works is accomplished\n\nthrough the use of an augmented transition network ( ATN - Cope 1987 and\n\n1991; Gazdar and Mellish 1989; Woods 1970) which maneuvers signatures of\n\nvarying lengths to logical rather than random positions.\n This positioning depends on factors inherent in the signatures\n\nthemselves and how well they satisfy certain criteria such as musical\n\nfunction, the focus used in the program described in this article.\n\n  Once a new work is created ( F) it is analyzed statistically ( G)\n\nand that analysis is compared ( H) with the statistical analysis of the input\n\nworks.\n If the comparison is successful ( i.e. comparable percentages of\n\nrepeated notes in this case), then the work is saved in a destination file (\n\nM).\n If the comparison is not successful, then the program 's variables are\n\naltered ( I, J) and the program begins again.\n Successful variable settings are saved for future use ( L).\n The segmented arrows to the files L and M highlight the fact that\n\ncompositions and settings are not saved to destination files unless\n\nsuccessful comparisons of their statistical analyses have occurred.\n Either the source file ( K) or the destination file ( L) of the\n\nvariables may be initially loaded depending on whether default or previous\n\naltered settings are desired.\n\n\n  The following overview should be helpful in cementing the\n\nreader 's understanding of how the program works as well as showing how the\n\ndata appears at various stages.\n Space constraints prohibit giving non-trivial examples.\n However, it is less important for the reader to see complicated\n\noutput than to understand the process that is involved.\n\n  Fig. 2 shows parts of two works used as examples in this article.\n These are the melodies of the opening bars of two piano sonatas by\n\nMozart.\n They are shown in both musical notation and MIDI note numbers.\n The full EMI implementation of this algorithm includes rhythm ( as\n\ndurations) as well as harmony and their associated pattern-matching\n\nprocesses.\n\n  The statistical analysis of this music ( see Fig.\n 1 B) consists of a mathematical sub-program which computes\n\nprevalences of ( in this case) repeated notes.\n Triad outlines, leaps followed by steps, and so on, can also be\n\nuseful tests.\n In the Mozart examples of Fig. 2, 33 percent, or 6 of 18 notes, are\n\nrepeated ( counting initial attacks as well as re-struck notes).\n The fact that all of them occur in one of the works is not important\n\nto the statistical analysis.\n This statistic will be used to ascertain if the new output is similar\n\nenough to the original works to allow it to be saved in a destination file.\n As will be seen, if the new work is not acceptable, then an\n\nappropriate variable is incremented.\n If this variable reaches a point where continued incrementing has\n\nlittle effect, the next variable increases and the former one remains\n\nfixed.\n\n  The pattern-matching program used in the algorithm shown in Fig.\n\n1 matches intervals instead of pitches.\n The number 0 represents a repeated note, 1 is a minor second up, - 1\n\nis a minor second down, and so on.\n Hence, transposition of patterns are the same since intervals are\n\ndevoid of explicit pitch information ( i.e. C E G will match D F# A, or any\n\nmajor triad).\n In the pattern-matching process demonstrated here, intervals are\n\nmatched without reference to direction.\n This automatically matches inversions of patterns such as ( 1 2) as\n\nequivalent to ( - 1 - 2) which is especially useful when small works are used\n\nfor input as is the case in the program to be described here.\n It is less useful ( especially in EMI) when using full-scale works as\n\ninput to the program.\n\n  Fig. 3a shows two signatures and their associated matches\n\ngathered by the function pattern-match shown in Fig.11a in the next section.\n The second of the paired versions of each signature appears somewhat\n\ndifferent.\n However, they match according to the process applied here.\n\n\nmatches  \" ( 0 - 1)\" since when the latter is devoid of\n\nnegatives, as in  \" ( 0 1),\" no element varies by more than\n\none ( acceptable if the appropriate variable is set to allow such variance -\n\nsee *variance* in the next section).\n \" ( 4\n\n3)\" matches  \" ( - 4 - 3)\" since, as mentioned\n\npreviously, negative and positive numbers ( inversions) are treated as equals\n\nin this program.\n\n  Fig. 3b shows a first attempt at replicating a new example in the\n\nstyle of these signatures.\n In order to reflexively check this result against the analysis of the\n\noriginal music, the program analyzes this output exactly as it did the\n\noriginal input works ( B in Fig. 1).\n The comparison module of the algorithm ( H in Fig. 1) then receives\n\nboth the original analysis and the analysis of the current new work ( G in\n\nFig. 1) and compares them.\n If the comparison is unsuccessful, the variables are adjusted in the\n\norder specified by the function make-music ( see relevant discussion of Fig.\n\n9).\n If the comparison is successful, the program saves the new work.\n In this latter case, the program also saves the new settings of the\n\nvariables to a destination file.\n\n  The comparison of the amount of repeated notes found in the\n\noriginal ( 33 percent) and that found in Fig. 3b ( 0 percent) is a\n\nsignificant deviation and thus, in this instance, the work is not saved to a\n\ndestination file.\n Instead, an appropriate variable is reset incrementally.\n The influence of variable re-setting on the pattern-matching process,\n\nhowever, is inversely proportional to that variable 's value: the higher the\n\ncurrent setting the less its impact on the process.\n As mentioned previously, the setting of variables is accomplished by\n\nincrementing one variable at a time.\n These variables have a prioritized order which defaults to another\n\nvariable after exhausting all reasonable attempts with the current variable (\n\ndiscussed further in the next section).\n\n  With the variable controlling size set to 2, variation to 2, and\n\nallowable interpolated notes to 0 the signatures increase significantly from\n\nFig. 3a as shown in Fig. 3c.\n In this case, however, the reverse problem of that shown in Fig. 3b\n\noccurs.\n Even without showing an example, one can readily observe that a\n\nsuccessful comparison cannot easily be possible.\n Using only two signatures, as in Fig. 3b, would result in either 100\n\npercent, 50 percent or 0 percent repeated notes, none of which is even\n\nroughly close to to the 33 percent target.\n\n  With the window size set to 2, variation set to 2 and allowed\n\ninterpolated notes set to 1, the signatures increase still further as shown\n\nin Fig.\n 3d and more repeated-note choices become possible.\n Now, with more signatures to choose from, the example in Fig. 3e is\n\nproduced.\n Obviously, with so little music here, one could not objectively say\n\nthis version is much better an example of the replication of Mozart 's style\n\nthan Fig. 3b.\n In fact, the rhythm of the example here is antagonistic to Mozart 's\n\nstyle.\n In larger examples, however, the statistical analyses, balanced with\n\nthe flexible variables of the pattern matcher and the use of ATN, have\n\nproduced stylistically viable results .\n In Fig. 3e, the 33 percent usage ( 2 out of 6) matches exactly that\n\nof the analysis of the input works.\n\n  As can be seen ( and heard), Fig. 3e does not conform to the\n\nimplied musical functions of either of the input works.\n This is as problematic as the poor rhythmic fit mentioned above.\n This is caused by the random placement of signatures.\n Choosing and rejoining signatures can be made more elegant and\n\nmusical by following the principles inherent in augmented transition\n\nnetworks.\n ATN 's are used in natural language processing ( NLP) to generate new\n\nand logical sentences from parsed word representations ( Winograd 1983).\n They produce like-meaning output in different orders from the input.\n \"\n\nBill sees John.\"  \" Bill has seen John.\"\n These sentences are all\n\nrelated yet different.\n The second sentence varies the first by changing its tense.\n The third sentence resembles Chomsky 's transformational grammar in\n\nthat sentence parts have been transposed ( Chomsky 1965).\n\n  Fig. 4 provides one example of how ATN works.\n The first map is a complete sentence consisting of a noun phrase (\n\nsubject -  \" nps\"), verb phrase (  \" vp1\" or  \"\n\nvp2\"), another noun phrase ( object -  \" npo\"), prepositional phrase (\n\n \" pp\") or proper noun (  \" pn\").\n The two verb phrases represent optional versions of the same\n\nrepresentations.\n refers to a skipping of the step\n\nshown.\n The two interchangeable noun phrases are described in more detail\n\nbelow the sentence structure.\n stands for words such as\n\n \" who,\"  \" what\" or \" where\" used for\n\nqueries.\n =\n\ndeterminator or article;  \" pn\" = proper noun;  \"\n\nmp\" = modifier phrase;  \" n0,\"  \" n1\" (\n\nand so on) = noun; and  \" p\" = preposition.\n By applying certain viability tests ( here between nodes 0 and 2 of\n\nthe top diagram in Fig.4 and shown in the code to be described) and inserting\n\nthe various language parts which pass these recursive tests, a variety of\n\ninteresting statements! and queries may be created from a dictionary of few\n\nactual words.\n\n  ATN 's can be very useful tools for the re-positioning of\n\nsignatures in music as well as other musical materials.\n ATNs allow for the generation of more convincing music in a style\n\nbecause the music thus re-positioned remains functionally ( in musical terms)\n\nspecific.\n Since the original order of musical functions ( i.e. the original\n\nprotocols) is maintained, connecting the re-positioned music helps to create\n\nresults which sound more like the music used for analysis.\n Interestingly, music, unlike language, need not have the tense,\n\nsingular/plural and other rules which make ATNs so complex.\n Details of ATNs in both natural language processing and music are\n\ngiven in the next section.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6b2abae6-c52c-460b-b041-46eb4f98e560", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.774062+00:00"}
{"text": "Elementary Education: Action through Nutrition and Physical\n\nHealth\n\n  Although physical activity is proves to academically benefit\n\nstudents, good nutrition has also been linked to an improvement in math and\n\nreading scores as well as overall behavior. For this reason it is unfortunate\n\nthat 80 percent of children do not obtain the proper amount of fruits and\n\nvegetables or breakfast before school ( School Breakfast Program, para. 4). A\n\nSchool Breakfast Program began in 1966 and was finalized in 1975 to provide \"\n\nfederally assisted meal program operating in public and nonprofit private\n\nschools and residential child care institutions\" with the intention of\n\nincreasing the amount of students who consumed breakfast in the morning (\n\nSchool Breakfast Program, para. 1).\n\n  After ten years of this program 's existence, observations were\n\nmade regarding any correlation between breakfast consumption and improved\n\ntest scores.\n From 1992-1993, only half of the nation 's elementary school ate\n\nbreakfast; whereas, from 1998-1999 more than three quarters of the students\n\nin elementary school ate prior to school.\n Not only were math and reading scores improved during this time, but\n\nalso anxiety and stress levels were lowered ( Fox and Cole, 2004, pg. 9).\n A study was conducted by observing nineteen students, between age six\n\nand seven, who had to eat breakfast every day consistently for one month.\n It was found that a couple hours after the students consumed a full\n\nmeal in the morning, their \" performance on the tests of memory and the\n\nability to sustain attention were better, fewer signs of frustration were\n\ndisplayed and initially more time was spent on task when working individually\n\nin class\" ( Benton, 2007, pg. 720).\n These positive behaviors show how proper nutrition can, indeed, assist\n\nacademic progress.\n Thus, elementary school should focus their attention on students'\n\nnutrition to yield high scores in various subjects.\n Both the nutritional discrepancies\u00d1from a lack of fruits, vegetables,\n\nand going without breakfast\u00d1impair students' academic excellence, which\n\nexplains why students who eat breakfast overall have significant higher\n\nscores than others ( Ehrlich, 2008, slide 7). \n\n  Many elementary schools who are financially restricted cannot\n\nmake changes in their curriculum to better student 's nutritional and physical\n\nhealth, which forces them to prioritize their educational goals.\n A school 's mission statement first and foremost emphasizes the\n\nimportance of students' academic achievement and promotes empowered learners\n\nto continuously challenge themselves.\n Additionally, schools would like to achieve the aforementioned goals\n\nin a respectful environment to create well-behaved and healthy US citizens\n\nwith strong relationships.\n Although schools recognize the importance of encouraging good health,\n\nfor example, it is not their primary goal as educational institutions.\n Nutritional and physical health are often cut when prioritizing core\n\nclasses if the school has limited funding.\n However, these schools often do not incorporate important everyday\n\nhabits that could be easily attainable without spending a cent.\n Some examples of this could include choosing reading materials\n\nrelated to health or incorporating nutritional facts in science lessons.\n\n  Part of the problem is that limited action can be taken to ensure\n\ngood health in school due to the No Child Left Behind Act ( NCLB).\n This act is used to assess whether schools are successful or not,\n\nevaluate a school 's ability to make effective changes, and measure students'\n\nachievements through standardized tests.\n NCLB has caused public schools to narrow their focus on testing in\n\norder to have a 100 percent student-passing rate ( Illinois State Board of\n\nEducation, para. 1).\n When schools meet the expectation of having each student pass, the\n\ngovernment deems them successful and provides them significantly more funding\n\nthan to other failing schools ( Illinois State Board of Education, para. 6).\n Although this act has great intentions, it is implemented poorly and\n\ntherefore it negatively affects students' health. \n\n  Because of the No Child Left Behind Act, many physical and\n\nnutritional health classes are removed from the school curriculum.\n Additionally, there is a reduction in the instructional time of\n\nPhysical Education classes ( Noffsinger, 2005, para. 3).\n These changes are made because schools feel pressured to allocate\n\nmore of their money to academic classes in order to maintain their \" passing\n\nschool\" status and keep the standards high for students. Without maintaining\n\nthat status, their funding will be even more limited and harmful to the\n\nschool 's future success.\n Rather than dramatically changing the curriculum to yield more\n\nacademic excelling results, often there is a decline academically. \n\n  One experiment that depicts the harm threatened above was\n\nconducted at the Salk Institute in California where two groups of mice where\n\nobserved.\n Mice were used in place of humans for obvious ethical purposes.\n One group was inactive and the other ran a few miles each day.\n As we can see from this experiment, the brain of the active mice\n\ndisplayed more growth, especially in the hippocampus.\n The hippocampus, \" [ the] brain region associated with learning and\n\nmemory, was twice as large\" as compared with the inactive mice ( Dewar, 2008,\n\npara. 3).\n After using these results to relate to overweight children in\n\nAmerica, it was discovered \" that overweight kids found that 40 minutes a day\n\nof aerobic exercise \u00c9 helps us pay attention, plan, and resist distractions\"\n\n( Dewar, 2008, para. 14).\n When gym classes are cut and students are not given a period to run\n\naround and let off energy, students' ability to retain a long attention and\n\nmemory span are impaired.\n Schools are so interested in shifting their focus to academic\n\nclasses, that they not only end up harming their students' health but also\n\ntheir academic success.\n For this reason, cutting gym and other wellness classes can be an\n\nunnecessary evil. \n\n  The biggest problem is that many parents expect schools to take\n\nfull responsibility for their child 's nutrition and physical health.\n Schools do encourage students to get more involved with sports and\n\nexercise, but it is not enough.\n The school 's ability to maintain healthy students is a goal in\n\naddition to other academic ones.\n When kids go home and eat meals lacking in nutrition from their\n\nparents, it defeats all the efforts that the schools put in.\n These empty calories, provided by parents, do not combat nor help the\n\nchildhood obesity problem.\n If parents took more responsibility for their children 's\n\nextracurricular activities and healthy eating habits, then schools would not\n\nface this dilemma of cutting classes, and this would help to alleviate the\n\nfunding crisis schools face today.\n\n  There are many ways that parents can encourage healthy living and\n\neating at home.\n Parents should advocate healthy dieting at home, specifically during\n\nmeals.\n At home, it is common to have the television on during dinner.\n It is a bad habit to keep the TV during meals, however, because \"\n\npeople are less likely to overeat if the TV is off and the family is focused\n\non family time\" ( Hellmich, 2006, pg. 08d).\n Therefore, TVs that are on throughout dinner harm children 's health\n\nbecause they are often unaware of how much they consume and are not paying\n\nattention to their body 's signs of satiety.\n As a response, it is important to make dinner a TV-less environment\n\nwhere the family can focus on their relationships and protect their\n\nchildren 's overall health. \n\n  Parents should also get children involved with exercising or\n\ninvolved with a team sport.\n Televisions, once again, impair this practice as it has been observed\n\nthat, \" decreasing the time they are allowed to watch TV or use the computer\n\nwill increase their physical activity\" ( Hellmich, 2006, pg. 08d).\n Often parents struggle to reduce TV use among children once they have\n\nalready become accustomed to watching it several hours a day.\n In order to get children to want to be active over watching TV,\n\nparents can \" build physical activity into a child 's day by doing things like\n\nwalking to school with [ their] child - - in neighborhoods that are safe and\n\nfree of traffic congestion.\n [ Or they can] ask [ their] children what they want to do that 's fun\"\n\n( Hellmich, 2006, pg. 08d).\n These suggestions are ways that parents could help their children\n\nwithout the school 's help.\n This is because it is both the school and parent 's responsibility to\n\nimprove students' health, which ultimately could prevent the difficult,\n\nlife-long condition of obesity. \n\n  Another way that parents can help is by becoming more consistent\n\nto their requests of their children.\n It has been found that kids often imitate parents' actions as long as\n\nthe parents are consistent with their own demand.\n Similarly, children do not follow directions if the parents request\n\nsomething without acting upon it themselves.\n It is imperative for parents, in addition to schools, to provide the\n\nknowledge, skill, and attitude for food choice for children in order to make\n\ngood choices and live healthy lifestyles.\n Seeing as 2 percent of school-age kids do not consume the recommended\n\ndaily intake from the five major food groups, it is especially important for\n\nparents to encourage better nutrition consumption for their children and for\n\nthemselves ( Forgac, 1999, pg. 49).\n\n  The New York Times covered a study relating to this debate that\n\nanalyzed whether or not vending machines and their unhealthy contents\n\ncontributed to the overarching obesity issue that is present among grade\n\nschool students.\n The Center of Disease Control and Prevention conducted an interesting\n\nstudy from 1999- 2006 on the removal of vending machines in several\n\nelementary schools in Arkansas.\n This study concluded that over four years the average BMI rates of\n\nstudents remained steady despite the removal of unhealthy snacks ( Carroll,\n\n2006, para. 9).\n This article shows that the presence of vending machine in schools do\n\nnot inhibit students' health or contribute to the obesity epidemic among US\n\nchildren today. \n\n  Although this study does not show a direct cause of obesity, by\n\nhaving children select from high-calorie and high-fat food they are at higher\n\nrisk for other health risks, such as high blood pressure.\n It is important for schools to remove or completely revamp vending\n\nmachines to indirectly make children healthier.\n Even though schools often need the funding that popular, brand name\n\nproducts provide, the school should invest in healthier snacks and sign\n\ncontracts with them.\n Although for schools severing contracts will initially create a tight\n\nbudget, it allows new contracts to be signed with healthier companies that\n\nwill over time offer the same benefits of the unhealthy companies, in\n\naddition to advancing student academic achievement. \n\n  It is primarily difficult to develop a wellness program in a\n\ngrade school struggling to get funded by the state government.\n This struggle is due to the pressure of meeting NCLB 's Adequate\n\nYearly Progress requirements.\n As a result, schools often have to focus on academic classes and\n\nteach students towards various high-stake tests.\n However, minor changes can always be made to reinforce good health\n\nhabits.\n When a school is pressured to cut physical and nutritional health,\n\nthe school needs parental support and cooperation to help reinforce these\n\nhealthy lifestyles.\n School boards spend a lot of their time discussing where they should\n\ninvest their limited money, and overall schools prefer to buy new books and\n\nfund new programs than purchase slightly healthier snacks.\n Instead of having educational programs sponsored by fast-food\n\nrestaurants, like McDonald 's, the community libraries or bowling allies could\n\nsponsor them to increase their budget. \n\n  As educators, we could personally influence elementary students\n\nand impact their lifestyles.\n We need to implement and enforce laws that currently exist and add\n\ninformational classes about the importance of nutritional and physical health\n\ninto our schools' curriculums.\n It cannot be assumed that children will understand why we have health\n\nclass; rather, the benefits that their choice will have in the future must be\n\nexplicitly explained to them.\n By emphasizing the importance of nutrition and physical activity, we\n\nwill see improvement in academic performance.\n Our efforts may in turn not only affect our school, but also all\n\nschools in the district.\n This passion can easily spread throughout the nation and finally put\n\nan end to the national obesity issue that exists in the United States of\n\nAmerica.  6", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "46f23a45-d7f0-4902-a20e-ed353d391b72", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.775557+00:00"}

Sister LaTicia Wallace - - to climb up\n\nthere.\n So we had to settle for the pump in the cornfield.\n But I'll never forget it.\n<I 'llUSA:#48:1> I'll always have a soft s 'll for oil derricks. \n\n  We were clear across town visiting Gary 's mom and dad when we\n\nheard about the fire.\n We rushed back home, fast as we could, but when we got there the fire\n\ndepartment had already put it out and there wasn't much left of it but a big\n\nwet pile of stinking, steaming wood.\n The smell of smoke and ruin was in everything, you couldn't miss the\n\nfinality of it all.\n We moved into a trailer on Gary 's parents' lot and waited for the new\n\nhouse to be built, brand spanking new and owned free and clear thanks to the\n\nglories of a healthy insurance policy.\n Insurance is the one thing Gary and I have always seemed to agree on.\n I may get a couple of months behind on my utilities, dodging the\n\nshutoff notices and recorded messages and all, but my insurance premiums are\n\nalways paid on time.\n That 's because Gary lost a house once before.\n Which means an accident here could stir up a lot of trouble and\n\nquestions from the insurance companies, what with two fires in less than a\n\nyear and another one only a few years before that.\n Especially since the insurance was in my name on our last place and\n\nit 's the same here.\n They'd start screamin 'darson so fast, whether they had any evidence\n\nor not, which they wouldn't.\n\n\n  So anyway, the news finally comes on and the anchor is describing\n\nthis guy and asking for anyone with any information regarding the robber to\n\ncall the station to let them know, and then they go to a commercial.\n For a second I get this scared feeling and look towards the bedroom,\n\nbut I put it out of my mind soon enough because I doubt they'll get any\n\ncall 'll\n I don't see too many of us rushing out to inconvenience ourselves\n\nover some small time crime that will get us little more than a court\n\nappearance.\n Traverse may not be a really big city, yet, but it 's definitely a\n\nplace where people are smart enough to know that it 's better to wait for \"\n\nMissing/Reward\" or \" America 's Most Wanted\", or one of those shows, because\n\nat least then you know you're going to get 'reething out of the deal.\n I watch them both; I'm waiting for a cr 'me that I know something\n\nabout, but I suppose the chances of that are pretty darn slim.\n Basically, the community ethic/goodwill thing just doesn't cut it\n\nanymore.\n\n\n  I had an uncle, Uncle Ryan, who got killed doing the good deed\n\nactivity.\n Uncle Ryan was a traveling salesman.\n Bathroom fixtures.\n He was twisting his way through the mountains of southeastern\n\nKentucky when he got killed.\n There are these signs down there, all throughout the mountains that\n\nsay \" Fallen Rock Zone.\u001d\n They used to have signs that said \" Watch For Falling Rocks\", except\n\nyou never see any rocks actually falling, and people were spending more time\n\nlooking for the damn things to fall than they were looking at the road.\n I guess that 's why they made the change.\n Anyway, Uncle Ryan actually saw a rock in the road.\n Now, just because people don't actually see the rocks fall doesn't\n\nmean that they don't.\n There are rocks the size of Yugos and all sorts of smaller boulders\n\nall along the sides of the roads.\n It 's just that you don't see these things _in_ the road.\n Well, Uncle Ryan sees this rock and his first inclination is that\n\nsomeone is going to get hurt with that rock being in the other lane like that\n\nand there being a blind curve right there and no real way for oncoming\n\ntraffic to see the rock, so Uncle Ryan pulls his car off to the side of the\n\nroad as far as he can and he gets out.\n He walks over, bends down, grabs hold of the rock and starts to lift\n\nit.\n He had enough time to get halfway up with it when a huge coal hauler\n\ncame hurtling around that blind curve Uncle Ryan was so concerned about and\n\nhit him dead center on the grill.\n Four days later we had a closed casket ceremony and to this day I'm\n\nconvinced 'mat it simply doesn't pay to go out of your way to help someone\n\nelse if there 's nothing in it for you.\n That may be a hard thing to say, but I tend to think that these are\n\nhard times. \n\n  I'm waiting till 'mfter the news to wake Gary up.\n He 's sleeping in the other room.\n I should wake him up and make him watch the news with me, see what he\n\nsays, but I need time to think.\n And he needs his rest, though how he can sleep I'll never k 'll.\n He picked up a quarter pound of weed from my brother-in-law who lives\n\njust down the road on the street behind ours.\n The dope 's mainly to sell, of course, but we usually skim off half an\n\nounce or so.\n Once it 's all divided up, no one notices.\n Still, I have to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't take too\n\nmuch.\n I have to keep reminding him that it 's an investment.\n You have to be responsible where investments are concerned.\n Sometimes I think love is a lot like baby-sitting.\n But that 's okay.\n Love should be a burden.\n I've alw 've thought that, at least for as long as I've fel 've know\n\nwhat love is. \n\n  My mom knew real love.\n Love was never easy for her.\n I mean, maybe at one time it was, but not that I can remember.\n My dad had Multiple Sclerosis, and it was hard on mother the last\n\nfew years of his life.\n He had gone virtually blind and was in a wheelchair; he used to say\n\nover and over, \" I ain't a baby, I can do it.\u001d\n He said it about everything we tried to do for him, but, of course,\n\nhe couldn't.\n He'd we 'd himself out trying, and then sit there quiet with his eyes\n\nall wet looking while Mom or one of us kids helped him out.\n He had been a policeman and had always been active.\n The MS didn't really start affecting him till he was in his early\n\nthirties.\n My brother and sister and I were all very young.\n By the time I was ten or eleven, it seemed like he had always been\n\nin that wheelchair.\n His speech got to be real difficult to understand as well.\n He'd ge 'dupset over it.\n I can't blame him, now.\n I hate having to repeat myself, and my speech is perfectly clear.\n Mom had to take care of him like he was a child.\n And with three little kids running around on top of it all, it was\n\nhard on her.\n That 's how I know what love is all about, how it has to be a burden\n\nto be real. \n\n  When I first met Gary I was working at a country bar called The\n\nRoundup, a little north of Thompsonville.\n He was up fishing along the Platte River and had been driving around\n\nlooking for a place to get a steak and have a few beers.\n The Roundup is about the most perfect place around for that sort of\n\nthing.\n Anyway, I was serving him, and I guess I must have been pretty\n\nobvious, bending over and letting him have a peek or two at the goods, and\n\nother tricks I still haven't been able to stop using since I did a little\n\ntime as a prostitute.\n Down in Detroit.\n I left that all behind.\n It 's been practically fifteen years now since I got out of that\n\nlife. \n\n  It 's weird when I think back on it.\n It hurts, too.\n Sometimes I want to cry over it, like a black secret I'm 'mlways\n\ntrying to hide from the rest of the world.\n I didn't do it for long, but it was too long just the same.\n I don't even know how it happened.\n I mean, I do, but I have a hard time believing I ever did it.\n I was in the Navy.\n I had a good job working as a missile mechanic, which I also can't\n\nbelieve I ever did.\n I only joined to get my GED and because I couldn't find a job.\n Anyway, one night I went out with a guy I met at a bar and we got to\n\npartying.\n I was gone the whole weekend, went AWOL, and I was afraid to go\n\nback.\n I couldn't call home.\n I needed money and it seemed like an easy enough way of getting\n\nsome.\n Next thing I knew I was dishonorably discharged and sitting on a bus\n\nback to Michigan.\n I went right back to it in Detroit.\n I got into all sorts of other bad things, too, including smack.\n As far as I know there 's still an outstanding warrant for my arrest\n\nthere.\n For loitering of all things.\n That 's what they bust you for when they can't get you on anything\n\nelse.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "44e4f0aa-e2a3-4ab1-97d1-1d2658efd57f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.776850+00:00"}
{"text": "<P>  Two major forces have shaped the current drive to implement format\n\nintegration.\n First, usage of USMARC as the basis of library catalogs has become\n\ncommon for all library types throughout the country; very few libraries rely\n\nsolely on card access to their collections anymore.\n With the growth of automated systems, vendors and librarians alike\n\nhave been interested in better standardization of these formats.\n Secondly, as our culture continues its evolution from a primarily\n\npaper-based environment to one where multimedia plays an increasing role, the\n\nnature of published materials has changed dramatically.\n Publishers market monographs with accompanying material ranging\n\nanywhere from computer diskettes to kazoos.\n Multimedia works often encompass several different material types such\n\nas CD-ROMs, printed guides and computer files.\n These changes have presented an ongoing challenge to catalogers and\n\nsystem librarians.\n How can we best describe these multi-faceted items and ensure their\n\nretrieval in automated systems?\n\n<P>  Discussion about unifying the seven separate USMARC bibliographic\n\nformats began in 1983.\n Format integration was envisioned as a means to simplify\n\ndocumentation, reduce redundancy across formats, enable catalogers to work\n\nmore easily with multiple formats, and improve machine validation of MARC\n\nrecords.\n Although the need for format integration was identified over a decade\n\nago, its implementation has been slow.\n The need for compatibility in sharing data among the Library of\n\nCongress, the bibliographic utilities and various local systems has been the\n\nbiggest challenge with format integration and has contributed to the delays\n\nin its implementation.\n\n<P>  The phrase \" format integration\" applies to changes in the USMARC\n\nbibliographic formats only.\n Other MARC formats, such as authorities, holdings, classification and\n\ncommunity information remain unaffected.\n It encompasses coordination across forms of material, removing the\n\nrestriction on data elements that have previously made them valid only for\n\nspecific forms of material.\n In spite of the efforts involved in the implementation of format\n\nintegration, the bulk of the alterations in USMARC will affect just a small\n\npercentage of cataloging records.\n\n\n<P>  The first portion of format integration came in 1991, with USMARC\n\nUpdate No.\n 3.\n This update included a few changes that primarily involved the\n\nimplementation of blank indicator values.\n The rest of format integration was originally planned to be\n\nimplemented simultaneously.\n However, as the planning for implementation progressed, it became\n\nclear that the changes to the variable fields had a much smaller impact on\n\nsystems which handle MARC records than the fixed field changes.\n Due to the difficulty of implementing the latter, MARBI accepted a\n\nproposal in 1993 to split the remainder of format integration into two\n\nphases, variable fields and fixed fields.\n This compromise allowed the variable field portion to be implemented\n\nsooner, instead of postponing the entire project until the fixed field\n\nportion could be ready.\n The variable field phase of format integration was implemented in\n\nlate January of 1995.\n\n<P>  This phase essentially validated all variable fields across all\n\nformats, while eliminating some obsolete fields.\n This article focuses on the final phase of format integration, which\n\naffects the Leader and 001-008 fixed fields.\n The Library of Congress and the bibliographic utilities have\n\nscheduled the implementation of this phase for March 3, 1996.\n There are several changes that will impact catalogers and systems in\n\nthe final phase.\n * Changes to the Leader/06 ( Type of record) Remove: b = archival and\n\nmanuscripts control add: p = mixed material t = manuscript language material\n\n* Definition of Leader/08 ( Type of control) blank = no specified type of\n\ncontrol a = archival control\n\n<P>  The changes to the Leader/06 ( Type of record) and the definition\n\nof Leader/08 ( Type of control) will have a significant impact on the coding\n\nof archival materials.\n These modifications recognize that archival control is not limited to\n\na particular type of material.\n With the final phase of format integration, archivists will be able\n\nto better distinguish between various material types, such as monograph vs.\n serial, and also will not be limited to choosing archival control\n\nover the visual materials format when describing an archival film, for\n\nexample.\n This structural change in the MARC record necessitates some\n\nalterations in how the bibliographic utilities will handle archival records.\n OCLC will eliminate the Archival and Manuscript Control format ( AMC)\n\nand will introduce a new format, Mixed Materials, to accommodate records for\n\nwhich no single other format predominates.\n In RLIN, the AMC file will remain, intended for use with archival\n\ncollections of mixed materials or any individual material type.\n The RLIN-specific archival control segment ( ARC), previously valid\n\nonly in the AMC and visual materials files, will be made available for use in\n\nall formats when the material represented by the bibliographic record is\n\nunder archival control.\n\n<P>  * Validate values for 007 ( Physical Description Fixed Field)\n\nacross all formats\n\n<P>  The extension of field 007 to all formats enables specific\n\nencoding of all the physical aspects present in the item in hand.\n The field may be repeated when different parts of the item have\n\ndifferent characteristics, such as a positive and a negative polarity\n\nmicrofilm cataloged on the same record, or to represent the secondary nature\n\nwith mixed material.\n\n<P>  * Changes to 008/byte 06 ( Date entered on file) Redefine\n\ndetailed date from \" d\" to \" e\" in all formats Remove actual date and\n\ncopyright date ( \" c\" in most formats) Define publication date and copyright\n\ndate \" t\" for all formats Validate other values across all formats,\n\nincluding: \" c\" - serial item currently published \" d\" - serial item ceased\n\npublication\n\n<P>  * Changes to 008/bytes 07-14 ( Date 1/Date 2) \" u\" - Date element\n\nis totally or partially unknown \" blank\" - Date element is not applicable\n\nWith the final phase of format integration, the first 17 bytes of field 008,\n\nplus the final five, will have consistent definitions across all formats,\n\nwhile bytes 18-34 will remain format specific.\n The changes inherent in this process will introduce non-serial\n\ncatalogers to some serial date codes, just as variable field format\n\nintegration introduced tag 246 across all formats.\n The biggest change in field 008 is the shift from using \" c\" to \" t\"\n\nto indicate copyright date.\n Another change which will arise with some frequency is the ability to\n\ncode unknown dates with \" u\" instead of the current practice of using zeros\n\nto complete unknown dates.\n\n<P>  * Redefine 006 field ( Fixed-Length Data Element - Additional\n\nMaterial Characteristics)\n\n<P>  Full implementation of format integration will finally enable\n\ncatalogers to describe material with characteristics which are representative\n\nof more than one MARC bibliographic format.\n In the current cataloging environment, once the decision is made\n\nabout the primary nature of the material, certain aspects of the secondary\n\nnature are lost in the description.\n Examples of such mixed materials include: a book with an accompanying\n\nsound recording, or a serially issued score.\n Even though format integration of the variable fields addresses the\n\nspecific description problems with these mixed materials, without the\n\naccompanying fixed fields, machine manipulation of all aspects of the\n\ncataloging record is limited to the primary material type described in field\n\n008.\n The redefinition of field 006 will change all that.\n The 006 parallels the material-specific bytes of field 008, allowing\n\nthe representation of all aspects of an item for subsequent machine\n\nmanipulation, even that pesky serially published map on CD-ROM.\n Field 006 will be used only for those materials which encompass more\n\nthan one material type.\n It has a leading character which identifies the secondary nature of\n\nthe material, that is book, serial, score, recording, etc.\n For a summary of the 006 field, see the chart below.\n The leading character in field 006 will determine what the valid\n\ncodes are for the secondary nature.\n The remainder of the 006 bytes match those of the 008 for a\n\nparticular material type, in the same fashion currently that the 007 leading\n\nbyte defines the following values.\n The tables reproduced at the end of this article summarize the\n\ndefinitions of the 006 field for books, music, and serials, with the codes\n\nused by OCLC, RLIN and WLN in the equivalent 008 fields at this time.\n\n<P>  It is unclear whether or not the following paragraph, which\n\nis encapsulated by quotation marks, is in fact a quote with a source of\n\norigin distinct from the author.\n It has been included here for lack of evidence against my assumption,\n\nwhich is that the quotation marks here are not being used to indicate a\n\nquote\"Field 006 will have no indicators or subfield codes.\n The field will have a generic-tree structure, whereby the category of\n\nmaterial code given in 006/00 ( Type of 006 code) will determine the data\n\nelements defined for subsequent character positions.\n For each category of material, the codes defined for character\n\npositions 01-17 will be the same as those defined for that category in field\n\n008 ( Fixed-Length Data Elements), character positions 18-34.\" - USMARC\n\n<P>  When encountering material that exhibits multiple material type\n\ncharacteristics, a question remains about how to select the primary aspect.\n USMARC sets forth a model, reproduced below, to assist with the\n\ndecision-making.\n In spite of this model, interpretation about whether or not an item\n\nis basically textual will still rest with cataloger judgment.\n Note that the selection of the primary characteristic determines the\n\nappropriate chapter of AACR2r to be used as the basis for the description.\n Thus, in shared databases, the description may vary somewhat\n\ndepending on which characteristic is chosen as the primary one.\n\n<P>  The material below has been maintained formatting seems to be\n\nintact.\n\n\n<P>  The impact that full format integration will have on our\n\ncataloging databases depends on several factors.\n As with variable field format integration, some changes to existing\n\nrecords will be able to be made by a simple machine substitution; however,\n\nother changes will have to be made manually.\n It seems unlikely that libraries will go back and recatalog items\n\nwith multiple characteristics, or that the utilities will add field 006 to\n\nexisting records in their databases.\n In fact, it is difficult to identify older records that might benefit\n\nfrom the addition of field 006.\n It is important to remember that these older records are not \"\n\nincorrect.\" Instead they will not reflect the full content designation\n\navailable with the format integrated version of USMARC.\n Additionally, field 006 is optional; thus usage of this field will\n\nvary among institutions according to their perceived needs, the national\n\nlibraries' practices, and the nature of the material being cataloged.\n The five cataloging examples included at the end of this article\n\ndemonstrate some of the changes with this phase of format integration.\n At this point, it is difficult to determine exactly how the various\n\nutilities and local systems will handle the upcoming changes with the final\n\nphase of format integration.\n Decision points include: indexing field 006 for retrieval;\n\nidentifying cataloging records by material type when more than one type is\n\nrepresented; implementing new MARC screen designs which will not fill the\n\nfirst page of the cataloging record with fixed field options and modifying\n\nvalidation routines which take the new options into account.\n The bibliographic utilities and system vendors have started\n\nannouncing some of their planned changes via their web sites ( see\n\nhttp://www-rlg.stanford.edu/welcome.html,\n\nhttp://www.oclc.org/oclc/menu/home1.htm, and the Library Vendors section at\n\nhttp://lcweb.loc.gov/global/library/library.html#vendors).\n How the systems and utilities choose to index field 006 for retrieval\n\nwill be based on their pre-existing file structures.\n Depending on the programming, these decisions may have a significant\n\nimpact on record retrieval when a user qualifies by material type.\n If the material-specific bytes of fields 008 and 006 cannot be\n\nsearched concurrently, multiple searches of a given database may be needed to\n\nretrieve all relevant records.\n The display of search results may also be dependent on the coding of\n\nthe primary material characteristic.\n As the March 1996 implementation date draws closer, the utilities and\n\nvendors will make more specific information available about how the final\n\nphase of format integration affects searching in their systems.\n\n<P>  The utilities' implementation of this phase of format integration\n\nwill cause some changes in the familiar screen displays.\n In OCLC, look for new standardized labels and layout of the fixed\n\nfields across all formats.\n Field 006 will display as a variable field, although users will be\n\nable to enter and edit this tag either directly, or as a prompted display\n\nwith mnemonics.\n RLIN will automatically generate templates for field 007 based on the\n\nfile type.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "61f0dd89-00d1-4dcd-97f7-a4593049fe8f", "added":

{"text": "This paper is concerned with Aristotle 's account of primary\n\nsubstances ( ousiai) as presented in the Categories.\n It is argued that one of his criteria for primary substances--the\n\nexistential criterion--impales Aristotle on the horns of a dilemma: either\n\nAristotle must admit substantial kinds as primary substances or he must\n\ncountenance the existence of bare particulars.\n However, the former alternative contradicts Aristotle 's remarks\n\nconcerning the nature of primary substances.\n While, the latter alternative cannot be squared with the ontology\n\nfound in the Categories.\n It is my belief that it was his awareness of these problems that lead\n\nAristotle to drop the ontology of the Categories and develop the more complex\n\nontology of the Metaphysics.\n\n  In order to supply a perspicuous rendering of the dilemma, it is\n\nnecessary to first outline the basics of Aristotle 's ontology in the\n\nCategories, and then to closely examine his criteria for primary substances.\n Only then can we proceed to a detailed examination of the dilemma.\n\n\n 1.\n\n\n\n  Two entities found in the ontology of the Categories are ( a)\n\nindividuals or particulars and ( b) properties.\n Examples of particulars are \" a man,\" \" the individual man,\" \" an\n\nanimal,\" \" the individual horse,\" \" a picture,\" and \" an ox.?\n Whereas examples of properties are \" four-foot,\" \" grammatical,\" \"\n\nhas armour on,\" \" white,\" and the relational properties, \" double,\" \" half,\"\n\nand \" in\" ( for example, in the market place and in the Lyceum). \n\n  It appears to be a clear and uncontroversial point within\n\nAristotelian scholarship, and one that I am in agreement with, that Aristotle\n\nholds some version of a substance-attribute theory of particulars ( as\n\nopposed to a bundle theory of particulars).\n It is also clear that so far as properties are concerned, Aristotle\n\nis a realist, as opposed to a nominalist.\n That is, he allows that there really are such things in the world as\n\nproperties and relations.\n What is less clear is whether he holds properties to be universals or\n\ntropes ( understood as property instances).\n I side with the view that Aristotle takes properties to be\n\nuniversals.[1]\n However, this issue, while of intrinsic interest, is of minimal\n\nimportance to my thesis, because the soundness of my argument that Aristotle\n\nis faced with a dilemma is independent of the question of whether or not\n\nAristotle holds properties to be tropes or universals.\n Therefore, I will attempt to employ the neutral term \" property\"\n\nrather than \" universal\" or \" trope.\" \n\n  The next step is to determine whether properties are immanent or\n\ntranscendent.\n To claim that properties are immanent is to assert that they exist\n\nwholly in space and time--that the world, which includes properties, isa\n\nsingle spatio-temporal manifold.\n ( Such a view is compatible with naturalism.) Immanent properties\n\nmust be instantiated ( in a particular)--there can be no uninstantiated\n\nproperties.\n It follows that the property x exists if and only if x is\n\ninstantiated in a particular.\n This position may be contrasted with a transcendent theory of\n\nuniversals, as attributed to Plato 's middle dialogues.\n A transcendent theory of properties allows properties to exist\n\nindependently of their instantiation in any particular.\n Thus the property x may exist even if there are no particulars that\n\ninstantiate that property.\n\n\n  There is little doubt that Aristotle wished to contrast his\n\ntheory of properties with that propounded by Plato.\n And it seems farily clear, while not absolutely certain, that, in the\n\nCategories this contrast leads us to conclude that Aristotle accepts an\n\nimmanent theory of properties.[2] \n\n\n  We now move deeper into Aristotle 's ontology and examine the\n\nnature of the relation between particulars and properties.\n That is, we examine his theory of predication.\n For Aristotle there are two forms of metaphysical predication: a.\n the said-of relation b.\n\n\n  This amounts two metaphysically distinct manners in which\n\nproperties are able to be predicated of subjects.\n For example, both the property of man and the property of pallor may\n\nbe predicated of Socrates.\n Yet, each quality bears a distinct type of relation to the subject\n\nSocrates.\n Man is predicated of Socrates by the said-of relation while pallor is\n\npredicated of Socrates by the present-in relation.\n These two relations combine in four possible ways, yeilding four\n\ntypes of metaphysical entities.[3] \n\n  a.\n Substantial individuals.\n Substantial individuals are neither present-in nor said-of anything.\n Examples are Socrates, the individual man, Phar Lap, and the\n\nindividual horse.\n A substantial individual, such as Socrates, is not predicated, by\n\neither the present-in or the said-of relation, of any subject.\n\n\n  b.\n Substantial kinds.\n Substantial kinds are said-of something, but are not present-in\n\nanything.\n Examples are species and genera; such as man, horse, and animal.\n A substantial kind, such as horse, is predicated by the said-of\n\nrelation of a subject, such as Phar Lap, but is not predicated by the\n\npresent-in relation of any subject. \n\n  c.\n Non-substantial individuals.\n Non-substantial individuals are present-in something, but not said-of\n\nanything.\n Examples are midnight black and pallor.\n A non-substantial individual, such as the shade of color midnight\n\nblack, may be predicated by the present-in relation of a subject, such as\n\nPhar Lap, yet it is not predicated by the said-of relation of any subject.\n\n\n\n  d.\n Non-substantial kinds.\n Non-substantial kinds are both present-in and said-of something.\n Examples are color.\n A non-substantial kind, such as color, is predicated by the said-of\n\nrelation of midnight black, and is also predicated by the present-in relation\n\nof Phar Lap ( in virtue of the fact that Phar Lap is midnight black). \n\n  It should be noted that the notions of substance and\n\nnon-substance, and both the present-in and said-of relations are undefined in\n\nthe Categories.\n Lewis points out that the notions of substance and non-substance are\n\nspecified in terms of the notions of metaphysical predication--in terms of\n\nthe said-of and present-in relations.[4]\n At the same time, the notions of metaphysical predication are\n\nspecified in terms of the distinction between substances and non-substances.\n The result is that neither can be taken as providing a definition of\n\nthe other.\n Rather, Lewis suggests that we take both notions to be primitive in\n\nAristotle. \n 2.\n\n\n  Aristotle declares that of the four types of metaphysical\n\nentities identified above substantial individuals ( such as the individual\n\nman, say, Socrates and the individual horse, say, Phar Lap) are ontologically\n\nbasic and play the role of primary substances.\n Two criteria are employed by Aristotle for delineating the general\n\npatterns of ontological priority and dependency in identifying substantial\n\nindividuals as primary substances.\n\n\n  a.\n Predicative: that which is neither said-of nor present-in a subject,\n\nand that which all other things are predicated of. \n\n  b.\n Existential: that which is such that \" if it were not to exist, it\n\nwould be impossible for anything to exist.\" \n\n  This section examines the arguments by which Aristotle attempts\n\nto use each of these criteria to establish the ontological primacy of primary\n\nsubstances. \n\n\n  The predicative criterion consists of two parts: ( a) that which\n\nis neither said-of nor present-in a subject, and ( b) that which all other\n\nthings are predicated of.\n The first part unequivocally picks out substantial individuals as\n\nprimary substances.\n\n\n  A substance--that which is called a substance most strictly,\n\nprimarily, and most of all--is that which is neither said of a subject nor in\n\na subject, e.g.\n\n\n  This clearly identifies substantial individuals as primary\n\nsubstances, for the criterion for substantial individuals is simply the first\n\npart of the criterion for primary substances.\n So Socrates and Phar Lap, as examples of substantial individuals, are\n\nprimary substances. \n\n  The second part of the predicative criterion states that a\n\nprimary substance is also subject for everything else.\n\n\n  It is because the primary substances are subjects for all the\n\nother things and all the other things are predicated of them or are in them,\n\nthat they are called substances most of all.[6] \n\n \n\n  It is because primary substances are subjects for everything else\n\nthat they are called substances most strictly.[7] \n\n  This amounts to all the other three metaphysical entities\n\nidentified above ( that is, substantial kinds, non-substantial individuals,\n\nand non-substantial kinds) being predicated, by either the said-of or the\n\npresent-in relation, of substantial individuals as primary substances.\n A primary substance is therefore the subject in every instance of\n\npredication. This second part of the predicative criterion for primary\n\nsubstances does not alter the extension of primary substances as determined\n\nby the first part of the criterion.\n In other words, like the first part of the criterion, this second\n\npart also picks out all and only substantial individuals as primary\n\nsubstances.\n Despite the fact that this second part of the predicative criterion\n\ndoes not alter the extension of what are to count as primary substances it\n\nnonetheless has the virtue of identifying a further attribute possessed by\n\nprimary substances. \n\n  The fact that a primary substance is the subject in every\n\ninstance of predication is accounted for by what Lewis terms the \" monolithic\n\ntheory of predication.\"[8] \n\n  An item is predicated of something other than an individual\n\nsubstance only if, and only because, there is some individual substance of\n\nwhich both items together are predicated.[9] \n\n  Aristotle provides a number of examples: Man is predicated of the\n\nindividual man, and animal of man; so animal will be predicated of the\n\nindividual man also--for the individual man is both a man and an animal.[10]\n\n\n\n  And: Animal is predicated of man and therefore of the individual\n\nman; for were it predicated of none of the individual men it would not be\n\npredicated of man at all.[11] \n\n  The predicative criterion succeeds in picking out a class of\n\nentities that are to be considered primary substances, namely substantial\n\nindividuals.\n But does the criterion give us any reason to consider this class of\n\nentities to be ontologically primary?\n As noted, the predicative criterion identifies two attributes of\n\nprimary substances: ( a) they are neither said-of nor present-in a subject,\n\nand ( b) all other things are predicated of them.\n It is hard to imagine how the first part of the criterion could be\n\nseen as providing a quality that gives substantial individuals ontological\n\npriority. In itself, the fact that an entity is not predicated of any other\n\nentity provides little clue as to its relations of ontological dependency on\n\nother entities.\n The second attribute appears more promising.\n This is because, with its assumption of the monolithic theory of\n\npredication, it is closely related to the existential criterion for primary\n\nsubstances ( discussed in the next section) and makes substantial claims\n\nconcerning the relations of ontological priority.  \n 2.2 Existential Criterion\n\n  The existential criterion provides grounds for the ontological\n\npriority of primary substances.\n\n\n  If the primary substances did not exist it would be impossible\n\nfor any of the other things to exist.[12] \n\n  This criterion picks out all substantial individuals as primary\n\nsubstances.\n Given the existential criterion, the monolithic theory of\n\npredication, and an immanent theory of predication, it follows that if\n\nsubstantial individuals were not to exist, then it would be impossible for\n\nanything else to exist. \n\n  The monolithic theory of predication contends that all instances\n\nof predication must involve a substantial individual as subject.\n For example, animal can be predicated of man if and only if both\n\nanimal and man are predicated of an individual man ( which is a substantial\n\nindividual).\n In turn, an immanent theory of properties holds that a property\n\ncannot exist uninstantiated.\n That is, a property cannot exist if it is not predicated of a\n\nsubject.\n And non-substantial individuals, substantial kinds, and\n\nnon-substantial kinds are all properties.\n As a result, they can only exist on the condition that they are\n\ninstantiated in, or predicated of, some subject.\n And, as the monolithic theory of predication points out, this\n\nsubject must be a substantial individual.\n Therefore, it follows that if substantial individuals were not to\n\nexist, then neither would non-substantial individuals, substantial kinds, nor\n\nnon-substantial kinds.\n In other words, if substantial individuals did not exist, then it\n\nwould not be possible for anything else to exist.\n The ontological primacy of individual substances lies in the fact\n\nthat everything else is existentially dependent upon them for existence. \n\n\n 3.\n\n\n  While the existential criterion manages to both pick out all\n\nsubstantial individuals as primary substances, and provides grounds for\n\nconsidering primary substances to be ontological prior, it also manages to\n\nconfuse and muddy Aristotle 's ontology.\n This is because the existential criterion forces Aristotle to admit\n\nthat not only substantial individuals, but also substantial kinds are primary\n\nsubstances.\n And this runs contrary to Aristotle 's intentions and explicitly\n\nstated remarks in the Categories.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "56c6f1ae-a048-4abf-b777-ed1a7518f21f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.779459+00:00"}

How long had it been since my\n\nlast visit to Argentina?\n ( Almost ten years.) Didn't I miss it?\n ( Not really.) How come it had been such a long time?\n ( No particular reason.)

some were taken in for questioning and then\n\nreleased.\n Others were beaten up and killed.\n Sometimes if I close my eyes I can see it all clearly.\n I remember the noise of wood breaking.\n I lay in bed for a few minutes after that.\n Then my mother screams and I jump out of bed and out into the hall.\n Four men in uniform are dragging my father out of bed.\n With a club they hit my father on the back of the legs.\n I see them throw him down on the floor.\n They kick his legs.\n My mother runs out to the hall, she screams, she implores.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Not yet.\n They kick him again and again.\n Then they pull him up and hold him in mid-air - - not quite standing\n\nand with his knees barely touching the floor.\n You're ma 'reg a mistake, my mother screams at them.\n But they don't hear her.\n They hit him on the side of the stomach, then using their hands.\n Up against the wall and bang over the left ear, then bang over the\n\nright ear.\n They shake him and hit him against the wall and hit him on the face\n\nagain. \n\n  And then they stop and drag my father out through the living\n\nroom to the front door.\n\n\n  I remember my mother on the phone talking to a lawyer, to her\n\nfriends, to anyone who might be able to get my father back.\n At night I would lay in bed with her and listen to her crying softly\n\non the pillow.\n For a week it was like that.\n And then one day my father just walked in the door.\n With bruises all over his face and body.\n He was lucky, many others never came back.\n Not long after that my parents got their visas approved to go to\n\nSpain.\n We never came back.\n\n\n  At night I dream that I'm wal 'mng alone down a crowded street.\n I turn in circles over and over again hoping to recognize something.\n On all sides are tall buildings that sparkle and shine with\n\nadvertisements for Coca-Cola, Nike and Marlboro.\n People are walking hurriedly by me, sometimes pushing me aside to\n\nget by.\n I look at all the people rushing past but their faces are not\n\nfamiliar.\n I open my mouth to ask for directions but no one sees me, and it\n\ndoesn't matter because I realize that I have nowhere to go.\n I stand in the corner of a busy intersection for what seems like\n\nhours.\n And I feel like crying.\n Then across the street I see my grandmother and mother.\n They wave to me and signal me to go over to them.\n But the street has nine lanes and the cars are going too fast.\n I wait and wait but the light doesn't change and I can't cross.\n Then from behind me someone grabs my hand and I turn around and it 's\n\nmy father.\n And together we start to cross the street.\n\n\n  The plane 's lights are still dimmed and everyone around me is\n\nstill asleep.\n From the little oval window I can see the first of the sun rays\n\nreach out to me.\n As the sun makes its way up the light blue sky some people around me\n\nstart to wake up and talk in agitated murmurs.\n Then the whole plane is awake and people are excited as they hear\n\nthe pilot 's voice say that in twenty minutes we'l 'lle landing.\n Hundreds of miles below tiny houses and buildings start appearing\n\neverywhere.\n From up here all looks peaceful, quiet.\n The woman next to me, Clara, writes her phone number in a little\n\npiece of paper. \n\n  \" If you want someone to show you around, I 'd be more than happy\n\nto.\n There are so many beautiful places to visit in this city - it 'd be a\n\npity to leave without seeing some of them,\" she says to me.\n\n\n***1900 WORDS ( D.

Vincent Aug Jr.\n Wednesday granted F&C 's request to expedite the sale of the Canadian\n\nbusiness to Kerry Ingredients of Canada, a unit of Kerry Group plc, subject\n\nto creditor objections.\n\n  The base purchase price is\n\n&dollar; 3.4 million but could rise to\n\n&dollar;7.7 million if Kerry buys the subsidiary 's inventory and receivables.\n\n  If none of F&C 's creditors object, the company plans to go ahead\n\nwith the auction in New York City, a move which could draw other bidders.\n\n  Frank Budetti, F&C 's chief executive officer, said the Canadian\n\nbusiness isn't part of F&C 's bankruptcy, so the sale doesn't require Aug 's\n\napproval.\n But court approval will speed the sale, Budetti said, allowing F&C to\n\nrepay some debts and trim about\n\n&dollar; 75,000 in loan fees due Star Bank.\n\n  In a related development, Jon P. Fries, F&C 's fired chairman, has\n\nasked Aug to lift the automatic stay on suits against F&C while it 's in\n\nbankruptcy reorganization so he can renew his suit against F&C in Hamilton\n\nCounty Common Pleas Court.\n\n  F&C, once a hot stock on Wall Street, was forced to seek\n\nBankruptcy reorganization April 19, just two weeks after firing Fries and\n\nDisclosing inventory discrepancies estimated at up to\n\n&dollar; 8 million.\n\n  F&C, also the target of a Securities and Exchange Commission\n\nprobe, filed suit against Fries, claiming he \" directed and acquiesced\" in\n\nthe inventory fraud.\n Fries denied those charges and filed a\n\n&dollar; 7.7 million suit against F&C claiming the company violated his employment\n\nagreement and slandered him.\n\n  That suit was withdrawn because of the automatic stay, D. Jeffrey\n\nIreland, Fries' attorney, said.\n But Ireland said Fries' suit won't jeopardize F&C 's reorganization,\n\nand he thinks that relief from the stay is merited.\n\n\n  Aug has set a hearing on Fries' request for Oct. 5.\n\n\n  Budetti said the proceeds from the sale of the Canadian business\n\nwill reduce F&C 's debt to Star Bank to less than\n\n&dollar; 8 million, down from\n\n&dollar;17.5 million in June.\n\n  Previously, F&C sold its New Jersey fragrance business for\n\n&dollar;4.7 million and its Hong Kong subsidiary for\n\n&dollar; 800,000. \n\n\n Alternative banking: Local bankers scramble to offer new services\n\nand offset growth in non-banking options</H>\n\n  Greater Cincinnati banks are putting more emphasis on offering\n\nnew services and products to a vital part of their customer base:\n\nindividuals.\n\n  With interest rates at their lowest levels in more than 20 years,\n\nyields on traditional saving vehicles such as certificates of deposit ( CDs)\n\nand passbook savings accounts no longer provide retail customers the best\n\nreturn for their money.\n\n  Responding to that trend, depositors have been pouring money\n\nprimarily into stocks, bonds or mutual funds in search of better returns.\n\n  Local banks--particularly the larger ones--are fighting back by\n\noffering customers alternative products and services ranging from telephone\n\nbanking to mutual funds to branch banking in stores.\n\n  Banks are offering alternatives largely because low rates have\n\ncut yields on traditional deposits and are driving away individual customers,\n\nsaid Fritz Elmendorf, a spokesman for the Consumer Bankers Association, an\n\nArlington, Va.-based trade group.\n\n  \" This is something that will not be temporary, but a course for\n\nthose regularly willing to take the risk uninsured products with higher\n\nyields than FDIC-insured banking products, Elmendorf said.\n\n  So have elderly customers, particularly those nearing retirement\n\nand relying on higher-yielding investments as part of their income.\n\n  The shift actually began about two years ago, as interest rates\n\ndropped and consumers sought higher yields.\n\n  According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., investments in\n\nrate-sensitive deposits like CDs at banks totaled\n\n&dollar;845 billion, or 32%, of all deposits as of March, 1993, down from\n%\n&dollar; 970 billion, or 36%, of all deposits as of March, 1992.\n%\n  CD investments have plunged with their rates: By the end of 1992,\n\none-year CDs were paying less an 3%, with 2-1/2-year CDs at about 3.5% and\n%\nfive-year CDs at 4.75%, a recent %ank Rate Monitor survey showe%.\n That compares with rates of 7% or more just two years ago.\n In contrast, the amount of money in stock, bond and money market\n\nfunds; grew to an all-time high of\n\n&dollar; 1.847 trillion as of July, 1993, up 20% from\n\n&dollar; 1.539 trillion i% July, 1992, and 50% from\n\n&dollar;1.227 tril%ion in July, 1991.\n The growth made those products some of the nation 's biggest\n\ncollectors of money after bank and insurance companies, Investment Company\n\nInstitute, a Washington-based trade group, said.\n\n  Sales of stock and bond funds alone accounted for much of the\n\ngrowth, rising 33% during the first se%en months of 1993 to\n\n&dollar; 156.5 billion from\n\n&dollar; 117.3 billion at the end of 1992, the institute said.\n\n  Banks across the nation have responded with efforts to build-or\n\nrebuild--their retail banking business.\n\n  Among the actions banks are taking to keep or draw back\n\ndepositors:\n\n  * Offering alternative investments such as tax-exempt stocks and\n\nbonds, as well as annuities, that offer higher yields.\n\n  * Adding bank branches to such sites as grocery stores to\n\nincrease deposits and loans.\n\n  * Training employees to handle a variety of customers' needs,\n\ninstead of shuffling customers through several departments.\n\n  \" You'll con 'llue to see an accelerated pace of banks acting more\n\nlike retailers,\" Phillip A. Parker, executive vice president at Star Bank,\n\nsaid.\n \" We have to be like Saks or Lazarus and do things to bring people in\n\nthe bank\".\n\n  Working from that philosophy, Greater Cincinnati banks are\n\nImplementing several options to maintain and increase their number of\n\ndepositors.\n\n  Star, for example, has introduced new products such as mutual\n\nfunds, discount brokerage services and annuities to protect its No.\n\n\n  Star also is considering opening its first bank branches in\n\ngrocery stores in Greater Cincinnati, Parker said.\n\n  That strategy has worked well for Star in northern Ohio, where\n\nthe bank has opened five such branches since May.\n The result: Consumers have opened about 1,000 new accounts at those\n\nbranches and poured in\n\n&dollar; 2.5 million worth of deposits, Parker said.\n\n\n  Provident Bank also is eyeing in-store banking, having recently\n\nopened a branch at a Thriftway grocery store in Fairfield, local bank\n\nexecutives said.\n\n  Local bankers are watching Provident 's moves in that arena\n\nclosely, wondering whether the bank will be able boost its No.\n 2 position in the retail banking market by entering more of\n\nThriftway 's 24 local stores.\n Provident and Thriftway aren't talking, however; executives at both\n\nfirms did not return calls seeking comment.\n\n  PNC Bank Ohio/Northern Kentucky is preparing to launch new\n\nproducts, Executive Vice President Dennis P. Brenckle said.\n\n  Among them: The bank is testing ways to add such services as\n\ncheck cashing to its automated teller machine ( ATM) network and recently\n\nupgraded its regional marketing centers in Greater Cincinnati.\n Those centers give customers the option of buying several products at\n\none site.\n\n  \" It 's great to be part of this concept because you have many\n\nmore resources that you can refer customers to,\" Jenea Norris Allen, a\n\nresidential loan officer at PNC 's downtown office, said. \n\n\n\n\n  Fifth Third Bank, the leader in local retail banking, has beefed\n\nup its retail business with an in-home banking option, P.

{"text": "The HyperText Markup Language ( HTML) used by the World-Wide Web\n\nhas limited markup and structure recognition capabilities.\n Only a small set of text characteristics can be represented, and few\n\nof these have any functional value beyond display capabilities.\n The HTML ANCHOR element supports hypertext links; however, it cannot\n\nretrieve components of a linked document, such as a single glossary entry\n\nfrom a collection of several thousand entries, without resorting to programs\n\nexternal to HTML and the Web server.\n In spite of these limitations, HTML and the Web are key technologies\n\nfor libraries.\n\n  The Standard Generalized Markup Language ( SGML) is a full-\n\nfeatured, standard markup language.\n HTML is actually an SGML Document Type Definition.\n Ideally, it would be possible to retrieve text documents marked up\n\nwith the richer SGML tag set via the World-Wide-Web.\n\n  This technical paper discusses how the Web can be linked to the\n\nPAT system, Open Text 's search engine that supports access to SGML-encoded\n\ndocuments.\n This Web-to-PAT Gateway utilizes the Web 's Common Gateway Interface (\n\nCGI) capability and SGML-to-HTML filter programs.\n\n  After briefly overviewing key technical concepts, the paper\n\nexplains the operation of the Web-to-PAT Gateway, using several examples of\n\nhow it is employed at the University of Virginia Libraries, including access\n\nto text files such as a Middle English collection, the Oxford English\n\nDictionary, and the Text Encoding Initiative 's Guidelines for Electronic Text\n\nEncoding and Interchange.\n\n \n\n  This approach to using the Web to provide access to complex\n\ntextual resources involves many tools and concepts that may be unfamiliar to\n\nthe reader.\n This section provides a very brief overview of these complex topics\n\nand it describes their interrelationships.\n\n\n  Standards and open systems must be an essential part of library\n\nefforts to provide large-scale, wide-area access to textual resources.\n Textual resources must be reusable.\n Because of the cost of creating texts, it must be possible to use the\n\ntexts in a variety of settings with a variety of tools.\n To that end, a standards-based encoding scheme must be the foundation\n\nof text creation.\n\n  The Standard Generalized Markup Language ( SGML), an\n\ninternational standard, is such an encoding scheme, and it has proven\n\nextremely valuable in effecting an open systems approach with text. [ 1]\n This paper is not the place to present a detailed argument for using\n\nSGML, especially when this has been done so effectively elsewhere. [ 2]\n However, in addition to its value as an internationally approved\n\nstandard, SGML is ideally suited to supporting text retrieval because it is a\n\ndescriptive rather than a procedural markup language.\n SGML is a language designed to reflect the structure or function of\n\ntext, rather than simply its layout or typography.\n In a text retrieval system, portions of an SGML document can be\n\nsearched and retrieved, and functionally different textual elements can be\n\ndisplayed in accordance with their function.\n\n  The difficulty of designing an implementation of SGML to meet a\n\nbroad range of text processing needs in the humanities has been met by the\n\nText Encoding Initiative ( TEI) in its Guidelines for Electronic Text\n\nEncoding and Interchange. [ 3]\n The application of SGML using the TEI Guidelines will play a central\n\nrole in ensuring that textual resources--particularly those important to\n\ntextual studies--are produced in a way that make them flexible and of\n\ncontinuing value.\n The TEI itself is a collaborative project of the Association for\n\nComputers and the Humanities, the Association for Computational Linguistics,\n\nand the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing.\n Its purpose is the promulgation of guidelines for the markup of\n\nelectronic text for a variety of disciplines involved in the study of text.\n In mid-1994, a comprehensive and detailed two volume set of\n\nguidelines was published.\n The print version of the TEI Guidelines is an absolutely essential\n\nacquisition by libraries; an electronic version has been made available by\n\nthe author. [ 4]\n\n  A central feature of SGML is the DTD ( Document Type Definition).\n The DTD is a codification of the possible textual characteristics in\n\na given document or set of documents.\n SGML expresses the organization of a document without necessarily\n\nusing the file system paradigm ( i.e., discrete files representing the\n\norganizational components of a document).\n It expresses textual features ( e.g., footnotes, tables, and\n\nheadings) and the building blocks of content ( e.g., paragraphs) using a\n\ndescriptive language focusing on the role of the element, rather than some\n\npresumed display value.\n SGML is not a tag set, but a grammar, with the \" vocabulary\"--or\n\ntags--of an individual document being articulated in its DTD.\n Using this rigorous grammar, SGML can both declare information about\n\nthe document in a way that can be transported with the document and can\n\nenforce rules in the application of markup by aiding in \" parsing\" the\n\ndocument.\n\n  The HyperText Markup Language ( HTML), which is used with the\n\nWeb, is a form of SGML expressed by its own unique DTD.\n The shape of the HTML DTD has changed significantly since first\n\narticulated by researchers at CERN, and it continues to change with the\n\ndemands of the Web. [ 5]\n HTML was designed to facilitate making documents available on the\n\nWeb, and it expresses a variety of features such as textual characteristics\n\nand hypertext links.\n These hypertext links are HTML 's most useful capability because they\n\nallow authors to link documents to other resources throughout the Internet,\n\neffectively making the Internet into a large hypertext document.\n\n\n  The Web is far more than a server protocol for the transfer of\n\nHTML documents.\n Among the many resources it offers in facilitating sophisticated\n\nretrieval of information is the Common Gateway Interface ( CGI).\n Like HTML, CGI is in transition.\n However, in its current state, it offers capabilities that allow the\n\nWeb to support much more complex documents and retrievals than HTML alone\n\nsupports.\n The Common Gateway Interface is a set of specifications for external\n\ngateway programs to speak to the Web 's server protocol, HTTP.\n It allows the administrator to run external programs from the Web\n\nserver in such a way that requests from the server return a desired document\n\nto the user or, more typically, generate a document on the fly.\n This capability makes it possible to provide uniform access to data\n\nstructures or servers that are completely independent of the HTTP, including\n\nstructures such as those represented in SGML documents or Z39.50 servers.\n The CGI specification is available on the NCSA documentation Web\n\nserver. [ 6]\n\n  Closely associated with the CGI is the FORM specification, which\n\nwas first introduced with NCSA 's Mosaic Web client.\n This feature is a client-independent mechanism to submit complex\n\nqueries, usually through a graphical user interface.\n FORM-compliant interfaces such as Mosaic, Lynx ( a UNIX VT100\n\nclient), and OmniWeb ( a NeXTStep client) use fill-out forms, check boxes,\n\nand lists to mediate queries between the user and CGI resources.\n Users respond by making selections that qualify submissions to the\n\nserver ( e.g., checking a box to indicate that a search is an author search)\n\nthereby making a complex command-line syntax unnecessary. [ 7]\n\n \n\n  CGI programs can be written in a variety of languages, including\n\nUNIX shell scripts, C programs, and Perl.\n In fact, there are few limitations on the type of language that can\n\nbe used.\n Perl is foremost among the options available to most Web\n\nadministrators.\n Largely the work of Larry Wall, Perl can be used to create extremely\n\nfast and flexible programs with no practical limits on the size of the\n\nmaterial it can treat.\n Perl also has outstanding support for the UNIX \" regular expression,\"\n\nmaking it ideal for text systems where one form of markup must be translated\n\nto another. [ 8]\n\n\n  The modular approach taken in the Web-to-PAT Gateway separates\n\nthe operations of retrieval to allow one component ( e.g., an SGML-to-HTML\n\nfilter) to be upgraded without affecting other components.\n It should be emphasized that this separation of operations grew out\n\nof local needs and that other approaches, including an approach that combines\n\nall operations in a single program, are possible.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n  Information returned from PAT is transformed into lists or\n\nentries that can be selected.\n\n\n \n\n  This multi-stage approach has many advantages.\n For example, it is possible to use different programming languages or\n\nother software tools for each processing stage, selecting them based on their\n\nutility for particular functions or their ability to comply with local\n\nrequirements.\n In the approach documented here, HTML FORMs, shell programs, C\n\nprograms, and Perl programs have been used for the four operations.\n Separating the functions also allows persons with different\n\nresponsibilities, skills, or interests to manage the different processes.\n For example, a system administrator might manage the second and third\n\nstages, while someone responsible for more aesthetic issues in the delivery\n\nmight manage parts of the first and the fourth stages.\n At the University of Virginia Library, SGML-to-HTML filters continue\n\nto be enhanced by staff from the Library 's Electronic Text Center in a\n\nprocess completely separate from the development of other parts of the\n\ninterface.\n\n\n  The use of an HTML FORM to handle query submission may be simple\n\nor complex.\n The three examples given here demonstrate that range: the Middle\n\nEnglish FORM supports word and phrase searches; the Oxford English Dictionary\n\nsearch provides a great deal of information about the areas to be searched\n\nand information to be retrieved; and the TEI Guidelines FORM allows users to\n\nbrowse the document in a variety of ways, such as by chapter or other\n\nsection.\n ( The Middle English and TEI Guidelines resources are encoded in\n\nSGML.)\n\n\n  The FORM created for Middle English materials was deliberately\n\nmade simple to allow users to retrieve keywords-in-context ( KWIC) without\n\nknowing commands such as those needed to view search results. [ 9]\n\n  A search term is requested from the user and registered as the\n\nvariable \" query.\" So that neither the user or system is overwhelmed by large\n\nresult sets, the size of result sets is limited to 100 items, and an\n\nadditional FORM option ( registering the variable \" size\") is included to\n\nhelp the user subsequently move through the results 100 items at a time or to\n\nsample 100 items from the entire result set.\n\n\n  The richness of the Oxford English Dictionary ( OED) is often\n\noverwhelming even for sophisticated users.\n Most users do not want keyword-in-context results and would prefer\n\nsimple look up capabilities.\n The OED is a complex product designed to facilitate a broad array of\n\nactivities.\n Consequently, even simple searches require elaborate query\n\nstructures.\n\n  The OED FORM assists users in submitting many of the most\n\ncommonly performed searches, including dictionary entry retrieval with simple\n\nlook ups and truncated term look ups ( e.g., \" photo\" for all words beginning\n\nwith this stem). [ 10]\n It is also possible to retrieve quotations by the quote 's author (\n\ne.g., retrieval of all quotations authored by Chaucer).\n\n\n  1. In the FORM, the user submits a search term which is captured\n\nas the variable \" query.\"\n\n  2. The user selects the type of search. Many types of searches\n\nare possible, including traditional look ups, alphabetic browses, full-text\n\nsearches, and quotation retrieval.\n\n  3. Several other elements are used to limit the size of results.\n As in the Middle English search FORM, a default of no more than 100\n\nresults at a time may be viewed from each search.\n\n  4. In addition, a variable called \" period\" is offered to allow\n\nusers to limit quotation searches by century.\n\n\n  The structured browsing of the TEI Guidelines adds another\n\nimportant feature for mediating access to large or complex collections.\n Users of the TEI Guidelines are as likely to want to read a chapter\n\nor section as they are to want to search the contents.\n\n  To facilitate this sort of browsing, an initial HTML page is\n\ncreated containing the titles of the major SGML hierarchical structures of\n\nthe TEI Guidelines ( e.g., the DIV0 element), and each of these structures is\n\nlinked to an HTML page containing the titles of subsidiary structures ( e.g.,\n\nthe DIV1 through DIV4 elements). [ 11]\n\n  For example, the top-level HTML page is linked to the secondary\n\nHTML page for Part I of the TEI Guidelines.

{"text": "The middle-aged woman consented to talk only after she was assured\n\nthat her anonymity would be guaranteed.\n Even then she feared giving certain details, thinking that any fact\n\nmight link her to her illegal immigrant status.\n Maria, as we will call her, sadly recalled her life in Mexico, where\n\nshe lived in a small agricultural town with her husband and son.\n The three lived in a small one-room hut.\n \" We had no running water and no electricity,\" said Maria.\n \" The roof leaked and we didn't even have a bathroom.\"\n Maria 's husband, a field worker, was out of work due to the rainy\n\nseason.\n \" My son was very ill, and we barely had enough to eat,\" said Maria.\n\n\n\n  It was for these reasons that Maria and her husband made the long,\n\narduous trek to California, in search of the American Dream.\n Maria couldn't have known what awaited her when she arrived.\n \" They say we come here, have our children, and abuse the system,\"\n\nsaid Maria.\n \" But I haven't done that.\"\n She speaks of what she calls \" a persecution of Latinos.\"\n She is referring, of course, to California 's Proposition 187, a plank\n\nin the reelection campaign of Governor Pete Wilson, which passed by a 3-2\n\nmargin, or by 59 percent of the voters, on November 8, 1994. \n\n  Proposition 187, also known as the Save our State Initiative, or\n\nS.O.S., would ban nonemergency health care, schooling, and other social\n\nservices for illegal immigrants.\n It would also require police, school, and hospital officials to\n\nreport suspected illegal immigrants to the federal Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service.\n It has currently been blocked by U.S. District Judge Mariana\n\nPfaelzer, who issued a preliminary injunction on December 14, 1994. \n\n  The enforcement of the ban on higher education for illegal\n\nimmigrants was also recently barred by a superior court judge.\n That means that the increased penalty for making, selling, or using\n\nfalse immigration documents is the only aspect of Proposition 187 that is\n\ncurrently enforceable. \n\n  The passing of Proposition 187, however, not only affects Maria\n\nbecause she is an illegal immigrant but also affects her two children.\n Before 187 passed, Maria 's four-year-old son was diagnosed with a\n\nsevere case of swollen glands.\n So severe were his medical problems that he required surgery.\n \" After Prop 187 passed, I didn't know if I should still take my son\n\nin for the operation,\" said Maria.\n \" I couldn't sleep at night, I was under so much stress.\n I kept thinking that even though Prop 187 isn't in effect now that\n\nthey would be able to use the information [ provided on the forms] against me\n\nlater when it did go into effect.\" \n\n  According to Nora Roman, a registered nurse at San Francisco\n\nGeneral Hospital, this fear is not uncommon.\n \" Proposition 187 has had chilling effects because people know that\n\nif it is upheld by the courts, the information they have shared with their\n\nhealth care service providers will no longer be confidential,\" said Roman.\n The job of the California health care worker has become increasingly\n\ndifficult since the passage of Prop. 187, according to Roman.\n \" People are so afraid, that they are not coming in for preventive\n\ncare,\" said Roman.\n \" They are waiting until they are so sick they have no choice but to\n\ncome in, and this means that they require more medical assistance.\" \n\n  The facts, however, indicate that the health-care system is\n\ngreatly overburdened by growing costs.\n The cost of providing free services to illegal immigrants in 1992 (\n\nthe most recent year for which complete statistics are available) was 1,800\n\npercent higher than the average of the costs over the previous five years,\n\naccording to California 's Department of Health Services. \n\n  Opponents of Proposition 187 argue that the increased public\n\nhealth care costs due to untreated illnesses will far exceed the money that\n\nS.O.S. would save California if enforced.\n In addition, they contend that the social damage created by an\n\nincrease in juvenile delinquency and illiteracy are far too costly.\n\n  The most controversial aspect of Prop. 187 has been its denial of\n\nbasic education to illegal immigrant children.\n In 1982, a Texas statute that would have denied the children of\n\nillegal immigrants access to elementary and high school education was struck\n\ndown by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n In the decision for Plyer v. Doe, Justice William J. Brennan wrote: \"\n\nThe children . . . can affect neither their own conduct nor their own status . . .\n Visiting condemnation on . . . an infant . . . is contrary to the\n\nbasic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship\n\nto individual responsibility or wrongdoing. . . .\n Penalizing [ them for] a legal characteristic over which children can\n\nhave little control . . . is an ineffectual-as well as unjust-way of\n\ndeterring the parent.\" \n\n  He added that an education was necessary to sustain \" our\n\npolitical and cultural heritage.\"\n The inability to read and write imposes a \" lifelong penalty and\n\nstigma\" that \" denies the means to absorb the values and skills on which our\n\nsocial order rests,\" Brennan wrote.\n Lofty rhetoric aside, the discussion always returns to the issue of\n\ncost.\n According to Texas State Senator Eddie Lucio, Jr., few people are\n\nopposed to the idea of educating the children of illegal immigrants, but the\n\nstate needs help paying for it.\n \" We're just 'reying that Congress should provide financial\n\nassistance,\" said Lucio. \n\n  Rick Oltman, chairman of Yes on 187 and the S.O.S. Committee,\n\nbelieves children are little more than political pawns for the anti-187\n\nmovement.\n \" Name one social change that you try to make that doesn't affect\n\nchildren,\" said Oltman.\n \" The opponents of Prop 187 are simply using children as an emotional\n\nweapon.\n It is the citizens' children that are being hurt by overburdened\n\nclassrooms.\" \n\n  According to Laura Alvarenga, executive assistant to the\n\nsuperintendent of schools in San Francisco, Oltman 's position is based on\n\nincorrect premises.\n \" What these people don't understand is that if Proposition 187 is\n\nupheld, schools will lose funding, both from the state and federal\n\ngovernment.\"\n\n  None of these arguments seems to appease Maria.\n Her personal experiences have led her to believe that she must keep\n\nher children out of school in order to protect them.\n \" I was buying groceries one day with my two-year-old daughter, when\n\nshe was stopped by an older man who shoved her aside,\" said Maria.\n \" I think he threw her aside because she is dark, because she is\n\nMexican.\n I don't speak English and he didn't speak Spanish, but the language\n\nof hatred was clearly understood.\"\n \" It is not only us who are affected by this hatred; our children are\n\nalso being affected.\n We would like to send them to school but because of Proposition 187,\n\nthat no longer seems possible.\n\n\n  Proposition 187 has struck fear not only in Maria 's heart but in\n\nthe hearts of all Hispanic immigrants-legal and illegal-who live near the\n\nU.S.-Mexico border or in Florida.\n The United States Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates\n\nthat 3.4 million illegal immigrants were in the United States in 1992, and\n\nthat 80 percent of them were in California, Texas, and Florida.\n With the help of determined lobbyists, anti-immigrant sentiments are\n\nspreading beyond these three key states.\n \" Proposition 187 was only the first step in dealing with the illegal\n\nimmigrant issue in the United States,\" said Oltman.\n \" We are hoping to stir national awareness of this issue.\n We want them not only to talk about illegal immigration but to start\n\ndeportation.\n\n\n  According to Texas State Senator Lucio, it is expensive and\n\npointless to try to eliminate illegal immigraton.\n He suggests that the federal government has the obligation to pay for\n\nthe services provided to illegal immigrants or \" at the very least give tax\n\nbreaks to the people who live along the border.\"\n He argues that \" any other debate can only conjure up hate and fear,\n\nand ultimately will not lead to a real solution.\"\n\n  Since its passage by the citizens of California, several states,\n\nsuch as Arizona, Washington, Oregon, and Florida, have begun to consider\n\nsimilar measures.\n There have also been 32 separate pieces of legislation presented to\n\nthe federal government relating to illegal immigration.\n \" We're se 'reng a message to the federal government that says we\n\nwon't stand for our towns to be overrun with illegal aliens while Americans\n\ngo hungry,\" said Enos Schera, vice president of Citizens of Dade County\n\nUnited, an organization that is lobbying for a measure similar to Proposition\n\n187 in Florida.\n \" There has been an over-infusion of Cubans in our state,\" he\n\ncontinued.\n \" They are eradicating our language and our culture.\n They are [ also] degrading the quality of our children 's education.\"\n \" Americans think this way because they believe what they are told,\"\n\nsaid Clara Luz Navarro, an outreach worker for the Coalition for Immigrant\n\nand Refugee Rights and Services.\n \" It is simply a game of politics.\n When there is a governmental deficiency in management, they seek out\n\na sacrificial lamb, and unfortunately in this case it is us [\n\nHispanics].\"\n\n  Other 187 opponents also cite emotional ploys by the government\n\nto divert attention from various national ills.\n \" The federal government is unable to solve the nation 's problems, so\n\nthey have created anti-immigrant sentiments,\" said Franklin Chavez, director\n\nof the Immigration Latina Foundation in Florida.\n The federal government \" lacks the charisma and foresight to solve\n\nthe problems, so they get patriotic feelings stirring in people who have\n\nthird- and fourth-generation American roots.\n These people are told they will not be taxed more if we can cut\n\nsocial service, health care, and education costs. . . .\n They are told that they are protecting the American Dream, and they\n\ncan't prove this with action, so they point fingers. at the immigrants,\n\nsaying that they are the ones destroying it.\"\n\n  President Clinton made a\n\n&dollar;1 billion federal commitment in his proposed 1996 budget to strengthen\n\nimmigration control enforcement.\n Of this amount, an increase of\n\n&dollar;370 million was budgeted for the states that have incurred the greatest\n\nexpenses relating to illegal aliens.\n Border control, enforcement, and deportation of illegal immigrants\n\nwere also earmarked for a funding increase of 27 percent.\n In response to growing anti-illegal immigrant sentiments, House\n\nSpeaker Newt Gingrich, R-Georgia, recently indicated that he will move toward\n\nnationalizing certain elements of California 's Proposition 187.\n The law Gingrich supports would duplicate a law passed by the House\n\nin early February, which limits Congress' ability to impose requirements on\n\nthe states without taking financial responsibility.\n House Republicans are discussing a similar law that would require the\n\nfederal government to either stop mandating that the states provide social\n\nservices to illegal immigrants or start paying for the costs incurred by\n\nthese mandates.\n \" We don't need something like this in Florida,\" said Chavez.\n \" We are talking about basic human rights.\n We are not in the Gestapo.\n \" Schera counters: \" The only thing that is inhumane is when illegal\n\naliens make it harder for Americans that are here.\n If you enter illegally, you are not entitled to anything,\" he argues.\n \" The incompetence of the federal government and INS officials\n\nshouldn't fall on the taxpayers.\" \n\n  According to Schera, a proposition similar to 187 would pass with\n\nno problem in the state of Florida.\n \" In Dade County there are 1,500 jobless, homeless Americans, and\n\nwe're 'ready to say enough is enough.\" In Arizona also, immigration is a\n\ntouchy issue.\n In January, 19,426 suspected illegal immigrants were arrested in\n\nTucson.\n This figure is up from 9,903 last January.\n Don F.

{"text": "Looking at the freshly painted white wall of her apartment, she\n\nwonders what it would be like just to leave the few remaining cardboard boxes\n\non the floor and never finish unpacking.\n That way she could savor the newness of her new life, the excitement\n\nof not quite remembering what 's around the corner.\n She pushes a plastic fork through the salad she got at the deli she\n\ndiscovered today.\n An elegant salad, a seductive salad of avocado, crumbled feta, red\n\npepper, black olives.\n She holds an olive on her tongue for a long second before swallowing\n\nit.\n Yes, she loves the place, she loves Berkeley, the job at the agency\n\nhas started well.\n At the moment she knows with mathematical certitude that she 's made\n\nthe right choice.\n And that 's even without taking into account the view from the balcony:\n\nover spikes of bottlebrush to a discreet blue wedge of the bay.\n She 's saving that for now, not the salad and the view at the same\n\ntime, not yet.\n Who needs any more than this?\n The phone.\n Which is a surprise.\n His voice, which she hasn't heard in months.\n She feels herself stiffening, looks toward the door as if to assure\n\nherself that it 's locked, and sees her yellow jacket hanging on the knob.\n \" How did you get my number?\"\n She 's conscious of holding the receiver a half-inch further away than\n\nusual.\n \" I've got my sources,\" he says airily.\n For a while she doesn't answer but maintains what she thinks is a\n\nchilly silence.\n It 's part instinct and part conscious signal.\n Still, she has to admire his resourcefulness.\n Of course, he was always resourceful, and with the way he lived, he\n\nhad to be.\n That 's all in the past, she reminds herself.\n It makes him less of a threat and she feels better.\n After all, he 's across the continent in Virginia.\n \" So how 's it going out there\"\" he asks.\n \" Terrific.\n Couldn't be better,\" it 's like a strong forehand whacked smartly\n\nacross the net.\n Only maybe it 's a little too strong.\n It sounds overdone.\n\n\n  For a while there 's a silence and she remembers his tall\n\nsilhouette, the long topcoat, wide shoulders.\n Just when she 's beginning to wonder if he 's still there she hears him\n\nagain: \" Tell me what you're seeing.\"\n 're laughs to herself.\n One of his little photographer 's games.\n Strangely, though, she doesn't mind acquiescing: it 's like the old\n\ntimes without being the old times.\n \" I see a room,\" she says.\n \" White walls, a sliding glass door leading to a balcony.\n The curtains are white too, there 's a green wall-to-wall carpet--\n\navocado.\n There are a few boxes on the floor.\"\n She talks slowly, expecting him to break in at any moment with a\n\nclicking sound like a man snapping a picture but all he says is \" Yeah,\" as\n\nif he 's suddenly lost interest, and she stops describing the apartment.\n It 's different out here, she wants to tell him, the air is sharp and\n\ndry, not like the South.\n Here when you step into the shade the heat doesn't follow you.\n But all at once she feels disoriented: for the moment she 's been\n\npulled back into his world, or rather, he 's re-interpreted hers, framing it.\n Something has gone out of her elation, like a wind dying down.\n \" I'm going to get wind-chimes,\" she 'mys, apropos of nothing.\n \" There 's always a breeze in the evening.\"\n He doesn't respond.\n \" Hey,\" she asks, \" are you still there?\"\n \" Yeah.\"\n The slow Carolina drawl makes the word seem longer than it is and\n\nhearing it she sees again that thin face with two distinctly different\n\nhalves, remembers the blond hair and green eyes that change color like the\n\nsea.\n She tries to gauge from the sound how much his life is under control\n\nnow.\n \" How are you doing?\" she asks.\n \" Good.\n Real good.\n I got a teaching gig for the fall.\n At the community college.\"\n \" That 's great.\"\n Maybe he does have it together, after all, though with him the\n\nquestion is always: for how long?\n \" You meet any nice new people out there?\" he asks.\n\n\n  There 's no need to tell him that she isn't interested in new\n\npeople right now, she just wants to start life clean, a tabula rasa, like\n\nthis apartment; and she wishes she could keep it that way for a while:\n\ninnocence, learning something new each day about the city, like the names of\n\nTV anchorpeople, the best places for Mexican food ( she can hear him on that\n\nsubject).\n She 's done her duty, paid her dues, her life with him is over.\n \" Think of it as four years in the Peace Corps,\" a friend in Chicago\n\nsaid, \" working in an undeveloped nation.\"\n \" Isn't the current term developing nations?\" she asked, going along\n\nwith the joke; but the friend answered, \" No, with this one there 's no\n\npossibility-- we're not talking Third Wor 'rehere, more like Seventh or\n\nEighth.?\n They laughed, drank wine.\n There were wildflowers on the bright orange tablecloth, the big lake\n\nheaved softly on the horizon-- everything seemed to float.\n It felt so good to be able to talk about all that from a distance, no\n\nlonger tied up in it, in the pain, in his mood swings, the sudden onset of\n\nlong silences, vodka before noon, suicidal glooms.\n \" Developing nations.\"\n Only later did she recognize the photographic pun.\n Now she looks around the empty white room: her canary yellow jacket\n\nslumps over the doorknob, her discarded shoes a few feet from the door.\n Home.\n She feels like the heroine at the end of a horror movie: after the\n\ndark corridors, the ominous sounds at the bottom of the stairs, mysterious\n\nshapes; after her own panting, heart pounding in her throat, she 's safe at\n\nlast, in her favorite chair, and the thud she hears in the distance is only\n\nthe plop of the folded newspaper on the porch.\n \" I want a normal life,\" she says.\n \" And I've got one now.\"\n \" Heh-heh,\" he cackles stagily, as if reading her thoughts.\n Aren't you just a little nostalgic, the laugh seems to ask, for those\n\nterrors\"\n \" How can you be sure I can't reach you even in that white apartment\n\nwith the green rug and the sliding glass door?\n Relieved that he 's joking, she answers, \" I don't .\n .\n\n\n  \" She wants to say she doesn't think any thoughts of him at all\n\nbut that wouldn't be true.\n \" I don't want cold sores,\" she says.\n \" How vain you are, my dear,\" comes the voice from across the\n\ncountry.\n \" Isn't that a little like the pot calling the kettle black?\" she\n\nsays, remembering his swaggering dramatic poses, the costumes, his staged\n\nentrances.\n But she loved it once, didn't she, their bohemian life, when she\n\nthought of herself as a serious painter?\n On one of their anniversaries they colored each other 's faces: savage\n\nstreaks of yellow under one of his eyes, a peaceful blue under the other; he\n\nput a tiny rainbow on her brow.\n \" Every time you get a cold sore you'll think of me,\" 'llsays.\n \" Aren't you sweet?\"\n \" Hey, sweetie, I don't use my magic powers on just anyone.\n You should feel flattered.\"\n Can they really be talking like this, in a harmless enough way?\n Last spring on that hot whispery street in Virginia her throat burned\n\nas if she'd swallowed l 'd, the scent of honeysuckle and mimosa pressing down\n\non her through the humid air while he stood a few feet away, holding the hand\n\nhe'd hurt when h 'dpunched a tree.\n Now here they are at different ends of the country, bantering\n\nlightly, a regular stir fry of a conversation.\n She smiles, looking at the salad 's bright colors before her.\n Is it possible that a call from him can be just a parenthesis,\n\npleasant, funny, nostalgic, in her life?\n Still, she doesn't quite trust the feeling.\n Looking at the sunlight on her white walls in California she feels\n\nprotected from that other side of him, hungry and demanding.\n She remembers a night in Carolina when he looked at her across a\n\ntable.\n It was in a roadhouse on Route 29, heavy with tobacco smoke.\n As the band played something slow and melancholy he sat there,\n\nhunched over for the longest time, silent as a stone, until he suddenly drew\n\nhimself erect.\n All the features on his pale face were the same but he'd become a\n\n'dstranger.\n \" I do not understand the person I am,\" he declared with great\n\nformality his eyes looking beyond her, beyond the fake log cabin walls of the\n\nroadhouse.\n It scared her.\n Silently she assented: he wasn't the man she thought she knew, that\n\nwas clear, that had been becoming clearer all the time.\n Days later they acted as though none of it had ever happened, as if\n\nit were a matter of washing the paint from their faces; but that night in the\n\nroadhouse was the first time she admitted to herself they weren't likely to\n\nstay together.\n Sometimes his pictures could achieve the same kind of readjustment\n\nof vision: a familiar object suddenly became mysterious, menacing;

500 million a year \" for several decades\" to replace all its wires, on top\n\nof its usual upkeep and construction costs.\n\n  The other choice is to buy existing cable systems, also\n\nexpensive.\n That 's the route Southwestern Bell is taking, buying Hauser\n\nCommunications' cable systems for\n\n&dollar; 650 million.\n\n  Either way, the business of locally transmitting information or\n\nentertainment over wires will get more competitive as phone companies and\n\ncable companies go head-to-head in most areas.\n That will force prices down and squeeze profits, much as battles\n\nbetween AT&T, MCI and Sprint chopped long-distance prices once that industry\n\nbecame competitive in the 1980s.\n\n  In the end, local phone companies won't be able to make enough\n\nmoney on their new networks to justify the expense of building or buying them\n\n- unless they can sell more than just a connection to a wire.\n\n  They'll need t 'lldd value to the networks, probably by creating\n\nand owning some of the programs and information on them.\n To get to that point, the phone companies need to buy into a media\n\ngiant like Time Warner or Viacom.\n\n  \" I don't think ( phone companies) can do it alone,\" says Peter\n\nShapiro, telecommunications consultant with Arthur D.Little.\n \" All seven regional Bells plus a big independent phone company or\n\ntwo are talking to Viacom and everybody else in the business of cable TV and\n\nprogramming.\"\n\n  That 's where the panic factor may be: There aren't a lot of\n\nfirst-class media and entertainment companies to split among seven phone\n\ncompanies.\n\n\n  \" I think you're going 're see myriad business combinations in the\n\nnext couple of years,\" US West 's McCormick says.\n\n  Deals are already flying.\n A lot of them swirl around the takeover fight for Paramount, which\n\nowns movie studios, TV programming and sports teams including the\n\nRangers.\n\n  NYNEX, the phone company in New York and New England, has agreed\n\nto put\n\n&dollar;

{"text": "The Rise and Reconceptualization of Agency in the Twentieth\n\nCentury ( Excerpt)\n\n  \" Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they\n\nplease; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but\n\nunder circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the\n\npast.\n The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on\n\nthe brain of the living\" ( Johnson, 113).\n Walter Johnson quotes this passage from Karl Marx 's The Eighteenth\n\nBrumaire of Louis Bonaparte ( 1852) as an illustration of what he considers\n\nhis \" radical\" reconceptualization of the determinants of historical change\n\nand continuity ( Johnson, 113).\n Johnson contrasts his theory of the importance of people both defined\n\nby and defining their cultural heritage ( Johnson, 119) with what he sees as\n\nNew Social History 's overly simplistic allegiance to the concept of \"\n\nagency,\" of people possessing \" independent will and volition\" and thus\n\nshaping their own history ( Johnson, 115).\n But, if our reading in this class is representative, it seems that\n\nJohnson may be drawing a false dichotomy and in turn minimizing the crucial\n\nrole these historians did play.\n The twentieth-century historians who assert agency by the subjects\n\nthey are investigating do so not in isolation but in explicit recognition of\n\nthe cultural limits that constrain their subjects' actions.\n While these historians may differ in terms of whether they put a\n\ngreater weight on self-determination or outside forces, they are united in\n\nasserting that the common people of history were generally able to exert at\n\nleast some measure of control over their actions and destinies.\n This newfound respect and appreciation for the lower classes of\n\nsociety represents a signal contribution of twentieth-century\n\nhistoriography.\n\n  It should be obvious that the concept of agency is not new to the\n\ntwentieth century.\n Much past historical writing has adhered to the \" great man\" theory\n\nof history, that powerful personages like kings, generals, and religious\n\nleaders can alter the course of history through the force of their will and\n\ninfluence.\n This attitude can be traced back to the very foundations of the\n\nhistorical discipline in ancient Greece; historians like Thucydides would\n\nargue that events such as the defeat of the Athenians in Sicily during the\n\nPeloponnesian War, \" the greatest action that we know of in Hellenic\n\nhistory,\" came about at least in part because of poor decisions by Athenian\n\ngenerals ( Thucydides, 536-37, 504, 508-11).1 As this quotation about the\n\nAthenian defeat implies, Thucydides and most other early writers of history\n\nheld that the fundamental interest of history resided in the study of great\n\npeople and events, the workings of government, diplomacy, and warfare, or\n\nwhat we would now consider political history.\n This focus on political history carried on through the scientific\n\nhistorians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries ( Burke, 7),\n\nwho though they showed interest in institutional history ( Novick, 72)\n\nnevertheless maintained an allegiance to the great men.\n Classroom discussion of such people should overlook their personal\n\nflaws \" for the sake of a great work accomplished and a noble life lived,\"\n\nrecommended a historian in 1902, and ten years earlier Woodrow Wilson\n\nstressed, \" What we need to study in schools is the united effort, the common\n\nthought, of bodies of men; of the men who make public opinion, that is of the\n\nuncritical and conservative rather than of the educated classes\" ( Novick,\n\n71).\n Clearly, among mainstream historians at the beginning of the\n\ntwentieth century, there was no room in the historical profession for a study\n\nof the common man, much less an appreciation of his or her free will.\n\n  In fact, other historiographical developments around this time\n\nperiod threatened to render the concept of agency even more obsolete.\n Though Marx may have had a more nuanced ( or inconsistent) view of\n\nhistorical determinism, if the quotation that begins this paper is any\n\nindication, the Marxist historians that followed him viewed history as\n\nreflecting the inevitable progression of society through different stages of\n\ndevelopment towards a communist utopia.\n Thus, in their interpretation of the French Revolution, \" the outcome\n\n( bourgeoisie economic and social hegemony) followed from the origins ( class\n\nconflict between bourgeoisie and aristocracy) in seemingly inexorable\n\nfashion\" ( Hunt, 4).\n Since the actions of the elite are ultimately determined for them by\n\nthe progress of history long-term and their relationship to the productive\n\nforces ( Marx 's base/superstructure model) short-term, even the upper classes\n\nand so-called great men in an orthodox Marxist interpretation of history are\n\nat the mercy of outside forces beyond their control.\n\n\n  To reach the state of affairs by the late twentieth century where\n\nthe common people of history are seen as having some ability to influence\n\ntheir fate, historiographical developments would have to occur in which\n\neither a sense of agency is restored to people in power and/or the lives of\n\nthe lower classes of society are seen as worthy of study.\n The first option in fact never became necessary, as scientific\n\nhistorians and their successors, in opposition to Marxism, continued to\n\nmaintain that elites had at least some ability to shape their lives and that\n\nof their society as a whole ( even though, as most historians came to\n\nbelieve, outside forces also had considerable influence on historical\n\ndevelopment).2 But a major shift did occur in regards to the second option,\n\nas the rise to power of the Annales movement in France helped lead to an\n\nacceptance that all fields of human endeavor, and not just political history,\n\nwere worthy subjects of research.\n This increasing attention to social and cultural history naturally\n\nled to closer examination of the lives of the common people.\n Marc Bloch 's landmark study of medieval Europe was entitled Feudal\n\nSociety so it could look broadly at the entire society, at not just feudalism\n\n( the relationships between lords and vassals) but at manorialism as well (\n\nthe relationships between lords and serfs) ( Bloch, 239-79).\n In keeping with the Annales movement, though, Bloch 's goal is \" to\n\nanalyze and explain a social structure and its unifying principles\" ( Bloch,\n\nxix).\n Any changes to this structure must come slowly, over the long term,\n\nso even though the lives of peasants are now seen as an important\n\ncharacteristic of that system, individual peasants ( and individual elites)\n\ncan play no role in bringing about meaningful change ( for themselves or the\n\nsociety).\n\n  David A. Bell sees the 1970 's as producing a fundamental turn\n\naway from the Annales approach of \" total history.\" Discomfort with the\n\nimpersonality of quantitative history in looking at the lower classes and\n\ndisillusionment with Marxism and its focus on impersonal forces led to an\n\ninterest in \" history from below,\" the study of common people and their\n\nability to shape their own futures separate from what elites or Marxist\n\ndoctrine might expect ( Bell, 266-67).\n This interest in agency among the lower classes came from many sides,\n\nincluding from historians of the new cultural turn ( who were themselves also\n\ninfluenced by cultural anthropologists like Clifford Geertz),\n\nmicrohistorians, and even from historians from the Annales and Marxist\n\nmovements.3 New Marxist historians like E.P. Thompson and ( later) Eugene D.\n\nGenovese rejected economic determinism and, though still interested in class\n\nand class struggle, started paying particular attention to the \" lived\n\nexperience\" of the common people ( Novick, 440-42; Bell, 266-67).\n They accepted and even stressed human agency in the lower classes,\n\nbut it was an awareness that human ability to affect their own lives was\n\nitself constrained by the broader society.\n Thus, E.P. Thompson rejects the common notion that the crowds in\n\nEnglish food riots of the eighteenth century represented an irrational,\n\nunruly mob by instead emphasizing that the members of these crowds had\n\nspecific objectives in mind, acted with restraint, and believed their actions\n\nto be legitimate.\n Nevertheless, these \" legitimizing notion[s]\" that justified their\n\nactions reflected an acceptance by the lower classes of the old paternalistic\n\nideas of the proper way grain should be distributed ( Thompson, 78, 76-136).\n Genovese sees slaves and slaveholders in the antebellum American\n\nSouth as both accepting the hegemonic world view of paternalism, of belonging\n\nto one \" family, white and black,\" but by doing so slaves accepted the system\n\nof slavery and failed to imagine themselves as a class who could rise up and\n\noverthrow it.\n Nevertheless, they asserted agency by learning to work within the\n\nsystem for their own benefit, by creating a culture that merged American and\n\nAfrican influences and by asserting claims of paternalism to acquire rights\n\nand privileges from their masters ( Genovese, 73, 133-49).\n Historians have certainly raised major qualms about the validity of\n\nGenovese 's concepts of hegemony and paternalism in describing the antebellum\n\nSouth ( e..g, Johnson, 117), but the key point is that both Thompson and\n\nGenovese held a vision of the lower classes that recognized their ability to\n\nassert agency within constraints.\n\n  Given the underlying philosophy behind their theoretical\n\nframeworks, Annales and Marxist historians clearly had to recognize the\n\nlimits of agency.\n Thus, the most explicit and emphatic proclamations of the common\n\nperson 's ability to shape their own destinies came from the cultural\n\nhistorians and microhistorians of the 1970 's and later.\n In her study of the religious piety of medieval European women,\n\nCaroline Bynum stressed her desire to restore the \" creativity and dignity\"\n\nof her subjects, who demonstrated \" a chosen suffering, a chosen excreting,\n\nthat washed, fed, and saved the world\" ( Bynum, 299, 274).\n Bynum rejected the traditional interpretations of medieval female\n\npiety that saw these religious women as accepting the misogynistic beliefs of\n\nthe dominant male society and who thus \" hated their bodies and their\n\nsexuality, we are told, and punished them through fasting and other forms of\n\nself-mutilation\" ( Bynum, 208).\n Rather, she sees these food practices as empowering, allowing these\n\nwomen to assert their independence in a male-dominated world and even\n\npossessing certain practical advantages ( e.g., avoidance of marriage).\n Richard White also looks for agency in his examination of the middle\n\nground of North America between the French and the Algonquians in the\n\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries; he explicitly identifies his goal as [\n\nplacing] Indian peoples at the center of the scene and [ seeking] to\n\nunderstand the reasons for their actions\" ( White, xi).\n He also finds this exertion of free will, in arguing that the middle\n\nground that was formed represented a \" joint Indian-white creation\" in which\n\nneither side predominated ( White, xiv). \n\n  In stressing these expressions of agency among the common people,\n\nboth Bynum and White are reacting against earlier historiography that cast\n\ntheir subjects as victims of men or European colonizers.\n But both of them properly recognize the limits of this agency.\n After all, how free can medieval women be if their only way to avoid\n\nmarriage is to starve themselves to death?\n Bynum understands that by modern standards, the lives these women\n\nlived would be very undesirable; \" no one could wish to return to a society\n\nin which the horrors of leprosy, gangrene, or starvation can be mitigated\n\nonly by symbols that glorify pain and sacrifice\" ( Bynum, 299).\n White also explains how the middle ground was only possible in a\n\nsociety where neither the French nor the Algonquian possessed a material\n\nadvantage; when the Americans were able to assert dominance, they crushed the\n\nIndians.\n Cultural historians may choose to stress the choices their subjects\n\nhave, but they still recognize the societal constraints.\n Such is also the case for microhistorians.\n Edward Muir, in his introduction to an important collection of\n\nmicrohistories, makes the focus of such studies clear: \" individuals making\n\nchoices and developing strategies within the constraints of their own time\n\nand place\" ( Muir, viii).\n\n  What Johnson refers to as Marx 's apparently \" radical\" treatment\n\nof individuals making choices within constraints appears in fact to have\n\nbecome predominant among modern scholarship.\n The issue at question is no longer whether agency is limited but\n\nrather which condition ( choice or constraint) will be stressed.\n Timothy Garton Ash 's The File explores the choice between\n\ncollaboration and resistance faced by individuals in a totalitarian state.\n He acknowledges the severe constraints, noting for example that \" as\n\na senior state employee Michaela was certainly obliged to cooperate with the\n\nStasi\" ( Garton Ash, 107) and wondering if Britain would be any different if\n\nit was totalitarian ( Garton Ash, 134).\n But throughout the book, he stresses how the informers and officials\n\nhe interviews did have a choice; he is critical, for example, of the common\n\nStasi officer defense that he was just doing his job ( Garton Ash, 180).\n His most extreme case of valuing agency over limitations comes in his\n\ndescription of the English professor \" Smith\" 's choice to become an informer:\n\n\" The wrong decision, of course, but completely understandable\" ( Garton Ash,\n\n137).\n But what could Garton Ash reasonably expect?\n \" Smith,\" as a means to entrap him into becoming an informer, was\n\naccused by the Stasi of being a spy, which if it led to his expulsion would\n\nhave meant his separation from his wife and child.\n Garton Ash does not examine the likelihood that the Stasi would have\n\nexpelled him based on this false accusation, or the degree to which \" Smith\"\n\nshould have known they were bluffing and/or would have followed through with\n\nthe implicit threat.\n And, since informing definitely allowed him to stay with his family,\n\nmight that not have been clearly the right decision for him?\n Though asserting agency within constraints may have become the\n\ndominant theme of historiography in the twentieth century, clearly\n\ninteresting questions on how one balances those factors will remain.\n And the story of \" Smith\" demonstrates another important development\n\nof historical scholarship of the last century: Garton Ash places so much\n\nemphasis on \" Smith\" 's choice because his decision to become an informer\n\nquite possibly had critical and debilitating consequences in the lives of\n\nthose he informed on and ( in the aggregate) in propping up the East German\n\nsystem as a whole.\n The lives of common people do matter, and by approaching them through\n\nan \" agency within limits\" paradigm, twentieth-century historians have\n\nallowed us to see why this is so.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2f5cfc24-9e33-4e59-9350-9fb7e091025f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.791200+00:00"}
{"text": "The week the last Internet porn scandal broke, my phone didn't\n\nstop ringing: ?\n Are women comfortable on the Net??\n ? Should women use gender-neutral names on the Net??\n ? Are women harassed on the Net??\n Reporters called from all over the country with basically the same\n\nquestion.\n I told them all: your question is ill-formed.\n ? The Net?\n is not one thing.\n It 's like asking: ? Are women comfortable in bars??\n That 's a silly question.\n Which woman?\n\n\n  The summer I was 18, I was the computer counselor at a summer\n\ncamp.\n After the campers were asleep, the counselors were allowed out, and\n\nwould go bar hopping.\n First everyone would go to Maria 's, an Italian restaurant with\n\nred-and- white-checked table cloths.\n Maria welcomed everyone from behind the bar, greeting regular\n\ncustomers by name.\n She always brought us free garlic bread.\n Next we'd go to the Sandpipe 'd a disco with good dance music.\n The Sandpiper seemed excitingly adult--it was a little scary at\n\nfirst, but then I loved it.\n Next, we went to the Sportsman, a leather motorcycle bar that I found\n\nabsolutely terrifying.\n Huge, bearded men bulging out of their leather vests and pants leered\n\nat me.\n I hid in the corner and tried not to make eye contact with anyone,\n\nhoping my friends would get tired soon and give me a ride back to camp. \n\n  Each of these bars was a community, and some were more\n\ncomfortable for me than others.\n The Net is made up of hundreds of thousands of separate communities,\n\neach with its own special character.\n Not only is the Net a diverse place, but ? women? are diverse as\n\nwell--there were leather-clad women who loved the Sportsman, and plenty of\n\nwomen revel in the fiery rhetoric of Usenet 's alt.flame.\n When people complain about being harassed on the Net, they've usually\n\nstumbled in 'vethe wrong online community.\n The question is not whether ? women? are comfortable on ? the Net,?\n\nbut rather what types of communities are possible? How can we create a range\n\nof communities so that everyone--men and women--can find a place that is\n\ncomfortable for them? \n\n  If you're looking for a res 'rerant or bar, you can often tell\n\nwithout even going in: Is the sign flashing neon or engraved wood?\n Are there lots of cars parked out front?\n What sort of cars? ( You can see all the Harleys in front of the\n\nSportsman from a block away.)\n Look in the window: How are people dressed?\n We are accustomed to diversity in restaurants.\n People know that not all restaurants will please them, and employ a\n\nvariety of techniques to choose the right one. \n\n  It 's a lot harder to find a good virtual community than it is to\n\nfind a good bar.\n The visual cues that let you spot the difference between Maria 's and\n\nthe Sportsman from across the street are largely missing.\n Instead, you have to ? lurk?- enter the community and quietly explore\n\nfor a while, getting the feel of whether it 's the kind of place you're\n\nlooking for 're Although published guides exist, they're not always ver 'reseful--most\n\ncontain encyclopedic lists with little commentary or critical evaluation, and\n\nby the time they're published they 're already out of 'rete.\n Magazines like NetGuide and Wired are more current and more\n\nselective, and therefore more useful, but their editorial bias may not fit\n\nwith your personal tastes. \n\n  Commonly available network-searching tools are also useful.\n The World Wide Web is filled with searching programs, indexes, and\n\neven indexes of indexes ( ? meta-indexes?).\n Although browsing with these tools can be a pleasant diversion, it is\n\nnot very efficient, and searches for particular pieces of information often\n\nend in frustration.\n If you keep an open mind, however, you may come across something\n\ngood. \n\n\n  But what happens if, after exploring and asking around, you still\n\ncan't find an online environment that suits you?\n Don't give up: start your own!\n This doesn't have to be a difficult task.\n Anyone can create a new newsgroup in Usenet 's ? alt? hierarchy or\n\nopen a new chat room on America Online.\n Users of Unix systems can easily start a mailing list.\n If you have a good idea but not enough technical skill or the right\n\ntype of Net access, there are people around eager to help.\n The more interesting question is: How do you help a community to\n\nbecome what you hope for? Here, I can offer some hard-won advice. \n\n  In my research at the MIT Media Lab ( working with Professor\n\nMitchel Resnick), I design virtual communities.\n In October of 1992, I founded a professional community for media\n\nresearchers on the Internet called MediaMOO.\n Over the past three years, as MediaMOO has grown to 1,000 members\n\nfrom 33 countries, I have grappled with many of the issues that face anyone\n\nattempting to establish a virtual community.\n MediaMOO is a ? multi-user dungeon? or MUD--a virtual world on the\n\nInternet with rooms, objects, and people from all around the world.\n Messages typed in by a user instantly appear on the screens of all\n\nother users who are currently in the same virtual ? room.?\n This real-time interaction distinguishes MUDs from Usenet newsgroups,\n\nwhere users can browse through messages created many hours or days before.\n The MUD 's virtual world is built in text descriptions.\n MOO stands for MUD object-oriented, a kind of MUD software ( created\n\nby Pavel Curtis of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and Stephen White, now\n\nat InContext Systems) that allows each user to write programs to define\n\nspaces and objects. \n\n  The first MUDS, developed in the late 1970s, were multiplayer\n\nfantasy games of the dungeons-and-dragons variety.\n In 1989, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University named James\n\nAspnes decided to see what would happen if you took away the monsters and the\n\nmagic swords but instead let people extend the virtual world.\n People 's main activity went from trying to conquer the virtual world\n\nto trying to build it, collaboratively. \n\n  Most MUDs are populated by undergraduates who should be doing\n\ntheir homework.\n I thought it would be interesting instead to bring together a group\n\nof people with a shared intellectual interest: the study of media.\n Ideally, MediaMOO should be like an endless reception for a\n\nconference on media studies.\n But given the origin of MUDs as violent games, giving one an\n\nintellectual and professional atmosphere was a tall order.\n How do you guide the evolution of who uses the space and what they do\n\nthere? \n\n  A founder/designer can't control what the community ultimately\n\nbecomes--much of that is up to the users--but can help shape it.\n The personality of the community 's founder can have a great influence\n\non what sort of place it becomes.\n Part of what made Maria 's so comfortable for me was Maria herself.\n\n\n  Similarly, one of the most female-friendly electronic communities\n\nI've visited i 'veew York City 's ECHO ( East Coast Hang Out) bulletin board,\n\nrun by Stacy Horn.\n Smart, stylish, and deliberately outrageous, Horn is role model and\n\npatron saint for the ECHO-ites.\n Her outspoken but sensitive personality infuses the community, and\n\nsends a message to women that it 's all right to speak up.\n She added a conference to ECHO called ?\n WIT?\n ( women in telecommunications), which one user describes as ?\n a warm, supportive, women-only, private conference where women 's\n\nthoughts, experiences, wisdom, joys, and despairs are shared.?\n But Horn also added a conference called ? BITCH,? which the ECHO-ite\n\ncalls ? WIT in black leather jackets.\n\n\n  Horn 's high-energy, very New York brand of intelligence\n\nestablishes the kind of place ECHO is and influences how everyone there\n\nbehaves.\n When ECHO was first established, Horn and a small group of her close\n\nfriends were the most active people on the system.\n ? That set the emotional tone, the traditional style of posting, the\n\nunwritten rules about what it 's OK to say,?\n says Marisa Bowe, an ECHO administrator for many years.\n ? Even though Stacy is too busy these days to post very much, the\n\ntone established in the early days continues,? says Bowe, who is now editor\n\nof an online magazine called Word. \n\n  Beyond the sheer force of a founder 's personality, a community\n\nestablishes a particular character with a variety of choices on how to\n\noperate.\n One example is to set a policy on whether to allow participants to\n\nremain anonymous.\n Initially, I decided that members of MediaMOO should be allowed to\n\nchoose: they could identify themselves with their real names and e-mail\n\naddresses, or remain anonymous.\n Others questioned whether there was a role for anonymity in a\n\nprofessional community. \n\n  As time went on, I realized they were right.\n People on MediaMOO are supposed to be networking, hoping someone will\n\nlook up who they really are and where they work.\n Members who are not wi11ng to share their personal and professional\n\nidentities are less likely to engage in serious discussion about their work\n\nand consequently about media in general.\n Furthermore, comments from an anonymous entity are less valuable\n\nbecause they are unsituated-- \" I believe X\" is less meaningful to a listener\n\nthan \" I am a librarian with eight years of experience who lives in a small\n\ntown in Georgia, and I believe X.\"\n In theory, anonymous participants could describe their professional\n\nexperiences and place their comments in that context; in practice it tends\n\nnot to happen that way.\n After six months, I proposed that we change the policy to require\n\nthat all new members be identified.\n Despite the protests of a few vocal opponents, most people thought\n\nthat this was a good idea, and the change was made. \n\n  Each community needs to have its own policy on anonymity.\n There 's room for diversity here too: some communities can be\n\nall-anonymous, some all-identified, and some can leave that decision up to\n\neach individual.\n An aside: right now on the Net no one is either really anonymous or\n\nreally identified.\n It is easy to fake an identity; it is also possible to use either\n\ntechnical or legal tools to peer behind someone else 's veil of anonymity.\n This ambiguous state of affairs is not necessarily unfortunate: it 's\n\nnice to know that a fake identity that provides a modicum of privacy is easy\n\nto construct, but that in extreme cases such people can be tracked down. \n\n\n  Another important design decision is admissions policy.\n Most places on the Net have a strong pluralistic flavor, and the\n\nidea that some people might be excluded from a community ruffles a lot of\n\nfeathers.\n But exclusivity is a fact of life.\n MIT wouldn't be MIT if everyone who wanted to come was admitted.\n Imagine if companies had to give jobs to everyone who applied!\n Virtual communities, social clubs, universities, and corporations\n\nare all groups of people brought together for a purpose.\n Achieving that purpose often requires that there be some way to\n\ndetermine who can join the community. \n\n  A key decision I made for MediaMOO was to allow entry only to\n\npeople doing some sort of \" media research.\"\n I try to be loose on the definition of \" media\"--writing teachers,\n\ncomputer network administrators, and librarians are all working with forms of\n\nmedia--but strict on the definition of \" research.\"\n At first, this policy made me uncomfortable.\n I would nervously tell people, \" It 's mostly a self-selection\n\nprocess.\n We hardly reject anyone at all!\"\n Over time, I've 'vecome more comfortable with this restriction, and\n\nhave enforced the requirements more stringently.\n\n\n  Even if an online community decides to admit all comers, it does\n\nnot have to let all contributors say anything they want.\n The existence of a moderator to filter postings often makes for more\n\nfocused and civil discussion.\n Consider Usenet 's two principal newsgroups dealing with feminism-\n\nalt.feminism and soc.feminism.\n In alt.feminism, anyone can post whatever they want.\n Messages in this group are filled with the angry words of angry\n\npeople; more insults than ideas are exchanged.\n ( Titles of messages found there on a randomly selected day included\n\n\" Women & the workplace ( it doesn't work)\" and \" What is a feminazi\"?.)\n The topic may nominally be feminism, but the discussion itself is\n\nnot feminist in nature. \n\n  The huge volume of postings ( more than 200 per day, on average)\n\nshows that many people enjoy writing such tirades.\n But if I wanted to discuss some aspect of feminism, alt.feminism\n\nwould be the last place I' 'dgo.\n Its sister group, soc.feminism, is moderated--volunteers read\n\nmessages submitted to the group and post only those that pass muster.\n Moderators adhere to soc.feminism 's lengthy charter, which explains\n\nthe criteria for acceptable postings--forbidding ad hominem attacks, for\n\ninstance.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "85ade23c-a27f-49cf-a236-5eb0d5159223", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.792836+00:00"}
{"text": "\" You can teach an old dog new tricks!,\" commented an 11-year-old \"\n\nteacher\" after introducing his 60-year-old \" student\" to computers in\n\nComputer Ease.\n When asked what he would add to the three- session course the\n\nenthusiastic 60-year-old said, \" 52 more weeks!\" \n\n  Computer Ease is an intergenerational computer literacy program to\n\nincrease utilization of existing equipment and staff.\n Computer Ease is a collaborative effort between the Upper Arlington\n\nSenior Center and Tremont Elementary School.\n Both agencies are located adjacent to one another in Upper Arlington,\n\nOhio, a suburb of Columbus.\n The senior center is sponsored by the city 's parks and recreation\n\ndepartment, under the direction of Ken Thompson. \n\n  In 1986, Senior Program Coordinator, Susan Drenning noticed a\n\nwidening gap between her center participants and their grandchildren.\n Grandparents complained to her that their grandchildren were glued to\n\ncomputers when they visited.\n Meanwhile, the grandparents were developing a fear of computers.\n Even if the grandparents wanted to learn about computers, the only\n\ncomputer courses available to them were expensive and too fast paced or only\n\navailable in the evening.\n Consequently, grandparents were having problems communicating\n\neffectively with their high- tech grandchildren. \n\n  Haven't we all had a fear of computers?\n Remember the day a computer was placed on your desk?\n You were expected to use it or lose it ( the job that is).\n Some people close to retirement chose early retirement over computer\n\nliteracy.\n Others simply avoided their computer for several months hoping it\n\nwould go away.\n Meanwhile children were becoming computer literate in schools across\n\nour nation as schools responded to social expectations.\n\n  Computer Ease bridges the gap.\n Developed by teachers David Heigle and Lou Getz in collaboration with\n\nSenior Center Director Susan Drenning, Computer Ease is designed to ease\n\nolder adults into the world of high tech through the patient, uninhibiting\n\ninstruction of elementary school students. \n\n  Goals of the program include: * Providing a hands-on,\n\nuninhibiting computer experience for older adults.\n * Allowing students to switch from learner to mentor.\n * Creating an awareness of each other 's attributes.\n\n\n  Computer Ease sessions are held four times a year in computer\n\nlabs at Greensview Elementary School as well as Tremont Elementary School.\n Older adults ( 60 to 96) and their young teachers ( ten to 11) work\n\none-on-one for one-and-one-half hours, three times per session. \n\n  In the first class, the older adults learn why and how schools\n\nuse computers to teach geography, mathematics, spelling and social studies.\n They use computer software programs such as \" Where in the World is\n\nCarmen San Diego,\" \" Concentration\" and \" Oregon Trail. \" \n\n  Next, participants learn to design their own personalized\n\nletterhead and greeting cards using Apple 's Print Shop.\n They often create cards for their grandchildren.\n In the final meeting, the students use Appleworks to help their older\n\nbuddy use the computer as a word processor.\n The older adults often write a letter to their grandchildren to show\n\ntheir new-found computer literacy and their appreciation for their student \"\n\nteacher\". \n\n  This program brings out the best in both age groups.\n Students seem to view the older adults as older peers who are also\n\nlearners.\n They are on their best behavior and often invite their older friends\n\nto participate in other intergenerational programs between the senior center\n\nand the school, or to Grandperson 's Day activities. \n\n  Comments from evaluation sheets prove that the goals of the\n\nprogram are right on target.\n In their evaluations the older adults say: * It was not as difficult\n\nas they thought it would be.\n * They didn't expect it to be as easy as the children made it for\n\nthem.\n * They liked the hands-on experience ( making something as opposed to\n\nobserving).\n * They found a new friend and were pleased with their \" teacher 's\"\n\nenthusiasm. \n\n  Many of the older adults offer to volunteer in the school\n\ncomputer lab. \n\n  The students say: * They like teaching people instead of having\n\npeople teach them.\n * \" All old people are smarter than you think.\n \" * They like the additional opportunity to work with computers.\n\n\n  Now that these older adults are computer literate, they are\n\npurchasing their own computers, getting jobs using computers, requesting and\n\nreceiving computer donations for their own senior center lab, developing\n\nfollow-up word processing classes at their own center and returning to the\n\nschools to volunteer as a lab assistant in the school computer lab .\n\n\n  Computer Ease in Upper Arlington is inexpensive--we use existing\n\nequipment and staff located in the adjacent Tremont Elementary School.\n To develop a similar program in your location you should consider the\n\nequipment and staff available, existing software and proximity between\n\nstudent and older adult groups.\n Then take the Computer Ease idea, combine it with resources available\n\nin your community, and help more older adults become computer literate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Yes, it 's time again to review the Macintosh scene and evaluate\n\nindustry saints and sinners.\n This year, as usual, consumers coped with uneven treatment in the\n\nareas of quality, service, and support.\n Which companies are basking in the glow of good deeds done and have\n\nearned a halo? Which have shown the more devilish bent illustrated by\n\nhorns?\n Keep reading to find out.\n ( Listings are in alphabetical order.\n\n\n  Adobe Systems, Kensington Microware, and Microsoft Corporation\n\nall earned halos with their exemplary records of being responsive to the\n\nreader complaints that MacWorld forwards.\n ( By the way, when I praise companies for being responsive to\n\ncomplaints, that doesn't necessarily mean that the customers are always\n\nsatisfied with the outcome.\n It does mean, though, that each company has been thoughtful,\n\ncommunicative, and polite in addressing customers' concerns. ) \n\n  Information service American Online rates horns for a billing\n\nproblem that began last August and still existed in November.\n Some Macintosh user find themselves being charged for time spent in\n\nfree areas.\n Moreover, 9600-bps access still isn't available to the masses.\n ( One nice move-AOL promises there will be no extra charge for\n\n9600-bps service, once it arrives.) \n\n  It 's been a year of great change for Apple and its customers, as\n\nMichael Spindler took charge, the company downsized, John Sculley left, and\n\nMacintosh model after Macintosh model was rolled out the door.\n As usual, Apple 's has been both a saint and a sinner.\n Its heavenly practices include continuing to drop prices on its\n\ncomputers, making them truly competitive with Intel-based machines.\n Apple also introduced the first desktop computer ( the Color Classic)\n\nthat meets the Environmental Protection Agency 's Green Star guidelines for\n\nreduced power consumption ( the sleep mode cuts electricity use by half when\n\nthe machine is not in use).\n And the Earth 's ozone layer is sure to be grateful that Apple dropped\n\nits worldwide chlorofluorocarbon emissions from manufacturing to zero in 1993\n\nfrom a peak of 270,000 pounds in l990. \n\n  But Apple again showed its devilish side with inaccurate or\n\ninadequate product specs.\n Contrary to the Apple Catalog description and other product\n\nliterature, the Quadra 61O 8/16O does not include a math coprocessor.\n And contrary to the box packaging and reassurances by some\n\nsalespeople, the Performa 475 does not use a standard O4O chip but the\n\n68LCO4O instead.\n So it doesn't include a math coprocessor either ( but at least it\n\ndoesn't actually claim to), much to the disappointment of a few Macworld\n\nreaders.\n Hello gray scale--it turns out the Quadra84OAV can't capture color\n\nQuickTime video when used with monitors larger than 16 Inches--but dealers\n\ndon't know that.\n Apple also discontinued its credit card program for purchasing Apple\n\nproducts last August--without directly informing its customers outside\n\nCalifornia that their cards were now worthless.\n Finally, the company 's track record for resolved customer complaints\n\nis improving but not yet sterling.\n In some cases Apple requires people to sign away their legal rights\n\nin order to get a settlement--and not necessarily a good one. \n\n  Mail-order companies APS, MacDepot ( now part of MacMall),\n\nMacWarehouse, and MacZone are saints in my book for responding promptly to\n\neach reader complaint I bring to their attention. \n\n  DayStar Digital earns a halo for a low-cost upgrade promotion and\n\nhorns for somewhat spotty execution of the offer.\n In 1992, the company offered a\n\n&dollar;99 upgrade to a 33MHz O4O board to Mac owners who bought by October 31 a 50\n\nMHz 030 PowerCache accelerator that included a math coprocessor.\n More than a year later, the promised 040 upgrade had not materialized\n\naccording to three customers who apparently fell through the cracks and were\n\ngetting restive about the wait.\n In its defense, DayStar points out that hundreds of customers have\n\nupgraded successfully to the O4O board. \n\n  Game company Graphic Simulations Corporation took a lot of time\n\nto produce its second flight simulator, F/A-18 Hornet.\n But in contrast to some others in the industry, GSC reportedly kept\n\nits customers up-to-date on progress with the game.\n The company also actively recruited suggestions for improving the\n\ngame and then incorporated many of those suggestions.\n Finally, the company maintains active and responsive online technical\n\nsupport.\n So Graphic Simulations earned its halo for maintaining communications\n\nwith customers and providing consistent technical support. \n\n  Bugs are an unfortunate fact of life for any computer Developer\n\nbut some bugs are more painful than others.\n Microtek Lab landed on the sinners list this year because of problems\n\nwith the ScanMaker II and the scanner 's accompanying Photoshop plug-in.\n The ScanMaker II comes set with SCSI ID 6; version 2.03 of Microtek 's\n\nPhotoshop plug-in could delete the contents of a hard drive if the drive also\n\nused SCSI ID 6.\n Mirotek tried to fix the problem with version 2. 04 of its software.\n But 2.O4 sometimes writes to a removable disk drive as though it were\n\na scanner, erasing the disk.\n Ouch.\n\n\n  Mirror wins both horns and halo.\n A halo because it bundles a full version of Adobe Photoshop with its\n\nscanners, not a limited version like some other companies.\n Horns because it ran two inaccurate advertisements early last year\n\nthat offered a lifetime warranty on its products.\n ( At the time Mirror believed it could work out a new warranty\n\nagreement with its suppliers, which turned out to be incorrect.\n\n\n  Pastel Development Corporation may have a winner in its DayMaker\n\n3.\n 0, but some disgruntled customers report that during the many months\n\nPastel was working on version 3.0, the company was not responding to phone\n\ncalls.\n One example is reader Randy Anderson.\n He prepaid for the upgrade to 3.0 in October 1992 and didn't get a\n\nresponse to his letters or phone calls about his purchase between April and\n\nlate October, when 3. 0 finally landed in his mailbox. \n\n  Quark 's policy that registered customers must pay the full fee\n\nfor replacement software and manuals should the software be lost in, for\n\nexample, a hurricane, doesn't really rate additional comment--just a pair of\n\nhorns. \n\n  Shiva Corporation gets dinged for its failure to be responsive\n\nonline in its own forums on CompuServe and America Online for several months\n\nin 1993.\n The good news is that the company hired an online support person who\n\nmade his debut in November, which should salvage the situation. \n\n  Last April a Georgia-based company called SofTeam promised to\n\noffer great customer support for its dynamic- model spreadsheet called\n\nFlippant, in the form of bug notification, free bug-fixes, and a monthly\n\nnewsletter.\n At the same time, the company was raising capital by selling\n\nFlippant while the product was still under development.\n SofTeam gets both a halo and horns; the halo is for being more\n\nhonest than many companies in admitting its software isn't really there yet.\n Raising capital by selling software still under development is novel\n\nbut not particularly customer-friendly, which is why the company--which I\n\nhaven't been able to locate--also deserves a set of horns. \n\n  State of the Art alienated some customers this year after it\n\ntook over the Accountant Inc.\n line of products and declined to continue supporting customers who\n\ndid not upgrade to Accountant version 3. 5. 2.\n That 's a business decision the company felt justified in making.\n But a letter mailed out in July really ticked off some folks.\n State of the Art explained that it made the decision not to support\n\nolder versions of the program \" at the potential cost of customer goodwill,\n\ncorporate reputation, and future revenue,\" and later states \" there will not\n\nbe any further individual responses concerning the issues addressed in this\n\nletter.\n \" State of Art earns its horns not for what it considered a\n\nnecessary business decision but for its not- very-businesslike communication\n\nof that decision to its customers. \n\n  Virtus Corporation responded admirably to the approximately 700\n\ncustomers who ordered copies of Virtual Sketch Pad for\n\n&dollar;60.

- understanding what you're\n\ngetting into 're what you'll need 'll get into it.\n But, without this section, it is hard to really know what you're doing\n\nor why 're/p>\n\n  Scale modeling is time consuming, and as a result this HOW TO will\n\nbe in several parts, the first being the most basic in that it will cover\n\nselecting a model, thinking about paint layers and understanding the concepts\n\nand challenges in scale modeling.\n Also, the length of this write up will significantly decrease the\n\nlength of the articles to come when we go through the actual building,\n\npainting, and finishing processes over the next several weeks.\n Be forewarned, building a model may feel like it drags on, but rushing\n\na job will result in a really low quality build.\n As I stated, this will likely be the longest of my HOW TO series, but\n\nit is also the most important and will hopefully lay a foundation on the\n\nthings to come. \n\n  The first thing to note is that with any scale model the idea is\n\nto be as close to perfect as possible.\n This adds to the amount of time it should take to build one.\n Things like how much detail a kit has, moving parts and the\n\ncomplexity of the kit itself make dissolve any static timeline in scale\n\nmodeling. \n\n  It really doesn't matter where your interests lie, be they\n\naircraft, cars, armor ( tanks and military vehicles), or ships ( wooden or\n\notherwise), each type of model has its own specific obstacles that surface on\n\nall models of that type.\n As an example, a huge challenge in aircraft is understanding that no\n\naircraft will look 'factory fresh' unless the model is to look like a\n\nrestored museum item and therefore a lot of time and reflection will be\n\nneeded for weathering the paint job effectively.\n With that, determining where your interests lie is one step closer to\n\nknowing or figuring out what brand of model to assemble.\n\n\n  So once, you've figured out what it 've you want to build, it 's\n\ngood to know who makes what and to what quality they make them.\n I'll jus 'llo ahead and state for the record, that while I'm not\n\ndirectly adv 'mtising for Tamiya, they are in my honest opinion the BEST\n\nmodels that you can buy ( despite their very high price point).\n As a result I'll mai 'll talk about the Tamiya brand and later HOW TO\n\narticles will be on a Tamiya model ( of either the Yamaha YZR-M1 50th\n\nAnniversary or Tamiyas newest release ( end of January), the Lamborghini\n\nCountach LP500S - - I'll let 'llu decide which you'd li 'd me to go over) \n\n  There are several reputable model manufacturers out there.\n Choosing a model largely depends on several factors, the first being\n\nin what scale you wish to build.\n I build in two scales: 1/24 and 1/12 ( which are usually cars and\n\nmotorcycles).\n The second factor being to what level of detail do you wish to\n\nachieve.\n Some models are 'curbside' meaning they have no engine, just a closed\n\nhood.\n Some models don't have steerable wheels, but most have rolling\n\nwheels.\n Some models are molded in grey resin while others come with metal\n\nplated or dyed parts.\n It just depends on what you want to achieve.\n Some manufactures only make models in certain scales or only make\n\nthem of certain materials . \n\n  The last thing that should be taken into consideration when\n\nselecting a model is how well you know the item you are building.\n Some kits aren't as accurate as they'd ha 'd you believe.\n For instance I recently built my father a replica of his first car\n\nwhen he was a teenager - - a 1966 GTO with the 389 Tri Power and the ultra\n\nrare factory installed Ram Air, Hurst 4 on the floor shifter in Fontaine Blue\n\nwith Aqua interior.\n Aside from what he would reminisce, I knew VERY little about the car\n\nand spent a month doing deep research on the car, saved 500 some odd pictures\n\nof the inside ( interior and engine bay) and outside ( even the\n\nundercarriage), what the extras for the car were, etc. prior to even starting\n\nto build the model. \n\n  Some of that stuff has no bearing if you know that these parts\n\nwon't be seen - - for instance you can glue a hood closed and forego the\n\nengine when you really don't feel like messing with it ( but kits with\n\nengines cost more so it 's like wasting money). \n\n  The kit itself came with two side mirrors and Rally II wheels.\n The instructions called for the window trim to be flat black and the\n\nstock six-pack wasn't configured correctly.\n Without research I would have never known that the 'six pack' had the\n\nmiddle carb sitting higher than the outside carbs, the window trim was\n\nchrome, Rally I wheels were stock not Rally II wheels ( Rally II wheels\n\nweren't on the car until 1967) and the car only had a driver side mirror on\n\nthe outside, not two.\n The kit would have me build an inaccurate model - - which is not\n\nacceptable to me. \n\n  To fix large inaccuracies you've got to scra 've build them or\n\nfind a company who makes accurate replacements / enhancements ( and there are\n\nmany companies who do this, so don't fear too much if you find yourself in\n\nthis spot) \n\n  First and foremost, the paint is a primary concern.\n Everything rests on the paint - - a bad paint job will overshadow any\n\nother aspect of a model because it is the most visible feature.\n In order to ensure that the paint comes out well good preparation\n\nmaterials are needed as well as just good preparation. \n\n  While at this point we do not need to apply paint it is important\n\nto have colors and vehicles in mind.\n If you're buildin 're kit and want to use factory colors then you'll 'll\nneed to pick out those colors.\n If you're lookin 'reo do a custom paint job then you'll 'llso need to\n\npick those out.\n Certain colors look better on certain cars while other can completely\n\nthrow off the project.\n For instance you'll 'llobably not want to paint a 1989 Savanna RX-7\n\nFC3S in Wimbledon White because it looks funny and because Wimbledon White is\n\na Ford color, not a Mazda color.\n You would however probably paint it Black, Red, Aluminum or White\n\nsince those were the factory colors that the car came in.\n You may even want to go totally custom and paint it something like\n\nMica Red fading to Mica Crimson with Metallic Black accents ( like lamp\n\ncovers, door guards and spoiler).\n Anyway you want to paint a model is fine as far as color goes but it\n\nis important to be aware that not all paint is the same - - in short paint is\n\nnot paint is not paint. \n\n  Lacquer is thinner than acrylic and enamel but is subject to\n\nchipping, fading , and is typically 'flat'.\n Lacquer dries very fast compared to enamel because the vehicle in the\n\npaint evaporates.\n The vehicle in lacquer also softens paint below it and chemically\n\nbonds to any pre-existing layers of paint.\n For this reason is it never a great idea to put lacquer over top of\n\nan enamel or acrylic.\n Lacquer will cost you more money in the long run to use because it\n\nrequires that you seal it to avoid chipping and fading, but sealing it\n\ndeepens the color and gives a much better finish.\n Cleaning lacquer up is harder because it needs stronger chemicals\n\nthat can attack the plastic of a model, so lacquers are good for masked spray\n\nwork and base coats.\n Tamiya paints are never enamels... they're with 'reSpray lacquer or\n\nbottled acrylics but are formulated to not react with other brands of enamel,\n\nacrylic and lacquers. \n\n  Enamel is fairly thick and unlike lacquer the drying process can\n\ntake upwards of 2-3 days.\n Technically enamel doesn't dry so much as it simply hardens with an\n\nouter shell forming within about an hour.\n Enamel doesn't soften the layer of paint below it but can be softened\n\nby lacquer - - therefore again I stress that it is a bad idea to put lacquer\n\nover enamel.\n The exception to this is clear coats.\n Enamel is typically semi-gloss ( egg shell or satin as it is\n\nsometimes referred) or gloss.\n The thickness of enamel coupled with the time reduced amount of time\n\nit takes for a shell to form over it makes enamel prone to 'orange peel' and\n\nif not careful quite possible to fill in panel lines on accident.\n The clean up however is fairly simple as the chemicals used need time\n\nto attack plastic.\n It 's also the easiest paint to strip off of a model when you're not 're\nhappy with the overall paint job.\n A couple of hours in degreaser and you'l 'llever know there was any\n\npaint on it at all!\n Testors makes all three varieties of paint and are really bad about\n\nreacting to certain brands of lacquer over their own brand of lacquer, though\n\nTamiya and Mr. Color work well with Testors brands of paint. \n\n  Acrylic paint is a double edged sword.\n It dries fast so it is best suited for detail work that isn't going\n\nto take long, but it is usually water soluble so the cleanup is simple while\n\nstill wet.\n Once dry however, acrylics are like enamel and chemicals are needed\n\nto remove them.\n Also like enamel, acrylics do not soften the layer of paint below\n\nthem.\n Acrylics are also very easy to dilute into 'inks', which in turn are\n\nused to detail panel lines with 'loaded brushes' so that the model has more\n\ndimension and realistic look.\n Acrylics are also almost always gloss and require a bit of stirring\n\nbecause they separate quickly.\n\n  Tamiya metallic acrylics require being stirred every 7-10 minutes\n\nand all of them require stirring ( or vigorous shaking) at every use but they\n\ngo down really well.\n Testors and Mr. Color acrylics don't need to be stirred as often as\n\nTamiya, but go down pretty thick which can cause brush strokes to be clearly\n\nvisible. TO summarize the concept of paint you should just simply remember\n\nthe order in which you want to put down your paint layers. \n\n  These are things to think about when you choose a model.\n Understanding in what order you'l 'lleed to apply colors saves a lot\n\nof work and frustration in the end.\n Above all, make sure that whatever brand of paint you use, that it is\n\nsafe on polystyrene.\n Polystyrene is only one kind of model plastic but it is the most\n\ncommon.\n Another common plastic is Polycarbon which is primarily used for RC\n\nbodies and parts.\n Polycarbon paint will attack ( 'eat' is probably more accurate)\n\npolystyrene as polystyrene is pretty much super condensed Styrofoam.\n Also, since lacquer and enamel have some form of urethane in them...\n\nbe smart about it and be in a well ventilated area ( like outside).\n\n\n  Preparing to build a model is more than just clearing table space\n\nand a model.\n There are basic things you' 'llneed in order to ensure that your model\n\ngets off to a good start. \n\n  Sandpaper is probably the most underrated material you' 'llneed.\n It 's used for removing 'pull lines' ( where the injector pills away\n\nfrom the mold), swirls, flashing, and sprue ( a sprue tree is what each piece\n\nis attached to prior to being cut away)connectors.\n Sandpaper is also used to finish paint jobs.\n Typically one would use 3600 to 12000 grit for removing and reducing 'orange\n\npeel' ( the tiny pits that appear in a spray paint job).", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0f9c6e7e-65dd-45f8-8095-8be7c1916f66", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.795551+00:00"}
{"text": ", AND STRATEGIES OF\n\nRESISTANCE\n\n  High technology networks make possible the deluge of texts\n\nsurrounding us.\n We swim in the flow of information, and are provided with ( or drowned\n\nwithin) interpretations and representations.\n High technology has changed the way capital functions, and makes\n\npossible the electronic format of this journal.\n A new relationship between bodies and technologies is, seemingly,\n\nunprecedented in modern capitalism.\n(1985),\n\nwrites of a post-natural present in which   \u001cLate twentieth-century\n\nmachines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and\n\nartificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many\n\nother distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines.\n Our machines are frighteningly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly\n\ninert\u001d ( 152).\n\n  After all, the human capacity to generate or make sense of\n\ninformation has been surpassed by computers, and challenged by the deluge of\n\ntexts ( literal, aural, visual) that surround us.\n Baudrillard 's response to this deluge is triggered by a quick spin\n\nof the radio dial:  \u001cI no longer succeed in knowing what I want, the\n\nspace is so saturated, the pressure so great from all who want to make\n\nthemselves heard\u001d ( 132).\n\n  Theorists from many disciplines are engaged in the process of\n\narticulating the function and effects of high technology; many have argued,\n\nas Baudrillard has, that the human condition has been transformed by the\n\nencounter with the unique and unprecedented power of high technology.\n Assuming a material uniqueness in the encounter with high technology\n\nis dangerous; this assumption obviates important precedents that may help us\n\nto strategize some resistance to a  \u001cgradual and willing accommodation\n\nof the machine\"  ( Gibson, 203).\n Freud 's clinical methods, and his construction of the relationship\n\nbetween patient and therapist, for example, are strikingly similar to the\n\ncurrent encounter between bodies and technologies.\n A look at Freud 's account of his treatment of Dora makes obvious\n\nthis decidedly low-tech version of a  \u001cdeluge of texts,\u001d and\n\nshows the way in which this therapeutic construct incorporated resistance.\n What are the possibilities for resistance to this new deluge?\n This question has provided the impetus for a vital, and absolutely\n\nnecessary, discussion of strategies.\n As I will show in this essay, these responses are symptomatic of the\n\nfailure of resistance to technologies of the early twentieth century.\n Strategies of resistance are often incorporated into systems,\n\nstrengthening that which is being resisted.\n Juliet Mitchell has described the function of this resisting space:\n\n  \u001c[Resistance] is set up precisely as its own ludic space, its own\n\narea of imaginary alternative, but not as a symbolic alternative.\n It is not that the carnival cannot be disruptive of the law, but it\n\ndisrupts only within terms of that law\u001d ( Mitchell, 1982).\n\n  I hope to provide some strategies, and historical warnings, that\n\nmay help one actualize and resist power at a time when the possibility of\n\ndoing so seems dismal.\n \u001cwe are\n\nnot dealing with technological determinism, but with a historical system\n\ndepending upon structured relations among people\u001d ( 165).\n includes the interaction\n\nbetween bodies and technologies and the implications of these encounters,\n\nwhich are referred to in this essay as  \u001ccyborg politics.\u001d\n The origin of cyborg politics doesn't begin with the late twentieth\n\ncentury, however, but with the broad tradition of positing scientific and\n\ntechnical solutions to free humans from pain and to solve problems of the\n\nhuman condition, particularly problems that originate not with the machine or\n\ntechnology, but within the body.\n Foucault has given us a description of the emergence of\n\nbio-technical power in the seventeenth century; his description of this power\n\nmaps onto our twentieth-century concern with bodies and technologies: \n\n\n Discipline may be identified neither with an institution nor with an\n\napparatus; it is a type of power, a modality for its exercise, comprising a\n\nwhole set of instruments, techniques, procedures, levels of application,\n\ntargets; it is a  \u001cphysics\u001d or an  \u001canatomy\" of power,\n\na technology.\n\n\n  Within an early twentieth-century Foucaultian formation, Freud\n\nemerges as the mental technologist and industrialist, producing the truth of\n\nmind and body within the critical tools of psychotherapy.\n Freud constructed a method whereby the mind, largely abandoned to\n\nthe world of religious therapies, was treated by empiricists, and built upon\n\nthe work of the psychiatrists of the French school: Charcot, Georget, and\n\nPinel ( Goldstein, 134-166).\n\n  Psychotherapy was a new disciplinary technology, unique unto\n\nscience because it treated the mind as a machine ( a method previously\n\nvisited upon the body).\n Freud ushered in the Western twentieth century with this\n\nindustrialist approach to the soul, fracturing the inner self in two: \n\n\u001cconscious\u001d and  \u001cunconscious\u001d drives.\n Within this new science, and in Freud 's clinical approach, the\n\nCartesian dualism of mind/body breaks down:  \u001cmind\u001d has been\n\ndivided into conscious/unconscious.\n is no longer one unitary term\n\nthat can correspond to its binary opposite,  \u001cbody.\u001d This\n\ndisruption could be promising: mind/body corresponded to male/female, and it\n\nwould seem that this pair of binary oppositions would no longer be able to\n\nfunction with respect to gender.\n Yet this deconstruction of oppositional pairs serves to strengthen\n\nothers, and raises some thorny questions for Freud 's treatment of Dora.\n\n  What, then, becomes of the relationship between mind and body\n\nwithin the Freudian construct?\n\n\n\u001cmind\u001d has been fractured into two distinct entities, how does this\n\naffect clinical practice?\n Freud changed these pairs or, at the least, expanded the way they\n\nfunction: the patient 's experiences, as described by the patient, were\n\ninformed by the unconscious mind in a way that was not evident to the\n\npatient.\n In deconstructing the mind/body separation, Freud constructed a new\n\noppositional pair in its place, that of the conscious/unconscious.\n The relations between the conscious mind and body were obvious to\n\nthe patient, but those were less important for fixing the machine than was\n\nthe relationship between the unconscious mind and body.\n If this relationship was the arbiter of the body 's functions and of\n\nthe conscious mind, how could one go about fixing it?\n One couldn't; a therapist had to be called in for repair. The\n\n \u001cunconscious\u001d drives were given over to the interpretation of\n\nthe therapist.\n In treating the machinery of the mind, Freudian therapists were\n\ngiven the interpretive duty of constructing desire and representing the inner\n\nself. Philip Reiff, in his introduction to  Dora, captures the\n\nperfect circularity of Freudian psychotherapy as enacted in clinical\n\npractice:\n\n  \n By presuming the patient incapable of an impartial judgment, the\n\ntherapist is empowered to disregard the patient 's denials....\n \u001cYou may think I meant to say something\n\ninsulting but I've no such intention....\n< 've-USA:#X45:1> From this the analyst may conclude,  \u001cSo, she does mean to\n\nsay something insulting....\u001d  ( 15)\n\n  It is also evident in Reiff 's description that resistance\n\nagainst a therapist is incorporated, and neutralized, within therapy.\n The Freudian therapeutic situation is a cybernetic network in which\n\nresistance functions to support the system.\n It is in this clinical practice that any potential disruption of\n\ndualisms promised in Freudian theory were recuperated.\n That Freud has constructed an impenetrable defense for the therapist\n\nis obvious.\n In retrospect, it 's easy ( albeit reductive) to view Freud 's\n\nincorporation of resistance into therapies ( as a prerequisite for therapy)\n\nas a frustrated empiricist 's attempt to fit the mind into the structure of\n\nempiricism.\n\n  The patient/therapist opposition was constructed in place of the\n\nmind/body opposition, and re-enacted as male/female.\n Perhaps Freud 's construction of an impenetrable position for\n\ntherapists, and an utterly penetrated position for patients, created a\n\nbacklash against the material moment when male/female became disengaged from\n\nmind/body.\n At any rate, the context is utterly changed for a patient of\n\npsychotherapy.\n The beginnings of an answer to the question of gender difference in\n\nthe therapist/patient relationship lie in asking the following question: Who\n\nis treated and why?\n \u001cpenetrated\"side of the\n\ntherapist/patient relationship.\n Although male/female no longer enacted mind/body, another structure\n\nexcluded men from needing this interpretive therapy: the impetus for\n\ntreatment is resistance on the part of the patient.\n Philip Reiff characterized the category of patient in his\n\nintroduction to  Dora when he wrote that,  \u001cthe neurotic\n\nmakes too many rejections\u001d ( 16).\n\n  Although men were no longer excluded from the category of\n\npatient, having unconscious drives themselves, the prerequisite for treatment\n\nwas often hysteria or neurosis.\n Hysteria was a term used to categorize actions seen, historically,\n\nas being particular to women, although Freud and the Paris school 's\n\ncharacterization of hysteria did not expressly exclude men.\n Jan Goldstein has documented that hysteria was flirted with by most\n\nof the nineteenth-century French male novelists, and she argues that the\n\nliterary interest in such a disease  \u001cincluded as one of its\n\ncomponents a fascination with this 'otherness,' a tendency to recognize in it\n\naspects of the self and to enlist it in the service of\n\nself-discovery\u001d ( 138).\n Goldstein 's theory would also explain why Flaubert never entered\n\ninto therapy, despite identifying himself as an hysteric.\n In his fiction, Flaubert wrote of hysteria only through female\n\ncharacters, as did all the other French novelists mentioned in Goldstein 's\n\nessay.\n\n  Dora 's treatment, after all, was not in the interest of\n\nself-discovery, but in the interest of her father.\n Dora had been brought to Freud in an effort to get Dora to accept\n\nher father 's affair with Frau K.\n The father also needed Dora to respond to Herr K so that he could\n\nget his game of partner-swapping to continue to go smoothly: he attempts to\n\nswap  \u001cpartners\u001d with Herr K by offering his daughter, Dora,\n\nto Herr K, in exchange for Herr K 's wife.\n This play of substitutions, begun by the father, certainly asks to\n\nbe seen as a machine.\n This is a desiring machine in which substitutions can be made: there\n\nare slots to be filled ( so to speak) that eclipse an individual desire to be\n\nin that position.\n This is particularly true in Dora 's case.\n \u001c[s]he\n\nobjected to being pulled into the game entirely, at the same time she was\n\nfascinated by it and wanted to play\u001d ( 34).\n By the time treatment had begun, Dora was suicidal, and had been\n\nresisting Herr K. 's advances, the first of which occurred when she was 14\n\nyears old.  \n \" He suddenly clasped the girl to him and pressed a kiss upon her\n\nlips.\n This was surely just the situation to call up a distinct feeling of\n\nsexual excitement in a girl of fourteen who had never before been approached.\n But Dora had at that moment a violent feeling of disgust and tore\n\nherself free from the man ...\" ( 43).\n\n  \u001cthe behavior of this child of\n\nfourteen was already entirely and completely hysterical\"  because she\n\ndid not have the  \u001cgenital sensation which would have certainly been\n\nfelt by a healthy girl in such circumstances\u001d ( 44).\n Dora 's resistance to Herr K. 's advances provided Freud with the\n\ncornerstone of the psychology of the neuroses: reversal of affect.\n Without Dora 's bodily resistance to Herr K., Freud would never have\n\nbeen able to treat her in the first place.\n Without Dora 's repeated verbal resistance to Freud 's suppositions,\n\nhe couldn't have written in the  \u001crepressed\u001d desires for\n\nnearly everyone in the  \u001cgame.\"\n\n \n\nMemoirs of My Nervous Illness, Freud didn't perceive any indications\n\nthat this approach could inhibit treatment by negating the patient 's\n\ninterpretations. Freud 's textual analysis of the  Memoirs, titled\n\n \u001cPsychoanalytic Notes on an Autobiographical Account of a Case of\n\nParanoia ( Dementia Paranoides)\", ignores the obvious: Schreber is\n\nable to treat himself via his own process of writing and interpretation.\n\n  toward\n\nProfessor Fleschig, his doctor, for helping Scheber to recover, but in a\n\nmanner  \u001cso hedged with doubts and reservations that it subverts the\n\nexpressed appreciation\u001d ( Chabot, 16).\n Schreber doesn't give credit for his recovery to the doctor who was\n\nin charge of his treatment, and blames this on the doctor 's inability to\n\nrecognize his patient as  \u001ca human being of high intellect, of\n\nuncommon keenness of understanding and acute powers of observation\u001d (\n\n Memoirs, 62).\n What does this tell us about Freud 's understanding of Schreber 's\n\ntreatment?\n Freud didn't extrapolate Schreber 's therapeutic process to his own\n\nclinical method; he ignores that Schreber 's experience points to the healing\n\npower of a patient 's interpretation.\n The patient 's story, moreover, must not be systematically negated,\n\nas in the treatment of Dora.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "488c2c45-3b94-45a0-b1b4-0f41c7edd9d5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.796729+00:00"}

Eastland traces some problems of the modern presidency to\n\nWilsonian grandiosity in the conception of the president 's duties.\n Wilson, writes Eastland, was the first holder of the office to\n\nbelieve \" that Presidents are to lead the people ever onwards and upwards -\n\nto an unknown destination only history can reveal, but which, as the decades\n\nhave passed, inevitably seems to have required larger and more costly\n\ngovernment whose reach extends more deeply into the states and the private\n\nsector.\"\n \" the size of modern democracy\n\nnecessitates the exercise of persuasive power by dominant minds in the\n\nshaping of popular judgments.\"\n Thus began the inflation of the presidential function: The president\n\nas the public 's tutor, moral auditor and cheerleader \n\n \n\n\n  Clinton, who will be the sixth Democratic president since Woodrow\n\nWilson, leads a party still awash with Wilsonian liberalism 's desire to\n\nconscript the individual into collective undertakings.\n Wilson presided over the 'war socialism' of modern mobilization.\n Walter Lippmann and other 'progressives' thought war could be a\n\nhealthy antidote to America 's excessive 'individualism' and \" the evils of\n\nlocalism.\"\n The public, properly led by a \" dominant mind\" at the pinnacle of the\n\nexecutive branch of the central government, could be nationalized and\n\nhomogenized and made into good raw material for great undertakings.\n The greatest of these was to be what Peter Drucker calls \" salvation\n\nby society\" - society, controlled by government, would perfect individuals.\n Hence, Lyndon Johnson.\n One of his aides, Harry McPherson, described how LBJ envisioned the\n\nnation as a patient whose pathologies were to receive presidential\n\nministrations: \" People were [ seen to be] suffering from a sense of\n\nalienation from one another, of anomie, of powerlessness.\n This affected the well-to-do as much as it did the poor.\n Middle-class women, bored and friendless in the suburban afternoons;\n\nfathers, working at 'meaningless' j 'ms, or slumped before the television set;\n\nsons and daughters desperate for 'relevance' 'rell were in need of community,\n\nbeauty, and purpose, all were guilty because so many others were deprived\n\nwhile they, rich beyond their ancestors' dreams, were depressed.\n What would change all this was a creative public effort ...\"\n It is a wonder we did not wind up with a Department of Meaningful\n\nLabor and an Agency for Friendly Suburban Afternoons.\n LBJ promised a Great Society \" where the city of man serves not only\n\nthe needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty\n\nand the hunger for community.\"\n Today Americans would settle for cities where the basic needs of the\n\nbody ( such as protection from bullets) and the rudimentary requirements of\n\ncommerce ( order; adequate education and transportation) are provided \n\n  Clinton 's eager beavers should ponder that, perhaps during a\n\nherky-jerky drive down Florida Street \n\n\n  The bitter trade dispute reveals isolationism is growing on both\n\nsides of the Atlantic Robert J. Samuelson We call the Europeans our 'allies'.\n This reference is an increasingly outdated relic of the cold war.\n The bitter trade dispute now raging between America and Europe merely\n\ncaptures a larger reality: Western Europe is so self-absorbed that it 's\n\naggravating the conflicts of the post-cold-war world.\n An alliance presumes common goals.\n In practice, Europe gives only lip service to the common goals we\n\nsupposedly share \n\n  Ever since World War II, Americans have correctly favored greater\n\nEuropean unity.\n The Common Market spurred economic recovery and helped subdue the\n\nhatreds of two world wars.\n But the latest exercise in unity - embodied in the 1991 Maastricht\n\nTreaty - no longer deserves our admiration or support.\n It aims to create a single European currency by 1999 and to remake\n\nthe European Community ( EC) into something of a superstate.\n These foolish ambitions are bad for Europe, bad for the United States\n\nand bad for the world.\n They inhibit Europe from playing a constructive role in international\n\naffairs \n\n  Everyone knows the basic problems of the post-cold-war era.\n The first is to help Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union\n\nestablish prosperous and democratic societies.\n The second is to nurture cooperative mechanisms that enable countries\n\nto maintain peace, healthy world trade and a cleaner environment.\n And the third is to foster strong global economic growth.\n\n\n  It has been unimaginative and stingy in dealing with the former\n\nSoviet Union and Eastern Europe.\n It has been totally ineffectual in Yugoslavia.\n Its heavy farm subsidies threaten the global trading order: precisely\n\nthe type of cooperative framework that 's now needed.\n As for the economy, Europe 's slump is self-inflicted and is hurting\n\nthe rest of the world.\n The slowdown resulted from poor economic policies - rigid European\n\nexchange rates and high interest rates - adopted to cope with German\n\nreunification \n\n  Europe aspires to join the United States as a superpower.\n The trouble is, Europe provides no practical or moral leadership.\n Building a more grandiose Europe serves as an all-purpose excuse to\n\nshirk global responsibilities.\n\n\n  Consider the current trade dispute.\n In 1962 the EC eliminated its tariff on soybeans.\n As soybean imports rose, the EC sought to stem the tide by massively\n\nsubsidizing its own farmers to grow competing oilseeds: sunflower seeds and\n\nrapeseed.\n Europe 's oilseed production jumped from 1.5 million metric tons in\n\n1976 to 11.7 million in 1991.\n Meanwhile, its imports of oilseeds ( mainly from the United States)\n\ndropped from 7.6 million tons to 6.3 million tons over the same period.\n In effect, the EC 's subsidies revoked the 1962 tariff concession.\n That violates the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n\nGATT) \n\n  In 1989 Washington complained to GATT.\n The GATT twice ruled in our favor.\n The Europeans refused to remedy their violation.\n Only after long negotiations did we retaliate: 200 percent tariffs to\n\nbe imposed on\n\n&dollar;300 million worth of European food imports ( mainly wine) in December \n\n  Global leadership requires the capacity to identify larger\n\ninternational interests - consistent, to be sure, with a nation 's own\n\ninterests - and pursue them, even at some immediate domestic political cost.\n This has been the hallmark of postwar U.S. leadership.\n We helped Europe and Japan rebuild after World War II, kept a strong\n\nmilitary and maintained relatively open trade policies.\n\n\n  Irrelevant goals: On trade, perhaps the worst calamity - a\n\nbreakdown of GATT - will be avoided.\n By threatening Europe with real penalties, the tough U.S. retaliation\n\nmay prompt a settlement of the soybean dispute and the broader GATT talks.\n Even if this occurs, though, Europe seems fated to remain\n\nself-absorbed by the impractical and irrelevant goals of the Maastricht\n\nTreaty \n\n  Take a common European currency, which would replace national\n\nones, like the French franc.\n In the United States, a single currency works because, among other\n\nreasons, people migrate from a region of economic weakness to one of\n\nstrength.\n Europe, divided by language and culture, lacks our flexibility.\n It 's hard to create an economic policy that suits all countries.\n\n\n  Even if a common currency could work, it is irrelevant to\n\nEurope 's immediate needs.\n If Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union slide into chaos, it\n\nwon't matter whether or not Western Europe has a common currency.\n The economic and social effects of this anarchy - unwanted\n\nimmigration, perhaps more strife as in Yugoslavia - will be overwhelming.\n But Western Europe focuses on Maastricht instead of the more\n\ncritical problems in the East \n\n  Europe cannot be made into a nation: it is a permanent cluster\n\nof nationalities.\n The unrealistic effort to do so is increasingly unpopular.\n The Danes rejected Maastricht, the French approved it by 2\n\npercentage points.\n People fear being submerged by a faceless EC bureaucracy.\n To overcome hostility, Europe 's leaders pander to local interests.\n They are insensitive to outsiders, including us.\n Farm policy is one area where we' 'vesuffered; Airbus - Europe 's\n\nsubsidized commercial jet maker - is another \n\n  What Europe should do, as columnist William Pfaff writes in the\n\nInternational Herald Tribune, is follow its \" past model of progress through\n\npragmatic economic integration.\"\n Specifically, it should bring Eastern countries into its market as\n\nquickly as possible \n\n  The Persian Gulf crisis showed that Europe needs us.\n But we also need Europe as a superpower.\n All nations are looking inward, perhaps ( as after World War I)\n\ndangerously so.\n Americans won't make the sacrifices for global leadership unless\n\nother rich nations do likewise.\n Unfortunately, the Europeans won't play.\n They merely want to advance their own agenda.\n Their isolationism feeds ours.\n\n\n  This Economy Won't Walk Yup.\n But it may not be quite as crippled as you 've been led to believe", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "51d8cf07-797b-4dc6-965d-e4ebbfa177b4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.798053+00:00"}

{"text": "\" The time has come to consider creating a global system for\n\nprotection of the world community,\" Boris Yeltsin said on January 31,\n\naddressing President Bush and the United Nations Security Council.\n \" It could be based on a reorientation of the U.S. Strategic Defense\n\nInitiative to make use of high technologies developed in Russia 's defense\n\ncomplex.\"\n Yeltsin 's proposal is a hot deal for the former enemies: Russia gets\n\ncash, the United States, nuclear technology - and power through the\n\nmilitarization of space.\n\n\n  A deal to buy Russia 's Topaz 2 space reactor was struck more than\n\na year ago and announced in January 1991 at the eighth annual Symposium on\n\nSpace Nuclear Power Systems in New Mexico.\n Nikolai Ponomarev-Stepnoi, first deputy of the Kurtchatovis Institute\n\nof Atomic Power in Moscow, explained at the time, \" Our institution got its\n\nbudget cut 50 percent and ... we need to look for finances from different\n\nsources.\"\n As for the cost to the United States, Richard Verga, director of key\n\ntechnologies for the Pentagon 's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization,\n\nsaid that Topaz 2 would be used in a program with an overall cost of\n\n&dollar;100 million.\n The Topaz, a reactor that produces energy through nuclear fission as\n\nit orbits the Earth, uses a \" thermionic\" design - technology in which Russia\n\noutstrips the United States.\n It could be mass-produced here to provide power to weaponry on Star\n\nWars battle platforms. \n\n  The Topaz 2 deal poses stiff competition to General Electric,\n\nwhich is developing a Star Wars nuclear reactor of its own, the SP-100, and\n\nis causing a split among U.S. policy-makers.\n In a January 6 memo the White House Office of Management and Budget\n\nordered the Energy Department and NASA to give preference to the Topaz 2\n\nbecause \" the potential availability of the Topaz 2 ... offers new\n\npossibilities,\" and it cut D.O.E. 's SP-100 budget for 1993 from\n\n&dollar;40 million to\n\n&dollar;30 million.\n The Pentagon also favors the Topaz, claiming it can be deployed in\n\nthree years at a tenth the cost of the SP-100, which has a price tag of\n\n&dollar;1.6 billion and can't be tested until 2004.\n But D.O.E., longtime friend to G.E., insists SP-100 's liquid metal\n\nheat system is \" ahead of thermionics.\" \n\n  This past January the Russians were back with more deals - and\n\nsome veiled threats of selling to Libya - at the ninth annual Symposium on\n\nSpace Nuclear Power Systems.\n This time they were peddling their nuclear-powered rockets.\n Coincidentally, the Pentagon had just disclosed some of its own plans\n\nfor nuclear-powered rockets.\n Scrubbed in 1972 after seventeen years of development as too\n\ndangerous and too costly ( at\n\n&dollar;1.5 billion already spent -\n\n&dollar;6.5 billion in today 's dollars), the project was covertly reopened for Star\n\nWars in 1987, code-named Timberwind and kept in deep secrecy.\n Nuclear-powered rockets, with a stronger blast force than\n\nconventional ones, would theoretically be able to loft the massive lasers,\n\nparticle-beam devices and other heavy Star Wars weaponry into orbit.\n Air Force spokesmen admitted to a cost of\n\n&dollar;800 million for the project.\n The designer and manufacturer of the U.S. nuclear-powered rocket\n\nengine is Babcock and Wilcox, of Three Mile Island fame. \n\n  Lost in the scramble for dollars and technology is careful\n\nconsideration of what the nuclearization of space can cost the planet - in\n\ndollars and in lives.\n In dollars: The Star Wars budget jumped from\n\n&dollar;2.9 billion in 1991 to\n\n&dollar;4.1 billion this year.\n The White House in calling for a record 1993 Star Wars budget of\n\n&dollar;5.4 billion. \n\n  In danger: There has been a 15 percent failure rate in both U.S.\n\nand Soviet nuclear space hardware.\n The most serious U.S. accident occurred in 1964, when a\n\nplutonium-powered satellite fell toward Earth, breaking up i the atmosphere\n\nand showering plutonium over vast areas of the planet.\n Russian nuclear-powered satellites have also fallen to Earth.\n The 1978 crash of Cosmos 954 covered a broad swath of Canada with\n\nradioactive debris.\n Topaz or SP-100, Timberwind or Russian rocketry, they're Chernobyls\n\n'rein the sky. \n\n  Government documents on Timberwind told of a prototype of the\n\nnuclear rocket failing on the ground.\n Still, the Pentagon planned a test flight, which for \" safety\"\n\nreasons would take place mostly over water around Antarctica, though New\n\nZealand is on its path.\n A government analysis put the chances of the nuclear rocket crashing\n\ninto New Zealand at 1 in 2,325.\n ( For some perspective on these odds, recall that the chances of a\n\nChallenger-type disaster were estimated at 1 in 100,000.) The Topaz 2 has\n\nbeen used in only two missions, in 1987.\n\n\n  This past July, insuring against accidents with U.S. nuclear\n\nspace machinery, NASA and D.O.E. signed a Space Nuclear Power Agreement\n\nlimiting U.S. liability in the event of a nuclear accident in space to\n\n&dollar;7.3 billion to Americans for property damage or death from radioactive\n\ncontamination and\n\n&dollar;100 million, total, for citizens of all other nations.\n Five months earlier, the United States withdrew support for U.N.\n\ndraft guidelines on the use of nuclear space devices because the Defense\n\nDepartment and NASA feared that Star Wars might be hindered by such a treaty.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \" I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste\n\nin the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that.\n The publication of these words, from a leaked internal memo, caused a\n\nrush of bad publicity for their author, World Bank chief economist Lawrence\n\nSummers, who now claims he was being ironic and provocative.\n There were calls for his resignation.\n But Summers was expressing honestly the logic of his discipline and\n\nhis employer. \n\n  Summers - whose salary is 225 times the per-person income of the\n\nbank 's Third World clientele - is a whiz-bang Harvard econocrat, a class that\n\nbelieves religiously that money is the final measure of value.\n Happiness is a growing G.D.P.\n Legal issues can be resolved as competing economic claims, and\n\nethical decisions can be translated into dollar terms, with the cheaper\n\nalternative always preferable. \n\n  In his memo, which criticized a draft of the bank 's World\n\nDevelopment Report, Summers was applying cost-benefit analysis, which\n\nmeasures the value of a human life by the stream of wages remaining to it.\n Say it will cost Global Megatoxics\n\n&dollar;1 million to install a state-of-the-art scrubber in its chimney.\n If Global determines that not spending this sum will shorten the\n\nlives of five people by ten years apiece, all that would be lost would be the\n\npresent value of these fifty years of wages.\n At a wage of\n\n&dollar;1,000 a year, the cost of the five lives can be figured at\n\n&dollar;41,000, thanks to the magic of compound interest; at\n\n&dollar;30,000 a year, they're worth\n\n'reollar;1.2 million.\n As Summers said in his memo, \" health-impairing pollution should be\n\ndone in the country with the lowest cost, which will be the country with the\n\nlowest wages.\"\n Since the costs of pollution - always priced in dollars or their\n\nequivalent - rise with development, Summers argued, it makes sense costwise\n\nto dump in Africa.\n If a pollutant is going to cause \" prostrate\" cancer, a disease of\n\nold age, why not locate it in countries where people aren't likely to live\n\nlong enough to get it?\n He concluded this section by saying that disagreement with this logic\n\nsuggests the belief that things like \" intrinsic rights to certain goods,\n\nmoral reasons, social concerns, lack of adequate markets, etc.\n could be turned around and used more or less effectively against\n\nevery Bank proposal for liberalization.?\n\n\n  It makes no sense for Summers to resign; he expressed the bank 's\n\nlogic perfectly.\n It 's a bank, and acts like one.\n It may preside over a steady erosion of Third World incomes relative\n\nto First World ones, but it makes big money.\n Last year, after paying\n\n&dollar;7 billion in interest and fees to its investors and bankers, it had a\n\n&dollar;1.2 billion surplus and a rate of return that commercial banks would envy.\n\n\n\n  What 's a public institution to do with that kind of surplus?\n The bank 's executive board spends a lot of time working that question\n\nover.\n In 1991 it decided to contribute\n\n&dollar;267 million to its soft-loan affiliate, which lends to very poor countries\n\nat concessional rates,\n\n&dollar;29 million to the Global Environment Trust Fund and stuff the remaining\n\n&dollar;904 million into its hoard of 'retaine 'rearnings,' which now stands at\n\n&dollar;11.9 billion.\n According to Unicef, preventing vitamin-A-deficiency blindness would\n\ncost\n\n&dollar;6 million.\n Preventing \" the great majority\" of childhood malnutrition deaths\n\nwould cost\n\n&dollar;2.5 billion.\n\n\n  In recent years, the bank has moved away from project-oriented\n\nlending - power plants and dams - and toward structural adjustment lending,\n\nin which credit is conditional on adoption of a standard\n\nausterity/deregulation package.\n Not surprisingly, these schemes have savage effects, to which the\n\nbank has a ready answer - more loans.\n The bank is lending its clients more money to treat the poverty,\n\nsocial dislocation and environmental damage that earlier loans helped create.\n The bank funds greenhouse-gas reduction schemes in countries where\n\nthe greenhouse-gas producers were initially financed by the World Bank. \n\n  Bank publicity makes much of a new environmental consciousness,\n\nbut actions tell a different story.\n The bank exempted structural adjustment programs from environmental\n\nreview even though their point is to work human and physical resources harder\n\nwhich can't be friendly to people or their environment.\n It has redlined its environment department, leaving it little power.\n World Bank claims to a larger role in global environmental politics -\n\nto be pressed, for example, at this spring 's United Nations Conference on the\n\nEnvironment and Development - should be beaten back with heavy sticks. \n\n  Whether or not Summers returns to Harvard, waste export will be a\n\ngrowth industry for these sluggish times.\n The practice of shifting dirty industries to poor countries is well\n\nestablished.\n Greenpeace follows the routine stuff all over the world - German (\n\nper capita income:\n\n&dollar;20,440) plastic to Argentina (\n\n&dollar;2,160), U.S. (\n\n&dollar;20,910) mercury to South Africa (\n\n&dollar;2,470), car batteries from everywhere to Brazil (\n\n&dollar;2,540).  Plastic dropped into recycling bins is likely to be shipped\n\nto Malaysia (\n\n&dollar;2,160). \n\n\n\n  The F.D.A. hearings into the safety of silicone gel breast\n\nimplants have ended with a split recommendation by the advisory panel:\n\nRejecting an out-right ban on the devices, it urges that implantees be\n\nregistered in clinical trials, to which only women who needed the surgery for\n\nreconstructive, not cosmetic, purposes would be guaranteed admittance.\n Which is it - \" Panel Backs Marketing of implants\" ( The Washington\n\nPost) or \" Experts Suggest U.S. Sharply Limit Breast Implants\" ( The New York\n\nTimes)\"\n\n\n  Whatever else they were, the hearings were great theater.\n There was the perfidy of Dow ( Napalm? Agent Orange? What 's that?)\n\nCorning, the largest manufacturer of the implants, which was revealed to have\n\nlied and stonewalled for almost thirty years.\n There was the pious greed of plastic surgeons, who aggressively\n\nmarketed the devices as a \" cure\" for \" micromastia\" small breasts, to you)\n\nand now warn of an epidemic of \" hysteria\" in breast-enlarged women newly\n\nenlightened about the risks of autoimmune disorders, painful scarring,\n\nobscured mammograms.\n There was a hero, too, if a few decades late - David Kessler, the\n\nF.D.A. 's energetic new head.\n But most of all there were breasts - sex, beauty, fashion, women,\n\nwomen 's bodies.\n Does anyone think the implant story would have been plastered all\n\nover the news media if it was about orthopedic shoes?\n The real breast-implant story, though, isn't about women 's bodies;\n\nit 's about their minds.\n In the postfeminist wonderland in which we are constantly being told\n\nwe live, women 's lives are portrayed as one big smorgasbord of \" choices\" and\n\n\" options\", all value free and freely made, and which therefore cannot be\n\nchallenged or even discussed, lest one sound patronizing or moralistic.\n Thus, women \" choose\" to have implants, we are told, to please men -\n\nno, wait, to boost their self-esteem - and who are you to criticize their\n\njudgment?", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "118bbcbe-3d0b-466a-962d-865f5ebf5a8d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.800934+00:00"}
{"text": "I finally seem to have found a Sunday afternoon when I can tackle\n\nletter writing.\n Your letter is one I've had difficulty returning to 'vecause I've been\n\nfraught with anxiet 'veround my academic plans, many of which aren't at the\n\nlevel where I can even articulate them, Whenever I do go through a period of\n\navid letter writing I know I am in a state of relative emotional stability,\n\nwhich I seem to have momentarily achieved.\n\n  Your letter made me realize the issues at stake when you choose a\n\nsupervisor - and here that 's really what you're chosing, not so much 'rechool\n\nas a supervisor.\n The fact that I was not able to form a very coherent research proposal\n\nmade the choice very difficult-and then I found that I was much more\n\npersuaded by finances than I had expected.\n Basically, there 's no funding available for me until I've lived In the\n\nUK for t 'vee years ( that 's how the British Academy works) so I'm faced with\n\nworking my wa 'mthrough.\n That pretty much threw out all my choices outside of London Sussex and\n\nEssex, probably my two strongest places.\n That left me with the choice between Birkbeck and Queen Mary, and I've\n\npretty much chosen B 'vebeck.\n Birkbeck caters to \" mature\" students ( I can't believe that 's me now!\n ) and my supervisor at the moment ( the Browning editor man) is very\n\nsympathethic and said I don't have to start paying fees until I have the\n\nmoney, I can just go to all the seminars and work with him without\n\nregistering.\n So I really couldn't turn that down!\n ( I've had a very disappointi 'verevelation about US Student\n\nLoans...the...the Republicans made the rules about deferring more difficult,\n\nand for all kinds of complicated reasons to do with not being able to enroll\n\nfull-time, and being outside the US, I can't fully defer my loans.)\n Also, I interviewed at Queen Mary and was not impressed at all with\n\nOphelia Clarke... there are some good people there, but Queen Mary has the\n\nworst academic reputation of all the Univ. of London colleges, and the\n\ndepartment is very weak in my proposed area of Victorian Poetry.\n The department at Birkbeck is very exciting, they have very strong\n\npeople in theory (  Tim High, we used a book by him in  Sadro\n\nDangelo 's Renaissance seminar, he is a New Historicist, I attended two of\n\nhis postgraduate theory seminars and they were excellent),  Sakai\n\nTakaki, who writes on theory, there are good interdisciplinary ties with\n\nwomen 's studies and art history ( there 's a big Pre-Raphaelite woman in the\n\nart history department, and they jointly put out the new Pre-Raphaelite\n\njournal.\n.\n She 's a big feminist over here, she edits \" Women, A Cultural Review\"\n\nout of Oxford, and she just wrote \" Victorian Poetry\" with Routledge.\n She is what got me excited about Browning.\n She is on sabbatical next year and is oversubscribed with phd\n\nstudents, but bascially my goal is to work with her.\n, says I should be\n\nable to work with her to some degree whatever happens.\n I can't really figure Roger out... he seems very conservative, but\n\nthen quite open-minded, he actually suggested that rather than do RB and D.\n\nRossetti, I extend my study to a foursome and include Elizabeth Barrett and\n\nChristina, and when I asked about feminist theory he said that such a study\n\nwould necessitate that I use feminist theory.\n To be honest, he seems nice but a bit strange.\n The sort of person that hasn't done terribly well in his academic\n\ncareer, hasn't published much, but is friends with people like  Liga\n\nBue; he 's about 50-60, lives in Cambridge and makes the long commute, and\n\nmentioned with obvious excitement his annual summer holiday, walking in the\n\nLake District with his mother.\n His office is emaculate, with few books, a tasteful green rug, and\n\ntwo wicker chairs separated by a comforatable distance, with a little wooden\n\ntable next to his chair on which he can place the work of the student with\n\nwhom he is meeting.\n He seems very committed to his students, and very thoughtful about\n\nwhat his role as a supervisor is.\n He is not, however, an exciting, dynamic person.\n Ellie\n\nMayer after a year.\n theory seminars - she was\n\nabsolutely wonderful.\n One on Derrida and one on Kristeva.\n In my opinion, she is one of those people who is not only a brilliant\n\nwriter but a brilliant teacher.\n She is very skillful and diplomatic in her approach.\n In the beginning of the session she would ask everyone to contribute\n\na question or problem from the reading, which seemed to work very well.\n\n\n  For the past seven months I have been working full time as a\n\nPersonal Assistant with Amnesty International, and that has not allowed me to\n\ndo much academic work.\n I am just starting to look for a part-time job to start in October,\n\nand I really want to find something better than secretarial, since I find\n\nthat each secretarial job I have chips away at my self-esteem a little bit\n\nmore.\n I am also concerned to develop a second career possibility since the\n\nchances of landing an academic job are so poor.\n I am going to try to find something in publishing since I have bit of\n\nexperience there, but I am not terribly optimistic.\n I am very aware of getting older and how difficult it is to find work\n\nif you haven't been in a career path.\n George keeps saying to me I could alway qualify as a solicitor, but I\n\ndon't know if I would have it in me to complete another long training after\n\ndoing a phd.\n How on earth do people get sucked in to academics!\n\n\n  I feel very out of what 's happening so if you can suggest any new\n\nbooks/articles out I'd be grat 'dul.\n I've enclosed a cl 'veing for a book that reminds me of the book you\n\nwere working on last year.\n I am of course hoping to hear positive news about your tenure\n\ndecision.\n\n  George has bought a flat, so we'll be movi 'llin September.\n Its nothing spectacular but is quite a step up from our current\n\nbedsit, it will allow us to put up visitors, so if you and Jack are making\n\nyour way to London you are certainly welcome to stay with us.\n\n\n  P.s.\n Roger was also very enthusiastic about my Hair paper!\n Evidently you mentioned it in your reference and he asked me about it\n\nin my interview, and now he keeps bringing it up as a possible dissertation\n\ntopic!\n I am horrified by the thought of spending three years entangled with\n\nHair in Victorian Poetry, but you never know...\n\n  Last I heard from Liz Welsh she was close to having a terme-teach\n\njob teaching composition/ESL at a college in California.\n\n\n\n\n\n  If you're still in 'reested in ethnomusicology though, this is the\n\nwrong place to come.\n Ken switching to Folklore as his PhD major because the ethno-faculty\n\nis not real receptive to his studying American country music & pop music.\n Also, the ethno. Dept. is kind of like the Russian dept. was at\n\nOberlin-- still has a good reputation, but the faculty is dwindling.\n So UCLA is the place to go for ethnomusicology, if you're still at 're\nall interested.\n I keep toying with getting still another master 's degree, since I'm\n\nhere at 'm university and all, but in other ways I'll be gla 'llo work again.\n It 's nice to have a little money, and I actually enjoyed working when\n\nI was at the Newberry of course, that could have been place-specific I guess.\n\n\n\n  By the way, I never got your card, so maybe it 's still somewhere\n\nin your apartment.\n So how come you moved?\n Did you get sick of living in Dorchester?\n\n\n  Unfortunatley, I know a lot of people who are getting or got\n\nmarried, although I guess the only person from Oberlin is Steeeeeeve.\n I almost got to see him this summer when he & his wife were traveling\n\ncross-country, taking a car his grandfather gave him from Maryland to San\n\nDiego, where they're liv 're.\n He 's planning to go to med school.\n He applied to many last year but didn't get in anywhere.\n He said it 's because he told the interviewers that he didn't have a\n\nlife-long dream to become a doctor.\n\n\n  Well, thank you again for writing and for the addition to my\n\narmadillo collection.\n I hope you can make the wedding.\n Give some thought to playing piano and let me know.\n Glad to hear you like your apartment, even though you seem to want to\n\nmake some changes in the other parts of your life.\n Take care!\n\n\n\n\n\n  Here is the music & recording we promised you.\n The tempo on the recording is altered to be at the speed we think\n\nwill be best for walking in and out.\n The arrangement of Hopak on the tape is different from the score, but\n\nit will at least give you an idea.\n Each piece lasts about 2 minutes with the slower tempo-- we may end\n\nup needing more time, so probably you will have to repeat parts of the\n\npieces.\n Anyway, hope these pieces are do-able for you.\n Let us know if there 's any problem, and thanks again for your\n\nwillingness to give this a try!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  P.P.S.

{"text": "Lucid dreaming is being aware of the fact that you are dreaming.\n This awareness can range from very faint recognition of the fact (\n\nwhich is often too brief and nebulous to be considered truly lucid) to\n\nsomething as momentous as a broadening of awareness beyond what has ever been\n\nexperienced even in waking life.\n What a dreamer does with lucidity reflects personal tendencies and\n\nlevels of skill attained usually through experience and practice.\n Although a lucid dreamer can influence the dream 's structure,\n\ncharacters, course, etc., it is not a given that a lucid dream is about what\n\nthe dreamer wants it to be about.\n Seasoned lucid dreamers who are more often lucid than not will\n\ncontinue to encounter psychological and developmental challenges in the\n\ndreamscape.\n The agreeable and the distressing, the easy and difficult, beautiful\n\nand horrifying, are all occasioned much as they are in regular dreaming.\n But whereas a regular dream is filled with the convoluted subtleties\n\nof the subconscious mind enumerating its issues before a largely unconscious\n\ndreamer, a lucid dreamer has the opportunity to consciously explore at any\n\nlevel.\n\n  Lucid dreams usually occur while a person is in the middle of a\n\nregular dream and suddenly realizes that he or she is dreaming.\n The person is then said to be \" lucid\", and may enter one of many\n\nlevels of lucidity.\n At the lowest level, the dreamer may be dimly aware that he or she is\n\ndreaming, but not think rationally enough to realize that\n\nevents/people/actions in the dream are not real/pose no threat.\n At the highest level, the dreamer is fully aware that she or he is\n\nasleep, and can have complete control over his or her actions in the dream.\n However, with low mental control your decisions could be biased not\n\nby your opinion, but by your brain.\n You can control your dreams using the lucid dreaming methods that\n\nfollow. \n\n  During the day, repeatedly ask 'Am I dreaming?' and perform some\n\nreality checks whenever you remember.\n With practice, if it happens enough, you will automatically remember\n\nit during your dreams and do it. \n\n  Keep a dream journal.\n This is perhaps the most important step towards lucid dreaming.\n Keep it close by your bed at night, and write in it immediately after\n\nwaking.\n Or you can keep a recording device if you find it easier to repeat\n\nyour dream out loud.\n This helps you recognize your common dream elements ( people from\n\nyour past, specific places, etc.), and also tells your brain that you are\n\nserious about remembering your dreams! It will also help you to recognize\n\nthings that are unique to your dreams.\n You will be able to recognize your own \" dream signs.\"\n\n These will be recurring things or events that you may notice in your\n\ndreams. \n\n  Learn the best time to have a lucid dream.\n By being aware of your personal sleepschedule, you can arrange your\n\nsleep pattern to help induce lucid dreams.\n\n  Studies strongly suggest that a nap a few hours after waking in\n\nthe morning is the most common time to have a lucid dream. \n\n  Lucid dreams are strongly associated with REM sleep.\n REM sleep is more abundant just before the final awakening.\n This means they most commonly occur right beforewaking up.\n ( Sleep-onset REM is a symptom of narcolepsy.\n If you have lucid dreams right after falling asleep, you may wish to\n\nconsider seeking medical advice from a sleep medicine specialist.\n However, there are studies which show people can recall dreams after\n\nbeing awakened during non-REM sleep). \n\n  Dreams usually run in 60-minute ( Weiten Psych book 2004) cycles\n\nduring sleep.\n If you are working on dream recall, it may be helpful to try waking\n\nyourself up during one of these cycles ( interrupted dreams are often the\n\nones we remember). \n\n  Try Stephen Laberge 's mnemonic induction of lucid dreaming (\n\nMILD) technique.\n Set your alarm clock to wake you up 4 1/2, 6, or 7 1/2 hours after\n\nfalling asleep.\n When you are awakened by your alarm clock, try to remember the dream\n\nas much as possible.\n When you think you have remembered as much as you can, return to your\n\nplace of rest, imagining that you are in your previous dream, and becoming\n\naware that you are dreaming.\n Say to yourself, \" I will be aware that I'm dr 'mming,\" or something\n\nsimilar.\n Do this until you think that it has \" sunk in.\"\n\n Then go to sleep. \n\n  If random thoughts pop up when you are trying to fall asleep,\n\nrepeat the imagining, self-suggestion part, and try again.\n Don't worry if you think it 's taking a long time.\n The longer it takes, the more likely it will 'sink in,' and the more\n\nlikely you will have a lucid dream. \n\n  Attempt the WBTB ( Wake Back To Bed) Technique.\n This is the most successful technique.\n Fall asleep.\n Set your alarm clock to 5 hours after you fall asleep.\n After you wake up, stay up for an hour with your mind focused on\n\nlucidity and lucidity only.\n\n\n  Try attempting the WILD ( wake initiated lucid dream) technique.\n Basically what it means is that when you fall asleep you carry your\n\nawareness from when you were awake directly into REM sleep and you start out\n\nas a lucid dream.\n The easiest way to attempt this technique is if you take an afternoon\n\nnap or you have only slept for 3-7 hours. \n\n  Try to meditate into a calm but focused state.\n You can try counting breaths, imaging ascending/descending stairs,\n\ndropping through the solar system, being in a quiet soundproof area, etc.\n Listening to Theta binaural beats for an amount time will easily put\n\nyou into a REM sleep.\n\n\n  Another technique for overall \" dream awareness\" is the Diamond\n\nMethod of meditation, which can shortcut the overall learning curve, of Lucid\n\nDreaming.\n When one meditates, try to visualize your life, both awake and\n\ndream-life as facets on a diamond.\n Some choose to call this \" diamond\" the Universe, others God, and\n\neven \" your Spirit.\"\n\n The point here is to begin to recognize that life is happening all at\n\nonce.\n It is only our \" Perception\" that arranges our dramas into linear or\n\n\" timed\" order.\n So just as a diamond just is, each facet if viewed as an individual\n\nexperience, still is going on at the same time the \" Dream Body\" experiences\n\nas well.\n This method is also known by Remote Viewers.\n Remember it is just a slight shift in awareness that this exercise\n\ncalls for. \n\n  Immerse yourself in the subject of lucid dreaming.\n For example, you can look on lucid dreaming websites, watch movies\n\nwith lucid dreaming ( eg. Waking Life, Vanilla sky, Inception), read books\n\nabout it, etc... \n\n  Try marking an \" A\" ( which stands for \" awake\") on your palm.\n Every time you notice the \" A\" during your waking hours challenge\n\nwhether you are awake or asleep.\n\n\n  Get into the habit of doing reality checks.\n Do at least three reality checks every time something seems out of\n\nthe ordinary, strongly frustrating, or nonsensical, and that habit will carry\n\non into your dreams.\n In a dream, these will tell you that you are sleeping, allowing you\n\nto become lucid.\n In order to remember to do reality checks in dreams, you need to\n\nestablish a habit of doing reality checks in real life.\n One way to do a reality check is to look for \" dream signs\" (\n\nelements that frequently occur during your dreams, look for these in your\n\ndream journal), or things that would not normally exist in real life, and\n\nthen conduct the reality checks.\n When these actions become habit, a person will begin to do them in\n\nher or his dreams, and can come to the conclusion that he/she is dreaming.\n Frequently doing reality checks can stabilize dreams.\n This is also known as DILD ( Dream Induced Lucid Dreams).\n\n\n  Looking at a digital clock to see if it stays constant; looking\n\nat a body of text, looking away, and then looking back to see if it has\n\nchanged; Flipping a light switch; Looking in a mirror ( your image will most\n\noften appear blurry or not appear at all in a dream).\n However, your figure can be horribly disfigured in a mirror,\n\nfrightening you into nightmare or a dream.\n Pinching your nose closed and trying to breathe; Glancing at your\n\nhands, and asking yourself, \" am I dreaming?\" ( when dreaming, you will most\n\noften see greater or fewer than five fingers on your hand); Jumping in the\n\nair; you are usually able to fly during dreams Poking yourself; when\n\ndreaming, your \" flesh\" might be more elastic than in real life; a common\n\nreality check is pushing your finger through the palm of your hand;\n\nPinch/poke your arm.\n In a dream, you shouldn't be able to feel your pinch/bite.\n However, this may not work since in a dream, actions can still have\n\neffects on your body.\n Try leaning against a wall.\n\n\n  Prolong lucid dreams by spinning your body or falling backwards\n\nin the dream ( suspected of prolonging REM), and rubbing your hands (\n\nprevents you from feeling the sensation of lying in bed).\n Take care while spinning.\n Remind yourself even as you spin or fall that you are dreaming, as\n\nyou will find yourself in a completely different location when you stop\n\nspinning or hit the ground and may lose lucidity otherwise.\n If you feel a dream 'shakes' or is about to fade out, look down to\n\nthe ground and visualize your surroundings, reminding yourself you are\n\ndreaming.\n Be Pro-active about your dream.\n\n\n  Listen to Binaural Beats.\n Binaural Beats are often used to induce lucid dreams, and many assure\n\nthis method dramatically improves success rate.\n Theoretically, listening to Binaural Beats lowers brain frequencies,\n\ntriggering different effects such as relaxation and dream induction.\n Look for Theta binaural beats, as they use the same brainwave\n\nfrequency used in dreams.\n You may also want to listen to Alpha and Delta binaural beats as they\n\nhelp you relax and fall into non-REM sleep. \n\n  \" 'Look through previous dreams in your Dream Journal\"'.\n If you start to notice patterns in your dreams, you will notice\n\ndream-signs, or certain things that continue to reappear in your dreams.\n This may be as basic as all dreams are in your backyard, or all your\n\ndreams have fans in them.\n Get into the habit of doing dream checks every time you see your\n\ndream sign, and eventually you 'll see your dream sign IN a dream, do a check\n\nand realize you 're dreaming.. \n\n\n\n As you prepare for sleep each night, sit in your bed and take a minute to\n\nrelax.\n look at the palms of your hands for 30 minutes, and repeat to\n\nyourself, \" I will dream about\", \" your own dream.\" \n\n  Continue to repeat this phrase, \" I will dream about\", \" your\n\nown dream\" as you look at your hands.\n After the thirty minutes, or whenever you get tired turn off the\n\nlight and go to sleep. \n\n  When you wake during the night, Look at your hand, and say the\n\nsame phrase.\n If you did not see your hands, remind yourself of your intent to see\n\nyour hands in the next dream. \n\n  With consistent practice of this phrase each night before sleep,\n\nyou will suddenly see your hands pop up in front of you when dreaming, and\n\nconsciously realize, \" My hands!\" Oh my gosh! This is a dream. \n\n  Lucid dreaming may be helpful for people who frequently\n\nexperience nightmares, as it gives them a chance to take control of their\n\ndreams. \n\n  It is fun to fly in lucid dreams.\n To start flying try bouncing higher and higher after each step (\n\nwhile \" walking\" in the dream.) Some find that they need to train themselves,\n\nwhile others can just think that they want to fly, and therefore lift off the\n\nground, and start to hover.\n You can also try walking on walls or the ceiling, as flying for the\n\nfirst time can be intimidating if you are not totally convinced that you are\n\ndreaming.\n Many people experience flying as being very natural and very\n\nexhilarating.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "42677981-89df-4d01-8f2b-c031ad6876ad", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.803179+00:00"}
{"text": "Synderesis, the Spark of Conscience, in the English\n\nRenaissance\n\n  It is a remarkable fact that Jerome 's single citation in his\n\ncommentary in the year 415 on Ezekiel 's inaugural vision led to a medieval\n\ntransformation and redefinition of the European idea of conscience that would\n\nendure until the late seventeenth century.\n synteresis\n\n ( later transliterated into Latin and English as synderesis or\n\nsynteresis) was simply a scribal error, it is also possible that he\n\nappropriated the word from a now lost source when he added a fourth element\n\nto Plato 's tripartite soul in his interpretation of Ezekiel 's description of\n\nthe throne of God.\n Whatever the origin of the word, however, the concept expressed by it\n\nappears to have filled a logical need, which probably accounts for its\n\nthorough development and elaboration during the Middle Ages by a series of\n\ncommentators from Peter Lombard to Jean Gerson.\n Their treatment of synderesis over three centuries established its\n\ngeneral definition, posed a set of attendant logical and psychological\n\nproblems, invented a supplemental terminology, and expanded its rhetorical\n\nmeaning hrough biblical exegesis.\n Synderesis played an essential role in the scholastic analysis of\n\nman 's conscience, of his thinking about moral matters, and of his\n\npsychological response to conflicting impulses.\n Stoic and Patristic in its ancient origins and subsequently hedged\n\nabout with safeguarding qualifications against its Pelagian implications,\n\nthis paradoxical assertion of man 's spark of deiformity was an elaboration,\n\nwithin the systematic abstractions of scholastic logic, of the revealed truth\n\nthat man was made in the image and likeness of God ( Genesis 1:27).\n Accordingly, despite his invariably sinful conduct, he knew better and\n\nwas without excuse ( Romans 2:15).\n The idea of synderesis was the expression, in terms of scholastic\n\npsychology, of man 's postlapsarian recognition of the natural law through\n\nright reason.\n At the heart of the theory of synderesis lay an emphatic, if\n\nqualified, endorsement of the light of nature and a consequent assertion of\n\nthe dignity of man.\n\n  The strength of this medieval tradition of thought about\n\nsynderesis was such that it reappeared inevitably in discussions of\n\nconscience through the Renaissance.\n It slowly became clear, however, that the rational affirmations and\n\nimplications of the concept were the Calvinist, skeptical, and fideist\n\nbeliefs of the sixteenth century, and with the protoscientific, secular, and\n\nempiricist intellectual world coming to birth in the following age.\n suffered a gradual\n\neclipse, retaining what life it had only with the decadent scholasticism of\n\nthe universities.\n It was then that the medieval association of synderesis with two\n\nsynonymous terms,  \u001cspark\u001d and  \" natural\n\ninstinct,\u001d and with two descriptive biblical expressions, \n\n\u001cthe spirit of man\u001d and  \u001cthe candle of the Lord,\"2\n\nallowed a metamorphosis to take place.\n Thus an ancient idea that had initially received its definition as a\n\ntechnical term of scholastic anthropology survived in new guises and\n\ncontinued to play a role in late Renaissance thought until the time of Locke\n\nand Butler.\n The history of synderesis forms part of the background for\n\nseventeenth-century speculation about innate ideas and man 's moral sense.\n\n  In two brief sentences in a passage that became a touchstone for\n\nlater commentators Jerome analyzed the meaning of the man, a lion, an ox, and\n\nan eagle, that appear on each of the four creatures who support the throne of\n\nGod in Ezekiel 's vision:\n Most people interpret the man, the lion and the ox as the appetitive\n\nparts of the soul, following Plato 's division, who calls them the \n\n logikon and   thymikon  \n\nand   epithymetikon , locating reason in the\n\nbrain, emotion in the gall bladder, and appetite in the liver.\n And they posit a fourth part which is above and beyond these three,\n\nand which the Greeks call   synteresin   : that\n\nspark of conscience which was not even extinguished in the breast of Cain\n\nafter he was turned out of Paradise, and by which we discern that we sin,\n\nwhen we are overcome by pleasures or frenzy, and meanwhile are misled by an\n\nimitation of reason.\n They reckon that this is, strictly speaking, the eagle, which is not\n\nmixed up with the other three, but corrects them when they go wrong, and of\n\nwhich we read in Scripture as the spirit which  \u001cmaketh intercession\n\nfor us with groanings which cannot be uttered\u001d ( Romans 8:26) \n\n\u001cFor what man knoweth the things of man, save the spirit of man which is in\n\nhim?\u001d ( I Corinthians 2:11)...\n However, we also see that this conscience is cast down in some\n\npeople, who have neither shame nor insight regarding their offenses, and\n\nloses its place.3\n\n  Since no source has been found for Jerome 's vague reference to a\n\n \u001cGreek\u001d ( Byzantine?) original for his use of the word in\n\nthis specific sense, his account remains the initial definition of \n\n\u001csynderesis\u001d to mean con science or a pan or an aspect of conscience.\n\n\ntereo  ( to watch over or preserve) and accordingly means\n\npreservation or the power that preserves.4\n In identifying synderesis as a fourth, independent, and\n\nsuperintendent part of the soul, in placing it in apposition with the\n\nmetaphoric  \u001cspark of conscience\u001d (   scintilla\n\nconscientiae   ) , in citing the story of Cain to exemplify\n\nits inextinguishability, and in explicating it by referring to the biblical\n\n \u001cspirit of man,\u001d as he proceeds to do, Jerome established a\n\nframe of discourse that dominated subsequent discussion.\n\n  Jerome 's reference to synderesis might have remained a forgotten\n\nobservation if two citations of it had not propelled it into the mainstream\n\nof medieval thought.\n\n\nPeter Lombard made reference to Jerome 's passage in his  Sentences \n\n( 1152), which became the standard theological textbook of the period.5\n The context is a discussion of how the will can choose to follow an\n\nevil course of action while continuing to experience a simultaneous\n\nattraction to the good.\n and in later\n\ndiscussions of the powers of the soul, a philosophic definition of the\n\nconcept of synderesis evolved until both its existence and central importance\n\nbecome familiar assumptions in the philosophy of the Middle Ages.\n\n  Synderesis was eventually understood to be an innate inclination\n\nor habit of the first principles of the practical reason about good and evil.\n It was the source of infallible natural intuitions of the basic\n\nmoral; of the natural law, principles recognized and embraced immediately,\n\nonce their terms were understood.\n It exercised an inextinguishable authority in correcting the mistaken\n\ninclinations and judgments of the irascible, concupiscible, and rational\n\npowers of the soul.\n dictamen\n\nrationis   was linked with the   ratio sublimior\n\n  of St. Augustine and was the source of the principles upon\n\nwhich conscience acted or failed to act; taken together with conscience, as\n\nJohn of Damascus pointed out, it had the force of  \u001cthe law of our\n\nmind\u001d in murmuring against inclining man to the good.\n Yet it was merely a relic or remnant of that original moral integrity\n\nthat had been lost by mankind in the fall.\n Its paradoxical mixture of strength and weakness was well expressed\n\nin the metaphor of the spark, which suggested both the purity of essential\n\nlight and heat in the midst of dead ashes and the fragility of weakness and\n\nthreatened extinction.\n It was a vestige of man 's original rectitude and as such an ironic\n\nand pathetic reminder of the image of God in which man had been created.\n Jeremiah ( 31:33) and Paul ( Romans 2:15) were understood by medieval\n\nexegetes to be describing synderesis when they spoke of  \u001cthe law\n\nwritten in the heart\u001d which rendered man inexcusable.\n\n  Certain examples of the universal moral principles of the natural\n\nlaw recognized by synderesis were usually presented in discussions of its\n\nnature; these included:  \u001cdo good and avoid evil\";  \u001cGod is to\n\nbe worshipped\"; and  \u001cdo not do to others what you do not want\n\ndone to you.\u001d Principles such as these, it came to be argued, served\n\nas the major premises of the syllogisms which logically underlay all human\n\nmoral actions.\n These premises, recognized by synderesis in a non-deliberative\n\nintuition, always remained necessary, inviolate, and unchangeable, while the\n\n   judgments of discursive reason and\n\nconscience in the minor premise were and could be mistaken; they introduced\n\nthe possibility of error into the process of moral reasoning.\n\n  A second citation was of equal or perhaps greater importance in\n\nbringing the term  \u001csynderesis\u001d into general use.\n Ordinary Gloss\n\n ( 1150) as part of its marginal explication of this notoriously\n\nperplexing book and passage of the Bible.\n is well\n\nillustrated by the fact that those who commented on the  Sentences \n\ninvariably mined the  Gloss 's  quotation of Jerome for arguments in\n\ntheir discussions of synderesis.\n In fact, when we examine the widening circles of meaning that\n\nsurround  \u001csynderesis,\u001d it is readily apparent that, almost\n\nwithout exception, their center remains Jerome 's few sentences.\n The ambiguity arising from his apposition of the unfamiliar word \"\n\nsynderesis\u001d with the phrase  \u001cthat spark of\n\nconscience\u001d led to one of two conclusions: that synderesis was simply\n\nanother name, albeit a Greek technical name, for conscience, or that\n\nsynderesis was a distinct and specific part or aspect of conscience, called\n\n \u001cthe spark.\u001d The first view led to the indiscriminate use of\n\n \u001csynderesis\u001d for conscience by those who confused the Greek\n\n synteresis  with the similar word for conscience  syneidesis\n\n .\n The second view resulted in an independent semantic identity and\n\nhistory for the term  scintilla  or \" spark.\u001d Jerome adds a\n\nfourth term to this confusion when, following the lead of Origen and Gregory\n\nNazianzus, he puts both  \u001csynderesis\u001d and  \u001cthat spark\n\nof conscience\u001d in further apposition with the biblical expression\n\n \u001cthe spirit of man.\u001d The uncertainties rooted in these\n\nambiguous appositions flowered in the expanding definitions and varied use of\n\n \u001csynderesis\u001d well into the seventeenth century; these\n\ncontrast with the aura of technical precision that has attended this term\n\nfrom its rebirth in Christian speculation in the Middle Ages.\n\n  Given these uncertainties, it is appropriate and prophetic that\n\nPeter Lombard, in the first notable quotation of Jerome 's passage, ignored\n\n synteresis  altogether and substituted  superior  . . .\n\nscintilla rationis   for Jerome 's   scintilla\n\nconscientiae   .\n Despite the new term, there is little doubt that Peter meant to refer\n\nto conscience, and that he was understood to do so.\n scintilla rationis\n\n  , however, behind which almost certainly lay the influence\n\nof Augustine 's identification, in  The City of God  , of the \n\nscintilla ration  is with the image of God in man, behind which lay an\n\nearlier Greek tradition exemplified by Tatian 's reference to the soul \n\n\" retaining, as it were, a spark of its power\u001d certainly promoted the\n\nsubstitution of  scintilla  , as a kind of shorthand, for \n\n\u001csynderesis.\u001d There is also no doubt that  scintilla \n\ncontinued to carry with it overtones of meaning derived from its association\n\nin Jerome 's passage with con science and the spirit of man.\n\n \n\nbegan to take on a life of its own as the most striking and prevalent\n\nmetaphor among the alternative descriptive terms for synderesis.\n It was pressed into service by those who wrote in the mystical\n\ntradition.\n Bonaventure, for example, summarizes the six degrees or powers of the\n\nsoul, rising from the external to the internal, from the temporal to the\n\neternal, as  \u001csenses, imagination, reason, understanding, intelligence\n\nand, at the tip of the mind, the spark of moral discernment\u001d ( \n\n et, apex mentis, seu, synderesis scintilla   ) .7\n\nThe idea of  \u001cthe spark\u001d or  vunkelin  was central to\n\nMeister Eckhart 's explanation of his mystical experiences and teachings.\n The expression of his views in metaphorical language may have\n\nresulted in their condemnation as heretical by Pope John XXII in 1329, but\n\nhis religious and philosophic ideas were in fact traditional and orthodox.\n For example, although he is the first to employ a vernacular\n\nequivalent for  scintilla  , the most recent study of Eckhart 's\n\nthought maintains that he identified the   vunkelin \n\n with the  ratio superior  and  \u001cintroduced into\n\nmedieval psychology no really new factor regarding human cognitive\n\ncapabilities.\"8\n\n  By the time of Jean Gerson at the end of the fourteenth century\n\nsynderesis is afloat on a sea of metaphors and explanatory circumlocutions.\n In the definition of terms for the function and powers of the soul in\n\n Gerson 's De Theologia Mystica, synderesis  is followed by an\n\nacknowledgment that it is known by a variety of other names.\n Gerson understands synderesis to be the highest of the affective\n\npowers, corresponding to and interacting with  the simplex intelligentia\n\n ( pure intelligence) of the cognitive powers;9 and he defines it as\n\n \u001can appetitive power of the soul which receives a certain natural\n\ninclination to good immediately from God, through which it is led to follow a\n\ngood motion presented to it from the apprehension of pure\n\nintelligence.\u001d\n \u001cWe refer to synderesis,\n\nhowever, by other names: either a practical habit of principles, or the spark\n\nof intelligence ...\n or a virginal part of the soul, or a natural stimulus to good, or the\n\napex of the mind, or an imperishable instinct, or such other names as the\n\nfirst heaven among the affective powers.\"10\n recta ratio, superior\n\npars rationis, vertex animae, scintilla intelligentiae   , and\n\nthe   modicum lumen   leading to God.11\n The resemblance between what was meant by synderesis and what the\n\nStoics called  nous  and to  \n\nhegemonikon 12 was recognized at an early stage and repeated\n\ninto the Renaissance.\n It was also obvious that synderesis was the

{"text": "Dear Jim,\n\n  I\u0019m writing to you, finally, on my 32nd birthday, after so much\n\ntime passing between my last letter to you.\n It\u0019s not for lack of want that I\u0019ve been silent on this end; rather, I\n\nseem to easily find ways to get myself involved in every kind of\n\ntime-consuming opportunity.\n It\u0019s in my nature, I guess, since I never seem to be able to pass up\n\nthe change to learn, to grow, to try on a new hat. \n\n I\u0019ve been thinking a lot about the last time we spoke--- December 24th if\n\nmemory serves me right\u0019and I have to say that there has been more than enough\n\nfood for thought given the circumstances.\n\n  You said that it has been years since you\u0019ve spoken to your oldest\n\nson, or that he has repeatedly ignored your attempts to make peace ( which\n\nI\u0019m sure, knowing you as well as I do, were sincere.\n I hope you can understand my point when I say that his behavior\n\ntowards you may have been warranted when he was a teenager, but it is\n\ndisconcertingly inappropriate at this point in his life.\n If I understand correctly, your son was 18 when you \u001cran away,\u001d as you\n\nput it, which means he was, at least legally, an adult.\n I do not have any doubt that he felt the pain of your sudden divorce.\n I don\u0019t imagine that that would be an easy situation for any person to\n\ndeal with--- his being the oldest of your kids and being the one who felt\n\nlike he was forced to be the replacement for you.\n And this may be conjecture on my part, and if it is a gross\n\nmisrepresentation of the facts, I\u0019ll ask you to forgive me, but during the\n\ntime of your divorce, I believe your ex-wife spoke of you in the most\n\ndiabolical of terms.\n This was, at least, the impression I got from my parents, who have\n\npretty clear memories respectively as to how the circumstances had been\n\nrelated to them via your ex-wife\u0019s friends.\n There is no way your son was immune to that type of indoctrination,\n\nfor lack of a better term.\n Those were formative years for him, and he was impressionable to a\n\ndegree that was perhaps even greater than the average 18 year old, given the\n\nidyllic childhood he experienced out on the \u001clittle farm.\u001d\n He was really removed from any hardships, I think, without a job,\n\netc. \n\n  I know that you have taken an interest in the life of Buddha, who\n\nalso lived a life totally removed from the more negative sides of life,\n\nnamely, sickness, poverty, and death.\n And he too was shocked almost to the point of depression by what he\n\nsaw when he finally left his bubble.\n I think this is partly reminiscent of your son\u0019s situation, which is\n\nwhy the smack of divorce hit him so hard. \n\n Let me just\n\nsay that if you are ever in need of an ear, a friend, a sounding-board, a\n\nsailing-partner, a pal to drink martinis with\"as Leonard Cohen would say, - -\n\nI\u0019m you\u0019re man. \n\n  I thought I would write a little more to you about that book I\n\nhad mentioned over Christmas.\n I hate to put it like this, but it was a real pain to try to explain\n\nthe book\u0019s contents to Doctor and Mrs. Naleburn, mainly because they were\n\nonly interested in hearing what they wanted to hear, if that makes sense.\n For example, I am always nervous around people who tell me that they\n\nare \u001cexcellent writers,\u001d who are the \u001cgrammar police,\u001d who \u001ccorrect [ him]\n\nall the time,\u001d and who \u001ccan\u0019t stand to listen to the way people speak\n\nnowadays.\u001d\n Jim, let me tell you, I\u0019ve studied the English language, and language\n\nin general, to a degree that is much, much greater than most of the people in\n\nthe world.\n Everything I have learned has taught me that the only people who say\n\nthose things are people who were born into a kind of privilege that they\n\nthemselves don\u0019t recognize, think they earned, and would never acknowledge.\n Language, in many ways, is like music as a form of expression: One\n\nwould never tell Chopin to change the tempo of his nocturne, or tell Mozart\n\nto stop writing for the winds, right\"\n When people become self-proclaimed \u001cgrammar police,\u001d I have to wonder\n\nwhat is behind their interest in, often erroneously, pointing out \u001cmistakes\u001d\n\nin the language of others.\n Language is so closely related to personal identity that when people\n\nare criticized for their way of communicating, it can be expected that they\n\nwill lose a deal of self-esteem.\n And Jim, I\u0019m not saying that this is the case with Mrs. Naleburn\n\nentirely ( although I suspect it does come into play), but it seems to me\n\nthat so many of these arguments about language are really arguments against\n\nnon-white ethnic minorities.\n\n  I\u0019m sure that you would disagree with me on that latter point,\n\nand I wouldn\u0019t blame you for doing so, but I hear the same types of arguments\n\nbeing used all the time by people when they want to criticize anyone who is\n\nnot white.\n For instance, I was taking a break from teaching the other morning\n\nand standing outside for one of our first spring days.\n There were three women from the building standing outside smoking and\n\nI overheard them talking about health insurance in Massachusetts. Now, as you\n\nknow, that is a topic that is near and dear to my heart, having basically\n\ngone broke paying for the reconstruction of the broken bones in my foot (\n\nhey?.shouldn\u0019t all good American teachers face starvation as a result of\n\ncriminally high insurance and medical bills?).\n So, somehow, these woman get to talking about how annoyed they are\n\nabout some illegal immigrants in Massachusetts who approached the Governor in\n\nhopes of getting some of the Commonwealth\u0019s insurance coverage.\n Boy, did these women have a lot of nasty, ignorant things to say!\n And since I\u0019m going to hell anyway, I might as well stereotype here:\n\nThese were the South Shore\u0019s trashiest of Irish white people.\n So I saw my chance to get in on the conversation by telling them, \u001cOh\n\nyeah, I have a story for you guys!\u001d\n At this point, I related the following story with a straight face:\n\n\n\n  So my dad owns a small restaurant outside the city and he\u0019s been\n\nworking himself to the bones for the past twenty years to raise six kids. He\n\nhas been getting up in age and so after all that time, he finally decides to\n\nlook for a little help in the kitchen.\n One day, these two people come in, a guy and girl, who was pregnant,\n\nand they tell my dad they are looking for a job.\n My dad asks them what they can do and they say that they are willing\n\nto do anything because they don\u0019t have a lot of money and they want to send\n\nmoney back home to their families.\n So, of course my father starts to suspect that they are illegal\n\nimmigrants when he asks them about paperwork.\n They start to explain that they have no papers and that they will\n\nwork extremely hard even without papers.\n So my dad is someone who already hates illegal immigrants, so he\n\ngrabs the guy by his shirt and he says, \u001cListen to me you dirty bastard\u001dwhy\n\ndon\u0019t you and this welfare collecting baby machine get back on the boat and\n\ngo right back to Ireland where you came from!? \n\n Needless to say, Jim, they had no idea what to make of that little story.\n\n<3> It would have been pointless to lie so blatantly about my dad, but when I\n\nsaw how they were just barely hiding their racism by using the word \u001cillegal\u001d\n\nto mean Hispanic, I couldn\u0019t help but use the Irish example.\n You never hear people talk about the Canadians or the Irish when they\n\ntalk about immigration?.and that really bothers me!\n I actually felt badly about duping these three brainiacs, but it was\n\nreally worth the laugh!\n\n So do you think this will be another year for us to get out on the boat?\n I\u0019d really love to get out to Misery Island this summer, but this\n\ntime, just the two of us.\n Of course, I really loved having Aunt Bard and my wife with us, but\n\nwhen it\u0019s just the two of us, we can really say what we want and make the\n\nrules as we go.\n We both know that when the ladies are there, we immediately lose our\n\nright to captain ourselves!!\n I know you sort of enjoy the fact that Barb acts like the boss even\n\nin a context in which she is entirely clueless ( i.e. the sailboat), but\n\ngetting the lecture about the gin and tonics was too much.\n Even if one didn\u0019t know that your wife and my mother were sisters,\n\nyou would know it intuitively by the way they demand adherence to their\n\nhilarious world-view.\n What did Barb say when we were finally back and tied up to the\n\nmooring?\n \" do you think it\u0019s safe to have a drink while we\u0019re still on the\n\nboat, Jim?\n How are you going to row us back to the shore?\"\n Boy, Jim, I\u0019ll never know how you lived without my aunt for so many\n\nyears, and how you practiced medicine without her for most of your adult\n\nlife!!\n\n\n Ha!\n I can\u0019t believe I got distracted and forget to tell you about the\n\nbook.\n Well, what I would say, to finish the point I was trying to make a\n\nfew months backs, is that there are really a handful of revolutionary things\n\nhappening in the field of linguistics.\n One of them is the creation of a new theory of language proposed by a\n\nProfessor over at Tufts University, who was actually a student of Noam\n\nChomsky\u0019s many year ago.\n And believe it or not, this man, whom I believe to be the greatest\n\nlinguist in the world, live not three block away from my house.\n The book itself is worth reading if you think you wont be bored by\n\nlooking so closely at language in such scientific terms, but it is quite an\n\naccomplishment as far as academic works go.\n Truth be told, I am hesitant to recommend this guy\u0019s book to other\n\nlinguists, though, because I have found the Professor to be somewhat\n\noff-putting and unapproachable.\n I recently met with him to discuss PhD study under his guidance or\n\nunder his partial supervision, and he was not even willing to take a look at\n\nthe 150 page master\u0019s thesis I produced using his research---- and I can\n\nassure you, a the time I published it, there were very, very few publications\n\navailable in which his views were being advanced by people who were not\n\neither his grad students or his colleagues.\n In short, I felt he was just an arrogant person and I actually feel\n\nstupid for putting so much faith into his work.\n Why should I support someone who couldn\u0019t even take a few minutes to\n\nsee what I had to offer?\n I think it was a pedigree issue, too, since my MA degree is from\n\nUMass and not MIT or Harvard.\n An in a bizarre twist of fate, I actually got rejected from the PhD\n\nprogram at Tufts ( after being wait-listed) only to find that the folks at\n\nMIT are pushing me to apply! \n\n Jim, you\u0019ll have to forgive me for cutting this note short, but I have\n\ngot to go to sleep. I love you and can\u0019t wait to see you again!", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b09afeb3-c434-45ac-b76c-5f31effe871a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.805682+00:00"}
{"text": "While narcissistic vulnerability is a central feature of both\n\nnormal and pathological development during adolescence, the author proposes\n\ncriteria to differentiate between them.\n The specific features of the narcissistic personality disorders, as it\n\nbegins to crystalize in childhood and adolescence include: reliance on an\n\nomnipotent sense of self, refusal to acknowledge shortcomings and\n\nvulnerability, projection of disowned self-experiences onto others, and\n\ndemands for public affirmation of their power.\n Those clinical variations of narcissistic pathology-the\n\nhistrionic-exhibitionistic, the ruthless-psychopathic, and the\n\nself-victimizing masochistic-are discussed.\n\n\n  The confusion and contradictions imbuing the psychological world\n\nof the adolescent are perhaps surpassed only by the formulations created to\n\nexplain them.\n Psychoanalytic writings by Blos1 and A. Freud2 state that psychic\n\nturmoil and regression are not just normative but are also essential for\n\nhealthy development.\n Such emphasis led Adelson and Doehrman3 to quip that, in the\n\npsychoanalytic literature, the adolescent is depicted as \" miraculously\n\nholding on to his sanity, but doing so only by undertaking prodigies of\n\ndefense\" ( p. 105).\n From this vantage point, it is extremely difficult to differentiate\n\nthe normal crisis of adolescence from the pathological manifestations of\n\ndisturbed youth. \n\n  Conversely, academic psychologists wax eloquently on adolescents'\n\nrelentless expansion of cognitive, moral, social, coping, and adaptive\n\ncapacities.\n The view from the academic perspective reveals young people mostly\n\ncommitted to a quest for truth, intolerant of adult hypocrisy, and feeling\n\npassionately and intensely about relationships and ideals.\n Current theories fail to adequately encompass the paradoxes of\n\nadolescence.\n The study of narcissistic regulation and narcissistic vulnerability\n\ndoes, however, provide a window onto the paradoxes marking normal and\n\npathological development in adolescence.\n Better understanding these processes promises to illuminate a broad\n\nrange of clinically and developmentally significant issues. \n\n  Perhaps like no other phase of fife, the passage through\n\nadolescence bears the hallmarks of narcissistic vulnerability: a proneness to\n\nembarrassment and shame, acute self-consciousness and shyness, and painful\n\nquestions about self-esteem and self-worth.\n How is this vulnerability different from pathological narcissism?\n To answer this question we must first examine the phenomenon of\n\nnarcissistic regulation against the background of some evolving ideas about\n\nhow subjective experience is organized and structured. \n Motivational Systems, Internal Representational\n\nModels, and Narcissistic Regulation   \n\n  Over the past two decades, infancy studies4,5 have produced an\n\nincreasingly clearer and more coherent picture of the unfolding and\n\nstructuring of infants' and young children 's subjective experience and\n\nintrapsychic reality.\n In particular, research has systematically documented the biases,\n\npreferences, and predispositions built into the human brain; the motivational\n\nsystems giving direction to the organization of experience; and the tools for\n\ninformation processing, memory, perception, affect, and arousal regulation\n\nthat become available to infants to construct their intrapsychic world. \n\n  Although the views emerging from research support a number of\n\npsychoanalytic ideas about early development, they also challenge many\n\nassumptions held by psychoanalysts about the nature and content of the\n\ninfant 's psychic life.\n The creative tension between the prospective and normative view\n\nevolving out of direct observation and research with infants and children, as\n\nwell as the retrospective and pathographic perspective generated by\n\npsychoanalysis, offers a rich opportunity to enhance our understanding of\n\npsychological development in normality and in psychopathology. \n\n  Two intertwined motivational systems are particularly relevant to\n\na discussion of narcissistic regulation.\n Infancy research amply supports Fairbaim 's6 seminal contention of the\n\nprimacy of the human craving for sustaining connections with others.\n Observation and research document a powerful tendency in the human\n\nspecies to seek out and elicit engagement with others from the beginning of\n\nfife, a built-in motivation for social fittedness.7 As Stern5 noted, neonates\n\nare preprogrammed to recognize people, to prefer human stimulation above all\n\nother, and to develop the behavioral repertoire of attachment.\n Distress escalating to overwhelming anxiety and organismic\n\nvulnerability follow disruption of the infant 's attachments.\"'\n The weight of the accumulated evidence led Greenberg and Mitchelll2\n\nto conclude that the search for two-way relationships and the need for human\n\nreciprocity is as preemptory a human motive as supposedly more basic\n\nbiological needs.\n Thus it appears highly unlikely that the pairing of human beings for\n\nthe gratification of biological needs is a precondition to the child 's\n\ninterest in relating to other humans.\n We are, as Greenberg and Mitchell12 explain, essentially drawn to\n\nrelate, endowed with a brain inherently wired to generate, organize, and\n\npattern psychological experience resulting from transactions in an\n\ninterpersonal context.\n The affective correlate of this perceptual-cognitive bias is\n\nseparation anxiety.\n KandeII3 has pointed out the likely innate neurobiological readiness\n\nto trigger or downplay a fight-or-flight sequence of anger, anxiety, and\n\nhyperarousal in response to the respective absence or reappearance of\n\ncaretakers.\n Other humans, says Kandel13 evoke a built-in, ready-to-be-activated\n\nsignal of safety.\n One of the basic roots of anxiety thus appears to be a biologically\n\nprogrammed tendency to respond to separations with anxiety and to reunions\n\nwith relief. \n\n  Infancy research also strongly supports the existence of a\n\npowerful built-in predisposition toward self-regulation and mastery, and an\n\ninnate tendency to create perceptual-experiential coherence and organization.\n As Emde7 remarks, the infant comes into the world \" with biologically\n\nprepared active propensities and with organized capacities for\n\nself-regulation\" ( p. 38).\n Stern5 also noted an innate tendency to develop predictable patterns\n\nand to connect in one 's mind what goes together in reality, as well as a\n\ncorresponding affective response of distress when organization cannot be\n\ncreated or when the expected experiential coherence-the match between the\n\nmental model and reality itself-is disrupted. \n\n  The distressing consequences of a disruption in experiential\n\ncoherence were well described in Freud 's early writings.\n Freud and Breuer14 compared hysteria with the traumatic neurosis.\n In both instances, they claimed, an event had become pathogenic\n\nbecause it could not be integrated into the dominant mass of ideas ( the\n\npsychic organization that Freud subsequently designated as the ego).\n Thus the experience in question could not be processed through the\n\nnormal psychological mechanisms and instead persisted, unmetabolized, seeking\n\nexpression through somatic channels. \n\n  Almost 30 years later, Freud15 conceptualized trauma as the\n\nexperience of being overwhelmed by an adaptive demand that renders the ego\n\npassive, helpless, and unable to anticipate, cope, integrate, and retain any\n\nsense of control.\n According to Freud, the essence and meaning of the traumatic\n\nsituation consists of \" the subject 's estimation of his own strength compared\n\nto the magnitude of the danger and his admission of helplessness.\"15\n As a corollary, Freud described the ego 's tendency to attempt a\n\nturnaround of such passivity and helplessness in an effort to gain ( or\n\nregain) a measure of activity and mastery.\n Freud believed that the tendency was critical to advancing the\n\nindividual 's most basic narcissistic pursuits, that is, the capacity for\n\nself-preservation. \n\n  Freud 's ideas provide a framework for conceptualizing the\n\nphenomena of narcissistic vulnerability and narcissistic regulation.\n In contrast, however, to the opposition Freudl6,17 postulated between\n\nnarcissism and object relatedness, developmental studies point to an\n\nintertwining of these two motivational systems.\n In Greenberg and Mitchell 's12 formulation, human beings are both\n\nself-regulating and field regulating.\n We are, say Greenberg and Mitchell, fundamentally concerned with both\n\nthe efforts to create and maintain coherence, mastery, and organization \n\nand  with the efforts to create and maintain connections with others.\n\n\n\n  More to the point, efforts to gain mastery, reduce helplessness,\n\nand achieve experiential coherence coalesce in normal development with the\n\npursuit of relationships in a mutually reinforcing process.\n Sande18 and Ainsworth and Bell19 make the point that the infants'\n\ncompetence is contingent on the presence of alert and responsive caregivers.\n To achieve a sense of mastery and produce a state of experiential\n\ncoherence, infants can turn around their experience of passivity and\n\nhelplessness, brought about by adaptive demands-whether from within or from\n\nwithout-only when they can signal and evoke attuned responses from their\n\ncaretakers.\n The appropriate response, for example, to a signal of hunger\n\ntransforms the infant 's internal state from that of hunger-and helplessness\n\nin the face of it-to that of satiation and a regained sense of mastery.\n Such transactional sequences certainly permit the restoration of a\n\nphysiological homeostasis, which reinforces the attachment system.\n They also provide the template for mental schemas of those episodes.\n Stern5 describes how the infant 's abstraction of the common or\n\ninvariant features of those transactional episodes leads to the construction\n\nof representations of interactions generalized ( RIGs) which are subsequently\n\norganized into internal working models or internal representations of the\n\nself in relation to others.\n These internal representational models ( IRMs) provide a prototype\n\nfor the sense of self as competent and worthy, and of others as responsive.\n Not surprisingly, disturbances of narcissistic regulation invariably\n\ninvolve concerns about being ignored or not given attention, often coupled\n\nwith doubt about the ability to have an impact on or to evoke responses from\n\nothers.\n Given this built-in motivational push toward self-regulation and\n\nobject relationships, infants will almost inevitably- as soon as memory and\n\nrepresentational capacities permit-construct IRMs both to guide their search\n\nfor human connections more effectively and to anticipate reality 's demands.\n\n\n\n  As the infants' representational competence grows during the\n\nsecond half of their first year of life, they can utilize their IRMs not only\n\nto anticipate but also to organize future interactions.\n Stern5 and others have described the obvious shift in the \" social\n\nfeel\" of infants around seven to nine months.\n Not only are these children more likely to initiate interactions but\n\nthey also appear to \" demand\" specific responses from caretakers-that is,\n\nresponses that match their IRMs.\n A representational mismatch20,21 may be a major precipitant of\n\nso-called stranger 's anxiety,22 because the stranger does not match the\n\ninfant 's IRMs.\n Yet again, object relatedness is intertwined with efforts to secure\n\ncontrol and experiential coherence.\n Social referencing23,24 is evident after six months of age.\n When infants are confronted with a novel or uncertain situation, that\n\nis, a situation lacking an IRM, they seek to resolve the uncertainty by\n\nobtaining emotional clues from a caretaker.\n The representational match is established but mediated by emotional\n\ninformation provided by the caretaker. \n ACTUAL SELF, IDEAL SELF, AND NARCISSISTIC REGULATION\n\n \n\n  The growing development of categorical thinking and symbolic\n\ncapacity during the second half of the second year of life provides children\n\nwith an extraordinary new tool for achieving mastery, control, and\n\nexperiential coherence, ( i.e., narcissistic well-being). \n\n  Children become increasingly capable of creating a mental\n\nrepresentation, which Joffe and Sandler25 call the \" ideal self \" This ideal\n\nself is in the shape of a self-representation associated with a sense of\n\nsafety, competence, and satisfaction.\n The ideal self conjures up the experience of mastery, control,\n\nexperiential integration, and optimal ability to meet adaptive demands.\n Such an \" Ideal self\" also transacts optimally with available and\n\nresponsive others. \n\n  What are the building blocks of this mental representation?\n According to Joffe and Sandler, the ideal self is a composite of: (\n\na) memories of actual experiences of pleasure, mastery, satisfaction, and\n\ncompetence ( with particular emphasis on memories of the infants' successful\n\nevocation of caretakers' responses that lead to a restored sense of\n\nnarcissistic well-being); ( b) fantasies about such experiences ( which\n\nbecome increasingly more elaborated symbolically and more available to serve\n\ndefensive purposes); and ( c) the models provided by important people who are\n\nloved, feared, or admired. \n\n  An example of this representational composite is found in the\n\nfollowing vignette. \n\n\n  A two-and-a-half-year-old boy protests loudly when his parents,\n\nboth busy professionals, leave on certain evenings to attend a professional\n\nevent.\n The parents, in attempts to comfort the child that are as driven by\n\nguilt as by empathy, tell him, \" We have to go to a meeting, dear, but when\n\nyou wake up, we will be back.\"\n A few weeks later, the boy is happily tiding up and down the driveway\n\non his brand new tricycle.\n \" I'm go 'mg to a meeting,\" he proudly announces to his father.\n Rather sheepishly the father replies, \" Great, Johnny, have fun.\"\n The father 's endorsement, however, only elicits the child 's scorn.\n \" No, no, daddy..., \" the child chides the father with exasperation, \"\n\nCry!\"\n When the chastised father finally \" gets it\" and \" weeps\" in\n\ndistress, the child triumphantly says, \" It 's okay, daddy, when you wake up,\n\nI' 'llbe back.\" \n\n  This vignette illustrates the use of a model as a blueprint, a\n\nroad map guiding the child 's efforts to reverse states of helplessness and\n\npassivity.\n He is no longer the one being left but instead is the one leaving.\n Rather than be the recipient of the comforting words, he is the one\n\nattempting to soothe.\n The mental representation of the object provides an internal model to \"\n\nmatch\" or approximate. \n\n  According to Joffe and Sandler,25 narcissistic vulnerability\n\nresults from the mismatch or incongruence between the ideal self and the\n\nactual self, which is the conscious and unconscious sense individuals have of\n\ntheir characteristics, capacities, and ability to respond to adaptive\n\ndemands.\n The tendency toward experiential congruity now encompasses both\n\nexternal reality and the internal model of the ideal self. \n\n  Narcissistic vulnerability refers to a painful state of\n\nself-appraisal whose affective correlate is the feeling of shame.\n The prototypical affect of narcissistic vulnerability, shame reflects\n\nthe sense of deflation accompanying the inability to measure up to an ideal.\n Narcissistic well-being or self- esteem, however, results from the\n\nsuccessful shaping of the actual after the ideal self.\n Affects, as Emde7 has pointed out, promote the organization of\n\nexperience by providing a system of incentives and disincentives for\n\nfunctioning both on an internal psychological level and on a social\n\ninteractive context.\n Expression of affects also serves as a social signal that evokes\n\nresponses from others.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0eba5e3c-487e-4109-a240-861e334b9735", "added":

{"text": "The Commonwealth of Massachusetts subsidizes thousands of housing\n\nunits through a variety of programs.\n These units are available for renters within certain income limits.\n They can be found in new apartment complexes, rehabilitated buildings\n\nsuch as row houses, townhouses, garden apartments, or even converted\n\nbuildings such as former schools or warehouses.\n Some of these developments may have only a certain percentage of the\n\nunits subsidized.\n Some are available only for elderly or handicapped households; others\n\nare not restricted in this way.\n\n  There are developments which are publicly owned; that is, they\n\nare controlled by a local housing authority, such as the Boston Housing\n\nAuthority, Worcester Housing Authority, Springfield Housing Authority, and\n\nauthorities in smaller towns such as Medway, Rockport and Wareham.\n There are developments which are owned by private housing developers\n\nbut are publicly subsidized and therefore available to low income\n\npersons.\n\n\n  Public Housing is owned and managed by the approximately 258\n\nlocal housing authorities and 4 regional housing authorities in\n\nMassachusetts.\n Not every community in the state has a local housing authority or is\n\nserved by a regional housing authority.\n Most of the larger cities and towns do have housing authorities,\n\nhowever.\n The housing authorities are public agencies, governed by state and/or\n\nfederal laws.\n The members of the authority 's Board of Commissioners is elected or\n\nappointed by the city or town.\n\n\n\n  Housing authorities operate several different programs for\n\nfamilies, elderly and residents with disabilities.\n If you have a disability, you may also find units with accessible\n\nfeatures in either a family or elderly-oriented development.\n You must be at least 62 years of age or handicapped to be eligible\n\nfor state funded elderly housing.\n\n  There are developments that have a mixture of all types of\n\nhouseholds.\n Many of the smaller authorities have only one type of housing, so you\n\nhave to call to find out if they have the type of development you are\n\nseeking.\n\n  There are maximum income limits for different size households\n\nwishing to apply for public housing.\n These income limits are set separately by the federal and state\n\ngovernments for their respective developments and will vary slightly.\n\n  Income limits change over time and vary for different areas in\n\nthe state, so you have to ask about these limits at the housing authority, or\n\nauthorities, where you might be interested in living.\n For example, in 1996 for state-funded public housing in the Boston\n\narea, a single person household could have an income up to\n\n&dollar;29,100; and a four person household could have an income up to\n\n&dollar;41,600. \n\n  Families and individuals who qualify for public housing pay a\n\nrent which is up to 30% of their adjusted income.\n\n  Persons whose annual income exceed the limits established by\n\neither federal or state regulation are not eligible for public housing.\n Likewise, persons who have a consistently poor record of meeting\n\ntheir rent payments, or who have a history of disturbing people, destroying\n\nproperty or involvement in illegal activities may not be housed by the local\n\npublic housing authority.\n\n\n  You should contact your local or regional authority to find out\n\nwhere they take applications.\n You can fill out an application for more than one authority,\n\ndepending on where you would like to live or how immediate your housing need\n\nis.\n First, you should call several authorities to see what might be\n\navailable and how long you would be on their waiting lists.\n Then you should go to those authorities where you have your best\n\nchance and fill out an application, even though the location of the housing\n\nmay not be your first choice.\n\n\n  Once you have turned in your application you will be placed on\n\nthe authority 's waiting list in chronological order ( according to the\n\nsubmission date of your completed application).\n Every housing authority has a tenant selection plan which provides\n\npriority categories to determine the order applicants are offered housing.\n At the time you apply, you should be sure to inform the authority of\n\nany special circumstances you or your family may face so that you may be\n\nplaced as soon as possible.\n\n  In certain housing authorities you will be given a preference if\n\nyou choose to be housed in a program where your race is substantially\n\nunder-represented.\n\n  Since the waiting lists vary in length at each authority, you\n\nshould inquire about the approximate waiting time when you apply.\n It is VERY IMPORTANT to keep the authority informed about any changes\n\nin address or status while you are on the waiting list, so that they can send\n\nyou notices, and contact you from time to time about mailing list updates,\n\nchanges in program regulations, etc.\n They must know how to contact you when your name reaches the top of\n\nthe list.\n\n\n  You can ask to be placed on the waiting list for every program of\n\nthe authority for which you are eligible and qualified, which will minimize\n\nthe waiting time for a unit to be offered and help you make the choice about\n\nwhere you want to live.\n IN WHAT ORDER ARE TENANTS SELECTED FROM HOUSING AUTHORITY\n\nLISTS?\n\n  DHCD has Tenant Selection Regulations for public housing\n\neffective as of October, 1986.\n These prescribe the way housing authorities are required to select\n\ntenants for state funded housing.\n\n\n  Tenants are to be selected in chronological order, on a first\n\ncome, first served basis, within priority and preference categories, such as\n\nfor families or individuals who are victims of fire, floods, or natural\n\ndisasters.\n\n  The regulations contain provisions for emergency access for\n\nhomeless individuals and families, in certain circumstances, to state-funded\n\nhousing.\n\n\n  The regulations establish affirmative action requirements for\n\nthose communities in which minorities are currently under-represented in the\n\nhousing authority 's state-funded housing programs.\n The regulations require those housing authorities to establish\n\naffirmative action placement rates for minority applicants.\n\n  The regulations provide preference for veterans for admission to\n\nChapter 200 Veterans Housing or for Chapter 705 Family Housing when no\n\nChapter 200 housing exists in the particular community.\n\n  The regulations allow preference for local residents of a given\n\ncommunity.\n This does not affect local preference being given provided that the\n\nhousing authority provides access to minority families in accordance with its\n\naffirmative action goal. \n\n  For more detailed information on these regulations you should\n\ncontact your local housing authority.\n\n  A list of all authorities administering public housing programs\n\nin Massachusetts is provided in this handbook starting on page 11.\n WHAT TYPE OF HOUSING IS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL\n\nNEEDS?\n\n  Most LHAs have some units in their elderly developments that were\n\nbuilt to conform with Architectural Access Board standards of accessibility.\n LHAs also have some units in family housing with limited\n\naccessibility features.\n Be sure to note on your application whether you require certain\n\ndesign features in a unit.\n\n  People with physical or mental disabilities are eligible for\n\nspecial housing programs as long as the eligibility requirements established\n\nin the regulations are met.\n Applicants with disabilities are then placed on the Elderly-\n\nHandicapped waiting list.\n State housing programs for the disabled are referred to as Chapter\n\n689.\n Units may also be available in Chapter 667 and Chapter 705\n\ndevelopments.\n\n\n  In addition to public housing, there are other types of\n\nsubsidized housing developments.\n These housing complexes are owned and managed by private companies\n\naround the state.\n Some developments may have subsidies attached to only a certain\n\npercentage of their units, others may have all their units subsidized.\n\n  Like public housing developments, these apartment complexes can\n\nbe large or small, built on one site or scattered on different sites.\n\n\n  These various housing developments have no one particular name.\n They may be financed through the Massachusetts Housing Finance\n\nAgency, the Farmers Home Administration ( in rural areas), or through a\n\nprivate bank or a community development agency.\n A list of properties that include some of these programs can be\n\nobtained by calling the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency at ( 617)\n\n854-1000.\n\n  You should also check your local, regional and community\n\nnewspapers for apartments for rent or for SRO/single rooms for rent.\n\n\n  There are maximum income limits according to family size, which\n\ngovern these subsidy programs.\n These income limits vary by the type of program and they may or may\n\nnot be the same limits that apply to public housing.\n You may be eligible for one program, but not another.\n In general, the income limits of these programs are very similar to\n\npublic housing.\n You should contact the management office of the development to\n\nreceive more information.\n The list available from MHFA will provide the names of subsidized\n\ndevelopments and designate whether they are family, elderly or mixed units,\n\ntheir locations, and the management agent 's telephone numbers.\n\n\n  There are some rental assistance subsidies which are not attached\n\nto a specific unit or development.\n Eligible applicants are issued a rent certificate or voucher and then\n\nthey must locate their own apartment in the private rental market.\n\n\n  The most widely used rental assistance program is the Section 8\n\nExisting Program which is funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\n\nDevelopment ( HUD).\n In this program, you pay no more than 30% of your adjusted gross\n\nmonthly income for rent, and%the Section 8 subsidy pays the difference\n\nbetween that amount and the full rent for the apartment.\n The total housing costs cannot be higher than the maximum rent limits\n\nset by HUD, called Fair Market Rents ( FMRs), for the size of the apartment.\n In addition to the rent limits, the apartment must meet basic housing\n\nquality standards and pass inspection by housing agency inspectors.\n\n  Another form of rental assistance funded by HUD is the Section 8\n\nVoucher Program.\n The difference between certificates and vouchers is that there is no\n\nmaximum rent set by HUD on the Voucher Program; the tenant may choose to rent\n\nany apartment, regardless of how much rent is being charged provided that the\n\nrent is reasonable as determined by the housing agency.\n However, the housing agency determines the subsidy amount the tenant\n\nis entitled to receive based on a payment standard established for the\n\nfamily 's size.\n This amount is fixed and the tenant must pay the difference between\n\nthe subsidy amount and the rent which can be more or less than 30% of the\n\ntenant 's income.\n\n  The Department of Housing and Community Development administers\n\na Section 8 program funded by HUD and a state rental assistance program (\n\nformerly the Chapter 707 Program) called the Massachusetts Rental Voucher\n\nProgram ( MRVP) funded by the Massachusetts legislature.\n The MRVP program is similar to HUD 's Section 8 Voucher Program.\n The subsidy amount is based on geographic location, family income,\n\nand the number of bedrooms needed for the household. \n WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE SECTION 8 PROGRAM, OR THE MASSACHUSETTS\n\nRENTAL VOUCHER PROGRAM?\n\n  Like public housing, there are different income limits,\n\ndetermined by your household size and the geographic location of your current\n\nresidence.\n Under the Section 8 Program the maximum income in 1996 in the Boston\n\narea ranged from\n\n&dollar;19,800 for a single person household to\n\n&dollar;28,250 for a family of four and more ` for larger families.\n For some parts of the state the maximum income limits are somewhat\n\nlower.\n The income limits for the Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program (\n\nMRVP) are the same throughout the state, which in 1996 ranged from\n\n&dollar;15,480 for a single person household to\n\n&dollar;31,200 for a family of four.\n These limits increase for larger families.\n In most cases the MRVP program provides a flat grant amount towards\n\nyour rent depending on income and the bedroom size required.\n With a flat grant subsidy, the tenant must pay the difference\n\nbetween the subsidy amount and the rent charged by the owner.\n The amount of the MRVP voucher is determined by income categories in\n\nincrements of\n\n&dollar;1,500, ( i.e. 0-&dollar;1499;\n\n&dollar;1500-1599;\n\n&dollar;1600-1699, etc.), geographic location and bedroom size.\n\n  For the one third of the MRVP Program which is project-based (\n\nthe subsidies are attached to specific units), the tenant share is either 35%\n\nof income if heat is included, or 30% of income if it is not.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b4d75a83-8cc8-493e-a229-233bd39b621e", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.808708+00:00"}
{"text": "His knees are bent and his arm curls beneath his head as he \" goes\n\nto the ground.\"\n \" Bueno?\" he asks; \" Is this alright?\" \" Yes.\"\n He does moforibale to show his respect to the oricha that he has just\n\nreceived and to the oricha that \" lives\" in his godfather 's head.\n His godfather touches his shoulders with his fingers and helps him up.\n The aleyo crosses his arms across his chest and is drawn to his\n\nelder 's cheek, first on one side and then on the other.\n .\" ( Lu. and\n\nSp. \" Saint, Oricha, Peace,\").\n This gesture is repeated as he greets all of his elders and receives\n\ntheir blessings.\n\n\n  A young man in an Eastern city of the United States enters a new\n\nreligious community; he is receiving a group of important deities and\n\nentering into fictive kin relationships with his initiators.\n He must have his head washed and his body cleaned by animals, and\n\nmust perform the moforibale; to enter this tradition, he uses his body in\n\nways that are new to him.\n As he receives the gods, he learns new patterns of body use.\n The creation of these new bodily patterns in the Guerreros initiation\n\nritual presents an interesting case: The signs used in the ritual have\n\nmeanings that can be communicated verbally, but here the signs are\n\nexperientially apprehended through the body; they are not simply understood\n\nbut are also enacted. \n\n  In recent years, studies of cultural performances have\n\ndemonstrated clearly that meaning is not latent in ritual signs and awaiting\n\ndiscovery; instead people involved in ritual performances engage signs and\n\nactivate them ( Schieffelin 1985:107).\n Through performance, people communicate cultural meanings; by\n\nemploying the various culturally relevant and available communicative\n\nresources, including specific generic and gestural forms, people produce\n\ntheir culture.\n This production takes place in all cultured behavior, and ritual--any\n\nritual--effectively opens the door to understanding the entire culture ( V.\n\nTurner 1967).6\n Cultural performances \" are occasions in which as a culture or\n\nsociety we reflect upon and define ourselves, dramatize our collective myths\n\nand history...\" ( MacAloon 1984a:1).\n Although communicative resources such as ritual do carry specific\n\nexpectations for all involved, only through enactment and negotiation can\n\nmeaning be established and understood.\n As Richard Bauman has written: Performance, like all human activity,\n\nis situated, its form, meaning, and functions rooted in culturally defined\n\nscenes or events-bounded segments of the flow of behavior and experience chat\n\nconstitute meaningful contexts for action, interpretation, and evaluation [\n\n1986:31] \n\n  Cultural performances--performances of cultural forms--can only\n\nhave meaning and functions when enacted ( Abrahams 1977:95), and enactments\n\noften produce heightened experiences for participants. \n\n  Because this initiate, whom I will call George Carter, was not\n\nborn into Santeria, these experiences are new to him.\n These new bodily activities, quite common to the tradition, represent\n\na change for Carter.\n To enter the tradition fully, he must learn to use his body in new\n\nways; he must master certain gestures and series of actions.\n As he experiences himself enacting new gestures and cultural forms of\n\nbehavior, he realizes that his body is both a sign communicating meanings in\n\na new way and simultaneously a locus of new experiences ( Cowan 1990:4; cf.\n\nB. Turner 1984:1).\n His body is not simply a constructed sign that links him to the\n\ngroup; instead, the individual 's body mediates all of the ritual signs, for\n\nhe can only act by employing his body ( Douglas 1978:87; cf. Ekman 1977).\n The enacting of these forms by the body represents the \" modes of\n\nconstruction\" of a culturally specific and useful body ( Feher 1989:11).\n Carter needs to be able to enact each of the three gestures that I\n\nwill explore in order to enter the religion more fully.\n experience the importance of his\n\nhead, he must learn the detailed gestures of sacrifice, and he must show\n\nrespect by prostrating himself in front of his elders.\n Carter learns to be a part of the community by using his body in\n\nspecific ways. \n\n  This initiation ritual begins the establishment of new \" habitual\n\nbody sets, patterns of practical activity, and forms of consciousness\" (\n\nJackson 1989:119-120).\n The activities of the ritual and the meanings therein are\n\ninseparable.\n In social action, an essential communicative form in Santeria,\n\npragmatic and semantic dimensions fuse; ideology is not an explicit discourse\n\nbut an embodied, lived experience ( Comaroff 1985:5).\n Because meaning merges with actions, the ritual represents the\n\ncreation of a new  habitus  in the initiate; it is an enactment of\n\nsome of the \" principles of the generation and structuring of practices and\n\nrepresentations\" ( Bourdieu 1989[1977]:72).\n Practitioners do provide detailed evaluations of social actions and\n\nceremonies.\n ( Sp. beautiful), and\n\nthis choice of language suggests that the sought-after quality is aesthetic\n\nand nonanalytical.\n The manipulation of physical objects--those used on altars and in\n\nsacrifices, as well as bodies-produce the elusive but beautiful ceremony.7\n\n\n\n  This habitus represents a new historical position for the\n\nneophyte in the case described above.\n This ritual is an important initiation on the road to the priesthood;\n\nit creates new bodily patterns for the initiate and thus inscribes the body\n\ninto the new discourse.\n Previously abstract verbal knowledge is enacted and incorporated.\n Never before has he had his head washed in omiero; never before has\n\nhe been cleaned by the sweepings of birds' wings; never before has he\n\nperformed the moforibale.\n The giving and receiving of the Guerreros. repeated many times and in\n\nmany places each year, assimilates people more fully into the community and\n\ngives them limited access to the supernatural world, and this example is no\n\ndifferent.\n Here, however, the medium for assimilation is Carter.\n\n\n  This embodiment of tradition in the ritual context structures\n\nCarter 's experience.\n As he uses his body in new ways and places it in new positions, he\n\nmakes physical certain relationships and experiences them bodily; the\n\ninitiation, then, regulates experience \" through its capacity to reorganize\n\nthe actor 's experience of the situation\" ( Munn 1973:605).\n In spite of the fact that initiations vary according to the\n\nperformers involved and that these variations affect the structure of the\n\nritual ( Hanks 1984:131), the aleyo 's body always structures the experience.\n\n\n\n  In Santeria, the teaching of ritual skills and moral behavior\n\nhappens informally and nonverbally; thus embodiment is especially important.\n Ritual elders tire quickly of answering questions and suggest that\n\nthe best method of learning is involvement.\n By paying attention and attending many rituals, an aleyo becomes\n\nknown as  serio  ( Sp. a serious student of the religion; see\n\nFriedman 1982) People learn this religion not through the exegesis of\n\nimportant concepts but primarily through observation and enactment.\n Since learning centers on practice and entering actively into this\n\ntradition, the body naturally emerges as central to any analysis of this kind\n\nof ritual ( cf. Wafer @991).\n This learning takes place slowly, and so it is extremely difficult to\n\ndocument.\n I have focused here on the body but it exists in a complex\n\nrelationship with social knowledge and interpretation.\n The informal learning style of Santeria makes social knowledge a kind\n\nof esoteric power.\n People who know certain ceremonies exercise power in the community.\n My analysis reflects the social realities of this community.\n Ritual focuses on the body and its manipulation, and personal\n\nexperience represents the primary method for understanding.\n When a practitioner integrates experience with more commonly held,\n\nculturally produced expressive forms, like divination stories, social\n\nknowledge is expanded.\n which defines\n\npractical mastery is transmitted in practice...without attaining the level of\n\ndiscourse\" ( Bourdieu 1989[1977]:87).\n Carter clearly grasps this emphasis on practice and the use of the\n\nbody: \n\n  Although I had never done too much in Santeria before, I...I\n\nguess I wanted to be part of the community which I was joining, to act like\n\nthey do.\n I wanted to be involved and do what they did so I would learn the\n\nreligion. \n\n  Involvement must be physical to be complete; although Carter\n\nknows a great deal about the beliefs and sacred stories of Santeria, he\n\ngreatly values entering the habitus of the community and expects to learn\n\nfrom his experience. \n\n\n  Because no expressive body activity happens without real bodies\n\nand no meanings can be assigned to gestures without reference to an\n\nhistorically specific event ( Poole 1975:101), the specific example at hand\n\nbest reveals Carter 's bodily practice.\n The community of ritual specialists washes Carter 's head as he\n\nprepares to enter the community.\n He leans over with eyes closed to receive their attention and\n\nblessings.\n The herbal mixture \" cools\" and \" refreshes\" him.\n His head is washed over a basin and then again in the bathtub.\n Each time, the padrino rubs the omiero, and the herbs floating in it,\n\ninto his skin and scalp. \n\n  In the bathroom cleansing, which I have witnessed many times, the\n\ngestures of the ritual are highly stylized.\n The aleyo leans over the tub and places the chest on the edge; the\n\nhands rest on the bottom, one on top of the other.\n I have seen this priest, whom I will call Jose, demonstrate to people\n\nhow they should position themselves as they receive the  despojo  (\n\nSp. cleaning).\n Through this instruction in how properly to perform the gesture, Jose\n\nshows that he has an aesthetic by which he evaluates it.\n Similarly, Jose washes the head with a specific pattern of movements.\n He takes the omiero from its basin in a small gourd and pours it\n\nfirst over the crown of the head and then over the neck.\n Again starting at the crown, he lathers the soap by moving it around\n\nthe head in growing circles until he reaches the neck, which he scrubs\n\nvigorously.\n He then rinses the head with more omiero and squeezes the water from\n\nthe hair with a motion similar to the one with which he lathers it.\n These highly stylized gestures reveal a culturally structured pattern\n\nof bodily movement, and although they are performed by the padrino, they\n\nsuggest that the despojo does contain gestures that the aleyo learns and\n\nexperiences through his body. \n\n  The head, which receives most of the attention in the cleaning,\n\ncarries complex and multiple symbolic meanings in Santeria.\n ,\n\nis the spiritual faculty and central being of a human ( Murphy 1981:287)\n\nBefore birth, each ori goes before the Creator and receives its essential\n\ncharacter.\n This character, which people closely associate with an individual 's\n\ndestiny, can be either \" hot\" or \" cool\" ( Cabrea 1980:121).\n While practitioners disagree about how mutable the head as character\n\nis, the ritual washing here in refreshing herbs and water helps to cool a hot\n\nhead.\n The head also idiomatically refers to the oricha that rules a person;\n\nan individual and the deity also establish this relationship in front of the\n\nCreator before birth ( see Bascom 1991:115).  </i>\n\n  This central deity, often called \" the owner of the head,\"\n\nrepresents an important part of the individual 's character.\n For example, the white, calm, and generous oricha Obatala rules the\n\nhead of Carter 's padrino, and so people assume that Jose is slow to anger,\n\nrelatively intellectual, benevolent, and, others might add, \" big-headed.\"8\n In fact, at times practitioners confuse the \" owner of the head\" and\n\nthe individual; \" an Obatala\" refers to a child of Obatala and in ritual may\n\nact in the role of that oricha.\n The eleda can be identified through various divination systems, and a\n\ngrowing relationship between an individual and the eleda often leads to\n\ninitiations, after which the  ache  ( Lu. power. essence) of the\n\noricha literally resides inside the initiate 's head; after a full initiation,\n\nthe oricha can \" mount\" the initiate in trance possession and thus take\n\ncontrol of the body that they share.9 \n\n \n\noloricha  ( Lu. priests), cleans and refreshes his head.\n Thus, the ritual attention to the head marks it as socially and\n\nreligiously important.\n The omiero is both an empowering and a cleaning agent; when applied\n\nto the head, it strengthens the spirit that dwells of the mixture, entwined\n\nin his hair, often begin to scratch and cause itching Carter recalls: \n\n  I felt a little estrange scratching my head after Jose [ his\n\ngodfather]had spent so much time attending to it.\n He prayed and I scratched; it...it seemed so...so strange to treat\n\nwhat had been made sacred as something annoying, but my scalp really itched.\n Later, I said a prayer to my head [ ruling oricha] in thanksgiving\n\nand slept with a white cloth over it.10 \n\n  He pays special and prolonged attention to his head; this\n\nattention, focused on his body and the part of it representing his destiny,\n\nlasts through the ritual and beyond.\n The man attends to his head and thus experiences its cultural\n\nimportance in a bodily way. \n\n  This attention to the head, moreover, represents the beginning of\n\na new cultural pattern.\n Many culturally prescribed forms of behavior, which specific other\n\nmembers of the religious community validate and encourage, reiterate the\n\ncentrality of the head.\n People entering Santeria often start their affiliation when they need\n\nhealing, and frequently the first ritual they undergo is the  rogacion de\n\nla cabeza  , in which coconut, water, and cotton are applied to the head\n\nto feed it.\n If they eventually undergo initiation and they almost always do (\n\nRogers 1@73:28-29)--their heads will receive still more attention.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "13c7d4a1-b1ed-4e27-8ac0-86d2e53f0c46", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.810145+00:00"}

an article from a serial publication, please\n\nmatch the serial title with the volume number, date of issue, and place of\n\npublication.\n Be sure to include pagination, title, and author of the article.\n To request a newspaper, be sure to include the dates and place of\n\npublication. \n\n\n  Many items in microfilm and microfiche formats are available for\n\nloan.\n Although LC does not circulate original copies of items published\n\nbefore 1801, genealogies, or bound periodicals, this material will circulate\n\nas microfilm. \n\n\n  LC does not circulate dissertations on microfilm that are readily\n\navailable from a commercial source. \n\n\n  The Library of Congress maintains a collection of over 900,000\n\nserial titles, including bound volumes, loose issues, and microfilm.\n Periodicals, whether bound or unbound, are non-circulating, but the\n\nLoan Division makes every effort to send gratis photocopies of individual\n\narticles when requested on interlibrary loan.\n Photocopied material is mailed first class or sent by Ariel when the\n\nIP address is provided. \n\n\n  The Library of Congress maintains one of the largest and most\n\ncomprehensive newspaper collections in the world, comprised not only of the\n\nmajor papers published in all 50 states and territories of the United States,\n\nbut also those published in other countries of the world and their internal\n\nstates and subdivisions that have existed during the past three centuries.\n Almost all of the more than 500,000 reels of newspaper microfilm held\n\nby the Newspaper & Current Periodical, European, Asian, and African & Middle\n\nEastern Divisions are available for interlibrary loan.\n Only newspapers that have been microfilmed are available for\n\nloan.\n\n\n  In the LC cataloging record, check the call number ( 050) field\n\nin the bibliographic record.\n If the word \" newspaper\" appears here, or \" newspaper\" plus a number\n\nsmaller than 5000 ( Newspaper 3450), the film should be available for loan.\n If the call number field includes an X ( Newspaper 8066-X), or a\n\nnumber larger than 5000 ( Newspaper 7686), then the newspaper is not on\n\nmicrofilm and is non-circulating.\n Up to 6 reels may be borrowed per patron at one time.\n Please be sure to include a place of publication and the exact dates\n\nthat you are requesting.\n\n  Loan Division is unable to provide copies of specific articles\n\nfrom non-circulating microfilmed or bound newspapers.\n Requests for photocopies from non-circulating newspapers should be\n\nsent directly to the library. \n\n  For further information on newspapers at the Library of Congress,\n\nNewspaper and Current Periodical Reading Room. \n\n\n  In addition to its general book and periodical collection, the\n\nLibrary of Congress maintains a number of specialized collections, some large\n\nenough to be custodial units in their own right, some small enough to be\n\nsubsets of other collections.\n The links included here are designed to guide the potential borrower\n\nto information about these materials and the procedures for identifying and\n\nborrowing or requesting copies of specific items. \n\n\n  Most monographs in the Law Library are available for loan.\n Loose-leaf materials, serials, serial sets, and material in micro\n\nformat and microprint form are all non-circulating.\n Loan Division will provide complimentary copies of articles and other\n\nmaterial whenever possible.\n For more information about legal materials at the Library of\n\nCongress, see the Law Library. \n\n\n  All items in these collections are non-circulating.\n Loan Division will provide, whenever possible, a complimentary\n\nphotocopy of a few pages.\n For further information on these collections, see the Rare Books and\n\nSpecial Collections Reading Room . \n\n\n  Many collections have been microfilmed as part of the Library 's\n\nPreservation Microfilming Program and are available for interlibrary loan\n\nboth from LC and from other research libraries.\n Manuscripts on microfilm may be requested through the Loan Division\n\nas regular interlibrary loans.\n In some cases the Manuscript Division does not lend microfilm of\n\ncollections which are stored offsite or for which there are no master\n\nnegatives.\n Please note that the Division allows only 10 reels per patron at one\n\ntime to be sent out on interlibrary loan.\n For further information about these collections, see the Manuscript\n\nDivision Reading Room. \n\n\n  Please note that this material is non-circulating.\n Loan Division is only able to provide photocopies of U.S. technical\n\nreports.\n\n\n\n  All Library of Congress holdings for the National Translation\n\nCenter have been transferred to the Canada Institute for Scientific and\n\nTechnical Information in Ottawa, Canada.\n This material can be obtained from CISTI by using the OCLC ILL\n\nsub-system.\n Their OCLC symbol is ( CAI).\n\n\n\n  Since 1979, the Library of Congress has received a full\n\ndepository set of U.S. government publications in multiple formats.\n Many, but not all, government publications issued before 1979 are\n\nalso available from the Library since they are part of the general\n\ncollection.\n For basic information about U.S. government publications, please\n\nclick here to view the home

future date requests for CIP, Not on\n\nShelf, Lack, and In Process items.\n\n  The Loan Division does not photocopy articles from newspapers in\n\nany format.\n\n  Allow a minimum of two weeks for most monograph and journal\n\narticle requests and a month, or more, for newspaper and serial microfilms,\n\nmusic items, maps, Near Eastern materials, or other requests that must be\n\ntransferred to

{"text": "Oddly enough, though Charles Darwin stood the scientific world on\n\nend by what he found by going to sea 135 years ago, subsequent tinkerers in\n\nevolutionary theory have been largely landlubbers.\n Virtually ignoring seven-tenths of our planet 's surface, such\n\ninvestigators focused on land-locked fossil records, establishing evolution 's\n\nhallowed grounds in the plains of East Africa and the Middle East.\n\n  Surely a lack of sophistication in sea-faring technology accounts\n\nfor much of the land-based research effort, although effective deep-sea\n\ntrawling and sampling devices were in use by scientists in Darwin 's day.\n But even with the advent of powerful sonar gear and deep-ocean\n\ndrilling techniques in the 1950s, evolutionists' attention remained largely\n\nriveted on dusty fragments gleaned from the world 's remote hillsides.\n\n  In recent years, however, scientists began revisiting the oceans,\n\ncurious about how certain sea fossils fit models of evolutionary theory\n\nsynthesized almost entirely from scattered, often puzzling evidence recovered\n\nfrom dry land.\n Some intriguing results turned up recently in the laboratories of two\n\nFlorida State University ( FSU) marine paleontologists.\n\n  Tony Arnold and Bill Parker compiled what may be the largest, most\n\ncomplete set of data on the evolutionary history of any group of organisms,\n\nmarine or otherwise.\n The two scientists amassed something that their land-based colleagues\n\nonly dreamed about: An intact fossil record with no missing links.\n\n  \" It 's all here-a virtually complete evolutionary record,\" says\n\nArnold.\n \" There are other good examples, but this is by far the best.\n We're seeing the who 'repicture of how this group of organisms has\n\nchanged throughout most of its existence on Earth.\"\n\n  The organism that Arnold and Parker study is a single- celled,\n\nmicroscopic animal belonging to the Foraminiferida, an order of hard-shelled,\n\nplanktonic marine protozoans.\n Often shortened to \" forams,\" the name comes from the Latin word\n\n foramen  , or \" opening.\"\n The organisms can be likened to amoebas wearing shells, with\n\nperforations through which their protoplasm extends.\n\n\n  Tropical and subtropical seas around the globe abound with\n\nforams, which are divided into two general types: The free- floating,\n\nplanktonic form that is uniformly small ( usually less than a 5Oth of an inch\n\nlong) and the benthic or bottom-dwelling variety that is typically much\n\nlarger.\n The latter type is perhaps best remembered by Earth-science students\n\nor by spelunkers who commonly find the fossils imbedded in cave walls.\n The ancient Egyptians used limestone blocks containing the large,\n\nextinct  Nummulites  to build the tops of some Giza pyramids.\n\n  But it 's the planktonic variety that chiefly interests Parker and\n\nArnold.\n Unlike their oversized cousins, free-swimming forams are found almost\n\neverywhere in the oceans.\n Their fossilized skeletons, in fact, were among some of the first\n\nbiological material recovered from deep ocean bottoms by scientists in the\n\n1850s.\n For nearly a century, geologists have used the tiny fossils to help\n\nestablish the age of sediments and to gain insight into prehistoric\n\nclimates.\n\n  Only since the early 1960s, though, have scientists begun to\n\nfully appreciate fossil forams' potential as a tool for use in evolutionary\n\nstudies and a host of Earth sciences as well.\n Advanced deep-sea drilling techniques, combined with computer-\n\nassisted analytical tools, have ushered in a whole new vista of foram\n\nresearch.\n Arnold and Parker are among the first scientists to harness\n\nsophisticated technology to a foram project for the express purpose of\n\nstudying evolution.\n\n  In 1980, Arnold successfully married computers with optical\n\ndevices to create an efficient, precise way to analyze foram fossils.\n Before the technique was developed, the field was represented only by\n\na few extraordinarily dedicated individuals who spent countless hours over\n\nmicroscopes, sorting and analyzing the sand-grain-sized shells virtually by\n\nhand.\n\n  The apparatus Arnold and Parker now use combines the latest in\n\nvideo technology with their specially programmed computer.\n Although it requires an operator, the system is the fastest, most\n\nreliable means of foram identification and classification available.\n It soon will become far more powerful if its developers succeed in\n\nlinking it with a scanning electron microscope.\n\n  \" There 's a nifty passage in Darwin.\" says Arnold, \" in which he\n\ndescribes the fossil record as a library with only a few books, and each book\n\nhas only a few chapters.\n The chapters have only a few words, and the words are missing\n\nletters.\"\n\n  \" Well, in this case, we've got a relativ 've complete library,\"\n\nsays Arnold.\n \" The ` books' are in excellent shape.\n\n\n  As he speaks, Arnold shows a series of microphotographs,\n\ndepicting the evolutionary change wrought on a single foram species.\n \" This is the same organism, as it existed through 500,OOO years,\" he\n\nsays.\n \" We've got hundreds 'veexamples like this, complete life and\n\nevolutionary histories for dozens of species.\"\n\n  About 330 species of living and extinct planktonic forams have\n\nbeen classified so far.\n After thorough examinations of marine sediments collected from around\n\nthe world, micropaleontologists now suspect these are just about all the\n\nfree- floating forams that ever existed.\n\n  The species collection also is exceptionally well-preserved,\n\nwhich accounts largely for the excitement shared by Parker and Arnold.\n \" Most fossils, particularly those of the vertebrates, are\n\nfragmented-just odd and ends,\" says Parker.\n \" But these fossils are almost perfectly preserved, despite being\n\nmillions of years old.\" \n\n  By being so small, the fossil shells escaped nature 's grinding\n\nand crushing forces, which over the eons have in fact destroyed most evidence\n\nof life on Earth.\n The extraordinary condition of the shells permits the paleontologists\n\nto study in detail not only how a whole species develops, but how individual\n\nanimals develop from birth to adulthood.\n\n  The resulting data base thus holds unprecedented power for\n\nevolutionary studies, says Arnold.\n Not only can he and Parker use it to describe how evolution has\n\nworked in a particular species, but they can use it as a standard for testing\n\nevolutionary theories, which are growing in number.\n\n  \" Scientists are overflowing with ideas on the laws of evolution,\n\nor principles of evolutionary change, but most of them are simply untestable\n\nbecause of the poor fossil record,\" says Arnold, \" And unless they can be\n\nscientifically tested, theories don't really amount to much.\n So, what we have here is a wonderful opportunity to test a lot of\n\nthese ideas quantita- tively.\n yes\n\n , this or that happens in the forams or  no  , it doesn't.\"\n\n\n\n  Some biologists have long suspected that the evolutionary process\n\nworks differently, although within certain principles, among different\n\nspecies.\n In other words, what may be true for evolution in mammals may not be\n\ntrue in mollusks.\n\n  The forams may not be representative of all organisms but, at\n\nleast in this group, we can actually see how evolution happened,\" says\n\nParker.\n \" We can see transitions from one species to another.\n rare observation.\"\n\n  Had Darwin been able to examine the fossil record of forams, he\n\ncould have fortified many of his arguments on how new species come into\n\nbeing, and perhaps eased a nagging worry about the terribly incomplete fossil\n\nrecord yielded by terrestrial research.\n\n  As for the origin of species, the famous naturalist always held\n\nthat new plants and animals arise from unstable varieties sprung off from old\n\nspecies.\n Competition among varieties and their abilities to withstand\n\nenvironmental pressures eventually lead to populations that are so profoundly\n\ndifferent that they become reproductively incompatible with populations other\n\nthan themselves.\n\n\n  , a theory that\n\ninvokes the slow accumulation of small evolutionary changes over a large\n\nperiod of time, as a result of the pressures of natural selection.\n What Arnold and Parker found is almost a textbook example of\n\ngradualism at work.\n\n  We've literally 'ven hundreds of speciation events,\" says Arnold.\n This allows us to check for patterns, to determine what exactly is\n\ngoing on.\n We can quickly tell whether something is a recurring phenomenon-a\n\npattern-or whether it 's just an anomaly.\n This way, we cannot only look for the same things that have been\n\nobserved in living organisms, but we can see just how often these things\n\nreally happen in the environment over an enormous period of time.\" \n\n  Such a revelation flies in the face of latter-day rethinking of\n\nDarwinian evolution, which during the past 20 years has tended to gravitate\n\ntoward a new theory called  punctuated equilibrium  .\n First postulated in the early 1970s by paleontologists Niles Eldredge\n\nand Stephen J. Gould, this idea refutes gradualism 's central premise that\n\ngreat amounts of time are necessary to create new species.\n\n  Punctuated equilibrium holds that new species may arise fairly\n\nquickly ( over thousands instead of millions of years) from small animal\n\npopulations that somehow become isolated.\n Intermediate stages are too fleeting to become fixed in the fossil\n\nrecord-thus the conspicuous gaps or so-called missing links.\n ( Darwin blamed the \" imperfection in the geological record\" for the\n\ngaps in the fossil record.) \n\n  But in the near-perfect record exhibited by the forams studied at\n\nFSU, the highly touted Eldredge-Gould theory of punctuated equilibrium\n\napparently doesn't work.\n The record reveals a robust, highly branched evolutionary tree,\n\ncomplete with Darwin 's predicted \" dead ends\"-varieties that lead nowhere-\n\nand-a profusion of variability in sizes and body shapes.\n Transitional forms between species are readily apparent, making it\n\nrelatively easy to track ancestor species to their descendants.\n In short, the finding upholds Darwin 's lifelong conviction that \"\n\nnature does not proceed in leaps,\" but rather is a system perpetually\n\nunfolding in extreme slow motion.\n\n  In the hands of less scrupulous observers, the foram record may\n\nhave been construed to  support  Gould 's hypothesis about the\n\nsuddenness of speciation.\n Darwin would have been shocked to find out just how fast the great\n\nfamily of forams churns out new species, says Parker.\n Through dating analysis, he and his colleague showed that the forams\n\ncould produce a whole new species in as little as 200,000 years-speedy by\n\nDarwinian standards.\n \" But as fast as this is, it 's still far too slow to be classed as\n\npunctuational,\" says Arnold.\n\n  Other curiosities are beginning to emerge from the probe into the\n\nforams' past.\n One finding is being described-perhaps too hastily-as disproving\n\nCope 's Rule, named for its synthesis by American paleontologist Edward\n\nDrinker Cope.\n His time-honored evolutionary principle basically holds that, within\n\na group, animals tend to start out small and increase in size over time.\n\n  \" We've fou 'veout that apparently, lineages don't exactly work\n\nthat way,\" says Arnold.\n \" Many of the forams start out small, and essentially stay that way\n\nuntil extinction.\n Others do manage to wander into dramatically larger sizes, but\n\nthey're th 'reare ones.\" \n\n  This find doesn't necessarily contradict what Cope said, only\n\nwhat many scientists  think  he said, says Parker.\n \" Cope 's observation was simply that there are a few extremely large\n\nexamples ( of individuals) in any given lineage, and these examples always\n\noccur at the later stages of the organism 's development.\n And that 's apparently true.\n But our findings show that the vast majority of forams start small\n\nand end small, even though the mean size increases somewhat due to a few very\n\nlarge specimens.\n As you get more and more species evolving, some of them eventually\n\nmanage to get moderately to very large, but most of them don't increase in\n\nsize at all.\"\n\n  It may be in what the foram record suggests about how life copes\n\nwith mass annihilation that eventually draws the most attention to the FSU\n\npaleontologists' work.\n The geologic record has been prominently scarred by a series of\n\nglobal cataclysms of unknown, yet hotly debated, origin.\n Each event, whether rapid or slow, wreaked wholesale carnage on\n\nEarth 's ecology, wiping out countless species that had taken nature millions\n\nof years to produce.\n Biologists have always wondered how life bounces back after such\n\nsweeping devastation.\n\n  One of the last great extinctions occurred roughly 66 million\n\nyears ago and, according to one popular theory, it resulted from Earth 's\n\nreceiving a direct hit from a large asteroid.\n\n\ncoup de grace  , and also wiped out a good portion of the marine\n\nlife-including almost all species of planktonic forams.\n\n  This period of massive death, which ended the Cretaceous Period,\n\nushered in the modern chapter of biological development.\n Earth entered the new era, the Cenozoic, with a wide range of\n\necosystems virtually devoid of life ( and thus competition between species),\n\nyet quite fertile and primed for repopulation.\n\n  Some observers, perhaps following Darwin 's lead, have envisioned\n\na sedate repopulation sequence, with speciation occurring at an immensely\n\nslow rate.\n None of the species die off until their numbers begin to saturate the\n\nenvironment, exhausting its capacity to sustain such proliferation of\n\nlife.\n\n  Other scientists have theorized, but never been able to\n\ndemonstrate, that in the absence of competition, an explosion of life takes\n\nplace.\n The evolution of new species greatly accelerates, and a profusion of\n\nbody shapes and sizes bursts across the horizon, filling up vacant spaces\n\nlike weeds overtaking a pristine lawn.\n An array of new forms fans out into these limited niches where\n\ncrowding soon forces most of the new forms to spin out into oblivion similar\n\nto sparks from a bonfire.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "The pipeline for geoscience professionals, men and women, begins\n\nwell before the first employment and before the first undergraduate college\n\ncourse.\n It begins some time during pre-college education.\n Motivation supporting the choice of geoscience as a career varies from\n\nrocks, fossils, and other collectibles gathered in childhood exploration, to\n\nfascination with abstract concepts of Earth, such as the K/T boundary, plate\n\ntectonics and global-climate change.\nTo develop that\n\ngleam of interest in earth science into a career, those elements or concepts\n\nmust be polished by formal training.\n But even at the middle- or junior-high level, when most earth-science\n\ncourses are taught, only 23 percent of students are exposed at all to earth\n\nscience in their academic curriculum.\n So the problems experienced by women students begin with the dearth of\n\npre-college experiences in earth science.\n Females face more problems because they experience science education\n\nin a negative learning environment that may result in diminished self-esteem\n\nand minimal opportunities for experiencing positive role-models.\n\nStudies on the classroom environment have led many researchers to support the\n\nthesis that classroom socialization has a significant impact on the\n\nself-esteem of students.\n Problems include teacher bias against girls in selection of girls as\n\nactivity leaders, equitable treatment in question-and-answer sessions and,\n\ngenerally, in the low expectations of high-quality performance by girls in\n\nscience.\n The term\n\ngirl-friendly science describes a learning environment that supports female\n\nstudents.\n Some factors contributing to such an environment include individual\n\nand small-group activities, student-directed inquiry, cooperative rather than\n\ncompetitive student arrangements, equal access to physical tasks ( especially\n\nequipment use), and opportunities for successful learning experiences.\n The goal is for all students to be encouraged to take part, to\n\nrespond, and to encourage each other. Bud Chipman 's model indicates\n\nparticipation in higher education is affected mainly by an individual 's\n\nexpectation of success, which includes such factors as self-perceived ability\n\n( self-esteem), social stereotypes, and prior experiences.\n Chipman 's model provides a clear schematic for addressing relevant\n\nfactors to improve the educational--or professional--environment.\n\nAnother problem is the image of scientists portrayed in science textbooks.\n Surveys, even quite recent ones, show that illustrations of white\n\nmale scientists are predominant.\n Without exposure to women scientists, young women do not usually\n\nperceive themselves in that role.\n In one study of five major biology texts ( 1983 and 1985) from major\n\nU.S. publishers, illustrations of females were 30 percent, 35 percent, 34\n\npercent, 49 percent, and 32 percent of all depictions ( Kahle & Matyas,\n\n1987).\n Note that the percentage of female Ph.D. recipients in biology in\n\n1988 was 35 percent.\n That corresponds closely to the percentages of women shown in the\n\ntextbooks, perhaps a positive element for students.\n\n\nAnother analysis compares students' self-perception of their skills to their\n\ngrades.\n Girls usually perceive themselves to be less successful than their\n\nmale peers, although their grades indicate that they perform as well as or\n\nbetter than their male counterparts ( Widnall, 1988). Negative\n\nsocialization practices are also evident in graduate education, where it may\n\nhave its most clearly measured effect on the participation of women in\n\nscience.\n Although standardized text scores indicate that women have superior\n\nachievement in verbal and analytical test areas, and males have superior\n\nachievement in math, surveys indicate that women enter graduate school at a\n\nrate about equal to men relative to their participation in baccalaureate\n\ndegrees.\n The preparedness of women students is also about equal to males as\n\nshown by grade-point average.\n Yet women seem to have less success at achieving graduate degrees,\n\nparticularly doctoral degrees, despite entering the programs as well prepared\n\nas their male counterparts ( Widnall, 1988). Anecdotal surveys\n\nsuggest that this difference is the result of the poor quality of\n\ninterpersonal support of women students by faculty and by men students.\n Women indicate that they receive less information about internal\n\nprocesses, such as opportunities for financial and research support,\n\nparticipation in department meetings and informal news-sharing activities,\n\nand anecdotal information on handling qualifying exams.\n Also, women students report that they have fewer meetings with thesis\n\nadvisers, less useful feedback from faculty, fewer opportunities for\n\nresponsibility within a research group, and problems with peer acceptance in\n\nstudent networks and study groups ( Widnall, 1988).\n Many aspects of successful graduate education require mentors, since\n\nlearning the non-academic aspects of a profession is based largely in\n\nsupportive guidance. Mildred Dresselhaus, Massachusetts Institute\n\nof Technology, suggests, \" If the practices of those departments that have\n\nbeen most successful at retaining women could be adopted by those\n\nexperiencing serious problems, it should be very easy to double the number of\n\nwomen degree recipients.\n Good climates for women tend to have more women role models,\n\nwell-established equal-opportunity environments, career-development networks,\n\nand, most important, the commitment of their top officers.\"\n\n  Many of these problems also surface in the professional ranks of\n\nwomen in geoscience.\n The lack of female geoscience faculty, particularly at the\n\nfull-professor level, has been reported by Maria L. Crawford and others in\n\nseveral papers.\n Barriers for women academic professionals include many of those for\n\nwomen graduate students, but also include problems of access to promotion and\n\ntenure, minimal support for family care situations, and even questions of\n\ncredibility and quality of work, despite proven track records of research and\n\npublications ( Brush, 1991).\n Women geoscientists in other employment sectors reflect similar\n\nproblems. The chilly climate for women in science is not restricted\n\nto the geosciences, but it does seem more exaggerated.\n A recent survey of starting salaries for baccalaureate geoscientists\n\nshows that women in geoscience have the least equity in compensation ( 68\n\npercent) compared with their male counterparts and with other scientific\n\ndisciplines ( Committee on Professionals in Science and Technology,\n\n1990).\n\n Despite the high percentage of women students considering geoscience as a\n\ncareer, ( as high as 42 percent of freshman/sophomore enrollment) the number\n\nis diminished to a mere 19 percent of the doctoral degrees awarded in\n\ngeoscience.\n However, the leaky pipeline is not a hopeless fixture.\n By reinforcing support across transition points, that is, at high\n\nschool-to-college, undergraduate-to-graduate school, and graduate\n\nschool-to-professional population, much of this wasted human resource can be\n\nretained.\n The chief effort must be to improve the quality of the educational\n\nexperience.\n Improving professional opportunities is even more crucial; without\n\nthat improvement all other efforts are likely to have little\n\neffect.\n\n  Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2,1990.\n During the eight months that followed, preparing for and conducting\n\nwar in the Persian Gulf ( known by Arabs as the Arabian Gulf) region caused\n\nmuch degradation to the air, land and sea.\n Environmental impacts on the atmosphere resulted from the burning of\n\noil wells, on the Gulf water from several oil spills, and on the land from\n\ndisturbances of the desert surface. Wanton explosion of 732 oil\n\nwells resulted in oppressive pollution of the air as it carried chemicals and\n\nsoot particles, s well as droplets of unburned oil.\n Sulfur oxides combined with water to form acid rain that with other\n\nproducts increased the acidity of soils, suffocated desert plants and locally\n\ncaused severe respiratory problems to humans. Early predictions of\n\na global meteorological disaster proved wrong.\n The forecasts of a \" nuclear winter\" over Europe and the rest of the\n\nworld were not based on knowledge of the wind directions in the Gulf region.\n They also did not take into account the fact that particulates from\n\nthe burning wells are too heavy to rise to the stratosphere and spread around\n\nthe globe.\n These particulates remained mostly below 8,000 feet and did not rise\n\nmuch above 22,000 feet.\n Thus, their effects remained in the region of the Arabian Peninsula\n\nand nearby areas of northwestern India and East Africa. Thanks to\n\nunprecedented efforts of 27 teams of firefighters, the last oil-well fires\n\nwere capped in November 1991.\n However, trails of the fire plumes remain etched on the desert\n\nsurface as a deposit of soot and oil droplets up to two inches thick.\n These trails betray the prevailing wind direction of the winter and\n\nparticularly summer Shamal winds from the north/northwest. The\n\ncoastal and marine environments of the western Gulf were drastically affected\n\nby oil spills estimated at eight million barrels.\n The slow counter-clockwise water currents of the Gulf moved the oil\n\nalong the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, endangering marine life,\n\npolluting hundreds of miles of coastline and threatening water desalination\n\nplants.\n Nearly two million barrels of oil were skimmed off the Gulf water at\n\ntwo locations near Dhahran and Jubail in Saudi Arabia. As the light\n\ncomponents of oil evaporated from air exposure and the high temperature of\n\nthe Gulf water, heavy components found their way either to coastal areas or\n\nsank to the bottom.\n At the northern tip of Qatar 300 miles south of Kuwait, more than 10\n\nfeet of coastline are covered with heavy oil.\n In many places, this tarry layer was superimposed on remains of the\n\n1983oil spill that was a result of the Iran/Iraq war. Skimmed oil\n\nfrom the coastal water and beaches is stored in large pools or in heaps in\n\nthe open desert.\n One major concern is whether some of it might seep through fractures\n\nto pollute ground-water resources that are used in agriculture.\n\nEffects on the land surface of Kuwait and northeastern Saudi Arabia are even\n\nmore serious.\n In Kuwait, hundreds of oil lakes stud the desert surface.\n These were formed from wells that were destroyed but did not catch\n\nfire, as well as from burning wells that had to be kept flowing so as to cool\n\nafter the fires were put out.\n These lakes, up to eight feet deep, remain a death trap for insects\n\nand birds, emit noxious gases, and may also seep to pollute the ground\n\nwater. Changes to the contours of the land by building trenches,\n\nberms and other sand walls, and hiding places for military equipment,\n\npersonnel, and ammunition, destroyed much of the desert pavement.\n This pavement is usually a one-grain thick layer of pebbles that\n\nprotects fine-grained soil from wind action.\n The disruption of this layer resulted in whirling fine particles as\n\ndust by the Shamal winds, and the accumulation of sand-size particles into\n\ndunes.\n These dunes have already blocked roads in northern Kuwait and their\n\ncontinued movement threatens farms and other installations in the open\n\ndesert. Efforts have now begun to assess the damage to the region\n\nfrom the Gulf War and to plan environmental monitoring in the future.\n As a first step, a joint research project is being planned between\n\nBoston University and the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research to use\n\nsatellite imagery to assess the damage, followed by field confirmations.\n It is believed that although the damage to the atmosphere were\n\nshort-lived, the impact on the Gulf water may persist for decades and the\n\neffects on the desert surface may last for centuries.SYNTHETIC\n\nQUAKES MODEL FOR LONG-TERM PREDICTION\n\nLong-term earthquake prediction is one of the major goals of seismologists,\n\nlike myself.\n Long-term predictions are couched in probabilities.\n For example, \" There is a 30 percent chance of a magnitude 7 or\n\ngreater quake occurring on a certain section of a fault within the next 30\n\nyears.\"\n The staple of long-term predictions is, of course, the statistics of\n\nearthquake recur-rence. Most simply, the statistics reduce to a\n\nprobability function containing two parameters: ( formula), the mean repeat\n\ntime of a certain size quake at a given place; and ( formula), the variation\n\nof the recurrence interval about the mean.\n Naturally, forecasts developed from probability functions are only as\n\ngood as the observations that constrain their parameters.\n In the past, the observations have been restricted almost exclusively\n\nto the repetition intervals of large historical earthquakes.\n Unfortunately, well-documented repetitions rarely number more than\n\nabout five, so the fitting of even two parameters to these intervals entails\n\nconsiderable uncertainty, and confidence in the resulting prediction suffers.\n Consider the pattern of this century 's large earthquakes along the\n\nMiddle America Trench in southwest Mexico.\n From this data, imagine trying to determine(formula) or ( formula) of\n\nthe probability function controlling earthquake recurrence at any position\n\nalong the coast.\n It 's nearly impossible.\n Simply, there are not enough samples to say just how regularly or\n\nirregularly earthquakes strike. In view of the fundamental\n\nrestrictions in sampling earthquake recurrences, it seems to me that\n\nrefinements in long-term earthquake prediction will have to spring from more\n\ninnovative approaches.\n Here, computer simulation comes into play.\n Suppose that I can build a \" credible\" synthetic model of seismicity.\n If so, the sampling problem would be eliminated.\n Synthetic seismicity has an advantage over the real thing in that\n\ncomputer histories can be extended indefinitely to collect a statistically\n\nsignificant number of earthquake recurrences, whether it takes 500 computer\n\nyears, or 5,000 or 50,000. \u00ef\u00ff", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "34f973f4-4345-4148-8d97-db82f3398d78", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.840352+00:00"}
{"text": "The Home Depot, Inc., including its subsidiaries ( \" The Home\n\nDepot\" or \" Company\") is the leading retailer in the home improvement\n\nindustry.\n It operates \" warehouse style\" stores which sell a wide assortment of\n\nbuilding materials and home improvement products.\n At fiscal year end, the Company had 340 stores in 28 states and 3\n\nCanadian provinces, with an aggregate total of approximately 35,133,000\n\nsquare feet of selling space.\n Such stores average approximately 103,000 square feet of enclosed\n\nspace per store, with an additional 20,000 to 28,000 square feet of garden\n\ncenter and storage space.\n The Company 's corporate offices are located at 2727 Paces Ferry Road,\n\nAtlanta, Georgia 30339-4089, telephone number ( 404) 433-8211. \n\n  The Home Depot 's operating strategy stresses providing a broad\n\nrange of merchandise at competitive prices and utilizing highly knowledgeable\n\nservice oriented personnel and aggressive advertising. Company-employed\n\nshoppers regularly check prices at competitors' operations to ensure that The\n\nHome Depot 's low \" Day-In, Day-Out\" warehouse prices are competitive within\n\neach market.\n\n  Since a majority of the Company 's customers are individual\n\nhomeowners, many of whom may have limited experience in do-it-yourself ( \"\n\nD-I-Y\") projects, management considers its employees' knowledge of products\n\nand home improvement techniques and applications to be very important to its\n\nmarketing approach and its ability to maintain customer satisfaction. Many\n\nD-I-Y customers take advantage of \" how-to\" classes offered in The Home Depot\n\nstores.\n\n  Another segment of the Company 's business activity is the\n\nbuy-it-yourself ( \" B-I-Y\") customers.\n The B-I-Y customer chooses products, makes the purchase and contracts\n\nwith others to complete or install the project.\n The Home Depot also devotes significant marketing, advertising and\n\nservice efforts toward attracting professional remodelers and commercial\n\nusers.\n\n\n  Management estimates that during the course of a year, a typical\n\nstore stocks approximately 40,000 to 50,000 product items, including\n\nvariations in color and size.\n Each store carries a wide selection of quality and nationally\n\nadvertised brand name merchandise.\n The table below shows the percentage of sales of each major product\n\ngroup for each of the last three fiscal years.\n However, these percentages may not necessarily be representative of\n\nthe Company 's future product mix due, among other things, to the effects of\n\npromotional activities associated with opening additional stores.\n Also, newly opened stores did not operate through a complete seasonal\n\nproduct cycle for all periods presented.\n\n  The Company sources its merchandise from approximately 8,000\n\nvendors worldwide, of which no single vendor accounts for as much as 10\n\npercent of purchases.\n The Company is not dependent on any single vendor.\n A substantial majority of merchandise is purchased directly from\n\nmanufacturers, thereby eliminating costs of intermediaries.\n Management believes that competitive sources of supply are readily\n\navailable for substantially all its products.\n\n \n\n  Management believes a number of the Company 's existing stores are\n\noperating at or above their optimum capacity.\n In order to enhance market penetration over time, the Company has\n\nadopted a strategy of adding new stores near the edge of the market areas\n\nserved by existing stores.\n While such a strategy may initially have a negative impact on the\n\nrate of growth of comparable store-for-store sales, management believes this \"\n\ncannibalization\" strategy increases customer satisfaction and overall market\n\nshare by reducing delays in shopping, increasing utilization by existing\n\ncustomers and attracting new customers to more convenient locations.\n\n  The Home Depot has continued to introduce or refine a number of\n\nmerchandising programs during fiscal 1994.\n Key among them is the Company 's ongoing commitment to becoming the\n\nsupplier of first choice to an assortment of professional customers,\n\nprimarily small- scale remodelers, carpenters, plumbers, electricians and\n\nbuilding maintenance professionals.\n The Company has reacted to the needs of this group by emphasizing\n\ncommercial credit programs, delivery services, new merchandising programs and\n\nmore efficient shopping through the Company 's Store Productivity Improvement\n\nprogram.\n\n  The Company continued a Company-wide roll-out of an enlarged\n\ngarden center prototype.\n These centers which are as large as 28,000 square feet, feature 6,000\n\nto 8,000 square foot house plant enclosures ( \" HPE\") or covered selling\n\nareas providing year round selling opportunities as well as a significantly\n\nexpanded product assortment.\n By the end of fiscal 1994, the prototype was in place in at least 244\n\nstores.\n By the end of fiscal 1995, these enlarged centers should be in most\n\nof the Company 's stores.\n\n  The organization of the merchandising group was revamped during\n\nfiscal 1994 to be more efficient and responsive to customers' needs.\n Under the new structure, both product line merchandisers and regional\n\nmerchandisers report to division merchandise managers who have responsibility\n\nfor broad product categories, such as construction, decor, repair and season-\n\nlawn/garden.\n\n  The Company 's installed sales program is available in 332 stores\n\nin 70 markets and is planned to be in all of the Company 's stores over the\n\nnext year.\n There are approximately 3,400 installed sales vendors who, as\n\nindependent, licensed contractors, are authorized to provide services to\n\ncustomers.\n This program targets the B-I-Y customer, who will purchase an item\n\nbut either does not have the desire or ability to install the item.\n\n  During the past year, the Company has continued its marketing\n\neffort to support its sponsorship of the 1994 and 1996 Olympic Games and the\n\nU.S. Olympic teams' participation at those games.\n In fiscal 1994, the Company unveiled a program to help pave the\n\nOlympic Park in Atlanta with engraved bricks, and hired athletes to work in\n\nits stores and offices while they train for the Olympic Games.\n The Company 's growing partnership with 29 key suppliers in the United\n\nStates and 26 in Canada is providing significant financial support for the\n\nsponsorship.\n\n  During fiscal 1994, the Company also announced its sponsorship of\n\nthe Paralympic Games, which will follow the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.\n Support of the Paralympic Games is symbolic of the Company 's\n\ncommitment to better serve those of its associates and customers with\n\ndisabilities. \n\n  In January 1994, the Company opened its second Expo(R) Design\n\nCenter in Atlanta, Georgia.\n The Expo stores, located in San Diego and Atlanta, enabled the\n\nregional merchandising staff to test a variety of upscale interior design\n\nproducts and services.\n Due to strong customer acceptance of its Expo stores, the Company\n\nplans to add Expo stores in Westbury, New York, and in Dallas, Texas, during\n\n1995.\n The Expo stores offer approximately 125,000 square feet of selling\n\nspace plus 5,000 square feet of climate controlled garden centers. \n\n  During 1994, the Company also opened additional food service\n\nfacilities in certain stores.\n These facilities are an extension of the Company 's commitment to\n\ntotal customer satisfaction, and are designed to provide customers and\n\nemployees with a convenient place to eat.\n The Company believes customers with limited amounts of time to\n\ncomplete their shopping, especially customers with small children, may spend\n\nmore time in the store if fast food is available on site.\n\n\n  On February 28, 1994, the Company acquired a 75 percent interest\n\nin the Aikenhead 's Home Improvement Warehouse ( \" Aikenhead 's\") chain in\n\nCanada.\n This 75 percent interest was purchased from the Molson Companies\n\nLimited ( \" Molson\").\n The Company has the right to acquire Molson 's remaining 25 percent\n\ninterest beginning in 2000.\n The Company is the managing partner of this partnership which\n\noperates as The Home Depot Canada.\n\n  During fiscal 1994, the Company began developing plans to open\n\nstores in Mexico.\n Although the Company has begun building relationships with key\n\nsuppliers in Mexico, entry into this market will be cautious and slow.\n On a long-term basis, however, it is anticipated that success in\n\nMexico could lead to more opportunities throughout Central and South\n\nAmerica.\n\n  The CrossRoads(tm) store format, announced during fiscal 1994,\n\nwill carry building and home improvement supplies sold at traditional Home\n\nDepot stores, as well as a broad assortment of products and services for\n\nfarmers and ranchers.\n By combining its traditional customer base with the markets in\n\nfarming and ranching communities, the Company anticipates being able to\n\npenetrate hundreds of smaller markets that might not otherwise have supported\n\nHome Depot stores.\n\n  The first CrossRoads store is expected to open in Quincy,\n\nIllinois during the summer of 1995, with stores in Waterloo, Iowa and\n\nColumbia, Missouri expected to also open during the year.\n The average CrossRoads store is expected to encompass more that\n\n100,000 square feet, plus additional outside selling space of approximately\n\n100,000 square feet.\n\n  \" The Home Depot\", the \" Homer\" advertising symbol and various\n\nprivate label brand names under which the Company sells a limited range of\n\nproducts are service marks, trademarks or trade names of the Company and are\n\nconsidered to be important assets of the Company.\n\n\n  Each store is equipped with a computerized point of sale system,\n\nelectronic bar code scanning system, and a mini-computer.\n These systems provide efficient customer check-out with an\n\napproximate 90 percent of scannable products, store-based inventory\n\nmanagement, rapid order replenishment, labor planning support, and item\n\nmovement information.\n In fiscal 1994 faster registers were introduced as well as a new\n\ncheck approval system and a new receipt format to expedite credit card\n\ntransactions.\n Store information is communicated to home office and divisional\n\noffice computers via a satellite and land-based communications network.\n These computers provide corporate financial and merchandising support\n\nsystems.\n\n  The Company is constantly assessing and upgrading its information\n\nsystems to support its growth, reduce and control costs, and enable better\n\ndecision-making.\n The Company continues to see greater efficiency as a result of its\n\nelectronic data interchange ( EDI) program.\n Currently, over 400 of the Company 's highest volume vendors are\n\nparticipating in the EDI program.\n A paperless system, EDI electronically processes orders from stores\n\nto vendors, alerts the store when the merchandise is to arrive and transmits\n\nvendor invoice data.\n\n  In fiscal 1994, the Company introduced phone centers to serve its\n\ncustomers who call to inquire about pricing and availability of merchandise.\n By adding experienced sales associates to a phone bank to answer\n\ncalls quickly and efficiently, weekly phone sales have increased.\n Without the necessity of responding to phone calls, the sales\n\nassociates can better concentrate on serving in- store customers.\n\n  In fiscal 1994, stores were outfitted with Electronic Article\n\nSurveillance ( \" EAS\") detectors that trigger an alarm if a person exits the\n\nstore with merchandise that has been affixed with an EAS label that has not\n\nbeen desensitized at the cash register.\n The system is proving to be a deterrent to theft, with many stores\n\nreporting reductions in shoplifting offenses.\n\n  The Company also operates its own television network and produces\n\ntraining and informational programs that are transmitted to stores via the\n\ncommunications network.\n\n\n  As of fiscal year end, The Home Depot employed approximately\n\n67,000 persons, of whom approximately 4,800 were salaried and the remainder\n\nwere compensated on an hourly basis.\n Approximately 83 percent of the Company 's employees are employed on a\n\nfull-time basis.\n In order to attract and retain qualified personnel, the Company seeks\n\nto maintain salary and wage levels above those of its competitors in its\n\nmarket areas.\n The Company 's policy is to hire and train additional personnel in\n\nanticipation of future store expansion.\n The Company has never experienced a strike or any work stoppage, and\n\nmanagement believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.\n There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of the\n\nCompany 's employees.\n\n\n  The business of the Company is highly competitive, based in part\n\non price, location of store, customer service and depth of merchandise.\n In each of the markets served by the Company, there are several other\n\nchains of building supply houses, lumber yards and home improvement stores.\n In addition, the Company must compete, with respect to some of its\n\nproducts, with discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores,\n\nwarehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and to a lesser extent,\n\nother retailers.\n\n  Due to the variety of competition faced by the Company,\n\nmanagement is unable to precisely measure the Company 's market share in its\n\nexisting market areas.\n Management, however, believes that the Company is an effective and\n\nsignificant competitor in these markets. \n\n\n  The following provides information concerning the executive\n\nofficers holding positions in the Company and/or its subsidiaries.\n\n  BERNARD MARCUS, age 65, has been Chairman of the Board of\n\nDirectors and Chief Executive Officer ( \" CEO\") of The Home Depot since its\n\ninception in 1978; and is, together with Mr. Arthur M.

{"text": "Working within the same intellectual boundaries, the English were\n\nable to conceptualize the Union as a marriage in which the partners were\n\ndifferent but compatible and, at least in theory, not unequal.\n The subservience of the feminine partner was natural, but not a matter\n\nof inferiority.\n\n  The utility of this discourse rested upon the ability of the\n\nEnglish to represent the Irish as feminine and the English as masculine.\n In doing so the English were able to draw on a long standing tradition\n\non both sides of the Irish Sea for, though the reconceptualization of the\n\nunion as a marriage was a product of the early nineteenth century,\n\nperceptions of the two peoples had been gendered for centuries, if not\n\nalways.\n English accounts dating back to Giraldus Cambrensis feminize the Irish\n\nas, indeed, do accounts by the Irish themselves.\n William Carleton and other Irish writers reinforced this gendered\n\ndiscourse in the nineteenth century, portraying impulsiveness, sensitivity\n\nand aptitude for poetry and music as fundamental Irish character traits.\n In The Black Prophet, for example, Carleton used the feminine\n\ncharacter of Sarah M'Gowan to represent Ireland 's needs and potential: \n\n  It is impossible to say to what a height of moral grandeur and\n\ntrue greatness culture and education might have elevated her, or to say with\n\nwhat brilliancy her virtues might have shown, had her heart and affections\n\nbeen properly cultivated.\n Like some beautiful and luxuriant flower, however, she was permitted\n\nto run into wildness and disorder for want of a guiding hand; but no want, no\n\nabsence of training, could ever destroy its natural delicacy, nor prevent its\n\nfragrance from smelling sweet, even in the neglected situation where it was\n\nleft to pine and die. ( 22) \n\n  The unlucky but desirable figure of Hibernia thus appeared a\n\nnatural mate for John Bull, whose own qualities could bring her potential\n\nbeauty to fruition.\n Anna Maria Hall, another Irish writer, confidently believed that\n\n  a union, based on mutual interests, is rapidly cementing.\n The insane attempts to procure 'Repeal' may retard, for a time, a\n\nconsummation for which every upright British subject must devoutly wish; but\n\na growing intelligence and increasing intimacy are barriers which the\n\nadvocates of the measure will vainly endeavour to break down. ( 23) \n\n  In the English-Irish union, the partners were considered not\n\nunequal, but different; the English would realize themselves through the\n\npractition of a public and masculine role within the marriage, while the\n\nIrish would find their destiny in a feminine and domestic role.\n Integration of the two through \" consummation\" of the marriage would\n\nresult in each making the other whole, bringing English values to the Irish\n\nand Irish values to the English.\n As John Garwood argued, the Irish possessed\n\n  in spite of all their social degradation, a peculiarity of\n\ncharacter which would blend most usefully with that of their Saxon\n\nneighbours.\n The English labourer, with all his manliness and honesty, is often\n\nwanting in intellectual acuteness and in imaginative glow.\n In both these characteristics the Irish excel. . .\n I do think that a few rays of Irish imagination, a little more play\n\nof fancy, more exuberance of joyousness, and more brightness of hope, would\n\ngreatly add to the happiness of our own poor. . .\n I would put more good sense into the Irishman, and more poetry into\n\nthe Englishman.\n And in this way I cannot but hope that even intellectually, morally,\n\nand socially, they may do each other good; and that the English character,\n\nretaining its own solidity, may acquire the gracefulness of the Irish, and\n\nwhile equally useful, become more pleasing, demand as much of our\n\napprobation, and more engage our love. ( 24) \n\n  The subordinate role of Ireland in the English-Irish marriage\n\nwas, however, always clear.\n Though different in fact, the Irish would lose their separate\n\nidentity in marriage - right down to the adoption of their \" husband 's\" name:\n\n\n\n  As a family name [ Anglo-Saxon] does not exclude the Celt,\n\nwhether Irish, Scotch, or Welsh; the two families are rapidly blending into\n\none, and it is only natural to retain the name of the predominating element.\n\n( 25)\n\n  Hibernia could not survive independently.\n\n\n  A repeal of the Union would eventually divorce Hibernia from John\n\nBull 'a mensa et thoro ' - and that without alimony of maintenance.\n It is true that she might, perhaps, be at liberty to form another\n\nmatrimonial connexion - but with whom would this new liason be? Johnny\n\nCrapaud - or Cousin Johnathan?\n Hibernia is not of the constitution to live in blessed singleness\n\nduring the remainder of her life. ( 26) \n\n  Once domesticated, however, the Irish would prove happy and\n\ncongenial partners in the Union.\n\n\n  the Irish are indeed a tractable nation, and though they have\n\nresisted chains of iron, they may easily be conducted by a kindly hand with a\n\nsilken thread. ( 27) \n\n  The English and many Irish therefore maintained an optimistic\n\nbelief that Irish moral and social improvement would follow on their\n\ndomestication through the spread of English law; reconciled in the marital\n\nbliss of the Union, the two peoples would become friends and allies.\n\n  The potato blight of 1845 and the famine that followed from 1846\n\nto 1852 appeared to English Liberals as a God-given opportunity to teach the\n\nIrish the value of English middle-class morality and learning.\n The efforts of English and Scotch scientists and agriculturalists to\n\ntutor the Irish peasants in methods of facing the crisis were hailed by the\n\nTimes, which noted with relish the inability of O'Connell and other Irish\n\nleaders to fend off the impending disaster.\n Indeed, in the first stages of the potato blight many English men and\n\nwomen believed that the famine would be a perfect occasion to divorce the\n\nIrish from the Repeal movement.\n The Times encouraged this by arguing that O'Connell 's continued\n\ncollection of the Repeal rent showed that he \" did not care\" about his\n\npeople, and should therefore be abandoned by the peasantry in favor of John\n\nBull. ( 28)\n Fired with confidence in the abilities of the enlightened middle\n\nclass to provide for Ireland in time of dearth, most English shared Sir James\n\nGraham 's confidence that \n\n  Ireland itself is softened in all its parts by their [ sic]\n\nsudden calamity; and capable of receiving new permanent impressions, if a\n\nmaster-hand can be found to direct them. ( 29) \n\n  The failure of free trade and middle-class science to prevent\n\nstarvation, however, worked to destroy this confidence.\n It became all too easy for the English to blame the Irish for\n\nIreland 's miseries rather than to question the middle-class ideals in which\n\nthe English had placed such faith.\n The reluctance of the traditionally-minded peasantry to accept the\n\noften bizarre advice of English scientists gave the latter an excuse to\n\nexculpate themselves and blame the peasants for the progress of blight and\n\ndearth.\n Robert Traile was one of these agriculturalists who visited Ireland\n\nwith grandiose plans to teach the peasantry to ventilate their potato pits,\n\nwhich he was convinced would save the country from famine.\n His frustration at his failure to do so was vented on the peasantry,\n\nas in the following message to Peel:\n\n  I found the miserable apathy, the unmanageable doggedness, of the\n\npeople, who would not move a hand, but folded their arms to wait, in\n\nlistlessness & torpid stupidity, the ruin of the food of themselves & their\n\nfamilies. ( 30) \n\n  As the distress deepened and Irish appeals for help multiplied,\n\nthe mood of the ministers became more pessimistic but still determined: \n\n  we shall succeed in the end.\n It will not be for many a long month, or many a long year perhaps\n\nthat we shall get the people in that country to do their duty decently. ( 31)\n\n\n\n  More and more, however, the Irish began to seem a threat to\n\nEnglish prosperity, particularly as the dearth spread to Europe and England\n\nsuffered from financial panics driven by railway speculation.\n Irish despair at the blight and famine increasingly appeared to the\n\nEnglish as a parasitical desire to live off the wealth of their neighbors,\n\nwith the inevitable result that England and Scotland would have to feed the\n\nwhole of the Irish population.\n In the mind of the Whig Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Charles\n\nWood, this was the product of \" the universal disposition to do as little for\n\nthemselves, & to throw as much upon the Government as possible.\"(32)\n By 1848 Lord Clarendon, the Whig Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, was like\n\nmany of his countrymen fuming that \" it is difficult to know how to deal with\n\nsuch a perverse people.\" ( 33) \n\n  By the middle of 1847 the English public had lost interest in\n\ncharitable donations to the Irish.\n The Times both reflected and irresponsibly fed this attitude,\n\ncomplaining that \" the working population of this country is dividing its\n\nlast loaf with Ireland,\"(34) a sacrifice for which the Irish were in any case\n\nungrateful, since \" we send money to Ireland and it is used as the price of\n\nsedition and to buy firearms.\"(35)\n The government 's decision to cut off aid outside the Irish Poor Law\n\nin the summer of 1847 was therefore popular in England.\n\n  The famine and the 1848 Young Ireland rising began, indeed, to\n\nmake the \" sister island\" appear more an object of fear than desire.\n The emigration of Irish paupers to England and Scotland, which had\n\nbeen going on for decades, added to English fears, coming after 1847 or so to\n\nseem increasingly ominous, like the spread of a moral and physical disease.\n English workers reacted to the Irish influx with particular fright,\n\nand, stirred by Protestant evangelical demagogues, sometimes greeted the\n\nIrish with violence.\n George Poulett Scrope, an economist ostensibly sympathetic to Irish\n\nsuffering, feared that continuing immigration would \" spread through Britain\n\nthe gangrene of Irish poverty, Irish disaffection, and the deadly paralysis\n\nof industry that necessarily attends upon these elements of evil.\"(36)\n Further intercourse between the two nations might therefore result\n\nonly in the spread of infection.\n\n  Even the longstanding belief in Irish fertility disappeared for a\n\ntime, though England remained tied to Ireland for better or for worse.\n English capitalism and money had not impregnated Hibernia; or, if it\n\nhad, it may only have helped give birth to a monster: \n\n  The money which the English government disburses, and the English\n\npeople pay, is not wholly barren or unproductive.\n It has its harvests, though not of the plough or the sickle.\n It has its fields, but not of peaceful fertility and gladdening\n\nrichness.\n Its crop is not the golden corn, but the steel blade; it has wrought\n\nbayonets for sickles, and firelocks for mattocks. ( 37) \n\n  Though some writers such as John Garwood remained optimistic\n\nconcerning the ultimate potential of the Anglo-Irish marriage, they were\n\nincreasingly the exception rather than the rule after 1850.\n Disgust at the \" unreasonable\" behavior of the Irish dampened\n\nenthusiasm for a more intimate Union.\n Instead, the British began to turn to a new discourse that justified\n\nBritish rule on the basis of Irish racial inferiority.\n\n  A minority of scientists and intellectuals, writing in journals\n\nsuch as the Medical Times, had long maintained a racialist interpretation of\n\nIrish difference; but before the famine their ideas were rarely supported in\n\nParliament or the popular press.\n The experiences of the famine, however, in conjunction with the\n\nefforts of newspapers like the Times, served to popularize biological racism\n\nas it was applied to the Condition of Ireland Question.\n By the beginning of the 1850s explicitly or implicitly racialist\n\nliterature spread widely through the press and in bookshops, and was received\n\nwith much acclaim.\n Many Liberals persisted in criticizing racialism, but for the\n\nremainder of the century the public would pay them as little heed as they had\n\nto the racialists before the famine.\n\n  Robert Knox 's work The Races of Men ( 1850) was the first and\n\nmost influential of a series of racialist works.\n Knox triumphantly rejected the Liberal understanding of the Irish\n\nquestion, which he characterized as being based upon \" long-received\n\ndoctrines, stereotyped prejudices, [ and] national delusions.\"(38)\n Sneering at those who, like John Bright, continued to seek the future\n\nmoral reformation of Ireland, Knox declared that \" the source of all evil\n\nlies in the race, the Celtic race of Ireland.\"(39)\n Significantly, he went out of his way to deny the possibility of\n\nlong-lasting results from \" the admixture of race by intermarriage.\"(40)\n Celt would always remain Celt, and Saxon would always remain Saxon: \"\n\nThe possible conversion of one race into another I hold to be a statement\n\ncontradicted by all history.\"(41)\n Finally, Knox savaged Liberal ideals of an intimate and fruitful\n\nmarriage in the Union with the simple statement that \" Ireland is not a\n\ncolony, but merely a country held by force of arms, like India; a country\n\ninhabited by another race.\" ( 42)", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "980ac6f9-414d-484a-9ce5-746cf4727d63", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.842857+00:00"}
{"text": "Although novice teachers might think that a best method exists,\n\nthey will be sorely disappointed.\n All language learners are different ( see my response to\n#9, below), so an effective teacher must draw from a range of methods in a\n\nprincipled manner.\n Understanding the history of language teaching and identifying\n\nsimilarities and differences between methods can also help a teacher realize\n\nthat each method is a reaction to a past method and can be useful in\n\ndifferent contexts.\n\n  If there is no best method, how should a teacher proceed?\n Researchers have identified numerous principles for teachers to follow\n\nin the absence of a single best method.\n According to Celce-Murcia ( 2001), for example, a good teacher\n\nassesses students' needs; identifies \" what can reasonably be taught\" based\n\non factors such as time constraints, class size, and materials; tailors\n\nactivities to students' attitudes and learning styles and to the situations\n\nand genres in which students need to communicate successfully; and figures\n\nout how to assess students' learning in a fair manner ( p. 10).\n Moreover, gathering information about one 's teaching, whether through,\n\ne.g., student surveys, peer observations, or field notes, can provide\n\nimportant information on the effectiveness of one 's teaching and the nature\n\nof students' learning ( Murphy, 2001).\n\n  Kumaravadivelu ( 1994), however, advocates that teachers abandon\n\nthe concept of method entirely.\n He suggests that we have now reached a \" postmethod condition\" that\n\nhas resulted from our \" heightened awareness\" that there is no best method:\n\n  Having witnessed how methods go through endless cycles of life,\n\ndeath, and rebirth, we now seem to have reached a state of heightened\n\nawareness--an awareness that as long as we are caught up in the web of\n\nmethod, we will continue to get entangled in an unending search for an\n\nunavailable solution, an awareness that such a search drives us to\n\ncontinually recycle and repackage the same old ideas and an awareness that\n\nnothing short of breaking the cycle can salvage the situation. ( 1994, p.\n\n28)\n\n  Kumaravadivelu argues that being aware that there is no best\n\nmethod is futile; despite this knowledge, we are still \" recyl[ing] and\n\nrepackag[ing]\" in order to create the best possible combination of methods.\n The only solution, Kumaravadivelu argues, is to stop looking for\n\nmethods and to abandon the concept entirely.\n He states that we need an alternative to method that empowers\n\nteachers to theorize from their practice and encourages them to listen to\n\ntheir \" subjective understandings\" ( or \" sense of plausibility\") ( 1994, p.\n\n31) that arise from their experience and education.. \n\n  Kumaravadivelu 's solution is to give teachers \" macrostrategies,\"\n\nwhich, he implies, are the basis of all good language teaching.\n His strategies include maximizing opportunities for students to\n\nlearn, privileging the negotiation of meaning, using inductive learning,\n\ncontextualizing the linguistic input, integrating language skills instead of\n\nteaching them separately, promoting learners' autonomy, making the\n\ninstruction relevant to the learners, and raising the learners' cultural\n\nawareness.\n These strategies, along with Celce-Murcia 's ( 2001) suggestions noted\n\nabove, could be considered good principles for language teaching that will\n\nhelp teachers and learners succeed\"without reliance on ( a) method.\"\n 4. It is important for teachers to understand the notion of\n\ntop-down and bottom-up processing.\n\n  Proficient language users rely on both top-down and bottom-up\n\nprocessing when they read or listen.\n When we hear or read something, we draw on our schema and background\n\nknowledge to interpret and predict what is going on, such as when we make\n\ninferences about a character 's behavior or predict the content and direction\n\nof a professor 's lecture.\n Simultaneously, however, we are decoding what we hear or read at an\n\nincredibly fast rate.\n We may only notice our decoding processes when we are forced to slow\n\ndown, such as when we read an academic text in an unfamiliar discipline or\n\nlisten for specific pieces of information in, say, a traffic report. \n\n  Teachers should understand these concepts because students need\n\nhelp developing not just bottom-up processing but also top-down and\n\ninteractive processing in listening, pronunciation, and reading instruction.\n How many of us actually think about what we are saying or hearing\n\nsound-by-sound\" ( Goodwin, 2001, p. 119)\n\n  Wilcox Peterson ( 2001) recommends activating students' top-down\n\nprocessing skills before every listening activity and building automaticity\n\nin bottom-up processing ( p. 89); otherwise, students will get frustrated at\n\nthe slow rate at which they decode what they see and hear.\n Reading rate development materials\"which help students read in\n\nchunks, minimize regressions, and minimize the number of fixations\"may be\n\nespecially useful to develop automaticity in reading.\n\n  Moreover, curricula now reflect the understanding that students\n\nneed practice at all leveles of processing.\n Goodwin ( 2001) reports that in pronunciation instruction, the\n\nbottom-up approach is being replaced by a more balanced approach in which \"\n\nthe sound system is addressed as it naturally occurs in the stream of speech\"\n\n( p. 119).\n Suprasegmental features ( e.g., thought groups, prominence,\n\nintonation) are taught first and segmentals ( e.g., consonants, vowels) are\n\nfocused on at various points, akin to a \" zoom lens\" ( p. 119).\n Many reading researchers have reached a similar conclusion: teachers\n\nneed to teach both phonics and whole language, a \" whole-to-part-to-whole\"\n\napproach ( Ediger, 2001, p. 161) that stresses both comprehension and\n\ndecoding. \n\n  When planning lessons, teachers should consider that that\n\nreliance on bottom-up or top-down processing often depends on several\n\nfactors: the student 's prior knowledge of the task or topic and the purpose,\n\nor function, of listening ( Morley, 2001, citing Richards, 1990).\n Morley cites a few of Richards' examples: If the student is listening\n\nin order to interact and socialize with others, then top-down processing\n\ndominates; and if student is listening to a friend tell a joke, then\n\nbottom-up processing dominates.\n Yet if the student is listening in order to extract or convey\n\ninformation, bottom-up processing dominates; and if the student is listening\n\nto something he or she has heard many times before, such as a flight\n\nattendant 's safety instructions, then top-down processing dominates ( pp.\n\n74-75).\n A teacher can use Richards' matrix of listening functions and\n\nprocesses to design lessons that develop students' listening skills in an\n\nappropriate way.\n\n  In addition, teachers should consider not just helping students\n\ndevelop these skills but also teaching them the metalanguage so that they can\n\nselect levels of processing strategically.\n Wilcox Peterson ( 2001) recommends helping students to understand the\n\ndifferent ways they process language and to \" [ n]otice how their processing\n\noperations interact with the text\" ( p. 89).\n\n 5. Accuracy and fluency should receive equal emphasis in the L2\n\ncurriculum\n\n  xfIn the past, methods such as grammar translation and\n\naudiolingualism emphasized accurate output over meaningful, fluent\n\ncommunication.\n With the introduction of communicative language teaching, however,\n\nteachers and researchers agree that there should be a balance between fluency\n\nand accuracy.\n According to Lazarton ( 2001), \" it is no longer acceptable to focus\n\nonly on developing the grammatical competence of our students [ ...] Today,\n\nteachers are expected to balance a focus on accuracy with a focus on fluency\n\nas well.\" ( p. 104).\n In reference to oral skills, Lazarton defines \" fluency\" as both\n\nattention to suprasegmental features and to the negotiation of meaning ( p.\n\n104).\n In reference to writing skills, fluency might refer to the ability to\n\ngenerate lots of text ( e.g., through freewriting), and, as in Lazarton 's\n\ndefinition, the ability to negotiate meaning. \n\n  Despite the consensus that there must be a balance, there are\n\nstill misconceptions about the role of accuracy in communicative language\n\nteaching.\n According to Savignon ( 2001), \" The perceived displacement of\n\nattention to morphosyntactic features in learner expression in favor of a\n\nfocus on meaning has led in some cases to the impression that grammar is not\n\nimportant, or that proponents of CLT favor learner self-expression without\n\nregard to form\" ( p. 24-25).\n Savignon argues that the appropriate balance depends on such factors\n\nas the students' age, the curriuclum, and the students' opportunities for\n\nusing the language outside of classroom ( p. 25).\n\n  Additional factors affecting attention to form are the goals of\n\nthe activity.\n In a communicative activity, explicit error correction would\n\ninterfere with communication, so the teacher might merely want to make a note\n\nof form-related errors and give feedback later.\n During activities that focus on form, however, the teacher could\n\npoint out the error when it occurs or could also bring it up later.\n An oral skills activity that develops both fluency and accuracy is\n\nthe audiotaped dialogue journal ( Lazarton, 2001, p. 109).\n The student records an impromptu reaction to a topic or prompt, and\n\nthe teacher can then react to its content and/or to the student 's grammar and\n\npronunciation.\n\n  In a writing class, attention to grammatical correctness is best\n\ndone when the student is working on a near-final draft, that is, once the\n\nstudent' content is set ( Kroll, 2001, p. 229).\n Yet merely pointing out grammatical errors in a near-final draft is\n\nnot enough to help students with accuracy; error feedback is most useful when\n\nthe student has already learned about the error via a minilesson and has had\n\npractice identifying and correcting the error in his or her own writing or in\n\na peer 's writing. \n\n  For instruction that focuses on form to be successful, a teacher\n\nshould be aware of \" options in how to make a rule explicit or not; whether\n\nor not to isolate a rule; whether an explanation should involve a deductive\n\nor inductive presentation; who should give the explanation: the teacher, the\n\ntext, or another student; whether the language is abstract or not; and\n\nwhether the explanation is provided orally or in writing\" ( Crookes &\n\nChaudron, 2001, p. 32). \n 6. A specific purpose approach to curriculum design is more\n\nefficient than a general purpose approach.\n\n  This statement carries two assumptions: that one approach to\n\ncurriculum design can be more efficient than another and that there is such a\n\nthing as a \" general purpose\" approach.\n I will address each assumption in turn and then discuss ways in which\n\na specific purpose approach requires substantial planning time. \n\n  First, different learners have different learning styles and\n\nstrategies ( Oxford, 2001), and there is no one-size-fits-all-approach for \"\n\nefficient\" learning.\n Yet according to Strevens ( 1988), one of the benefits of ESP is that\n\nit is \" focused on the learner 's need and wastes no time\" ( qtd. in Johns and\n\nPrice-Machado, 2001, p. 44).\n The ESP curriculum may indeed \" waste no time\" because of its design\n\nprinciples or \" absolute characteristics,\" which are that the curriculum \"\n\nmeets the specified needs of the learner\"; teaches content and language\n\nskills appropriate to the \" particular disciplines, occupations, or\n\nactivities,\" and is not \" General English\" ( Strevens, 1988, qtd. in Johns\n\nand Price-Machado, 2001, p. 44).\n The implications of these characteristics are that if the learners do\n\nnot need to develop a certain language skill or function for their specific\n\npurpose--say, perhaps only reading knowledge of the language is necessary, or\n\nperhaps the learner will be communicating over the phone much more than in\n\nwriting--then the specific purpose curriculum will reflect those needs.\n To the extent that the curriculum is tailored to learners' needs, the\n\nspecific purpose approach may be more efficient in helping learners\n\ncommunicate successfully in their specific context, be it electronics\n\nassembly, nursing, or a graduate program. \n\n  However, what is a \" general purposes\" approach? I agree with\n\nJohns and Price-Machado 's ( 2001) assertion that there is no such thing as \"\n\nGeneral English\": \" All language and language classes are specific to the\n\nlearner, the context, and the content\" ( p. 54).\n I would qualify this by saying that all good language classes are\n\nthose things, but even if a teacher teaches language and content that is\n\nirrelevant to his or her learners and their contexts, this curriculum design\n\nis not \" General\" English, just perhaps \" off-target\" English or English\n\npoorly specified to the learners' needs.\n A preemployment VESL class, which teaches job skills such as making\n\nrequests and answering the phone, is still teaching skills for a specific\n\npurpose, even though Johns and Price-Machado note that it is a \" modified\n\nversion of a general ESL class\" ( 2001, p. 51). \n\n  Although a specific purpose curriculum may help learners reach\n\ntheir communicative goals more efficiently than, say, a poorly specified\n\ncurriculum, it may be more time-consuming to plan because it involves, among\n\nother things, a needs assessment.\n A true specific purpose curriculum, in fact, requires a needs\n\nassessment.\n Such an activity helps curriculum designers determine what students\n\nneed to do in English in their specific context or occupation and how they do\n\nit.\n A needs assessment can be performed by asking students or other\n\nstakeholders to fill out questionnaires or participate in interviews, by\n\nobserving or shadowing students on the job, by determining students' learning\n\nstyles, and by analyzing spoken or written reflections by students or their\n\nsupervisors ( Johns and Price-Machado, 2001, p. 49).\n The ESP curriculum also includes continual assessment of \" what types\n\nof content are central, how content is used and valued, and the relationships\n\nbetween vocabulary and central concepts\" ( p. 50).\n Additionally, the curriculum designers might analyze the discourses\n\nand genres of the specific context or occupation.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "22cb762e-b975-4be1-8fa8-2fcbf035c330", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.844287+00:00"}

April 27 at Carriage Hill nursing\n\nhome in Silver Spring.\n\n\n  Mr.Brown began his morning show, which aired for many years from\n\n6 to 10:30 a.m. on WOL-AM ( 1260), on Nov. 1, 1935.\n\n\n  Although it featured a traditional sampling of news, sports,\n\nweather and music, it also boasted a popular host of genial wit with an easy,\n\ninformal style and occasional crotchety comments. \n\n\n\n\n  Jerzy Kosinski, 57, who in such novels as \" Being There,\" \"\n\nSteps\" and \" The Painted Bird\" told harsh tales of degradation and despair in\n\na deceptively natural and simple style, was found dead yesterday in his\n\nManhattan apartment.\n\n  Police said his wife, Katherina von Fraunhofer-Kosinski, found\n\nhim in the bathtub with a plastic bag pulled over his head, and called the\n\ndeath an apparent suicide.\n Authorities added that a note had been found near his body, but they\n\ndeclined to reveal its contents.\n\n  Kosinski 's wife, in a statement released through a publicist and\n\nreported By the Associated Press, said: \" My husband had been in\n\ndeteriorating health as a result of a serious heart condition.\n He had become depressed by his growing inability to work, and by his\n\nfear of being a burden to me and his friends.\"\n\n\n  His first novel, \" The Painted Bird,\" which appeared in 1965, was\n\na critical and popular success.\n An autobiographical work, it recounted with mounting horror the\n\nterrible solitary journeys of a young child through an Eastern Europe\n\ndevastated by war.\n \" Steps,\" his second novel, was published in 1968 and continued the\n\nsaga of the youth as an adult.\n\n\n  His 1971 novel, \" Being There,\" was a masterful satire of\n\nAmerica, television and politics.\n It told of \" Chance,\" a gardener whose only contact with the outside\n\nworld was what he saw on televison.\n Forced into the world, he becomes a popular celebrity and an oracle\n\nsought by the rich and famous, who regarded his puzzled utterings as Zen-like\n\nwisdom.\n\n  \" Being There\" was made into a 1979 movie, for which Mr.Kosinski\n\nwrote the screenplay.\n Peter Sellers played the role of Chance, and Shirley MacLaine also\n\nstarred.\n Melvyn Douglas won an Oscar for his supporting role.\n In 1981, Mr. Kosinski himself acted in a film, playing Bolshevik\n\nleader Grigory Zinoviev in Warren Beatty 's \" Reds.\"\n\n\n  Mr.Kosinski 's work, often depressing and almost always\n\ndisturbing, reflected a life that was as unusual as it was interesting.\n\n\n  Born Jerzy Nikodem Kosinski in Lodz, Poland, on June 14, 1933, he\n\nspent the first six years of his life as the only child of Jewish\n\nintellectual parents.\n\n  With the 1939 Nazi invasion and occupation of Poland, he became\n\nseparated from his parents.\n He roamed the roads and forests of his native land, living in fear\n\nnot only of the German invader, but also of Polish peasants who seemed as\n\nlikely to show him hostility as hospitality.\n\n  After the war, almost miraculously, he was reunited with his\n\nparents.\n But the accumulated horrors to which he had been exposed resulted in\n\nhis being rendered mute for five years.\n He recovered to graduate from the University of Lodz, where he went\n\non to receive master 's degrees in history and political science.\n He continued his studies in Warsaw and the Soviet Union before\n\nobtaining permission to study in the United States.\n\n  He arrived in this country in 1957, working at such jobs as truck\n\ndriver and paint-scraper while working toward a doctorate in political\n\nsociology at Columbia University.\n He eventually received a doctorate in Hebrew letters from\n\nColumbia.\n\n  He postponed his early studies in this country to write.\n His first book, a nonfiction work, \" The Future Is Ours, Comrade:\n\nConversations with the Russians,\" was published in 1960 under an assumed\n\nname.\n\n  His other books included \" The Devil Tree,\" \" Cockpit,\" \" Blind\n\nDate,\" \" Passion Play\" and \" Pinball.\"\n His last book, \" The Hermit of 69th Street,\" was published in\n\n1988.\n\n  His books seemed at times filled with rage and revenge, at others\n\nsimply a haunting means of recounting strange parables.\n They featured themes such as the struggle of the individual against\n\nan increasingly regimented world and the confusion caused by the blurring of\n\ndistinctions between reality and fiction.\n He always wrote in English, saying that he was not able to work in\n\neither Polish or Russian.\n\n  Mr.Kosinski said that he had learned English by attending films\n\nand memorizing poetry.\n When he began to write, he worked late at night and would call \"\n\ndirectory assistance,\" relying on the telephone company to answer questions\n\nabout grammar and syntax.\n\n  He told a reporter: \" I got incredible advice.\n\n\n  Another unusual facet of his methodology was the employment of \"\n\neditors\" to work with him while he wrote his novels, and he was accused of\n\nplagiarism for this practice.\n Writing for the Village Voice, he disputed the allegations.\n The New York Times reported that the allegations had actually been\n\ninstigated by Poland 's military government of the time.\n\n  Mr.Kosinski had served as president of PEN from 1973 to 1975, was\n\na director of the International League for Human Rights from 1973 to 1979,\n\nand was active in the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n  In recent years, he had returned to Poland, where he spoke of\n\nreconciliation between Poland and the West and ethnic Poles and Polish Jews.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  The heaviest concentrations of goods for sale have traditionally\n\nbeen along the

sellers\n\nalready have been active.\n\n  Throngs of hawkers have erected tables and tents on grassy\n\nroadsides and gawkers are in pursuit of priceless treasures at bargain\n\nprices.\n\n  Throughout the weekend, thousands will be searching for\n\neverything from undiscovered Picasso etchings to collections of\n\nElvis-on-velvet paintings.\n\n  \" My dealers set up and started selling

busy.\n\n  For the weekend, Mrs. Cannon hired an off-duty school-crossing\n\nguard to help people cross the road.\n And Walden police have set up tape and barricades to prevent parking\n\non the road shoulder and keep traffic slowdowns in the town to a minimum.\n\n  But antique dealers and other businesses in the town protested.\n\n\n  Other than that fatal accident, most yard sale problems have been\n\nfinding parking, potables, potties and enough cash and trunk space for the\n\nmust-haves found along the way.\n\n  The sale began in 1987 as the brainchild of the Fentress County,\n\nTenn.,

{"text": "LINGUISTICS & CONTRASTIVE ANALYSIS BES 620, Spring Semester, 1994\n\nEXAM\n#2 by \n\n 1. Select a phoneme in English and discuss how the place of\n\narticulation explains the pronunciation or the phoneme. \n\n  The phoneme [ s] in English is made by placing the tip of the\n\ntongue against the alveolar ridge just behind the upper teeth and forcing air\n\nthrough a narrow opening between the tongue and the alveolar ridge.\n This makes it a class that English uses part of a class of sounds\n\ncalled fricatives frequently.\n Fricatives are all made through some means of forcing air through an\n\nopening to make a sort of buzzing or hissing sound.\n This includes sounds such as [ f], [ v], and [ z], as well as [ s).\n The [ s] sound is distinguished not only through its place of\n\narticulation, which is the same as [ z], but also by virtue of being unvoiced\n\n( the vocal chords do not vibrate when It is sounded).\n 2. What 's the difference between the English alphabet and the\n\nphonetic alphabet?\n\n\n  The difference between these two alphabets is the bane of writing\n\nstudents everywhere - - native and non-native speakers of English alike.\n English, although it has a wide range of phonemes, simply does not\n\nhave a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds It uses and the letters\n\nit uses to form words.\n The phonetic alphabet, on the other hand, has this basic\n\ncorrespondence: [ I] will forever be [ I], for example, whether it is in the\n\nword cheat, beet, complete, or amigo.\n Although kindergarten teachers all across the country teach the\n\nsounds of the English alphabet as if they were regular and definable, this is\n\na lesson that students generally have to unlearn later in life.\n Sometimes I think it would be better if we were to teach English as\n\nan ideographic system, like the system of Chinese characters, because it\n\nmight help alleviate the sense of betrayal that students feel when they\n\ndiscover that the letter \" a\" can have multitude of sounds - - or no sound at\n\nall - - and the lessons that Mrs. McGillicuddy taught them when they were\n\nfive or six about the long and the short sound of \" a\", or the rule that \"\n\nwhen two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking\", are frequently\n\nviolated in practice.\n It is hard to find a phonological rule in English orthography that\n\ndoes not have exceptions, and this makes things difficult for both teachers\n\nand students, I think it is time, given the current ascendancy of English as\n\na global lingua franca, to militate for spelling reform but that is probably\n\njust a pipe dream, given the conservative nature or a codified language With\n\nSuch a large corpus of published work as Is available In English.\n However, even if English were to regularize Its spelling, there would\n\nstill be a need for the phonetic alphabet.\n This is because the phonetic alphabet is primarily useful\n\ncross-linguistically, to talk about sounds that may have different\n\northographic representations in different languages.\n For example, the letter \" x\" in the pinyin system, which was used to\n\nalphabetize Chinese, is a very different sound from what the letter \" x\"\n\nrepresents in Greek.\n I could give many more examples ( compare \" r\" in Spanish and French,\n\nfor instance), but the point is that the phonetic alphabet makes it possible\n\nto compare the sounds of different languages without confusing competing\n\northographies.\n 3. Supply an English word containing two derivational affixes and\n\none inflectional affix.\n Explain why the two affixes are derivational and the one affix is\n\ninflectional,</H>\n\n  ( I am going to assume that its OK to talk about a word with more\n\nthan two derivational affixes, since I am having trouble coming up the exact\n\ncombination of derivational and inflectional affixes that you ask for here.)\n Here 's a word that not only illustrates the process of derivational\n\nand inflectional affixes, but also the process of how new words are created\n\nthrough such affixation.\n \" Ungrammatical I ties\" is made up of five morphemes, by my count,\n\nanalyzed as follows.\n The root or head word here would be \" grammar\", the study of the\n\nform, structure, and sometimes meaning of language.\n This becomes \" grammatical\" by adding one of several suffixes that\n\nare used in English to make a noun Into an adjective.\n I then add another suffix ( - ity\"), to turn It back into a noun, but\n\nwith an altered meaning ( \" grammar\" is not the same as \" grammaticality\").\n Going one step further, I put on the prefix \" un-\" to reverse the\n\nmeaning and turn \" grammaticality\" into its opposite.\n So far, all these affixations are derivational - - they alter the\n\nlexical class of the word and/or change its meaning.\n To create a word with an inflectional morpheme, I pluralize \"\n\nungrammaticality\" to get \" ungrammaticalities.\"\n The \" - s\" ending ( which, in this case, also involves a spelling\n\nchange) is inflectional because it merely changes the function of the word\n\nfrom singular to plural and does not alter its class ( it remains a noun) or\n\nits basic meaning ( which remains as tortured as ever).\n Now the fact that there is no such word in English as ..\n\nungrammaticalities\" does not stop me from using it, nor does it change the\n\nprocess of its formation, nor does it prevent you from understanding its\n\nmeaning 0 hope).\n You could argue that the idea could be expressed in some more elegant\n\nmanner, but you would probably have to throw out ninety percent of the\n\nobfuscation of academics as well, and then where would we be?\n 4. Supply one example each of a compound and a lexical borrowing\n\nin English.\n\n\n  \" Cakewalk\" is a compound word with an amusing history, Composed\n\nof two familiar words, it was originally the name for a kind of promenade in\n\nwhich competitors vied to see who could perform the most complex steps, and\n\nthe winners were awarded ( you guessed it) a cake.\n It became codified as a compound when a popular dance and a\n\nparticular style of music came out of these competitions, It has since taken\n\non an additional meaning of \" an easy time,\" probably through a folk\n\netymology that associated \" cakewalk\" with the phrase, \" It was a piece of\n\ncake.\"\n\n  Lexical borrowing is rampant in English, but I'll 'llnfine myself\n\nto two related words, \" taco\" and \" burrito.\"\n These were both borrowed from Spanish because English had no\n\ncorresponding words to talk about these staples of Latino cuisine.\n It would probably be hard to find a person in the States today who\n\ndid not recognize these words as being food items - - although you could\n\ncertainly find a fair number of monolingual Anglo-Americans who didn't know\n\nthe difference between the two, A purist might argue that these are not\n\nEnglish words, but once a word is understood and used frequently enough it\n\nsimply becomes part of the language.\n It 's only after enough time ( and usage) goes by, when the origin has\n\nbeen generally forgotten, that such words are deemed acceptable by the\n\npurists.\n\n  ( I can't really explain these choices except to say that these\n\nare the words that occurred to me.\n\n 5. Why is the yes/no question Did the class meet early? formed by\n\nthe insertion of the verb Did rather than by simple inversion of the subject\n\nand verb ( as in Is the class meeting early?\n\n\n  One of the most befuddling things about English is this \" Do\"\n\ninsertion, because it is not a universal way of forming questions - - even\n\nwithin English itself.\n \" Met the class early?\" has a vaguely archaic sound, and most people\n\nwould be hard-put to say why it was incorrect, although it is clearly\n\nnonexistent in terms of current usage.\n Part of what 's confusing about this construction Is that the verb \"\n\ndo\" takes on any necessary inflectional form ( \" did\" In this example), while\n\nthe lexical verb ( \" meet\" in this case) reverts to its base form.\n I could say, \" Is the class meeting early?\" but this would change the\n\ntense, and hence the meaning, implying that the class was still going on.\n Even If I change it to \" Was the class meeting early?\" the use of the\n\nprogressive form of the verb has different implications than the original\n\nquestion.\n If I were to say \" Was the class early?\" I would be closest to the\n\noriginal meaning, but even then there are different possibilities for each\n\nutterance.\n The use of \" did\" Implies ( although it does not guarantee) that the\n\nspeaker Is talking about one particular Instance, \" did\" in this case carries\n\nthe form and meaning of the preterit.\n On the other hand, \" Was the class early?\" would usually imply (\n\nalthough not always) that the speaker was talking about the regular meeting\n\ntime of an ongoing class that had now finished.\n However, because English does not make a clear distinction between\n\nthe Imperfect and preterit, the full meaning of these two questions would be\n\ndetermined by the context,.\n The way I explain this to my students is by asking them to look for\n\nthe \" main verb.\"\n If this verb is a form of \" to be\" ( as in \" The class was early.\"),\n\nthe question can be formed by simple Inversion.\n If the verb is anything else, \" do\" needs to be inserted, with the\n\nchoice of the form dependent on the form or the original verb.\n Thus, \" The class met early.\" becomes \" Did the class meet early?\"\n The explanation Is difficult to get into without using such\n\ncomplicated terms as \" lexical verb\" or \" bare infinitive,\" but I think It is\n\nuseful for some students, in order to conceptualize the process.\n For those who are hopelessly confused by such an explanation, one can\n\nonly resort to practice - - which is how we native speakers of English\n\nlearned this rule as children.\n 6. Why is might considered an auxiliary verb and walk a lexical\n\nverb?\n\n\n  \" Walk\" is considered a lexical verb because it has some kind of\n\nreferential meaning: it refers to an action which we distinguish from other\n\nactions by certain characteristics.\n There are also abstract lexical verbs, such as \" think,\" or\n\nnon-active verbs such as \" lack,\" for which it would be harder to find a\n\nclear referent, but every lexical verb has a meaning independent of its\n\ngrammatical context.\n An auxiliary verb, on the other hand, only has meaning when it is\n\ncombined with a lexical verb.\n While it is possible to say \" I might,\" it would have to be paired\n\nwith another, Implied verb.\n Otherwise, the only appropriate response would be \" You might what?\"\n The word \" might\" is used to express the idea of possibility, but it\n\nis a grammatical idea that must be placed within the context of the sentence.\n An auxiliary verb such as \" might\" could be used with any other verb;\n\nat the same time, it must be used with some other verb,.\n There are auxiliaries such as \" have\" that also can be lexical verbs,\n\nbut \" might\" does not have this possibility. \n 7. Supply two words in English related by the relation of\n\nhyponymy.\n\n\n  \" Rice\" and \" wheat\" are hyponyms because they are part of a\n\nclass of words we call \" grains.\"\n Hyponymy is the relationship between such groups of words, and as\n\nsuch it is a relationship of meaning that usually is unconnected to the form\n\nor origin of the words.\n \" Rice\" and \" wheat\" share the characteristics of being edible\n\ngrasses that have been cultivated for centuries.\n We use them for many of the same purposes, for making flour, cereal,\n\nbread, etc.\n It is useful to conceptualize them as being related, and hyponymy is\n\nsimply a linguist 's way of conceptualizing this conceptualization. \n 8. What semantic features distinguish the words hen and man.\n Explain your choice of the features you select to distinguish the\n\nwords.\n\n  Hen = - human, +female, +mature, +animal, +bird,\n\n+domesticated\n\n \n\n  In presenting these semantic features, I have tried to put them\n\nin an order f descending specificity, with the last feature being the most\n\nparticular, one of the most basic semantic distinctions we make Is between\n\nhuman and non-human ( one could argue that this is also one of our most basic\n\nproblems as well, but I 'll leave that as a moot point for the\n\neco-philosophers).\n Another key distinction, almost as important in our thinking, is\n\nbetween male and female.\n Less important, but still basic to the conceptualization of the\n\nworld, is the distinction between maturity and immaturity in living things.\n It is Interesting that this Is as far as I could get with the word \"\n\nman.\"\n This is because \" man\" is itself a basic concept, specific and\n\ncommonplace in one sense, broad and mystical in another.\n For \" hen,\" I considered \" +animal\" to be a separate distinction from \"\n\n- human,\" because there are several large categories of nonhuman things.\n \" +bird\" distinguishes the kind of animal a \" hen\" is, as does \"\n\n+domesticated,\" although the two are different kinds of distinctions, still\n\nbroad enough to be considered semantic features.\n 9. All of the languages of the world contain words that could be\n\nanalyzed as nouns and verbs.\n Would this be an absolute universal, a universal tendency, or an\n\nimplicational universal?\n\n\n  The fact that all the languages of the world have nouns and verbs\n\nis an absolute universal.\n An absolute universal, as its name implies, is a rule of language\n\nthat has no exceptions.\n In a way, this is what makes the whole concept of language universals\n\npossible.\n If there were no absolute universals, if there were no identifiable\n\nfeatures that cut across all languages, the theory that there is some kind of\n\ncognitive process or facility governing our acquisition and use of language\n\nwould probably never have been formed.\n Until some other form of communication is discovered that breaks the\n\nmold of human language ( decoded dolphin songs? extraterrestrial\n\ncommunications?), it will be through the study of language universals that we\n\nlearn about the structure of the cognitive process that makes language\n\npossible in the first place.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8191f345-e63e-453c-abbd-1fb06b94622d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.848089+00:00"}
{"text": "Molecular biology has revolutionized the study of protein\n\nstructure and function.\n Not only has the microbial production of enzymes and other proteins in\n\nuseful amounts become routine in recent years, but systematic alteration of\n\nprotein sequence by site-directed mutagenesis is now a standard tool for\n\ndissecting chemical mechanism.\n The recent development of new methods for ligating peptides, however,\n\npromises to make chemical synthesis of large proteins an attractive\n\nalternative to biosynthesis, particularly for the construction of novel\n\nmolecules containing non-natural amino acids or other structural\n\nmodifications.\n\n  Attempts to synthesize proteins chemically have traditionally\n\nfollowed one of two basic strategies: stepwise assembly from their\n\nconstituent amino acids on a solid support, or convergent coupling of peptide\n\nsegments in solution.\n Although solid-phase peptide synthesis has been optimized to the\n\nextent that proteins over 100 amino acids in length can be prepared in\n\nfavorable cases [ l], such syntheses still represent heroic undertakings and\n\nthe number of side products that accumulate over the many coupling steps that\n\nare necessary often makes purification of the final product laborious.\n Convergent coupling has the considerable advantage that synthesis and\n\npurification of peptide segments up to 30 residues long is relatively\n\nstraightforward; since a variety of unusual amino acids can be introduced\n\ninto each segment, this approach is also highly adaptable to the preparation\n\nof multiple analogs of naturally-occurring proteins.\n But broad implementation of the fragment condensation strategy has\n\nbeen limited by the poor solubility of protected peptide segments and the\n\ntendency of a-carboxy-activated peptides to racemize.\n Many of these difficulties can be circumvented by enzymatic coupling\n\nprocedures.\n Proteolytic enzymes, particularly serine proteases, have been used\n\nextensively in peptide synthesis because of their selectivity, ability to\n\nfunction under mild reaction conditions, and minimal requirements for\n\nprotecting groups [ 2].\n Although it might seem counterintuitive to attempt to synthesize a\n\nprotein using a protease, problems due to proteolytic degradation of the\n\nfinal peptide product by the catalyst can be minimized by manipulating the\n\nreaction conditions or through genetic engineering.\n For example, replacement of the active site serine in subtilisin with\n\ncysteine converts the protease into an acyl transferase: the modified enzyme\n\nis readily acylated by esters and subsequently deacylated by amines, but has\n\ngreatly diminished amidase activity compared with wild-type subtilisin [ 3].\n However, substitution of sulfur for oxygen engenders steric crowding\n\nin the active site, limiting the activity of the enzyme.\n Wells and colleagues [ 4] have relieved this crowding by mutating a\n\nsecond residue in the active site.The resulting double mutant, dubbed\n\n0subtiligase,\u00a1 eficiently couples unprotected peptides in water.\n\n  The acyl donor in a typical subtiligase-catalyzed ligation ( Fig.\n\n1) is a peptide whose carboxyl terminus is esterified with a\n\nglycolate-phenylalanine amide group.\n This ester efficiently acylates subtiligase because of the enzyme\u00a1s\n\npreference for glycine and phenylalanine in the two positions directly\n\nfollowing the 0cleavage\u00a1 site, Pl\u00a1 and P2\u00a1, respectively.\n Deacylation of the enzyme by a fully deprotected peptide ( or\n\nprotein) corresponding to the desired acceptor fragment then yields the\n\nligated product.\n Nearly quantitative yields have been obtained for reactions between\n\nmodel esters and dipeptide nucleophiles [ 4].\n Such an approach has also been successfully applied to the\n\npost-translational modification of natural and recombinant proteins.\n For instance, biotinylated and heavy- atom derivatives of N-methionyl\n\nhuman growth hormone were prepared by ligating peptides that contain biotin\n\nor mercury to the hormone\u00a1s N-terminus [ 5].\n Wong et al. [ 6] have used analogous enzymatic methods to synthesize\n\na variety of N- and Olinked glycopeptides.\n Blockwise assembly of large proteins by repeated couplings of long\n\npeptides is also possible.\n The enzyme RNase A ( 126 amino acids) was synthesized in good yield\n\nand high purity by subtiligase-catalyzed ligation of six peptide fragments\n\nranging in length from 12 to 30 residues [ 7].\n RNase A mutants containing the unnatural amino acid 4-fluorohistidine\n\nin place of the histidines at positions 12 and 119 were also prepared to\n\nexamine whether the basic nature of these residues is important in catalysis\n\n[ 7].\n Given that the incorporation of multiple unnatural amino acids into a\n\nprotein backbone is not currently possible using recombinant technologies,\n\nthis application of subtiligase illustrates the potential utility of chemical\n\napproaches to protein total synthesis.\n By expanding the set of possible changes that can be made, our\n\nability to probe structure-function relationships in proteins with the\n\nprecision of physical organic chemistry and to design new materials with\n\nnovel properties will increase dramatically.\n Site-specific incorporation of NMR probes, structural constraints,\n\nand catalytic cofactors into proteins are only some of the exciting\n\npossibilities that spring to mind.\n\n  The utility of subtiligase-catalyzed peptide coupling is a\n\nconsequence, in part, of its high reaction rates and relatively broad\n\nspecificity.The glycolate esters used as acyl donors are stable and easily\n\nprepared by solid-phase methods, so that side-reactions, especially\n\nracemization, which are often problematic in the chemical coupling of\n\nactivated peptides are suppressed.\n The fact that the enzyme tolerates a wide range of Pl, Pl\u00a1, P2 and\n\nP2\u00a1 amino acids also provides great latitude in the choice of ligation site.\n Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to broaden this specificity\n\nfurther [ 4,6] and to increase the stability of the enzyme [ 5,6].\n The design of subtiligase variants capable of coupling peptides in 4\n\nM guanidine hydrochloride may be particularly important [ 5], as\n\nhighly-structured peptides and proteins are otherwise poor substrates for the\n\nligase.\n\n  New non-enzymatic methods for coupling peptide fragments,\n\nincluding highly structured peptides, have the potential to complement and\n\nextend enzymatic ligation procedures considerably.\n Several research groups [ g-10] have reported powerful chemical\n\nligation strategies that can be carried out under fully denaturing conditions\n\nwith high efficiency.\n In these reactions, unprotected peptide fragments are specifically\n\nbrought together in such a way as to juxtapose the acyl donor and amine\n\nacceptor.\n The high effective molarity of the reactive groups then ensures\n\nfacile intramolecular formation of the desired peptide bond.\n This approach, which bypasses the need for highly activated acyl\n\ndonors, is illustrated by the recent work of Kent and coworkers [ lo].\n\n  As shown in Fig. 2, native chemical ligation can be achieved by\n\nchemoselectively reacting a peptide bearing a thioester at its carboxyl\n\nterminus with a second peptide capped at its amino end by a cysteine.\n The resulting thioester ligation product undergoes a rapid,\n\ngeometrically favorable rearrangement involving acyl transfer from the thiol\n\nto the amine, yielding a final product that contains a native amide bond at\n\nthe ligation site.\n Both peptide segments are conveniently prepared by conventional\n\ntechniques, and coupling is rapid and selective in aqueous buffer, occurring\n\nwithout significant side reactions.\n In fact, solubilizing agents such as urea and guanidine hydrochloride\n\nappear to enhance the chemical efficiency of reaction by concentrating and\n\ndenaturing the peptide segments.\n The synthesis of interleukin- 8, a 72-residue cytokine that contains\n\nmultiple disulfide bonds, demonstrates the utility of this approach for the\n\npreparation of moderately-sized polypeptides [ lo]; the synthesis of larger\n\nproteins and protein analogs is limited only by the availability of larger,\n\nappropriately modified peptide segments.\n Although native chemical ligation strategies require a cysteine at\n\nthe coupling site, this is not likely to be a significant limitation in the\n\npreparation of proteins with novel architectures.The thiol side chain is a\n\nuseful catalytic group and/or metal ligand in many proteins.\n It is also readily converted through selective alkylation to a\n\nvariety of anionic, cationic and neutral functionalities.\n Indeed, the high yields and comparatively easy implementation of the\n\nchemical approach are likely to render it an effective alternative to\n\nenzymatic coupling methods in many instances, and a successful marriage of\n\nthe two techniques may dramatically increase the size range of polypeptides\n\ndirectly accessible by total chemical synthesis.\n\n  Of course, chemists wishing to synthesize proteins need not be\n\nbound by nature\u00a1s choices.\n In addition to expanding the repertoire of amino acid side chains\n\nthat can be incorporated into proteins, chemical synthesis makes backbone\n\nengineering possible: peptide segments and protein domains can be joined by\n\nlinkages other than the amide bond.\n This point is illustrated by variants of HIV- l protease containing\n\nnovel thiol ester linkages [ 11,12], which were constructed by combining a\n\npeptide fragment possessing a C-terminal thioester with a second segment\n\nbearing a bromoacetyl group at its amino end.\n Alkylation of the thiol occurs rapidly and in high yield.\n When the thioester replaces the natural peptide bond between Gly51\n\nand Gly52, the alkylated product remains fully active [ l 11, but when it is\n\nused to replace the Gly49-Ile50 peptide bond, catalytic activity is reduced [\n\n12].\n This observation provided direct evidence for the notion that\n\nspecific backbone hydrogen bonds from the enzyme active site flaps to the\n\nsubstrate are important for the catalytic function of the protease.\n Backbone engineering has also been exploited for the rapid assembly\n\nof a four-helix bundle on a ternplating peptide [ 13] and for semisynthesis\n\nof analogs of human granulocyte colony stimulating factor containing a single\n\nbackbone acyl hydrazone bond [ 14]\n\n  In sum, versatile new methods for coupling peptides provide the\n\nbasis for a general and modular approach to the chemical synthesis of large\n\nproteins.\n Accordingly, the field of protein chemistry is likely to experience\n\nsomething of a renaissance.\n For decades to come, wide implementation of these technologies will\n\nprovide exciting research opportunities for chemists and biologists\n\ninterested in exploring protein structure and function. \n\n\n\n  The chlorobenzene emissions detected in the stack effluent of\n\nthis facility probably resulted from a combination of two processes.\n The first is the original contamination found in the sludge feed.\n Previous studies have shown chlorobenzene to be a very stable\n\ncompound, even when decompoSed as part of a mixture ( 17,18)-.\n Thus, the appearance of chlorobenzene in the stack is probably due in\n\npart to its ability to undergo relatively harsh thermal exposures and escape\n\nunscathed.\n\n  The second contribution to the emission of chlorobenzene at the\n\nfull-scale facility is the possibility that this compound was formed as a\n\nPIC.\n We have conducted many studies involving the decomposition of benzene\n\nand/or toluene or related compounds in the presence of chlorinated species.\n The free chlorine radicals generated in such a reaction atmosphere\n\nhave host of chlorine- containing compounds were detected in the sludge feed\n\nat the full- scale facility, it is logical that chlorobenzene was detected in\n\nthe stack. \n\n\n\n  Food items in stomachs were identified to the lowest practical\n\ntaxon and counted under a dissecting microscope.\n The individual prey items were blotted dry and weighed to the nearest\n\nmilligram.\n Typically, crustaceans were identified to genus or family and insects\n\nto family or order.\n Fish were identified to species or genus and measured ( fork length)\n\nto the nearest millimeter.\n Partly digested fishes often were identified by their bone\n\nmorphology, as determined from a reference collection ( Hansel et al. 1988)\n\nwhen length could not be measured directly because of digestion, we estimated\n\nit from standard or nape-to-tail lengths or bone lengths ( Hansel et al.\n\n1988) with regression equations developed from whole specimens.\n Partly digested fish remains from more than one prey fish species\n\nwere weighed together and apportioned to each species on the basis of the\n\nextrapolated sizes of whole fish.\n When we could not estimate the relative sizes of each prey fish, we\n\ndivided the total weight of the parts equally among fish in the stomach.\n Parasites, non-food items, and unidentified materials were ignored in\n\ndietary calculations. \n\n  To determine if northern squawfish were feeding selectively on\n\ncertain sizes of juvenile salmonids, we compared the length frequencies of\n\njuvenile salmonids in the digestive tracts of northern squawfish to length\n\nfrequencies of those available in the environment during the same days\n\npredators were collected near the dam.\n Length data on salmonids from the environment were obtained from\n\nsmolt samples at the McNary Dam collection facility ( Paul Wagner, Washington\n\nDepartment of Fisheries, unpublished data); these data were continuous but\n\ngrouped, because smolts were sorted into groups by 10-mm increments and\n\nindividual measurements were not available.\n The length-frequency distributions were tested for independence with\n\nthe Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit test for continuous, group data ( Zar\n\n1984).\n Lengths of juvenile salmonids were pooled for all years by month\n\nbecause length distributions did not vary significantly among years.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0d978ff2-187d-41a9-b5f8-6c349b37d01a", "added":

{"text": "Dill worked in the produce section of our town 's biggest\n\nsupermarket.\n The store was the centerpiece of the town 's newest strip mall, which\n\nhad a bigger parking lot than the combined middle school/high school and\n\nwhich boasted beige walls made of textured concrete.\n Even when the snow drifts were piled three cars high, the walls\n\nreminded me of a huge Southwestern adobe hut. \n\n  I suspected that they looked nothing like adobe.\n Since I had never been to the Southwest, since all I knew of warm\n\nclimates and New Mexico and Arizona were the \" genuine Southwestern\n\nhand-tooled leather wear\" sold in another strip mall by a couple from\n\nVermont, plus whatever I had seen on TV, I suspected that I had rather\n\nadjusted my inner vision of the Southwest to match the beige concrete walls\n\nof this strip mall.\n That way, when I drove out in the middle of a blizzard to buy a can of\n\nblack beans, I could tell myself, \" I am going to bask in the image of warmer\n\nclimes,\" rather than, \" I am going on another useless errand to the grocery\n\nstore on the off-chance that I just might catch a glimpse of Dill rearranging\n\nthe swiss chard or carting out California oranges.\" \n\n  I parked.\n I entered the supermarket.\n I sauntered carefully through the aisles, ignoring the young women\n\nwith their whining, sticky-faced children, maneuvering aroung the old women\n\nwith their permanented thinning hair and their careful steps, occasionally\n\nducking behind a display of Super Value store-brand Cheetos so that I could\n\navoid my uncle.\n He was crazy and lonely, and he haunted the supermarkets and gas\n\nstations just so he would have someone to talk to.\n Holding my breath and trembling in the centers of my palms, I would\n\nfind myself in the produce section, gazing longingly at raddichio or\n\npondering the philosophical significance of parsnips. \n\n \n\n  Dill was the only woman in the store who wasn't a cashier or a\n\nmanager.\n She got her hands dirty; she lugged fifty-pound sacks of potatoes;\n\nshe wore a puke-green apron with fruit stains mashed into it.\n She politely ignored everyone who entered the store.\n She'd wo 'd the same pair of purple Converse for the past year and a\n\nhalf - - I watched them fade to from bright tropical punch to grayish-brown,\n\nsaw every new patch of duct tape appear.\n\n\n  She, too, reminded me of warmer climes.\n She had dark hair and dark skin and wore the same denim jacket in\n\neven the coldest weather.\n Sometimes I felt that if I could only walk up to her and hold my\n\nhands out to her as if she were a furnace, I could be warm forever.\n I once snuck into the employee 's back room and left her a genuine\n\nSouthwestern belt hand-tooled with a garish scene of adobe huts carved into a\n\ncliff face.\n I debated leaving a note: \" I love you, I noticed your old belt is\n\ngetting worn, and this made me think of you.\u001d\n But I thought she would not understand how I might equate this ugly\n\nbelt with her own warm beauty, and so I left without any comment. \n\n  It was with a sense of triumph over the world that I saw her\n\nbegin to wear it. \n\n  The snow started to melt, and I traded my coat, scarf, hat, and\n\ngloves for a grey wool blazer.\n None of my friends knew much about Dill.\n She had gone to school with us through junior high, and then she went\n\nto the county 's vocational/technical school.\n Jason 's little brother, who also went to vo/tech, had a few\n\nmetal-working classes with her.\n Jeff, who lived in the projects, said she lived a couple buildings\n\nover from him, but he'd 'dever really spoken to her.\n\n\n  I was accepted to college in California, and school ended.\n The night after graduation, my friends and I climbed onto the roof of\n\nthe school and got drunk.\n Sean almost fell off the roof while taking a leak; we almost got\n\narrested \n\n  I got a job for the summer in the comic book store just a few\n\nbuildings down from Dill 's supermarket. \n\n  Sometimes we ate lunch at the same time in the same Chinese food\n\nplace.\n I gazed her over my fried rice.\n She, too, ate fried rice, and always a bottle of Dr.\n Pepper.\n I remember that summer Dr.\n Pepper was in the middle of a long-running contest in which you could\n\nwin prizes written on the inside of the bottle caps, most often a free bottle\n\nof Dr.\n Pepper.\n A couple times I saw Dill pay for her drink with a bottle cap - - I\n\nthink it was the only time I ever saw anyone win anything from a contest.\n\n\n\n  One afternoon I was sitting on the curb to the parking lot,\n\nhaving finished my fried rice with five minutes left to my lunch half hour.\n I leaned back on my elbows and watched the sun reflect off the\n\nconcrete and car fenders, and I wondered if I might actually see a real\n\nrattlesnake in California.\n\n\n  A few minutes later she walked out again, swinging a bottle of\n\nDr.\n Pepper by her thigh.\n She sat down next to me, opened it, and took a swig.\n\n\n  I nodded.\n She handed it to me.\n I swallowed.\n In private, I had been practicing drinking Dr.\n Pepper.\n I had never really liked it, since the sweetness clogged up my throat\n\nand made me cough - - I was more of a grapefruit juice kind of person.\n But I wanted to like Dr.\n Pepper for thought of Dill.\n And now the sickly swallows were all worth it.\n I smiled at her.\n She smiled at me.\n\n\n  We squinted at the cars in the sun; I could almost feel that\n\nwarmth emanating from her skin.\n\n\n  She nodded, and as I walked the five stores down to my comic book\n\nstore, I wondered if she was watching me. \n\n  The night before I left for college, I dreamed of kissing her\n\ngoodbye, her skinny hips jutting through the thin denim of her jeans, her\n\nmouth tasting oddly of plums and Dr.\n Pepper.\n I woke up just before dawn and sat at my desk with a pen and a piece\n\nof notebook paper.\n Finally I wrote, \" Thank you for the Dr.\n Pepper.\n The belt was from me.\u001d\n It was seven o'clock.\n I drove to the supermarket and saw through the window that she was\n\nstocking red delicious apples.\n I parked and went inside and bought a bottle of Smokey Pete 's Red Hot\n\nSauce.\n Then I snuck into the back room and left the note and the hot sauce\n\nwaiting in the pocket of her faded denim jacket.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "bbdc6536-6387-4ed9-8ad6-01f0e9371da2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.850945+00:00"}

{"text": "Selective optical excitation permits both the group index and the\n\ngroup delay of on-axis modes of multimode fibers to be determined with high\n\nprecision.\n The group index of several types of fiber was measured at 1310 nm in a\n\nfiber Michelson interferometer and the values were tabulated.\n Group delays were obtained from the transit time of short-duration\n\noptical pulses.\n From these data the length of reference fibers ~2km long was\n\ncalculated.\n Length-measurement accuracy was limited by group-index uncertainties\n\nto ~0.04%.\n Also, a technique that uses these reference fibers to minimize\n\nuncertainties in distance measurements made with multimode\n\noptical-time-domain reflectometers is described.\n\n  Length measurements, multimode fiber length,\n\noptical-fiber group index, optical-fiber group delay, optical-fiber length,\n\noptical-time-domain reflectometer calibration.\n\n\n  In many ways the transmission properties of multi-mode optical\n\nfibers are more difficult to characterize precisely than are their\n\nsingle-mode counterparts.\n This is so because mode groups in the multimode fiber have slightly\n\ndifferent propagation properties.\n Mode-dependent complications are particularly evident in attempts to\n\nmeasure fiber length accurately by optical means.\n In this paper we examine a multimode optical-fiber-length metrology\n\nthat is based on selective mode excitation,1 a technique that has long been\n\nused to investigate differential mode properties, such as attenuation and\n\ndelay.2,3 This procedure is implemented most conveniently by exciting the\n\nmultimode test fiber with a single-mode launch fiber.\n As we will see, there are advantages to using this approach for both\n\ngroup-index and group-delay measurements.\n\n  The length of optical fibers that are a few kilometers long is\n\nusually measured in one of two ways: optically with transit-time and\n\ngroup-index information and mechanically with devices such as winding\n\nmachines.\n The optical approach, which is often the more accurate and certainly\n\nthe more versatile, makes use of the equation  , ( 1) where  c  is the velocity of light,  Tm  (\n\n X  ) is the group delay of a given mode group at a\n\nspecified wavelength, and  Nm  (  X  ) is the\n\ncorresponding group index.\n\n\nwill, in general, possess its own group delay and group index and that the\n\nvalues of these quantities will vary with wavelength.\n The variation in modal-group index causes a spread in the group delay\n\nand produces inter-modal pulse broadening.\n Mode coupling complicates this simple picture and is discussed in\n\nSubsection II.C.\n\n  Although fiber group index can be calculated from\n\nindex-of-refraction data,4 the most-accurate results must be obtained\n\nexperimentally.\n The most direct experimental method involves inverting Eq. ( 1).\n In this case a relatively short fiber ( a few tens of meters) of\n\nlength  L  is measured with a precise steel tape or other mechanical\n\nmeans, the group delay is determined optically, and  N  is inferred\n\nfrom these data.5 The accuracy can be improved with shuttle-pulse methods.6\n\nOther single-mode techniques that are based on interferometry and have the\n\ndesirable feature that they require only short samples, usually less than a\n\nmeter in length, have been described.7,8 Ordinarily we expect that multimode\n\nfibers will not be suitable in interferometric systems because the differing\n\nmodal transit times produce an output-speckle pattern and not the coherent\n\nphase front that is required for interference.\n However, this research demonstrates experimentally that an\n\ninterferometric technique can be extended to multimode fibers under suitable\n\nlaunch conditions, particularly when the on-axis mode groups behave much as\n\none would expect from a single-mode fiber.\n\n  An effective or average group delay in a fiber can be measured\n\ndirectly by the transit time of a short-duration optical pulse4 or indirectly\n\nwith rf phase techniques.9 Procedures that restrict optical power\n\ntransmission to a few low-order modes in multimode fibers are more consistent\n\nwith the pulse time-of-flight method.\n In this case the output-pulse duration and delay uncertainty can be\n\nsubstantially reduced below those obtained from overfilled launch\n\nconditions.\n\n  In this paper procedures and results of on-axis group-index and\n\ngroup-delay measurements are discussed for several types of multimode fiber\n\nnear the zero-dispersion wavelength ( nominally 1310 nm).\n This information is used to determine the length of reference fibers\n\nthat can be used for improving distance-measuring accuracy in multimode\n\noptical-time-domain reflectometers(OTDR 's).\n\n\n\n  The experimental apparatus for making group-index measurements is\n\nillustrated in Fig. 1 and is similar to the one described elsewhere for\n\nsingle-mode use.8\n The multimode fiber samples, ~0.l m long, were inserted into the test\n\narm of the interferometer.\n The scanning and test arms of the interferometer, as well as the 3-dB\n\ndirectional coupler, were constructed from single-mode fiber.\n The source consisted of a light-emitting diode with a FWHM spectral\n\nwidth of 180 nm centered at 1300 nm.\n The single-mode launch fiber was positioned by a micromanipulator to\n\nproduce a maximum signal from the Fresnel reflection at the far end of the\n\nsample.\n This signal occurs when the launch and the test fibers are coaxial.\n The reference arm was translated by a stepping motor for coarse\n\nadjustments and a linearized piezoelectric transducer for the fine\n\npositioning between steps.\n The cat 's-eye arrangement in the reference arm was optically stable\n\nover the ~0.15-m travel required for coherence coincidence.\n N\n\n =  N  air L  air/  L  f.(2)\n\n  air is the distance that the scanning mirror is\n\nmoved in air as determined by the separation of the interferogram envelope\n\nmaxima that arises from the sample-end reflections.\n f is the physical length of the fiber and is measured\n\nwith a calibrated traveling microscope.\n The group index of air is, within 1.3 parts in 106, equal to the\n\nindex of refraction.\n\n\nN  air is ~1.000273 at 1300 nm.10\n\n  Figure 2 shows the appearance of some of the interferograms\n\ncorresponding to reflections from remote ends of the test fibers.\n The structure observed in some of the signatures is presumably due to\n\nmodal effects, but in all cases an unequivocal maximum can be identified for\n\nuse as a reference point.  B. Group-Index Measurements \n\n  The on-axis group indices were determined for a total of 12\n\nfibers from 2 manufacturers.\n All four types of multimode fiber recognized by the Electronic\n\nIndustries Association11 are included.\n A sample from each end of the 12 reels was selected so some\n\nindication of the uniformity of the fiber could be obtained ( see Subsection\n\nII.C).\n Some average values for particular types are summarized in Table I.\n Also included are two single-mode values.\n The fibers labeled C were obtained from Corning Glass Works, and\n\nthose labeled A were from AT&T.\n\n\n  The group delay was measured with the time-of-flight apparatus\n\nillustrated in Fig. 3.\n A single-mode fiber was used to inject optical power from a\n\npulsed-laser diode into the multimode test fiber.\n Alignment with a micromanipulator ensured approximate coincidence of\n\nthe optical axes of the transmitting and receiving fibers.\n Fine tuning of the coupling was accomplished by maximizing the\n\namplitude of the output optical pulse displayed on a sampling oscilloscope.\n The fiber lead-in to the photodetector was multimode, and under these\n\nconditions it was possible, through misalignment, to excite a number of mode\n\ngroups.\n However, with the criterion of maximum-output pulse amplitude,\n\ncoupling to the test fiber was unambiguous and always occurred with the\n\nsingle-mode launch fiber at a position near the central axis of the test\n\nfiber.\n\n  Some of the restricted-launch pulse shapes are illustrated\n\nschematically in Fig. 4.\n It is of interest to compare these pulse durations with those\n\nexpected from their nominal bandwidths.\n A great simplification can be made at this point by assuming Gaussian\n\npulse shapes, a condition that is obviously not exactly fulfilled in some of\n\nthe examples.\n T\n\n F can be expressed as  T  F = 0.44/ B  , where  B\n\n is the 3-dB optical bandwidth.12 These values are listed along with the\n\nobserved single-mode launched-pulse durations  T  R in Table II.\n The values in column 5 have been corrected for the finite width of\n\nthe input pulse  T  IN, according to the approximation  T \n\n2OUT =  TR  2+  T  2IN.\n When the single-mode launch conditions are used, output-pulse\n\ndurations are shorter, from 3 to 33, than those expected from the nominal\n\nbandwidths.\n R is, within a factor of 2, the same for all\n\ntypes of fiber.\n Also, the larger cores are not always correlated with a larger\n\nbandwidth or with TR.\n\n\n  Because only small test segments at either end of the test fiber\n\ncan be sampled, it is necessary to assume that these values are\n\nrepresentative of the entire length.\n These sampling errors constitute a significant portion of the total\n\nerror budget for length measurements.\n Some results of studies of the uniformity of group index in\n\nsingle-mode fibers have been reported.5,7 Saunders andGardner7 showed that a\n\ncertain class of production fiber exhibited group indices that were uniform\n\nwithin 0.02% with fiber-to-fiber variations <0.03% (1  (  ) .\n .5 conducted a similar, though much\n\nless detailed, study of another class of single-mode fiber and found that\n\nfiber-to-fiber  N  limits were confined to 0.04% for six fibers.\n To the author 's knowledge, no corresponding studies have been made of\n\nmultimode fibers.\n In the present investigation there were insufficient data for a\n\ndetailed statistical analysis of fiber uniformity, so only some brief\n\nobservations will be noted.\n The differences in group-index values from either end of a given 2-km\n\nreel of fiber had a standard deviation of 0.012%, whereas average values\n\nobtained from different reels ( of a similar type) had a standard deviation\n\nof 0.08%.\n It appears, then, that there is somewhat greater variability in the\n\nproperties of multimode fibers compared with their single-mode counterparts.\n In any event, for maximum-length accuracy, the group index of each\n\nfiber must be measured individually.\n\n  Both temperature variations and stress have well-documented\n\neffects on length, group delay, and group index.5,13 For bulk silica the\n\ntemperature coefficient of thermal expansion is ~6 x 10-7 K-1 at room\n\ntemperature.\n Fractional optical-delay change is a combination of both index and\n\nlength effects and is of the order of 8 x 10-6 K-1.\n A stress of 1 MN/m2 ( 140 psi) produces a strain of ~1.4 x 10-5 and a\n\nfractional delay of 1.0 x 10-5.\n The use of a collapsing fiber reel with subsequent potting in\n\nsilicone rubber can largely eliminate winding stress for the group-delay\n\nmeasurements.\n\n  precision, or repeatability, of\n\ngroup-index values   (  N/N  is estimated to be\n\n~6 x 10-5 and consists of traveling microscope errors, random errors, and\n\ntemperature effects.\n N/N\n\n is ~4 x 10-4 and includes sampling uncertainties and other effects,\n\nsuch as nonlinearity in the lead screw ( which can be much reduced with\n\ninterferometric control).\n This figure was calculated by linearly adding worst-case systematic\n\nerrors to the total 2- random error.\n\n  The group-delay precision is much better, ~3 x 10-6 for a 2-km\n\nfiber.\n , which\n\nincludes random errors, line-center estimate variations, time-interval\n\nerrors, and temperature effects, is ~2.3 x 10-5\n\n  The total uncertainties in length measurements are dominated by\n\nthe group-index errors,   (  L/L = N/N  or ~4 x\n\n10-4.\n\n\n  For maximum accuracy in the delay values, the power launched into\n\na particular mode group should continue to propagate in that same group as\n\nthe radiation traverses the length of the light guide.\n Fore the fibers examined in this study the mode coupling seems to be\n\nsmall because the output-pulse shapes are not distorted greatly after 2 km.\n Even more convincing evidence of low-mode coupling may be obtained\n\nfrom OTDR scans, since OTDR can provide information on the evolution of the\n\npower distribution as the optical pulse progresses along the fiber.14\n\n  The OTDR scans shown in Fig. 5 were obtained with a reflectometer\n\ndesigned for single-mode operation.\n The output port was connected to a 2-km single-mode fiber pigtail\n\nthat was used to launch the probe pulse into the multimode fiber.\n The transmitting and receiving fibers were butt coupled with their\n\naxis collinear, a configuration that produced the maximum-backscatter signal\n\nresponse.\n The backscatter trace on the left of each scan represents the\n\nRayleigh Scatter from the single-mode launch fiber, and the segment with the\n\nincreased slope is due to the multimode fiber.\n The increased slope is due to the higher doping levels and,\n\nconsequently, higher loss of the multimode fiber.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "The dilemma was whether to take the train or the bus.\n Her bag was too heavy, she realized that several blocks after she left\n\nthe house.\n The bus would smell awful, and she would get motion sick, and the bag\n\nwould have to be stowed in the stomach at the side of the bus so she would\n\nhave to rummage through it and dig out all the things she might possibly want\n\nand put them in a plastic which sooner or later would tear and then all the\n\nsmall sharp things would spill out and get lost in her clothes and seat and\n\njab her suddenly, and at least one bottle or jar of something that could come\n\nundone would.\n But the bus was cheaper.\n\n\n  The train would be fast, and clean, and she probably wouldn't get\n\nmotion sick and could move around if she did, and entertain herself on the\n\nobservation car or in the lounge car if she could eat or drink.\n There would be the odd compact little bathroom just small enough to\n\nmake sure everything got wet when water splashed out of the tiny wash basin,\n\nand the crumbly crackers and sharp processed cheese she would buy for herself\n\nin lieu of more expensive lunch offerings, and the dinner, with its paper and\n\nplastic fantaglia, and the overall nostalgia, elegant sentimental aura of\n\ntrains - - legacy of hundreds of crowded, lively trains in 1940 's movies, and\n\nsleek, satin and clever talk and porter trains of 1930 's movies, and the\n\ntrains of novels and short stories.\n But the train was more expensive.\n\n\n  The bag was too heavy to keep carrying and too heavy to keep\n\nguarding.\n Saving money was always a good plan.\n But it would be nice to have money when she got there, enough to\n\ncasually treat him, take his sister to the toy store and buy her something\n\nfrivolous and charming, take his mother to lunch, assert, somehow, that\n\nthough she was the guest, and though she was being looked over, and though\n\nthey were putting her up and feeding her, and though she wasn't from an old\n\nor famous family, and though she couldn't smooth the edges of things with the\n\ngleamy patina of money F. Scott Fitzgerald described with the exactness and\n\ntenderness of infatuation, still, she could be polite and take bloody care of\n\nherself and pay back their offerings so no one, no one would think she owed\n\nthem any god-damned thing or snub her with it. \n\n  But arriving later.\n And disheveled, and quite probably motion sick.\n Well, she was Irish.\n She'd lo 'd interesting pale - - the elaborate bone structure must be\n\ngood for something.\n What if something happened.\n She could get him a present.\n She took the bus.\n\n\n  When she was a child, people around her bought each other\n\npresents.\n She read about it in books, how one shopped for hours or suddenly\n\ncame upon it, the present.\n A sudden perfect repository of the complex yes 's and no 's, a delicate\n\nchimera of the sweeps and glitters and smooth curves of unimaginable,\n\ntoo-quick-in-motion returned affection, the richness of that lushly\n\nunpredictable exchange, unchanneled by the awful, usual grooves of\n\ndefensiveness, dullness, distance and not closeness.\n She never got to get anyone presents - - her siblings were cold and\n\nunaffectionate and uninterested in her, and her mother made a fetish out of\n\ndisliking her choices and her father was too shy and distant, made too\n\nuncomfortable by gifts.\n And she had no friends back then, no close friends, certainly no one\n\nlike the friends she read about in books.\n She got occasional duty gifts for people, those surface nods to the\n\nconventions of days when one bought things, but such exchanges were without\n\njoy.\n The few times she had thought she might be in the middle of a real\n\npresent, the person turned out to be only being polite, or not want to\n\nembarrass her but she hangs on and no one likes her, or the recipient was - -\n\nand she'd 'down it all along but pretended for a little out of loneliness - -\n\nnot the right angle to her to understand gifts.\n The offering of good will and companionship is generous - - something\n\nshe recognized more as a glimpse into some life or order she had lost but\n\nwhich was the final thing humans were meant to attain.\n But however kindly meant, and generously given, seen from the wrong\n\nangle a soul is one-dimensional and flat, and a flat soul is a flat soul is a\n\nflat soul is a flat soul like Gertrude Stein 's rose; itself, the cliche,\n\nendlessly and unavoidably the cliche in the context of the hot-press plastic\n\nmold that makes each part of the conversation just exactly what one would\n\nexpect it to be based on what one was told on T.V., radio, the movies,\n\nmagazines, newspapers, it ought to be. \n\n  Then the move out of the nervous town haunted by her implacable\n\ndifference from everyone else.\n And finally, conversations she couldn't predict in a context of\n\nshared interests when no one involved was uneasy about her.\n People who liked to talk about books, art, ideas not automatically\n\nrequired to be certified by The Group as acceptable before they could be\n\narticulated.\n And then the lover.\n And then, oh, the presents.\n The glorious texture surely he, whose hands could return in such awe\n\nto her skin, whose eyes so beautifully changed the color of a shirt from dull\n\nto an extraordinary variation on blue, surely he would recognize. \n\n  Exchanging in a language not a language but light illuminating\n\nand triggering the locks on doors to rooms she hadn't thought of, the\n\nshorthand for how beautiful a shiny surface could be, how like his eyes the\n\ncolors swirling through the rock were, how much a miracle it was that an\n\nagate could hold in just its shapes and cloudings exactly the sensation of\n\none of those summer storms which so exactly corresponded to the feeling just\n\nbefore joining in lovemaking, that demi-second of looking in the lover 's eyes\n\nand knowing you are just about to do something together that will be of all\n\nworlds simultaneously and yes, yes come in and he is coming in and there is\n\nanother human being inside of me it is he of the beautiful unexpected eyes\n\nand his hands I cannot predict and he is saying something lovely, yes, and\n\nkissing my cheekbone that way of his, and now it is happening, this thing I\n\nhave read of and wanted and not quite believed could really occur ( two\n\npeople would never risk themselves with each other this way); the sad,\n\nintimate, richly colored swirls of stone, and eyes, and just before.\n The presents, finally, the giving of real presents and one quickened\n\nenough to know them.\n\n\n  It arrived even later than the tiresome timetable and there was\n\nno one waiting.\n She had looked forward to someone waiting - - it was another thing,\n\nlike the presents, she' 'dread about and lived among but never gotten to have,\n\nsomeone waiting for her, someone real, waiting for really-her, not their\n\nfantasy of 'I'm a 'mgnificant guy now because I saw this woman who looks\n\nimpressively like the important-young-man-appeal magazine ads and I conquered\n\nher, I, and now the pictures in the magazine are like me and everyone will\n\nlook at me and think I, too, am an important young man.'\n No, he talked to really her, real time, exactly her and liked her\n\nbecause he hadn't extravagantly at first, just a little, a promising amount.\n And they' 'dtalked, and played together, and the liking grew, fed on\n\nreal things exactly corresponding, not his imagined versions of what he was\n\ntold would make him important.\n And he was going to be waiting, scrunched in his silly car looking a\n\nlittle shy and then excited to see her and they would snicker a little at the\n\nextravagance and visibility of it all, but it would be lovely and he would be\n\nwaiting and there would be a little privacy before the sizing up and the\n\nfamily and the intrusion of people she didn't know most likely expecting\n\nsomething from her, which always set her back up which would necessitate the\n\nelaborate smoothing down of patience over the top of her conversation and\n\nresponse.\n Only no one was there.\n\n\n  They had agreed, two weeks ago, that she would come down to visit\n\nhim, had set the day she would leave, the probable time she would arrive.\n She had called, and left a message on his answering machine at the\n\napartment in the city.\n And she had, shyly, called the number of the island that he' 'dwritten\n\ndown for her on a scrap of paper from the jumble on his desk, and a woman had\n\nanswered, and in a terrible shyness lest this was the mother and she would be\n\nmeant to say something to her only she didn't know her and wanted to be left\n\nalone, she' 'dsaid in few words her name, and the bus she was on, and when it\n\nwas arriving.\n But no one was there.\n Perhaps she was meant to go to his house.\n But she didn't know where it was.\n She could take a taxi -

{"text": "Fiscal 2005 was a year of continued solid, balanced growth for\n\nCisco from both a product- and market-leadership perspective.\n We achieved an outstanding financial performance with record profits\n\nand cash generation, year-over-year growth in our core routing and switching\n\nproducts, and very strong growth in our six advanced technologies.\n Our enterprise, service provider, and commercial customer market\n\nsegments all experienced solid year-over-year growth.\n However, the highlight for the year was the balance that we achieved\n\nacross our geographies, customer market segments, architectural evolutions,\n\nand product families.\n We believe our financial strength, product leadership, and global\n\nreach uniquely position Cisco as a company not only built to last, but built\n\nto lead. \n\n\n  In our opinion, the key to long-term success in the\n\nhigh-technology industry is ongoing strategic investment and innovation, and\n\nwe intend to continue to take good business risks.\n Our innovation strategy requires a unique combination of internal\n\ndevelopment, partnerships, and acquisitions.\n In our opinion, for companies to lead in the technology industry they\n\nmust be able to do all three.\n We continue to believe that our industry will consolidate and that\n\nthe consolidation will occur along both technology and business architecture\n\nlines.\n This technology architecture will probably evolve where the seven\n\nlayers of the Open Systems Interconnection ( OSI) stack are first loosely,\n\nthen tightly coupled.\n That is exactly where you see us taking the integration of our core\n\nand advanced technology product architectures.\n Equally important, companies also have to gain the confidence of\n\ntheir customers from a vision and strategy perspective, a product\n\narchitecture leadership perspective, and a service and support perspective.\n We think we are very uniquely positioned to continue to win the\n\nhearts, minds, and capital investments of our customers. \n\n  In fiscal 2005 we invested more than\n\n&dollar;3.3 billion in research and development ( R&D).\n This resulted in more than 50 product introductions and the\n\nnumber-one market share leadership position in most of our product\n\ncategories, including our advanced technology markets, truly demonstrating\n\nthat the investments we made three to five years ago are now paying off.\n We believe this product momentum will continue in fiscal 2006, and we\n\nwill do our best to continue to meet and exceed the expectations of our\n\ncustomers and partners. \n\n\n  In fiscal 2005 we achieved record performance across almost all\n\nof our financial and operational metrics.\n Fiscal 2005 revenue was\n\n&dollar;24.8 billion, compared to fiscal 2004 revenue of\n\n&dollar;22.0 billion.\n Net income on a generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP)\n\nbasis was\n\n&dollar;5.7 billion, compared to fiscal 2004 GAAP net income of\n\n&dollar;4.4 billion.\n GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for fiscal 2005 were\n\n&dollar;0.87, compared to\n\n&dollar;0.62 for fiscal 2004.\n In addition to net income, Cisco generated\n\n&dollar;7.6 billion in cash, highlighting the ongoing quality of our earnings. \n\n  Cisco demonstrated solid execution on its three long-term\n\nfinancial priorities.\n First, we continued to focus on profitable growth with GAAP net\n\nincome as a percentage of revenue exceeding 20 percent.\n During fiscal 2005, we increased revenue year over year by\n\napproximately 12.5 percent.\n Of total revenue, approximately\n\n&dollar;20.9 billion was related to product revenue and\n\n&dollar;3.9 billion was related to service revenue.\n Our revenue growth is the result of a continued recovery in the\n\nglobal IT economic environment, and we achieved significant market share\n\ngains in many product areas. \n\n  Second, we increased our profitability.\n We increased GAAP net income by 30 percent and GAAP earnings per\n\nshare by 40 percent during fiscal 2005, while operating expenses decreased by\n\n3 percent as a percentage of revenue. \n\n  A key competitive advantage for Cisco is how we use our own\n\ntechnology to drive productivity.\n We achieved a key metric by reaching our productivity goal of\n\napproximately\n\n&dollar;700,000 in annualized revenue per employee, up from approximately\n\n&dollar;450,000 in fiscal 2001 when the goal was set.\n This is significant given that we also increased headcount in fiscal\n\n2005 by 12 percent, primarily in sales and R&D.\n Our profitability far exceeded our revenue growth rate and is\n\nevidence of our ability to drive productivity and operational efficiency.\n\n\n\n  Third, we maintained our strong and conservative balance sheet,\n\nwhile aggressively reducing outstanding shares through our share repurchase\n\nprogram.\n At the end of fiscal 2005, cash and investments totaled\n\n&dollar;16.1 billion, days sales outstanding ( DSOs) were 31, and annualized\n\ninventory turns were 6.6.\n During fiscal 2005, we repurchased\n\n&dollar;10.2 billion, or 540 million shares of our stock.\n Cash used for these repurchases was generated primarily through\n\noperations.\n At the end of fiscal 2005, our cumulative purchases since the\n\ninception of the share repurchase program in September 2001 were\n\napproximately\n\n&dollar;27.2 billion, or 1.5 billion shares, at an average price of\n\n&dollar;18.15.  This is a decrease of more than 13 percent in the weighted\n\naverage diluted shares outstanding since the inception of the program.\n The program 's remaining approved repurchase amount is approximately\n\n&dollar;7.8 billion. \n\n  Our strong cash position provides investment opportunities for\n\nCisco. The Board of Directors routinely evaluates growth and technology\n\nleadership objectives with the goal of providing an attractive return on\n\ninvestment for our shareholders. Our technology investments are designed to\n\nextend our current product leadership through new offerings, as well as\n\nfeature and functionality enhancements.\n We believe these investments will allow us to capitalize on new\n\nadvanced technologies and emerging geographic markets.\n These investments include areas such as enterprise IP communications,\n\nnetwork security, and wireless networking.\n We believe ongoing strategic investments, along with our share\n\nrepurchase program and strong cash balance, are in the best interest of Cisco\n\nand our shareholders. \n\n\n  Cisco 's success in fiscal 2005 can be attributed to the balance\n\nachieved in almost all of our product families, customer market segments, and\n\ngeographies.\n This, combined with our ability to continuously innovate and expand\n\nthe industry and our markets, is a significant driver of our success. \n\n  In fiscal 2005, Cisco 's six advanced technologies showed the\n\nhighest revenue growth of our product groups.\n Revenue from advanced technologies increased 32 percent year over\n\nyear to\n\n&dollar;4.4 billion.\n The six advanced technologies include: enterprise IP communications,\n\nhome networking, optical networking, security, storage area networking, and\n\nwireless technology.\n During fiscal 2005, security and enterprise IP communications\n\nachieved our initial goal of an annual revenue run rate of approximately\n\n&dollar;1 billion.\n We shipped our 6-millionth IP phone.\n We continue to expand our advanced technologies and have set an\n\naggressive goal of announcing several new advanced technologies in fiscal\n\n2006. \n\n  This year we introduced the integrated services router, one of\n\nthe industry 's most comprehensive enterprise solutions for branch offices.\n The integrated services router is designed to allow customers to\n\ncustomize solutions by adding security, voice, and wireless capabilities to a\n\nsingle routing platform.\n In our core switching families, we made five key product\n\nannouncements in fiscal 2005, and Cisco 's switching products continue to\n\nmaintain a number-one market share position. \n\n  We also experienced balance across all key customer market\n\nsegments, with solid growth in the service provider, enterprise, and\n\ncommercial segments.\n Our consumer-oriented Linksys division had the highest annual growth\n\nby market segment of approximately 40 percent year over year.\n In terms of our balance among Cisco 's five geographic areas in fiscal\n\n2005, we experienced strong product revenue growth in almost all of our\n\ngeographies, increasing total product revenue by 12 percent on an annual\n\nbasis.\n\n  We were also very pleased with our ability to enter new markets\n\nand gain leadership from both a market share and innovation perspective.\n As mentioned earlier, we believe innovation comes from a combination\n\nof internal development, partnerships, and acquisitions.\n In terms of key strategic alliances, we accelerated our growth\n\nopportunities with our strategic partners.\n In fiscal 2005, we continued our strategy of taking good, solid\n\nbusiness risks by completing 17 acquisitions to further extend our talent and\n\ntechnology opportunities for both our core routing and switching products as\n\nwell as our advanced technologies.\n We believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of future growth\n\nopportunities, and we are confident and optimistic about the areas of the\n\nbusiness that we can control and influence.\n We intend to continue to add both engineering and sales resources as\n\nwe focus on developing the next wave of advanced technologies, growing the\n\ncommercial market segment, capitalizing on our emerging market opportunities,\n\nand increasing our market share gains. \n\n\n  An integral part of Cisco 's business strategy is corporate\n\ncitizenship.\n We believe this is not only the right thing to do, but is also just\n\nplain \" good business.\"\n We employ and advocate responsible business practices and programs,\n\nwhich builds a lasting trust with our key stakeholders' customers, partners,\n\nemployees, and shareholders.\n In the fall of 2005, Cisco will release its first Corporate Social\n\nResponsibility Report, which will be available\n\natwww.cisco.com/go/citizenship. \n\n  We are dedicated to sustaining a diverse, inclusive workforce.\n We employ responsible operations, product stewardship, and\n\nenvironmentally friendly design policies, and we encourage our suppliers to\n\nadhere to these standards.\n Cisco is committed to sound and transparent corporate governance and\n\nfinancial disclosure practices.\n Our Website provides Cisco 's corporate governance policies and\n\npractices, corporate citizenship programs, and financial information. \n\n  Cisco is also committed to education.\n We have Networking Academies in more than 160 countries, with\n\napproximately 10,000 academies and 420,000 students.\n Students in high schools, technical schools, colleges, and community\n\norganizations learn hands-on networking skills to prepare for the workforce\n\nof today and the future.\n The Jordan Education Initiative, spearheaded by Cisco in partnership\n\nwith the World Economic Forum and several other organizations, has created a\n\nreplicable model and is expanding its interactive e-curriculum-based\n\neducation programs into other geographic areas.  In the area of\n\ngiving back, employees celebrated Cisco 's 20th anniversary by donating more\n\nthan 20 years' worth of community service hours, or 235,000 hours far\n\nexceeding the goal of 175,200.\n During a time of global need, Cisco and our employees donated more\n\nthan\n\n&dollar;4 million in relief efforts for the South Asia tsunami victims.\n We are truly proud to be a part of a strong culture of giving back\n\nand social responsibility. \n\n\n  In fiscal 2005, we made evolutionary changes that support our\n\nlong-term strategy.\n We announced a reorganization of our geographic segments to better\n\naddress our global approach and focus on key growth areas.\n We evolved our engineering and sales leadership, demonstrating our\n\ncontinued bench strength and investment in future opportunities.\n Our ability to implement these changes smoothly is one of our core\n\ncompetencies. \n\n  Fiscal 2005 marked the end of our 20th anniversary, and on August\n\n10, 2005, more than 3,000 employees participated in the \" Virtual Opening\" of\n\nThe NASDAQ Stock Market at Cisco 's headquarters.\n This historical virtual opening bell ceremony showcased the power of\n\nnetworking technology, demonstrated how a stock market can be opened anytime,\n\nanywhere, eliminating distance and time restrictions, and reiterated Cisco 's\n\ncommitment to technology and innovation leadership. \n\n  Looking ahead, we believe that Cisco 's unique balance of\n\nfinancial strength, product leadership, and global presence truly position us\n\nas a company that is not only built to last, but built to lead.\n We would like to recognize the contributions of Don Valentine and Jim\n\nGibbons for their years of service to Cisco 's Board of Directors, and on\n\nbehalf of the Board, we would like to thank our customers, partners,\n\nemployees, and shareholders for their continued confidence and support.\n\n\n\n  We are pleased with our strong performance in fiscal 2004 and\n\nbelieve the investments we made 12 to 36 months ago are paying off in terms\n\nof our business and financial metrics.\n Going into fiscal 2005, we will continue to focus on our three major\n\ngrowth areas of core routing and switching, service provider, and Advanced\n\nTechnologies, as well as network architecture evolution expectations and a\n\ncontinued focus on profit contribution. \n\n  For 20 years, Cisco 's strategy has included an intense focus on\n\nresults, catching market transitions, and listening to our customers.\n We helped build the foundation of the Internet by building the\n\nrouters and switches that fueled it, and we believe that the best is yet to\n\ncome in terms of increases in productivity and standard of living that can be\n\ncreated from technology innovation from companies such as Cisco. \n\n  We are confident that Cisco is a company that is built to last,\n\nand on behalf of our Board of Directors, we would like to thank our\n\ncustomers, partners, employees, and shareholders for your continued\n\nconfidence and support.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8a768324-575d-4388-bc9a-996fac239fe8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.855644+00:00"}

five hundred dollars on\n\nclothes when my rent wasn't paid.\"\n Finally, she got help from a financial counselor and started paying\n\noff her\n\n&dollar;10,000 debt.\n Today she spends very

dollars.\n\n\n  Five-year plan: \" I'd like to buy a home, 'dnd have savings in a\n\nretirement fund that are accessible.\" \n\n  When it comes to money, most of us can probably see a little of\n\nourselves in these four women.\n Whether it 's buying an expensive jacket on a whim, watching unopened\n\nbills gather dust ( and interest due) or keeping savings in a checking\n\naccount, many women have been there.\n So how do these typical women stand up to the scrutiny of financial\n\nexperts? \n\n  \" Ann Marie, like a lot of women at twenty-six, just isn't paying\n\nattention to money, says Shelby White, author of What Every Woman Should Know\n\nAbout Her Husband 's Money ( Turtle Bay Books, 1992).\n \" She has a good salary, but it isn't reflected at all in her\n\nsavings.\"\n \" Ann Marie needs to make a lifestyle change,\" says Frances Leonard,\n\nauthor of Women & Money.\n An Independent Woman 's Guide to Financial Security For Life (\n\nAddison-Wesley, 1991).\n \" She simply must learn to say, 'Maybe I'll skip that potte 'llclass\n\nthis year.'\"\n\n  Because she clearly has no real interest in bargains--\"She didn't\n\nwant to go out of her way to get those cheaper tights, and that was a real\n\nsavings,\" Leonard notes-Ann Marie should find out if her company offers a\n\nvoluntary long-term savings plan.\n Under these plans, called 401(k)s, companies automatically deduct\n\nsavings from a weekly paycheck and then match that money with their own. \n\n  \" These are a very smart idea for anyone,\" Leonard explains, \"\n\nbecause the money isn't taxed.\n If you earn eighteen thousand dollars a year, and contribute two\n\nthousand dollars to the savings plan, you'll only be taxed f 'lla\n\nsixteen-thousand-dollar income.\" \n\n  Many young people avoid these plans because the money is not\n\nsupposed to be touched until the age of 591/2, at which time the money is\n\ntaxed.\n \" But,\" as Leonard points out, \" even if you pay the ten-percent\n\npenalty to withdraw money early, you've still saved a great 'vel over the\n\nyears in tax breaks.\" \n\n  If Ann Marie 's company doesn't offer a 401(k) plan, Leonard\n\nsuggests opening an IRA(Individual Retirement Account).\n They are a good way to start long-term savings ( also not to be\n\ntouched until retirement), but the money that 's invested isn't always\n\ntax-deductible. \n\n  Everyone worried about Ann Marie 's tendency to pay bills late,\n\nand suggested she obtain a copy of her credit report ( as of May, anyone can\n\nget one free report annually from TRW, a national credit reporting agency,\n\n800-392-1122).\n \" Ultimately, she could be hurting her ability to borrow money for a\n\nhouse,\" warns Leonard.\n The only way to fix a bad credit history is to keep a perfect record\n\nfor seven years, so the sooner Ann Marie finds out if there 's a problem, the\n\nbetter. \n\n  \" I love the way she did her homework' and read that money book,\"\n\nsays White about Maggie Drucker.\n \" She 's frugal,\" agrees Leonard, \" and it helps her.\"\n But even Maggie 's finances could he improved.\n At\n\n&dollar;1,200 a month, her rent far exceeds the rule that only a quarter of monthly\n\ntake-home salary go toward housing.\n\n\n  If Maggie 's parents don't greatly need the tax break, Leonard\n\nsuggests that she take over her own mortgage.\n \" That tax savings would be the money that she 's now having trouble\n\nputting away,\" she says. \n\n  But most importantly, Maggie should change the way she has\n\ninvested her savings.\n Currently she has\n\n&dollar;8,000 in money market accounts and\n\n&dollar;8,000 divided among three mutual funds.\n \" Maggie 's being much too conservative,\" Leonard says, citing the low\n\ninterest most money-market accounts pay.\n Instead, she recommends Maggie keep only 10 percent of her savings in\n\nmoney-market accounts.\n The rest should be in relatively safe mutual funds, and a quarter\n\nshould he in a more risky stock fund.\n \" That might be tough for her psychologically, because you have to\n\nride the ups and downs of the stock market,\" says Leonard, \" but she 's young,\n\nshe should be aggresive and steel her heart to do it.\" \n\n  For women like Maggie who have some money to invest, the experts\n\nsuggest no-load mutual funds, which don't require any fees to join.\n For information about no-load funds, the experts recommend a highly\n\nreadable\n\n&dollar;5 booklet published by Mutual Fund Education Alliance, 1900 Erie Street,\n\nSuite 120, Kansas City, MO64116. \n\n  Everyone agrees that Melissa Waksman is doing a good job of\n\npaying off a formidable\n\n&dollar;35,000 in student loans, but they also think she could be saving a lot more.\n Anita Jones-Lee, the author of Women and Money: A Guide for the ' 90s\n\n( Barrolls Educational Series, Inc., 1991) suggests melting some of those\n\nfive credit cards she now holds.\n \" Ideally, she should just keep one and pay it off every month,\" she\n\nsays.\n \" In general, store charge cards are redundant they charge higher\n\ninterest rates, and the stores usually take bank credit cards anyway.\" \n\n  Melissa should also shop around to make sure she 's getting the\n\nbest possible rate on her credit cards.\n Right now, she 's using one that charges 19-percent interest when she\n\ncould find one that charges 12 percent.\n Jones-Lee suggests calling the Bankcard Holders of America,\n\n703-481-1110, a nonprofit organization based in Herndon, Virginia, for a list\n\nof banks and the rates that they charge. \n\n  Nobody found fault with Melissa for her\n\n&dollar;2,500 Tahitian vacation.\n In fact, they admired her for realizing that she needed it.\n Leonard thought she might cut down on the impulsive weekend trips,\n\nbut otherwise the experts found her spending habits to be under control. \n\n  At least two of the experts compared Sara Franklyn 's\n\nrelationship with money to that of a dieter who can't control her eating.\n Sara is the high earner in the group, but she needs to resolve her\n\nconflicts about discipline and spending.\n As one expert put it, \" If you're mak 're one hundred thousand\n\ndollars a year, you shouldn't be afraid to window-shop.\" \n\n  Everyone agreed, however, that Sara 's biggest concern should be\n\navoiding taxes.\n If she bought a house, as she says she would like to, she could\n\nwrite off her mortgage interest, but the experts were surprisingly cautious\n\nabout real estate as an investment.\n While it 's true that real-estate prices have dropped and interest\n\nrates are low, there 's still no guarantee that your investment will\n\nappreciate in the long run. \n\n  A far better investment for a self-employed person with a high\n\nincome is a Keogh savings plan, where taxes can be deferred until she reaches\n\n591/2 years of age.\n As a self-employed person, Sara also needs to be especially careful\n\nabout putting money aside in case of an emergency.\n\n\n  If telling someone with minimal savings to spend less on eating\n\nout or clothing doesn't sound like a revelation, the financial experts are\n\nthe first to admit it.\n The hard part, they say, isn't understanding their advice, but\n\nconvincing women to follow it.\n But money isn't always a rational subject.\n \" Look at Ann Marie,\" says White.\n \" You would think someone who works as a financial researcher at a\n\nbank would pay the same attention to her personal balance sheet.\" \n\n  \" Many women act as if real life hasn't really begun, as if what\n\nthey're 'reng is just temporary,\" Leonard says.\n \" I realize it 's very difficult in your twenties or early thirties\n\nto think about how your finances will be when you're 'refty-nine, but you will\n\nbe that age someday.\"\n And Leonard points out that women on average spend one third more\n\nyears in retirement than men, still don't make as much money as men do and\n\noften end up having to take care of themselves. \n\n  If those facts are dreary, there is a more positive incentive to\n\nbegin saving now.\n Assuming a return of 9 percent, a woman who invests\n\n&dollar;l00 every month starting at the age of 25 will have\n\n&dollar;66,790 by the time she 's 45.\n A woman who starts saving the same amount every month at 35 wilt\n\nhave only\n\n&dollar;19,350 by the same age. \n\n  \" It 's as if they feel that by taking charge of money issues,\n\nthey' 'readmitting failure, that they won't meet someone or ever have help,\"\n\nLeonard says.\n Most single young women are betting they 'll get married, and they\n\nprobably will, but either way, making financial plans for the future today is\n\ncrucial.",

{"text": "I began asking by myself the question: \" What is the best group\n\nintervention to treat test anxiety in graduate students?\" I began my search\n\nby accessing the Social Work Library website.\n I conducted searches on a couple of different databases.\n The first database I searched on was ProQuest.\n I searched \" test taking anxiety\" and \" graduate students\" and \" group\n\ninterventions\" and received no results.\n I then simplified my search to just \" test anxiety\" and \" graduate\n\nstudents\" and found some results; however, most of them were studies on test\n\nanxiety and not on treatment.\n I then added \" treatment\" to my previous search and found two studies\n\non test anxiety and treatment.\n I decided to try and search ERIC.\n I entered \" test anxiety\" and \" graduate students\" and \" treatment\" in\n\nthe search categories and found two articles that included that criterion.\n I then searched the PsychInfo database using the terms \" graduate\n\nstudents\", \" test anxiety\", and \" treatment\".\n I found many articles about the treatment of test anxiety.\n I then tried to scale down my results by adding \" group treatment\"\n\nand found studies that specifically had tested a group treatment approach.\n I attempted to add \" evidence based practice\" to this search but\n\nfound no results.\n I only included articles from scholarly journals and attempted to\n\nlook for more recent studies.\n When I could not access a journal article through the Columbia\n\nUniversity Library I entered the title into Google Scholar to see if the text\n\nwas available on the internet.\n After conducting my literature search I came up with my COPES\n\nquestion which asks \" If second year social work graduate students who are\n\nexperiencing test anxiety about the LMSW licensing exam receive cognitive\n\nrestructuring or relaxation therapy or skills training in a group setting\n\nwill they show reduced levels of anxiety after intervention?\" I used this\n\nquestion to guide my reading of the studies found. \n\n  This study synthesized the results of 56 studies on text anxiety\n\ntreatments.\n The analysis looked at studies that used cognitive-behavioral, skill\n\nfocused, cognitive, meditation, and physical exercise based interventions.\n The most effective interventions were those that combined cognitive\n\nand skills training ( E=1.22).\n The next most effective treatment was found to be behavioral and\n\nskills training ( E=1.10).\n Behavioral interventions only were also found to be effective (\n\nE=.80).\n Other techniques like meditation and physical exercise produced a\n\nsmall effect size so were deemed less effective in reducing anxiety symptoms\n\n( E=0.15). \n\n  In terms of intervention techniques the analysis showed that\n\ncognitive restructuring has the largest effect size ( E=1.10).\n Other techniques that also produced large effect sizes were combined\n\nbehavioral and skills focused training, cognitive and skills focused\n\ntraining, other behavioral techniques, anxiety management training, CBT and\n\nskills focused training, and systematic desensitization.\n Behavior modification, study skills training, meditation, and\n\nphysical exercise techniques were all shown to have small effect sizes. \n\n  This study reports the efficacy of cognitive restructuring on\n\nreducing test anxiety symptoms.\n The study consisted of three groups with a total of thirty-six\n\nparticipants who are college or graduate schools.\n One group received a cognitive restructuring treatment, one group\n\nreceived an exposure treatment, and the last group received no treatment.\n Based comparing the scores of questionnaires given to the group in\n\nthe first and last session, the authors found that participants in the\n\ncognitive restructuring group experienced a greater reduction in anxiety\n\nsymptoms. \n\n  This study looks at the effectiveness of the combination of\n\ncognitive and relaxation therapy and study-skills training in reducing\n\nanxiety symptoms and improving test scores.\n Forty-five undergraduate test-anxious students participated in the\n\nstudy.\n The study consisted of four different groups.\n One group received relaxation and cognitive therapy, one group was\n\nreceived study-skills training, one group received a combination of cognitive\n\nand relaxation therapy and study-skills training and the last group received\n\nno treatment.\n The authors found that the combined therapy of cognitive/relaxation\n\ntherapy and study-skills training were significantly more effective than\n\neither treatment alone in reducing anxiety symptoms. \n\n  Many studies have found that a multimodal approach is more\n\neffective in reducing test taking anxiety.\n In Ergene ( 2003) results show that a combination of cognitive\n\ntherapy and skills training is most effective in reducing test taking\n\nanxiety.\n Goldfried et al. ( 1978) and Denado and Diener ( 1986) supported the\n\nfinding of the meta-analysis.\n The Ergene ( 2003) study has the highest level of scientific support\n\nfor effectiveness because it is a meta-analysis of 56 other studies.\n Bloom, Fischer, and Orme ( 2009) state that in order to provide our\n\nclient\u00d5s with evidence based practices it is important to focus on studies\n\nthat are able to synthesize many different studies to find the practices with\n\nthe largest effect size.\n The quasi-experimental studies I found on test taking anxiety have\n\nsmall sample sizes, varying research settings, and conflicting results.\n Ergene ( 2003) was able to test the results from these different\n\nstudies to answer the broad question of which interventions are most helpful\n\nin reducing anxiety symptoms in test anxious participants. \n\n  The combination of two different approaches will holistically\n\nreduce anxiety symptoms.\n For students who are feeling anxiety they may have negative thoughts\n\nabout their ability and their anxiety might also prevent them from being able\n\nto skillfully study for a test.\n The cognitive therapy approach will focus on the students\u00d5 worry and\n\nemotions around test taking, while the skills training will give students the\n\nskills they need to feel more prepared when taking the test, thereby,\n\nreducing anxiety.\n For example, a student may enter the group feeling worried and\n\noverwhelmed about the exam.\n The student\u00d5s anxiety might inhibit her ability to use her time in a\n\nproductive way.\n The combination of the two techniques will ease the student\u00d5s\n\nfeelings of worry and being overwhelmed, while at the same providing her with\n\npractical skills she can use to improve her studying. \n\n  Based on research on test anxiety treatments I have decided to\n\ncreate a group that combines cognitive restructuring and skills-focused\n\ntraining.\n This group will address the psychological reactions that the students\n\nhave around taking the licensing test as well as teach them skills to help\n\nwith recall, organized thinking, and time management.\n\n  For students who are interested in joining the group the\n\nintervention will be a combination of cognitive therapy and skills-focused\n\ntraining.\n These treatments are based on the theories that negative cognitions\n\nand learning deficits cause test taking anxiety ( Jones and Petruzzi, 1995).\n The cognitive therapy technique that will be used is cognitive\n\nrestructuring.\n In the first thirty minutes of each session the main facilitator will\n\nask for examples from the group of negative cognitions they have had about\n\ntaking the LMSW exam.\n Examples of these cognitions include statements like \" I am so stupid\n\nI don\u00d5t even know where to begin studying\" and \" People like me never pass\n\ntests.\" The group will work together to challenge any negative cognitions and\n\nrestructure them so that they are neutral or positive. \n\n  The skills training component will compliment cognitive\n\nrestructuring because often students with test anxiety feel that they need\n\nbetter skills to do well on an exam ( Poorman et al., 2009).\n The skills training component of the group will take place during the\n\nlast half an hour of each session.\n The skills training will include these topics: goal setting, time\n\nmanagement, improving study skills, and test-taking strategies. \n\n  At the beginning of each session, students will be asked to\n\ncomplete the Test Anxiety Inventory ( Spielberger, 1980) and take a 5\n\nquestion test based on material covered on the LMSW exam.\n Homework will be assigned to practice both techniques.\n Students will be asked to keep a weekly diary card where they will\n\nrecord negative thoughts they have about taking a test while outside the\n\ngroup.\n Student will be asked to do a variety of different assignments in\n\norder to practice the skills-focused training techniques they learn in group.\n These will include creating a study schedule and time management\n\nchart. \n\n  The first strength of these operationalized versions of the\n\noutcomes are that the main outcome, a decreased level of anxiety, will be\n\nmeasured using a standardized measure that has been proved valid and has a\n\nset of norms for different populations. \n\n  The second strength of these measures is that they can easily be\n\nanalyzed.\n\n\n  The greatest weakness of these operationalized outcome measures\n\nis that they require a lot of work from the participants.\n This is especially difficult when the problem the group is addressing\n\nis related to performance anxiety.\n The amount of work needed for each measurement might trigger greater\n\nanxiety in some participants. \n\n  The target of the group intervention is anxious feelings around\n\ntest taking.\n Jones and Petruzzi ( 1995) state that negative cognitions present in\n\ntest taking anxious individual impair good performance.\n Poorman et al. ( 2009) adds that individuals often experience\n\nbehaviors like difficulty paying attention, frequently getting off task, and\n\nincreased distractibility.\n The intervention will address the different facets of test anxiety.\n The cognitive restructuring component of the intervention will seek\n\nto reduce negative cognitions by examining the students\u00d5 cognitions and\n\nsystematically altering these thoughts to promote positive thoughts around\n\ntest taking abilities.\n The skills-focused training component will focus on the behaviors\n\nassociated with test taking anxiety.\n Skills like time management, creating a study log, and various\n\nstrategies for test taking will address learning deficits and negative\n\nbehaviors.\n After the intervention students in the group will be able to alter\n\ntheir own negative cognitions and use the skills learned to prepare for the\n\nLMSW test, which will lead to lower anxiety. \n\n  Group participation will be measured by the verbal participation\n\nof the group participants.\n The co-facilitator will record the frequency of each persons\u00d5 verbal\n\nparticipation during the group session.\n Verbal participation is defined in a broad way as meaning any time a\n\nparticipants speaks in the group.\n Participants will be expected to participate at least once a session.\n Without verbal participation one can assume that members are not\n\nreceiving the full benefits of being in the group. \n\n  The strength of this kind of measure is its ease of use.\n No special equipment is needed and it is easy to chart change in\n\nbehavior over time ( Bloom, Fischer, and Orme, 2009).\n The weakness of this type of measure is that some participants might\n\nbe uncomfortable speaking in front of the group.\n This is especially true since the participants are experiencing\n\nsymptoms of anxiety that might make them feel too vulnerable to share their\n\nfeelings. \n\n  Trends in the data will be examined in order to assess the\n\nsuccess of the intervention.\n Each outcome measure will be graphed for a visual analysis of the\n\ntrend.\n Since groups are made up of individuals whose scores vary there can\n\noften be outliers that might skew a mean or standard deviation of the data (\n\nBloom, Fischer, and Orme, 2009).\n To avoid this all data will be plotted using a box plot that takes\n\ninto account the median score of each outcome and range of the scores.\n The baseline will be collected from the measurements administered\n\nduring the first session before the intervention. \n\n  Research has shown that there are gender and cross-cultural\n\ndifferences in the rate of test taking anxiety.\n Everson et al. ( 1991) found that women experience more anxiety\n\naround test taking and academic achievement than men.\n Some researchers hypothesize that this is because woman are\n\nsocialized to express their emotions, while men are taught to suppress their\n\nfeelings ( Boda and Ollendick, 2005).\n Bodas and Ollendick ( 2005) also found that test anxiety differs\n\ncross-culturally.\n The authors feel that the variation in parenting styles accounts for\n\nmuch of this difference.\n In many non-Western cultures parents put excessive pressure on their\n\nchildren to do well academically.\n This pressure causes non-Western children to have more test anxiety\n\nbut also more shame about that anxiety.\n Overall, Bodas and Ollenick ( 2005) suggest that there is a lack of\n\ntheoretical background in test taking anxiety that is based on the\n\nunderstanding of the norms and beliefs of different cultures.   \u00ef\u00ff", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "cb244ed2-2fd0-469f-b40e-c4190179f3b5", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.859537+00:00"}
{"text": "<P>  IN AMERICA we are taught from our earliest years, that upward\n\nmobility is the essence of the American dream.\n Growing up in a white working-class family, I equated such mobility\n\nwith the \" good life,\" \" making it,\" and middle-class respectability.\n Like many of my peers, I saw education as the key to actualizing my\n\nvision.\n It was clear that I not only wanted to move up, but out.\n By getting a \" good education\" I would be able to leave my past behind\n\nand create a life for myself which was radically different from that of my\n\nparents. \n\n<P>  During those early years, my own classism prohibited me from\n\nquestioning the \" dream\" or the \" rewards\" education would bring.\n I was also unprepared for the marginality and estrangement I would\n\nfeel as my \" dream\" came true.\n These feelings initially surfaced during college and only intensified\n\nas I moved up the educational hierarchy.\n\n\n<P>  For many years I saw this pattern as indicative of my own\n\npersonal inadequacies rather than as a function of the ways in which my\n\ngender and class background shaped my experience within academe.\n In other words, I lacked what C. Wright Mills called the sociological\n\nimagination, or the ability to see that my private troubles were intricately\n\nlinked to larger social forces.\n A key barrier to developing this awareness was the invisibility of\n\nother faculty who shared my class background.\n Without the knowledge that there were others \" like me,\" it was\n\ndifficult to move beyond a self- or victim-blaming perspective.\n It was only by breaking my self-imposed silence and sharing my\n\nexperience with others that I began to realize I was not alone.\n By coming out of the closet I soon discovered that what I had viewed\n\nas personal problems were, in fact, common struggles. \n\n<P>  As I spoke with other women like myself, it became clear that\n\nthese struggles were directly related to the dual nature of our class\n\nidentity.\n On the one hand, we had, in many ways, become middle class.\n Our education, occupation, and income were indisputable markers that\n\nclearly separated us from our families of origin.\n Yet our subjective experience of class was not that clear cut.\n Despite our objective position in the class structure, many of us did\n\nnot feel middle class or as if we really belonged in the world we inhabited.\n What we were keenly aware of, which many of our middle-class\n\ncolleagues failed to understand, is that \" education and a good job don't\n\nturn a black person white and they don't negate a white working-class\n\nperson 's background\" ( McKenney 147).\n As a consequence, a part of our identity was middle class while\n\nanother part remained back in the working-class world of our roots. \n\n<P>  Thus, as upwardly mobile working-class women, we lived in two\n\nculturally distinct and, at times, contradictory worlds.\n One consequence of this multiple consciousness was that we often\n\nexperienced ourselves as outsiders, both within the middle-class world of\n\nacademia and within our families of origin.\n As members of what might be best described as a transition class, we\n\nsaw ourselves as living on the margins of two cultural worlds but as members\n\nof neither.1 \n\n<P>  We also felt that this sense of marginality was augmented further\n\nby our gender.\n As women, we were well aware of our anomalous position within an\n\ninstitution whose structure and ideology reinforced patriarchal values.\n As a consequence, we frequently saw ourselves as outside the\n\nmainstream of university life, alienated and invisible.2 \n\n<P>  In this chapter 1 examine the personal and professional struggles\n\nfaced by female academics from the working class as they try to cope with\n\ntheir marginal status and the psychic disequilibrium created by upward\n\nmobility.\n Given the dearth of literature on this topic, I will draw on my\n\nexperiences and those shared with me by other women faculty.\n Like myself, these women are white and all are in their mid-thirties\n\nto early forties.\n The ambiguities and ambivalences with which we are most familiar\n\nshape the central themes of this chapter.\n How these themes might differ for male academics from the working\n\nclass, or for other racial and age groups, are issues that remain to be\n\nexplored. \n\n<P>  Central to any discussion of social class is the profound effect\n\nit has on our perception of the world as well as of our place in it.\n When we identify ourselves as being in one class or another, we are\n\nmaking a statement about what we view as our objective position within the\n\nclass structure.\n However, class is more than an abstract category or benign label\n\nassigned to self or others.\n Each class has a distinctive social51 existence, a culture that\n\ncreates a sense of belonging among its members ( Ryan and Sackrey 107).\n This culture shapes how we speak, walk, dress, eat, our sense of\n\ncontrol over our life, our values and attitudes regarding work, family,\n\nintimacy, money, leisure, and education.3 \n\n<P>  Within American society, however, each class culture is not\n\nequally valued.\n Specifically, the norm, the standard of acceptability and\n\nrespectability, is middle class.\n Thus, to be from the working class is to be defined as \" less than,\"\n\ninferior, subordinate.\n As many feminists have noted, this pattern of responding not only to\n\nclass but to all human differences in dualistic and hierarchical terms\n\ncharacterizes much of Western thought.\n Representing what may be called a patriarchal consciousness, this\n\nmode of thinking \" conditions us to see human differences in simplistic\n\nopposition to each other: dominant/subordinate, good/bad, up/down,\n\nsuperior/inferior\" ( Lorde 114).\n Within this framework, those who lack privilege and power become \"\n\nother,\" the outsider whose experience is ignored, devalued, or erased.4 \n\n<P>  For members of the working class and other subordinate groups,\n\nthis reductive response to human differences often leads to internalized\n\noppression.\n This refers to the \" incorporation and acceptance by individuals\n\nwithin an oppressed group of the prejudices against them within the dominant\n\nsociety\" ( Pheterson 148).\n And, as Pheterson notes, internalized oppression is likely to be\n\nassociated with feelings of inferiority, self-hatred, self-concealment, and\n\nisolation ( 148). \n\n<P>  What are the consequences of these cultural patterns for\n\nacademics from the working class?\n First, they strongly affect how such faculty perceive themselves and\n\ntheir place within the academy.\n Given the middle-class values and assumptions that permeate\n\nuniversity life, academics from the working class are constantly aware of\n\ntheir differences from the norm.5 The taken-for-granted reality that \"\n\neveryone is middle class\" typically structures the curriculum as well as\n\nconversations with colleagues and administrators.\n Within this environment, it is not surprising that, as Ryan and\n\nSackrey learned, working-class faculty often view themselves as outsiders or\n\nas marginal members of the academy.\n For female academics from the working class, this sense of not\n\nbelonging is augmented further by the masculinist culture and male-centered\n\nnature of the university.6 Well aware of their outsider status, both as women\n\nand as members of a culturally devalued class, many silence themselves.\n While this strategy enables them to \" pass\" as middle.52 class or\n\nappear as an insider to others, \" passing\" is not the same as belonging.\n Thus, silence may protect working-class faculty from being \"\n\ndiscovered\" by others, but it does not eradicate their cultural heritage anti\n\nthe feelings of estrangement that stem from it. \n\n<P>  Second, due to internalized oppression, working-class faculty may\n\nbe more likely than their middle-class colleagues to have serious doubts\n\nabout their self-worth, skills, and ability to perform or succeed.\n Objective evidence of professional success often does little to\n\nameliorate these doubts and, in fact, frequently has the opposite effect.\n This theme is aptly illustrated by the following experience shared\n\nwith me by a well-known women s studies scholar Although she had published\n\nfive books, she experienced a great deal of difficulty completing and\n\nsubmitting the final draft of each one.\n In her words, she feared \" letting go\" of her work because she knew\n\nthis would ultimately lead to her being \" judged by others and put on trial.?\n Though her work was always well received, each time she neared the\n\ncompletion of a new book, she would begin to define her past successes as a\n\nfluke; she had just gotten \" lucky.?\n This time, however, it would be different.\n Her ultimate fear would become a reality.\n was: \" a\n\nworking-class kid who managed to con everyone into believing she was good\n\nenough, smart enough, and so forth.?\n Although she always managed to overcome this fear and submit her work\n\nfor publication, doubts regarding her self-worth remained.\n Accordingly, whenever a new challenge or project arose, the cycle\n\nwould repeat itself. \n\n<P>  The fear that others will discover one is a fraud or impostor is\n\nquite common among first-generation professionals, including academics from\n\nthe working class.7 Having internalized the classism of the larger culture,\n\nsuch faculty may find it difficult to accept praise from others and they\n\noften deny their own competence.\n Accordingly, they attribute success to external events such as luck\n\nrather than to personal skill or ability.\n Ironically, as their professional achievements increase,\n\nworking-class faculty may feel more than ever that others have a false\n\nimpression of them.\n And, this in turn, can heighten their fear of being \" discovered.\"\n\n\n\n<P>  Another issue that may arise concerns the symbolic meaning of\n\none 's work or professional success. For often what is defined as \" success\"\n\nwithin the middle-class world of academia becomes yet another manifestation\n\nof separateness and alienation from the working-class world of one 's roots.\n Accordingly, the more one succeeds, the greater53 the social distance\n\nfrom one 's class of origin.\n Given this dynamic, there is often a desire for and simultaneous fear\n\nof such \" success\" among working-class faculty.\n This double bind can lead to confusion and ambivalence regarding what\n\nothers in academe take for granted as indicators of professional success (\n\ne.g., completing a dissertation, publishing, receiving tenure).\n Working-class academics may therefore experience more difficulty\n\nreaching professional goals than their middle-class colleagues.\n And, once achieved, such success can raise new existential dilemmas.\n This theme, as well as the class-based contradictions associated with\n\nacademic success, has emerged repeatedly in my conversations with others.\n For example, during a recent conference, I heard a working-class\n\nfaculty member discuss her response to receiving tenure.\n For years she had thought this rite of passage would mark the\n\nbeginning of a new life.\n Self-doubt and anxiety would no longer characterize her experience\n\nwithin academe.\n After all, she would have \" made it\" and finally proven herself She\n\nsoon discovered, however, that tenure was a mixed blessing.\n It secured her place within the middle-class world of academe, but by\n\ndoing so, raised a plethora of new questions: Was she now one of \" them\"?\n Had she finally become a full-fledged member of the educated elite, a\n\ngroup her family referred to with disdain, yet often admired and wanted to\n\nemulate?\n Had she betrayed those she left behind?\n Would her newly won status separate her even more from her family of\n\norigin?\n this rite of passage mean in terms of her\n\nself-definition?\n As I listened to her remarks, I remembered having similar thoughts\n\nwhile writing my dissertation.\n In fact, these thoughts were a large part of why I feared completing\n\nit.\n Thus, for working-class academics, whether beginning or at later\n\nstages of their careers, professional success can create identity confusion\n\nas well as heighten feelings of estrangement. \n\n<P>  The feelings of marginality and alienation experienced by\n\nworking-class faculty within the academy may also permeate their\n\nrelationships with significant others from their past, particularly family\n\nmembers.\n As one interviewee in a recent study of working-class academics\n\nnoted: \" Years of living a university life have isolated me from my working\n\nclass origins.\n What do we have in common, what can we talk about?\n Their interests are not my interests, their values are no longer\n\nmine\" ( Ryan and Sackrey 138).\n Given the centrality of kin in working-class culture, such isolation\n\ncan create a great deal of anguish.8 In addition, 54 because women tend to\n\ndefine themselves in more relational terms than men, estrangement from kin\n\nmay be particularly difficult for female academics from the working class.9\n\nSuch women learn very early in their careers that their life-style, general\n\ninterests, and work are largely incomprehensible to their families.\n Although family members may try to understand this \" new\" life, the\n\npain is, in many ways, that they can't.\n Attempts to explain one 's life-style and work often only broaden the\n\nchasm and, in the end, it becomes painfully clear that they are living in\n\nradically different worlds from one another.\n For example, during a recent conversation with my mother, I began\n\ndiscussing a conference I planned to attend on the West Coast.\n She immediately asked what people did at a conference and I explained\n\nthat they present their ideas and talk about them with others.\n She then asked whether I knew any of the people who would be there\n\nand I said a few, but that hundreds would be attending.\n Her response: \" You mean to tell me that you are going to travel\n\nthree thousand miles to talk to people you don't even know?\"", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "24d05d61-3b5e-4cee-aff4-045e497a987c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.860934+00:00"}

Mice scurrying through the attic arouse more attention.\n\n  The pessimists shook their heads as head coach Phillip Fulmer\n\nhalted the mano a mano Tuesday morning.\n\n  He too was looking for the feverish, heart-thumping pitch of a\n\nTennessee team 's first day in pads.\n\n  \" We weren't where we wanted to be.\n We went through two or three shots there and it was obvious that the\n\nintensity wasn't there,\" Fulmer said.\n\n  \" We were dragging,\" fullback Will Bartholomew said.\n\n\n  Fulmer slapped, calling the team together to preach briefly about\n\ndemands, desires and necessities for success.\n\n  \" The Tennessee drill is something we take great pride in, and I\n\nwas pleased with the response when we started the drill over,\" he said.\n \" They're a young football team and it 's up 're us as a staff to lead\n\nthem and get them ready for different situations.\n\n The expected intensity flourished.\n\n\n  \" It was welcome to the jungle, like you're a piece of meat\n\nthrown into a 'refight,\" said Victor McClure, a freshman defensive end from\n\nSoddy-Daisy.\n \" It was rough on me.\n I got too high both times.\n But it was exciting.\n I love putting on the pads.\n\n\n  Winning the one-on-one battles will be a recurring theme\n\nthroughout the season, Bartholomew said.\n\n  \" The Tennessee drill is more of a team attitude drill,\" he said.\n \" It 's about being mentally tough, and I have no doubt this is going\n\nto be one of the hardest-hitting summers we've ever had.\n\n\n  It 's really what football - - and the Tennessee drill - - are all\n\nabout.\n\n  \" You can't play football in shorts,\" Fulmer said after Tuesday\n\nmorning 's practice.\n \" I look at this morning as the official opening of the season.\n You have to put on pads and see who 's willing.\n If they let you play two-hand tag all the time, it would be a\n\ncompletely different game.\" \n\n\n  The head coach left campus right after his meeting with the media\n\nto fly to Winchester, Tenn., where his mother ( Nan Lee Fulmer) was having\n\nemergency surgery.\n\n  He missed Tuesday afternoon 's practice, leaving assistant head\n\ncoach John Chavis in charge.\n\n\n  Will Ofenheusle 's move to right guard ( from tackle) is taking on\n\nthe look of permanency.\n \" I'm glad they moved me.\n I have the challenge of learning a new position and it gives you a\n\ncompletely different perspective on the game.\n It looks like I'm going to be there,\" he said.</ 'm\n\n\n  Sophomore Anthony Herrera was back with the first team, working\n\nat left guard in place of Champion ( Fred Weary was at center, Ofenheusle at\n\nright guard, Reggie Coleman at left tackle and Michael Munoz at right tackle. .. .\n Northwest Whitfield 's Sean Young is running second team at right\n\ntackle.\n\n  True freshman Rashad Baker worked exclusively at cornerback\n\nMonday and Tuesday, \" and he looks like he has a real chance to be a special\n\nplayer over there,\" said Fulmer.\n \" Well continue a couple of more days working him both ways and then\n\nmake a decision as to where he can best help this football team.\"\n In the next breath, however, Fulmer pretty much sealed Baker 's fate\n\nwhen he said, \" Mark Jones has made some really nice strides as a receiver\n\nand ( fellow freshman) Tony Brown has shown he can help this team.\n\n\n  On quarterbacks Joey Mathews, A.J. Suggs and Casey Clausen,\n\nFulmer isn't discouraged, but he 's having to stretch his patience.\n \" At times our quarterbacks are doing what we need to get done and at\n\ntimes they're just not as consistent 're they need,\" he said.\n \" Some of it is experience and some of it is their need for more\n\nintensity and concentration on each play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Chattanooga 's biggest health insurers are helping insure a\n\nhealthy job market for local workers. \n\n  Cigna Healthcare, which has boosted its Chattanooga staff by more\n\nthan 50 percent over the past two years, could add up to 300 more jobs in the\n\nnext 18 months as part of its ongoing expansion in Chattanooga.\n UnumProvident, the world 's biggest disability insurer, is already in\n\nthe midst of a similar staff addition.\n And BlueCross and BlueShield of Tennessee, the state 's largest health\n\ninsurer, recently added 60 employees at its Chattanooga headquarters to\n\nservice a new Medicare contract in New Jersey.\n\n  \" There 's a lot of opportunities right now for workers in this\n\nfield,\" said Sandra McFarland, vice president of operations at Olsten\n\nStaffing Services, which has helped recruit and hire hundreds of workers for\n\nUnumProvident.\n \" We have to do things a lot differently than we did five years ago\n\nto find enough qualified people.\n\n\n  But as the home of two of the largest insurance companies in the\n\nSouth - - and field offices for several others spun off from those two - -\n\nChattanooga has developed a pool of talent to staff such insurance\n\noperations.\n To help keep that base, city and county governments are also moving\n\nthis month to provide some tax relief for Cigna 's growing operations.\n\n  \" We have a well-qualified work force for this business in\n\nChattanooga,\" said Steve Hiatt, manager of business development for the\n\nChattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce.\n \" With all of the insurance business we have in Chattanooga already,\n\nI think Cigna realized the advantages of building its business here.\n\n\n  The Chattanooga Industrial Development Board is slated this month\n\nto approve a financing package to cut Cigna 's property taxes on equipment in\n\nhalf for the next five years.\n Since 1998, Cigna has invested more than\n\n&dollar;13 million in personal property improvements and\n\n&dollar;2 million in real property improvements at five different offices in\n\nChattanooga.\n\n\n  In the second phase of Cigna 's expansion now under way, the\n\ncompany is investing another\n\n&dollar;4 million to create another 400 to 600 more jobs, according to documents\n\nprepared for the city and county.\n\n  Currently, Cigna has about 2,000 of its own employees and another\n\n200 contract workers employed in different company divisions in\n\nChattanooga.\n\n  \" We expect that in the next 18 months, that number is going to\n\ngo to about 2,500 employees with the same or more numbers of temporary\n\nworkers,\" said John Sorrow, regional director for Cigna Healthcare 's East\n\nTennessee division.\n\n  David Feng, corporate relations spokesman for Cigna, said the\n\nexact number of additional employees hired in the future depends upon how the\n\nbusiness fares.\n\n  \" We do have additional office capacity for expansion in\n\nChattanooga and we will continue to grow as needed,\" he said.\n\n  Cigna 's cross-town rival, BlueCross and BlueShield of Tennessee,\n\nalso expanded its staff this summer.\n The Chattanooga-based health insurer recently added 60 employees to\n\nhelp handle an\n\n&dollar;11 million contract which began this month to process Medicare claims in New\n\nJersey.\n\n  \" It 's a tight labor market and that means you have to work\n\nharder to get the right employees,\" BlueCross Vice President Ron Harr\n\nsaid.\n\n  But BlueCross 's new computer system has helped the company handle\n\nthree consecutive years of record growth in commercial business without much\n\nmore staff.\n\n \n\n  The drive for efficiency also has led UnumProvident to\n\nconsolidate more of its staff and functions in Chattanooga.\n The company is in the process of adding about 300 more local\n\nemployees, although the overall corporation has cut staff since the merger\n\nlast year of Unum and Provident.\n\n  Cigna Healthcare 's presence in Chattanooga is a corporate\n\noffspring of Provident, which split off its group health insurance line to\n\nHealthSource nearly a decade ago.\n Cigna acquired Healthsource in 1997 and has gradually built its\n\nChattanooga operations since.\n\n  Another spinoff from Provident also is growing in Chattanooga.\n Merastar Insurance, now a division of Prudential Insurance Co., was\n\ncreated from the group automobile insurance line started by Provident.\n\n  When Prudential acquired Merastar last year, the company closed\n\nMerastar 's claims office in Chattanooga and merged those operations with\n\nother Prudential offices.\n But since the start of this year, Merastar employment has grown from\n\n121 to 159 employees.\n\n  \" We anticipate still more significant growth, possibly another\n\n50 or 60 this year.\n In the year 2001, we could possibly double what we are now,\" said\n\nThomas Murphy, human resources manager for Merastar.\n \" We are on our way and are going to be an integral part of the\n\nChattanooga insurance market.\" \n\n  Merastar picked up a major account this week and has exercised\n\nits options for additional office space at its headquarters in the Eastgate\n\nTown Center, Mr. Murphy said. \n\n\n\n\n  When Chattanooga police padlocked the popular Whole Note on M.L.\n\nKing Boulevard last week, they pointed to the high number of calls to police\n\nfrom the club/restaurant 's location as one reason for taking action.\n\n  Records show The Whole Note and other nightspots do not rank\n\namong the top locations police were called to in the past year.\n The most frequent calls for police came from the police department 's\n\nown headquarters, shopping malls and various locations along Interstates 75\n\nand 24.\n\n  For example, police responded to calls at Hamilton Place 1,183\n\ntimes from July 1, 1999, to June 30 of this year.\n During the same period, police responded to calls at their own\n\nservices center on Amnicola Highway 1,616 times.\n In contrast, police were called to The Whole Note 139 times during\n\nthat period.\n\n  But comparing call volume doesn't give law enforcement\n\nauthorities a true picture of crime, said Sgt. Bobby Simpson, the officer in\n\ncharge of the department 's new civil enforcement unit.\n He included the number of calls in information he provided the\n\ndistrict attorney 's office on the padlocking of The Whole Note because it 's\n\nthe first question often asked, he said.\n\n  Police said in the last three years there were 19 aggravated\n\nassaults and 30 simple assaults at The Whole Note.\n\n\n  While police were called much more often to Hamilton Place or\n\nother area malls, few of those calls were for violent crime.\n Exact calls for specific crimes weren't available, but police said\n\nthe vast majority of calls to shopping areas are for minor wrecks,\n\nshoplifting, theft from cars, or helping people who had locked their keys in\n\ntheir cars.\n\n  Robin Flores' car was broken into at Hamilton Place last\n\nweekend, and his wife 's car was stolen.\n\n  \" I'm kind 'mf skittish now about going there,'' said Mr. Flores,\n\nan attorney and former police officer.\n\n  \" I pay\n\n&dollar;25 a month to the Police Department to get all the reports about the mall,''\n\nMr. Silvis said.\n\n\n  Chattanooga 's highway system also logged a lot of police calls.\n Nine of the 20 top call locations were along Interstates 75 and 24\n\nand on state Highway 153.\n The vast majority of those calls were for traffic accidents, police\n\nsaid.\n\n  Apartment complexes also produced a lot of calls.\n Woodlawn Apartments at 2300 Wilson St.\n ranked 10th; Patten Towers on East 11th Street ranked 13th; Signal\n\nView apartments on Mountain Creek Road ranked 17th; and East Lake Courts on\n\nFourth Avenue ranked 18th.\n\n  Sgt. Brian Bergenback said several hundred people live at each\n\nof those complexes.\n A sampling of calls showed they run the gamut, from disorderly\n\nconduct to aggravated assault.\n\n  Sgt. Jim Massengale, the department 's crime analyst, said\n\nthere 's little to be learned by looking at the number of police responses to\n\na specific address.\n\n  \" At many of these addresses there 's a pay phone outside and\n\npolice simply respond to that location where someone has called from,'' he\n\nsaid.\n \" To get a real understanding of the problem, you would have to look\n\nat each report.''\n\n  Looking only at numbers of calls, the Police Services Center at\n\n3300 Amnicola Highway would appear to be the city 's top problem spot,\n\nauthorities said.\n That 's because people come into the facility to report traffic\n\naccidents or crimes from across the city, said Sgt. Massengale.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1e74e041-7122-4c47-bc69-b126d88ba6ea", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.862285+00:00"}
{"text": "The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court Monday to review whether\n\nblack defendants are discriminated against in crack cocaine cases spotlights\n\na legal issue that has simmered for a long time.\n It even boiled over briefly this month in a flareup of violence at\n\nfederal prisons, including the facility in Greenville, Ill.\n\n\n  In a legal analysis last year, U.S. District Judge Clyde S. Cahill\n\nmade a strong case for Congress to abolish an anti-drug law that imposes\n\nrelatively harsh sentences against crack cocaine users.\n His is the kind of reasoned advice Congress should have heeded in its\n\nrecent review of this law.\n\n  Judge Cahill isn't alone in raising questions about the law.\n For very good reasons, the U.S. Sentencing Commission recommended this\n\nyear that crack and powder cocaine be treated the same for the purposes of\n\nsentencing.\n Though the drug laws were aimed at kingpins and major traffickers,\n\nthose caught in the dragnet tend to be poor blacks and Latinos.\n They are prosecuted and jailed for possessing relatively small\n\namounts of crack.\n Nationwide, 96 percent of all crack-related prosecutions involve\n\nblacks or Latinos.\n\n  Anyone convicted of possessing even 5 grams of crack\n\nautomatically gets five years in prison.\n A person would have to possess 100 times more powder cocaine, usually\n\nabused by middle-class whites, to draw a similar sentence, even though the\n\nchemical makeup of both drugs is said to be the same Unavoidably, Judge\n\nCahill 's analysis raised the issue of racism.\n Between 1989 and 1992, he notes, only one of the 57 persons charged\n\nwith crack violations in all of the Eastern District of Missouri was\n\nwhite.\n\n  The presumption that blacks in the Eastern District are singled\n\nout for prosecution is present, he argues, because the U.S. attorney 's office\n\nhas yet to explain the principles it followed in deciding who would be\n\nprosecuted for crack offenses.\n\n  President Bill Clinton used part of an Oct. 16 race-relations\n\nspeech in Austin, Texas, to criticize the fact that black men were\n\ndisproportionately prosecuted for drug crimes in relation to their use of\n\ndrugs.\n On the same day, at the Million Man March in Washington, the Rev.\n\nJesse Jackson and Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan also appealed for\n\na reversal of this unfair criminal-justice policy.\n\n  The Congressional Black Caucus later called this issue the first\n\ntest following the president 's speech and the march of whether society was\n\nserious about rooting out racially tainted public practices.\n\n  A week after the march, Congress provided the answer by voting\n\noverwhelmingly to uphold stiffer sentences for those caught with small\n\namounts of crack.\n\n\n  After praising the principles behind the Million Man March, many\n\nin official Washington still seem to say prisons, not wider opportunities,\n\nare the answer to social problems afflicting black men.\n\n\n  Affirmative action programs were supposed to be among the first\n\nDemocratic-sponsored government policies that would be overturned by the\n\nso-called Republican revolution.\n\n  For very good reasons, Congress has refrained from wholesale\n\nelimination of these programs.\n The continued survival of most of them is due in part to intense\n\nlobbying by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.\n\n  Its efforts have helped to shift the debate away from bigoted and\n\nanti-black rhetoric toward a more rational discussion of how affirmative\n\naction works, why it 's needed and who has benefited the most.\n It 's no accident, for example, that the Leadership Conference has\n\nspread the word that women of all races, and white women in particular, have\n\nreaped most of the rewards of affirmative action in the workplace.\n\n  Still, the issue clearly is certain to be a big topic in next\n\nyear 's presidential campaign.\n GOP candidate Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas has all but made sure of that.\n Last spring, he promised to add an anti-affirmative action rider to\n\nall appropriations bills.\n Wisely, the Senate has spurned this backdoor effort to pass\n\nlegislation to suit the views of one misguided individual.\n\n  The unsubstantiated notion among whites is that affirmative\n\naction is giving minorities unfair advantage - as if the absence of such\n\nprograms hadn't given whites unfair advantage for decades.\n\n  At any rate, Congress eventually may draft new rules for\n\ndetermining who deserves special help.\n That seems to be the preference of the Clinton administration.\n Meanwhile, Sen. Christopher S. Bond of Missouri already is pushing\n\nthe same concept in connection with federal set-aside contracts.\n He wants to limit them to businesses in low-income census tracts, on\n\nthe assumption that the firms would hire people from the neighborhoods.\n\n  That premise is false for two reasons.\n First, federal contracts are no guarantee of job opportunities.\n If they were, Washington wouldn't need an Office of Federal Contract\n\nCompliance.\n\n  Second, just because a business is situated in a black\n\nneighborhood doesn't mean jobs automatically flow to the neighborhood\n\nresidents.\n Mr. Bond and others need only look at the employment behavior of\n\nbusinesses already operating in or near low-income communities.\n These range from Asian-controlled beauty supply outlets to foundries\n\nto service industries in industrial parks.\n Many of them tend to give only token employment opportunities to\n\ncommunity residents.\n\n  Nor should Mr. Bond and others forget that black Americans who\n\nlive outside of low-income communities also feel the sting of racial and\n\neconomic discrimination.\n That fact suggests that society cannot avoid taking race into account\n\nif it is serious about eradicating discriminatory policies.\n\n\n  You can bet something more than good government is behind the\n\nattacks by Republicans and conservative Democrats on foundations affiliated\n\nwith various caucuses in Congress.\n One target is a\n\n&dollar; 100,000 donation that Nigeria 's military dictatorship gave to the\n\nCongressional Black Caucus Foundation.\n\n  Critics say this is an example of why foundations should be\n\nrequired to make full disclosures of their donations and explain how\n\nfoundation money is spent to support Congress' 29 caucuses.\n The\n\n&dollar; 100,000 check, the critics argue, is an example of loose controls over\n\nmoney and influence between caucuses and independent foundations.\n\n  In addition, some critics seek a law to forbid members of\n\nCongress from serving on the boards of foundations of caucuses with which\n\nmembers are affiliated.\n Rep. Alan Wheat of Kansas City happened to be the chairman of the\n\nBlack Caucus Foundation 's board at the time of Nigeria 's donation.\n He sees no conflict between his work in Congress and service to the\n\nfoundation, which, he says, has a\n\n&dollar; 2 million annual budget and distributes more than\n\n&dollar; 300,000 in scholarships each year and provides\n\n&dollar; 200,000 annually for internships and fellowships.\n\n  There was nothing illegal about Nigeria 's donation.\n Moreover the amount of money involved pales in relation to the sums\n\nthat lobbyists give to influence votes in Congress.\n The caucus' executive director, Quentin Lawson, points out that it\n\ngets larger donations from corporations that have specific legislative\n\ninterests, such as giant tobacco firms.\n Yet, conservatives do not get upset about these donations.\n Nor are questions raised about donations from multinational\n\ncorporations that give money in part to influence the way Congress treats\n\nforeign countries in which the multinationals do business.\n\n  Perhaps these caucuses should open their books to show that they\n\nhave nothing to hide - assuming they have nothing to hide.\n But the public also should know there 's a lot more than questions of\n\nclean government behind these attacks.\n They are an attempt to undermine a major means through which many\n\nliberal caucuses have gained clout.\n\n\n  Why are U.S. soldiers being sent to Colombia?\n To help build a road, school and hospital.\n That 's the official answer.\n\n\n  One issue is whether the soldiers are laying the groundwork for\n\nan assault on the Cali drug cartel.\n It is the world 's largest, now that Colombian government forces have\n\nkilled Pablo Escobar and crushed his Medellin cartel.\n The Cali headquarters happens to be about 45 miles northwest of the\n\nregion where U.S. soldiers will be assigned.\n That the U.S. soldiers will engage in a road-building project is\n\nhardly reassuring.\n Former President Ronald Reagan often sent units of the National Guard\n\non similar \" humanitarian\" projects.\n The roads, in some cases, were being built to accommodate military\n\nvehicles.\n\n  This mission could well be part of now-discredited U.S.\n\ndrug-interdiction efforts in Latin America.\n If so, it means the Clinton administration hasn't much of a fresh\n\nanti-drug policy.\n Drug cartels will remain plentiful as long as there is a demand for\n\nwhat they produce.\n In 1991, this nation spent\n\n&dollar;23 billion on interdiction and law enforcement programs.\n These supply-side initiatives were undertaken at the expense of\n\nmuch-needed treatment facilities and education programs.\n\n  Meanwhile, more and more people, out of frustration, are arguing\n\nthat decriminalization might be the answer.\n U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders got into hot water recently when\n\nshe sensibly suggested that the issue deserved study.\n Moreover, many Latin celebrities, including Colombia 's own Nobel\n\nliterature laureate, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, are calling for the legalization\n\nof drugs.\n Pointing to the crime and violent deaths that have been linked to the\n\nillicit-drug traffic, these artists say other solutions should be tried.\n\n  Mr. Clinton was quick to divorce himself from Dr. Elders'\n\nremarks.\n Just as quickly, he should divorce his administration from failed\n\ndrug policies.\n If interdiction is the covert reason for the U.S. mission in\n\nColombia, then it should be halted.\n The dangers of sending U.S. soldiers on loosely defined missions on\n\nforeign soil should be obvious.\n The time for Congress to ask some questions is now.\n Or, as usual, will it wait until a soldier returns home in a body\n\nbag\n\n\n  The Atlantic Coast was once one of the great repositories of fish\n\nin the world - home to enormous numbers of sea weakfish, sea bass, flounder,\n\nblues, spot, croakers, shad and herring.\n No more.\n As a result of massive overfishing, catches of nearly every species\n\nare down 70 percent or more in the last decade.\n Catches have fallen also along the Gulf and Pacific coasts and\n\nAlaska.\n Congress has acted before to correct the problem, but its solution\n\nhasn't really succeeded.\n\n\n  Just before Thanksgiving, Congress permitted a compact of states\n\non the Atlantic Coast to set tough catch limits and short fishing seasons.\n In 1976, Congress did the same thing under the Magnuson Fishery\n\nConservation and Management Act for deep sea fishing.\n But fishing close to shore went unregulated, and fish stocks there\n\nare now the ones most threatened.\n Congress has now empowered coastal states to focus on fishing close\n\nto shore.\n\n\n  Because past efforts at uniform enforcement of fishing and\n\nseason limits have been defeated by lax enforcement by some states, Congress\n\nwill now permit Washington to enter the picture and enforce limits on states\n\nreluctant to go along with the majority.\n The government is even empowered to declare a moratorium on\n\nthreatened species in uncooperative states.\n\n  Fish experts say that the mandatory provision is essential and\n\nthat it has worked before.\n In the early 1980s, it was used to compel cooperation in restricting\n\nfishing of striped bass in Chesapeake Bay.\n The species had nearly disappeared; now its population has\n\nsubstantially regenerated itself.\n\n\n  Naturally, there is a price; the huge, efficient trawlers\n\nresponsible for overfishing will make a lot less money.\n Some in the industry will even be forced out of business.\n That is an unhappy but necessary price to pay to stop the worst harm\n\nof all to the environment: reckless overuse.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "05d3ec3c-294c-45d0-b3f4-d29c0cddfe17", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.863755+00:00"}

how has Harambee been doing this?\n, a present staff member at Harambee, wrote a\n\ngood capsule summary: \" Our goal is to live among the people, feel their\n\nneeds and make their needs our needs, work with the community to meet the\n\nbasic needs of dignity and hope, and then make young people the leaders of\n\ntheir own community.\"\n Essentially, the staff at Harambee are trying to change the community\n\nby bringing the message of Christ into it.\n By this I mean that the primary problem of the people living in these\n\ncommunities is that society tells them in too many ways to catalog that they\n\nare worthless and have no chance of amounting to anything.\n Contrary to society, the message of Christ is that all persons are\n\nprecious in God 's sight.\n The staff thus seeks to first and foremost communicate to the people\n\nof the community that they are people with worth, by showing them in both\n\nintangible and practical ways that we care about them.\n ( Yes, it 's weird to write \" we\" when speaking of the Harambee\n\nstaff--but exciting as well!) \n\n  The foremost practical way of showing that we care about the\n\npeople of the community is in the youth program, which provides everything\n\nfrom a summer day camp for the kids in the area to tutoring and help with\n\nhomework during the school year, weekend hikes in the mountains, and\n\nbreakfast before church on Sunday mornings.\n Most of these kids have parents who show little if any concern for\n\nthem, who do not encourage them to have high hopes for what they can do with\n\ntheir lives, and who certainly do not challenge them in their education.\n Harambee tries to provide these needs for the kids, primarily through\n\none-to- one relationships between the staff and the kids.\n I will be spending about half of my time working in this youth\n\nprogram, tutoring, teaching arts and crafts, leading music, taking the\n\nchildren hiking and camping, teaching a sort of weekday Sunday school, and so\n\non.\n We hope that as we spend time with these kids, showing love for them\n\nand holding out challenges to them, they will gain the self-esteem and dreams\n\nneeded for them to escape the traps of despair and addiction that society\n\noffers them.\n We also hope that they will be inspired to take responsibility to\n\nhelp their community continue to overcome its problems and, as they grow up,\n\nchoose to stay in the community and use their capabilities and skills to help\n\nit further change into a place of hope and life.\n\n  I will also serve as a general assistant to the director of\n\nHarambee,  Allen Pickles.\n is not a very\n\norganized person and hopefully I can help get the program running more\n\nsmoothly) and some writing for their publications ( the founder,  Jasper\n\nParker, was self-educated after third grade, and so when he writes, he\n\nneeds a lot of editorial help to communicate his very powerful ideas).\n In addition, Harambee has programs in adult education, job training,\n\nand job placement, and  Allen is also thinking of trying to start a\n\ncoffeehouse to provide alternatives for entertainment in the area, so\n\ndepending on what evolves over next year, I could be involved with any or all\n\nof those projects, planning or administering them or even working to\n\nimplement them.\n\n  I hope this has given you some idea of what I'll be doi 'llnext\n\nyear.\n I am excited about being a part of Harambee; I think I will learn a\n\ngreat deal about practical ways American Christians are working to help\n\ntroubled communities overcome their problems.\n I expect that God will stretch me in a lot of ways as I try to fit\n\ninto a lower-class, predominantly black and Hispanic community as a servant,\n\nand I expect that I will learn a lot about life that I don't see as a white,\n\nwell- educated, upper-middle-class person.\n ( I am going to be raising my financial support and am aiming at\n\n&dollar;300/month,\n\n&dollar;250 of which will go to housing and food costs, so I will be having a new\n\neconomic experience.)\n During the year I will also be thinking about whether I want to go on\n\nto, graduate school in biophysics in 1991.\n I've applied t 've year and am planning to defer admission to\n\nsomewhere, probably but not definitely Harvard ( I have a little more\n\nthinking to do before I settle on them).\n However, I am not at all sure that I won't decide to continue in\n\nChristian social service work, perhaps at Harambee, perhaps elsewhere, or go\n\non staff with Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship for a few years, or go to\n\nseminary with an eye towards eventually teaching religious studies in a\n\nseminary or a university. \n\n  If you have further questions about what it is I'm up to, if\n\n'momething in this letter is unclear or if you simply want to know more, let\n\nme know!\n I'm trying to ke 'm this letter under two pages, and I figure not\n\neveryone will want to know all the imaginable details about Harambee--but I'm\n\nalways ha 'my to tell more.\n ( You may have to wait until spring break to hear, though, depending\n\non how my thesis goes.) \n\n\n\n\n  Well, what can I say about my first five days here.\n There 's been a mixture of exasperation and joy that I didn't really\n\nanticipate, but I'm not sure wh 'mI didn't expect it.\n To begin with, the joys.\n, is wonderful.\n She is black, from the West Side of L.A., and would have grown up in\n\nan environment just like the kids here in NW Pasadena had it not been for an\n\naunt who took her in as a little kid.\n As it stands, she is about to be a senior at Tarkio College in\n\nMissouri, a double major in religious studies and sociology.\n What 's neat is that she 's considering grad school, and is also very\n\ninterested in working in Christian community development.\n She also loves to sing, and she and I have been going walking in the\n\nmornings ( 6:15 a.m., bright &early! ) .\n So, we're get 'reg along really well.\n I don't want to take the time to go into all the other folks who are\n\nhere who are just super, but I'm expectin 'mto end the summer with close\n\nfriends. \n\n  Another thing that has been really fun has been planning for the\n\nfirst week with the kids here.\n I think that the summer program is really well set up.\n It 's not S.R.A. Summer Club ( for those of you that don't know,\n\nthat 's the ultra-organized day camp I worked for for four years ( how d'you\n\nlike that alliteration?) in Sw'more), b 'mause the kids are really different\n\nand their needs are equally different--poor black kids instead of rich white\n\nsuburban kids--but it 's going to be great.\n Planning the science lessons has been so much fun.\n I'm co-te 'mhing second grade with a woman from Kenya who has been at\n\nHarambee for about three months ( she 's five or six years older than I am) .\n, is going to be a fantastic sister in\n\nChrist and a great partner.\n Her faith is astounding to me.\n Some day she plans to go back to Kenya to do something on the lines\n\nof Harambee in the ( many) poor areas there, but for now she is following the\n\ncall of God in America.\n Anyway, next week we're 'reing rocks & minerals, which I was nuts\n\nabout when I was a kid, and it 's so much fun to go back to all the things I\n\nlearned when I was in elementary school--the Moh hardness scale, fossils, &c.\n and I\n\nare going to illustrate the layered structure of the earth with a model made\n\nout of ice cream ( to be eaten later by the kids, of course), among many\n\nother things. \n\n \n\nwho is temporarily working at World Christian Magazine and attending Fuller\n\nSeminary.\n He invited me over for dinner and we ended up talking until about\n\n9:00 p.m.--I really enjoyed his company.\n We talked about all kinds of things.\n It was a welcome moment of intellectual dialogue ( not to put down\n\nHarambee-- the people there are really smart, but the conversations centered\n\n95% of the time around the work to be done!).\n Finally, there have been a lot of wonderful moments of discussion\n\nabout Christ and Christianity, of prayer, and of worship.\n I won't describe them all right now, because it would take up a lot\n\nof space and time, but this is a place of good fellowship.\n\n  The most powerful things of the week include a conversation I had\n\nwith  Jared Byrd ( one of the other interns) and  Sing Chuen (\n\none of the full-time staff who is leaving after this summer) last night about\n\nthe role of spiritual warfare and the importance of prayer in trying to\n\nbattle drugs, the primary enemy here in NW Pasadena.\n It made me really think hard about how seriously I take prayer.\n As Sharon said, working here gives you better reason to pray than\n\nyou'v 'vever had before--people 's lives are at stake, and you often feel\n\nawfully helpless--and yet at the same time often the time to pray is sorely\n\nlacking because there 's so much to do.\n Please pray for me that I could keep the covenant I 've made with God\n\nto be faithful in prayer this summer ahead of everything else. \n\n  The other food for thought and prayer highlight was the\n\ndevotional teaching given to us by Dr.  Pickles</2> this-morning on I John\n\n3:11-24.\n He talked to us about Christian community, and he essentially said\n\nthat the most important part of the summer was our experience living together\n\nin community.\n For those of you who don't know, the nine interns, plus the two\n\nsingle full-time staff (  Sujin and  Walter), are all living\n\ntogether in one house and are eating our meals together; the Parson family\n\nare spread out over two other houses in the same complex which is centered\n\naround the \" ministry house\" ( building where the meetings, day camp, &c. are\n\nheld) .", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "445bfba7-c8cd-4dc0-bee6-d064dd0b8fde", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.865056+00:00"}
{"text": "Beginner Fishing - -\n\n\n\n  New to fishing?\n Trying to learn how to fish?\n Here are links to lots of information on beginner fishing.\n\n\n \n\n\n  Okay, so you decided you want to learn to fish.\n And you need to know who, what, where, when, and why on just about\n\nevery aspect of fishing.\n There are a number of ways to learn, not the easiest of which is\n\ntrial and error, although that method has a more lasting effect on your\n\nknowledge base. \n\n  If you are looking at saltwater fishing, there are some ways to\n\nease your way into the sport, and painlessly learn the ropes.\n If I were advising someone who was just beginning, here is where I\n\nwould point him or her: \n\n  We are assuming that you have opted out of paying for one-on-one\n\nlessons and that you have not hooked up with a friend willing to give of his\n\ntime to teach you one-on-one.\n Given these criteria, we will proceed.\n\n\n  Go out and buy a package of seasick medicine.\n Nothing can ruin your day more than seasickness.\n You would be amazed at how easy a novice on the water can become ill.\n My recommendation is Bonine.\n It has worked in every case for the people I take fishing.\n If it 's going to be a particularly rough day with heavy seas\n\noffshore, I have been know to take some myself.\n\n\n  Buy a reference book for beginners.\n Fishing for Dummies is a good start and is available on all the\n\nonline bookstores.\n It gives you simple instructions, terms, definitions, and generally\n\npoints you in the right direction.\n Read the book!\n There may be things you don't understand, but read the book anyway!\n Learn to tie several of the knots they will show you.\n Contrary to popular belief, a double granny knot will not work with\n\nfishing line.\n\n\n  Spend the money to go on a party/head boat.\n These are boats that carry from twenty to as many as seventy anglers.\n They provide everything - - bait, rod and reel, hooks, sinkers.\n They even help you fish and take the fish off your line for you.\n They will spot you if you are new and one of the mates will stay\n\nclose to you to help.\n They will do this partly out of customer service, but also wanting to\n\nkeep an eye on their rod and reel that they fear may accidentally go\n\noverboard.\n Remember the seasick medicine.\n This is where you will use it.\n Take a pill before you go to bed the night before and one when you\n\nwake up.\n Then take one as you board the boat.\n Trust me, you will thank me for this reminder.\n Head boats run from\n\n&dollar;30 to\n\n&dollar;60 a day, and you get to keep your fish! \n\n  Compared to the cost of a boat, fishing equipment, gas, and bait,\n\nit is a bargain for the beginner.\n You walk on empty handed and walk off with fish.\n\n\n\n  Assuming you have acquired the ability to operate a rod and reel\n\nfrom step three, you need to find a fishing pier.\n Most coastal cities have at least one public or pay-to-fish pier that\n\ngoes out into the ocean.\n Some even have a pier that goes into a bay or river.\n These piers will often rent tackle.\n They do sell bait and terminal tackle ( that 's the hooks and sinkers\n\nand the like) and will help you rig the rod and reel if you did not learn\n\neither from step two or three above.\n From that point you may feel like you are on your own.\n But fear not; help abounds.\n If you ask nicely and appear to be struggling on the pier, there are\n\nany number of pier anglers that will jump in to help you and give you advice.\n They are a special breed of angler and some of the friendliest folks\n\naround.\n\n\n\n  At this point I would repeat steps three and four several times\n\nto make sure you are getting the hang of things.\n Up to this point you have probably been fishing with what we call a\n\nconventional reel and a boat rod.\n Conventional reels are the ones that wind the line on the spool of\n\nthe reel similar to a winch.\n These are designed for heavy use and abuse.\n That 's why the head boats use them.\n You may want to consider other sizes and types of reels and rods at\n\nthis point. \n\n  Hopefully you have made a contact or two or even made friends\n\nwith an angler or two who can help with the decision to try another reel.\n Don't be afraid to ask a tackle shop owner for advice.\n\n\n\n  The key to becoming a successful angler is bound by two parts.\n The first is knowing the mechanics of the equipment and bait.\n Believe it or not, this is the easiest part.\n You can become very proficient at casting, knot tying, baiting, even\n\nwithout actually going fishing.\n The second part is the hardest and knowing this part can make your\n\nday.\n The second part?\n Simply knowing where to fish.\n I use the term simply with tongue in cheek.\n There are tens of thousands of anglers out there who have the\n\nmechanics down pat.\n They can cast, retrieve, bait a hook, and tie knots with the best of\n\nthem.\n Only a small percentage of these anglers can be considered\n\nsuccessful. \n\n\n  In almost any organization it can be said with relative assurance\n\nthat 20% of the people are responsible for 80% of the results of that\n\norganization.\n Those same percentages hold true in fishing.\n 20% of the anglers catch 80% of the fish.\n\n\n\n  The successful angler, beginner and pro, know where the fish are\n\nlocated at any particular time.\n Most fish move from place to place and back again with the tide and\n\ncurrent.\n Knowledgeable anglers learn these movements and are able to regularly\n\ncatch substantial numbers of fish.\n\n\n  When you understand that the one of the differences between a\n\nweekend angler and a guide who is catching fish is that the guide knows where\n\nthe fish are located, you begin to take heart.\n Now I know I will hear some heat from the guides out there, but\n\nhonestly, folks, if you are on the water every day and can keep track of the\n\nfish, you can catch fish when others can't.\n It 's a simple fact.\n\n\n  If you are planning to learn how to fish, maybe what we discussed\n\nhere can help get you started Of course, I can help answer some questions for\n\nyou as well along the way. \n\n  So I ask all you dads and moms, what better or healthier outdoor\n\nactivity could you involve your kids in than fishing? \n\n  You help your overall catch rate by being prepared and knowing\n\nwhere to fish...\n\n  Do you fish the same areas over, and over again?\n Those same flats; that same channel cutting through the grass; the\n\nsame ledge or wreck; you know all of the places you fish sometimes like the\n\nback of your hand.\n\n\n  You got to know those places over time by being familiar with\n\nthem So how can you go to a completely new area and have a chance at catching\n\nfish the first time out?\n\n\n  First of all, buy a good chart of the area If its an inshore\n\nlocation, you will need it for navigation.\n If you are going offshore, wreck locations, bottom contours, and GPS\n\nnumbers are on lots of fishing maps. \n\n  Stop at a good tackle shop and ask a lot of questions.\n Don't expect a lot of good answers in the early morning when they\n\nare busy.\n Come a little later in the morning when bait buying the rush has\n\nslowed, and simply tell the owner you are new to the area and that you would\n\nlike his or her help in locating some fish.\n They will be eager to help you, because if you are successful, it is\n\nlikely they just found a new customer!\n They will mark a chart up for you if you buy it from them, and that\n\nchart can end up being the best investment you can make. \n\n  When you get your chart, sit down one evening and study it.\n Find the cuts and channels.\n Locate the deeper holes or humps.\n Find the flats that will empty to a nearby channel at low tide.\n Chart study of this nature is basically eliminating large expanses\n\nof water rather than finding specific holes or places to fish.\n In any given area, there are literally miles of water that are not\n\nworth your while fishing.\n By simply eliminating that water, you can concentrate on more\n\nproductive water. \n\n  Find out what the tides will be on the day you plan to fish.\n When you talk to the local tackle shop be sure to ask which tides to\n\nfish. \n\n  If all else fails and you have the funds available, hire a\n\nguide.\n One day of fishing with a guide can teach you the areas to fish, the\n\nbait to use, and the tides to fish.\n Granted, the guide may take you to only one location, but you will\n\nat least have that location on which to count.\n Lots of you guides may get angry at me for suggesting this, but\n\nlet 's face it, it 's a paid trip and you'l 'llnly be giving up one location,\n\nnot your entire black book! \n\n  Go to any tackle shop and look at their selection of hooks.\n In a good shop, that selection can be mind boggling to the novice\n\nangler.\n Online tackle shops can be even more daunting to anglers, because\n\nthere is no one to answer questions about certain styles of hooks and their\n\nuse.\n\n\n  Knowing the sizing and naming conventions of the major\n\ncategories of hooks can help make your selection an easier task.\n Yes, Virginia, the type of hook you select does make a difference,\n\nand hook selection depends on the species of fish being sought. \n\n  There are five basic parts to a hook: the point, gap.\n shank, eye, and barb. Each of these parts can and will be different\n\non the various types of hooks in use today.\n Shanks can be long or short; eyes can be round, needle, or welded;\n\nand the gap width can vary significantly.\n All of these parts work together in each hook design, and different\n\nhook designs are made for different fishing applications. \n\n  There is no clear history on how the current hook sizing came\n\ninto existence.\n The measurements used today use a twofold numbering scheme that\n\nmeasures from the smallest hook to the largest hook. \n\n  The smallest hook readily available is size 24.\n This is a hook with a 1/16 of an inch gap and it 's used for tiny\n\ntrout flies.\n As the size number decreases, the width of the hook gap increases,\n\nall the way to a size 1.\n\n\n  At this point the numbering scheme changes and begins with 1/0 (\n\n\" one aught\"), which is larger in size than a number 1 and goes all the way\n\nup to 20/0, the largest commercially made hook. \n\n  Even with this \" recognized\" sizing method, sizes can vary from\n\nmanufacturer and sometimes even within a manufacturer.\n\n\n  Hooks are all made from metal.\n The type and size of the hook is a determinant for which metal.\n Saltwater hooks are generally made from a corrosion and rust\n\nresistant metal.\n Stainless steel is often used on the very large hooks.\n Freshwater hooks can be made from wire, as most of the smaller hooks\n\nare, or a cheaper less corrosion resistant metal. \n\n  Do not be totally guided by freshwater or saltwater labels on\n\nhooks.\n Many freshwater hooks are used in saltwater, and they work well if\n\ncared for properly.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3352a443-5bea-4246-b8e5-6a1fb8f7c0a9", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.866147+00:00"}
{"text": "\" Nothing without Divine Will,\" Motto of the State of Colorado\n\n\n\n \" It/She Flourishes under the Might of God,\" Motto of Princeton\n\nUniversity\n\n  The notion of the sacred or the numinous as a category for\n\nunderstanding religion was substantially launched by Rudolf Otto ( 1869-1937)\n\nin his classic Idea of the Holy ( Das Heilige) in 1917. Otto, indeed, coined\n\nthe term \" numinous,\" which has now become part of common usage. Otto 's\n\ninfluence on thought about religion extends from C.G. Jung ( 1875-1961) to\n\nthe \" Chicago School\" of history of religion founded by Mircea Eliade (\n\n1907-1986). On the other hand, Otto 's influence on the philosophy of religion\n\nhas been less strong, perhaps because he was professionally more of a\n\ntheologian ( not rigorous enough for philosophers) and is too easily\n\nmisunderstood and dismissed as describing some kind of mysticism. Even in the\n\nhistory of religion, Otto 's own analysis often does not persuade because of\n\nhis clear preferences for Christianity and his devaluation of religions that\n\ndo not measure up to Christian paradigms. \n\n  The history of Rudolf Otto 's theory of the sacred begins, however,\n\nmore than a century earlier, with the great philosopher Immanuel Kant (\n\n1724-1804).\n Otto 's own confidence in his ability to talk about God has its origin\n\nin Kant 's own theory about the basis of the concept of God in human reason.\n In the Critique of Pure Reason ( 1781) Kant had reworked the\n\ntraditional distinction between the immanent ( within the world) and the\n\ntranscendent ( outside the world) by distinguishing between phenomena and\n\nthings-in-themselves.\n \" Phenomena\" are how it is that objects appear in our own conscious\n\nminds.\n We do not have access to the world outside of the experiences we\n\nenjoy through our own consciousness, and Kant believed that consciousness\n\nitself, or the possibility of conscious experience, imposes certain\n\nconditions on the manner in which phenomenal objects appear to us.\n Among those conditions are the forms of space and time and the\n\nabstract forms of connections between events and objects such as the concept\n\nof substance and the relation between cause and effect.\n David Hume ( 1711-1776) had challenged philosophers to show why it is\n\nthat we believe in principles such as the one that every event must have a\n\ncause.\n Kant 's answer, then, was that the mind itself constructs a phenomenal\n\nreality according to just such a rule. \n\n  Things-in-themselves, in turn, are the way that reality exists\n\napart from our experience, our consciousness, our minds, and all the\n\nconditions that our minds might impose on phenomenal objects.\n The question occurs, then, whether concepts like substance and cause\n\nand effect apply to things-in-themselves the same way that they do to\n\nphenomena.\n Kant did not think that we could know.\n However, he did notice something very curious: it isn't just that we\n\napply the principle of cause and effect to phenomena, it is that we apply in\n\na certain way.\n In phenomenal reality, cause and effect are applied in a continuous\n\nseries.\n Every effect has a cause, but every cause also has a cause, and so\n\nforth, ad infinitum.\n This adds up to a philosophical principle of determinism, that\n\neverything is causally determined to act in a certain way.\n Kant believed that science sees things that way, but we do not, for\n\nthe idea of free will contradicts determinism.\n Free will involves a free cause, i.e. a cause that is not determined\n\nby some prior cause.\n We can also call that an unconditioned cause, since it is free of a\n\nprior causal condition, and it occurred to Kant that a characteristic of\n\nphenomenal reality was that everything was conditioned by something else.\n In that, Kant hit upon the same point that had been made earlier in\n\nBuddhist philosophy: in the reality that we see, everything is conditioned by\n\neverything else.\n One example of this in Buddhist thought is the doctrine of Relative\n\nExistence or No Self Nature: Nothing has a essence, nature, or character by\n\nitself.\n Things in isolation are sh\u00fbnya, \" empty.?\n The nature of things only exists in relation to everything else that\n\nexists.\n Existence as we know it is thus completely relative and conditioned\n\nby everything else.\n Only Nirv\u00e2na would be unconditioned, although we cannot know what it\n\nis like. \n\n  If an unconditioned cause cannot occur in phenomenal reality,\n\nthen it could only occur among things-in- themselves.\n But for all we know, even if cause and effect do apply among\n\nthings-in-themselves, determinism may even be true there also.\n Other kinds of unconditioned objects, like God or the soul - - God is\n\nnot conditioned by anything, and the soul is free of most of the conditions\n\nof phenomenal reality, like corruptibility - - might also exist among\n\nthings-in-themselves, but we cannot be sure about that either.\n Thus, Kant did not believe that it was possible to prove things about\n\nthings-in-themselves.\n If we try to do so, we create what Kant called \" dialectical\n\nillusion,\" involving contradictions in reason itself, e.g. between\n\ndeterminism and free will, which Kant called Antinomies.\n Kant 's Fourth Antinomy lays out equally compelling arguments for and\n\nagainst the idea of a Necessary Being, i.e. a God.\n Nevertheless, Kant believed that the existence of things like God,\n\nfreedom, and the soul could not be disproved; and in the Critique of\n\nPractical Reason ( 1788), he decides that the Moral Law provides us a basis\n\nfor making certain decisions about transcendent objects that mere theoretical\n\nreason could not do.\n Thus, we believe in free will because we must if we are to use moral\n\nconcepts like responsibility, guilt, praise, blame, retribution, punishment,\n\netc.; for according to determinism, no one is actually responsible for their\n\nactions, and scientific explanations will always reduce people to creatures\n\nof remote causes, e.g. genetics, childhood, society, drugs, disease, etc.\n All three of what Kant called the \" Ideas\" of pure reason in the\n\nFirst Critique--God, freedom, and immortality--Kant comes to believe are\n\nmotivated as objects of rational belief, on the basis of moral\n\nconsiderations, in the Second Critique. \n\n  The next step towards Otto comes with an obscure post-Kantian\n\nphilosopher, Jakob Fries ( 1773-1843).\n Friesian theory is little known today, but Fries does rate honorable\n\nmention by perhaps the greatest recent philosopher, Sir Karl Popper (\n\n1902-1994), who says, apropos of G.W.F. Hegel 's dialectical method: \" For the\n\ntruth is, I think, that it was not at first taken really seriously by serious\n\nmen ( such as Schopenhauer, or J.F. Fries)...\" [ Karl Popper, The Open\n\nSociety and Its Enemies Vol II, Princeton University Press, 1966 ( 1945), p.\n\n27].\n Popper himself, in his seminal The Logic of Scientific Discovery (\n\n1934), says that he considers his own system of thought a successor to the\n\nFriesian pattern, probably because Fries revived the Aristotelian principle\n\nthat not every proposition needs to be proven.\n Popper believed that scientific theories do not need to be proven\n\nbecause they are actually falsified instead.\n As with Schopenhauer, Fries was attempting to come to terms the\n\nproblems in the Critical Philosophy of Immanuel Kant. \n\n  Fries was not impressed by Kant 's arguments for belief based on\n\npractical reason.\n Like Kant, however, he did believe that the notions of God, freedom,\n\nand immortality are necessitated by reason.\n He concluded, in his Wissen, Glaube und Ahndung [ 1805; available in\n\nEnglish as Knowledge, Belief, and Aesthetic Sense, translated by Kent\n\nRichter, J\u00fcrgen Dinter Verlag, 1989], that we simply must accept that these\n\nconcepts spring from theoretical reason directly as, indeed, a kind of\n\nrational belief ( Glaube), which we will not be able to understand in the way\n\nthat we understand science or the world of experience ( what Fries called\n\nWissen, \" knowledge\").\n On the other hand, Fries was put off by the bloodless rationalism and\n\nmoralism of Kant 's theory.\n Kant had provided a place for feeling in his system, in the Third\n\nCritique, the Critique of Judgment ( 1790); but his view was that the\n\nfeelings of the beautiful and the sublime did not arise from any direct\n\nrelationship to external reality but only from a subjective harmony of our\n\nown mental faculties.\n Fries did not think such a theory was good enough.\n He thought that aesthetic and religious feelings were real cognitions\n\nof their objects but that they existed in dissociation from any concepts that\n\nwould make them real matters of Wissen or understanding.\n Kant himself had earlier believed in such an aesthetic realism, but\n\nhe later decided that only morality related directly to things-in-themselves.\n\n\n\n  Thus, after a fashion, Fries extended Kant 's own theory of the\n\nmind: Kant had thought that experience arose from the synthesis, the active\n\nunification, of sensations according to rules provided by pure concepts of\n\nthe understanding.\n Kant then figured that reason had some concepts, the Ideas of God,\n\nfreedom, and immortality, for which we have no corresponding sensations and\n\nso no corresponding experience or understanding.\n Fries merely added that there are corresponding sensations, aesthetic\n\nand religious feelings, but that synthesis, experience, and understanding\n\nstill do not actually occur between the sensations and concepts.\n Fries calls these feelings that we have independent of reason and\n\nunderstanding Ahndung, or \" intimation.?\n\n\n  Where Kant had thought that it was only through reason and\n\nmorality that we are related to things-in- themselves, Fries adds that there\n\nis a component of feeling to this relationship as well.\n Fries was thus bound to see religion differently from Kant.\n In Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone ( 1793), Kant had\n\nreduced religion to a phenomenon of reason and morality.\n Kant believed, indeed, that morality was what religion was all about\n\nand that it provided a basis for rational belief in concepts like God,\n\nfreedom, and immortality; but this provided no ground for any other aspects\n\nof traditional religious practice, belief, or experience.\n Fries was able to add an important component, that the central aspect\n\nof religion was not so much reason as feeling.\n But Fries still provided little room for most of the traditional\n\ncontents of religion.\n Even though both Kant and Fries were, in some general and cultural\n\nsense, Christians, there was nevertheless no reason in their systems of\n\nphilosophy to believe anything more than that Jesus Christ was a particularly\n\ngood moral teacher.\n Fries might make Jesus some kind of poet in addition, but there was\n\nstill no way that he could admit anything like traditional Christian views\n\nabout the status and function of Jesus in the nature of reality or the scheme\n\nof salvation.\n Indeed, Fries had a moral objection to the idea that Jesus might have\n\nsuffered for our sins and redeemed us from damnation.\n Salvation itself could only remain an alien concept to both Kant and\n\nFries, but it is hard to see what something like Christianity ( or Islam or\n\nHinduism or Buddhism) could possibly mean as a religion without the idea of\n\nsalvation. \n\n  Kant and Fries thus both represent a strong sort of philosophical\n\nrationalism, albeit one with much more room for something like religion than\n\nthe reductionistic materialism that became common in the 19th century (\n\ncontinued and continuing among many in the 20th).\n Fries himself was simply forgotten until rediscovered by a later\n\nGerman philosopher, Leonard Nelson ( 1882-1927).\n Nelson added little beyond lucid exposition and restatement to\n\nFries 's view of religion, but Nelson did introduce Fries to a colleague of\n\nhis at the University of G\u00f6ttingen: Rudolf Otto.\n Otto had a clear sense that there was much more to religious feeling\n\nthan what his philosopher friend allowed through a sense of the beautiful and\n\nthe sublime.\n But he also thought that there was no reason not to add that extra\n\nfeeling into the very fine metaphysical and epistemological framework, the\n\ntheory of Ahndung, that Kant and Fries had actually provided.\n Thus, as a purely descriptive matter, Otto believed that we are\n\nrelated to the transcendent, not just through morality, and not just through\n\nthe beautiful and the sublime, but through a sense of the holy and the\n\nsacred, categories of value that are unique and characteristic of religion.\n\n\n\n  Otto takes the Latin word numen, \" the might of a deity, majesty,\n\ndivinity,\" and coins the term \" numinous\" to describe either religious\n\nfeelings or the religious aspect attributed by those feelings to experiences\n\nand objects.\n He characterizes the feelings as involving 1) ultimacy, 2) mystery (\n\nmysterium), 3) awe ( tremendum), 4) fascination ( fascinans), and 5)\n\nsatisfaction.\n Unassociated with any objects, the sense of the numinous is a feeling\n\nof \" daemonic dread,\" a sense of the uncanny, frightful, eerie, weird, or\n\nsupernatural.\n These feelings make us feel vulnerable and overpowered, what Otto\n\ncalls \" creature feeling.\"", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c5775064-dd2c-4978-a493-a3ad20e4cddc", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.867253+00:00"}
{"text": "HOW TO FLY RC HELICOPTERS - -\n\n\n General size rule here is to stick with a heli with a rotor diameter of\n\nno less than 600mm - anything smaller than that is very difficult to control\n\nand next to impossible to learn on.\n Don't try to learn on a hobby grade micro electric - - they are just\n\ntoo sensitive and fragile; especially ones with electric tail rotor motors (\n\nas you know by know, I despise electric tail rotors on hobby grade machines).\n A 400 size electric is pretty much the smallest you want to go\n\nwith.\n\n  Other than size, your helicopter should have collective pitch and\n\nnot be fixed pitch.\n As you know by now, I believe strongly if you get into hobby grade RC\n\nhelicopters, you should start out with a larger good quality kit that has\n\ncollective pitch.\n After all, this hobby is expensive enough, and you don't want to have\n\nto go out and purchase a new helicopter in a few weeks or spend a few hundred\n\ndollars on upgrades after you learn how to hover. \n\n  Spending a little more money now, will save you lots of money in\n\nthe long run - - purchase a RC heli that you can grow with.\n This means your helicopter will have the potential to perform light to\n\naggressive aerobatics when set up to do so.\n When you are learning to fly RC helicopters however, you want to set\n\nyour heli up as a RC helicopter trainer. \n\n  This is accomplished by reducing the collective, throttle range,\n\nand cyclic pitch settings so the helicopter is less sensitive and doesn't\n\nhave the large control range that could get you into trouble very quickly.\n\n\n\n  I have actually written an e-book that goes into great detail of\n\nwhat settings make this possible, how to do it, and why.\n The examples are given on a Blade 400 RC heli, but can be applied to\n\nlarger and different machines as I explain in the e-book. \n\n  How important is correct setup?\n It the single most important aspect of learning how to fly any\n\ncollective pitch RC helicopter in my opinion.\n Here are some general values to get you started, my e-Book goes into\n\nmuch more detail... \n\n  Set your low stick collective pitch in the plus 1 to 2 degree\n\nrange - this will give softer landings, and minimize the chance of auguring\n\nyour RC heli into the ground.\n Set half stick collective pitch to around + 4.5 to +5 degrees - - a\n\nnice mid range pitch to hover at for most RC helicopters.\n Set your high collective pitch to about +6 to +7 degrees - this will\n\nensure you can't accidentally rocket 30 feet into the air in the blink of an\n\neye.\n There are no pitch angles for this because the pitch angles keep\n\nchanging depending on your collective angle.\n The easiest way is to set your cyclic commands to about half of their\n\nfull movement range.\n Look at the swashplate when it is set at the normal range of\n\nmovement.\n\n\n  Most people will use the dual rate function on their radio for\n\nthis.\n You might find you even want to decrease the movement even more - -\n\nup to 75% less cyclic movement depending on your specific helicopter.\n Start out with half and on day 3 or 4 of your lessons, you might want\n\nto reduce cyclic travel even more if you find your bird too sensitive. \n\n  You should also have your flybar weights set quite far out on\n\nyour fly bars to help make the cyclic control a little less responsive.\n Weights further out on the flybars will also help reduce the effects\n\nof wind gusts on your RC chopper. \n\n  This is very dependent on the helicopter kit and the gyro used.\n Set tail rotor movement range as per the manufactures instructions.\n Your gyro gain setting will dictate how sensitive your tail rotor\n\ncontrol is.\n More on this in the gyro setup below.\n If your radio has a dual rate switch for the tail rotor - a 50%\n\nsetting is usually a good starting point for most setups. \n\n  Before computerized programmable radios, we had to do this with\n\ntricky servo and throttle arm geometry angles to produce a large amount of\n\nthrottle movement in the first half of stick movement and a fairly small\n\namount of throttle movement during the upper half of stick movement.\n Today things are much easier with programmable throttle/pitch curves.\n This holds true for electric RC helicopters as well, as you will have\n\nto program the pitch curve and throttle curve to give the correct amount of\n\npower during half stick hover.\n\n\n  No matter what power option you use, make sure you set it up so\n\nyou can turn the engine/motor completely off with your throttle trim in the\n\nlow position.\n Most electric speed controllers simply won't arm ( power up) if the\n\nthrottle trim is not set low enough when first turned on.\n If you are not 100% familiar with your RC Radio, now is the time to\n\nre-read the instructions that came with it.\n Computerized radios are somewhat complicated and it can take some\n\ntime to get everything programmed and sorted out correctly. \n\n  Ensure all servos are moving in the correct direction and\n\ninteracting correctly with your servo reversing switches or swashplate setup\n\nprogramming.\n For example, if you give a forward cyclic command; make sure your\n\nswash plate tilts forward and not backwards or side ways.\n Likewise for left and right cyclic when viewing the swash plate from\n\nbehind the helicopter - - left stick movement makes the swash plate tilt left\n\nand a right command tilts it to the right.\n An increase in your throttle stick should show an increase in both\n\nyour collective pitch and in your engine/motor speed. \n\n  The instructions that come with the heli kit should indicate what\n\ndirection your servo arm moves when given a left or right command.\n Seeing that tail rotor servo placement, main rotor and tail rotor\n\nrotational direction, and if the tail rotor is on the left or right side of\n\nthe tail boom all play a roll in determining direction, there are many\n\ndifferent set up possibilities.\n The easiest way to confirm if you have things set up correctly is to\n\nmake sure if you give a right tail rotor command, you see the pitch of the\n\ntail rotor change so it blows or thrusts the tail boom to the left ( nose of\n\nthe helicopter turns right) and vice-versa for a left command. \n\n  There are two things you want to confirm with your gyro set up.\n First off, is it correcting the tail rotor in proper direction?\n If you hold your helicopter by the rotor head and swing the nose to\n\nthe right ( rotating your helicopter clockwise), you should see the tail\n\nrotor servo move to give a left tail rotor command just as if you were giving\n\na left stick command; vice versa for a sudden left ( counter clockwise)\n\nhelicopter yaw movement.\n If the movements are opposite of what they should be, simply use the\n\ngyro reverse switch to change the direction of correction and re-test. \n\n  The next gyro function you want to set is the amount of \" Gain\"\n\nor how sensitive the gyro is.\n Most RC helicopter kits and gyro instructions will have starting\n\npoint recommendations and you should follow those.\n As a general rule, I usually set the gain to about 55-65% as a good\n\nstarting point ( but it depends on the gyro/heli combination).\n If you have a remote gain feature with your gyro ( the ability to\n\nchange the sensitivity of the gyro from your radio) you could set one value\n\nat 55% and the other at 65% for example and see which preforms best by the\n\nsimple flick of a toggle switch. \n\n  You most likely have already done this if you followed your\n\nhelicopter building instructions, but now is a good time to recheck the\n\ncenter of gravity or \" CG\" for short.\n The CG is simply the balance point of the helicopter.\n You will always want your CG at or a little forward of the main rotor\n\nmast.\n How do you check it?\n Simply hold your helicopter by the flybar so the helicopter can pivot\n\nforward and backwards.\n If your helicopter is level or tilts a bit forward that is perfect.\n If it tilts backwards, that is the last thing you want when learning.\n Move your receiver battery pack a bit closer to the nose of the\n\nhelicopter and recheck. \n\n  If you have an electric RC heli, you can move your main battery\n\npack a little more forward or backward to get the CG in the sweet spot.\n It is generally common practice to check your CG if you have a fuel\n\npowered model with the fuel tank half full and adjust with the receiver\n\nbattery pack as required. \n\n  All RC helicopter rotor blades ( main and tail) are held onto the\n\nblade grips with a single bolt and lock nut.\n The tightness of this bolt and nut are very important and I have seen\n\nmany people ( newbies and seasoned fliers alike) under or over tighten them -\n\nI was guilty of this for years myself. \n\n  There are several methods to check if you have your rotor blades\n\ntightened the correct amount - this is the method I like the best.\n For your main rotor blades, simply hold your helicopter sideways to\n\nthe ground with the main rotor blades out straight from the blade holders,\n\nhorizontal to the ground.\n The bolts should be tight enough so the blades don't pivot in the\n\nblade holders downwards by the pull of gravity but they should be loose\n\nenough to move if you shake your heli up and down. \n\n  Now, I should mention as the birds get larger, you have to\n\ntighten the blade bolts more as the blades have much more mass.\n Once over 700mm blade size ( not rotor diameter), blade bolt torque\n\nis so important and on big blades like these, you generally have to tighten\n\nthe bolts so tight, the blades won't move when the heli is held sideways and\n\nshaken.\n If large blades like this are too loose, they will lag during spool\n\nup or down.\n Depending on both mass of the blade and the amount of lag, this lag\n\ncould shake your bird apart due to the effects of ground resonance and an out\n\nof balance head caused by blade lead/lag. \n\n  Here is a pretty good video I found of ground resonance on a full\n\nsize Chinook helicopter.\n Our RC birds will shake faster during ground resonance since the\n\nrotor speeds are higher but they shake the exact same way ( don't ask how I\n\nlearned this).\n Tail rotor blade bolt adjustment is very much the same.\n They should be tightened just enough to prevent the tail rotor blades\n\nfrom pivoting down in the blade holder due to the pull of gravity on them.\n Same on large or small birds since tail rotor mass is always very\n\nlow. \n\n  As I have indicated several times in this web site, RC\n\nhelicopters are potentially the most dangerous of all RC vehicles.\n When you are first learning how to fly RC helicopters, specifically\n\nlearning how to hover, the danger is not as great as it is be when you are\n\nstarting to fly around.\n After all, the heli will ( hopefully) be staying in one fixed\n\nlocation close to the ground more or less.\n The reason you want to think a bit about safety right now on day 1 is\n\nto determine where you will be going for your first hover attempts during\n\ndays 3 and 4.\n The last thing you want is a location with many people around.\n This is not only dangerous for them, but very distracting for you.\n You should go out alone or with one person maximum to assist you.\n If you learn at a RC helicopter club, they should have a practice\n\narea away from the main flight line.\n You will need maximum concentration - - distractions are the worst!\n\n\n\n  This is not the time to have all your buds come out and watch\n\nyour first baby steps.\n Also leave Fido at home - - man have I heard some pretty messy horror\n\nstories about dogs going after RC helicopters.\n Almost happened to me once with an off leash dog, but that is another\n\nstory.\n You will need a nice large open area free of any obstacles.\n Clean dust free pavement or packed snow/ice are the best choices (\n\nmore on this during Day 3).\n When learning to hover, you won't need as much room as when you start\n\nflying circuits, but you should have an area of at least 20m by 20m ( 60 feet\n\nby 60 feet) the bigger the better.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0b3bfd69-13e2-4236-b97e-9c71eb731df8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.868617+00:00"}
{"text": "More radical than the comedy of satire and the comedy of nihilism,\n\nthe comedy of celebration references powerlessness as good - and the good in\n\npowerlessness.\n Jerome A. Miller\n\n\n  has an ominous\n\nring to it.\n It evokes an image of philosophy stooping to conquer yet another\n\ndimension of human experience - bringing its sober light to bear on an\n\nespecially dark corner of the cave in which we dwell.\n Philosophy, as usual, assumes the position of the master term, and\n\nreduces comedy to the status of an objective genitive.\n\n  Philosophy has traditionally claimed this privileged position on\n\nthe ground that it alone can provide the ultimate rational explanation of the\n\nexperiences it scrutinizes.\n philosophy\n\nof religion  and  philosophy of art  is meant to be\n\ntaken seriously: it implies that religion and art must turn to philosophy to\n\nfind their identity; it is the source of their seriousness and the progenitor\n\nof their legitimacy.\n Moreover, philosophy holds a monopoly on ultimate questions so that\n\nits sovereignty over ultimacy seems to be beyond question.\n suggests that, like\n\neverything else, comedy is subject to philosophy 's authoritative\n\njudgment.\n\n  This would, indeed, be the case - were it not for the fact that\n\ncomedy laughs until it cries at all the attempts made by philosophy to master\n\nit.' As if there were any chance at all that philosophy might possibly have\n\nthe last laugh.\n As if the most laughable thing in the whole universe was not\n\nphilosophy itself, with its pretension to be ultimately serious, beyond\n\nquestion, exempt from fallibility.\n What engenders laughter is philosophy 's very attempt to subsume\n\nlaughter, to silence it with philosophical seriousness, to deny the comedy of\n\nits own performances.\n What is funniest of all is the humorless of philosophy itself, its\n\nrefusal to laugh at its own ridiculousness.\n From comedy 's point of view, philosophy is never more hilarious than\n\nwhen it is speaking seriously. \n\n  To let comedy be, and not try to subsume it, in fact to allow it\n\nits own voice, to let it play its practical jokes and make us the butt of its\n\nmerciless satire - this would be an alternative to the philosophy of comedy\n\nin the conventional sense.\n But what if comedy, allowed free rein, turns out to have its own kind\n\nof ultimacy, a syllabus of unavoidable banana peels, a tack to put under\n\nevery one of our assumptions?\n This too would be a philosophy of comedy but under the regimen of an\n\nentirely different genitive.\n I do not mean that comedy would itself assume a regal bearing and\n\npresume to occupy the privileged position claimed by philosophy - for that\n\nwould be only to change roles and leave the old regimen intact.\n I mean, rather, that comedy may be able to generate a philosophy that\n\neschews all privilege and is permeated by the sense of the ridiculous; a\n\nphilosophy, yes, because it would be ultimate and impossible to transcend -\n\nnot, however, by virtue of the heights to which it would be brought by a\n\ncomic deconstruction.\n It is a philosophy of comedy in this sense I would like to explore\n\nhere.\n\n\n  Let us begin with satiric irreverence, with the body announcing\n\nits noises on those occasions when it is supposed to completely efface\n\nitself: the body full of sound and fury, and apparently signifying nothing.2\n Ordinarily, we try to make our sounds conform to the etiquette of\n\nsense so that they inconspicuously and deferentially serve our meanings.\n Even in music sound does not come into its own but surrenders to\n\nrhythm, harmony, melody - unless someone is listening to P. D. Q. Bach who,\n\nby striking the exact wrong note, lets sound stand out, naked and\n\npreposterous, with all its absurdity revealed.3\n Just the body is not visible when we see the other 's face, even when\n\nthere is no make-up to dissemble its natural surface; the face itself\n\ndisguises the body - until something like Cyrano 's nose or the gap between\n\nLetterman 's teeth reveals it.\n We cover up the parts of the body which are so bodily that it is hard\n\nto reduce them to sense at all, or make them serve any signifying purpose.\n But the body never quite holds together, even when subjected to the\n\nmost exacting surveillance of diet and exercise; no aerobic prevents its\n\nfated excretions or unbidden erections.\n\n  Still, the higher, the more important our signifying purposes,\n\nthe graver, the more compelling is the exigence to overcome the gravity of\n\nthe body: before any sacred event begins, it is surrounded with a taboo\n\nagainst sound of any sort - a sacral silence which spectators and\n\nparticipants alike feel compelled to respect.\n But, as children are especially quick to sense, this silence, even if\n\nnot broken inappropriately, is itself on the verge of being funny: in part\n\nbecause of the incongruity between this sudden seriousness and our ordinary\n\nmanner, but primarily because, in assuming this etiquette, we aspire to a\n\nseriousness that is beyond us.\n The manners incumbent on us as we enter sacred space for wedding and\n\nfunerals - the special garb, the dignity of ritual movement, the solemn grace\n\nof ceremony - all serve to eliminate any hint of the slippery and awkward\n\nbody, of its excesses or frailties, its feckless demands and inescapable\n\nincompetencies.\n\n  But we cannot keep a straight face when we chance to see the\n\npreposterous body at the very moment when we are trying to take ourselves\n\nmore seriously.\n Four\n\nWeddings and a Funeral  is so discombobulated by the seriousness of the\n\noccasion that he makes a travesty of it.\n What is funny in all such situations is the incongruity4 between our\n\nearnest solemnity and the very body by virtue of which it must be enacted.\n The body is not an instrument we can replace or a symbol we can\n\ncontest; it is inescapably  us  .\n The ridiculousness of the very body which performs our most solemn\n\nrituals profanes them.\n There is no liturgy that is not liable to decompose into comedy.\n Unable to detach from the body, we can never feel that the\n\nseriousness with which we take ourselves is wholly safe and secure.\n\n  The satirist, ombudsman of the ridiculous, pulls the ground up\n\nfrom under the feet of those authorized to insure that the sacred is\n\nreverenced and not blasphemed: the comedian reveals, to these authorities and\n\nto us, that they too not only have bodies but they are subject to their\n\nincompetencies, can fall and are as fall-ible as those subject to the\n\ninstitutions over which they preside.\n Lear 's fool would love to turn Shakespeare 's play into a comedy by\n\nexposing his king 's repressed absurdities.\n No one who purports to exercise power on behalf of sacred order is\n\nexempt from such absurdities, not even those most held up for veneration in\n\nthe sanctuary, the capitol, the academy.\n These places could be kept wholly sacrosanct only if everything\n\nridiculous - and this means every human - were excluded from them; those who\n\npreside over them must try harder than anyone else to disassociate themselves\n\nfrom the ridiculous precisely because the most obvious of incongruities might\n\nbe that someone incompetent fully to control his own bowels should be our\n\nparagon - our founding paradigm of wisdom, through whom the ultimately sacred\n\nbecomes accessible to us.\n Similarly, it is ridiculous, as Kierkegaard reminds us, for a man to\n\nplight his eternal troth to the beloved, whom he is unworthy to touch, by\n\npresenting to her his body when it is in the most preposterous of all its\n\nconditions.5\n\n  We laugh at these incongruities because we appreciate them as\n\nsuch and get their painfully funny point.\n\n\nand  The Misanthrope  , the incongruity may not be caused by any\n\novert bodily affront but turn on some vulnerability that threatens to bring\n\n low  the ( usually male) protagonist; and even the lowest\n\ncomedies, such as  Animal House  , depend on our appreciating what\n\nit is that the crudities of the body profane.\n It is not the body which gets the point, even when the point is most\n\nliterally the preposterous idea that mind can be master of the body.6\n Indeed, because normal intelligence is so easily taken in by\n\nconventional assumptions that it is incapable of suspecting the\n\nincompetencies and frailties they disguise, it takes not just the\n\neccentricity of genius but the peculiar genius of eccentricity to hit the\n\nfunny bone at exactly the right angle, to spring the punch line at just the\n\nright moment, with exactly the right inflection.\n This is a kind of prudence that ethics traditionally overlooks\n\nbecause what, from the comic point of view, is the  right  act\n\nat the  right  time in the  right  way is\n\nalways, from the viewpoint of conventional morality, an impropriety, the one\n\nthing not to be done.\n Hence the unnerving perversity of the comic, the freakish character\n\nof its Gumpish genius, the dangerous, anarchic - Groucho Marxist- import of\n\nits wisdom.\n\n  But wisdom, nevertheless: because the comic cuts so close to the\n\nbone, makes us realize the very things we were determined to deny or\n\noverlook, exposes us at the very points where we are most vulnerable.\n Having located them, it does not hesitate to inflict a wound, even a\n\nmortal one.\n ,\n\nwhere Miss Hardcastle sets out to expose the very flaw, fault, incompetence,\n\nfallibility that Marlowe has spent his life trying to overcome or repress.\n What gives comic wisdom its ultimacy, makes it wisdom and not mere\n\nwit or cleverness, is that it shows no mercy.\n It does not stop at reminding the mind of the body: it reminds us\n\nthat our being as a whole is liable to nothingness and has no escape from it.\n The black comedy of Beckett exposes the ultimate and most\n\npreposterous incongruity - that we, who would be being, who presume to be\n\nbeing itself, are not just the mercy of nothingness, but are ourselves no\n\nmore than little bits of nothing.7\n\n  This means that satiric irreverence thrives on the very\n\npresumptions and pretensions it undermines.\n The ridiculous is parasitic upon our higher sense, and absurdity\n\ndepends on the meanings we take seriously.\n The humor is not the banana peel but in the sight of the Hegelian\n\nslipping on it.\n Comedy 's incongruities are deconstructive, and deconstruction itself\n\nis comic genius: not another theory in the conventional sense but comedy\n\ncarried into the inner sanctuary of philosophy to satirize philosophy that\n\ntakes itself seriously.\n Is such comedy itself to be taken seriously?\n Is any comedy to be taken seriously or is doing so a ( comic)\n\nmisreading of its meaning?\n Does the brilliance of the deconstruction imply that the comedian\n\ndeserves exemption from deconstruction?\n Or is comedy a deconstruction from which nothing, not even the\n\ncomedian, is meant to be exempt?\n\n\n  Let us consider this last possibility.\n It requires that comedians laugh at themselves.\n Here, the eccentricities of comic logic are complicated by the\n\npeculiar paradoxes of self-reference.\n\n  It is sometimes claimed that self-referential statements are\n\nsemantically incoherent, and that a statement about language, in order to be\n\ncoherent, must belong to a meta-language located on one level above the\n\nlanguage it is about.8\n If this were the case, it would be possible to be radically critical\n\nof oneself only by differentiating oneself from, and raising oneself above,\n\nthe self being criticized.\n What an attractive proposition: I will criticize myself by ...escaping\n\nto a higher level.\n One could then get the jump on all one 's possible critics by making a\n\nmeta-move on oneself, and in the process end up in an even higher position\n\nthan that occupied before.\n By distinguishing the critic in myself from the self being\n\ncriticized, the deconstructionist from the deconstructed, the wry ironist\n\nfrom the object of my ironies, the person who laughs from the person who is\n\nlaughed at - even though they both occupy the same body - I am able to laugh\n\nat myself in a way that  improves  my stature.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6a014e42-695a-4bb1-8deb-0340a7ca84a2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.869837+00:00"}
{"text": "After fumbling the future,Xerox PARC is back with a visionary new\n\ndirector, bright researchers, and amazing new technology. \n\n  In 1983, I read an article about mind-amplifying machines.\n These were as different from the computers of the time as television\n\nwas from 15th century printing presses.\n The article 's author, Alan Kay, worked at Xerox Palo Alto Research\n\nCenter ( PARC).\n I concluded that PARC amounted to a hive of zealots bent on changing\n\nthe course of culture.\n I wanted in on it.\n Most of all, I wanted to test drive one of the devices they used to\n\namplify their own minds. \n\n  I managed to get a job at PARC writing articles for a Xerox\n\nin-house magazine.\n A year before the first Macintosh computer was sold, I commuted 45\n\nminutes to PARC 's rural campus to type on an Alto - the first true personal\n\ncomputer.\n My job was to interview PARC researchers about their work.\n They talked about bit-mapped screens, local-area networks,\n\npoint-and-click interfaces, object-oriented languages.\n All those futuristic experiments they showed me have diffused so\n\nwidely ( and profitably) during the past ten years that it is easy to forget\n\nthey were once confined to that building on a oak-spotted hill above Silicon\n\nValley. \n\n  The players on the all-virtuoso team that convened then at PARC 's\n\ncomputer labs were eager to volunteer as guinea pigs for the technology they\n\nwanted to build.\n They were dedicated to designing their own personal, networked mind-\n\namplifiers, then handing over their creations to non-programmers for\n\nintellectual work.\n One phrase became PARC 's hallmark: \" The easiest way to predict the\n\nfuture is to invent it.\"\n They succeeded so well that nothing has been the same since,\n\nincluding PARC. \n\n  The early days of PARC are the stuff of Silicon Valley folklore.\n Personal computers did not spring naturally from the computer\n\nindustry.\n They were deliberately realized by a radical fringe, against all the\n\nforce of the day 's accepted wisdom. \n\n  These zealous wizards handed Xerox an astounding lead in\n\ninformation technology in the early 1980s, but by the end of the decade,\n\nXerox watched as upstarts like Apple and Microsoft grew wealthy off Xerox 's\n\ndiscoveries.\n Neither Apple nor Microsoft even existed when the first Altos were\n\ndesigned in the early 1970s; by 1990 either company could have bought Xerox.\n The tragicomic Xerox saga is recorded in Douglas K. Smith and Robert\n\nC. Alexander 's Fumbling the Future.\n\n  But Xerox hasn't always fumbled the future.\n The company persists because long ago it redefined itself and\n\nreinvented its business.\n Fifty years ago, Chester Carlson invented a scheme for printing dry\n\nphotocopies of documents.\n Few corporations of the day were interested in an expensive, messy,\n\nunreliable way to do what carbon paper did cheaply and well.\n Nonetheless, Carlson 's company, Haloid, committed itself to a future\n\nin which people would use office copiers for purposes unimaginable in the\n\ncarbon-paper era.\n Renaming itself Xerox, the company championed the copiers that soon\n\nrendered carbon-paper obsolete. \n\n  Having already invented the future twice, then squandering its\n\nadvantage, could Xerox still have stories to tell? In the fall of 1993, I\n\nreturned to Xerox PARC for another chance to go back to the future.\n Where was Xerox? On the road to reinventing itself for the third\n\ntime. \n\n  New, young faces populate the halls today.\n Video windows and audio communications are built into workstations.\n Desktop screens have evolved into wall-sized screens, clipboard-size\n\nscreens, and pocket-size \" tabs.\" The place is still an intellectual\n\nwonderland.\n Again I feel like I've dropped in on 've outpost from the future.\n It 's not just the latest gadgetry.\n Something 's happening.\n The hardware and software shops are still cooking up new goodies, but\n\nnow anthropologists and sociologists study the nature of knowledge work and\n\nthe way organizations function.\n These scientists are as important at PARC today as are inventors of\n\nthin-film displays or engineers of RISC processors. \n\n  In the 1970s and 1980s everybody at PARC shared a mental model of\n\nthe future - they predicted that millions of people would soon use screens\n\nand windows and mice, linked to high-speed communication pipelines.\n But now in the 1990s, nothing seems as easy to forecast or design as\n\npersonal computing and networking were.\n This time, the folks at PARC are taking their info-tools into\n\nrelatively uncharted territory - what happens among people. \n\n  Personal computers and local-area-networks are boxes of\n\nelectronics, cables that transport bits.\n But once they are in place, the effects on organization are more\n\npowerful than number-crunching and file-transferring: People use those boxes\n\nand cables to think, communicate, and solve problems in new ways.\n Those new ways are not visible, but they represent the raison d'etre\n\nof innovative information processing and communicating tools.\n These tools, after all, don't generate electrical power or material\n\ngoods.\n Through the interaction of minds, they effect changes in human\n\nrelationships, and through those, changes in organizations.\n This territory - what happens to people 's minds and to organizations\n\nafter personal computers and networks are installed - is the new terra\n\nincognita that PARC researchers are exploring.\n What they have discovered so far, in the earliest phases of the\n\nresearch, is both startling and inspiring. \n\n\n  The first person at PARC I talked to this time around was Mark\n\nWeiser.\n I had never met this smiling, bearded fellow before, but I recognized\n\nthe room he was standing in.\n\n\n  I sat on the same couch in the same corner office with the same\n\nview of Palo Alto ten years earlier when Bob Taylor was director of PARC 's\n\ncomputer science lab.\n At that time, as now, PARC was a one-stop shop for everything from\n\nnew microcircuits ( and new ways of making microcircuits) to new computer\n\nsystems and new software.\n Taylor had been a young administrator who led a stellar,\n\nsingle-minded team for more than a decade, with legendary results.\n Taylor and his crew were the heirs to Douglas Engelbart 's crusade to\n\n\" augment human intellect\" at the Stanford Research Institute. \n\n  As silly as it seems today, there was a time when almost\n\neverybody in the computer industry was convinced that computers were destined\n\nsolely for calculation or data processing.\n Engelbart, a lonely visionary, pushed the radical idea that computers\n\ncould be used to extend the power of human minds to think, communicate, and\n\nsolve problems - this was \" augmentation.\" There was a threshold out there,\n\nTaylor 's early PARC team believed, measured in processing power, where true\n\nintellectual augmentation would take place - the way 24-frames-a-second marks\n\nthe boundary between still photography and cinema. \n\n  Bob Taylor 's motto had been \" Build what you use.\n Use what you build.\" One of the first things Mark Weiser shared was\n\nhis own interpretation of this now hoary PARC wisdom: \" You let what you\n\nbuild change you, and you move on.\" In Weiser 's view, PARC learns how to\n\nbuild better tools, and then everybody learns to use them.\n Then they do it all again, with the new tools.\n The people at PARC have a hunch that this organizational\n\nbootstrapping might be worth more to Xerox than the tangible artifacts the\n\nprocess produces. \n\n  The early computer science lab crew stood on a mountain, and the\n\ndestination was clear.\n The sights of Weiser and company are more arcane - they are mapping\n\naspects of intellectual work that have yet to be explored. \n\n  Weiser wants computers to disappear into the background.\n When computers become invisible to users, the most important side of\n\nhuman-computer symbiosis ( to humans) has a better chance to emerge.\n How to make them invisible? Make them ubiquitous. \"\n\n\n  To Weiser, the intellectual origins of \" Ubicomp\" lie in the\n\nsocial rather than the technical side of PARC 's research: \" The idea of\n\nubiquitous computing first arose from contemplating the place of today 's\n\ncomputer in actual activities of everyday life,\" he writes in a recent paper. \"\n In particular, anthropological studies of work life teach us that\n\npeople primarily work in a world of shared situations and unexamined\n\ntechnological skills. However, the computer today is isolated from the\n\noverall situation and fails to get out of the way of the work.\" \n\n  In Weiser 's cosmology, the original \" desktop\" graphical user\n\ninterface does not go far enough to get out of the way of the user.\n Interfaces don't do the job.\n Neither do agents.\n And certainly not virtual reality ( VR).\n Weiser writes: \" In its ultimate environment, VR causes the computer\n\nto become effectively invisible by taking over the human sensory and affector\n\nsystems.\n VR is extremely useful in scientific visualization and entertainment,\n\nand will be very significant for those niches.\n But as a tool for productively changing everyone 's relationship to\n\ncomputation, it has two crucial flaws.\n First, at the present time [ 1992], and probably for decades, it\n\ncannot produce a simulation of significant verisimilitude at reasonable cost.\n That means that users will not be fooled and the computer will not be\n\nout of the way.\n Second, and most importantly, it has the goal of fooling the user -\n\nof leaving the everyday physical world behind.\n This is at odds with the goal of better integrating the computer into\n\nhuman activities, since humans are of and in the everyday world.\" \n\n  Embedding intelligence in the environment is not possible with\n\npresent-day technology, so Weiser 's group started with wall-sized interactive\n\nscreens known as \" boards,\" clipboard-sized terminals known as \" pads,\" and\n\ntiny computers called \" tabs.\"\n The first stages of Ubicomp bootstrapping incorporated another\n\ninnovation, first created by Olivetti 's research center in Cambridge, England\n\n- an \" active badge.\"\n With an active badge system, every computer you sit down at is your\n\ncomputer, with your custom interface and access to your files, because your\n\nactive badge sends it information via infrared signals.\n It is possible to track the locations of other researchers at all\n\ntimes by central monitoring of active badges - a handy tool with Orwellian\n\nimplications. \n\n  In his office, Weiser drew a horizontal line.\n The far left side he labeled \" atoms\"; the far right side, \"\n\ncultures.\"\n PARC, Weiser points out, directs research at every part of the\n\nspectrum defined by the line between atoms and cultures: toward the \" atom\"\n\nend of the line is PARC 's ongoing exploration of the nature of materials.\n Toward the center lies PARC 's work in turning materials into real\n\nhardware products.\n Smack in the middle is the task tackled by Taylor and his group,\n\nintegrating hardware and software design into information systems.\n And toward the right, closer to \" cultures,\" are systems and\n\npractices - the hunting grounds of social scientists. \n\n  The lab 's new direction, Weiser says, \" recognizes even more that\n\npeople are social creatures.\"\n He referred to his ideas as a form of \" postmodern computing,\" in\n\nthat he wants to \" return to letting things in the world be what they are,\n\ninstead of reducing them\" to data or virtualizing them into illusions.\n \" Ubicomp honors the complexity of human relationships, the fact that\n\nwe have bodies, are mobile,\" he said.\n Tabs, pads, boards, and badges are the first bootstrapping steps in\n\nthat direction, not the long-term goal.\n Nevertheless, part of that environment has migrated into productland\n\nand is embodied in the \" LiveBoard\" ( see WIRED 1.4, page 36).\n\n  PARC teams are way beyond \" fumbling the future.\"\n They are inventing the future again.\n But this time they are reinventing their understanding of how to\n\ninvent the future, as well.\n There is a sense that they are onto something new, that instead of\n\nextending the old computer revolution into new widgets and gadgets, they are\n\nat the dawn of a whole new - and potentially scary - revolution.\n\n\n  PARC is an intellectual playground, full of free spirits.\n How do they feel about the possibility that Ubicomp might lead\n\ndirectly to a future of safe, efficient, soulless, and merciless universal\n\nsurveillance? \n\n  \" Some people refuse to wear badges,\" Weiser says.\n \" I support their right to dissent.\n And one principle we go by here is to maintain individual control\n\nover who else sees anything about us....The answer will have to be social as\n\nwell as technical.\" \n\n\n  When computers disappear into the woodwork, people in\n\norganizations will do the same important thing people in organizations have\n\nalways done: They will tell each other stories.\n While workstations can amplify the work people do in their physical\n\ncubicles and formal job roles, boxes on desks can't approach what happens at\n\nthe water cooler.\n One PARC researcher, Pavel Curtis, is looking closely at MUDs, the\n\nwater coolers of the Internet.\n He sees them as a way of bringing informal, even playful\n\ncommunication back into organizations.\n In MUDs, the \" Multi-User Dungeons\" of the Internet, thousands of\n\nenthusiasts create their own dramatic adventures, sometimes vying for points\n\nin fantasy games, sometimes just conversing.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "efeb783b-1dcd-4ce2-b0ba-f7d7467b69b7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.871280+00:00"}
{"text": "Tuesday 's primary election had more than its share of surprises\n\nand close races.\n The voter turnout in the Savannah area - somewhere around 50 percent -\n\nwas encouraging as well.\n\n  The biggest shocker on the local scene was Joe Mahany 's upset of\n\nincumbent Chatham County Commission Chairman Robert McCorkle in the\n\nDemocratic primary.\n Mr. McCorkle, who has served on the commission for 22 years, was\n\nbeaten by Mr. Mahany by nearly a 2-to-1 margin.\n\n  The chairman 's defeat by members of his own party is a clear\n\nindication that voters want a change in leadership.\n The victor, Mr. Mahany, will face one of two Republicans, Commissioner\n\nJulie Smith or Ray Gaster, who were the top vote-getters in the Republican\n\nprimary.\n No matter who wins in the November general election, Chatham Countians\n\nwill begin 1993 with a new commission chairman on board.\n\n  In other contests, the crowded fields in the 1st District and 11th\n\nDistrict congressional races virtually guaranteed runoff elections, which\n\nwill be held Aug. 11.\n Barbara Christmas, a Democrat, ran a strong campaign in the 1st\n\nDistrict and will face either Buddy DeLoach or Bryan Ginn in the runoff.\n That winner will run against State Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah,\n\nwho easily won the Republican nomination.\n\n  In the newly-drawn 11th District, Cynthia McKinney and George\n\nDeLoach will vie for the Democratic nod, while Republicans Woodrow Lovett and\n\nSavannahian Michael Pratt will fight to carry their party 's flag.\n All four have an unenviable task, since this crazily configured\n\ndistrict stretches from Atlanta to Augusta to Savannah.\n\n  In various judgeship races, Charles Mikell handily won the\n\nelection for Superior Court judge, proving that his experience on the State\n\nCourt bench paid off.\n State Supreme Court Justice Leah Sears-Collins, a Savannah native,\n\nwon her race to keep her seat, guaranteeing a measure of diversity on the\n\nhigh court.\n\n  One disappointment was the statewide race between Labor\n\nCommissioner Al Scott and challenger David Poythress for the Democratic\n\nnomination.\n Mr. Scott has been doing an admirable job as labor commissioner; Mr.\n\nPoythress has been manufacturing issues and tossing mud.\n Unfortunately, the below-the-belt tactics apparently had an impact in\n\nthe three-person race ( Savannahian Frances Bright Johnson did surprisingly\n\nwell) and Mr. Scott and Mr. Poythress go into the runoff.\n\n  On a more upbeat note, local voters wisely chose to return\n\nDorothy Pelote and Tom Bordeaux to the Georgia House.\n There, they will be rejoined by Diane Harvey Johnson, who had little\n\ntrouble reclaiming her old House seat.\n\n  On the Chatham County Commission, Republican David Saussy turned\n\nback former chairman Bill Stephenson 's bid to get back on the board in the\n\n1st District.\n He goes on to face Democrat Marty Felser.\n Incumbent Deanie Frazier was the leading vote-getter in the 5th\n\nDistrict, but Democratic challenger Clifton Jones Jr. forced her into a\n\nrunoff.\n In the 7th District, Eddie DeLoach won his race and will follow in\n\nthe footsteps of his father, outgoing Commissioner James DeLoach.\n\n  In school board races, congratulations are in order for\n\nincumbents Daniel Washington and Andy Way and former State Rep. DeWayne\n\nHamilton.\n All three won their respective nominations, and Mr. Washington and\n\nMr. Hamilton will join the board because they have no opposition in the fall.\n\n\n  Credit is also due Tax Commissioner Barbara Kiley, who handily\n\nwon the Democratic nomination.\n\n\n  A final winner Tuesday was the voting public.\n Getting people to the polls for primaries isn't easy.\n\n\n  That 's a positive trend.\n It 's also one that the public, and the politicians, should try to\n\nbuild on through November and beyond.\n\n\n  Some local Democrats are getting some cheap laughs at the expense\n\nof President Bush, who still owes the city some\n\n&dollar;14,000 for a campaign visit here back in March.\n\n  Actually, that 's not too surprising.\n Most politicians are notoriously slow in paying their debts.\n\n\n  Still, it would behoove the president if he settled up with City\n\nHall sometime soon.\n While the delinquency isn't going to mean a thing to most voters, it\n\nhas to be a little embarrassing to his supporters.\n Besides, it 's not as if he 's strapped for cash.\n Published reports say that his campaign is sitting on a\n\n&dollar;7 million surplus from his primary campaign fund that he has to spend before\n\nthe Republican convention, so as to qualify for federal campaign funds in the\n\ngeneral election.\n\n  Coming across with\n\n&dollar;14,000 for the city of Savannah should be painless.\n And while that 's not a lot of money to the city either, local\n\ntaxpayers shouldn't have to foot the bills for political rallies, no matter\n\nwhich party stages them.\n\n  Thousands of area residents jammed the riverfront to see and hear\n\nthe president.\n He got its money 's worth for the pre-Georgia primary pick-me-up.\n\n\n\n  A month ago, Savannah seemed on its way to getting a 5-percent\n\ncut in federal flood insurance premiums.\n That was welcome news for residents and business owners who could use\n\nthe discount.\n\n  But lately, representatives for the Federal Emergency Management\n\nAgency changed their mind.\n The agency says it won't cut rates because of \" serious deficiencies\"\n\nin flood control here.\n\n  Why the sudden turnabout?\n And more importantly, how can it be resolved?\n Taxpayers are spending millions of public dollars to improve drainage\n\nin the community.\n Not so long ago, FEMA was applauding Savannah for some of the\n\nmeasures it was taking to improve flood control and reduce the risk of flood\n\ndamage.\n Happily, it looked as though the investment would soon be paying off\n\nthrough reduced insurance premiums.\n Now it appears the anticipated rate cut may be headed down the\n\ndrain.\n\n  The feds are faulting the city for allowing five buildings - four\n\nprivate homes, scattered from Coffee Bluff to west Savannah, and the Goodwill\n\nIndustries building - to be built below the nationally designated flood plain\n\nwithout adequate protection.\n\n  They also contend that several structures were given certificates\n\nof occupancy before the elevation was formally established, as required by\n\nFEMA regulations.\n\n  City Manager Don Mendonsa says this is the first he has heard\n\nabout any problems.\n He says all previous contacts with the agency had been positive.\n But Glenn Woodard, who works for the state Department of Natural\n\nResources and serves as FEMA 's representative, tells a different story.\n He contends that trouble was spotted last November, and that state\n\nand federal officials have unsuccessfully prodded the city for months to make\n\ncorrections.\n\n  It 's clear that a breakdown occurred somewhere.\n But what 's most important is to correct what 's wrong so Savannahians\n\ncan save a little money on their premiums.\n\n  Mr. Mendonsa says he will send a detailed explanation to FEMA\n\nabout the buildings constructed below the flood plain.\n That 's a start.\n Perhaps the agency can be persuaded to change its mind.\n After that, city and FEMA officials need to do a better job of\n\ncomparing notes so that such unhappy surprises don't happen again.\n\n\n  Responsible voters in Georgia have reason to be concerned about\n\nthe tone and direction of the state labor commissioner 's race.\n\n  Al Scott, the incumbent labor commissioner, is the target of a\n\nbarrage of ugly charges from challenger David Poythress, who has wound up\n\nopposing the incumbent in a runoff set for August.\n\n  A Savannahian and a former state legislator, Mr. Scott has\n\nperformed capably at the Department of Labor, but you wouldn't know that if\n\nyou listen to his opponent.\n\n  It is fair for a candidate to question his opponent 's\n\nqualifications and competence.\n But Mr. Poythress goes well beyond that.\n He exceeds the limits of fairness.\n He emphasizes at every opportunity the race of Mr. Scott.\n This is blatant.\n\n\n  A black, Mr. Scott was appointed to his post by Gov. Zell Miller.\n\n\n  In addition, Mr. Poythress claims Mr. Scott took a bribe.\n This is an unsubstantiated charge that is not borne out by the FBI\n\ntapes Mr. Poythress claims are supportive of his allegations.\n\n  The tapes were made by an undercover agent operating a 'sting'\n\nagainst another state legislator.\n The legislator, Rep. Frank Redding, has not been convicted.\n A mistrial was declared in his case.\n Al Scott was a government witness at the trial.\n\n\n  If the investigators had evidence that Mr. Scott took money for\n\nhis vote, why wouldn't they have sought his indictment along with Rep.\n\nRedding?\n If they had suspected Mr. Scott, wouldn't they have gone to him and\n\ntried to trap him the same way they set up a trap for Mr. Redding?\n\n  Mr. Poythress also complained to the State Ethics Commission\n\nabout Mr. Scott, claiming the incumbent broke the rules on raising campaign\n\nmoney.\n\n\n  Ironically, Mr. Poythress is supported by the forces of former\n\nLabor Commissioner Sam Caldwell, who was forced to resign his office under a\n\ncloud of scandal and wound up spending time in jail. Mr. Poythress\n\nobviously is not as sensitive about his support as he is about Mr. Scott 's\n\nalleged conduct.\n\n  Political contests should be settled at the polls by citizens who\n\nare not confused or misled by unconfirmed rumors and charges. We deplore\n\nthis type of political attack whenever and wherever it is made.\n\n\n\n  Among those who got jolted in the Georgia primary voting was\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ben Jones, the former TV actor.\n Among those who got scared but escaped defeat was Republican Rep.\n\nNewt Gingrich.\n\n  Rep. Jones fared poorly in a Democratic race won by state\n\nlegislator Don Johnson.\n Mr. Johnson, chairman of the state Senate Appropriations Committee,\n\naccused Rep. Jones of working for perks and privileges, voting against\n\nvoluntary prayer in school, and being out of touch with voters in eastern\n\nGeorgia 's 10th District.\n\n  \" The commercials and the rumors and things like that are as\n\ntough as we've e 've faced,\" Mr. Jones complained.\n Yes, they were tough.\n But they summed up his House stint pretty well.\n\n\n  Mr. Johnson, however, is not home free.\n\n\n  Newt Gingrich, the House minority whip and Georgia 's only\n\nRepublican in Congress, edged Herman Clark, a former state legislator who\n\nridiculed Mr. Gingrich for writing bad checks, voting himself a pay raise and\n\nusing a limousine.\n In this case, the criticism was also fair because Rep. Gingrich did\n\nall those things.\n But he was not a major culprit in the House overdraft scandal, he\n\napologized for having been involved, and he voted to publicize the names of\n\nall those who had written overdrafts.\n He redeemed himself somewhat by properly supporting openness and\n\nreform of the system that brought about the scandal.\n\n\n  One of Mr. Gingrich 's prime virtues as a congressman is his\n\nability to put burrs under the saddles of the Democratic House leadership.\n For that reason, Democrats will work hard to beat him in the fall.\n But the minority whip 's abrasiveness doesn't void the fact that what\n\nhe says often needs to be said.\n\n\n\n  The days of the police six-shooters became numbered when more\n\ncriminals started packing semiautomatic pistols.\n\n\n  County police officers are being issued .45-caliber pistols,\n\nwhich hold 8-shot clips, to replace their 5- or 6-shot .38 revolvers.\n\n  It 's good that officers will be less likely to be out-gunned.\n With more sophisticated hardware on the market, those who protect\n\nand serve shouldn't be put at a disadvantage.\n\n\n  Great oratory is still missing from the presidential election\n\ncampaign.\n Most of us who like it are still smarting from President Bush 's\n\nlackluster State of the Union address in January.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ca63b446-1cd6-40c7-a395-849564d41979", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.872777+00:00"}

I was thrilled, to say the least ( considering that if they hadn't\n\nI'd've 'den 'veemployed).\n Of course, teaching an entire semester has been twenty times harder\n\nthan teaching less than four weeks' worth, but it 's also been rewarding.\n For example, I can actually develop themes over a long period of\n\ntime, where in July we just sampled them.\n Thus, this summer we talked about housing issues; slang to use when\n\nyou're r 'rentically/sexually interested in someone; welfare; stereotyping of\n\nLatinos; women and work; neighborhood safety, and a wealth of other short\n\ntopics.\n But this time around I've st 'vetured the class around forms of\n\ndiscrimination.\n Each unit has focussed on a different type: mostly we've ta 'ved\n\nabout racism, but right now we're t 'reing about sexual harassment ( as the\n\nevents in this country 's Senate make it quite a propros).\n It 's exciting to say that I can actually do this!\n And the women that I teach are wonderful, so we've 'veen able to\n\ncreate an atmosphere where they feel free to talk, and even I don't feel\n\nembarassed to bring up my own race and discuss issues that might develop from\n\nthat ( \" teacher = position of power\" stereotypes).\n I'm 'mrd-pressed to put into words all that this class means to me.\n It 's not just a useful early teaching experience or a new group of\n\nfriends.\n It 's a myriad of opportunities for growth, and I can feel that\n\ngrowth happening ( although it 's never fast enough! I get so impatient with\n\nmyself!).\n\n\n  I 'm listening to a song that always makes me think of Juan\n\nSantos, that guy who stole my heart shortly after I pieced what was left of\n\nit back together after the Vik fiasco.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b105499b-68b0-4fa3-9d55-6fd6d524f5ef", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.874007+00:00"}
{"text": "Although Rotel may not be a familiar brand name to many American\n\naudiophiles, it has long had a solid reputation in Britain for producing\n\ngood-sounding, moderate-priced equipment.\n This Japanese company has now introduced a high- end line in the\n\nUnited States; the line includes a tuner, a phono preamp and equalizer, a\n\npassive preamp, and the two products under review, the RHB-10 power amplifier\n\nand RHA- 10 preamplifier.\n The amp sells for about\n\n&dollar;2,700, and the preamp for about\n\n&dollar;1,800.\n\n  I initially approached these two components with some trepidation.\n Far too many Japanese companies' attempts at high-end amps and preamps\n\nhave emphasized features over sound quality.\n The technical excellence of such units seemed to be the product of a\n\ncommittee of engineers unsupervised by anyone who actually listens.\n The end result has been products that have outstanding specs and test\n\nperformance but that fail to provide musicality to match their technical\n\nachievements.\n The RHB-10 and RHA-10, however, combine both technical and musical\n\nexcellence.\n Rotel has produced two excellent high-end units and has a design team\n\nthat can listen!\n\n  My first indication of how good the RHB-10 power amplifier is\n\ncame from my eldest son.\n He does a great deal of my unpacking and hookup work, and has gotten\n\nused to constant changes in my electronics.\n He normally greets new amplifiers with total indifference, but when\n\nhe turned on the RHB-10, he reacted immediately by saying, \" That sounds\n\nreally good!\"\n\n  Extended listening with a wide range of speakers confirmed my\n\nson 's praise.\n The RHB-10 is rated at 200 watts into 8 ohms, 330 watts into 4 ohms,\n\nand a higher power level into 2 ohms.\n Such ratings are not uncommon for today 's transistor power\n\namplifiers, but the amps often prove disappointing in terms of driving\n\ndifficult loads and are unpredictable in terms of performance with particular\n\nspeakers.\n The RHB-10 exhibited neither of these problems.\n It performed well with my Apogee Divas, Thiel CS-5s, Quad ESL-63s,\n\nSpendor BC-1s, and a pair of custom-built small monitors that have extremely\n\ndemanding crossovers and impedance.\n\n  I experience no problems with the amp 's power- protection\n\ncircuitry, even when committing the usual round of \" stupid reviewer tricks\"\n\nduring various hook-ups.\n On the other hand, internal wiring changes allow you to bypass this\n\nprotection if you are a purist who demands the minimum circuitry possible\n\nbetween amplifier and speakers.\n\n  The RHB-10 is superbly built, and its styling is more typical of\n\nEuropean components than it is of Japanese.\n If you open the chassis, you find two mono amplifiers with large\n\nindividual toroidal power amplifiers.\n Each channel has a very sophisticated and highly regulated power\n\nsupply, and the gain stages are laid out in a symmetrical design, with a\n\nfully complementary push-pull differential amplifier that feeds two\n\nemitter-followers stages.\n The output stages use a Darlington quadruple parallel circuit that is\n\nalso completely symmetrical and is mirrored top, bottom, left, and right.\n The RHB-10 has exceptionally large heat-sinks, a clean circuit\n\nlayout, and excellent standards of construction.\n Rotel has used high-quality passive components, such as 1% Visha%\n\nresistors, LCR/Wima capacitors, and high purity copper wiring.\n\n  Most important, the Rotel RHB-10 is musical.\n It has an overall timbre that is just slightly warm, where most\n\nJapanese electronics tend to be just a bit lean or analytic.\n It neither rolls off the highs nor exaggerates the lower midrange and\n\nupper bass at the expense of bass depth, control, or power.\n\n  The RHB-10 is not an \" ultimate\" amp in the sense of a Classe\n\nAudio M 1000 or Krell MLA-300.\n It cannot deliver the same kind of deep bass extension and dynamics,\n\nbut its bass is very good indeed.\n Music that often seems slightly dead in the bass and lower midrange\n\nwith mid-fi or moderate-quality high-end power amplifiers, such as strong\n\nbass lines in jazz and rock, comes alive with the Rotel.\n At the same time, percussion does not lose detail, and guitar is not\n\naltered in overall timbre.\n\n  The midrange is exceptionally sweet and does not lose detail or\n\ntransparency.\n Many Japanese-made high-end amplifiers have excellent signal-to-noise\n\nspecifications and performance but limited midrange transparency and life.\n With the RHB-10, you can really enjoy low-level midrange detail and\n\nlisten to voice without fear of hearing a change in character or of having\n\nvoice go hard or flat.\n Many transistor amplifiers are a bit unkind to female vocalists,\n\nparticularly untrained soprano voices.\n The Rotel will not compensate for vocal weaknesses, but it has the\n\nkind of midrange that allows you to get the best out of solo voice.\n The same is true of demanding instruments like the violin and\n\nharpsichord.\n\n  The upper midrange and treble are equally well defined; no one\n\nwill ever accuse the RHB-10 of lacking highs.\n It offers transparency and low-level definition without an apparent\n\nbrightness or edge.\n One of the most critical tests of a power amplifier is whether it\n\nprovides exceptional upper midrange detail and the ability to resolve upper\n\nmidrange harmonics, low-level detail, and transients in a way that is as\n\nmusically natural as the source material and front-end components allow.\n The upper midrange and treble of the Rotel RHB-10, though just a bit\n\nshort of reference quality, are outstanding for an amplifier in its price\n\nrange.\n\n  The soundstage performance of the RHB-10 is equally good.\n The amp reproduces virtually all of the soundstage information on a\n\nrecording without contracting it, expanding it, or altering its apparent\n\nlocation in space.\n ( I have several DAT cassettes of solo instruments that I recorded\n\nlive.\n I keep notes with these tapes on the location, apparent size, and\n\nsound character of the guitar, drum set, and piano I recorded.)\n The RHB-10 does an excellent job of handling image size, some very\n\nlow-level soundstage data, and left-to-right placement.\n It also does very well in reproducing layers of depth with more\n\ncomplicated music--although I am highly leery of saying that the depth of\n\norchestral or any other complicated music is ever captured naturally on a\n\nrecording and that it can ever be reproduced accurately in a home listening\n\nroom.\n\n  The Rotel is scarcely unique in being mechanically and\n\nelectronically quiet.\n In fact, I would deem unreviewable, and instantly return, any\n\nhigh-end transistor power amplifier that had fan noise, mechanical hum, or\n\nany electronic noise or hum that was audible in the listening position.\n There are so many top-quality amps without such defects that even\n\nminimal noise is totally unacceptable!\n The RHB-10, however, does deserve high praise for being remarkably\n\nfree of the kind of low-level noise that nags at the edges of your\n\nperception.\n You can listen further into the music than is common with amplifiers\n\nin its price range.\n\n  My single reservation about the RHB-10 concerns its ergonomics\n\nand is a bit petty.\n The WBT output terminals for speaker connections do an excellent job\n\nof accommodating large bare wires, but they will not fit the standard spade\n\nlugs used by many high-end speaker cable manufacturers in the U.S.\n On the other hand, Rotel does recommend its own \" 6 nines\" copper\n\nspeaker cable.\n This cable is not a rival of the best American cables ( such as\n\nproducts from AudioQuest, OCOS, Kimber, Tara Labs, and Wireworld), but it is\n\nof very high quality.\n\n  If I have slightly less praise for the RHA-10 preamp, it is not\n\nbecause it, too, is not an excellent- sounding unit.\n Like the RHB-10, it is superbly built, uses high-quality and\n\ncustom-designed components, and has a very attractive European styling.\n This is the kind of unit that you want to display rather than hide in\n\na cabinet.\n\n  The RHA-10 also reflects Rotel 's emphasis on actually listening,\n\nrather than taking sound for granted as many mid-fi designers do.\n The preamp uses a specially designed four-gang attenuator as a volume\n\ncontrol, Vishay resistors, high-precision switches with gold-plated contacts,\n\nand a power supply with a very high-quality toroidal transformer.\n Circuitry is on a double-sided, high-grade glass-fiber board, with\n\nspecially formulated extra-thick copper tracks on the bottom and copper\n\nshielding on the top.\n If the extra care taken on this circuit board design seems like\n\ngilding the lily, let me note that every high-end electronics designer I know\n\nhas found that different types of circuit board really do have a significant\n\nimpact on the nuances of sound quality.\n\n  The circuitry is similar to the symmetrical, push-pull topology\n\nused in the rest of the new Rotel line.\n Rotel feels that it contributes to the preservation of subtle phase\n\ndifferences between the two channels and that it presents a highly detailed\n\nsoundstage with a great deal of depth.\n\n  Features include low-impedance outputs that allow very long\n\ninterconnects, three regular line-level inputs, and two tape loops.\n A tape buffer amplifier is intended to eliminate any possibility that\n\nhookup to a tape unit will degrade the signal to the power amplifier, and\n\nthere is a record output switch with five positions plus a separate control\n\nfor switching the tape output off.\n All of the inputs are mechanically switched, and an input is only\n\nconnected to the ground plane when it is active.\n This feature may seem unimportant, but it is surprising how many\n\nhigh-end preamps allow trace levels of signal to go from one input to\n\nanother--particularly when a tape monitor output is being fed into the\n\npreamp.\n\n\n  These features are typical of today 's \" minimalist\" high-end\n\npreamps, where the goal is the lest possible coloration of the signal.\n At the same time, I do have three minor reservations about the\n\nfeatures of the RHA-10:\n\n  * There are no balanced inputs or outputs.\n This will be unimportant when the RHA-10 is used with the RHB-10 or\n\nin an installation free of hum fields and other sources of noise.\n Most of today 's top preamps do, however, have at least one balanced\n\ninput and one balanced output.\n\n  * It may make sense for a manufacturer to assign numbers to the\n\ninputs on a unit intended to be exported, rather than assigning them names,\n\nbut I find names more convenient.\n\n  * The RHA-10 does have a remote control that can also be used\n\nwith the Rotel RHT-10 turner, but the remote does not have a balance control.\n I find the ability to adjust balance via a remote control to be a\n\nreal advantage.\n I have a great many CDs and records where a slight adjustment of\n\nbalance is needed to lock in left-to-right imaging and depth.\n Perhaps if a balance control was called a soundstage control, its\n\nimportance might receive more widespread recognition.\n\n  What counts most in a high-end product, however, is sound\n\nquality, and the RHA-10 is very competitive with other preamps in its price\n\nrange.\n Its sound largely duplicates the sound of the RHB-10.\n It is very neutral in overall timbre and frequency response, with no\n\ntouch of transistor leanness.\n It does not alter the highs or bass to reduce or emphasize either\n\nfrequency extreme.\n\n  Bass extension and dynamics are fully competitive with the better\n\nhigh-end U.S.\n designs, with a high-quality deep bass that is missing in many\n\nimported preamps.\n Percussion and string bass have excellent transient and harmonic\n\ndetail.\n\n  The midrange is neutral and transparent, although a few U.S.-made\n\nhigh-end line preamps provide slightly more low-level and transient detail.\n Reproduction of voice and solo instruments is excellent, particularly\n\nviolin, piano, and guitar.\n Resolution of complex choral passages and grand opera is very good to\n\nexcellent, and very musical.\n\n  The upper midrange and treble are largely unaffected by the\n\nRHA-10 preamp, with the same transparency, low-level definition, and lack of\n\napparent brightness or edge as the RHB-10 amp.\n The sound of the upper octaves is determined far more by the other\n\nactive and passive components in the system than by the RHA-10, although\n\nthere is a minor loss of sweetness and harmonic detail compared to the upper\n\noctaves of the best high-end designs.\n\n  The soundstage performance of the RHA-10 is very good to\n\nexcellent--even in comparison with the top high-end units.\n Soundstage width and depth are very natural, as is the presentation\n\nof left-to-right imaging and layers of depth.\n Some other units do a slightly better job of reproducing very\n\nlow-level soundstage detail and musical dynamics, and the RHA-10 does tend to\n\nmove the apparent listening position just slightly forward.\n At the same time, the RHA-10 matches the RHB-10 in providing an\n\nexceptional apparent signal-to-noise ratio and in being electronically\n\nquiet.\n\n  In broad terms, the RHA-10 provides excellent sound quality and\n\nhighly musical performance.\n It is a fact of life, however, that any line-stage preamplifier\n\ncosting over\n\n&dollar;1,000 that does not provide excellent sound quality will simply not be\n\ncompetitive in today 's market.\n The state of the art has advanced to the point where a colored or\n\nnoisy unit is more an irritating curiosity than a serious product--except for\n\nthose audiophiles who want a

{"text": "Assembly language isn't the be-all and end-all of PC programming,\n\nbut as Michael states, it 's sometimes the only game in town when performance\n\nor program size are important.\n\n  Michael works on high-performance graphics software at\n\nMetagraphics in Scotts Valley, Calif. He is also the author of Zen of\n\nAssembly Language published by Scott, Foresman & Co., and Power Graphics\n\nProgramming, from Que.\n\n  There 's an old joke that goes something like this: Person\n#1: Help!\n My brother thinks he 's a chicken, and I don't know what I should\n\ndo.

Manager\n#2: Have you told them the truth?\n Manager\n#1: I would, but I need the speed.\n\n  Assembly language beats everything else hands down when it comes\n\nto performance-- especially when programming for the 80x86, where assembly\n\nlanguage is wild, woolly, and wondrous - - yet it gets no respect. When\n\nyou flat-out need performance, there simply are no substitutes for assembly\n\nlanguage - - so why doesn't anyone seem to love it? \n\n\n  Experts, pundits, and management types have been beating the\n\ndrums for the demise of assembly language for years. There are many good\n\nreasons for wishing it dead. Compared to compiled code, good\n\nassembly-language code is harder to write, is more bug prone, takes more time\n\nto create, is harder to maintain, is harder to port to other platforms, and\n\nis more difficult to use for complex, multiprogrammer projects. That makes\n\nassembly language an expensive, demanding, and time-consuming development\n\nlanguage. Given the realities of time to market, the relative costs of\n\ngood assembly language and high-level language programmers, programmer\n\nturnover, and ever-increasing software complexity, it 's neither surprising\n\nnor unreasonable that most of the industry wishes assembly language would go\n\naway.\n\n  Assembly language lives, though, for one simple reason: Properly\n\napplied, it produces the best code of any language.\n\n\n  Don't believe me?\n If the carbon-based computer between your ears were\n\nprogrammed with as good a compiler as Microsoft 's, then you'd generate much\n\nbetter code in assembly l 'dguage than does Microsoft C, because you know\n\nvastly more about what you want your program to do and are marvelously\n\neffective at integrating that knowledge into a working whole. High-level\n\nlanguages are artificially constrained programming environments, able to pass\n\nrelatively little of what you know along to the ultimate machine code.\n\nThere are good reasons for that: High-level languages have to be compilable\n\nand comprehensible by humans. Nonetheless, there 's no way for a high-level\n\nlanguage to know where to focus its efforts, or which way to bias code.\n\n  For example, how can a Pascal compiler know that one loop repeats\n\ntwice, on average, while another repeats 32,767 times?\n How can a C compiler know that one subroutine is time critical,\n\ndeserving of all possible optimization, while another subroutine executes in\n\nthe background while waiting for the next key to be pressed, so speed matters\n\nnot at all?\n ( Actually,\n#pragma can do a little of that, but it 's no more than a tiny step in the\n\nright direction.) \n\n  Just as significantly, no compiler can globally organize your\n\ndata structures and the code that manipulates those structures to maximum\n\nadvantage, nor take advantage of the vast number of potential optimizations\n\nas flexibly as you can. ( Space forbids even a partial listing of\n\noptimization techniques for the 80x86 family: The list is astonishingly long\n\nand varied. See Tim Paterson 's article in this issue for a small but\n\npotent sample.) When it comes to integrating all the information about a\n\nparticular aspect of a program and implementing the code as efficiently as\n\npossible given the capabilities of a particular processor, it 's not even\n\nclose: Humans are much better optimizers than compilers are.\n\n  Almost any processor can benefit from hand-tuned assembly\n\nlanguage, but assembly language lives most vibrantly in the 80x86 family.\n\nThe 80x86 instruction set is irregular; the register set is small, with most\n\nregisters dedicated to specific purposes; segments complicate everything; and\n\nthe prefetching nature of the 80x86 renders actual execution time\n\nnon-quantifiable - - and optimization at best an art and at worst black magic\n\n- - making the 80x86 family a nightmare for optimizing-compiler writers.\n\nThe quirky ( and highly assembly language amenable) instructions of the 8086\n\nlive on in the latest 80x86-family processors, the 80386 and 80486, and will\n\nundoubtedly do the same for many generations to come. Other processors may\n\nlend themselves better to compilers, but the 80x86 family is and always will\n\nbe a wonderland for assembly language.\n\n  Consider this: Well-written assembly language provides a 50 to\n\n300 percent boost in performance over compiled code ( more sometimes, less\n\nothers, but that 's a conservative range). An 8-MHz AT is about three times\n\nfaster than a PC, a 16-MHz 80386 machine is about twice as fast as an AT, and\n\na 25-MHz 80386 is about three times as fast as an AT. There are a lot of\n\nPCs and ATs out there - - 20 to 30 million, I'd guess - - and there is a\n\nhorde of 'ders contemplating the expenditure of thousands of dollars to\n\nupgrade.\n\n  Those users don't have to upgrade - - they\n\njust need to buy better-written software. The performance boost good\n\nassembly language provides is about the same as stepping up to the next\n\nhardware platform, but the assembly language route is one heck of a lot\n\ncheaper.\n\n  In other words, better software can eliminate the need for\n\nexpensive hardware, giving the developer the opportunity to realize a healthy\n\nprofit for his extra development efforts. Just as important is the fact\n\nthat good assembly language runs perfectly well on slower computers, making\n\nthe market for such software considerably larger than the market for average\n\nsoftware. If you make your software snappy on an 8088, your potential\n\nmarket doubles instantly and the competition thins.\n\n  Finally, it 's on the slower computers - - the PC and AT - - that\n\nassembly language optimization has the most effect ( see the example later in\n\nthis article), and that 's precisely where improved performance is most\n\nneeded.\n\n\n  What of it?\n If high-level languages make it easier and faster to create programs,\n\nwho cares if those programs are slower? \n\n  Users care about perceived performance -\n\n- how well a program seems to run. Perceived performance includes lack of\n\nbugs, ease of use, and, right at the top of the list, responsiveness. Hand\n\nusers a whizbang program that makes them wait at frequent intervals, and\n\nthey'll leave it on the shelf after trying 'llonce. Give users a program\n\nthat never gets in their way, and they may love it without ever knowing quite\n\nwhy. In these days of all-too-sluggish graphical interfaces, the\n\nperformance issue is central to the usability of almost every program.\n\n  Do you\n\ncare how your car was designed?\n You care that it 's safe, that it 's reliable, and that it performs\n\nadequately, but you certainly don't care whether the manufacturer used\n\njust-in-time manufacturing, or whether mainframe or micro-computer CAD was\n\nused in the design process. Likewise, users don't care whether a\n\nprogrammer used OOP or C or Pascal, or COBOL, for that matter; they care that\n\na program does what they need and performs responsively. That 's not purely\n\na matter of speed, but without speed the user will never be fully\n\nsatisfied.\n\n\n  When you need it, there 's no substitute for assembly language,\n\nbut it can be a drag when you don't need it - - so know when to use it.\n\nHumans are better large-scale designers and small-scale optimizers than\n\ncompilers, but they're not very good at the grunt work 'recompiling, such as\n\nsetting up stack frames, handling 32-bit values, allocating and accessing\n\nautomatic variables, and the like. Moreover, humans are much slower at\n\ngenerating code, so it 's a good idea to avoid being a \" human compiler.\"\n Some people create complex macros and assembly language programming\n\nconventions and do all their programming in assembly language. That works\n\n- - but what those macros and conventions do is make assembly language\n\nfunction much like a high-level language, so there 's no great benefit,\n\nespecially given that you can drop into assembly language from a high-level\n\nlanguage at any time just by calling an assembly language subroutine ( or,\n\nbetter yet, by using in-line assembly language in a compiler that offers that\n\nfeature, such as Turbo C). Unless you're a masochist, let your favorite 're\ncompiler do what it 's best at - - compiling - - and save assembly language\n\nfor those small, well-defined portions of your software where your efforts\n\nand unique skills pay off handsomely.\n\n  A relevant point is that assembly language alone is not the path\n\nto performance. If you have a program that takes as long as a second to\n\nupdate the screen, you have problems that assembly language alone won't\n\nsolve: Proper overall design and algorithm selection are also essential.\n\nHowever, most software designers consider the job done when the design and\n\nalgorithm phases are complete, leaving the low-level optimization to the\n\ncompiler. I repeat: No compiler can match a good assembly language\n\nprogrammer at low-level optimization. Given the irregular nature of the\n\n80x86 family and the huge PC software market, it 's well worth the time\n\nrequired to hand-optimize the few critical portions that control perceived\n\nperformance. Only in assembly language can you take full responsibility\n\nfor the performance of your code.\n\n\n  While I can't offer a cut-and-dried dictum on when to use\n\nassembly language, the practice of using it when the user would notice if you\n\ndidn't is a good rule of thumb. While some programmers would take this\n\nrule too far and use assembly language too often, the vast majority of\n\nprogrammers will lean over backwards the other way, in the face of all\n\nevidence to the contrary. Hal Hardenberg 's late, lamented DTACK Grounded\n\nreveled in the folly of the AT&T programmers who implemented the\n\nfloating-point routines for a super-micro in C rather than assembly language\n\n- - with the result that the computer performed floating-point arithmetic not\n\nquite so fast as a Commodore VIC-20!\n\n\n  Likewise, I once wrote an article in which I measured the\n\nperformance of an assembly-language line-drawing implementation at four to\n\nfive times that of an equivalent C implementation. One reader rewrote the\n\nC code for greater efficiency, ran it through Microsoft C rather than Turbo\n\nC, and wrote to inform me that I had shortchanged C; assembly language was\n\nactually \" only\" 70 percent faster than C. As it happens, the\n\nassembly-language code wasn't fully optimized, but that 's not the important\n\npoint: What really matters is that when programmers go out of their way to\n\nproduce code that 's nearly twice as slow ( and in an important user-interface\n\ncomponent, no less) in order to use a high-level language rather than\n\nassembly language, it 's the user who 's getting shortchanged. Commercial\n\ndevelopers in particular can't afford to ignore this, and I suspect that most\n\nsuch developers are DDJ readers. If you're aiming to sell hundreds 're\n\nthousands of copies of a program, you're guaranteed to have stif 're\ncompetition. If you don't go the extra mile to provide snappy response,\n\nsomeone else will - - and you'll be left out in the col 'll/p>\n\n  On the other hand, assembly language code is harder and slower to\n\nwrite, and pays off only in the few most critical portions of any program.\n\nThere are limits to the levels of complexity humans can handle in assembly\n\nlanguage, and limits to the development time that can be taken before a\n\nproduct must come to market. Identify the parts of your programs that\n\nsignificantly affect the performance perceived by the user ( a code profiler\n\ncan help greatly here), and focus your efforts on that code, with especially\n\nclose attention to oft-repeated loops.\n\n  The week the last Internet porn scandal broke, my phone didn't\n\nstop ringing: ?\n Are women comfortable on the Net??\n ? Should women use gender-neutral names on the Net??\n ? Are women harassed on the Net??\n Reporters called from all over the country with basically the same\n\nquestion.\n I told them all: your question is ill-formed.\n ? The Net?\n is not one thing.\n It 's like asking: ? Are women comfortable in bars??\n That 's a silly question.\n Which woman?\n\n\n  The summer I was 18, I was the computer counselor at a summer\n\ncamp.\n After the campers were asleep, the counselors were allowed out, and\n\nwould go bar hopping.\n First everyone would go to Maria 's, an Italian restaurant with\n\nred-and- white-checked table cloths.\n Maria welcomed everyone from behind the bar, greeting regular\n\ncustomers by name.\n She always brought us free garlic bread.\n Next we'd go to the Sandpipe 'd a disco with good dance music.\n The Sandpiper seemed excitingly adult--it was a little scary at\n\nfirst, but then I loved it.\n Next, we went to the Sportsman, a leather motorcycle bar that I found\n\nabsolutely terrifying.\n Huge, bearded men bulging out of their leather vests and pants leered\n\nat me.\n I hid in the corner and tried not to make eye contact with anyone,\n\nhoping my friends would get tired soon and give me a ride back to camp. \n\n  Each of these bars was a community, and some were more\n\ncomfortable for me than others.\n The Net is made up of hundreds of thousands of separate communities,\n\neach with its own special character.\n Not only is the Net a diverse place, but ? women? are diverse as\n\nwell--there were leather-clad women who loved the Sportsman, and plenty of\n\nwomen revel in the fiery rhetoric of Usenet 's alt.flame.\n When people complain about being harassed on the Net, they've usually\n\nstumbled in 'vethe wrong online community.\n The question is not whether ? women? are comfortable on ? the Net,?\n\nbut rather what types of communities are possible? How can we create a range\n\nof communities so that everyone--men and women--can find a place that is\n\ncomfortable for them? \n\n  If you're looking for a res 'rerant or bar, you can often tell\n\nwithout even going in: Is the sign flashing neon or engraved wood?\n Are there lots of cars parked out front?\n What sort of cars? ( You can see all the Harleys in front of the\n\nSportsman from a block away.)\n Look in the window: How are people dressed?\n We are accustomed to diversity in restaurants.\n People know that not all restaurants will please them, and employ a\n\nvariety of techniques to choose the right one. \n\n  It 's a lot harder to find a good virtual community than it is to\n\nfind a good bar.\n The visual cues that let you spot the difference between Maria 's and\n\nthe Sportsman from across the street are largely missing.\n Instead, you have to ? lurk?- enter the community and quietly explore\n\nfor a while, getting the feel of whether it 's the kind of place you're\n\nlooking for 're Although published guides exist, they're not always ver 'reseful--most\n\ncontain encyclopedic lists with little commentary or critical evaluation, and\n\nby the time they're published they 're already out of 'rete.\n Magazines like NetGuide and Wired are more current and more\n\nselective, and therefore more useful, but their editorial bias may not fit\n\nwith your personal tastes. \n\n  Commonly available network-searching tools are also useful.\n The World Wide Web is filled with searching programs, indexes, and\n\neven indexes of indexes ( ? meta-indexes?).\n Although browsing with these tools can be a pleasant diversion, it is\n\nnot very efficient, and searches for particular pieces of information often\n\nend in frustration.\n If you keep an open mind, however, you may come across something\n\ngood. \n\n\n  But what happens if, after exploring and asking around, you still\n\ncan't find an online environment that suits you?\n Don't give up: start your own!\n This doesn't have to be a difficult task.\n Anyone can create a new newsgroup in Usenet 's ? alt? hierarchy or\n\nopen a new chat room on America Online.\n Users of Unix systems can easily start a mailing list.\n If you have a good idea but not enough technical skill or the right\n\ntype of Net access, there are people around eager to help.\n The more interesting question is: How do you help a community to\n\nbecome what you hope for? Here, I can offer some hard-won advice. \n\n  In my research at the MIT Media Lab ( working with Professor\n\nMitchel Resnick), I design virtual communities.\n In October of 1992, I founded a professional community for media\n\nresearchers on the Internet called MediaMOO.\n Over the past three years, as MediaMOO has grown to 1,000 members\n\nfrom 33 countries, I have grappled with many of the issues that face anyone\n\nattempting to establish a virtual community.\n MediaMOO is a ? multi-user dungeon? or MUD--a virtual world on the\n\nInternet with rooms, objects, and people from all around the world.\n Messages typed in by a user instantly appear on the screens of all\n\nother users who are currently in the same virtual ? room.?\n This real-time interaction distinguishes MUDs from Usenet newsgroups,\n\nwhere users can browse through messages created many hours or days before.\n The MUD 's virtual world is built in text descriptions.\n MOO stands for MUD object-oriented, a kind of MUD software ( created\n\nby Pavel Curtis of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and Stephen White, now\n\nat InContext Systems) that allows each user to write programs to define\n\nspaces and objects. \n\n  The first MUDS, developed in the late 1970s, were multiplayer\n\nfantasy games of the dungeons-and-dragons variety.\n In 1989, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University named James\n\nAspnes decided to see what would happen if you took away the monsters and the\n\nmagic swords but instead let people extend the virtual world.\n People 's main activity went from trying to conquer the virtual world\n\nto trying to build it, collaboratively. \n\n  Most MUDs are populated by undergraduates who should be doing\n\ntheir homework.\n I thought it would be interesting instead to bring together a group\n\nof people with a shared intellectual interest: the study of media.\n Ideally, MediaMOO should be like an endless reception for a\n\nconference on media studies.\n But given the origin of MUDs as violent games, giving one an\n\nintellectual and professional atmosphere was a tall order.\n How do you guide the evolution of who uses the space and what they\n\ndo there? \n\n  A founder/designer can't control what the community ultimately\n\nbecomes--much of that is up to the users--but can help shape it.\n The personality of the community 's founder can have a great\n\ninfluence on what sort of place it becomes.\n Part of what made Maria 's so comfortable for me was Maria herself.\n\n\n  Similarly, one of the most female-friendly electronic\n\ncommunities I've visited i 'veew York City 's ECHO ( East Coast Hang Out)\n\nbulletin board, run by Stacy Horn.\n Smart, stylish, and deliberately outrageous, Horn is role model and\n\npatron saint for the ECHO-ites.\n Her outspoken but sensitive personality infuses the community, and\n\nsends a message to women that it 's all right to speak up.\n She added a conference to ECHO called ?\n WIT?\n ( women in telecommunications), which one user describes as ?\n a warm, supportive, women-only, private conference where women 's\n\nthoughts, experiences, wisdom, joys, and despairs are shared.?\n But Horn also added a conference called ? BITCH,? which the ECHO-ite\n\ncalls ? WIT in black leather jackets.\n\n\n  Horn 's high-energy, very New York brand of intelligence\n\nestablishes the kind of place ECHO is and influences how everyone there\n\nbehaves.\n When ECHO was first established, Horn and a small group of her close\n\nfriends were the most active people on the system.\n ? That set the emotional tone, the traditional style of posting, the\n\nunwritten rules about what it 's OK to say,?\n says Marisa Bowe, an ECHO administrator for many years.\n ? Even though Stacy is too busy these days to post very much, the\n\ntone established in the early days continues,? says Bowe, who is now editor\n\nof an online magazine called Word. \n\n  Beyond the sheer force of a founder 's personality, a community\n\nestablishes a particular character with a variety of choices on how to\n\noperate.\n One example is to set a policy on whether to allow participants to\n\nremain anonymous.\n Initially, I decided that members of MediaMOO should be allowed to\n\nchoose: they could identify themselves with their real names and e-mail\n\naddresses, or remain anonymous.\n Others questioned whether there was a role for anonymity in a\n\nprofessional community. \n\n  As time went on, I realized they were right.\n People on MediaMOO are supposed to be networking, hoping someone\n\nwill look up who they really are and where they work.\n Members who are not wi11ng to share their personal and professional\n\nidentities are less likely to engage in serious discussion about their work\n\nand consequently about media in general.\n Furthermore, comments from an anonymous entity are less valuable\n\nbecause they are unsituated-- ? I believe X? is less meaningful to a listener\n\nthan ? I am a librarian with eight years of experience who lives in a small\n\ntown in Georgia, and I believe X.?\n In theory, anonymous participants could describe their professional\n\nexperiences and place their comments in that context; in practice it tends\n\nnot to happen that way.\n After six months, I proposed that we change the policy to require\n\nthat all new members be identified.\n Despite the protests of a few vocal opponents, most people thought\n\nthat this was a good idea, and the change was made. \n\n  Each community needs to have its own policy on anonymity.\n There 's room for diversity here too: some communities can be\n\nall-anonymous, some all-identified, and some can leave that decision up to\n\neach individual.\n An aside: right now on the Net no one is either really anonymous or\n\nreally identified.\n It is easy to fake an identity; it is also possible to use either\n\ntechnical or legal tools to peer behind someone else 's veil of anonymity.\n This ambiguous state of affairs is not necessarily unfortunate: it 's\n\nnice to know that a fake identity that provides a modicum of privacy is easy\n\nto construct, but that in extreme cases such people can be tracked down. \n\n\n  Another important design decision is admissions policy.\n Most places on the Net have a strong pluralistic flavor, and the\n\nidea that some people might be excluded from a community ruffles a lot of\n\nfeathers.\n But exclusivity is a fact of life.\n MIT wouldn't be MIT if everyone who wanted to come was admitted.\n Imagine if companies had to give jobs to everyone who applied!\n Virtual communities, social clubs, universities, and corporations\n\nare all groups of people brought together for a purpose.\n Achieving that purpose often requires that there be some way to\n\ndetermine who can join the community. \n\n  A key decision I made for MediaMOO was to allow entry only to\n\npeople doing some sort of ? media research.?\n I try to be loose on the definition of ? media?--writing teachers,\n\ncomputer network administrators, and librarians are all working with forms of\n\nmedia--but strict on the definition of ? research.?\n At first, this policy made me uncomfortable.\n I would nervously tell people, ? It 's mostly a self-selection\n\nprocess.\n We hardly reject anyone at all!?\n Over time, I've 'vecome more comfortable with this restriction, and\n\nhave enforced the requirements more stringently.\n\n\n  Even if an online community decides to admit all comers, it does\n\nnot have to let all contributors say anything they want.\n The existence of a moderator to filter postings often makes for more\n\nfocused and civil discussion.\n Consider Usenet 's two principal newsgroups dealing with feminism-\n\nalt.feminism and soc.feminism.\n In alt.feminism, anyone can post whatever they want.\n Messages in this group are filled with the angry words of angry\n\npeople; more insults than ideas are exchanged.\n ( Titles of messages found there on a randomly selected day included ?\n\nWomen & the workplace ( it doesn't work)? and ? What is a feminazi??.)\n The topic may nominally be feminism, but the discussion itself is\n\nnot feminist in nature. \n\n  The huge volume of postings ( more than 200 per day, on average)\n\nshows that many people enjoy writing such tirades.\n But if I wanted to discuss some aspect of feminism, alt.feminism\n\nwould be the last place I' 'dgo.\n Its sister group, soc.feminism, is moderated--volunteers read\n\nmessages submitted to the group and post only those that pass muster.\n Moderators adhere to soc.feminism 's lengthy charter, which explains\n\nthe criteria for acceptable postings--forbidding ad hominem attacks, for\n\ninstance.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "817591d4-2003-4f7a-b3c0-8d6a25b4bfcc", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.876570+00:00"}

Day Saints hall in Kailua - Kona to review the proposal\n\nbefore casting their votes.\n\n  HSTA and state officials announced the end of the strike, which\n\nresulted in 14 days of lost educational instruction, late Monday.\n The strike ended just hours before a federal judge could have\n\nintervened and appointed a receiver to take over the school system. \n\n  Teachers are expected to return to school this morning, with\n\nclasses slated to resume Thursday. \n\n  Reaction to the contract agreement was mixed and many teachers\n\nleaving the hall refrained from answering questions, while others refused to\n\nprovide their names. \n\n  \" I voted to ratify it,\" said one teacher who asked to remain\n\nanonymous.\n \" I think if we didn't the public would tear our throats out.\n But I feel bad for the senior teachers, they got shortchanged again.\n\n\n  Several teachers noted the contract did not include provisions\n\nfor retroactive pay.\n\n  \" It ( the state 's offer) is fair,\" said Brian Boshard, Kealakehe\n\nIntermediate School teacher.\n However, he added, the lack of retroactive salary is obviously not\n\nwhat the teachers wanted.\n\n  \" I voted my heart,\" Boshard said.\n \" I'm a public 'mhool teacher.\n I would be working without a raise anyway - it 's my calling.\n\n\n  During a nearly two - hour discussion prior to the vote, HSTA\n\nKona Chapter President Bob Hurley fielded questions and reviewed salary\n\nschedules. \n\n  \" I don't think teachers felt pressured about anything,\" he said.\n \" They just had to figure out what was their personal choice given\n\nthe reality.\"\n\n  Hurley said it was difficult to determine how the majority felt,\n\nbut noted many expressed anger regarding the lack of retroactive pay.\n\n  \" It was a disappointment because ( Cayetano) would not negotiate\n\nany retroactive pay,\" Hurley said.\n \" He refused to budge.\n He didn't pay anyone over a two - year period and then we couldn't\n\nnegotiate that.\"\n\n \n\n  \" My feeling is it 's an ethical issue.\n We've got 'vehing added for cost of living for the past two years,\"\n\none teacher who asked to remain anonymous said.\n\n  Hurley said many teachers already have plans to leave Hawaii for\n\nemployment opportunities elsewhere, regardless of the vote results. \n\n  \" If it is approved, teachers will have a salary schedule that\n\nfunctions like step increases,\" Hurley said.\n \" It does a great deal to keep teachers we currently have - but for a\n\nlot of people, it was too little, too late - and a lot of teachers on the\n\npicket lines are ready to leave.\"\n\n  Hurley said officials estimate 1,400 new teachers will be needed\n\nnext academic year, as well as additional staff to replace those leaving.\n He noted 200 teaching positions statewide were unfilled this\n\nyear.\n\n  By striking, many teachers expected an offer that could put an\n\nend to future contract disputes.\n However, Hurley and other HSTA members said this offer does not\n\neliminate the possibility of future strikes. \n\n  \" I went on strike to ensure we would never have to go on strike\n\nagain, but I don't think it 's that way,\" an anonymous teacher said.  \n\n\n\n\n  A mixture of smiles and tears - a celebration for survivors and a\n\ntime to remember those who've pas 've on - filled the damp air with the warmth\n\nof ohana.\n\n  At the 7th annual American Cancer Society Relay for Life 2001 at\n\nOld Kona Airport field Saturday night, strangers became family through the\n\ncommon bond of cancer touching their lives - and no one went untouched.\n\n  Lifting up his shirt as his smile becomes a frown, 3 - year - old\n\nJordan Wills, points to his catheter in his tiny chest.\n\n  \" Jordan was diagnosed with leukemia in January,\" his father,\n\nJohn said.\n The medicine from chemotherapy is injected into the catheter because\n\nhis small body wouldn't take the poking of needles, John said.\n\n  Jordan kept having fevers every other day, his mother, Eleu said,\n\nand they took him to get his blood checked.\n\n  When the doctor diagnosed their son, John said his immediate\n\nthought was of the worst.\n\n  \" When you hear the word cancer you think of death,\" he said.\n\n\n\n \n\n  \" We have to for him,\" Eleu said, adding she and her husband have\n\ncrying moments when they are alone together.\n\n  The family stays positive because Jordan is part of a nation wide\n\nstudy and the cure for leukemia has gone up over the years from a 40 percent\n\ncure to a 95 percent cure, Eleu said.\n\n  \" He 's a fighter,\" John said, noting there are days when Jordan\n\ngets tired of the chemotherapy treatments.\n One of the several medications Jordan takes also affects his\n\nemotions.\n\n  \" It 's like night and day,\" John said.\n \" He'll 'llhis happy self and once he takes the medicine he 's crying\n\nand screaming.\"\n\n  Cancer survivor, Mary Huebner, puts her \" cancer survivor\" button\n\non her hand painted shirt with a rainbow leading to the pot of gold for a\n\ncure.\n\n  Huebner was diagnosed in 1997 with kidney and breast cancer and\n\nhas lived her life to the fullest for the last four years with no\n\nreoccurrence.\n\n  \" Your first thought is 'this is a death sentence,'\" she said\n\nwith tears welling up.\n \" Then you think it 's over and tell yourself, 'I don't want to die,'\n\nand you figure out what to do about it.\n\n  \" I had way too much to live for and I fought it all the way down\n\nthe line.\"\n\n  She said she learned you can't put off doing the things you want\n\nto do and now makes time to do those things.\n She makes time to spend with her children, grandchildren and 90 -\n\nyear - old mother. \n\n  \" My family rallied around me,\" she said, noting every time she\n\nwoke up in intensive care, someone was in the room.\n\n  The physical side of radiation and surgery were hard on her,\n\nHuebner said.\n\n  During her kidney operation, which had a low probability of\n\nsurvival, doctors removed one and a half of her kidneys.\n After two months when she could finally role over, Huebner endured\n\nfive months of radiation for her breast cancer following a biopsy, lumpectomy\n\nand removal of her lymph nodes. Financially, Huebner 's cancer took its toll\n\non her.\n She said her insurance couldn't cover everything and she was out of\n\nwork for eight months recovering from surgery and radiation.\n\n  The relay also touches people who don't personally have cancer.\n\n\n\n  Lucy Pasco volunteers for the American Cancer Society and with\n\nher husband, Jerry, has coordinated the Relay for Life in Kapaau for the last\n\nfour years in memory of her sister who died from stomach cancer.\n\n  \" It was hard,\" she said as she excused herself for a minute to\n\nfight the tears.\n \" It was hard to see her go through it and not understand why the\n\ndoctor 's couldn't help her.\"\n\n  Her sister lived two months after being diagnosed because she was\n\nalready in the final stage.\n Her sister would talk about her \" sensitive stomach\" but did not go\n\nto the doctor until it was to late to treat.\n\n  \" The only thing I could do for her was to say, 'Sis, I 'm here\n\nfor you' and to rub her sore feet and let her know she is loved,\" Pasco\n\nsaid.\n\n  \" And now, I give back to the American Cancer Society hoping\n\nthere will be a cure someday - maybe not for me, but for my great -\n\ngrandchildren.\"\n\n  In 1985, the first Relay for Life was held in Tacoma, Washington\n\nwhen Dr. Gordon Glatt, a board member for the American Cancer Society Tacoma\n\nchapter, pledged to run for 24 hours to raise money for the American Cancer\n\nSociety.\n\n\n  The Big Island has four relays in Kapaau, Honokaa, Kailua - Kona\n\nand Hilo. \" It showcases American Cancer Society, celebrates cancer\n\nsurvivorship and honors people who have passed away,\" Kona chapter executive\n\ndirector Tina Clothier said.\n\n\n  Clothier said the 57 relay teams consisting of about 15 people\n\neach, has already given\n\n&dollar;63,000 to the American Cancer Society.\n The fund - raising goal for this event is\n\n&dollar;100,000.\n\n  The money benefits cancer patients in Hawaii, helps to fund\n\nnational and local research and the American Cancer Society Web site and\n\nnational call center, Clothier said.\n\n  Survivors started the relay at 7 p.m. with a \" victory lap.\n\n\n  During the event they had a luminary ceremony to remember those\n\nwho did not survive.\n Hula, line dancing, a talent show with team participants, as well as\n\nfood and game booths kept the teams going throughout the night.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5248430a-6220-4d9d-858e-54ba90112bc3", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.879293+00:00"}
{"text": "I never thought history would invite me for a grand gala of the\n\n1800 's.\n I could not believe that I would be in the midst of hoop dresses,\n\ntailored suits, servants, and home-drawn, black leather carriages.\n Finally, history had decided to reveal its wonders to someone of the\n\npresent.\n No longer would history be a book of musty pages and mildew travel\n\nchests.\n\n\n  I stood in the valley among elderly Walnut trees whose branches\n\nbent lifelessly against the ground waiting patiently for a kind Samaritan to\n\nrelieve them of their agony of age.\n As I looked around the grove of trees, there among the Walnuts stood\n\ngraceful Willow.\n These Willows hide their mournful souls for the causalities of the\n\nunforgiving wars behind their graceful limbs.\n They seem to dance in the gentle winds as they are performing an\n\nelegant ballet respectfully for their audience, all of the trees and the\n\nforest creatures.\n The elder members of the grove watch over the young chipmunks,\n\nrabbits, and birds which playfully entertain them.\n ( They do not seem to mind the youngsters climbing on their trunks\n\nand limbs; often throw them into the air like a first time father carefully\n\nand playfully throws his child into the air, then anticipating their descent\n\ninto their secure and protective arms below) The wild flowers, Violets,\n\nBlack-Eyed Susans, Dandelions, and Lilies, are carefully placed within the\n\ngrove as the beautiful floral patterns often used in the fashion of this\n\ntime.\n\n  As I begin to turn my attention away from the grove, I catch a\n\nglimpse an even greater wonder.\n I look beyond the eight flights of cobblestone steps to see the most\n\nbeautiful sight I have ever witnessed.\n Before I realized what was happening, my feet was already carrying me\n\ntoward this vision of historical beauty.\n As I reached the top of the worn down and uneven brownish- red\n\nstairway of stone, I stood motionless, overwhelmed by amazement.\n Cold, vigorous chills raced up my spine, as my brows became filled\n\nwith the sweat falling from my forehead.\n My petite pink silk shirt and navy cotton shorts clung to my clammy\n\nskin, leaving no curve of my figure to the imagination.\n The long hike up the stairway had filled my entire out of shape body\n\nwith pain and had stolen my oxygen from my lungs.\n I felt ever vein in my brain pumping and my ears were filled with\n\nonly one sound, the rhyme of my irregular heartbeat.\n My legs, unstable like that of a newborn calf 's, could not carry my\n\nweight any longer and finally gave out.\n It was at this moment I decided to rest and enjoy the wonder in front\n\nof me.\n\n  My eyes follow the towering Gothic giant from its sturdy legs to\n\nits beautiful face.\n It stands on a well constructed foundation made out of mortar and\n\nhand fired bricks.\n Its body is also handmade, but is not completely parallel.\n Yes, this is an imperfection, but doesn't cause its beauty to be\n\nrelinquished.\n This giant 's body is crowned with a copper weather vane, which\n\noffsets its reddish complexion.\n It is definitely the most exquisite site I have ever seen in my\n\nlife.\n\n  This mansion sits proudly on the green hillside as it protects\n\nthe sleepy little township below.\n The view of the township is lovely.\n The rolling, well- groomed pastures and the brown, fertile fields\n\nprotect the colorful and various sized homes from the surrounding counties.\n From the mansion 's view, the entire scene reminds me of a dazzling\n\nhomemade quilt: all of the stitches sown carefully by hand, and each piece of\n\nmaterial selected with great consideration and the entire quilt made with\n\ncare.\n The mansion is the last stitch added to the most important piece of\n\nthe traditional Wedding Ring pattern.\n\n  I notice that the mansion greets the steamboats, leisure boats,\n\nand barges with a firm wave hello as its black shutters flap in the whirling,\n\nyet refreshing wind.\n The boats, life long friends with the mansion over countless years,\n\nreturn the warm greeting with a heart felt blow of the foghorns.\n The entire valley is filled with the exchange of salutations between\n\nlife long friends, who time will never separate and who do not keep account\n\nof wrongs.\n It is a friendship built on understanding and compassion, not blame\n\nor spite. \n\n  I decided to venture inside and become more acquainted with my\n\nnew found friend.\n As I walk on the tall, white porch and look at the front door I am\n\nvery excited about what I see.\n The eight feet tall door 's panels form into the shape of a cross.\n The cross is used to let visitors and soldiers to know Christians\n\nlive in the household.\n I opened up the immense wooden slab, only to find a world of dated\n\nrelics and memories.\n\n  The Parlor 's red velvet curtains; green handwoven tapestry;\n\nimported cherry card table from England complete with clawed feet; porcelain\n\nvases and a horse-hair, high backed sitting couch elegantly set the mood of\n\nthis warm, friendly room.\n As I stand in the middle of the room, I shut my eyes and remain\n\nsilent.\n Suddenly my mind is flooded with images of tall, dark-haired\n\ngentlemen dressed in suits dancing, talking and engaging in old-fashioned\n\ngames, such as checkers, cards and dominos, with the company of well groomed,\n\nfair completed ladies whose social graces are the very finest.\n I envision waltzing and classical romantic music filling this\n\nbeautiful room.\n I also see young ladies andd gentlemen courting according to the\n\nsocial ritual of the time as their parents watch them very carefully as the\n\nmother works on her needlepoint and the father smokes a cigar and exhales the\n\ncircular puffs of smoke in the room.\n\n  I am abruptly taken from the Parlor into the Music Room.\n I stand amazed as in front of me on small metal rollers proudly sits\n\na Piano Forte.\n Beethoven and Mozart would be in a musician 's Heaven.\n Before me, sits an instrument made of fruitwood which consists of\n\npart piano and part harpsichord.\n As I glance around the remaining room, I see a Lincoln backed chair\n\nwhich is exactly like the one in White House.\n I also see a crimson, turquoise and frosted rug.\n But what grabs my attention to this rug is that it is handmade from\n\none-hundred percent wool fibers and consists of three, three feet sections\n\nwhich are stitched together.\n The bright colors light up the rarely used somber room.\n My gracious and knowledgeable hostess explains that this room is only\n\nuse when important guests, such as Mr.\n and Mrs.\n Abraham Lincoln-first cousins of House master, and George Washington\n\na family friend, arrive for what usually becomes a brief, yet exciting visit.\n This room is full of romantic music, freshly cut flowers, and\n\ninteresting intellectual conversation.\n\n  The Informal Dining Room leaves me emotionally drained; however,\n\nvery intrigued.\n This spiritless room touches my heart.\n As I silently stand in the room 's archway, I glance up a steep,\n\nperilous stairway that leads upstairs.\n The oak steps are only four inches wide and contain twenty steps\n\ntotal.\n It is the historical reference which causes me concern; this is the\n\nstairway servants were made to climb while carrying heavy food platters and\n\nporcelain chamber pots above to the bedrooms.\n I can not imagine how the servants could scale the narrow \" death\n\ntrap\" without having any rope or rails to hold onto and not spill anything in\n\nfear of getting punished for any catastrophe.\n\n  The Formal Dining Room is the most stunning chamber in the lower\n\nlevel of this historical home.\n It is decorated with century old, brass oil lamps; powder-puff blue\n\nchina dishes; red velvet curtains, which are draped back with golden, twisted\n\nrope tie backs.\n The cherry dinner table seats twelve persons and still offers plenty\n\nof elbow room for each guest.\n A large screen door ventilates this colossal vision of historical\n\nbeauty and splendor.\n A mirror designed from Bird 's- Eye Maple offsets the formality of the\n\ndark- colored cherry mantle, which secure the safety of valuable China and\n\nporcelain figurines.\n This room fills my mind with images of Christmas and Thanksgiving\n\ndinners, engagement announcements, and birthday celebrations.\n\n  As I remain stationary in the hallway of the lower level, I\n\nnotice the oil chandelier dangling lifelessly from the pale, plaster ceiling\n\nabove me.\n Its immense flame reflects through the glass doom and casts\n\nreflections of shadow puppets on the dim hallway walls.\n And in the midst of all this, lies a gracefully bent, cherry and\n\nwhite pine stairwell.\n This long, thirty stepped stairway leads to the mysteriously hidden\n\nsecond level, better known as the bedroom level.\n\n  I reluctantly ascend up the broad stairway upon my hostess 's\n\nrequest.\n To my surprise, there is an ebony, mink- haired couch.\n Inquisitively I ask my hostess the nature or purpose of this\n\nexquisite piece of furniture.\n \" Leisure reading, conversation between mother and children\n\nconcerning school or the family, and quilting and needlepoint gatherings\n\namong local women\" is the response I was given.\n This upper level is pretty as a result of its simple decor.\n There are four bedrooms total within the upper level, all complete\n\nwith high- rise, walnut beds; cherry chiffaros; wash basins; chamber pots and\n\nhomemade quilts for warmth and a comfortable night 's rest. <p\n\n<It is the floor length window at the far end of the hallway of the upper\n\nlevel, which creates the atmosphere for this part of the house.\n The window offers an overlook of the green, rolling extended lawn in\n\nfront of the house.\n This lawn, as it is explained to me, is better known by the\n\ntownspeople \" Butler 's Grove\".\n It is a common meeting place for the local socially elite to play\n\ncrochet; gather for church picnics; wedding ceremonies; political rallies and\n\na temporary battlefield for local disagreements; gun fights, often over\n\nladies; card games, or money.\n It is at this window, out on the black shingled, extended porch ledge\n\nwhich General Orlando Butler, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and other\n\nfamous persons addressed the small township of Port Royal in the 1800 's.\n\n  This house amazes me because the history of decades past silently\n\nanticipate the presence of a gracious and mannerly guest as it hides\n\nfragments of interesting stories in the nick and crannies of both levels.\n The lower hallway rings with shouts of battlefield victories, as the\n\nMaster of the house rides in on his horse through the tall front door and\n\nstops his horse in the middle of the hallway and shouts, \" We've 've.\n It 's finally over.\n We've 'ven\".\n This hallway receives its guests with the utmost respect and a very\n\nwarm welcome, complete with the stern handshake and gentle hug as to follow\n\nthe 1800 's rule of social etiquette.\n\n  I open the door to the house and step onto the front porch.\n I sit down on the steps of this small but cozy porch and look down at\n\nthe green, fertile lawn below me.\n I hear the echoes of children laughing as they roll up into firm\n\nlittle balls and they roll down the rolling grassy hillside.\n I can hear the gunshots of the century 's gentlemen settling\n\ndisagreements with the weapons of the time.\n I can hear the sound of large groups of people laughing, telling\n\nstories and reminsing over time gone past.\n I smell the scent of Spring flowers and feel the cool breeze softly\n\nrubbing against my pale, youthful skin- a result of Oil of O'Lay.\n I see the image of children playing old-fashioned games, such as Hoop\n\nRolling, Red Rover, and Simon Says, as the older generation enjoy maze,\n\ncreated from hay bales formed into various shaped lines and angles,\n\nsolving.\n\n  I am sitting in the presence of historical elegance, social\n\ngrace, and dated furniture and traditions.\n I don't think I will ever be able to swallow all of this history;\n\nhowever, I would like to try.\n Today is the first time I have been introduced to this mansion, but\n\nI have all summer to become better acquainted.\n I have just met my friend for the next three months.\n I saw today what will be my historical home where I will conduct\n\npublic tours, carefully clean, and protect under the title of Recreation\n\nDepartment Staff of Kentucky State Park Systems- Head Tour Guide.\n I am excited about the flashbacks to history to come if they 're like\n\nthe one I experienced today.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e07254c6-dc3b-4e32-b869-51b430198bef", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.880694+00:00"}

Get in van!\" shouts the ringmaster.\n \" Everything OK now.\n Nothing to look at.\n\n\n  \" Baby crocodile crawled out of the sewer yesterday, damned if it\n\ndidn't bite my landlady!\" says a nonplussed pedestrian, continuing his broken\n\nstride. \n\n  \" Don't say.\n Good things come in small packages.\n Remember that guy with 93 outstanding parking tickets?\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Newtopia employs corporal punishment to achieve its rigid social\n\norder.\n Miscreants and nogoodniks are dealt with swiftly and effectively\n\naccording to a graduated scale of evil-doing.\n Jaywalking, spitting, and littering bring a quick five hundred dollar\n\nfine, as does the use of a public toilet without flushing afterwards.\n More serious crimes are punished by fining and beating the guilty\n\nindividual.\n Tampering with a telephone on the subway, peeing in an elevator, and\n\nbad-mouthing a police officer all result in a fine and a beating.\n Counterfeiting results in a\n\n&dollar;10,000 fine and five beatings. \n\n  A beating is an organized affair, in which an appointment is made\n\nfor the sentenced offender to appear at an office, rather like a visit to the\n\ndentist.\n Appointments are rarely missed, due to the ten- fold nature of\n\nescalating punishments.\n Paperwork is required to officiate the event, \" Please sign here and\n\nhere in triplicate...and here...\"Awaiting the soon-to-be-reformed criminal\n\nare two police officers and a government doctor in an examination room,\n\ncompletely bare of furniture except for a small stainless steel table on\n\nwhich sits a clipboard and a medical bag.\n The penitent citizen is checked for sobriety, directed to strip down\n\nto his/her underwear, and advised to assume a stance of attention in the\n\ncenter of the room. \n\n  The two officers proceed to administer the beating, which I will\n\ndescribe sparingly, using no scathing adjectives or graphic similies. \n\n  Using weathered bamboo canes three feet long, both officers\n\nbrutally deliver slicing blows from far overhead, like lumberjacks chopping\n\nwood.\n The hapless recipient generally falls quickly to the linoleum floor,\n\nbut the beating continues relentlessly.\n The two officers trade blows like Chinese slaves building an American\n\nrailroad.\n Each blow raises a discoloring welt or breaks the skin, and crimson\n\ntears flow from the shallow wounds.\n The antidoctor, assigned to prevent death from excessive abuse,\n\ndetermines the merciful end of the beating when the victim is suitably\n\nreprimanded.\n After a few minutes, most citizens walk out under their own power.\n\n\n\n  If the criminal has been sentenced to more than one beating, an\n\ninterval of time is prescribed between beatings for the wounds to heal.\n Some persons convicted of multiple crimes are suffered to endure the\n\nlesser punishments, i.e.\n beatings, before the ultimate penalty, namely, hanging to death.\n Smugglers, pushers, and users are all sentenced to death, as are all\n\nperpetrators of violent crimes.\n Participants in shootouts with police are never tried -

{"text": "Surprise rejection of Tampa Bay offer moves him to top of Wolf 's\n\nlist \n\n  Green Bay, Wis. - - If Bill Parcells wants to return to coaching -\n\n- and there are strong indications that he does-he could be named coach of\n\nthe Green Bay Packers as early as Tuesday.\n General manager Ron Wolf said Sunday night that he was attempting to\n\nset up an interview with Parcells for Tuesday and that he was in position to\n\nmatch Tampa Bay 's salary figures in his offer to Parcells.\n\n  Parcells rejected a five-year,\n\n&dollar;6.5 million deal from the Buccaneers Saturday night.\n Wolf declined to comment when asked whether Parcells could have the\n\nPackers' job if he wanted it.\n But sources in the organization have said Parcells had been the No.1\n\ncandidate on the Packers' list from the start.\n However, until Sunday, Wolf believed that Parcells was unattainable.\n Wolf 's plans for the next two days also suggest that he is focusing\n\nhis search on Parcells and will offer him the job unless something develops\n\nin the interview that makes him uncomfortable. \n\n  Wolf said he had postponed an interview with former Seattle\n\nSeahawks coach Chuck Knox, scheduled for Monday in Palm Springs, Calif.\n\n Wolf 's plans for the next two days also suggest that he is focusing\n\nhis search on Parcells and will offer him the job unless something develops\n\nin the interview that makes him uncomfortable. \n\n  Wolf said he had postponed an interview with former Seattle\n\nSeahawks coach Chuck Knox, scheduled for Monday in Palm Springs, Calif.\n\n\n  \" There is a new development that has caused me to cancel the\n\nvisit and schedule it for a different time.\n Wolf said, referring to Parcells' decision to reject Tampa Bay 's\n\noffer. \n\n  Wolf also said he would put on hold any plans to contact\n\nassistant coaches around the National Football League.\n Wolf interviewed Mike Holmgren, offensive coordinator of the San\n\nFrancisco 49ers, here Sunday.\n But Wolf said he would hold off on asking permission to talk to\n\ndefensive coordinators Steve Sidwell of the New Orleans Saints and Pete\n\nCarroll of the New York Jets, who would presumably be available for\n\ninterviews now that their teams have lost in the playoffs. \n\n  After saying for several days that he planned to take his time\n\nconducting the search, Wolf said that could change.\n \" It could happen quickly,\" Wolf said.\n \" The reason I said that all along is because I never thought Bill\n\nwould come here.\n \" I had him penciled in for Tampa and I felt it behooved us to\n\nexplore all avenues.\"\n\n  Wolf said he had just begun his interview with Holmgren when his\n\ntelephone in the Packers offices started ringing non-stop.\n The phone rang, Wolf said, after the announcement by Buccaneers owner\n\nHugh Culverhouse that Parcells had turned down the job.\n Wolf said the announcement surprised him.\n Wolf said he talked to Parcells later about following through with a\n\nmeeting they had tentatively arranged last Friday.\n\n  Wolf said he did not have any assurances that Parcells would\n\nreturn to coaching or accept an offer from the Packers.\n \" I don't have any feel,\" Wolf said.\n\n\n  After leading the New York Giants to two Super Bowl titles in\n\neight years, Parcells resigned after the 1990'91 season to become a studio\n\nanalyst with NBC-TV.\n\n  ESPN reported that NBC had agreed to let Parcells become its top\n\nanalyst next season, replacing Bill Walsh, as an incentive to remain with the\n\nnetwork.\n An NBC representative told the Washington Post that the report was \"\n\ncategorically untrue.\n If it is true, Parcells' salary to stay with NBC could rise from\n\n&dollar;250,000 to as much as\n\n&dollar;600.000.\n\n  Parcells said on NBC 's pre-game show Sunday that he hadn't made\n\nup his mind about coaching again and he might return to NBC.\n But in explaining why he rejected the Tampa Bay offer, Parcells never\n\nonce said it was because he didn't want to coach.\n\n  With a salary offer that apparently would, have made him the\n\nhighest-paid coach in the NFL, Parcells was offered full control of the\n\nfootball operation with the Buccaneers. \n\n  \" I thought it may have been too big a job, too many hats to wear\n\nin this modern time of professional football,\" Parcells said.\n \" There was just something about it in the end.\n I didn't feel right.\n\n\n  Wolf can't offer Parcells full control of the football operation,\n\nbut he suggested he could match Tampa Bay 's offer of\n\n&dollar;1.3 million per year.\n \" I don't think money is an issue with this franchise.\n\n\n  Asked specifically about the Green Bay job, Parcells said: \" Ron\n\nand I have talked.\n We agreed to setup a meeting at some point in time.\n I don't know when it is, but I just assume we will talk again in the\n\nnear future.\n\n\n  Culverhouse said Parcells had agreed to take it.\n \" I feel I was taken down to the altar and there was a choke,\"\n\nCulverhouse said.\n \" I'm still here 'm the altar.\n Culverhouse said he pressed Parcells for reasons and Parcells never\n\nsaid he had decided not to coach.\n\n  Culverhouse also said it wouldn't surprise him if Parcells\n\naccepted the Green Bay job.\n \" I feel Bill will feel closer to Ron Wolf\" Culverhouse said.\n Parcells, 50, compiled an 05-50-1? record, a 61 winning percentage as\n\ncoach of the Giants.\n\n  In five of his eight seasons, the Giants qualified for the\n\nplayoffs.\n Parcells' first team finished 3-12-1 and only one other team after\n\nthat had a losing record.\n The Giants were 6-9 in 1987.\n\n\n  The Giants won the Super Bowl under Parcells in 1987 and this\n\nyear. \n\n  Parcells was shaken in recent years when Denver Broncos coach Dan\n\nReeves and Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka developed heart problems.\n In the last year, physicians discovered that Parcells had extra\n\nheartbeats.\n Two weeks ago, he underwent an angioplasty, a non-surgical procedure\n\nto clear a blocked artery leading from the heart and although Parcells has\n\nsaid NC?, the Giants afterward he was healthy enough to coach, he might be in\n\nconflict about his future.\n\n  \" From the tone of his conversation,\" one friend told The New\n\nYork Times, \" his head is being one way and his heart in another.\n\n  Wolf said he was impressed with Holmgren during their meeting.\n\n\n  \" He was easy to talk with, talk to.\n He 's very confident of himself and it 's easy to see why they are\n\nsuccessful with him running the show from an offensive standpoint.\n\n\n\n\n Officials say drug abuse is still tearing at families Reports of\n\nabuse, neglect are down, but still severe.\n\n\n  Rampant drug abuse among parents continues to tear apart\n\nthousands of Milwaukee County families, although authorities reported a\n\nreduction this year in the number of families whose children suffer from\n\nabuse and neglect.\n\n  The county Department of Health and Human Services will have\n\ninvestigated about 8,500 cases of child abuse and neglect by the end of this\n\nyear.\n That compares to an all time high of about 9,100 cases investigated\n\nlast year, department spokesman Jeff Aikin said. \n\n  \" This will probably be our second biggest year of referrals\n\never,\" Aikin said.\n\n  Department records show that nearly 80% of al% child neglect\n\ncases involve parents who are drug abusers.\n A smaller but significant number of child abuse cases also involve\n\nparents who abuse drugs, he said.\n\n  Social workers said that aside from drug abuse, high-risk\n\nindicators of child abuse and neglect included poverty, teenage parenthood\n\nand single parenthood.\n And despite the decline in the number of cases, the seriousness of\n\nchild neglect and abuse incidents continue to increase. \n\n  One extreme example cited by Aikin occurred / 1.20, when 10\n\nMilwaukee children, including three who authorities said were severely\n\nmalnourished, were removed from their 38-year-old mother 's home.\n The woman, who told police she uses cocaine, was charged Friday with\n\nThree counts of child neglect and one count of child abuse.\n All the children were turned over to the county 's Department of\n\nSocial Services and are residing in foster agencies to dehomes.\n\n  The woman 's 3-year-old boy weighed 20.2 pounds, a 28-month-old\n\ngirl weighed 17.7 pounds and a 16-month-old girl weighed 17.9 pounds, a\n\ncriminal complaint says.\n Police and social workers sent to the home Dec. 20 found belt marks\n\non the chest and back of the 3-year-old boy. \n\n  The mother said the marks were caused by a belt she used for\n\ntoilet training.\n In addition the 16-month-old had two infected ears and a perforated\n\neardrum and the 28-month-old had inflamed membranes in her ears caused by\n\ndehydration and malnutrition, the complaint says.\n The children were taken to Children 's Hospital of Wisconsin for\n\ntreatment of malnutrition and dehydration.\n\n  Hospital personnel said the weights of the three were far below\n\nnormal.\n Normal weights for healthy children of average height aged 3 years\n\nfor boys, 28 months for girls and 16 months for girls should be about 32\n\npounds, 27.5 pounds and 23 pounds, respectively, hospital officials said.\n\n  Authorities, who reported there was ample food in the house, said\n\nthe woman 's other children were not suffering from malnutrition.\n The woman acknowledged that her three youngest children looked ill\n\npolice said.\n \" All the cases we' 'reseeing are more aggravated now than they were\n\n10 or 15 years ago,\" Aikin said.\n \" We' 'rehoping that a number of initiatives put into place by\n\nMilwaukee County and various private agencies to deal with child abuse are\n\nhaving an impact.\n\n\n\n  To help curb such incidents of child abuse and neglect, Milwaukee\n\ncounty spends about\n\n&dollar;1 million in tax dollars a year for prevention programs.\n In the past five years, Aikin said, the number of programs initiated\n\nthrough area hospitals and private social service groups has increased.\n First-time parent programs provide services for new parents.\n Teenage parent programs offer education to teenagers, regardless of\n\nhow many children they have.\n Abuse counseling is available for parents who were victims of child\n\nabuse.\n \" There are a number of efforts underway.\n Aikin said.\n \" We' 'rehoping it is having an impact.\n It 's always difficult to measure success.\n But if we measure it in the number of cases we 're seeing, then we 're\n\nhaving some impact.\n\n  The proposed Rail Energy prices is no longer a good one for\n\nstruggling businesses like Ash Grove Cement of Montana City.\n The cement making business, which earlier in the year used diesel\n\ngenerators to make its own power because it could not find cheap electricity,\n\nnow has an affordable contract, said Ash Grove environmental manager Joe\n\nScheeler. \n\n  The cement plant dismantled its generators at the beginning of\n\nthe month.\n\n  \" We latched onto a contract for three months, enough to get\n\nthrough the summer,\" Scheeler said.\n\n\n  Rail Energy also planned to locate six more power producing\n\nlocomotives north of Three Forks at Trident.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source":

{"text": "My academic library is in the market for a new integrated library\n\nsystem.\n As part of this process we've done all t 'veusual things, including\n\ndrawing up wish lists of desirable OPAC features and using them to evaluate\n\nnumerous systems.\n\n  We've also taken 'veo far more interesting steps.\n First, we actually asked the faculty what they thought were important\n\nfeatures to have in an online catalog.\n ( This was suggested by a faculty member.)\n Second, on three separate occasions we set up \" demonstration\n\nstations\"--terminals in the library connected to two or more of the systems\n\nunder consideration--for hands-on use by faculty and students.\n Some of the systems were graphical, some character based.\n In some cases, we showed two versions of the same system.\n We provided comment sheets for signed or anonymous remarks, and staff\n\nwere available nearby to give help or take reactions.\n\n\n  The results probably won't be turned into a major motion picture\n\nanytime soon, but they aren't without interest either.\n Here are several lessons I've drawn from 'veis experience.\n And no, I'm not naming 'mmes; if you think you can identify a sinning\n\nor virtuous system, keep it to yourself.\n\n\n  Vendors take note: if the academic community were in charge of\n\nselection, the race would go to the swiftest.\n The most frequently repeated positive comments recorded in six weeks\n\nof demonstration stations were in praise of fast response times.\n The most frequent negative remarks concerned slow response times.\n\n\n  \" Prefer keyboard to mouse.\"\n \" Personally, I hate using a mouse and find it far more trouble than\n\nit 's worth.\"\n There were numerous comments along these lines, including my\n\nfavorite: \" I worry about old profs using the mouse.\"\n\n  This leads me to several thoughts.\n First, it 's a mistake to assume that everyone knows how to use the\n\nrodent or sees any virtue in becoming mouse-literate.\n We have DOS-based machines that won't be upgraded for years.\n We have hundreds of students doing everything from e-mail to serious\n\ncomputation via command-line prompts on central UNIX clusters.\n\n\n  Second, mice are troublesome.\n They have a tendency to walk out the front door if not secured.\n They take up valuable counter space and work poorly on most surfaces.\n The obvious solution is to use keyboards with built-in trackballs for\n\nin-library OPAC stations.\n However, this aggravates the first problem: how many of us are handy\n\nwith a trackball?\n\n  Third, it is a great step backwards to force patrons to switch\n\nfrom keyboard to mouse with great regularity.\n A fact of life: you can't type a search string without the keyboard.\n Why should you be forced to also point-and-click to select an index,\n\nto position the cursor for data entry, or to perform any other adjunct to our\n\nmost common of functions, the OPAC search?\n\n  Here 's the moral of this story: a graphical interface should not\n\nrequire a mouse.\n It should allow a mouse, and it should be designed to capitalize on\n\nthose areas where pointing, clicking, and dragging really are superior ways\n\nof communicating human intentions to a small square box.\n But mouse commands should have keyboard equivalents, and basic acts\n\nlike entering a search should not require hand movement from the keyboard to\n\nthe mouse pad.\n\n\n  One might expect that patrons would prefer any graphical user\n\ninterface to a terminal-based or character interface, if for no other reason\n\nthan a GUI seems so much more modern.\n Not so in our experience.\n Of all the OPACs we demonstrated, two systems from two different\n\nvendors received the largest number of positive responses; one was graphical\n\nand the other character-based.\n What they had in common was the general feeling that they were \" easy\n\nto use.\"\n\n  The general feeling about Microsoft Windows interfaces is that\n\nthey can be particularly difficult to use.\n Developers need to remember that human beings are not born with an\n\ninnate knowledge of Windows, and that Windows conventions are not intuitively\n\nobvious to the uninitiated.\n An interface that will go to great lengths to explain catalog-related\n\nfunctions ( \" Author search: enter words from author 's name\") may assume that\n\npatrons know how to use a scroll bar or close a window.\n Some GUIs let you move and minimize windows, not anticipating the\n\nunhappy scenario when one patron minimizes the search window and the next\n\npatron walks up to a totally unfamiliar screen.\n\n  Developers should also remember that icons are memory aids for\n\nfunctions that people are already aware of.\n They don't substitute for help, mnemonics, or textual explanations of\n\navailable functions.\n If words like \" search\" or \" next\" can fit on a button, they are\n\nlikely to be more illuminating to the average patron than the picture of a\n\nmagnifying glass or a left arrow.\n Until we have a common command language for icons, let 's give the\n\nuser a break and assume that one word is worth a thousand pictures.\n\n\n  As noted above, character-based interfaces were not universally\n\nscorned.\n Nonetheless, our users were quick to differentiate the good from the\n\nbad and the ugly.\n People liked not having to press the Enter key when selecting from\n\nlimited choices on a menu ( a feature possible in UNIX systems that 3270-type\n\ntransmission doesn't allow).\n They liked long, clear prompts at the bottom of the screen, such as \"\n\nShow items with the same subject\" and \" Limit this search,\" even if it meant\n\nthat an \" Other options\" prompt was needed for additional choices that didn't\n\nfit on one page.\n\n  Users did not like having to move the cursor around the screen to\n\nhighlight and select menu options.\n They did not like more than one way of doing something or when it was\n\nnot clear how to do something ( e.g., type first letter of option or move\n\ncursor to option and press enter).\n\n\n  Users did not like having to return to a search options menu by\n\nrequesting \" new search\" or \" another search\" in order to type a new search.\n They didn't see why they couldn't have a command line on each screen\n\nfrom which they could enter searches.\n On the other hand, users didn't seem to mind having to go through\n\nseveral layers of menus to do something special, like limit a search result\n\nset, while library staff rebelled against those hierarchies.\n Patrons seemed more concerned that directions for out-of-the-ordinary\n\nactions be clear than that they be quick or streamlined.\n\n\n  Almost every system we evaluated had a feature to allow a user to\n\neasily issue searches related to a given work.\n That is, once users found a relevant catalog record, the system let\n\nthem search the added entries, tracings, and/or call numbers from that record\n\nwithout rekeying.\n\n  In most systems, this option was called \" related works\" or\n\nsomething of that sort, and selecting it would take patrons to a screen\n\nlisting authors, subjects, series, and call numbers.\n When the user chose a heading or call number, the system would\n\nautomatically perform the search.\n Nobody commented on this capability, positively or negatively, for\n\nany of these systems.\n\n  In one OPAC, an option was limited to call numbers and was called\n\n\" show items nearby on shelf.\"\n More than a dozen people commented.\n \" Browsing what 's nearby on the shelf is a very convenient feature.\"\n \" 'Show items nearby on shelf' speeds research and makes this choice\n\nnumber 1.\" \n\n\n  We sent a questionnaire to faculty and library staff asking them\n\nto rate the importance of various OPAC features and tabulated the responses\n\nof each group separately.\n The widest difference in opinion concerned the value of search limits\n\nby language, location, and material type, and the value of call number\n\nbrowsing.\n Library staff rated all these features as highly desirable, while the\n\nfaculty weren't particularly interested.\n Search limits by material type ranked lowest of all the features we\n\ninquired about.\n ( The ability to limit retrievals by date, on the other hand, was\n\nwidely desired.)\n\n  As a general rule, library staff rated almost all features closer\n\nto the \" very important\" end of the scale than the faculty did.\n The single feature most important to faculty was network access,\n\nfollowed closely by modem access.\n We have to face it: the faculty 's main goal is to stay away from the\n\nlibrary.\n One implication is that we won't be able to provide much personalized\n\ninstruction and on-the-spot assistance.\n Perhaps it is no coincidence that the feature the faculty ranked\n\nsecond highest was \" adequate online help, both contextual and explicitly\n\nrequestable.\"\n\n\n  Patrons want empowerment--all sorts of empowerment.\n They want to be able to designate any record or set of records and\n\ndownload it, or print it, or e-mail it to themselves.\n They want to issue holds and recalls for material that 's charged out\n\nto others and renew materials charged out to themselves.\n They want to view their own patron records, fine records, and loan\n\nrecords.\n They want to be able to request that materials be delivered to them,\n\nordered for them, and put on reserve for them.\n They want to be able to make comments and suggestions to the\n\nlibrary.\n\n  No negative comment was made about any patron empowerment\n\nfunction, except perhaps that it was not comprehensive enough, or didn't\n\noffer enough options.\n\n\n\n  Of course, we got a lot of other comments, many very useful, many\n\nvery specific to the OPACs under consideration.\n Often people expressed completely opposite opinions.\n \" I love Windows.\"\n \" I hate Windows.\"\n \" This system is great.\"\n \" This system is awful.\"\n But behind almost all of the rants and the raves was the concept of\n\nease of use.\n \" I love

are not created equal.\n\n  Since I assume nobody actually sits down to work and says, \"\n\nLet 's make this catalog hard to use,\" maybe we should all spend more time\n\nwatching students and

{"text": "Spring time is here yet again.\n Outside the trees are green and luscious, the birds are singing a\n\nwelcome song for the warm air and the blooming flowers.\n Everyone seems to want to be outdoors more than they did a few weeks\n\nago, and they seem to be in more cheerful spirits.\n And, as the old saying goes, \" Love is in the air.?\n But for me, when this time of year comes around an unstoppable sense\n\nof sadness always creeps upon me, and tears well up in my eyes for no\n\napparent reason, and a lump occupies my throat causing my voice to break\n\nperiodically.\n This happens every spring because I remember a time five years ago\n\nwhen love was in the air for me.\n I was on the verge of falling head over heels in love with a close\n\nfriend I had known since I was three years old, when it all came to a\n\nscreeching halt that changed my life forever.\n\n  I first met Eric in the church nursery when I was three years old\n\nduring Vacation Bible School.\n He and I were the only \" big kids\" in the nursery class.\n We weren't big enough to be in the preschool class, but we were too\n\nbig to be babies so we couldn't take naps and drink bottles.\n Instead, we had to rely on each other for companionship and\n\nentertainment.\n For the whole week, we would share crayons and color pictures of\n\nJesus, Moses, and Noah together, and then argue over who had colored the\n\nprettiest.\n We would build huge castle out of stacking blocks and then knock them\n\ndown.\n Every time he would crash through the walls, his reddish-brown hair\n\nwould fall into his eyes so he couldn't see where he was going.\n And, I would get trampled.\n One time when we went outside to get cookies and Kool-aid, I was\n\nrunning and fell down.\n I looked down at my bloody, skinned knee and started to cry.\n Eric came over and while petting my hand, asked me if I needed him to\n\ncall an ambulance to unhurt my leg.\n By the end of the week we were inseparable, and continued to play\n\ntogether all the time as he conveniently lived just up the road from me.\n\n  When we started first grade together, he was there to keep me\n\nfrom being scared according to my mom.\n But, I think I helped him more than he did me.\n I was ready to go to school, but Eric cried when his mom dropped him\n\noff.\n So, it was my turn to pet him on the head and call an ambulance to\n\nunhurt him.\n The next seven years of elementary school we spent together in the\n\nsame class every day talking at lunch, playing at recess, borrowing pencils\n\nfrom each other, and letting him copy my math homework sometimes.\n\n\n  Since the eighth grade was incorporated into the high school\n\ncurriculum back then, I was apprehensive about our friendship remaining since\n\nthere was a chance that we wouldn't be in the same classes.\n I was afraid that we wouldn't be able to talk very much or spend very\n\nmuch time together.\n I was also afraid that we would grow apart because we wouldn't have\n\nas much in common anymore.\n But, fate intervene and we had all six classes together our eighth\n\ngrade year as well as our ninth grade year.\n We spent time together and was always there when we needed each\n\nother.\n\n  I made sure I was there for him the summer before our freshmen\n\nyear when his dad died slowly of lung cancer.\n I watched him grow up so quickly.\n Almost overnight he went from being a thirteen year old boy to the\n\nman of the house.\n Everything about him changed.\n He became a much more serious person about life.\n He tried his best to make sure that everyone else had something to\n\nlaugh and smile about whether he did or not.\n He grew four inches in height during our freshmen year, and for once\n\nwas taller than me.\n His face began to take on the appearance of a young man, the chubby\n\ncheeks adorned with dimples melted away.\n The once carefree brown hair was now neatly in place, the shorter cut\n\ntook away his red highlights.\n His green eyes in the past had been mischievously bright, but were\n\nnow almost hard and serious due to the pain he had felt, and would never get\n\nover.\n\n  In public, Eric acted like he was coping with his father 's long\n\nillness and death, but I knew how hurt he was and how much he wanted to be\n\nwith his father, no matter what the cost.\n I knew that he was only being strong for his mother and little\n\nsister, and he did everything he could to fill his father 's shoes for them.\n He took it upon himself to do without the normal materialistic \"\n\nnecessities\" of the typical teenager.\n He saved his allowance in case an emergency ever arose and they\n\nneeded the money.\n He was so noble and brave, yet he never felt like he was doing enough\n\nto make his dad proud.\n I tried to tell him he was doing the best he could and that was what\n\nmattered.\n I wanted him to understand he was just a kid and his father would not\n\nhave wanted him to lose his youth because he had lost his father.\n But, his heart was so full of pain that he no longer seemed to be the\n\nfriend I had once known.<./p>\n\n  When he turned sixteen during our sophomore year in high school,\n\nthings began to get better for him.\n He bought himself a car with the money he had saved and got an after\n\nschool job.\n He was slowly adjusting to the loss of his father.\n Once again, he became carefree and fun-loving.\n We would go riding around town together, and talk about everything.\n I helped to fix him up with another one of my close friend.\n Eventhough it didn't work out and he had the worst date imaginable\n\nwith her, it gave us something to laugh about together.\n He told me it was too bad my friend hadn't been more like me, because\n\nI was the ideal girl he wanted to go out with.\n But, we were too good of friends to risk losing our friendship in\n\ncase things didn't work out.\n\n\n  We began to go out more and more, and everyone was asking us if\n\nwe were a couple.\n We would just smile and say \" We'r 'renly friends.?\n Yet, things began to happen between us and I felt this deep and close\n\nbond developing between us.\n I think he felt it too. We began to talk about our futures.\n Both of us wanted to be lawyers, and he said he would create his own\n\nfirm, and that he would let me be a partner so he couldn't be accused of any\n\nsexual discrimination.\n We would spend all day at school together and then come home and\n\nspend all night talking on the phone, supposedly doing homework.\n\n  One night when we were riding around together, he was so quiet\n\nand distant.\n I kept asking him what was wrong, but he would say nothing.\n Then, out of the blue, he asked me if I thought that if he were to\n\ndie tomorrow would his little two year old nephew ( his older half-sister 's\n\nson) remember who \" Uncle Eric\" was.\n And, he wanted to known if anyone would miss him, if he was gone\n\nforever.\n I told him that everyone would remember him and miss him, but I told\n\nhim that he was being silly because nothing was going to happen to him.\n When he dropped me off at home that night, he leaned over and pecked\n\nme on the lips before I got out of the car.\n At that moment, I knew that we were on our way to becoming more than\n\nfriends.\n\n  On May 11, this all came to a stop.\n That Friday afternoon, Eric had said at school that he would do\n\nanything to get out of taking his finals, and he got his wish.\n That Friday night, he went out with the guys and never made it home.\n At approximately 11:30 that night his truck went off the road and hit\n\na tree.\n At 6:45 the next morning, he was found dead.\n My heart broke in two when I found out that he had laid on the side\n\nof the road for hours slowly bleeding to death.\n He had not been killed instantly, and because his truck was black and\n\nhad went off the road on a decline into the woods, no one had seen it until\n\nthe sun came up.\n My mind can not forget this image of him lying helplessly bleeding in\n\npain, and no one came to help him until it was too late.\n\n  Three days later, on May 14 - my sixteenth birthday, Eric was\n\nburied.\n And along with him, my first love was covered with dirt and gone\n\nbefore it really had a chance to begin.\n So as those dates draw closer, tears and brushed aside pain fill my\n\nheart.\n It took me over four years to allow myself to care about a guy as\n\nmuch as I did Eric.\n I decided at his burial that I never wanted to feel that kind of pain\n\nagain.\n I hated to hear the saying \" it is better to have loved and lost,\n\nthen to never had loved at all.\" then, but now when I think about Eric, I\n\nhave something to remember that is very special.\n And that memory will never die eventhough Eric did.\n So now, once again I am falling in love, but I still can't help but\n\nwonder \" what if...\". \n\n\n\n\n\n  Have you ever stopped what you were doing, opened a window,\n\nthrown off your shoes and just looked out?\n I do not mean sat there to be lazy and fall asleep, or to watch\n\ntelevision.\n I mean sat down and really looked out a window and soaked up nature.\n If not, might I suggest a daily dose of window watching.

{"text": "What is dominant [ in the symbol] is the inexpressible which, in\n\nseeking expression, will ultimately burst the too fragile vessel of earthly\n\nform by the infinite power of its being.\n But herewith the clarity of vision is itself immediately destroyed,\n\nand all that remains is speechless wonder.\n Friedrich Creuzer in Walter Benjamin, The Origin of German Tragic\n\nDrama\n\n  The discussion of the differentiation of the allegorical and\n\nsymbolic has had considerable influence on the conceptualization and\n\nvalidation of specific artistic techniques and forms of aesthetic experience.\n The Romantic denigration of the allegorical and its corresponding\n\naffirmation of the symbolic began with Goethe in the late 18th-Century and\n\nsubsequently found its way into the writings of A.W. Schlegel, Fredrich W.J.\n\nSchelling, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and Novalis in Germany, as well as Samuel\n\nTaylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth and Thomas Carlyle in England.\n Continuing interest in the symbol-allegory distinction can be found in\n\nthe literary criticism of Roman Jakobson, Northrop Frye, and Paul de Man, and\n\nthe work of a number of other contemporary art critics and historians such as\n\nCraig Owens.\n In his Trauerspiel study, Walter Benjamin attempted to redeem the\n\nallegorical mode as an artistic technique on par with that of the symbolic.\n Although Benjamin 's text dealt exclusively with the Baroque period, it\n\nis apparent that allegory informs not only the Modernist techniques of\n\nMontage, Collage and Assemblage in both literature and visual arts, but the\n\nwhole of interpretive writing.\n It therefore becomes important to comprehend the historical genesis of\n\nthis distinction.\n This shall not be undertaken merely as an attempt to redeem Modernist\n\nforms of allegory for ourselves, but to lead us to the validation of a\n\nbroader range \" aesthetic\" experience.\n\n\n  The earliest characterization of the symbol that we can clearly\n\nrecognize as our own is found in Kant 's Critique of Judgment ( 1790).\n In &sect59 entitled 'Beauty as a Symbol of Morality' Kant objects to\n\nthe improper use of the word 'symbol' to describe mathematical abstractions (\n\ne.g.\n symbolic logic), and instead defines the symbolical as a form of\n\nhypotyposis, a rhetorical mode involving 'presentation' or 'sensible\n\nillustration'.\n For Kant, there are two forms of hypotyposis: schematical and\n\nsymbolical.\n Both confer something of the nature of a concept ( Begriff) without\n\nbeing mere signs directly designating the concept itself.\n The schematical mode illustrates the concept by demonstration, acting\n\nas a formal analog to the concept ( as a drawn triangle would refer to the\n\nabstract principle which it both represents and conforms).\n On the other hand the symbolic mode represents that for which, \" no\n\nsensory representation would be appropriate.\"\n Paul de Man described hypotyposis in general as, \" [ that] which\n\nmakes present to the senses something which is out of their reach, not just\n\nbecause it does not happen to be there but because it consists, in whole or\n\nin part, of elements too abstract for sensory representation.?\n The symbolic in this sense expresses a concept, \" not by means of\n\ndirect intuition, but only by analogy with it, i.e. by the transference of\n\nreflection upon the object of intuition to a quite different concept to which\n\nperhaps an intuition can never directly correspond.\"\n The reflection of the object at hand in the intuition or imagination,\n\nbrings forth a correlation with a concept for which there is no adequate\n\nrepresentation.\n\n  Kant 's relation of beauty to morality operates symbolically;\n\nmorality is not found to reside in the beautiful form ( i.e.\n beauty is not the sensuous presentation of 'mora 'mty'), nor does\n\nbeauty demonstratively 'show' the nature of morality ( as would a schema).\n Instead the relationship is one of analogy in which the two concepts 'beauty'\n\nand 'mor 'mity' are found to function according to similar formal principle.\n Kant states that language is, \" full of indirect presentations of\n\nthis sort, in which the expression does not contain the proper schema for the\n\nconcept, but merely a symbol for reflection,\" as when for example the word 'ground'\n\nis substituted for 'support' or 'basis', or to 'flow' from something is\n\nemployed instead of 'to follow'.\n Thus, it is through a process akin to metaphor that beautiful form is\n\nfound to represent morality.\n This formulation is directly linked to Kant 's discussion of\n\nnon-discursive knowledge, and represents a manner in which empirical sense\n\nexperience can lead to knowledge of concepts which would otherwise be\n\nunavailable through purely empirical or conceptual means.\n Although this brief statement represents one of the earliest\n\nformulations of the modern symbol, Kant never returned to this line of\n\nthought in his later writings.\n\n  In the end it was not Kant, but Goethe, whose formulation of the\n\nsymbol-allegory distinction became definitive.\n Before Goethe the terms 'symbol' and 'allegory' were used\n\ninterchangeably to name any general mode in which one thing served to\n\ndesignate another.\n Hans-Georg Gadamer notes that, \" Winckelmann, whose influence on the\n\naesthetics and philosophy of history of the time was very great, used both\n\nterms synonymously; the same was true of eighteenth-century aesthetics as a\n\nwhole.?\n Goethe redefined the pair antithetically to describe two forms of\n\nrepresentation each with its own method and result.\n\n\n  1. Symbolism transforms appearance into an idea, the idea into an\n\nimage in such a way that the idea remains always infinitely effective and\n\nunreachable in the image and remains ineffable even if uttered in all\n\nlanguages.\n\n  2. Allegory transforms appearance into a concept, the concept\n\ninto an image, but in such a way that the concept can be grasped and can be\n\nhad completely as something delimited in the image and can be expressed in\n\nit.\n\n  3. It is a big difference whether the poet looks for the\n\nparticular in the general or whether he sees the general in the particular.\n The former produces allegory, where the particular has validity only\n\nas an example of the general; the latter, however, is the actual nature of\n\npoetry; it expresses the particular without thinking of the general or\n\nwithout pointing at it.\n He who grasps this particular vividly gets the general with it at the\n\nsame time without being aware of it, or only late.\n\n  As described by Goethe in the first two points, symbolism and\n\nallegory are related yet discrete modes of representation.\n Formed by coincidence of sensible appearance and supra-sensible\n\nmeaning, the symbol seeks to represent the ineffable and \" unrepresentable\"\n\nfrom within the confines of the concrete particular.\n The relationship of form and content in the symbol is indissoluble,\n\nnot to say that a particular form necessarily contains a specific content,\n\nbut that 'form' in general allows us access to the ineffable content which\n\nunintentionally appears in the 'vivid representation of the particular'.\n This unity of form and content endows the symbol with its perceived \"\n\nfullness\" and inexhaustibility.\n In contrast, allegory expresses a particular content which remains\n\nequally communicable through another instance of language or another form.\n At a fundamental level the relation of form and content in allegory\n\nis arbitrary.\n\n  As Goethe states, both modes negotiate between sensuous\n\nappearance (  Schein  ) and meaningful image ( \n\nBild  ) .\n Although both modes result in the creation of a meaningful image, the\n\ncontent of the ' 'maning' in each instance depends upon the nature of their\n\nmediation.\n\n\n  The concept, belonging strictly to reason, is opposed to the Idea\n\nin the symbol--we may suppose that the 'idea' is drawn by Kantian overtones\n\ntoward a global and 'intuitive' apprehension.\n This difference is important, and new: for the first time Goethe\n\naffirms that symbol and allegory do not have identical content, are not just\n\nvehicles for expressing 'the same thing'.\n\n  In the symbol this is accomplished by the relation of appearance\n\nand 'Idea', whereas allegory transforms appearance into image by way of a 'concept'.\n Because symbol and allegory undergo distinct mediations their content\n\nis non-identical.\n The Kantian 'Idea', \" representation of the imagination which induces\n\nmuch thought, yet without the possibility of any definite thought whatever,\n\ni.e.\n concept, being adequate to it, and which language, consequently, can\n\nnever get on level terms with or render completely intelligible,\" is given a\n\nprivileged position.\n The Idea is greater than the mere concept of rational understanding,\n\nbeing irreducible to it, and simultaneously 'above' language which fails to\n\nencompass it.\n The 'Idea' as represented in the symbol remains, following Goethe, 'infinitely\n\neffective and unreachable'; its complete comprehension is postponed or held\n\nout of reach of the subject.\n What is represented by the 'Idea' is more than mere phenomenological\n\nexperience.\n Schelling describes the symbol, \" as concrete, resembling only\n\nitself, like an image, and yet as universal and full of meaning as a\n\nconcept.?\n The unity of form and content, of appearance and Idea, comprises the\n\nontological nature of the symbol.\n Hegel, for all his criticism of Schelling, maintains this definition\n\nin his 1835 The Philosophy of Fine Arts:\n\n  Inasmuch, however, as it is the function of art to represent the\n\nidea to immediate vision in sensuous shape and not in the form of thought and\n\npure spirituality in the strict sense, and inasmuch as the value and\n\nintrinsic worth of this presentment consists of the correspondence and unity\n\nof the two aspects, that is the idea and its sensuous shape, the supreme\n\nlevel and excellence and the reality, which is truly consonant with its\n\nnotion, will depend upon the degree of intimacy and union which idea and\n\nconfiguration appear together in elaborated fusion.\n\n  In contrast, allegorical representation is easily delimited by\n\nthe content of its attendant concept.\n In his 1819 World as Will and Idea, Arthur Schopenhauer defined the\n\nobject constituted by the concept as, \" abstract, discursive...attainable and\n\ncomprehensible to him that has only reason, communicable by words without any\n\nother assistance, entirely exhausted by its definition.?\n The concept, although immanent in and coextensive with language, is\n\ncapable of operating without the threat of a loss of content.\n The medium of transmission is thus viewed as adequate to the task of\n\ncommunication.\n Be it in the realm of language or that of the visual, there is no\n\nremainder.\n Goethe 's allegorical 'concept', \" can be grasped and...had\n\ncompletely...in the image.\"\n\n  In the third part of his characterization Goethe writes: \" It is\n\na big difference whether the poet looks for the particular in the general or\n\nwhether he sees the general in the particular.?\n The literary critic and theorist Northrop Frye in Anatomy of\n\nCriticism summarized the distinction of symbol and allegory as, \" between a 'concrete'\n\napproach to symbols which begins with images of actual things and works\n\noutward to ideas and propositions, and 'abstract' approach which begins with\n\nthe idea and then tries to find concrete images to represent it.?\n Although Frye fails to maintain the critical use of the terms 'concept'\n\nand 'idea', his observation addresses an important issue in the relation of\n\nthe two modes to rational thought.\n The terms 'idea' and 'concept' correspond closely to the two modes of\n\nreason widely discussed in German thought after Kant.\n\n\nVernunft  ) , while the 'concept' is produced by the machinations\n\nof analytic reason ( Understanding, or  Verstand  ) .\n was a lower form of\n\ncognition, one that merely formed the phenomenal world into categories\n\ndeveloped in relation to 'common sense'.\n ) the phenomena\n\nand objects of the world appear as isolated entities, unrelated to one\n\nanother except by general characteristics.\n ) , however, is capable of\n\ncomprehending 'higher' relationships between the objects of common\n\nunderstanding, and for Hegel  Vernunft  was fundamentally\n\ndialectical.\n The symbol is thus found to be aligned with synthetic reason, a\n\nreason involved with the reconciliation and sublation (  Aufgehoben\n\n ) of antithetical conceptual pairs, or contradictory elements\n\nwithin a greater totality.\n\n\n  The logical has in point of form three sides...These three sides\n\ndo not constitute three parts of the Logic, but are moments of each logical\n\nreality, that is of each concept...a) Thought, as the Understanding, sticks\n\nto finite determinacies and their distinctness from one another...b) The\n\ndialectical moment of the self-sublation of such finite determinations and\n\ntheir transition into their opposites...c) The speculative moment, or that of\n\npositive Reason, apprehends the unity of the determinations in their\n\nopposition--the affirmative that is contained in their dissolution and\n\ntransition.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "eb6cfaf8-1d37-4647-b390-0bf190bb0138", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.886681+00:00"}

He worked with women every\n\nday.\n No, what really galled her was the thought of this other woman, well-\n\ndressed, confident, successful, knowing something intimate about their\n\nmarriage while Sue whistled away in her fool 's paradise.\n She could imagine the show of sympathy and concern this hard-nosed,\n\ncorporate-climbing career woman had displayed while to herself she laughed at\n\nthe pathetic wife, off somewhere blissfully ignorant, powerless, forgotten.\n\n\n\n  Frank kept on blathering: \" She said, 'Well, you have to find it,\n\nthat 's all there is to it.' \" \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \" Dinner,\" said Frank.\n \" And I went straight back to my room and searched high and low.\n I even went back to the bar where I had stopped for a cocktail that\n\nevening, and also the hotel restaurant.\n Nada.\n Of course, my room had been cleaned by then.\n I figured that if housekeeping had gotten hold of it, good luck ever\n\nseeing that ring again.\" \n\n  Good old Frank.\n When his pal Stan got caught cheating the IRS and went to that\n\ncountry club prison upstate, Frank had been really pissed.\n But when it came to hired help, they weren't to be trusted.\n To hear Frank, you'd think 'dhe blue collar of the world were just\n\nwaiting to steal the dirt out from under your fingernails, though there'd be\n\n'dlim pickings from Frank in that department. \n\n  \" So that 's it?\" said Sue as they pulled onto the northbound\n\nturnpike.\n The snow was coming down harder and cars had begun to slow down.\n The landscape had begun to take on a steely gray aspect, and the\n\nmirror-like slickness of the pavement reflected the red tail lights of\n\nthousands of commuters headed home. \n\n  \" What else can I say, honey?\n You know how much that ring meant to me.\n\n\n  He had dropped the managerial tone now and fallen back on his old\n\nstandby Mr. Charm voice that he had always used to such advantage, especially\n\nwith Sue.\n\n\n  \" But you did lose it.\n\n\n  \" What do you want me to do?\" said Frank.\n \" I'm sorry, okay?\n<I 'm-USA:#72:1> I lost the ring.\n I didn't want to lose it.\n It just happened.\n\n\n  Case closed.\n Debit recorded in the unrecoverable loss column.\n Dead letter file.\n Sue opened her mouth, then closed it again.\n What more could she say?\n\n\n  \" Good thing we'll be ho 'llbefore the snow gets bad,\" said Frank\n\nwith forced cheerfulness.\n\n\n  \" You're not drivin 'reFrank.\n I am,\" said Sue flatly.\n\n\n  Lately, Sue had acquired the habit of waking in the middle of the\n\nnight and wandering around the house poking into this and that, doing nothing\n\nin particular.\n She told herself that she delighted in the pleasant perversity of\n\nbeing awake when the rest of the world slept, but the truth was she felt more\n\ncomfortable and secure in the wee hours.\n Sue found herself increasingly overwhelmed with the small things in\n\nlife.\n She felt that she literally had to hold on for dear life as the Earth\n\ncareened through space.\n When the world was quiet and still and asleep, at those times and\n\nthose times alone, Sue felt like she was in control of something, that the\n\nprogress of time was slowed down to a speed she could manage. \n\n  Also, the big modern house that Frank had insisted on buying over\n\nher objections seemed cold to the point of being alien during the day.\n ( She would have preferred something more Victorian that she could\n\ndecorate with baskets of potpourri, stencilled wall paper and lots of duck\n\ndecoys and antiques.) But at night the house seemed softer and more\n\ncomfortable. \n\n  She poured a glass of red wine and wandered into the study and\n\nlooked until she found the photo album that had the pictures of her wedding.\n She took this into the living room, set her wine on the glass coffee\n\ntable and burrowed down into the deep cushions of their sectional sofa. \n\n  Had it been ten years already?\n Of course, she had gained some weight.\n How could she not?\n Sitting around the house all day.\n Oh, well she kept busy enough between volunteering at the library,\n\nchurch activities, and with her friends.\n But there was no real need to work.\n Frank had discouraged it, in fact, not because he didn't feel it was\n\nproper but because it screwed up their income tax bracket or something. \n\n  She never had thought she would be a housewife.\n She always dreaded the thought of that.\n When she met Frank she had just gone back to school to work on a\n\nmasters in psychology, but she never finished.\n Before that, she worked at a number of odd jobs that never seemed to\n\namount to anything. \n\n  She found herself wishing idly for children, but the day for\n\nthat had also come and gone.\n She married Frank when she was in her early thirties.\n There was still time then, and they talked about it often, but the\n\ntime never seemed to be right and year had followed year and here she was in\n\nher early forties.\n Technically, she could still consider the possibility, but in truth,\n\nthe idea had stopped appealing to her the way it once did.\n If things seemed too complicated without kids, what would it be like\n\nwith?\n Anyway, she didn't want to be sixty with a child in high school.\n\n\n\n  As she stared one by one at the pictures, a thought began to\n\npresent itself.\n Not a new thought to her, but expressed with more clarity and force\n\nthan before: it wasn't supposed to be this way.\n She had agreed to a different set of conditions ten years before.\n She had signed onto a different agenda.\n Frank was a business major who was going to make enough to keep them\n\nfed and clothed and spend the rest of his time playing bass with a rock and\n\nroll band that he and his friends kept trying to start.\n That dream lasted exactly one month and one gig and then fell to\n\npieces when Interworld had called and recruited him straight from college.\n\n\n\n  \" Still up?\" said Frank from the hall door.\n He stood in his pajamas and robe, well-dressed even in the middle of\n\nthe night.\n He squinted into the lighted room, his eyes adjusting to the light.\n\n\n\n  \" Up again,\" Sue answered.\n She took a sip of the wine.\n The crystal was cold against her lips, but the wine felt round and\n\nwarm as it rolled across her tongue.\n She expected Frank would turn and go back to bed, but instead he\n\ncrossed the white pile carpet and settled beside her on the sofa.\n Why did he seem to be growing thinner over the years as she grew\n\nmore plump?\n\n\n \n\n  \" Oh, it 's okay.\n\n\n  \" No you didn't.\n\n\n  \" Let 's not talk about it anymore,\" she said.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  He looked surprised.\n\n\n  \" Nowhere in particular.\n Everywhere.\n Don't you remember when we used to talk about driving across the\n\ncountry?\n Let 's do it now.\n We could go down south.\n I've never b 've down there.\n It 's slower and calmer there.\n We won't take any interstates, just country roads.\n We'll 'llp at every general store and main street diner we come to.\n We'll 'llz into each town, buy postcards and buzz out.\n We'll 'lly in tacky tourist courts and stop at the historical\n\nmarkers.\n We'll 'llto McDonald 's and buy two coffees, fill up the thermos and\n\nthen get refills for the road.\" \n\n  Sue became animated as she talked, but Frank just forced a thin\n\nhalf smile and said, \" You're 'reding, right?\" \n\n  \" No,\" said Sue, shaking her head.\n\n\n  \" But, honey.\n I have a job.\n I couldn't just walk out.\n I have appointments.\n I have at least ten clients coming in this week.\n I' 'dlove to take a vacation.\n Really.\n How about next summer?\n I'l 'llut in a leave request now.\n\n\n  Sue nodded and took another sip from her wine.\n For no good reason, she felt a sudden and overwhelming urge to ask\n\nher husband if he had slept with anyone else since they were married.\n She fought down the urge.\n Partly because she had made a promise to herself years before that\n\nshe would never ask.\n Partly because she knew the answer would depress her no matter what\n\nit was.\n But mostly she realized that to even want to ask the question at all\n\nmeant that some profound circumstance had changed in a way that made the\n\nanswer irrelevant. \n\n  She nodded again and said, \" Yeah, maybe in the summer.\n\n\n  The next morning, after Sue had dropped Frank at the station to\n\njoin the other commuters who stood hunched in their long, thick clothes on\n\nthe platform, their breath turning into tiny clouds in the frozen air, she\n\nwent home and packed an overnight bag. \n\n  She made a pot of coffee and took it to the kitchen table.\n She gathered up paper and a pen and sat at the table under a heart\n\ncarved in the high-backed, Dutch-style bench, the most old-fashioned\n\nfurnishing in the house and her favorite place to sit.\n She drank coffee and wrote a note to Frank.\n She wrote that she was leaving and taking the car.\n He 'd get along without it and seldom drove it anyway.\n She also wrote that she would probably be back, though as she did,\n\nshe wondered if this were true.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "12ce13a2-c1ca-440a-97c2-fdd174e9af64", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.888326+00:00"}
{"text": "<P>  This paper presents the findings of an empirical study into two\n\norganizations' experiences with the adoption and use of CASE tools over time.\n\n Using a grounded theory research approach, the study characterizes the\n\norganizations' experiences in terms of processes of incremental or radical\n\norganizational change.\n These findings are used to develop a theoretical framework for\n\nconceptualizing the organizational issues around the adoption and use of\n\nthese tools--issues that have been largely missing from contemporary\n\ndiscussions of CASE tools.\n The paper thus has important implications for research and practice.\n Specifically, the framework and findings suggest that in order to\n\naccount for the experiences and outcomes associated with CASE tools,\n\nresearchers should consider the social context of systems development, the\n\nintentions and actions of key players, and the implementation process\n\nfollowed by the organization.\n Similarly, the paper suggests that practitioners will be better able\n\nto manage their organizations' experiences with CASE tools, if they\n\nunderstand that such implementations involve a process of organizational\n\nchange over time, and not merely the installation of a new technology.\n\n\n<P>  CASE ( computer-aided software engineering) tools have generated\n\nmuch interest among researchers and practitioners as potential means for\n\neasing the software development and maintenance burden threatening to\n\noverwhelm information systems ( IS) departments.\n While interest and investment in CASE tools has been rising steadily,\n\nactual experiences with tools have exhibited more ambiguity.\n For example, while some studies report improvements in productivity\n\nfrom the use of CASE tools ( Banker and Kauffman, 1991; Necco, Tsai and\n\nHolgeson, 1989; Norman and Nunamaker, 1988; Swanson, McComb, Smith, and\n\nMcCubbrey, 1991), others find that the expected productivity gains are\n\nelusive ( Card, McGarry, and Page, 1987; Yellen,1990) or eclipsed by lack of\n\nadequate training and experience, developer resistance, and increased design\n\nand testing time ( Norman, Corbitt, Butler, and McElroy, 1989; Orlikowski,\n\n1988b, 1989; Vessey, Jarvenpaa, and Tractinsky, 1992).\n\n<P>  While these contradictory experiences with CASE tools appear\n\npuzzling and difficult to interpret, the research presented here suggests\n\nthat by shifting the focus from specific outcome expectations, we may be able\n\nto make some sense of the apparently inconsistent findings.\n This paper argues that the adoption and use of CASE tools should be\n\nconceptualized as a form of organizational change, and that such a\n\nperspective allows us to anticipate, explain, and evaluate different\n\nexperiences and consequences following the introduction of CASE tools in\n\norganizations. To date, there has been no systematic examination or\n\nformulation of the organizational changes around CASE tools.\n Much of the literature on CASE tools has tended to focus on discrete\n\noutcomes, such as productivity, systems quality, and development costs, while\n\nneglecting the intentions and actions of key players, the process by which\n\nCASE tools are adopted and used, and the organizational context within which\n\nsuch events occur.\n Issues of intentions, actions, process, and context around\n\ninformation technology are not new to the IS field.\n For example, implementation research has looked at the process\n\nthrough which technology is introduced ( Ginzberg, 1981; Rogers, 1983), the\n\ninteractionist ( Markus, 1983) and reinforcement politics ( George and King,\n\n1991) approaches have examined the role of social context in shaping the\n\nintroduction and use of technology, and the structuration perspective (\n\nDeSanctis and Poole, forthcoming; Orlikowski and Robey, 1991) has emphasized\n\nthe centrality of players' deliberate, knowledgeable, and reflective action\n\nin shaping and appropriating technology.\n Yet, contemporary discussions around CASE tools in research,\n\neducation, and practice tend to gloss over these issues. In this paper, the\n\nimplementation of CASE tools is understood as a specific case of\n\ntechnology-based organizational change.\n As such, the core research question is: What are the critical\n\nelements that shape the organizational changes associated with the adoption\n\nand use of CASE tools? In answering this question, I first describe the\n\nempirical findings that emerged from my grounded theory study of two\n\norganizations that implemented CASE tools in their systems development\n\noperations.\n I then develop a theoretical framework that conceptualizes the\n\nfindings in terms of three central categories: strategic conduct,\n\ninstitutional context, and change process.\n\n<P>  The grounded theory approach was useful here because it allows a\n\nfocus on contextual and processual elements as well as the action of key\n\nplayers associated with organizational change--elements that are often\n\nomitted in IS studies that rely on variance models and cross-sectional,\n\nquantitative data ( Markus and Robey, 1988; Orlikowski and Baroudi, 1991).\n While the findings of this grounded theory study are detailed and\n\nparticularistic, a more general explanation can also be produced from the\n\nresults ( Eisenhardt, 1989; Dutton and Dukerich, 1991; Leonard-Barton, 1990).\n Yin ( 1989a) refers to this technique as \" analytic generalization\"\n\nto distinguish it from the more typical statistical generalization that\n\ngeneralizes from a sample to a population.\n Here the generalization is of theoretical concepts and patterns.\n I further extend this generalization by combining the inductive\n\nconcepts generated by the field study with insights from existing formal\n\ntheory, in this case, from the innovation literature ( a strategy recommended\n\nby Glaser and Strauss, 1967).\n The outcome is a general conceptualization of the organizational\n\nchanges associated with adopting and using CASE tools that both contributes\n\nto our research knowledge and informs IS practice.\n\n<P>  The paper makes three principal contributions.\n First, drawing on the rich data of two organizations' experiences,\n\nthe paper generates a grounded understanding of the changes associated with\n\nimplementing CASE tools in systems development.\n This grounded theory is valid empirically \" because the\n\ntheory-building process is so intimately tied with evidence that it is very\n\nlikely that the resultant theory will be consistent with empirical\n\nobservation\" ( Eisenhardt, 1989, p.\n 547).\n While many believe that building theory from a limited number of\n\ncases is susceptible to researchers' preconceptions, Eisenhardt ( 1988)\n\nargues persuasively that the opposite is true.\n The iterative comparison across sites, methods, evidence, and\n\nliterature that characterizes such research leads to a \" constant\n\njuxtaposition of conflicting realities [ that] tends to \" unfreeze\" thinking,\n\nand so the process has the potential to generate theory with less researcher\n\nbias than theory built from incremental studies or armchair, axiomatic\n\ndeduction\" ( p.\n 546).\n Second, the grounded theory developed in this paper adds substantive\n\ncontent to our understanding of the central role played by individual actors,\n\ntheir institutional context, and the processes they enact in adopting and\n\nusing CASE tools.\n Such an understanding has been absent from the research and practice\n\ndiscourses on CASE tools.\n The approach followed here focuses specifically on developing such an\n\nunderstanding, thus bringing a fresh set of issues to the already-researched\n\ntopic of CASE tools ( Eisenhardt, 1989).\n Third, the paper integrates a specific grounded theory with the more\n\nformal insights available from the innovation literature, developing a more\n\ngeneral framework that will allow researchers and practitioners to explain,\n\nanticipate, and evaluate various organizational changes associated with the\n\nadoption and use of CASE tools.\n\n<P>  The paper is structured as follows.\n The first section describes the research methodology and the two\n\nresearch sites.\n The next section presents the research findings, describing the\n\nexperiences of each organization in turn.\n The discussion section follows, integrating the specific concepts and\n\nfindings of the field research with insights from the innovation literature\n\ninto an analytic framework for conceptualizing CASE tools adoption and use in\n\norganizations.\n The conclusion then assesses the contribution of the research\n\nframework and findings, both for future research and for the management of\n\nCASE tools in organizations.\n\n\n<P>  The research methodology followed was that of grounded theory (\n\nGlaser and Strauss, 1967; Martin and Turner, 1986; Turner, 1983), with an aim\n\nof generating a descriptive and explanatory theory of the organizational\n\nchanges associated with CASE tools rooted in the experiences of specific\n\nsystems development operations.\n This approach has been effectively used in organizational research (\n\nAncona, 1990; Elsbach and Sutton, 1992; Isabella, 1990; Kahn, 1990;\n\nPettigrew, 1990; Sutton, 1987), and was adopted here for three primary\n\nreasons.\n\n<P>  First, grounded theory \" is an inductive, theory discovery\n\nmethodology that allows the researcher to develop a theoretical account of\n\nthe general features of a topic while simultaneously grounding the account in\n\nempirical observations or data\" ( Martin and Turner, 1986, p.\n 141).\n This generative approach seemed particularly useful here given that\n\nno change theory of CASE tools adoption and use has been established to date.\n While models of information technology implementation do exist (\n\nGinzberg, 1981; Lucas, 1978; Markus, 1983) these deal largely with the\n\ndevelopment stages of IS implementation and focus extensively on user\n\ninvolvement and user relations.\n As a result, they are less applicable to the issue of organizational\n\nchange in general, and to the case of CASE tools adoption and use in\n\nparticular.\n\n<P>  Second, a major premise of grounded theory is that to produce\n\naccurate and useful results, the complexities of the organizational context\n\nhave to be incorporated into an understanding of the phenomenon, rather than\n\nbe simplified or ignored ( Martin and Turner, 1986; Pettigrew, 1990).\n As indicated above, a number of theoretical approaches emphasize the\n\ncriticality of organizational context in shaping technology use in\n\norganizations.\n Such a conviction also informs this research, and the use of a\n\ngrounded theory methodology allowed the inclusion and investigation of this\n\nkey organizational element.\n\n<P>  Third, grounded theory facilitates \" the generation of theories\n\nof process, sequence, and change pertaining to organizations, positions, and\n\nsocial interaction\" ( Glaser and Strauss, 1967, p.\n 114).\n As indicated above, the change an organization undergoes in adopting\n\nand assimilating CASE tools, and the processes of appropriation and use that\n\nsystem developers engage in to incorporate the tools in their work lives have\n\ntended to be neglected in the CASE tools literature.\n A research approach that specifically includes elements of process\n\nand change was thus particularly appropriate here.\n\n<P>  These three characteristics of grounded theory--inductive,\n\ncontextual, and processual--fit with the interpretive rather than positivist\n\norientation of this research.\n The focus here is on developing a context-based, process-oriented\n\ndescription and explanation of the phenomenon, rather than an objective,\n\nstatic description expressed strictly in terms of causality ( Boland, 1979,\n\n1985; Chua, 1986; Orlikowski and Baroudi, 1991).\n In the language of Markus and Robey ( 1988) and Mohr ( 1982), the\n\npaper develops a process not a variance theory.\n Such a theory describes and explains the process of adopting and\n\nusing CASE tools in terms of an interaction of contextual conditions,\n\nactions, and consequences, rather than explaining variance using independent\n\nand dependent variables ( Elsbach and Sutton, 1992).\n This orientation \" gives primacy to realism of context and\n\ntheoretical and conceptual development as research goals\" ( Pettigrew, 1990,\n\np.\n\n\n<P>  The methodology of grounded theory is iterative, requiring a\n\nsteady movement between concept and data, as well as comparative, requiring a\n\nconstant comparison across types of evidence to control the conceptual level\n\nand scope of the emerging theory.\n As Pettigrew ( 1989) notes, this \" provides an opportunity to examine\n\ncontinuous processes in context in order to draw out the significance of\n\nvarious levels of analysis and thereby reveal the multiple sources of loops\n\nof causation and connectivity so crucial to identifying and explaining\n\npatterns in the process of change\" ( p.\n 14).\n To facilitate this iteration and comparison, two field sites were\n\nstudied and analyzed in turn, a strategy also adopted by Kahn ( 1990).\n The initial concepts thus emerged in one organizational context, and\n\nwere then contrasted, elaborated, and qualified in the other.\n\n\n<P>  Following Glaser and Strauss' ( 1967) technique of theoretical\n\nsampling, the two organizations were selected for their similarities as well\n\nas their differences.\n Theoretical sampling requires paying attention to theoretical\n\nrelevance and purpose.\n With respect to relevance, this selection process ensures that the\n\nsubstantive area addressed--here, the adoption and use of CASE tools--is kept\n\nsimilar, or as Eisenhardt ( 1988) notes, \" is likely to replicate or extend\n\nthe emergent theory\" ( p.\n 537).\n Thus, both organizations chosen for this study had within the past\n\nfew years implemented CASE tools into their systems development operations,\n\nand mandated their use on all new systems development work.\n In addition, the CASE tools themselves, while not identical, were\n\ncompatible across the two organizations in that both were life-cycle tools\n\nthat integrate the phases of analysis, design, coding, and testing.1 Both\n\nsets of tools provide similar capabilities such as design aids ( e.g., data\n\nflow diagrams), data modeling facilities ( e.g., entity-relationship\n\nmodeling), screen and report design utilities, data repositories, code\n\ngenerators, test data generation, and version control.\n While the one set of CASE tools are based on the Structured Systems\n\nDesign approach ( Yourdon and Constantine, 1978), the other is based on\n\nInformation Engineering ( Martin, 1990a, 1990b, 1990c).\n Thus, the two sets of CASE tools are philosophically similar, drawing\n\non the same basic software engineering tenets of functional decomposition,\n\nseparation of process and data, and sequential development phases.\n\n<P>  Because the purpose of the research was to generate theory\n\napplicable to various organizational contexts and distinguishing different\n\nchange processes, differences were sought in organizational conditions such\n\nas the nature and scope of systems development activity and the method of\n\nCASE tools acquisition.\n As a result, the two companies selected also differ on other\n\norganizational dimensions such as industry, location, size, structure, and\n\nculture.\n The consulting firm ( SCC)3 is in the software business, developing\n\ninformation systems for external clients.\n In 1987, it employed 13,000 consultants and earned\n\n&dollar;600 million in revenues.\n SCC acquired its CASE tools by developing them in-house.\n The petro-chemical firm ( PCC) is in the petroleum products business,\n\nhaving earned\n\n&dollar;6.3 billion in revenues in 1987.\n It has an internal information systems division, which employs 320\n\npeople and which develops and maintains information systems for internal\n\nbusiness units.\n PCC acquired its CASE tools by purchasing them from an outside\n\nvendor.\n These differences in organizational conditions allowed useful\n\ncontrasts to be made during data analysis, which challenged and elaborated\n\nthe emerging concepts.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "866bba63-c21c-41a8-a846-cfb48da9c836", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.889796+00:00"}
{"text": "If walking quickly is too uncomfortable for you as a fitness\n\nprogram, consider learning how to hike.\n Hiking allows you to opt for longer walks at a more moderate pace.\n In terms of energy costs, a day-long hike up hills and down winding\n\npaths is similar to running a marathon.\n But when it comes to taking in the sights, smells, and sounds as you\n\ngo, hiking is tough to beat.\n\n  Where you choose to hike will depend, in part, on your interests.\n If you enjoy watching birds, for example, you may want to pack your\n\nbinoculars and head for a swampy area like the Everglades National Park,\n\nwhich is known for its ornithological richness.\n If you're interested in plant life, you ma 'reant to plan a spring or\n\nsummer hike in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where you'll find a\n\n'llrilliant display of rhododendrons and azaleas.\n If you just want to get out into nature, you may want to join the 20\n\nmillion hikers and backpackers who put the national and state parks to good\n\nuse each year. \n\n  Chances are you'll find a n 'llonal, state, or local park in your\n\narea that offers scenic trails for hiking.\n Trail maps are often available to guide you; some show estimates of\n\nmileage and may indicate the degree of difficulty of the trails.\n Even if you live in an urban area, you'll probably 'll able to find\n\nforest or wildlife preserves nearby that you can roam for a few hours.\n It 's a healthy and inexpensive way to escape the noise and traffic of\n\nthe city.\n It 's also a good way to prepare your body for lengthier hikes across\n\nrougher terrain. \n\n  Your state board of tourism may be able to provide you with\n\ninformation about state and local parks.\n Local chapters of hiking groups and environmental organizations may\n\nalso be able to assist you.\n To find out more about national parks in your area, contact the\n\nNational Park Service.\n This article has essential information for learning how to hike,\n\nincluding how to prepare for a hike, what to wear, what to pack, and how to\n\nstay safe.\n First, let 's look at how you should prepare for a hike.\n\n\n\n  Before you head out on the wilderness trail, you'll need 'll\n\nprepare yourself for the greater intensity of hiking.\n Once you've completed the Starter and Basic Walki 'vePrograms, you\n\nshould be able to walk comfortably on level ground for four or five miles at\n\na time.\n Rarely will you find a hiking path that 's smooth and level.\n So you'll need 'll condition your body for tackling hilly terrain.\n To do this, choose a four- or five-mile route near your home that has\n\nplenty of inclines.\n Since walking up and down inclines takes more energy than walking on\n\nlevel ground, you may have to begin at a pace that 's slightly slower than\n\nyour usual walking speed.\n Walk the entire length of this route three or four times a week for\n\nseveral weeks, until you can manage it comfortably at a moderate pace. \n\n  Your next step is to practice walking on hilly terrain with\n\nweight on your back.\n Even if you'll be 'llcking to short day hikes, you'll pro 'llly need\n\nto carry a few things with you.\n So fill your hiking pack with items you're likely to take, incl 'reng\n\na filled water bottle or two, a small first-aid kit, insect repellent and/or\n\nsunscreen, a raincoat or poncho, a sweatshirt, and some snacks.\n Then walk that four- or five-mile hilly stretch a few times a week\n\nfor several weeks while carrying your filled pack. \n\n  Once you've completed this round of conditi 'veng, you should be\n\nready for a day hike.\n You'll nee 'llo successfully complete a few day hikes - - and practice\n\nwalking with a heavier pack - - before you'll be 'lldy for an overnight trip.\n For your first hike, choose a well-marked trail that you can cover at\n\na moderate pace in less than a day.\n As you hike, choose a comfortable pace.\n You'll be 'llking for several hours, so don't race through the first\n\nmile.\n Be sure to give yourself rest stops, too.\n You may want to try stopping for about ten minutes each hour.\n More frequent breaks may cause you to lose momentum.\n If you absolutely need to rest a little more often, however, by all\n\nmeans do. \n\n  Take advantage of the information in the next section to make\n\nsure you dress appropriately for your hike.\n You'll als 'lleed a sturdy, comfortable pair of hiking boots or\n\nwalking shoes designed for off-road terrain.\n Be sure to break them in gradually by wearing them around the house\n\nbefore you take them on the road.\n Invest in a good pair of socks to protect your feet from blisters.\n Nicely padded Orlon socks or wool socks with nylon liners work well.\n Get more preparation tips by reading the next section of this\n\narticle.\n\n\n\n  Use these guidelines to determine what to pack for your hike.\n The first item on your list of things to carry is water, even if\n\nyou're taking a short h 're.\n It 's all too easy to become dehydrated during a hike, especially in\n\nwarm weather.\n So you'll ne 'llto drink plenty of water as you go, even if you don't\n\nfeel particularly thirsty.\n You can't count on finding drinkable water along your route, so\n\nyou'll ne 'llto carry enough for your entire hike.\n If you're planning a sh 're hike, you may be able to get away with one\n\nbottle of water.\n For longer hikes, try filling three or four containers so that you\n\ncan distribute the weight evenly in your pack. \n\n  The next item on the list is food.\n Hiking takes a lot of energy - - at least 300 calories an hour ( more\n\nif you're hiking at a b 'rek pace or on rugged or uphill terrain).\n Even if you eat an extra-large breakfast before you begin, you're\n\nlikely to 're hungry on the trail.\n Because you'll pr 'llbly have to carry all the food you'll ne 'll try\n\nto choose foods that are nourishing yet low in weight and bulk - - and easy\n\nto prepare in advance.\n Particularly in hot weather, avoid bringing perishable foods, such as\n\nmilk products and raw meat, that can spoil easily. \n\n  Sandwiches as well as snacks of nuts, dried fruits, and dry\n\ncereal are favorite choices.\n They'll pr 'llde you with the carbohydrates you need for energy.\n A variety of dehydrated foods are also available, but these require\n\nwater to make them edible.\n Another essential item is a small first aid kit.\n This kit should contain bandages or sterile pads and tape,\n\nantiseptic, and aspirin or another painkiller.\n In addition, you may want to carry a pocket knife or a small pair of\n\nscissors, matches, a small flashlight, biodegradable toilet paper, insect\n\nrepellent, and a good sunscreen.\n You may also want to bring a compass along.\n\n\n  To carry all these items, you'll ne 'lla pack.\n The type you choose depends on the length of the hikes you intend to\n\ntake.\n If you plan on taking short hikes, a fanny pack or day pack should be\n\nlarge enough.\n If you go on overnight hikes, however, you'll ne 'lla backpack that 's\n\na little roomier.\n Packs come in a variety of models, sizes, materials, and colors.\n Some have internal frames, others have external frames.\n To find a pack that 's right for you, visit a sporting goods store or\n\noutdoor gear store that has knowledgeable salespeople.\n Discuss with them the type of hiking you'll 'lldoing, the supplies\n\nyou plan to carry, and the amount of money you're willi 'reto spend. \n\n  Be sure, however, to try the pack on before you purchase it.\n You'll 'llthe one carrying it around, so you'll 'llt it to suit your\n\nbody frame and feel comfortable.\n The pack should conform to your back.\n It should also have adjustable, padded shoulder straps and an\n\nadjustable waist belt that will allow you to distribute the weight of the\n\npack to your hips as well as to your shoulders.\n Once you've taken sev 'vel day hikes, you may want to try an overnight\n\nhiking or backpacking trip.\n For these trips, you'll 'lld to carry more supplies, including extra\n\nfood and water, a sleeping bag, a powerful flashlight, a change of clothes,\n\nand perhaps even a tent and a small camping stove.\n\n\n  Government researchers have found that carrying more than 25\n\npounds of weight for long periods can do more harm than good by straining the\n\nshoulders, back, and knees.\n This research grew out of complaints from soldiers who had to carry\n\nheavy packs during long marches.\n So it may be best to limit the load you carry on a hiking trip to 25\n\npounds, if it 's at all possible.To cut down on weight, try choosing\n\nnourishing foods that don't need to be cooked, so you won't have to carry\n\ncooking utensils.\n If you're p 'rehasing a sleeping bag, tent, stove, or other equipment,\n\nchoose lightweight models. \n\n  You know that a first-aid kit is an essential safety item to take\n\nalong on your hike, but there are other ways to protect yourself from harm\n\nwhile hiking.\n\n\n\n  There are several safety issues associated with hiking.\n Part of the pleasure of hiking is the opportunity it gives you to\n\nexplore wild areas and experience the wonders of nature.\n Even if you're h 'reng a trail for the second time around, you'll 'll\ndiscover many new sights and sounds.\n But you can prevent some unpleasant surprises by taking a few\n\nprecautions on the trail.\n As a general safety precaution, it 's best to walk with a companion,\n\nespecially on long treks.\n Before you venture out, it 's also wise to let someone at home know\n\nwhere you'r 'reoing, which trail you intend to follow, and when you intend to\n\nreturn.\n\n  When you'r 'ren the trail, avoid drinking water directly from\n\nsprings, streams, or lakes.\n No matter how clean and clear it looks, the water may be contaminated\n\nwith a host of parasites and bacteria introduced by people or animals\n\nupstream.\n Boiling the water for at least one minute may help destroy some of\n\nthese organisms.\n Portable water treatment kits are also available to help you purify\n\nwater in an emergency.\n However, the best way to avoid illness from contaminated water is to\n\npack and carry your own drinking water.\n\n Poisonous plants are another trailside hazard.\n To guard against getting rashes from poison ivy, poison oak, and\n\npoison sumac, wear clothing that covers as much exposed skin as possible,\n\nparticularly on the feet and legs.\n Wear long pants, socks, and shoes or boots.\n When you return home from a hike, remove your hiking outfit and toss\n\nit in the washing machine.\n Use care when removing your hiking boots or shoes: The plant oil\n\nthat triggers the rash can easily stick to the bottom or sides of your boot\n\nwhere it has come into contact with one of the offending plants.\n So try to remove your footwear without handling those areas, or you\n\ncould inadvertently touch the lingering oil, spread it to your face or other\n\nparts of your body, and end up with a nasty rash even after you've 'vet the\n\nwoods.\n If you do develop a rash from one of these plants, try applying an\n\nover-the-counter remedy, such as calamine lotion, to relieve itching. \n\n  Don't panic if you've 'ven bitten by a tick.\n Not all ticks carry Lyme disease - - a tick-borne illness that can\n\ncause chills, fever, headache, and other serious complications.\n Generally, a tick must remain on the skin for 24 to 48 hours in\n\norder to transmit the organism that causes Lyme disease.\n If you remove a tick from your skin, save it in a small container of\n\nalcohol, so that if a suspicious infection develops, the tick can be analyzed\n\nfor Lyme disease.\n There is no need to see a doctor for a tick bite unless you notice\n\nany signs of swelling or redness around the bite ( a sign of infection), a\n\nbull 's-eye-shaped rash ( often a symptom of Lyme disease), a fever, or a skin\n\nrash. \n\n  If you' 'regoing on an overnight trip in the wilderness, you can\n\nprotect your food - - and yourself - - from wild animals by stringing your\n\nfood up at night.\n Place all food, as well as toothpaste, lotion, and other\n\npleasant-smelling items, in a corded bag or your pack.\n Then string the bundle up high between two trees.\n If you 'll be hiking in an area that isn't off-limits to hunters, be\n\nsure to wear something bright, especially during hunting season.\n Orange caps are very popular for this purpose and are available in\n\nwaterproof and breathable materials.\n Finally, before you head out, be sure to do research on how to\n\nprevent conditions like heatstroke, frostbite, and dehydration while you 're\n\non the trail.\n Combine that with the information in this article to make your\n\nhiking experience pleasant and problem-free.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "747ad13f-67ea-4190-a26a-c112501326ea",

{"text": "It is a fatal assumption to ascribe these calamities exclusively\n\nto the errors and infirmities of the Irish character; and set about\n\nalternately coercing and cajoling, as if it were a child or a maniac we had\n\nto deal with.\n No empire has ever yet treated a whole section of its subjects as\n\ninferior in heart and mind without incurring the condemnation of posterity. (\n\n2)\n\n  This question of race is the very last topic that English writers\n\nand politicians should have broached. . .\n The fallacy of referring Irish evils to Celtic causation, is one very\n\nlikely to be wiped off in blood. ( 3)\n\n  The 150th anniversary of the Irish potato famine in autumn 1996 is\n\nalready stirring a highly emotional reappraisal of the history of English\n\ntreatment of Ireland.\n The belief that the racist English refused substantial famine relief\n\nto Ireland because of their hatred for the Celtic race is widespread both\n\nwithin and outside the scholarly community.\n Recent demands by the Irish Republic for an official British \"\n\napology\" for the famine reflect this belief, which sometimes extends to the\n\nassertion that the English sought to perpetrate racial genocide by\n\nengineering mass starvation in Ireland.\n This understanding of the famine poisons English-Irish relations to\n\nthis day, just as memories of 1641 or 1798 stirred anger and bitterness in\n\nthe Victorian period.\n\n  Lewis Perry Curtis, Jr. is the most prominent of many historians\n\nwho conclude that race was the defining element in nineteenth-century English\n\nperceptions of the Irish.\n The English, according to Curtis and others, looked with a\n\nself-conscious sense of Saxon superiority at what they considered to be a\n\nchildlike and inferior but dangerous Celtic race.\n This attitude, it is assumed, shaped policy and lay at the root of\n\nIrish oppression.\n Irish nationalist historians have used these arguments to place their\n\npeople among other victims of colonial racism and genocide in Africa, Asia\n\nand North America. ( 4)\n Anti-Irish racism in this sense appears as an inevitable\n\nmanifestation of colonialism.\n\n  It is easy to forget, however, that prejudice takes many forms,\n\nnot all of them based on a concrete conception of the victim as a\n\nbiologically distinct race.\n Those who forget this fact have trouble interpreting English policy\n\ntoward Ireland in the 1840s.\n Some writers misjudge, for example, the motivations behind the\n\ninsistence of many Englishmen in the early famine period that Celt and Saxon\n\nand even Protestant and Catholic were fundamentally equal.\n Liz Curtis hails John Stuart Mill, who repeatedly rejected the notion\n\nthat the Irish were racially inferior, as one of the few Englishmen who\n\nunderstood the true nature of \" British exploitation\" of Ireland. ( 5)\n\n\n  We must give over telling the Irish that it is our business to\n\nfind food for them.\n We must tell them, now and forever, that it is their business. (\n\n6)\n\n  K.D.M.\n Snell sees Alexander Somerville 's lack of religious or racial bigotry\n\nas evidence that Somerville was not \" prejudiced\" against the Irish. ( 7)\n Yet Somerville also wrote in early 1847 that the starving Irish were\n\nwillingly foregoing food and using English charity money to buy arms, and\n\nthat continuing to give them relief would only \" make the people think that\n\nthe government should do everything.\"(8)\n\n  British perceptions of the Irish in the 1840s were more complex\n\nthan they may at first appear.\n During the first months of the crisis, advocates of the tight-fisted\n\ngovernment policy drew on what may be called a Liberal discourse of moral\n\nimprovement which explicitly denied the racial inferiority of the Irish and\n\nsaw the famine as a Providential opportunity to civilize and improve them.\n The Liberal understanding of human nature gave the great majority of\n\nthe public confidence that Irish degradation was moral and not biological in\n\nnature, and thus subject to change.\n Forcing the Irish to fend for themselves in time of dearth thus\n\nappeared as a useful and necessary moral lesson for a people with such\n\npotential for improvement.\n Frustration at the apparently obstinate unwillingness of the Irish to\n\nimprove as a result of the famine led an increasingly large portion of the\n\nEnglish public to believe, however, that the Irish were an irredeemably\n\ninferior race for whom no amount of tutoring would do any good.\n The years that followed saw resurgence of racialist discourse on\n\nIreland that would persist for the remainder of the century.\n\n  The \" condition of Ireland question\" was a matter of great public\n\nattention in the years preceding the famine.\n Ireland was, most people agreed, a country of immense economic\n\npotential existing in the lowest possible state of degradation.\n Fish teemed off her shores, her harbors were some of the best in the\n\nworld, and her land was capable of producing excellent crops.\n Her people, however, seemed unwilling to take advantage of the\n\nnatural resources at their fingertips, living instead in abject poverty\n\nattended by a barbaric state of mind.\n External factors, not inherent flaws in the Irish character, were\n\nconsidered to be responsible for this state of affairs.\n Particularly to blame was the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, as it\n\nperpetuated \" the system which has given to the character of the Celt some of\n\nthe qualities peculiar to a slave population,\"(10) ruling the Irish peasantry\n\nas an alien people incapable of integration into civilized society.\n\n  The worst thing about \" the system\" was that it had stood in the\n\nway of the complete union of the English and Irish people.\n This union was held to be the natural consummation of God 's will; and\n\nwhat God had placed together no man could break apart:\n\n  The condition of Ireland is, directly, the condition of the\n\nBritish empire.\n No legislative union can tighten - no Utopian separation could\n\ndissolve - that intimate and close connexion between the two islands which\n\nhas been formed by the hand of nature, and consolidated by the operations of\n\ntime . . .\n Each year cements by closer fusion the twain branches of the Saxon\n\nand the Celtic stocks . . .\n Whilst our passions are the most excited, and our jealousy the most\n\nvigilant, terror and passion are found equally unavailing to keep those apart\n\nwhom a higher Power than man 's has joined by the contiguity of position and\n\nthe bond of mutual dependence. ( 11)\n\n  The landed aristocracy of Ireland thus acted against natural law\n\nin seeking to perpetuate divisions among the peoples of the British family of\n\nnations.\n Unlike the larger of the British Isles, where Saxon, Norman and Roman\n\nhad \" amalgamated,\" and were in the process of doing so with the Welsh and\n\nScots, in Ireland the races had remained separate. ( 12)\n The blame for this, it was supposed, rested on Anglo-Irish and\n\nEnglish policy as practiced from the twelfth through the eighteenth\n\ncenturies.\n These policies, by segregating the two peoples socially, racially and\n\nreligiously, had kept them artificially divided and had worked to prevent the\n\nproper consummation of the union.\n\n  These errors could only be rectified, it was believed, by\n\nbringing the Irish more fully under English law.\n The Act of Union was only the first step; measures to strengthen this\n\nlegislation through the introduction of measures such as a Poor Law on the\n\nEnglish model were necessary.\n The ultimate aim in doing so was \" the blending and amalgamation of\n\nthe two peoples.\"(13)\n Or, as James Grant put it, \" There is one way, and one way only, of\n\ncrushing repeal.\n That is by rendering Ireland in reality what it is nominally - an\n\nintegral part of the British empire,\" instead of ruling it as \" a conquered\n\nprovince.\"(14)\n The Poor Law Extension Act of 1847 was enacted during the famine with\n\nthis end in mind.\n\n  For all of the English admissions of the shortcomings of British\n\nrule in Ireland through 1800, it was considered inconceivable that the Irish\n\ncould govern themselves.\n The only potential leaders of an Irish government, the English\n\nassumed, would be the Anglo-Irish aristocracy.\n Attacks on repeal of the Union therefore necessarily involved\n\ndenigration of the ability of this class to rule effectively.\n They were therefore roundly excoriated by the English government and\n\npublic as lazy, profligate, and brutal.\n\n\n  the prime cause why the Irish peasantry have been reduced to\n\ntheir present level must be sought for in the neglect and unthrift of past\n\ngenerations of claret- drinking, writ-despising, landlords.(15)\n\n  In this respect the landlords had also become the scapegoats for\n\nEnglish misgovernment.\n\n\n  It would be in the natural order of things for an Irish\n\nparliament of Irish landlords to legislate for themselves and against their\n\ntenantry and the great body of the people. ( 16)\n\n  Peasants and aristocrats could therefore obviously not supervise\n\nthe regeneration of Ireland.\n The assumed absence of a native Irish middle-class ruled out the\n\npossibility that natives of any sort could rule the country.\n The possibility that an Irish middle-class could emerge at any point\n\nin the future was simply not considered.\n The Irish had no choice, therefore, but to look to the English and\n\nScotch middle classes to govern and regenerate Ireland.\n Somerville expressed this attitude in the form of a hypothetical\n\nlecture of a pro-repeal Irishman:\n\n  your parliament, if you had it, would be entirely composed of\n\nlandlords and lawyers, neither of whom as yet have done you any service, but\n\nmuch mischief . . .\n Feudalism and territorial representation is on the decline.\n It will decline more and more in England every year; but you would\n\nrestore it in Ireland by an Irish parliament of landlords and law - jobbers.\n You have no middle class to control them.\n It is to the new current of legislation from the commercial classes\n\nof England that you must look for real substantial benefits to Ireland. (\n\n17)\n\n  Confidence in the English middle-class as the ultimate source of\n\nall social and moral progress combined with the Liberal belief that all human\n\nbeings were capable of moral education and improvement.\n With English help, therefore, the Irish people would not be doomed to\n\nforever exist in a state of semi-barbarism.\n Celts, no less than any other European people, would ultimately prove\n\nresponsive to Liberal treatment.\n Liberals denied, in Somerville 's words, \" the natural incapacity of\n\nthe Celts for becoming a commercial people\" or \" the impossibility of\n\nimproving the Celtic population.\"(18)\n English thrift and forethought would, it was assumed, be transmitted\n\nto the Irish and uplift their physical and mental states to a substantial\n\ndegree.\n\n  Even so, though the Irish were not considered \" inferior,\" it was\n\nassumed that on their improvement the Irish could not simply dispose of\n\nEnglish support and begin to fend for themselves.\n They were instead expected to reciprocate by settling down in\n\ncontented submission, sharing and enjoying the fruits of economic prosperity\n\nthat would follow on realization of the union.\n Despite its apparent optimism, the ultimate purpose of Liberal\n\ndiscourse on Ireland was to justify perpetual English rule under the guise of\n\nthe creation of a British family of nations.\n Critics like Daniel Owen-Madden argued that adherents of this view\n\nerred by failing to recognize the inherent difference of the Celtic people,\n\nwhich made ruling them through English laws and institutions a mistake:\n\n  There is a class of Imperialists who propose to govern Ireland\n\nwithout the slightest regard to local feelings, or to Irish prejudices.\n They would wish to obliterate Ireland in the map of the Empire, and\n\nto substitute West Britain.\n They would first deride all Irish instincts, malign all Irish\n\ncharacter, and then proceed to treat a concursive and semi-celtic population\n\nas if it inherited the individualism and characteristic phlegm of English\n\nnature.\n This school of Imperialists is one made up of Whigs, Whig-Radicals,\n\nand Economists. ( 19)\n\n  A fundamental paradox did lay at the heart of the Liberal\n\ndiscourse.\n Although the principles of social and economic Liberalism could not\n\nadmit that the Irish ( or, indeed any people) were unimprovable, the case for\n\nEnglish rule depended on the continual subservience of the Irish people.\n Englishmen professed their desire to fully assimilate Ireland into\n\nthe British family of nations, ( 20) but also desired to maintain the\n\ncolonial relationship of the two islands.\n Were the Irish ever improved to the extent of being admitted as full\n\nmoral and physical equals of the English, their desire for independence could\n\nno longer be denied; but to justify their subservience on the basis of\n\ninherent racial inferiority would have been to reject the dogma of the\n\nimprovability of all men.\n Somehow the Irish needed to be represented, not as racially inferior\n\nto or incompatible with the English, but as necessarily and perpetually\n\nplaying the subservient role in the Union.\n\n  A conceptual framework for reconciling these paradoxes was at\n\nhand in the rhetoric of marriage.\n Lynda Nead has explained the Victorian concept of marriage in the\n\nfollowing manner:\n\n  The underlying principle of gender division in the nineteenth\n\ncentury was that the two sexes were different and complementary.\n Woman was never described as inferior to man; rather, she was\n\ndifferent, and her differences were to be valued since they entirely\n\ncomplemented male attributes.(21)", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4ab0a088-1a89-4fe4-b22a-da69a461e59a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.892688+00:00"}

{"text": "retinoic acid induces extensive changes in skeletal development\n\nwithout conrurrently affecting the morphogenesis of the musculature in the\n\nregenerating limbs of Ambystoma larva1.\n\n\n  After systemic treatment with retinoic acid ( RA), A. opacum and\n\nA. punctatum larvae regenerated forelimbs with a wide variety of skeletal and\n\ngross anatomical abnormalities.\n Yet the musculatures within the RA-treated limb regenerates were\n\nnormal even in instances where the cartilages were deformed beyond\n\nrecognition as components of the limb skeleton.\n RA is known to induce reduplication of limb structures, sometimes\n\nentire segments thereof.\n When the latter condition occurred in the present study, the\n\ncorresponding replicates exhibited limb musculatures that were perfect down\n\nto minute details, yet of opposite bilateral symmetry.\n\n  The data: *attest to the independence of myogenesis and\n\nchondrogenesis during limb regeneration. *unmasked an otherwise hidden\n\npotential within post-embryonic salamander limb tissue for manufacturing a\n\nmusculature of the opposite side of the body. *generate, as corollary of the\n\nlatter, the thesis that cells of the musculature of the limb regenerate are\n\ndescendents of developmentally uncommitted cells.\n\n\n  In limb regeneration among salamanders, retinoic acid ( RA) can:\n\n*distort skeletogenesis; *transmogrify the new part 's external form;\n\n*stimulate the development of supernumerary cartilages ( and bones in adult\n\nanimals); and *promote the reduplication of entire segments - - fingers,\n\nhands, wrists, forearms, arms and shoulder elements ( or toes, feet, ankles,\n\nlegs and thighs in the hind limb).\n ( See Maden et al 1985; Stocum and Thoms, 1984; Thoms and Stocum,\n\n1984; Ragsdale et al 1989).\n This property of RA permits the testing of an hypothesis advanced\n\nsome years ago to the effect that myogenesis and chondrogenesis are mutually\n\nindependent during limb regeneration ( Pietsch, 1962a).\n\n  The evidence for the independence hypothesis came from\n\nexperiments in which muscle differentiation was caused to vary while\n\nskeletogenesis was held constant.\n RA permited the experimental formulation of the logical converse:\n\nGiven a changed skeletogenic outcome, would the RA-treated limb regenerates\n\nmuscles concomitantly change or proceed to a normal morphogenic conclusion?\n The independence hypothesis predicted the latter alternative.\n While the opportunity presented itself, comparisons were made of the\n\nmuscle patterns within reduplicated members with a view to their bilateral\n\nsymmetry.\n The question motivating the latter was whether, among of the\n\npost-embryonic salamander tissues, cells exist with an ontogenic potentiality\n\nfor manufacturing the opposite limb 's musculature.\n\n\n  The principal experimental subjects were A. opacum and A.\n\npunctatum ( maculatum) larvae brought into the laboratory as gastrulae and\n\nmonitored through the subsequent Harrison stages so as to insure ( by\n\nappropriate culling) the developmental homogeneity of the animal stock.\n Ancillary experiments ( described below) were conducted with 35-40 mm\n\nwhite ( non-albino) A. mexicanum ( axolotl) larvae spawned at the Indiana\n\nUniversity Axolotl Colony. Ambystoma are highly cannibalistic, especially\n\ntowards appendages.\n To avoid uncertainties about the stock ( whether prospective amputees\n\nbore natural or regenerated limbs) and to insure a uniform starting point\n\nwith each experiment, prospective subjects were individually segregated, and\n\nthus maintained, at Harrison stage 43 ( see Rugh, 1962); i. e., prior to the\n\nonset of free feeding.\n The precautions in question were motivated by the fact that nerve\n\npatterns in regenerated limbs are not identical to those in the natural limb\n\n( see Piatt 1957).\n Nerves can influence regenerative myogenesis ( Pietsch, 1962b).\n All animals were kept in 5 percent Holtfreter 's solution, changed\n\ndaily, and daily were fed newly hatched brine shrimp.\n\n  With a view, ultimately, to minimizing photic degradation of RA\n\nin the test subjects, while at the same time maintaining a constant\n\nenvironment for control and experimentals, all animals, except a special\n\ncontrol subgroup, were kept in capped amber bottles and were handled in low\n\nintensity illumination ( after considerable preliminary testing of the\n\nadequacy of the methods).\n The special control animals were kept individually in clear finger\n\nbowls; they showed no differences from the controls in amber bottles.\n Nociceptive procedures ( amputations and injections) were carried out\n\nafter animals had been narcotized in 1:5000 MS 222.\n A. opacum and A. punctatum larvae were 30-32 mm in body length when\n\nsubjected to bilateral amputation through the neck of the humerus, bilateral\n\nin part for economy and efficiency but also for independently assessing\n\nindividual variations, as will be explained with results; the two limbs of a\n\ngiven animal were amputated seconds apart and, in a given run, all limbs were\n\namputated within less than 15 minutes.\n The plane of amputation, coinciding with the juncture of the free\n\nlimb and the body, was selected partly because it could be quickly and\n\nprecisely duplicated in a large number of subjects but also to involve as\n\nmuch of the appendage in regeneration as possible. \n\n  The principal subjects had a wet ( but blotted) body weight of\n\n0.35-0.50 g at the time of treatment.\n The amputated limbs were fixed and examined to confirm the plane of\n\namputation as well as to analyze the natural ( vis-...-vis regenerated)\n\nmusculature.\n Except for a group of untreated controls, the amputees received a\n\nsingle 1.0 ul intracoelomic injection of either dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO) or\n\nDMSO-dissolved all-trans RA ( Sigma XX), using a microinfusion apparatus and\n\noperative procedures detailed elsewhere ( Pietsch, 1987).\n A single batch of DMSO, stored at room temperature, was used\n\nthroughout.\n ( Refrigerated DMSO crystallizes and redissolves with some\n\ndifficulty.3) Aliquots of one large lot of RA ( Sigma 104F-0135) were used in\n\nall experiments, each aliquot having been stored preweighed and dry in a\n\nsealed ampoule, in the dark at - 30 oC, until a few minutes before\n\nadministration.\n ( DMSO solutions of RA show major spectral changes upon thawing.\n DMSO crystallization is sufficiently exergonic to drive redox\n\nreactions among the retinoids.) The dosage of RA was 125 ug/g body weight, a\n\nlevel estimated from prior data ( op. cit.) as the amount that, following\n\nintracoelomic injection, would create a \" treatment interval\" of at least 14\n\ndays.\n\n  Concerning the treatment interval, RA forms a bright yellow ppt\n\nin coelomic ( peritoneal) fluid.\n Spectrophotmetric comparisons of this ppt with freshly dissolved\n\naliquots of its parent batch indicated that the ppt one observes in the body\n\ncavity is indeed RA ( op. cit.).\n Thus, visible through the body wall, the yellow ppt is a positive\n\nindicator of maximal intracoelomic RA treatment in progress at that moment.\n However, to avoid exposing the principal subjects to the bright light\n\nof the dissecting microscope during the putative treatment interval a\n\nparallel monitor series was run with the aforementioned white axolotl larvae\n\n( whose tissues are virtually transparent and whose green gall bladder\n\nprovided a highly contrastable background for the brilliant yellow of the\n\nppt); the right forelimb of each white axolotl was amputated through the\n\nhumeral neck and the retardation of the growth of its blastema was used to\n\nguarantee efficacy ( op. cit. for rationale). \n\n  Principal subjects were divided into groups with each animal\n\nreceiving a single treatment of either RA or DMSO at one of the follows days,\n\npostamputation: 0, 10, 14 or 21 days.\n Two important sets of facts were taken into account in choosing the\n\nsubsequent incubation period.\n First, RA invariably retarded the growth of the blastema ( op. cit.),\n\noften reversibly but sometimes permanently.\n Second, under the conditions of this laboratory, limb regeneration\n\namong larvae of the age and species employed is complete in approximately 30\n\ndays.\n With these facts in mind, the principal subjects were kept alive\n\nuntil either day 108 or day 114, post- amputation; i. e., incubation periods\n\nof durations sufficient to allow for complete regeneration in the face of any\n\ntransitory effects.\n For sacrifice, animals were anesthetized in MS 222 and, when\n\nunconscious, transferred to Bouin 's fixative. \n\n  Specimens were first examined in toto under the stereoscopic\n\nmicroscope.\n Then the entire limb, including the girdle, was dissected and\n\nprocessed for paraffin embedding.\n The limb skeleton of Ambystoma larvae is cartilaginous, obviating the\n\nneed to demineralize the tissue for sectioning.\n Most limbs were oriented ( under the stereoscopic microscope) for\n\nserial transverse sectioning though at least the wrist and forearm and, when\n\npossible ( in the face of reduplications and distortions) the hand.\n After bending the elbow 90o, the upper arm was serially sectioned,\n\nlongitudinally in some instances, and transversely in others.\n Slides were stained with Mallory 's trichrome procedure ( after which\n\ncollagen appears blue and muscle tissue red).\n No species differences were observed.\n Therefore, for the sake of simplicity the data from A. opacum and A.\n\npunctatum will be combined for presentation.\n\n\n\n  In the white axolotls used to monitor dosage, the yellow RA ppt\n\nwas visible for some 14-17 days, during which time regeneration of the right\n\nforelimb ( the bioassay) was severely retarded.\n Thus, considering the treatment schedule employed in the principal\n\nexperiments, no phase of regeneration escaped the effects of RA, when the\n\ngroups are considered collectively.\n\n\n  The effects of RA on skeletogenesis were basically similar to\n\nthose reported in the literature ( see especially Maden et al, 1985; Thoms\n\nand Stocum, 1984).\n Thus only an overall summary on the macroscopic findings will be\n\npresented here ( see Table 1).\n No regenerated limb of either the untreated or the DMSO-treated\n\ncontrol animals showed any skeletal abnormalities or distortions of\n\nmacroscopic form.\n Among the limbs of animals treated with RA on the day of amputation (\n\nday 0 in Table 1), 62.5 percent showed external abnormalities; those with no\n\noutwardly obvious malformations, upon subsequent histological examination,\n\nwithout exception, showed some form of skeletal deformity.\n With RA treatment at day 10, over 72 percent of the cases had an\n\nexternal abnormality.\n Again, microscopic examination revealed skeletal malformations in the\n\nbalance of the cases.\n All subjects treated at either 14 or 21 days showed macroscopically\n\nvisible malformations, and histological sections revealed additional\n\nanomalies among the cartilages.\n In sum, skeletogenesis failed to reach a completely normal outcome in\n\na single RA- treated regenerate during the entire investigation.\n\n  Now considerable individual variation attended the types of\n\nmalformations, far more than had been anticipated a priori, the aberrations\n\nranging from syndactyly to supernumerary digits to segmental reduplications (\n\nFigs. 1-8).\n Compound anomalies were not at all rare ( note Figs. 5 and 6).\n With one relatively minor exception ( see next paragraph), no obvious\n\ncorrelation existed between the type of abnormality and the day of treatment.\n That variability was not attributable to protocol was attested to by\n\nthe lack of correlation between contralateral regenerates from the same\n\nanimal ( with amputations within seconds apart and identical systemic RA\n\ntreatment): the regenerate of one side might terminate in a conical structure\n\nwhile that of the other could exhibit two or even three forearms, wrists and\n\nhands with varying numbers of fingers.\n Or one side might show a two- or three-fingered hand ( the normal\n\nnumber is 4) while the other might have two or even three hands, the hands\n\nthemselves with their own intrinsic abnormalities. ( See also Figures 4 and\n\n5.) \n\n  The crucial point here is that the observed variability is a\n\nfunction of the system 's response to RA.\n The exceptional condition involved hyperplasia of the shoulder ( see\n\nFigs. 7, 8).\n All RA-treated specimen, irrespective of the day of treatment,\n\nexhibited enlarged shoulders and supernumerary girdle parts were evident upon\n\nmicroscopic examination ( Fig. 9).\n But with treatment at days 14 or 21 the proximal arms bulged\n\nconspicuously and were macroscopically obvious in each RA-treated\n\nspecimen.\n\n\n  The criteria for the analysis of muscle patterns may be found in\n\nBlount ( 1935), and Piatt ( 1956, 1957); see also Grim and Carlson ( 1974).\n A brief summary description of the highlights of the natural limb\n\nmusculatures is presented here for the reader 's convenience.\n Diagrammatic representations may be found in Figures 10-12.\n The girdle musculature was too complex for critical analysis in the\n\n2-dimensional array presented by microscopic sections.\n However, distal to the insertions of the scapular and pectoral\n\nmuscles, sections of the arm, whether longitudinal or transverse, presented\n\nthree easily identifiable muscles ( using Blount 's terminology): 1. anconeus\n\n( triceps), dorsally; 2. coracobrachialis, ventromedially; 3.\n\nhumero-antibrachialis ( homologue of the human biceps brachii and\n\nbrachialis), ventrolaterally.\n\n  The small but constant and highly recognizable ulnocarpalis\n\nmuscle has furnished an invaluable landmark in cross sections of the\n\nAmbystoma forearm and wrist for other investigations ( see Piatt, 1956; 1957;\n\nPietsch, 1961a, b; 1962a, b), and the present experiments were no exception.\n The ulnocarpalis runs parallel and ventral to most of the ulna and,\n\npassing into the wrist, inserts into the deep fascia ( mesenchymal in the\n\nlarva) on the volar aspect of the middle row of carpals.\n Having identified the ulnocarpalis, the observer can immediately\n\ndistinguish the ulna from the radius ( otherwise impossible without serially\n\ntracing), quickly pick out the obliquely oriented pronator quadratis and\n\nconfidently stipulate the flexor versus extensor surface of the forearm.\n The observer can then ascertain the extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor\n\ndigitorum ( communis) and extensor carpi radialis, dorsally, and the flexor\n\ncarpi ulnaris, palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis, ventrally.\n Muscles were analyzed in the serial sections of 4 untreated and 27\n\nDMSO-treated control regenerates; each one exhibited the cross sectional\n\nanatomy described in the previous paragraph for the natural limbs ( Figs.\n\n13-16)</P>", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "95f05139-9f53-4070-8a7f-302107ba20a6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.895423+00:00"}
{"text": "Behaviorism: Initial attempts to explain first language\n\nacquisition were provided by B.F. Skinner ( 1957, 1968) and the Behaviorists\n\nschool of thought.\n On the surface, it is easy to understand why Behaviorists make an\n\nanalogy between the types of behavior studied by Skinner and verbal behavior.\n After all, numerous controlled experiments prove that animals may be\n\ntrained into a behavior if the operant ( desired response) that it produces\n\nis continually reinforced through reward.\n This viewpoint, understood in the framework of an operant\n\nconditioning/ S-R-R model, posits through analogy that infants must learn to\n\nspeak by trying out their language ( stimulus), and that when they succeed in\n\ncommunicating ( response), the reward that they receive encourages them to\n\ndevelop appropriate verbal habits.\n In this manner, the child learning to speak is like a tabula rasa, or\n\nblank slate, that acquires all its behavioral tendencies ( including\n\nlanguage) through systematically rewarded behavior.\n Thus, it is \" nurture\" that creates a fully functioning language user\n\nand it is the reward one receives for correctly mimicking and displaying\n\nappropriate forms that results in children becoming competent speakers.\n The behaviorist model contends that no cognition occurs in the passive\n\nlanguage learner; instead, the speaker 's psychomotor skills are developed\n\nthrough the S-R-R model, and only observable behavior is considered relevant\n\nto the discussion.\n\n  Applying this to the topic of African American vernacular English,\n\nthen, the Behaviorist approach would argue that some population of America 's\n\nblacks would have to have been raised in households in which only certain\n\ngrammatical constructions were rewarded and in which others were not.\n For example, one standard feature of AAVE is the loss of the\n\nthird-person present \" - s\" marker on verbs, so that Standard English \" He\n\nwrites\" would appear as \" He write.\"\n In order for this feature to be acquired by infants, according to\n\nBehaviorists, it would need to be continually reinforced as correct verbal\n\nbehavior; furthermore, the acquisition of Standard English 's \" - s\" marker in\n\nsuch an environment would not occur unless it received similar reward.\n While I don't believe it is rational to totally dismiss the language\n\nenvironment of the home and the role that caregivers play in the process of\n\nacquisition, I do believe that such a reductive view of language acquisition\n\nfails to fully account for the full experience of acquiring one 's first\n\nlanguage.\n This same point was first articulated by members of the Innatists\n\ncamp, described below.\n\n  Innatism: Noam Chomsky was one of the first researchers who\n\nsought to replace the idea of \" nuture\" with one of \" nature.\"\n\n  As the preeminent Innatist scholar, Chomsky ( 1965) raised a\n\nnumber of important questions about language development in children that\n\nsimply could not be accounted for by Skinner.\n For example, if a child was like a blank slate, he inquired, intaking\n\nand repeating the \" correct\" language around them, why do children not speak\n\nin parentese--the prosodically and structurally marked baby-talk to which\n\nmany children are exposed?\n Furthermore, how do we account for language development in those\n\ncultures where adults do not speak directly to children?\n Chomsky 's theory posited the notion of poverty of stimulus;\n\ncontending that almost all utterances are truly novel, and that as result,\n\nchildren can not possibly be exposed to all the correct types of language\n\nstructures.\n Simply stated, there are just not enough stimuli during the child 's\n\ndevelopmental stages to accurately hypothesize a process of\n\ninternalization-through-mimicry.\n In the class video Language Series Part 2, Pinker also points out\n\nthat a child, even when corrected, is likely to ignore such correction and\n\nmake the same mistakes again and again.\n Chomsky also addresses in this video a problem with the Behaviorist 's\n\nbelief that a child would learn appropriate patterns for word classes, and\n\nthen extend those patterns to create new utterances.\n His case is made with a \" red barn,\" example, which shows how the\n\nconstruction, \" I painted the barn red/the red barn,\" does not allow for a\n\nsimple replacement in the verb category: \" I saw the red barn./ ! I saw the\n\nbarn red.\" In other words, the idea that a child could generate novel\n\nutterances by learning and extending patterns to which they have been exposed\n\nwas ineffective for accounting for real language acquisition.\n\n  Rather than \" nurture,\" Chomsky and other scholars ( Lenneberg:\n\n1967, MacNeill: 1968) believe that human beings are born with a\n\nspecies-specific Language Acquisition Device, an innate system embedded with\n\nuniversal principles that, after being shaped by exposure to language\n\nstructures, selects appropriate parameters to generate a discreetly infinite\n\nnumber of grammatical constructions in the language into which a learner is\n\nborn.\n Accordingly, Chomsky has contended, children \" grow\" language in the\n\nsame way that birds \" grow\" wings.\n The system may be viewed as a series of switches, turned on or off by\n\nthe demands of the native language, that serially generate the rules for\n\nlanguage production.\n Such a device provides language users with a deep ( possibly sub- or\n\nun-conscious) awareness of their native language 's sounds and structures.\n According to MacNeill, the LAD contains at least four linguistic\n\nproperties: the ability to distinguish speech sounds from other sounds in\n\nnature, the ability to organize linguistic data into classes that cane later\n\nbe modified, the ability to recognize that only some language systems are\n\npossible, while others are impossible, and finally, the ability to evaluate\n\nthe developing linguistic system so as to construct the simplest possible\n\nsystem out of the available linguistic input ( Brown, 24).\n In effect, Brown ( 2000) summarizes this perspective in contrast to\n\nBehaviorism by arguing that child language development is not a matter of\n\ngradually decreasing \" incorrect\" structures, but instead, is a process in\n\nwhich \" the child is constantly forming hypotheses \" [ which] are continually\n\nrevised, reshaped, or sometimes abandoned.\"(25)\n\n  Although such features as hypotheses formation are almost\n\nimpossible to prove, the model described above is not without its merits.\n The phenomenon of language in nearly all humans, coupled with the\n\nfact that numerous languages share common features offers some support for\n\nthe notion of a Universal Grammar, which we might define as the LAD 's initial\n\nstate before parameters have been set.\n Yet I would argue that such a model neglects important considerations\n\nwith respect to the role that socialization plays in the process of language\n\nacquisition.\n Reducing the process to the most basic features of physiology, for\n\nexample, also assumes that language learners are passive and have no control\n\nover their own development.\n In the case of our AEMP students, the UG hypothesis does not account\n\nfor the reasons why certain structures may appear more frequently in the\n\nspeech of their respective language communities than in others.\n Critiques of this model were raised by Social Interactionsits, who\n\nwill be discussed below.\n\n\n  Important theories of language acquisition came through the work\n\nof Piaget ( 1972), Bloom ( 1971) and others, who examined the ways in which a\n\nchild 's cognitive abilities might be related to their language abilities.\n In a developmental model such as Piaget 's, a child 's interaction with\n\nthe world is a factor in the child 's development, and corresponds to an\n\nincrease in cognitive abilities.\n As Brown explains, Piaget \" described overall development as the\n\nresult of children 's interaction with their environment\"(29)\n Here, we have an example of the child-learner not as passive in the\n\nprocess of learning language, but rather, as increasingly aware of language\n\nin the real-world environment.\n\n  Whereas Innatist theorists were concerned with the underlying\n\nforms of language, this approach allowed researchers to consider the ways in\n\nwhich the pragmatic nature of language--the part of language that allows us\n\nto engage with our environment--might be a driving force behind the\n\ndeveloping of language in humans.\n This is understood as a functional, rather than a formal,\n\nconsideration.\n Dan Slobin ( 1971, 1986) asserts that language development is couched\n\nin the need to acquire an increasingly complex semantic schema--that is, the\n\nneed to use language to interact with the environment--which in turn,\n\ntriggers those processing capabilities concerned with the grammatical and\n\nstructural forms of language. \n\n  In the same functional scope of language development, the Social\n\nInteractionists are also interested in the ways in which the\n\nlanguage-learners environment sets the pace at which a child learns.\n However, unlike strict Behaviorists, Social Interactionists also\n\naccept that fact that language structure is unique and unlike other\n\nbehaviors.\n For these researchers, the structure of language manifests as such\n\ndue to the need of people to interact socially, and so the function of\n\nlanguage, more than the form, becomes the important component.\n Instead of mimicking the language of their parents, children,\n\naccording to Social Interactionists, receive cues about language through\n\nacculturation, or through the familiarization/confrontation of the\n\nsocio-historic specificities of their real-world conditions.\n These include such things as economic standing, access to educational\n\nmaterials, and the status of an individual 's language with respect to\n\nsociety-at-large.\n Language as part of cultural capital, does not exist in a vacuum and\n\ncan not be disarticulated from its relationship to the language user; rather,\n\nit is part of a cultural capital \" package\" that contains, \" forms of\n\nknowledge; skill; education; and any advantages a person has which give them\n\na higher status in society, including high expectations\" ( \" Cultural\n\ncapital,\" Wikipedia.org, 2005)\n\n  Accepting the role that these conditions play in the development\n\nof language, we might assert that as interactions with the real-world become\n\nmore complex, so too does the internal language faculty.\n This particular was taken up by Vygotsky 's ( 1978), who argued that\n\nlanguage-based social interaction is actually the precursor to cognitive\n\ndevelopment.\n His suggestion of a zone of proximal development has been used to\n\ncharacterize the distance between a learner 's potential development and the\n\ncurrent state of their cognition.\n Thus, language is taken to be a tool for children to begin the\n\nprocess of social interaction, and an example of this is Child Directed\n\nSpeech--a type of speech game in which a child is able to manipulate the\n\nlanguage/behavior of those around her in such a way as to learn the important\n\nstructural, semantic, and pragmatic clues that children use to engage with\n\nthe world.\n Researchers like Holzman ( 1984), developed this idea further by\n\nsuggesting a \" reciprocal\" or \" bidirectional model\" of language which\n\nessential states that it is the caregiver 's relationship to the child that\n\ncreates the parameters by which a child will learn to use language.\n That is to say that even CDS is guided by the concrete reality that\n\nsurrounds a child, so that a child 's response ( attention, speech, etc.)\n\nshapes the caregivers output, and vice versa.\n\n  There is evidence that CDS play an important role in a\n\nchild 'schild 's language development, but it is also accepted that CDS does\n\nnot appear in all languages, and is not uniform when it does appear.\n Brice Heath ( 2006), for instance, was able to produce data on the\n\nways that differing socio-cultural environments could shape the types of\n\nlinguistic input that children received.\n Comparing two working-class communities-- Trackton, a black\n\ncommunity, and Roadville, a white community--Brice Heath \" documented how\n\ntheir quite distinct ways of learning language affected their integration\n\ninto academic life\" for \" each differed from expectations the mainstream\n\nfamilies and schools held about uses of language.\"\n In short, we see the emergence of socio-historical and economic\n\nactualities taking a much greater role in the process of language\n\nacquisition. \n\n This phenomenon, often referred to as the home-school cultural mismatch,\n\naccounts for the fact that differences between the cultures to which children\n\nare exposed in the familial setting and in the school setting can be highly\n\nproblematic for students when schools fail to recognize the differences.\n In the case of the AEMP model, there seems to be an informed\n\nawareness of this mismatch as a root problem in the performance gap.\n The antithesis of this awareness is manifest in the question posed by\n\nthe student who asked, \" If blacks in America are being exposed to the same\n\ntype of English that they are, why aren't they learning Standard English?\"\n A Social Interactionist perspective, I argue, provides us with the\n\nclues to answer this question appropriately: In any given culture, different\n\ncompetencies are valued over other, as are the various types of abilities\n\nthat language-users possess.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "846b6f13-f3d4-4d03-9343-67b699f31f15", "added":

{"text": "If the student is taken for a psychiatric evaluation and returns to\n\nschool shortly afterwards, I would call her parents and strongly urge them to\n\nput their daughter in therapy with a licensed therapist or psychiatrist if\n\nthey have not done so already.\n I would explain, being careful not to use these exact words that imply\n\n\" diagnoses\" on my part, that she is exhibiting signs of depression, cutting,\n\nand an eating disorder, and that I think it would be in her best interest to\n\nsee a mental health professional on a regular basis for intense therapy.\n I would have an ethical responsibility to make this suggestion and a\n\nreferral, because I am not skilled in treating eating disorders or in\n\ncounseling students who cut themselves.\n I would take steps to increase my competency in these areas, but she\n\nwould be better served by a professional trained to help with these issues.\n I would refer her and her parents to some mental health professionals\n\nin the area who specialize in dealing with eating disorders and/or\n\ncutting.\n\n  For my part, I would then continue to monitor the student and\n\nwould try to provide her with a safe and trusting space for her to share her\n\nfeelings and thoughts.\n I would revisit the \" Life Contract\" we started together and check in\n\nregularly to assess her progress and level of suicide risk.\n I might also ask if she would be willing to let me speak to her\n\ntherapist or psychiatrist about her progress, so that I could help support\n\nher better in school.\n If she agrees, I would ask both her and her parents for their written\n\nconsent.\n\n  I would support her in any way I can in school, and I might\n\nspecifically work with her on increasing her self-esteem, working on anger\n\nmanagement techniques to encourage her to find other outlets for her anger\n\ninstead of cutting her skin, and developing her career aspirations so that\n\nshe can create more of a connection with her future.\n I will engage her in conversations about basketball and her interest\n\nin going professional, and will help her plan how she can work toward her\n\ngoal of playing in the WNBA.\n I will also encourage academic achievement, involvement in school\n\nactivities, and exploration of other career interests she may have.\n I might also advocate to her teachers on her behalf, explaining that\n\nshe has been going through some things ( without going into more detail) and\n\nasking if she might be given the opportunity to make up some missed\n\nassignments.\n\n  I would thank the student for coming to me and assure her that\n\nshe is being a good friend by telling a trusted adult about her concerns for\n\nher classmate.\n I would tell her that I would follow up to make sure that her\n\nclassmate stays safe and that she can help her friend by continuing to be\n\nkind to her.\n I would also advise her to not share what her classmate tells her\n\nwith other students in order to avoid the spread of gossip or rumors, which\n\nwould probably make her classmate feel even more upset.\n I would assure her that she can come and talk with me about her\n\nconcerns whenever she wants and that if she suspects her friend is in\n\nimmediate danger, she should tell an adult immediately.\n\n  Once the concerned classmate leaves my office, I would first tell\n\nthe school principal what I have heard and assure him/her that I will speak\n\nto the parents.\n I would then try to meet with the student before calling her parents\n\nin order to begin conducting an informal assessment.\n According to section A.2.a. of ASCA 's Ethical Standards for School\n\nCounselors, I would have to begin the session by explaining confidentiality\n\nand its limitations.\n I would then ask her how she is feeling about school and her life at\n\nhome and would try to provide a supportive environment for her to express\n\nherself.\n I would explain to her that others had expressed concerns about her\n\nwell being and remind her that I am here to listen and help her.\n I would explain my need to tell her parents what I have heard in\n\norder to keep her safe, and I would communicate to her that even if she tells\n\nme that her parents already know she has tried to kill herself, I need to\n\ncall home to speak with them about it just in case.\n I would offer to call one or both of her parents in her presence so\n\nthat she can participate in the phone call.\n I would also conduct a lethality assessment to determine if she\n\ncurrently has suicidal thoughts and whether or not she has devised a suicide\n\nplan.\n I may ask her to complete a \" Life Contract\" and would continue to\n\ncheck in with her regularly.\n I would meet with her in the future to discuss her feelings about\n\nschool and her parents' divorce and would work with her on topics such as\n\nself-esteem and coping with divorce.\n\n  Either after the student leaves my office or with her, I would\n\ncall her classmate 's parents ( both parents if they both have legal rights to\n\ninformation regarding their daughter) to express my concerns about what I\n\nhave heard.\n Perhaps the student has not actually told her mother that she\n\nattempted suicide, so I would have a legal and ethical duty to warn her\n\nparents just in case.\n As explained in the previous answer, as mandated after the Eisel case\n\nin Maryland, I would have a legal duty to contact her parents.\n I would want to offer my support and concerns and ask if the student\n\nis actually seeing a psychiatrist for her depression.\n I would encourage her parents to take her for a psychiatric\n\nevaluation if she has not already had one or is not actually seeing a\n\npsychiatrist currently.\n I would recommend local mental health counseling services, family\n\ncounseling services, and other appropriate resources that may be helpful.\n\n  I would also ask the parents to provide me with some background\n\ninformation on her daughter, including when they noticed that their daughter\n\nhad become withdrawn and first attempted to take her own life.\n If the parents ask for suggestions on what they can do to help at\n\nhome, I might suggest that they support their daughter by spending time with\n\nher, asking open questions in a nonjudgmental manner, and validating her\n\nfeelings.\n I would also ask her parents if there are specific things they think\n\nI might be able to do in school to help their daughter.\n I would continue to communicate with them regarding their daughter 's\n\ngeneral progress in the future but would also remind them of the importance\n\nof confidentiality in the counseling environment.\n According to section B.5.b.\n of the ACA Code of Ethics, I should explain to the parents my role as\n\na counselor and the importance of confidentiality in my relationship with\n\ntheir daughter ( 2005).\n I would explain that in order to have a trusting relationship with\n\ntheir daughter, I would keep what she tells me private, unless I have reason\n\nto believe she is in danger.\n I would also explain that if they and their daughter feel comfortable\n\npermitting the psychiatrist and I to communicate regarding her therapy in\n\norder to help her in the best way possible, they could provide their written\n\nconsent for the sharing of information.\n\n  I would first discuss confidentiality and its limits in the\n\ncounseling setting.\n Establishing an environment of trust and support would be crucial for\n\ndeveloping a counseling relationship with this student.\n I would use active listening and open questioning to encourage him to\n\nexplore his feelings about his sexuality and the fears he has about telling\n\nhis parents that he is homosexual.\n After the initial counseling session, I might do some more research\n\non Fontaine and Hammond 's six stages of identity formation.\n I would keep these stages in mind and try to informally assess what\n\nstage this student might be in currently, so that I can support him in the\n\nmost helpful manner.\n I would ask questions in a gentle, nonjudgmental manner, such as, \"\n\nWhen did you first starting having these feelings? Tell me about what that\n\nwas like.\" According to section A.4.b.\n of the ACA Code of Ethics, it would be important that I be aware of\n\nmy own personal values and attitudes related to homosexuality when working\n\nwith this student, so that I am careful not to impose any of my own values on\n\nhim.\n I would also ask him whether or not he has experimented or acted on\n\nhis feelings, and if he has, I would talk with him about the importance of\n\npracticing safe sex.\n Perhaps this student still questions his sexual identity, or perhaps\n\nhe has known that he was homosexual for years and is feeling very comfortable\n\nwith his identity.\n He may or may not have given a good deal of thought to how and when\n\nhe might tell his parents and what their reaction might be.\n\n  I would support this student and counselor him against doing or\n\nsaying anything before he feels that he is truly ready.\n If the student talks about feeling confused and is therefore in the\n\nfirst stage of identity formation, I might first recommend a book he could\n\nread about identifying one 's sexuality.\n I might also encourage this student to consider joining an LGTB club\n\nat school or in the community if he feels comfortable.\n This might be a good place for him to explore his feelings with\n\nothers and receive support and advice regarding dealing with family issues.\n I would also give him information about local community agencies that\n\nmight offer him some support.\n I would talk with him about his current relationship with his\n\nparents, discuss his parents' relationship with his brother since his brother\n\ncame out, and discuss whether or not he has told his brother that he is\n\nhomosexual.\n I would ask if he feels comfortable talking with his brother before\n\ntelling his parents.\n His brother might be able to help him tell his parents or give him\n\nsuggestions on how he might go about telling them.\n During this stage, the student needs to feel safe and supported while\n\nhe explores his feelings and options.\n\n  I would explain to the student that I cannot give him any answers\n\nregarding whether or not he should tell his parents, but I might suggest we\n\ndiscuss the pros and cons of telling his parents.\n This will help him to mentally map out the possible consequences and\n\noutcomes of telling his parents.\n I would encourage him to share his fears and hopes about telling his\n\nparents, and I might suggest we role play how he could tell them.\n We could role play possible outcomes of his telling his parents and\n\ndiscuss how he might react to each of them.\n This would help him explore whether or not he feels comfortable\n\ntelling his parents and would help prepare him for dealing with his parents'\n\npossibly unfavorable reactions.\n\n  When and if he does decide to tell his parents, I would provide\n\nsupport for him, encourage him to find support in close friends or a LGBT\n\ngroup, and would offer to talk with his parents if he feels that this might\n\nhelp.\n I would consider referring him to a mental health counselor if he\n\nexhibits symptoms of depression following his discussion with his parents,\n\nand I would have a legal and ethical duty to tell his parents if I believe he\n\nis in danger of harming himself or if he runs away from home.\n\n  My HMO healthcare provider covers mental health services.\n Mental health counseling and chemical dependency counseling are\n\ncovered, but family counseling and marriage counseling are not covered.\n Only individual therapy is covered; group counseling is not covered.\n There is a twenty dollar co-pay per visit for both mental health and\n\nchemical dependency individual counseling.\n No referrals are needed to receive mental health and chemical\n\ndependency counseling.\n Twenty-six counseling visits per year are covered, but counseling\n\nservice providers can write referrals to extend the number of needed sessions\n\nper year, and insurance will cover these as well.\n Inpatient hospital care for all medical services, including mental\n\nhealth and chemical dependency-related services, is covered by insurance,\n\nminus a one hundred dollar admission fee.\n My provider covers inpatient hospital care for an unlimited number of\n\ndays.\n\n  The ethical and legal issues and counseling topics we discussed\n\nin class were extremely useful and relevant to my role as an aspiring\n\nprofessional school counselor.\n Before entering this class, I knew very little about the specific\n\nethical standards that school counselors should uphold and knew nothing about\n\nthe laws we must abide by pertaining to counseling minors, school records,\n\nsubpoenas, abuse, and suicide.\n I have now learned and practiced utilizing the steps to take when\n\nfaced with an ethical dilemma.\n I also particularly enjoyed the class presentations on important\n\ntopics and issues school counselors face.\n As well as gathering useful resources ( PowerPoint presentations and\n\nannotated bibliographies) for future professional development, I also learned\n\nthe ethical and legal responsibilities related to each topic or issue\n\ndiscussed.\n I also appreciated the suggestions in each presentation for how\n\nschool counselors can advocate on behalf of both students and the school\n\ncounseling program.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4d6d4af8-e79f-4480-830a-43cec37a949d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.899799+00:00"}
{"text": "While incineration has been used to dispose of sewage sludge since\n\nthe 1930s, serious concern regarding environmental impact due to organic\n\nemissions has developed only recently ( 1).\n Results of field tests on systems in the United States have shown that\n\na number of toxic products of incomplete combustion ( PICs) may be emitted\n\nfrom multiple-hearth and fluidized-bed units ( 2-10).\n Other studies have generated concern over the possible emissions of\n\npolychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans\n\n( PCDFs) ( 2,3).\n Studies on multiple-hearth units in Canada have shown that some\n\nmaterials may be rapidly vaporized on the upper hearths ( drying zone) and\n\nswept from the unit before combustion temperatures are realized ( 11).\n A recent laboratory study has shown that sludge can exert a\n\nstabilizing effect on some of the toxic industrial contaminants in sewage\n\nsludge, retarding their destruction ( 12).\n In addition, this same study has shown that a number of toxic PICs may\n\nbe formed from degradation of the sludge biomass as well as the contaminants.\n This raises some concerns over the toxic organic emission from sewage\n\nsludge incineration and suggest that a better understanding of the nature of\n\nthese emissions is necessary before adequate regulatory and control\n\nstrategies can be developed.\n\n  The University of Dayton participated in a study which compared\n\nthe results of bench-scale thermal decomposition testing of four sewage\n\nsludge samples.\n These samples were also incinerated as part of a full-scale test\n\nprogram conducted by Radian Corporation under U.S. Environmental Protection\n\nAgency ( EPA) sponsorship ( 4-10).\n The primary goal of the study was to determine if laboratory test\n\nresults could be used to predict full-scale results, and if laboratory and\n\ntheoretical predictions could be used as part of a comprehensive organic\n\nemissions risk assessment.\n One fluidized-bed and three multiple-hearth facilities were examined.\n The key operating parameters for these facilities are summarized in\n\nTable 1.\n\n\n\n  Thermal decomposition testing for all four sewage sludge samples\n\nwas conducted using the System for Thermal Diagnostic Studies ( STDS) ( 13).\n This high-temperature. gas-phase, flow reactor assembly permits study\n\nof the thermal decomposition of gaseous, liquid, solid, or polymeric\n\nsubstances under very precise, well-controlled conditions.\n\n  The STDS incorporates a bench-scale thermal decomposition unit\n\nwith an in- line analytical unit for product analysis.\n The thermal unit includes a modular control console and a modified\n\nHP5890 GC which houses the sample insertion region, a high-temperature\n\nfurnace, fused-silica reactor, and the associated transfer lines.\n The system is capable of temperatures up to 1200 C and gas- phase\n\nreactor times, tr of 0.1-10.0 sec.\n The analytical unit of the STDS is comprised of another HP 5890 GC\n\nwhich is coupled to a computer- controlled HP 5970B bench-top Mass Selective\n\nDetector ( MSD) for product analysis.\n\n  A DB-5, 30m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25-micron film thickness capillary\n\ncolumn ( J&W) was held at - 60 C to trap the reactor effluent.\n The effluent was separated by programming the GC oven from - 60 C to\n\n290 C using helium carrier gas.\n The MSD was operated in the full-scan ( 10-500 amu) or Selected Ion\n\nMonitoring ( SIM) mode using electron impact ionization at 70 eV.\n Calibration of the MSD response for specific \" target list\" compounds\n\nwas accomplished using appropriate analytical standards.\n\n  Upon receipt, the sludge samples from each site were frozen until\n\n24 hours prior to use.\n For each experiment, approximately 5 mg of sludge was placed in a\n\nquartz sample tube assembly located in the insertion region of the STDS.\n The sludge samples were used \" as received\" with no dewatering or\n\ntreatment of any kind.\n A gas-phase reactor residence time of 1.5 sec was used for all\n\nexperiments.\n Data were obtained under both oxidative and pyrolytic conditions.\n However, only the pyrolysis data are reported due to their better\n\ncorrelation with full-scale results.\n A more complete discussion of this observation will be presented in\n\nthe Discussion section of this report.\n\n\n  The typical multiple-hearth incinerator consists of 6 to 12\n\nhearths on which the sludge progressively resides as it is dried and\n\ncombusted, and the ash is finally cooled.\n The sludge enters the top of the incinerator and progressively drops\n\nthrough holes to lower hearths as it is raked and abraded by rabble arms (\n\n14).\n There are 3 thermal regimes along the sludge path.\n In the drying zone ( T(gas) ~ 425 C, T(Sludge) ~ 70 C), which exists\n\non the upper hearths, water is gradually driven off the sludge so that the\n\nmaterial may be combusted.\n The sludge is actually incinerated in the central combustion zone (\n\nT(gas) ~ 830 C), T(sludge) ~ 730 C, and the ash is cooled in the cooling zone\n\n( T(gas) ~ 175 C, T(sludge) ~ 200 C) ( 12).\n\n  Simulation of the staged increases in bed and gas temperatures\n\nthrough the hearths of the multiple-hearth incinerator was achieved using a\n\nseries of four stepped increases in the temperature of the CDS Model 120\n\npyroprobe located in the insertion region of the STDS, accompanied by\n\nspecific downstream reactor temperatures.\n After a sample was loaded into the CDS pyroprobe and positioned in\n\nthe insertion region, the temperature was ramped from 50 C to 200 C @ 15\n\nC/min and then from 200 C to 300 C @ 15 C/min, with downstream reactor\n\ntemperatures of 300 C and 450 C, respectively.\n These first two steps in the sludge exposure were designed to\n\ndetermine the relative contribution to emissions of volatilization of the\n\nsludge n the upper hearths of the multiple- hearth incinerator and the range\n\nof temperatures which may be experienced there.\n In the third and fourth steps of the exposure scenario, the sludge\n\nwas rapidly taken to 550 C and then to 700 C using the heating coil of the\n\nCDS pyroprobe assembly; the downstream reactor temperatures were 600 C and\n\n800 C, respectively.\n These last two steps were designed to simulate the combustion zone of\n\nthe multiple-hearth incinerator and the range of temperatures which may be\n\nexperienced there.\n GC-MS analysis was performed at the end of each step in this process.\n The individual contributions were then directly summed to provide for\n\nthe total emissions from laboratory- simulated \" incineration\" of the sludge\n\nsample.\n It was necessary to include data from all temperatures in the\n\nlaboratory simulation because emissions in the stacks of full-scale units are\n\na culmination of emissions from all of the hearths, not just the combustion\n\nhearths.\n These results were qualitatively compared to mass emission factors\n\nfor each of the three full-scale facilities.\n\n  In a fluidized-bed incinerator, the mass of the bed is quite\n\nlarge in relation to the injected sludge ( 14).\n This affords excellent abrasive action on the sludge and maintains\n\ntemperature uniformity within the reactor.\n Temperatures, which are limited by the melting point of the bed\n\nmaterial range from 750 C to 870 C and do not typically vary more than 5 C\n\nthroughout the bed or freeboard of the incinerator.\n Thus, the problems of volatilization and incomplete combustion\n\nassociated with the drying zone of the multiple-hearth incinerator are not\n\nexpected to be as severe with the fluidized-bed incinerator.\n\n  Simulation of the single fluidized-bed unit was performed by\n\nrapidly heating the sludge 700 C in the insertion region of the STDS,\n\nfollowed by a downstream reactor exposure of 700 C.\n GC-MS techniques were again employed to perform analysis of the\n\nreactor effluent.\n Laboratory data from this exposure was then compared with full-scale\n\ndata from the single fluidized-bed facility.\n\n\n  Table 2 lists the major emissions detected in laboratory testing\n\nof the four sewage sludges.\n Experiments in which data acquisition was performed with the MSD in\n\nfull-scan mode ( i.e. 10 - - > 500 amu mass range scanned) showed that the\n\nmajority of mass emission from the thermal decomposition of all four sludges\n\nresulted from decomposition of the biomass of the sludge itself.\n Many long- chain carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes, amino acids,\n\netc., were detected.\n Even the two most common and abundant emissions seen from all four\n\nsludges, benzene and toluene, were more a result of the thermal decomposition\n\nof biological material present in the sludge than from any initial\n\ncontamination in the feed itself.\n This conclusion was based upon the observation that the mass emission\n\nrate of benzene and toluene always surpassed any initial feed rate in the\n\nsludge, if these two compounds were even detected in the sludge feed at all.\n The same phenomenon ( i.e. the majority of mass emissions resulting\n\nfrom the sludge biomass) was observed in previous laboratory studies in which\n\nrelatively clean sludge and sludge spiked with known concentrations of\n\ncontaminants were subjected to controlled thermal exposures ( 12).\n\n  Sulfur-containing compounds were only observed in laboratory\n\ntesting of samples from Sites 2 and 3.\n The sources of influent wastewater for both of these facilities were\n\nlisted as industrial and municipal, respectively.\n Perhaps the industrial contribution to the influent waste stream in\n\nboth cases was responsible for the sulfur-containing emissions.\n\n  The reactor effluent from the laboratory fluidized-bed sample\n\nfrom Site 3 ( 700 C) was notably much cleaner in terms of number and relative\n\nyield of products than that observed for the three multiple-hearth samples.\n This is as one might expect, based upon the more uniform combustion\n\nprovided for in the simulated fluidized-bed experiments.\n\n  A comparison of laboratory and field test results is presented in\n\nTable 3.\n This comparison is complicated by the difficulty of conducting\n\nchemical analysis for specific toxic materials within an overwhelming organic\n\nmatrix as background.\n Both laboratory and field studies were subject to this difficulty.\n As a result, the joint program concentrated upon detection of\n\nspecific toxins contained in a generic \" target list\".\n These toxins are enumerated in Table 3.\n Compounds were selected based upon toxicity, suspected prevalence in\n\nsewage sludge, and representativeness of different classes of potential\n\npollutants.\n Compounds were also added to the target list based upon their\n\ndetection in a preliminary round of laboratory testing of sludges from the\n\nfour test sites, which was completed before full-scale testing was begun.\n This initial testing allowed for the addition of major \" site\n\nspecific\" emissions to the generic \" target list\".\n\n\n\n  Our previous laboratory studies of the oxidative pyrolysis of\n\npure tetrachloroethylene showed that carbon tetrachloride is formed as a PIC\n\n( 15).\n These experiments also showed that, given a hydrogen source,\n\ntrichloroethylene was readily formed as a PIC from tetrachloroethylene.\n The radical pool generated during the incineration of municipal\n\nsludge would provide such a source of hydrogen.\n Thus, if tetrachloroethylene were present in a sludge stream to be\n\nincinerated, these two products would likely be compounds detected in the\n\nstack.\n Full-scale data generated at this site correlated with this\n\nlaboratory finding; tetrachloroethylene was present in the sludge feed, and\n\ncarbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene were found in the stack effluent.\n However, tetrachloroethylene was not detected in the sludge feed\n\nsample furnished for laboratory testing, as evidenced by its absence in the\n\n300 C transport analysis of the sludge sample.\n Thus, an explanation for the absence in laboratory data of these two\n\nemissions is the absence of tetrachloroethylene in the sludge feed.\n This argument may be extended to explain the lack of observation of\n\nany other chlorinated products.\n Since no chlorine-containing compounds were identified in the sludge\n\nfeed, there was no source of chlorine for the formation of chlorinated\n\nproducts.\n\n  Finally, tetrachloroethylene and chloroform were reportedly\n\ncontaminants of the scrubber water used at this facility.\n It is very likely that stripping of both these compounds from the\n\nwater during the scrubbing process contributed to their emissions in the\n\nstack.\n Therefore, these two compounds would not be expected in the emissions\n\nfrom thermal testing performed in the laboratory.\n\n\n  In the feed samples collected during full-scale testing from Site\n\n2, two chlorinated compounds, methylene chloride and chlorobenzene were found\n\nwhich were not detected in the sample provided for laboratory testing In\n\nprevious laboratory experiments, we have found that 1,1-dichloroethylene,\n\n1,2- dichloroethylene, and trichloroethylene were all formed as products from\n\nthe pyrolytic decomposition of pure methylene chloride ( 16)- .\n Thus, it is not surprising that a facility incinerating sludge\n\ncontaminated with methylene chloride had these compounds present in its\n\nemissions.\n Since no methylene chloride was present in the sludge feed sample\n\nreceived for laboratory testing, detection of these compounds could not be\n\nexpected.\n\n  The chlorobenzene emissions detected in the stack effluent of\n\nthis facility probably resulted from a combination of two processes.\n The first is the original contamination found in the sludge feed.\n Previous studies have shown chlorobenzene to be a very stable\n\ncompound, even when decompoSed as part of a mixture ( 17,18)-.\n Thus, the appearance of chlorobenzene in the stack is probably due in\n\npart to its ability to undergo relatively harsh thermal exposures and escape\n\nunscathed.\n\n  The second contribution to the emission of chlorobenzene at the\n\nfull- scale facility is the possibility that this compound was formed as a\n\nPIC.\n We have conducted many studies involving the decomposition of benzene\n\nand/or toluene or related compounds in the presence of chlorinated species.\n The free chlorine radicals generated in such a reaction atmosphere\n\nhave host of chlorine- containing compounds were detected in the sludge feed\n\nat the full-scale facility, it is logical that chlorobenzene was detected in\n\nthe stack.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e25ed425-a09b-425b-b08e-bb52ee73528f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.901256+00:00"}
{"text": "Four times in the last five innings Wednesday, the Bozeman Bucks\n\nAA baseball team got their leadoff man on base against the Billings Scarlets.\n But the Bucks managed to score only once in those five frames as the\n\nScarlets beat Bozeman 5-1 in Class AA conference action at Legion Field.\n\n  Both teams got solid pitching from their starters, but the\n\nScarlets scored once in both the second and third innings before posting two\n\nruns in the fourth and adding another run in the fifth off Bozeman starter\n\nMark Bolin.\n Bolin went the distance for the Bucks in the losing cause while\n\nBillings starter Casey Reichenberg gave up one run on five hits in seven\n\ninnings of work for the victory. \n\n  Despite the loss, Bozeman coach Shane Miller wasn't too\n\ndisappointed with his squad 's effort against the defending AA state\n\nchampions.\n The Bucks beat the Scarlets 9-8 Tuesday night on Josh Huey 's\n\nninth-inning solo home run to earn a split. \n\n  \" I thought our pitching was pretty effective although we did make\n\na few errors in the field,\" Miller said.\n\n\n  \" I'm pretty proud of m 'mguys and the way they played against the\n\nstate champs these last two days.\" \n\n  Bozeman ( 20-9 overall, 6-3 conference) threatened in the bottom\n\nof the ninth when shortstop Jesse Miller led off with a single to center and\n\nadvanced to second on a wild pitch with no outs.\n But Billings reliever Kyle McBride retired the next three Bozeman\n\nbatters in order to secure the victory for the Scarlets ( 36-7, 10-3). \n\n  Billings coach Paul Hatzell felt his team could have put the\n\nBucks away early in the game, but credited his pitchers and team defense for\n\nholding Bozeman to just one run. \n\n  \" We went 1-2-3 in the first inning, but then left eight guys on\n\nbase in the next four innings, so our hitters didn't produce the way I would\n\nhave liked,\" Hatzell said.\n \" I told our guys they have to maintain their focus through all nine\n\ninnings.\n We weren't very disciplined at the plate, but we had good pitching\n\nand defense and that was the difference.\" \n\n  Reichenberg 's offspeed pitches gave Bozeman batters trouble all\n\nday.\n Bucks third baseman Adam Lawson tripled in the bottom of the first,\n\nbut Reichenberg retired the Bucks in order in the second, third and fourth\n\nframes. \n\n  Bozeman 's leadoff batter, second baseman Jake Phillips, scored\n\nthe Bucks only run in the bottom of the sixth after singling to right field\n\nand advancing to third on a wild pitch and a fielder 's choice.\n When Zach Weidenaar hit a soft grounder to third, Lawson, who reached\n\non a fielder 's choice, got caught in a rundown between second and third.\n Phillips scored before Lawson was tagged out at second to end the\n\ninning, making the score 5-1 Scarlets. \n\n  Despite giving up hits to the leadoff batter in the fifth, sixth\n\nand seventh innings, Reichenberg was confident he and the Scarlets could work\n\nout of those jams unscathed. \n\n  \" I felt good; I was switching up my pitches pretty well and once\n\nwe got the lead, I felt really comfortable,\" Reichenberg said.\n \" Once we scored some runs, I just wanted to throw strikes and let\n\nthe defense do the work.\" \n\n  Billings' big inning came in the top of the fourth when the\n\nScarlets got two runs on two hits, a walk, a sacrifice fly and two Bozeman\n\nerrors. \n\n  However, after the Scarlets posted a run in the fifth, Bolin shut\n\nBillings down over the final four innings.\n He retired the Scarlets in order in the sixth, seventh and eight\n\ninnings, before giving up a harmless infield single in the ninth. \n\n  Mike Wardell led the Scarlets at the plate, going 2-for-4 with a\n\nrun scored and a run batted in while Huey went 2-for-4 to lead Bozeman 's\n\noffense. \n\n\n\n\n  The last of three boys involved in the vandalism of Bozeman High\n\nSchool last fall was sentenced in Gallatin County District Court\n\nWednesday.\n\n  Though he signed off on a plea agreement with the prosecution\n\nMichael Roy Oltman, 18, got more than he bargained for after admitting to\n\nDistrict Court Judge Mike Salvagni that he drank alcohol at a friend 's\n\nbirthday party, violating his probation. \n\n  \" Oh, so are special occasions an exception to my order?\"\n\nSalvagni asked. \n\n  Oltman said they weren't.\n But the judge sentenced Oltman to one day in the Gallatin County\n\nDetention Center. \n\n  \" I want him to see the inside of the jail for 24 hours.\n I want him to understand what can happen if he violates the court\n\norder again,\" Salvagni said.\n\n  Oltman was originally charged in October 2000 with felony\n\nburglary, misdemeanor criminal mischief and misdemeanor possession of alcohol\n\nby a minor in connection with an Aug. 29, 2000, break-in and vandalism of the\n\nhigh school.\n\n  Oltman and his friend, Billy Burton, then students at the school,\n\nhad been drinking before they dropped through a broken skylight and set off\n\nfire extinguishers in the school. \n\n  In exchange for his guilty plea, Oltman 's charges were amended to\n\naccountability to burglary, a felony, and accountability to criminal\n\nmischief, a misdemeanor.\n\n\n  Jail time wasn't part of the plea bargain between the prosecution\n\nand the defense.\n\n\n  The agreement called for a two-year deferred sentence for the\n\nburglary charge, and six months suspended for the other two charges.\n Then, if Oltman didn't violate his probation, his felony charge would\n\nbe expunged from his record.\n\n\n  But Salvagni deferred all of the sentenced deferred, giving\n\nOltman the chance to clear his record. \n\n  If he violates the conditions of his deferred sentence, like\n\ndrinking alcohol or taking drugs, the sentence could be revoked and the\n\nprosecution could seek a harsher penalty. \n\n  \" Do you know what the maximum sentence is for burglary?\"\n\nSalvagni asked? \n\n \n\n  Defense attorney Jennifer Bordy pointed out that Oltman was\n\nconstantly being lumped in with the second vandalism to the school, which\n\nhappened a week later during Labor Day weekend, when Burton and Matthew\n\nMitchell caused\n\n&dollar;25,000 in damages to the school.\n\n  \" Except for what happened a week later, no one would have taken\n\nthis as seriously as they have,\" Bordy said.\n \" He made a mistake, a horrible mistake in judgment but he can learn\n\nfrom it and move on.\" \n\n  His first lesson, about the inside of the county jail, started as\n\nsoon as a sheriff 's deputy put Oltman in handcuffs and removed him from the\n\ncourtroom.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Local software company RightNow Technologies is expanding its\n\nglobal arms to encompass a new market. \n\n  The company, which makes customer service software for online\n\nbusinesses, has added Japan to its list of business locations. \n\n  \" The Japanese market is one of the largest potential markets\n\noutside the United States,\" said Greg Gianforte, RightNow 's chief executive\n\nofficer.\n\n\n  RightNow is already operating in several European markets, as\n\nwell as Australia, but none of those locations posed the language and\n\ncultural problems the company faced in Japan. \n\n  After months of working with Basis Technology, a\n\nMassachusetts-based company that specializes in making Internet companies\n\ninternational, RightNow 's software will hit the Japanese marketplace by\n\nmid-July, said Mike Myer, RightNow 's vice president of development. \n\n  \" We worked with an outside party who are experts in converting,\"\n\nMyer said. \" They took our software and produced a Japanese version.\" \n\n  Moving into Japan is an important step for any company on the\n\nWeb, said Ed Schwalenberg of Basis Technology. \n\n  \" The big thing, of course, is the Japanese market is expanding\n\nso fast, it 's the natural next step,\" Schwalenberg said.\n\n\n  When they see the site, they should be able to read it in their\n\nlanguage.\n\n  \" We've be 'veworking on internationalizing the product since\n\nFebruary,\" Myer said.\n \" It 's a four-month project.\n\n\n  He declined to give an exact figure for the cost of converting\n\nRightNow 's software from English to Japanese.\n But he said part of the difficulty is the difference in the size of\n\nthe language.\n\n  \" Although RightNow was already shipping in European languages,\n\nall of those have small alphabets of about 250 characters,\" Schwalenberg\n\nsaid.\n\n\n  Making sure the search engine can read the language used in\n\nkeyword searches is also an important part of the conversion.\n\n  \" In Japanese there are no spaces between the words,\" Myer said.\n\n\n\n  He explained that with the English-based software if a person\n\ntypes the word \" carpet\" into the search engine the computer knows to look\n\nfor that particular word and not the words \" car\" and \" pet\" because there\n\nisn't a space.\n\n\n  To solve that problem, Basis Technology makes the Japanese\n\nMorphological Analyzer, a product that dissects the text and then determines\n\nwhere word breaks should be. \n\n  \" It parses through the Japanese and finds out where the words\n\nare,\" Schwalenberg said. \n\n  To enter the Japanese market, RightNow has partnered with Mitsui\n\nand Co., the largest \" trading company\" in Japan, which means it represents\n\nnon-Japanese companies in the Japanese market, Gianforte said. \n\n  Mitsui is in the process of introducing the product in Japan and\n\nhas hired seven employees that are dedicated to RightNow. \n\n  \" The Japanese marketplace relies heavily on relationships,\"\n\nGianforte said. \" Essentially, ( Mitsui is) RightNow Technologies in Japan.\"\n\n\n\n  While some of RightNow 's competitors have already made the move\n\nto the Japanese market, Gianforte said none have done so as completely as\n\nRightNow.\n\n  \" Our normal

{"text": "ABSTRACT--An experimental approach was used to examine the\n\npotential importance of nutrient limitation and competition on early\n\nsuccessional development in Southern Appalachian forests.\n Treatments included tree removal, herb-shrub removal or NPK\n\nfertilization on 12 x 12 m plots established within a 20-ha clear-cut.\n A reciprocal increase in primary productivity following tree or\n\nherb-shrub removal suggests competition between these vegetation components.\n ) exhibited greater\n\ngrowth following herb- shrub removal.\n biomass increased\n\nsignificantly in the absence of trees.\n Herbaceous and tree productivity both increased following\n\nfertilization, indicating nutrient limitation during early succession.\n ) and red maple (\n\n Acer rubrum  ) had significantly greater productivity in fertilized\n\nareas than in control areas; other tree species were unaffected.\n spp.) in\n\nthe 2nd yr of succession was restricted to fertilized plots.\n in fertilized areas apparently\n\nlimited  Robinia  production.\n ) and\n\npokeweed (  Phytolacca americana  ) were important in woody removal\n\nplus fertilization treatments.\n These findings suggest that competition and nutrient limitation\n\ninteract in controlling species composition.\n relative productivity and time of species occurrence during early\n\nsuccession in the Southern Appalachians.\n\n\n  Early successional vegetation is often important in retaining\n\nnutrients following disturbances such as fire and clear-cutting ( Marks and\n\nBormann, 1972; Vitousek and Reiners, 1975; Vitousek  et al\n\n ., 1979; Gorham  et al  ., 1979; Shure and\n\nPhillips, 1987; Phillips and Shure, 1990).\n Nutrient cycling following disturbance in the southern Appalachian\n\nMountains involves an initial rapid loss of nutrients and sediment ( Johnson\n\nand Swank, 1973), followed by a slow return to predisturbance levels.\n Much of this temporal decline in nutrient losses is attributed to the\n\nrapid regrowth of vegetation.\n Aboveground vegetation net primary productivity ( NPP) reaches Ca.\n\n20% of precutting levels in the 1st yr of succession.\n In contrast, aboveground nutrient pools in biomass reach Ca. 30-40%\n\nof precut levels ( Boring  et al  ., 1981).\n Factors which affect the rate of recovery to normal nutrient cycles\n\ninclude cutting method ( Vitousek and Matson, 1984, 1985), rate of vegetation\n\nregrowth ( Marks, 1974; Boring  et al  ., 1981) and the\n\nrelative importance of nitrogen-fixing plants which replenish nutrients (\n\nBoring  et al  ., 1981; Boring and Swank, 1984a;\n\nMontagnini  et al  ., 1986).\n\n  Stump sprouts and herb-shrub growth dominate early succession in\n\nSouthern Appalachian forests ( Boring  et al  ., 1981;\n\nPhillips and Shure, 1990)- Herbaceous vegetation grows rapidly and sequesters\n\nnutrients which would otherwise be lost from the system.\n Sprouts remobilize underground nutrient reserves and quickly\n\nre-establish the aboveground vegetation structure ( Boring  et al\n\n ., 1981).\n (\n\nMarks and Bormann, 1972; Marks, 1974) in the Northeast and  Robinia\n\npseudo-acacia  sprouts in the Southern Appalachians ( Boring and Swank,\n\n1984a), retain nutrients through rapid growth or add nitrogen to the system\n\nvia nitrifying bacteria.\n Changes in soil nutrient levels in the first years after disturbance\n\nmay influence the order of occurrence and amount of plant biomass in\n\nparticular systems ( Rice  et al  ., 1960; Parrish and\n\nBazzaz, 1982; Tilman, 1986).\n\n  The co-occurrence of early ( herb-shrub) and late ( tree)\n\nsuccessional species in pioneer stages of recovery in the Southern\n\nAppalachians affords an opportunity to evaluate possible competitive\n\ninteractions between these contrasting vegetation types.\n The present study was initiated to determine the interactions between\n\nherb-shrub and tree species during early succession and to examine the\n\neffects of nutrient levels on these interactions.\n\n\n  We conducted the study in a 20-ha forest opening in the southern\n\nAppalachian Mountains near Highlands, N.C.\n The site is at an elevation of 930-1100 m with a 30-40% slope and a\n\nNW-facing aspect.\n The study site was logged from autumn 1983 through spring, 1984.\n )\n\nand tulip poplar (  Liriodendron tulipifera  ) .\n Rainfall in the vicinity averages 181 cm/yr.\n\n\n  The experimental design included fertilization and vegetation (\n\nwoody or herb) removal treatments.\n Twelve 12 x 12 m plots were established randomly within the clear-cut\n\nin June 1984.\n All plot sites had equivalent amounts of logging slash present.\n Four plots each had either woody vegetation ( trees) or herb-shrub (\n\nhereafter called herb) vegetation removed monthly throughout the 1984 and\n\n1985 growing seasons; four plots were left as controls ( reference plots).\n Two of the four plots in each set, including reference plots, were\n\nfertilized.\n Fertilizer ( 13:13:13 NPK, slow N release) was applied by hand at an\n\namount equivalent to 500 kg/ha during July 1984 and in early June and\n\nmid-August 1985.\n\n  Tree biomass estimates were made by identifying, tagging and\n\nmeasuring the basal diameters of all stems on the eight plots with trees.\n Measurements were obtained after the completion of the 1984 ( 1st yr\n\nof succession) and 1985(2nd yr) growing seasons.\n The sprout measurements were converted into biomass ( leaf, wood and\n\ntotal) using regression equations derived from a similar clear-cut in the\n\nnearby Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, N.C. ( Boring and Swank, 1984a).\n Net primary productivity for all tree species was determined as the\n\ntotal ( leaf + wood) biomass at the end of the second growing season minus\n\nthe wood biomass present from the previous year.\n ) ,\n\nred maple (  Acer rubrum  ) , black locust (  Robinia\n\npseudo-acacia  ) , dogwood (  Cornus fiorica  ) and tulip\n\npoplar (  Liriodendron tulipifera  ) , were chosen for detailed\n\nexamination.\n\n  Herbaceous biomass samples were harvested from the central 10 x\n\n10 m area of the eight herb plots to minimize edge effects.\n Six randomly selected 0.5 m2 samples were collected from each plot on\n\n23-24 September 1984, and on 7-9 July, 12-15 August and 12-16 September 1985.\n Samples were sorted to genus or species, oven-dried at 80 C until\n\nreaching constant weight ( 24 h) and weighed.\n Community net primary productivity was calculated by summing woody\n\nspecies NPP and the peak biomass of each herb taxon.\n\n  Statistical analysis used one-way, nested ANOVA ( n = 48) in\n\ntesting for treatment effects ( Kirchner, 1977).\n For the tree analysis, each plot was subdivided into six equal\n\nsubplots.\n was analyzed using the whole plot as replicates\n\nbecause of nonhomogeneous variances.\n Herb analysis used the six harvest samples per plot.\n Analysis of variance was perfomed on total biomass and leaf biomass\n\nfor the tree species, and on total herb biomass, blackberry,  Aster \n\n,  Solidago  and the remaining biomass ( after blackberry, \n\nAster  and  Solidago  had been removed).\n Aboveground biomass growth was minimal (\n\napproximately 5 g m-2) during the 1st yr following disturbance ( Fig. 1).\n Tree biomass increased 15-40 fold ( 115-190 gm-2) by the end of the\n\n2nd growing season.\n Less than 1% of the sterns were advance regeneration seedlings or\n\nsaplings that survived the cut.\n Leaf biomass was similar in all treatments ( F = 1.12, P = 0.35,\n\n1984; F = 1.77, P = 0.17, 1985) and averaged 61% of total tree biomass during\n\n1984, and 36% in 1985 ( Fig. 1).\n However, tree biomass was somewhat higher in the herb-removal,\n\nfertilized plots ( HR + F) by the end of the 2nd yr.\n\n  Treatment effects were present for several tree species in 1985 (\n\nFig. 2).  Robinia  , the most important sprouter, had significantly\n\ngreater aboveground biomass ( F = 3.15, P\n\n< 0.05) in herb removal (HR and HR + F) t han reference plots Nutrient\n\nenrichment without herb removal ( F) had a negative effect on  Robinia\n\n biomass.\n growth was significantly\n\nincreased ( F = 3.94, P < 0.05, 1984; F = 3.44) P \n\n< 0.05, l985~ in fertilized areas both ye ars, whereas  Acer  had\n\nsomewhat greater growth ( total-F = 1.14, P > 0.2; leaves-F = 2,80, 0.05 < F \n\n< 0.1) in plots receiving fertilizer plus herb-removal treatments.\n growth was slightly depressed in all treatment\n\nplots.\n biomass was similar on treatment and reference\n\nplots.\n\n  Tree sprout densities were relatively stable by the end of the\n\n1st growing season ( Table 1).\n Total stem densities increased slightly from 1984 to 1985 on all but\n\nthe fertilized ( F) areas.\n Stem densities of four of the five major species actually decreased\n\nduring the 2nd yr in fertilized plots.\n exhibited opposite responses\n\nin treated vs.\n generally had greater biomass per\n\nstem, whereas  Cornus  had higher densities of smaller sprouts on\n\ntreated than control areas ( Table 1, Fig. 2).\n\n\n  The herbaceous community was well-established during the 1st\n\ngrowing season ( Fig. 3).  Aster  and  Solidago  were both\n\nimportant species though no major treatment effects were evident.\n Total herbaceous biomass was significantly higher ( July: F = 4.94, P\n\n= 0.005; August: F = 6.03, P = 0.002; September: F = 4.46, P = 0.008) in\n\nfertilized than reference plots throughout the 2nd yr.\n spp.) was responsible for most of this\n\nenrichment effect.  Rubus  comprised 40-55% of the herbaceous\n\nbiomass in fertilized plots, but was nearly absent in reference and woody\n\nremoval ( WR) plots.\n Herbaceous biomass was also somewhat elevated in woody removal plots\n\nby the end of the 2nd growing season.\n accounted for much of this increase, particularly in\n\nSeptember ( F = 2.63, F = 0~06).\n biomass was occasionally higher in woody removal\n\nareas.\n The remaining herbs had significantly higher biomass in the woody\n\nremoval + fertilization ( WR + F) than reference plots in August ( F = 6.93,\n\nP = 0.0006) and September ( F = 3.66, P = 0.02) 1985.\n\n  The experimental treatments promoted distinct changes in\n\ncommunity net primary productivity by the end of the 2nd growing season (\n\nFig. 4).\n NPP of fertilized plots ( F) increased 49.5% over that of reference\n\nplots as a result of greater herb production.\n Woody vegetation production increased slightly above reference plots\n\nin the absence of herbaceous vegetation, particularly following\n\nfertilization.\n Herbaceous vegetation showed a similar compensatory response in the\n\nabsence of woody vegetation.\n Fertilization increased herbaceous production even further, although\n\nthe fertilizer effect was similar in the presence or absence of woody\n\nvegetation ( F vs. WR + F).\n\n\n  Forest openings in the southern Appalachian Mountains usually\n\nhave high levels of available nutrients due to rapid decomposition of the\n\ndebris remaining after logging ( Boring  et al  ., 1981;\n\nSeastedt and Crossley, 1981).\n The extent of this nutrient release may have a significant impact on\n\nrevegetation processes.\n\n\nshowed a positive response to the addition of fertilizer; the biomass or\n\nseveral other tree species was unaffected.\n Thus, there is evidence for differential nutrient limitation among\n\ntree species present in the 1st 2 yr following disturbance.\n Tilman ( 1985, 1986, 1988) has demonstrated how differential nutrient\n\nusage by plants can lead either to dominance by a single species or to many\n\ncoexisting species in the community.\n and\n\n Cornus  , showed equal or less growth in fertilized ( F) than\n\nreference ( C) areas.\n may outcompete these\n\nspecies in highly enriched areas.\n\n  Stump sprouts comprise most of the aboveground biomass in the\n\nearly years of succession in the southern Appalachian Mountains ( Boring\n\n et al  ., 1981; Phillips and Shure, 1990).\n Tree biomass exceeded herb biomass by the end of the 2nd yr after\n\ndisturbance- Most of the 15-40 fold increase in tree biomass was from\n\nexisting sprouts and not new recruitment, since stem density did not change\n\nappreciably over this 2-yr period.\n Stem densities in our areas ( 12,256 to 19,513 ha-1) were much higher\n\nthan in a 7-yr-old clear-cut ( 9654 ha-') and uncut forest ( 3042 ha-') in\n\nnearby areas in North Carolina ( Johnson and Swank, 1973).\n Pronounced competition apparently occurs among the tree species\n\nduring the successional process.\n\n  Competition also exists to some degree between the co-occurring\n\nherb and tree vegetation.\n Total tree biomass was only slightly elevated in the absence of\n\nherbs.\n , a nitrogen-fixing legume ( Boring and Swank,\n\n1984a, b), was the only tree species which increased in biomass following\n\nherb removal.\n In contrast, herb biomass and productivity increased in the 2nd\n\ngrowing season following woody sprout removal.\n were the principal\n\nbeneficiaries.\n The remaining herb species did not change much in species composition\n\nor biomass.\n ) and\n\npokeweed (  Phytolacca americana  ) biomass increased threefold in\n\nthe woody removal + fertilization ( WR + F) treatment during the 2nd growing\n\nseason.\n\n  begins to develop in the 2nd yr of succession in\n\nthe Southern Appalachians and comprises most of the herb biomass present by\n\nthe 4th yr ( Boring and Swank, I 984a).\n showed the most vigorous response to fertilization,\n\nand was the dominant herb in the fertilized plots during the 2nd yr.\n\n\nfollowing fertilization in spruce plantations in Sweden.\n production was much higher in the\n\nfertilized ( F) than tree removal + fertilized ( WR + F) treatment.\n\n\nprobably accounted for the reduction in Rubus growth in WR + F areas.\n together amounted to\n\nalmost 30% of the herb biomass in WR + F plots vs. 9% in the F treatment.\n was not apparently inhibited by tree species in the\n\nearly stages of succession.\n\n  in the absence of\n\nherbs is believed due to release from  Rubus  competition.\n\n\nbiomass in plots where both species co-occurred.\n during early succession\n\nprobably ceases as  Rubus  dies back with the initial development of\n\na tree canopy- Nonetheless,  Rubus  plays an important functional\n\nrole during early succession in the Southern Appalachians by sequestering\n\nreleased nutrients and inhibiting the initial growth of  Robinia  .\n development can have a\n\nmarked influence on  Robinia  growth and thus N-fixation and\n\nnutrient accretion in these forests following disturbance ( Boring and Swank,\n\n1984a, b).", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a55fda89-54f4-4ed6-82af-c02d620b46bc", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.903714+00:00"}
{"text": "On April 1, 1957, Anne Millicent Cooper gave birth to the only\n\nchild that ever managed to survive the toxic environment of her womb.\n As she sat in her hospital bed, aching, tired and drugged, holding\n\nthat squinched-up piece of human flesh that was at once all-Anne and\n\nnot-Anne, she searched her daughter 's face for some sign.\n Grandma Cooper always said that a person had their name written all\n\nover their face, and a wrongly given name was a tragedy that could twist\n\nsomeone 's personality into improper and disastrous proportions.\n After the horrible events of November 1963, Grandma Cooper claimed\n\nthat Lee Harvey Oswald 's mother hadn't read his face right and so was to\n\nblame for the events that had led him down the path to assassination. \n\n  Anne sat, cranky from exertion, and marveled at the fact that her\n\nbaby had not yet cried.\n Even when the doctor had whacked her a good one to give her breath,\n\nthe baby had merely hiccuped with dignity and slowly turned from blue to pink\n\nwithout a sound.\n Even now the baby lay quietly, her steely eyes focusing on Anne with\n\nsuch intensity that it gave her the creeps. \n\n  Years later, when Grandma would scold Anne for naming that\n\nchangeling baby wrong, Anne thought back to that Fools' Day and remembered\n\nthe grayness that belonged to the baby 's face, as if the sun had set and\n\nimpressed shadows over her features to leave a darkness that never lifted.\n That shadow had moved Anne, when presented with the birth\n\ncertificate, to carefully print Twilight Cooper.\n No middle name.\n\n\n  Anne had killed three children.\n Least, that 's how Grandma Cooper had seen it, though she'd never\n\nactually use 'dthe word murder.\n Three children, all boys, had been conceived, nurtured, then poisoned\n\nby some agent in Anne 's blood.\n As Anne sat numbly before the doctor while he explained the situation\n\nagain, sat wearing a sanitary pad and belt in order to stop the gush from her\n\nuterus, she envisioned some thief, some spy, sneaking around her body, hiding\n\nin shadows and ducking out of sight until it saw its chance and pounced upon\n\nits prey.\n She was impressed by its cunning and tenacity.\n She did not mourn for these sons, sons that would have grown big and\n\nstrong and masculine.\n\n\n  So once Anne had her Twilight, she and her baby and her mama and\n\nher grandma settled back into their house, on the outskirts of Mason, North\n\nCarolina, and tried to ignore the stares and whispers.\n Nights, Anne would sit by the window, listening to the radio, and\n\nwish for the big city, where a person could get lost in the crowd.\n Who would know who the bastards were?\n\n\n  Grandma Cooper said the word bastard referred to those who used\n\nit, not those at whom it was aimed, but Anne noticed that Grandma stopped\n\ngoing into town in the company of her family of women after Twilight was\n\nborn.\n Grandma seemed slightly afraid of Twilight, as did others.\n When she grew older, Twilight could enter a room and the waves would\n\npart as they did for Moses.\n Grandma would stand in her kitchen, scrubbing the dishes and watching\n\nthat spook child do her homework at the table, but if Twilight looked up or\n\nspoke, Grandma would avert her eyes.\n Twilight was born with that witchy color of blonde-white hair, which\n\nsilvered as she grew.\n Anne read up on hair colors and dyes, but Twilight simply shook her\n\nhead as if that dismissed the subject.\n\n\n  Anne 's mama, Ruth, was the only person in all of Mason who was\n\nnot the least bit afraid of Twilight, who could look her in the eye, could\n\ntell her no, could raise her voice to her.\n Then again, Ruth wasn't afraid of anybody, said fear was a waste of\n\ntime that didn't serve anyone except them that wanted to be feared.\n Anne wondered if that included her daughter, if Twilight liked the\n\neffect she had on others.\n Anne never had the nerve to ask, and Twilight never offered.\n When Twilight was ten years old, she left home.\n She and Grandma Cooper were watching a game show, and Twilight simply\n\ngot up from the couch, crossed to the front door, and left. \n\n  Grandma didn't bother to sound the alarm until the next morning,\n\nwhen Anne went to wake Twilight for school. \n\n  \" She ain't here.\n\n\n  \" What?\n\n\n \n\n  Grandma Cooper sounded so calm that Anne almost forgot to be\n\nupset.\n\n\n<p 'd Grandma Cooper shrugged.\n\n\n \n\n  Twilight was found the next day in Smithfield.\n Somehow she had managed to travel more than twenty miles down Highway\n\n40.\n When asked by annoyed policemen and her bewildered mama and\n\nexasperated Ruth, Twilight shrugged.\n Didn't matter how she got there.\n Only Grandma Cooper agreed with her.\n\n\n  And Anne supposed she was, although her scrutiny of her daughter\n\nincreased in intensity.\n Over the next couple of weeks, she watched her as if watching a\n\nstranger, as if examining a paramecium under a microscope.\n Her clinical thinking about her flesh and blood didn't disturb her;\n\nhow else should someone think about their kin?\n\n\n  And so Twilight grew, doing as she pleased with the calm belief\n\nthat that was the way it should be, bewildered by others' reactions to her\n\nwillfulness.\n She did not comprehend how someone else could decide how it was\n\nproper for her to behave.\n She lived in the world behind her shadowed face and steely eyes, and\n\nno one had ever been invited inside.\n No amount of force parted those doors, either, though Ruth bullied\n\nand cajoled.\n Anne simply watched, her hound-dog eyes testimony to her child 's\n\nstrangeness.\n Grandma Cooper kept a wide berth around Twilight and only reacted if\n\nthe girl was disrespectful toward her.\n\n\n  As a teenager, Twilight was fascinated by the physical difference\n\nbetween herself and the other Cooper women.\n Grandma Cooper was tall and thick-boned, exuding an air of strength.\n Her gray hair still held hints of its former ebony color.\n Her skin was dark and tough from years of sun and hard work.\n Ruth resembled her mother, big and sturdy and dark.\n Anne was paler but in all other ways was Ruth 's daughter.\n\n\n  Twilight was thin, all angles and bones, and small.\n Her heart beat within her chest like a fluttery bird, and if she\n\nlooked in the mirror after removing her bra, she could see the movement of\n\nits wings underneath her skin.\n Her hair was white-blonde-gray, and she seemed fragile, breakable\n\nnext to the workhorse women of her family.\n Yet wire and steel and bone reinforced her, and she would not break.\n\n\n\n  Despite the differences that could only come from genetics,\n\nTwilight never asked about her father.\n The Cooper understanding was that she had no father, and even after\n\nshe learned the facts of life from Becky Carlson, the perky snubnosed\n\ncheerleader in her American Lit class, Twilight did not ask from whose sperm\n\nshe had come.\n It really did not matter.\n Twilight, as she watched children in town with their daddies, knew\n\nrelating to a father would be as foreign as committing that act that Becky\n\nhad whispered about, to be hot and messy and sweaty and connected to another\n\nhuman being.\n\n\n \n\n  Twilight also differed from the other Cooper women in temperament\n\nand desire.\n She shunned Grandma 's Bible, Ruth 's relish for housekeeping, Anne 's\n\nlongings, for something better, something bigger.\n She could feel her eyes glass over when Anne talked of the big city\n\nor Grandma quoted Bible verses at her.\n But one day, when Twilight was fourteen, Grandma 's religion\n\npenetrated.\n Twilight had once again aggravated Ruth to the point of rage and had\n\nridden the wave of Ruth 's loud words into the living room, where she found\n\nGrandma Cooper seated on the couch.\n She was hunched over the Bible in her lap, rocking.\n Twilight started out the front door when Grandma 's words stopped her.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Twilight turned and fixed her steely eyes on Grandma.\n \" Excuse me?\u001d\n \" You see the world as those who have not found God, in shadow.\u001d\n \" Yes, yes I do.\u001d\n Twilight disappeared out the door, not hearing or not caring to hear\n\nthe admonishment in Grandma Cooper 's words.\n As she walked down the dirt road that extended from the Cooper house\n\ninto Mason, she twisted the words around in her head.\n Yes, the world did seem dark to her, but wasn't it, truly?\n\n\n  Twilight met a man when she was seventeen, the chance meeting\n\nbeing the catalyst that would start her motors, that would start the\n\npropulsion that would move her far, far away from the Cooper land, from\n\nMason, from the South.\n His name was Wilson Carpenter, and she first caught wind of him in\n\nthe drug store after school one day in the fall of her senior year.\n She had stopped in for a soda and was seated at the counter, reading\n\nWilliam Blake, when she heard the voices of Ethel Milton and Rosemary Helms.\n\n\n  Rosemary was Reverend Helms 's wife.\n So Twilight listened, pretending to read, and heard them talking\n\nabout \" that new fellow.\" \n\n  \" Just moved in last night,\" Ethel was saying.\n Ethel owned the town 's boarding house and so was usually the first\n\nto meet any newcomer, since Mason did not boast a hotel.\n Twilight supposed Ethel 's nature and the job had drawn together like\n\nmagnets.\n Gossips were well suited to live among the hub of the town 's\n\nhappenings and in fact were happy no place else. \n\n  \" Only brought one suitcase.\n Small little thing.\n And so I asked him if he was having the rest of his things sent and\n\ndo you know, he said there wasn't any more.\n I mean I know men aren't the same about belongings, but really.\n\n\n From her seat, Twilight could hear Rosemary 's murmur, and she\n\nstrained to listen. \n\n  Ethel continued.\n \" Yes, I know.\n Charming young man, too.\n So handsome.\n And you know it 's rare that a young man would want to teach.\n\n\n  Rosemary spoke again, and though Twilight tried, she could not\n\nhear the woman 's words.\n\n\n  \" Well, yes, I guess you're 'reht, but it would be different if\n\nhe was older.\u001d\n Twilight wondered where Ethel supposed older male teachers came\n\nfrom, if sixty-year-old businessmen suddenly got the urge to teach Algebra to\n\npimply-faced junior high kids.\n\n\n  \" Well, there 's still time for that,\" Rosemary said, speaking\n\nmore clearly.\n And Twilight silently praised her: Atta girl, Rosemary, project that\n\nvoice.\n Ethel grumbled.\n A gossip had more fun if the recipient of\n\nwhat-might-turn-out-to-be-scandalous news agreed with her.\n The conversation dwindled as the women began to speak of the\n\nupcoming church bazaar, and Twilight tuned them out.\n A new man.\n A teacher.\n Probably the lower grades, and probably a math teacher.\n\n\n  The next day, her English teacher, Miss Turner, did not show.\n After ten minutes of no supervision, the class was becoming\n\nrestless.\n Twilight read her book and ignored them, until she heard a deep\n\nvoice above the din.\n \" Excuse me.\n I didn't realize that a teacher 's absence was permission to run\n\namuck.\" \n\n  The class grew silent, staring at this man, the young face that\n\ncould have passed for one of theirs.\n He dropped his briefcase on Miss Turner 's desk with a loud thump\n\nthat even startled the unshakable Twilight.\n \" My name is Mr. Carpenter.\n I have been assigned to this class for the rest of the semester.\n\n\n  Twilight, by carefully listening to Ethel, had learned that Miss\n\nTurner was now resting comfortably in Raleigh, in a bed in a minimum security\n\nward of Dorothea Dix hospital.\n She had had some kind of \" nerve thing,\" according to Ethel.\n Twilight figured it must have been a nervous breakdown and wondered\n\nif it had been student-induced. \n\n  \" Old Turner 's gone loony,\" one of the boys in the back called\n\nout, and there were uncomfortable giggles throughout the room. \n\n  Mr. Carpenter fixed the room with an icy stare.\n \" I will not have such talk in my classroom.\n You will show as much respect to Miss Turner as you will show to me.\n If any smart-aleck thinks he can best me, then he may leave right\n\nnow.\n I will not play a game of wills with this class, and anyone who\n\nattempts to rattle me will find his own cage rattled.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

 We were attempting to give the reader a clearer picture of cash\n\nflow generated from ongoing operations.\n We are privately owned, but we have public bond debt.\n We have had to borrow against our line of credit in the past to cover\n\nthe interest on our bond debt.\n Because of this, the bondholders have continued to monitor our cash\n\nflow from operations against the cash flow required to service debt.\n By discussing Operating expenses before depreciation, pre-opening\n\nexpense, related party royalties expense, and loss on disposal of asset?, we\n\nwere providing them information on the cash generated by ongoing operations\n\nbetween the two periods.\n We chose to exclude related party royalties expense because we are\n\nrestricted against paying the royalties under our debt covenants.\n We also excluded depreciation and loss on disposal of assets because\n\nof their non-cash nature.\n Pre-opening expense was associated with opening of the new facilities\n\nand will not

regarding your exposure to\n\ninterest rate risk do not comply with the requirements of Item 305 of\n\nRegulation S-K.\n Please revise your disclosure in the future filings regarding your\n\nexposure to interest rate risk to provide these disclosures in one of the\n\nformats outlined in Item 305(a) of Regulation S-K. \n\n\n  Our disclosures for future filings in regards to interest rate\n\nrisk will be formatted per Item 305 of Regulation S-K.\n In our recent filing for March 31, 2008, the disclosures were\n\ncorrected to comply with Item 305 of Regulation S-K. \n\n  The following is an excerpt from our company 's March 31, 2008 10Q\n\nfiling: The following discusses our exposure to market risk related to\n\nchanges in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates.\n We do not believe that their respective exposure to market risk is\n\nmaterial.\n\n  Market risk is risk of loss arising from changes in market rates\n\nand prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and\n\ncommodity prices.\n At March 31, 2008, we had\n\n&dollar;130.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, slot equipment\n\npurchase agreements of\n\n&dollar;1.7 million carrying an imputed interest rate of 3.327%, and hotel equipment\n\npurchase agreeme%ts of\n\n&dollar;0.1 million carrying interest rates averaging 11.72%.\n The Note% carry a fixed interest rate of 8.75 %, provided no events\n\nof default%have occurred.\n Since the Notes and equipment purchase agreements have fixed interest\n\nrates, there is no market risk associated with these loans other than fair\n\nvalue market risk, which we believe to be insignificant.\n We have market risk associated with funds that may be borrowed on the\n\n&dollar;15.0 million Credit Facility, due to an interest rate that floats with the\n\nLIBOR or prime rate.\n The term of the Credit Facility will mature on March 30, 2009.\n At March 31, 2008,\n\n&dollar;6.4 million was outstanding under the variable rate Credit Facility,\n\ncarrying interest at 6.52%.\n Assuming a 100 basis-point change in LIBOR at March 31, 2008 and\n\nassuming no change in the funds borrowed on the\n\n&dollar;15.0 million Credit Facility, our annual interest cost would change by\n\napproximately\n\n&dollar;64,000. \n\n  We do not have any significant foreign currency exchange rate\n\nrisk or

Participation Fees, page 57\n\n  With respect to your participation fees paid to slot machine\n\nmanufacturers, we note that you classify these payments as reduction of\n\nrevenue.\n However, it appears that industry practice is to recognize these\n\nparticipating fees as an expense, rather than a reduction of revenue.\n Refer to the guidance in Section 2.11 of the AICPA Audit & Accounting\n\nGuide for Casinos.\n Please advise us or revise this classification in the future filings,\n\naccordingly. \n\n\n  We will revise the classification in future filings as suggested.\n The argument for recording these fees as a reduction of revenue is\n\nnot without merit, however. \n\n  In addition to the AICPA audit guide there is other literature\n\nthat addresses \" gross vs. net\" presentation of revenue.\n Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, Revenue Recognition provides guidance\n\non determining whether a \" gross\" or \" net\" presentation is appropriate.\n The literature indicates that the staff will look to both risk of\n\nloss and principal vs. agency relationship as indicators of the appropriate\n\npresentation.\n Per 101, in assessing whether revenue should be reported gross with\n\nseparate display of cost of sales to arrive at gross profit or on a net\n\nbasis, consideration should be given to whether the registrant; ( 1) acts as\n\nprincipal in the transaction, ( 2) takes title to the products, ( 3) has\n\nrisks and rewards of ownership, such as the risk of loss for collection,\n\ndelivery, or returns, and ( 4) acts as an agent or broker.\n If the company performs as an agent or broker without assuming the\n\nrisks and rewards of ownership of the goods, sales should be reported on a\n\nnet basis. \n\n  The AICPA audit guide indicates that most casinos show a gross\n\npresentation for the participation revenues.\n However, it does not specifically require this presentation.\n Additional, this literature was published in 1994.\n Since that time the nature of participation arrangements have changed\n\nsubstantially.\n Those changes are summarized below: In the past, many casinos had\n\nonly a few participation machines on the floor.\n We have over 15% parti%ipation machines on the casino floor and\n\nparticipation fees represent about 10% of sl%t revenue. \n\n  The average participation term is flexible and we can move and\n\nreplace machines at will.\n This indicates that some of the risks of ownership are not present.\n\n\n\n  Resent legislation in the State of Nevada has changes the tax\n\nburden related to participation revenues.\n In prior years, the casino was responsible for the tax burden on the\n\ngross revenue.\n Under the new legislation, the casino and slot manufacturer share the\n\ntax burden for the gross win gaming tax. \n\n  Many of the participation agreements have elements of a\n\ncontribution to a wide-area progressive ( based on a % of co%n-in).\n This wide-area progressive jackpot, when hit, will be funded by the\n\nslot manufacturer out of this contribution.\n In addition, part of the participation fee has elements of a lease\n\npayment ( because the machine is owned by the manufacturer) and elements of\n\nthird party license arrangements ( because the manufacturer owns the software\n\nfor the game). \n\n  As a result of these facts, many casinos present revenues from\n\nparticipation on a net basis. \n\n  Currently the AICPA audit guide is being updated by a committee\n\nof ACSEC.\n According to one of the members, the new guide will be out in draft\n\nform soon.\n They will take the position that these elements should be treated\n\ndifferently based on circumstances.\n I believe that they will propose either net revenue or an expense\n\ndepending on these three classes or elements of the arrangement. \n\n  We will present the participation fees as an expense in future\n\nfilings until this updated guidance is released. \n\n  We note that your have recorded the value of the Hooters\n\ntrademark as an indefinite lived intangible asset and that Florida Hooters\n\nLLC has assigned the right to use this trademark to the company.\n Please tell us the length of the agreement which permits the company\n\nto use the Hooters trademark.\n If the length of the agreement is not indefinite, please tell us why\n\nyou believe it is appropriate to classify the right to use the trademark as\n\nan indefinite lived intangible asset. \n\n\n  The agreement with Florida Hooters LLC has assigned the trademark\n\nrights to our company for an indefinite period of time and the rights are\n\nappropriately classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset.\n In accordance with SFAS 142, \" Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\",\n\nthe Company tests for impairment of the asset on an annual basis to maintain\n\nthe accuracy of our reporting. \n\n  From a news article dated April 25, 2008, it is our understanding\n\nthat Moody 's downgraded your public notes to junk bonds status.\n Therefore, please expand future filings to completely and clearly\n\ndiscuss and analyze the impact and consequences of this matter on the\n\ncompany 's cash position, liquidity, and its external financing abilities as a\n\nresult of this material change in credit rating.\n\n\n\n  We will discuss the impact of Moody 's downgrade in future\n\nfilings.\n Certainly the rating ( or more importantly, our failure to generate\n\nsufficient cash flow from operations to cover debt service) could affect the\n\ncost of capital in the future.\n Currently it has no effect on our ability to borrow against our\n\n&dollar;15 million line of credit or the interest rate we currently pay on the\n\nbonds. \n\n \n\nDana Price can be reached at 702-597-6052.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5cce6c77-7a33-4819-b571-656c3248f830", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.906557+00:00"}
{"text": "Was Tommy really such a bad boy that his mother had to reject him?\n\n\n  March 8, 1990.\n Low-hanging dark clouds roar across Lake Michigan bringing bleakness\n\nand rain to Chicago.\n Inside a sterile steel and glass building on the near West Side, an\n\nequally bleak scene is playing out.\n Tommy, a small, skinny kid with tousled brown hair and green eyes,\n\nstands beneath an imposing bench, staring up at an equally imposing judge in\n\nblack robes.\n Surrounding Tommy are an assistant state 's attorney, an assistant\n\npublic guardian appointed to act as the boy 's lawyer, his parents, and their\n\nlawyer.\n\n  Tommy bites his lip as he tries to fight back tears.\n Within minutes, the parents who had adopted him six years previously\n\nwill no longer be his parents.\n\n  \" Mr. and Mrs.\n Johnson,\" the judge begins, \" I have been advised that at this time\n\nyou wish to sign a document that is entitled ` final and irrevocable consent\n\nto an adoption.' Is that correct?\"\n\n \n\n  \" Do you each understand that by signing this document you are\n\ngiving up any and all parental rights to Thomas?\" the judge asks slowly.\n\n  In reply, the Johnsons grab a pen and quickly sign the\n\ndocument.\n\n  Tommy 's lawyer asks the judge if the boy can talk to him.\n Eleven-year-old Tommy has an eight-year-old brother, Rick, still at\n\nhome with the Johnsons, she says.\n Tommy loves his brother and wants to maintain a relationship with\n\nhim.\n But the judge refuses to talk to the boy.\n The lawyer pleads that the judge order the Johnsons to permit\n\nvisitation between their ex-son and their present son.\n But the judge refuses, saying that any such order would be \"\n\nunenforceable.\"\n\n\n  The lawyer who represented Tommy that day works for me.\n I'm the Public Gu 'mdian of Cook County, which comprises Chicago and\n\nits suburbs.\n Some 115 people, including 55 lawyers, work for my office: Our job is\n\nto try to protect those who are least able to protect themselves--generally\n\nthe elderly and the children.\n\n  As the legal protectors of neglected and abused children in the\n\nJuvenile Court of Cook County, we see a lot of horror stories.\n But few have affected me as much as Tommy 's.\n When my lawyer told me about him, my first reaction was to cry.\n My second was to slug the judge for not ordering visits between Tommy\n\nand his brother.\n\n\n  What I did was to immediately take over Tommy 's case.\n At first, I figured that something had to be very wrong with him for\n\nhis parents to have given him up this way.\n So I checked into his background--the psychological reports,\n\nsocial-work reports, and school reports that cataloged the eleven years of\n\nhis life...\n\n  Tommy and Rick were adopted by Pamela and Joseph Johnson when\n\nTommy was five and Rick, three.\n Before that, the boys' background had been chaotic.\n Sarah, their biological mother, came from an abusive family.\n Though neither she nor the boys' father physically or sexually abused\n\nTommy and Rick, the father seems to have disappeared early or been home only\n\nsporadically.\n Sarah and the boys lived on welfare in one room in a poor\n\nneighborhood on Chicago 's Northwest Side.\n At times, her father, Tommy and Rick 's grandfather, lived with\n\nthem--when he was not in jail.\n Tommy and Rick grew up on candy, soda pop, and potato chips, while\n\ntheir mother lived on cigarettes and drugs.\n\n  Finally, Sarah simply decided she couldn't deal with the boys any\n\nmore and gave them up.\n\n\n  Then in their mid-thirties, the Johnsons were a successful\n\nmiddle-class couple.\n They each owned their won business, as well as cars, a house, a\n\ncamper and campsite.\n But, according to a psychologist who saw the boys and the Johnsons\n\nregularly, \" problems in Tommy 's placement were evident from the\n\nbeginning.\"\n\n  The psychologist observed that, \" the Johnsons-- particularly\n\nMrs.\n Johnson--demonstrated ongoing difficulty in hearing and acknowledging\n\nviewpoints which differ from their own.\"\n He characterized the Johnsons' parenting style as \" quite\n\nrule-oriented and rigid with little encouragement for independent thinking,\n\ndiscussion, and day-to-day problem solving.\" He suggested that the Johnsons\n\nshould become more responsive and flexible in responding to Tommy 's needs; he\n\nconsistently called their attention to their preferential treatment of\n\nRick--a more passive and affectionate child--but they could not, or would\n\nnot, modify their parenting approach.\n\n  When Tommy did not behave as the Johnsons demanded, when he\n\ndidn't fulfill their expectations, they called him untrustworthy, and\n\nincreasingly withdrew their emotional support.\n Then, although Tommy had done generally well in school, he was, at\n\nMrs.\n Johnson 's \" repeated insistence,\" placed in a school for behaviorally\n\ndisordered children.\n\n  Through it all, Tommy and Rick grew closer than ever: The year\n\nafter their adoption, the therapist noted that Rick idolized his older\n\nbrother.\n\n  Imperfect as home life with the Johnsons was, there was some\n\nelement of stability in it for Tommy.\n For more than five years he was part of their family, one of their\n\nsons.\n Then, as he told me, \" One night when I was eating dinner, my mom and\n\ndad were talking about me, and they said they were going to put me up for\n\nadoption.\n I thought they were kidding.\n But they weren't! I was crying, and then they asked my brother is he\n\ngoing to miss me?\n And he said, yeah, he 's going to miss all the fun he had with\n\nme..\"\n\n  Ironically, it was the day before Thanksgiving 1989 when the\n\nJohnsons dropped off their son at Hephzibah, an orphanage in Oak Park, Ill.,\n\nand left him there with not even a backward glance.\n\n  How did Tommy feel?\n I guess the answer is obvious.\n\n\n  On Christmas Eve he and a friend made a tape.\n In it, Tommy expressed his feelings, but perhaps his friend said it\n\nbetter: \" When I heard that he[Tommy] was going to be [ put in the\n\norphanage], I started to cry.\n I said, well buddy, I'm sorry 'm\n .\n .\n but I guess this is what life is about.\n A couple of nights I was so sad and so mad that I cried and cried and\n\ncried when I went to bed.\"\n\n  Tommy made the tape for the Johnsons--but they refused to even\n\nlisten to it.\n And two and a half months later, in March 1990, they returned Tommy,\n\nlike a piece of defective merchandise, back to the court, severing all\n\nconnection with him.\n\n  Within days of the Johnsons' giving Tommy up, my department sued\n\nthem.\n We asked the court to order them to permit Tommy to visit and phone\n\nhis brother.\n The Johnsons argued that the court had no jurisdiction to impose a\n\nfamily situation on them when Tommy was no longer family.\n We countered that brother and sisters had an absolute constitutional\n\nright to each other 's company, which even a parent had no right to sever.\n Motions, memoranda, and squabbles went on before three separate\n\njudges.\n\n  The Johnsons filed legal papers arguing that it was unsafe for\n\nRick to be around Tommy.\n Tommy, they said, had tried to drown Rick while swimming.\n Tommy had hit Rick on the head with a baseball bat.\n Tommy was psychotic; he was in a class for behaviorally disordered\n\nboys.\n\n  I investigated.\n hit Rick with a baseball\n\nbat.\n A plastic bat.\n My disgust with the Johnsons knew no bounds.\n I happen to know about plastic bats.\n My own kids, ages eight and five, use them as swords all the\n\ntime.\n\n  The \" drowning\" incident?\n Tommy had dunked Rick, I found out.\n I wish I had a nickel for every time, growing up, one of my five\n\nbrothers tried to dunk me, or I one of them.\n\n\n  Was Tommy psychotic?\n Every psychiatrist and psychologist who saw him affirmed that he was\n\na healthy child, not emotionally disturbed.\n His presence in a special education class?\n \" He didn't belong here,\" the special- education school social worker\n\ntold me flatly.\n It was only pressure from Mrs.\n Johnson that put Tommy in the class.\n In fact, soon after he was placed at the orphanage, Tommy was back at\n\na regular school--\"a delightful and regular boy,\" according to the director\n\nof Hephzibah.\n\n  As his lawyer, I got to know Tommy well.\n I took him to a Wendy 's.\n We went for walks.\n We talked about life with his family.\n\n\n \n\n  \" Because my brother 's there.\n If I had been a better boy, if I had listened to my parents, I\n\nwouldn't be in this fix.\"\n\n  I tried to reassure him that all little boys sometimes don't\n\nlisten to their mothers and fathers.\n He would have none of it.\n All little boys, he pointed out, weren't turned in to orphanages.\n All little boys hadn't been abandoned by two sets of parents by the\n\ntime they were eleven years old.\n\n  My heart broke for him.\n I told him he was wrong--he was, and is, a good kid.\n\n\n  A couple of weeks later I took him swimming with my two boys.\n On another occasion he stayed with us for the weekend.\n My kids love him.\n\n\n  As outraged as I am about what happened to Tommy, I know that\n\nhis situation is not unique.\n The sad fact is that more and more adoptive families are turning\n\ntheir kids back in.\n According to the Child Welfare League of America, some 13 percent of\n\nall adopted children were returned to state officials in 1989.\n Among children who are older, or who have physical or emotional\n\nproblems, the percentage runs closer to 25 percent.\n\n  Just in the last couple of months, in my bailiwick, two\n\nmiddle-class families turned in their kids at juvenile court.\n In one case, the parents, a physician and his wife, fought over the\n\ncar, the house, and the record collection when they divorced.\n But when it came to their adopted child, they simply dropped him off\n\nat the juvenile court and walked away.\n In the second case, the kid was close to his adoptive father--who\n\ndied.\n\n\n  But let 's not just point the finger at adoptive parents.\n I also know firsthand that natural parents are not exempt.\n I can't tell you the number of middle-class couples I 've seen in my\n\nprofessional capacity who keep their kids, but emotionally walk away from\n\nthem.\n Careers take precedence.\n Both parents work late.\n After-work business drinks or dinners are more important than\n\nfamily.\n And the kids? Well, they 've got to learn to be independent someday,\n\ndon't they?\n\n  I don't mean to imply that every parent or even most, are bad.\n There are wonderful parents out there.\n And some of them adopt kids--and love them and commit to them and\n\nstand by them for life.\n\n\n  There was some good news for him: We won our case.\n The judge reversed himself and ordered the Johnsons to provide Tommy\n\nand Rick with weekly visits and nightly phone calls under the supervision of\n\nHephzibah.\n So Tommy and Rick do see each other, and both are better off because\n\nof it.\n The court also ordered the responsible state agency to find a new\n\nadoptive home for Tommy.\n\n  One day after the battle for visitation with Rick was all over,\n\nI took Tommy for a power lunch at McDonalds.\n Afterward we went for a walk.\n He wanted to climb a tree and I boosted him up.\n Later, I asked him the question that had by this time become a\n\nroutine for us: \" Now, what do lawyers do for their clients?\"\n\n  Tommy always pretended that he didn't know what lawyers do.\n On this occasion, though, he looked at me, his eyes dancing with\n\nmischief, and replied, \" Ah, of course I know.\n They buy them cheeseburgers, fries, and a chocolate shake, and climb\n\ntrees with clients.\"\n\n  In his humor, Tommy probably told me more about what I like\n\nabout being a lawyer than I had inferred in the quarter-century I 've been\n\npracticing.\n\n\n  There is more, of course, I could not expect a child who was\n\ncruelly abandoned not once but twice to escape unharmed.\n So later I was sad, but not surprised, to learn that Tommy began\n\nhaving emotional problems.\n\n  He is receiving help from them, though, and I hope--and\n\nBelieve--he will make it.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2969ed9a-38fe-421b-8ce4-ae5a87e856ad", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.907895+00:00"}
{"text": "In 1945, the Eugenics Society of Northern California--the\n\nmouthpiece of prominent banker Charles Matthias Goethe--published a pamphlet\n\nthat examined the culture of Java.\n Although he was primarily concerned with the eugenic health of the\n\nUnited States, Goethe insisted that there was much to be gained from a\n\ntransnational perspective: \" The eugenist studies these Backward Peoples.\n [ \u00c9] Thus, in the steaming orchid-hung tropics, we will try to unravel\n\nthe twisted skein of population problems, common to Malay and Eskimo, to\n\nHottentot, Lapp, and Berber.\" My project will examine Goethe 's transnational\n\nview of eugenic theory and application, which he extended from Java to Egypt,\n\nChina, Peru, and Nazi Germany.\n I will use his Eugenics Pamphlets as a key source.\n These pamphlets, published between 1930 and 1950 provide particularly\n\nrich insights into the heyday of forced sterilization and positive eugenics.\n Although eugenics is usually associated with domestic anxiety about\n\nimmigration, minorities, and the decline of white fertility, I propose that\n\neugenicist propaganda framed this anxiety in a larger structure of fear and\n\nfascination towards Goethe 's so-called \" Backward Peoples.\" By analyzing the\n\nmanner in which Goethe 's eugenic imagination addressed issues of culture,\n\nscience, and reproduction outside the United States, I intend to illuminate\n\nthe international perspective of American eugenics in the early twentieth\n\ncentury.\n\n  The bulk of the historiography of American eugenics provides a\n\npowerful narrative of growth that traces the development of eugenics from its\n\ntheoretical foundations in England to its most thorough institutionalization\n\nin Western Europe and the United States.\n It tends to emphasize the domestic concerns of eugenicists while\n\nminimizing the interest they bore towards other countries and peoples, and \"\n\nexotic\" ones in particular.\n Daniel J. Kevles' In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of\n\nHuman Heredity ( 1985) serves as the standard for the history of eugenics in\n\nthe United States and Britain.\n He discusses the establishment of eugenic ideas by English thinkers\n\nlike Francis Galton, and the implementation of eugenic policies in the United\n\nStates.\n Kevles, of course, sets a strictly British/American stage for eugenic\n\nthought.\n\n  Scholars following Kevles greatly expanded the study of eugenics\n\nin the United States, but still emphasized the domestic worries of\n\neugenicists over their formulations of the non-American \" other.\" In an\n\nattempt to escape this British/American tradition, some historians began to\n\nexamine eugenics in other countries.\n In 1994, Stefan Kxhl published The Nazi Connection: Eugenics,\n\nAmerican Racism, and German National Socialism, which connected Nazi race\n\nhygienists to American eugenicists.\n Studies which sought to offer comparative perspectives on\n\neugenics--such as Mark B. Adams' The Wellborn Science: Eugenics in Germany,\n\nFrance, Brazil, and Russia ( 1990)--compared and contrasted the development\n\nand implementation of eugenic ideology, but did not emphasize its\n\ninternational scope or recognize the powerful influence of an international\n\ncommunity of eugenicists.\n\n  In the past decade, historians of American eugenics turned to\n\ndiscussing how eugenics affected American women and minorities, especially in\n\nthe context of nonconsensual sterilization programs that targeted\n\nAfrican-Americans and Native Americans.\n Most visible were attempts to enlarge Kevles' preliminary discussion\n\nof how eugenics linked to ideas of womanhood.\n In Building a Better Race: Gender, Sexuality, and Eugenics from the\n\nTurn of the Century to the Baby Boom ( 2001), Wendy Kline recognizes the\n\nclose links forged by eugenic thought to concepts of ideal sexual roles for\n\nwomen in particular. \n\n  The most recent scholarship addresses how eugenic ideas worked\n\ninto the mainstream consciousness of American life.\n Again, this work provides powerful insights into eugenics and\n\ndomestic life, but offers little about how eugenics pictured cultures/races\n\noutside of the United States.\n Popular Eugenics: National Efficiency and American Mass Culture in\n\nthe 1930s ( 2006) is a collection of essays that analyze how eugenics\n\nmanifested in American literature, fashion, comic strips, and film.\n Another recent work is Alexandra Minna Stern 's Eugenic Nation: Faults\n\nand Frontiers of Better Breeding in Modern America ( 2005).\n It focuses primarily on California as a pulse point for the\n\nimplementation of eugenic institutions such as forced sterilization, but also\n\nconsiders how eugenic ideas touched on such institutions as school\n\nsegregation, the Border Patrol, and environmental conservation. \n\n  While all of these works have contributed to an understanding of\n\neugenics as chiefly an obsession of American/British scientists and\n\ngovernments about the racial makeup of their populations, they neglect the\n\ndistorting mirrors held up by eugenicists like Goethe to other cultures.\n Although scholars have noted the connections between eugenics and\n\npublic exhibits about non-American cultures--for example, the displays of\n\nNative American and African life at the 1933 World 's Fair ( 1)--the\n\npossibilities for exploring eugenics' relationship to American imperialism\n\nare far from exhausted.\n My work will be a departure from other studies of eugenics in its\n\nclose attention to the manner in which these cultures are represented.\n\n  I have chosen to focus on Charles Goethe because he remains a\n\ndeeply controversial figure due to his philanthropy as well as his fierce\n\ndevotion to eugenics.\n He also corresponded regularly with eugenicists from Britain and\n\nGermany, demonstrating the transnational nature of the field of eugenics in\n\nthe most basic relationships between its proponents.\n Goethe was a founder of the Human Betterment Foundation, which also\n\nincluded biologist Paul Popenoe, Nobel winner Robert Millikan, and Stanford\n\nchancellor David Starr Jordan.\n A proud son of German immigrants, Goethe would follow the rise and\n\nfall of the Nazis carefully, and did not hesitate to praise the regime in its\n\nearly years for its racial policies.\n His position as a successful banker--his estate was valued at\n\n&dollar;24 million in 1966--gave him considerable influence in bankrolling eugenic\n\npublications. \n\n  Most importantly, Goethe was an avid traveler; from the accounts\n\nsupplied in his autobiography, Seeking to Serve, he gathered most of the\n\nmaterial presented in his pamphlets from his trips to Palestine, Cuba, \"\n\nGrand Leban,\" Syria, Mexico, Guatemala, Russia, South Africa, and many other\n\ncountries. ( 2)\n He wove travel anecdotes and photographs into morality tales about\n\neugenics for his publications.\n Goethe also highlighted his extensive travels in his\n\nautobiography.\n\n  Primarily, however, I will use his Eugenics Pamphlets to explore\n\nthe international cast of Goethe 's eugenics.\n They were produced for a wide audience; each pamphlet contains a\n\nfootnote that offers pamphlets free of charge for classroom use.\n The style of his writing is also remarkably akin to a brief\n\ntravelogue, complete with photographs ( Fig. 1, 3).\n The purpose of these narratives, however, is clear: to promote\n\neugenic ideas by examining the \" naturally\" occurring trends in \" primitive\"\n\npopulations--overpopulation, disease, or infertility among the ruling groups.\n However, the manner in which Goethe presents each people differs, and\n\nI hope to scrutinize these differences in order to clarify how each people\n\nfits into the American eugenicist 's schema of racial order. \n\n  In addition to the standard historiography of eugenics, I have\n\nreconstructed some of the early internationalisms among eugenicists of the\n\nearly twentieth century, in order to demonstrate that Goethe 's interest in\n\nnon-Anglo-American peoples aligned perfectly with the direction of eugenic\n\ninquiry among a surprisingly diverse group of scientists.\n Moreover, Goethe 's fascination with these peoples dovetailed with the\n\nhodgepodge of anthropology, statistics, and crude genetics that composed the\n\nfoundation of eugenics.\n I identify Goethe--active in publication primarily from 1930\n\nonwards--as a faithful descendant of early eugenicists such as Francis\n\nGalton, who relied on his travel in \" exotic\" locales to spur his thinking\n\nabout populations.\n As a member of the Royal Geographical Society, Galton was well known\n\nfor his international exploits: he lived in the Middle East in the mid 1840s\n\nand created some of the first maps of sub-Saharan Africa. ( 3)\n These experiences, coupled with his cousin Charles Darwin 's Origin of\n\nSpecies, led him to formulate the term eugenics; in Better for All the World,\n\nHarry Bruinius noted: \" While abroad, he had long been fascinated by the\n\nphysical and mental \u00d4peculiarities\u00d5 of peoples like the Hottentots.\" ( 4)\n\n\n\n  From 1900-1939, the international eugenics community enriched\n\nGalton 's legacy by relying on vaguely scientific/anthropological accounts of \"\n\nBackward Peoples\" to create the first substantial pools of academic eugenics\n\nknowledge.\n At the International Eugenics Congresses of 1912, 1921, and 1932,\n\nscientists from the United States, Britain, and other European countries\n\npresented papers on a wide range of eugenics issues.\n At the 1912 conference, a paper from the University of Naples, for\n\nexample, considered mulattos from Louisiana and \" polyhybrids\" from the\n\nPhilippines. ( 5)\n The international nature possessed by these proponents of eugenics is\n\nimportant to recognize because Goethe attended such conferences and drew upon\n\nthe global scope of inquiry espoused by the attendees.\n Notably, Goethe and his wife were delegates to the Hague\n\nInternational Eugenic Conference in 1936, and reacted in shock to the\n\nexecution of a Russian eugenicist friend, Nikolai Vavilov, in 1937. ( 6)\n\n  The bulk of my primary source research is complete, and my next\n\ntask is to construct a theoretical framework for understanding Goethe 's\n\nparticular brand of eugenics.\n My tentative conception of Goethe 's internationalism is to see it as\n\nparalleling some of the strategies of classical anthropology.\n As such, Goethe 's characterizations of peoples in the Middle East,\n\nAsia, and South America follows classical anthropology 's \" schizogenic use of\n\nTime\" ( 7); specifically, Goethe described his subjects as existing at an\n\nearlier stage of human development.\n For example, scattered through his pamphlets, Goethe inserted images\n\nof laborers or porters and captioned these photographs with a description of\n\nprimitive, inefficient labor techniques.\n He followed this sketch with a declaration of superior American\n\ningenuity in inventing weight-bearing machines, and usually concluded with an\n\nalarming statement about American \" race-suicide.\" ( 8) \n\n  Potentially, I see Goethe 's pamphlets as fulfilling a mission of\n\npopular anthropology, which bears a tendency towards exoticizing subject\n\npeoples and affirming the superiority of the Western reader.\n It is important to consider that Goethe offered these pamphlets free\n\nof charge, and especially encouraged teachers to utilize them.\n What kind of cultural work does popular anthropology do?\n In Reading National Geographic, Catherine A. Lutz and Jane L. Collins\n\nhighlight the questions surrounding a similar publication that presents\n\nnon-Western peoples to Western readers:\n\n  It is not about how \" realistic\" Western images of that world are\n\nbut about the imaginative spaces that non-Western peoples occupy and the\n\ntropes and stories that organize their existence in Western minds.\n The question then becomes, how do these images purveyed by National\n\nGeographic affect this space?\n Do they congeal popular paradigms of evolutionary ascendancy?\n Do they emphasize contrastive work and evaluation?\n Or do they compel empathy and identification?\n Do they in some cases do both, drawing attention with an exotic\n\nelement, and then--having captured their readers' attention--inviting them to\n\nimagine how they might feel in the setting depicted? ( 9)\n\n  Of course, a vital difference between National Geographic and\n\nEugenic Pamphlets lies in the fact that Goethe crafted each article or \"\n\neugenigram\" to convince the reader that at least in America, sexual\n\nreproduction demanded interference in the form of positive and negative\n\neugenics.\n For example, Goethe inserted supposedly Chinese proverbs--complete\n\nwith awkwardly drawn Chinese characters ( Fig. 2)--into many of his\n\npamphlets.\n These proverbs provided a bit of intellectual exotica in service of\n\nsupposedly universal eugenic principles.\n Goethe was not interested in the preservation of any culture, but\n\nrather actively desired the transformation of his own.\n He did not seek only to entertain or titillate, but to provoke\n\nindignation and socio-political action through the rhetoric of eugenic\n\nimaginings.\n\n  Discussion of Nazi eugenics is well established among historians\n\nof science, as is the development of American eugenics; however, eugenics is\n\nusually understood to be associated mainly with internal concerns about the\n\nnation.\n Quite plainly, however, Goethe bridged the gap between domestic\n\nworries and his international hierarchy of nations and peoples.\n Accordingly, most scholarship has not exposed eugenics as an idea\n\nwith international ramifications.\n Understanding the transnational background of American\n\nconceptualizations of eugenic principles outside of a domestic, American\n\nenvironment will allow eugenics to fit into broader issues of imperialism and\n\ncolonialism.\n By examining Goethe 's use of non-Anglo-American cultures, I hope to\n\nprovide a unique perspective on eugenics' deeply problematic fantasies about \"\n\nBackward Peoples.\"", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "52fa4ba3-5b96-414e-a81a-54fd0793dc13", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.909295+00:00"}
{"text": "There is a lack of information on the environmental fate of\n\nherbicides used for silvicultural purposes in the Lake states region.\n Water quality is an important issue, and pesticides are a major focal\n\npoint of public concern.\n Pesticide persistence and mobility in the soil are key factors in\n\nwater-quality issues.\n Knowledge of herbicide half-lives and leaching characteristics in\n\nforested environments is limited primarily to data from southern or western\n\nstates; little research has been done in the Lake states or the Northeast [\n\n1].\n The objective of this study was to determine the environmental fate of\n\nthree soil-active herbicides - - hexazinone, sulfometuron methyl, and\n\ntebuthiuron ( Velpar L?, Oust? ( E.I. du Pont de Nemours Inc., Wilmington,\n\nDE), and Spike? ( DowElanco Inc., Indianapolis, IN))-- in low base saturated\n\nsand soils that had been preconditioned by treatment with acidified rainwater\n\nfor four years. \n\n  The behavior of a chemical in the soil is determined by properties\n\nof both the chemical and the soil environment [ 2].\n Important properties of herbicides are water solubility, soil\n\nadsorption, chemical and photodegradation, microbial breakdown, and\n\nvolatility [ 3].\n Primary environmental conditions include precipitation amount and\n\ndistribution, temperature, soil type, organic matter content, and pH.\n Large areas of low base saturated sand soils in the Lake states\n\nregion are subject to acidification by atmospheric deposition [ 4].\n Interactions among atmospheric deposition, soil acidity, organic\n\nmatter content, the environmental fate of herbicides, and their potential\n\neffects on water quality have not been investigated.\n We hypothesized that the combination of coarse soil texture, low base\n\nsaturation, low organic matter content, and preconditioning would represent\n\nworst-case conditions likely to be encountered in the upper Lake states\n\nregion.\n This paper reports effects of litter-humus treatments, amount of\n\napplied precipitation, soil characteristics, and rainwater acidity on\n\nbehavior of the three herbicides. \n\n\n\n  Lysimeters were used to determine the mobility and dissipation of\n\nthe soil-active herbicides hexazinone [\n\n3-cyclohexyl-6-(dimethylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4(1 H  ,\n\n3 H  ) - dione]; sulfometuron methyl ( methyl 2- [ [ [ [ (\n\n4,6-dimethyl-2- pyrimidinyl)amino]-carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]benzoate); and\n\ntebuthiuron (  N  - [ 5- (\n\n1,1-dimethylethyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl]- N  ,  N  ' -\n\ndimethylurea) in acid sandy soils.\n 14C-labeled hexazinone, sulfometuron methyl, and tebuthiuron were\n\nused to spike the commercial formulation of each product.\n The specific activities of [ 14C]carbonyl hexazinone, [ 14C]phenyl\n\nsulfometuron methyl, and [ 14C]5- thiadiazole-ring tebuthiuron were 263.1,\n\n218.3, and 429.2 kBq/mg, respectively.  \n\n\n  Detailed soil and site characteristics and lysimeter methodology\n\nwere reported previously [ 4].\n Briefly, intact soil columns were collected in 15- x 150-cm polyvinyl\n\nchloride ( PVC) pipes from six sites on national forest in northeastern\n\nMinnesota, northern Wisconsin, and Upper Michigan in October 1984.\n The sites were selected to provide soils with either 0 to 10 or 10 to\n\n20% base saturation.\n The soil columns were transported to the Forestry Sciences Laboratory\n\nat Grand Rapids, Minnesota ( 47?20'N, 93?30'W).\n Lysimeters were constructed by sealing the base of each with a\n\nwatertight PVC cap and instrumenting it with 70-  ?  m\n\nporous polyethylene filters to sample soil water at the 10-,20-,40-, and 150-\n\ncm levels.\n The completed columns were installed at the original soil depth to\n\nmaintain normal soil temperatures and atmospheric conditions.\n They were covered with Fiberglass shelters at night and during\n\nrainstorms to exclude dust and ambient rainfall. \n\n\n  To minimize variation in forest floor thickness among soil\n\ncolumns, the litter- humus layer was removed from each and replaced with a\n\ncap prepared from 400 g of coarsely ground litter-humus from a jack pine or\n\nmixed hardwood stand or with an equal weight of quartz sand.\n L.) was established\n\non each to stabilize the cap and to provide an active root system.\n Rainwater was collected from a greenhouse roof, stored at 3 to 52C in\n\na polyethylene tank, and acidified to pH 5.4 or 4.2 with a 1:1 solution of\n\nHNO3 + H2SO4.\n Half of the soil columns received rainwater acidified to pH 5.4, and\n\nthe other half received rainwater at pH 4.2.\n Applications were made weekly throughout the growing season, and the\n\nleachate was collected periodically.\n During the four-year preconditioning period, a total of 4,600 mm of\n\nwater was applied. \n\n\n  The study was conducted using a randomized complete block design\n\nwith four herbicide treatments, including an untreated control, applied to\n\nsoils from each of the six sites, with six replications.\n Thus, each herbicide treatment was applied to 36 soil columns, for a\n\ntotal of 144 lysimeters.\n The herbicides were applied to the surface of the soils on July 28,\n\n1989; application rates of active ingredient ( a.i.) were 2.24kg/ha of\n\nhexazinone ( 47.9kBq 14C per lysimeter), 42.5 g/ha of sulfometuron methyl (\n\n47.0 kBq 14C per lysimeter), and 2.24 kg/ha of tebuthiuron ( 93.4 kBq 14C per\n\nlysimeter).\n On the following day, 10 ml of 1.0 M NaCl solution was applied to\n\neach column as a conservative ion tracer to indicate the Cl- breakthrough\n\nvolume.\n Acidified rainwater was applied to the columns once weekly at rates\n\nto approximate the actual precipitation recorded at an adjacent official\n\nweather station.\n The amount of water applied substantially exceeded actual\n\nprecipitation on three treatment dates, both to enable collection of\n\nsufficient sample volume at the upper soil levels and to simulate rainfall\n\nrepresentative of worst-case conditions.\n Soil water was collected once at the 10-, 20-, and 40-cm levels and\n\n10 times at the 150-cm level over the 130 of post-treatment.\n At each sample date, all leachate was collected and weighed;\n\nsubsamples were subsequently analyzed for herbicides and 24 chemical\n\nparameters.\n Samples were stored at 3 to 52C until all analyses were completed.\n\n \n\n\n  Concentrations of Cl- in leachate were measured with an ion\n\nchromatograph ( Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA).\n 14C was determined in a 3.0-ml subsample by liquid scintillation\n\ncounting techniques with correction for quenching and background.\n Count rates were converted to concentration of chemical in solution.\n The 14C was confirmed to be parent compound by HPLC analyses using a\n\nHewlett Packard ( Avondale, PA) model HP 1090 with a Radiomatic flow detector\n\n( Radiomatic Instruments, Meriden, CT) with C8 and C18 columns and different\n\nsolvent systems and comparing retention times of samples to standards.\n The 14C was predominantly parent compounds with trace amounts of\n\nunidentified metabolites.\n Losses due to plant uptake and degradation were not considered.\n The recovered 14C was analyzed by concentration ( micrograms per\n\nliter) and total amount ( percentage of a.i. applied).\n Data were evaluated by analysis of variance ( ANOVA) with leachate\n\nvolume as a covariate.\n Treatment differences were tested with the least significant\n\ndifference ( LSD) procedure [ 5]. \n\n\n  Ambient precipitation for the 60-d post-treatment period was 254\n\nmm, 96 mm above the 50-year mean [ 6].\n Elevated Cl- concentrations appeared in leachate collected at the\n\n150-cm level 45 d post-treatment, after 154 mm of rainwater had been applied\n\n( Table 1), indicating displacement of the initial soil solution from the\n\nlysimeters.\n Thus, the 440 mm of water applied during the 130-d study period was\n\napproximately three times the mean pore volume of the soils and double the\n\n50-year average precipitation for this area.  \n\n  Rainwater pH had no significant effect on herbicide movement,\n\napparently due to high soil acidity.\n In 1984, before the acid rain treatments began, pH of the surface 40\n\ncm of soil ( in 0.02 M CaCl2) from four of the six sites averaged 4.3 [ 4];\n\ncurrent acidity has not been determined. \n\n  Leaching of the three herbicides differed significantly by\n\nlitter-humus treatment, quantity of applied rainwater, and soil\n\ncharacteristics.\n The variation in mobility reflects differences in their physical and\n\nchemical properties.\n Sulfometuron methyl has a short half-life and is not readily soluble,\n\nparticularly under acidic conditions [ 7,8].\n From 80 to 130 d post-treatment, no sulfometuron methyl was detected\n\nbelow the 20-cm level ( Table 2), and none was found in leachate at 150 cm at\n\nany sample date.\n By 80 d post-treatment, the 14C activity was near background level,\n\nsuggesting that most of the compound had been degrade [ 8] or irreversibly\n\nsorbed into the upper soil layers.  \n\n  Concentrations of hexazinone and tebuthiuron at 10 and 20 cm\n\nwere, respectively, nearly two and fivefold greater than those at 150 cm,\n\nindicating that most of the products remain in the upper portion of the\n\nprofiles after the first growing season.\n Tebuthiuron is about 10 times as soluble as sulfometuron, as\n\nreflected by the higher concentrations at the 10- and 20-cm levels and its\n\npresence lower in the profiles.\n It was detected in leachate at the 150-cm level from 12 of the 36\n\ntreated soil columns.\n Hexazinone is highly soluble and is subject to both lateral and\n\nvertical movement under conditions conducive to leaching [ 9].\n Under the conditions of this study, hexazinone reached the 150- cm\n\nlevel in 31 of the 36 lysimeters.\n Measurable concentrations of hexazinone first appeared in leachate at\n\n150 cm from seven of the 36 columns 52 d post- treatment ( Table 3).\n Tebuthiuron was first detected in leachate from two lysimeters 66 d\n\npost-treatment after 286 mm of water had been applied.\n The highest concentrations of both hexazinone and tebuthiuron\n\noccurred 80 d post- treatment ( Table 3), following application of 44 mm of\n\nwater over the previous two-week period, the smallest application since\n\ndisplacement of the pore volume ( Table 1).\n These results agree with both field plot and watershed studies.\n In a field study in Alberta, Canada, Feng et al. [ 10] found an\n\ninverse relation between hexazinone concentrations and leachate volume.\n In catchment-scale studies, very large storms generally do not result\n\nin high chemical concentrations due to dilution by large flow volumes; the\n\nintermediate storms frequently produce the higher concentrations [ 11]. \n\n\n\n  The amounts of both hexazinone and tebuthiouron reaching the\n\n150-cm level varied significantly by collection date, due to amount of\n\napplied rainwater.\n The above average ambient precipitation following herbicide\n\napplication and consequent heavy rainwater applications undoubtedly\n\ncontributed to the quantity of materials reaching the 150-cm level [ 12].\n Bowman [ 13] documented greater mobility and leaching of two triazine\n\nherbicides in soil cores that received supplemental watering, compared to\n\nthose that received natural rainfall.\n The relation between leachate volume and the percentage of each\n\nproduct recovered at the 150-cm level was highly significant (  p \n\n<0.01,  r  =0.71 for hexazinone and  r  =0.44 for\n\ntebuthiuron).The higher coefficient for hexazinone reflects its greater\n\nsolubility Beckie and McKercher [ 14] found a close relation between the\n\nposition of the wetting front in soil columns and movement of two\n\nsulfonylurea herbicides, suggesting a high leaching potential in coarse\n\ntextured soils.\n The greatest amount of both products at the 150-cm level occurred 101\n\nd post-treatment ( Table 3), following application of 88 mm of water, the\n\nlargest treatment of the year ( Table 10).\n This treatment amount is nearly equivalent to a 25-h rainfall of 3.5\n\nin. ( 8.9 cm); the probability of a storm of this magnitude at this site is\n\none in 10 years [ 15].  \n\n  Leaching of both hexazinone and tebuthiuron differed\n\nsubstantially by site ( Table 4).\n Movement of tebuthiuron is determined largely by soil properties.\n It is strongly adsorbed by organic matter and clay particles [\n\n16,17], resulting in large differences among sites in both concentration and\n\namount of recovered chemical.\n No tebuthiuron reached 150-cm level in soils from sites 2 or 3, where\n\npH of the surface 40 cm of soil was 4.7 and base saturation averaged 22%.\n Small amounts were recovered from the four more acidic sites, where\n\npH averaged 4.3 and mean base saturation was <6%. \n The soils of sites 2 and 3 were classified as Aquic Udipsamments; the\n\nother four sites were either Entic Haplorthods, Typic Udipsamments, or Spodic\n\nUdipsamments [ 4].\n These data suggest that soil pH and base saturation of the upper\n\nhorizons, in conjunction with soil classification, may be of value in\n\nidentifying sites where tebuthiuron is likely to leach below the rooting\n\nzone.\n On these same sites, soil properties had far less influence on\n\nmovement of hexazinone.\n Despite the twofold difference in both concentration and percentage\n\nof hexazinone among the six sites, the differences were not significant (\n\n p  >0.05). \n\n  The litter-humus treatments had a most pronounced effect on\n\nleaching of both hexazinone and tebuthiuron ( Table 5).\n Humus type ( hardwood pine) did not significantly affect movement of\n\nhexazinone; however, hardwood humus was particularly effective in retaining\n\ntebuthiuron in the upper portion of the profiles.\n The lack of a litter-humus cover increased the amount of hexazinone\n\nreaching the 150-cm level by nearly threefold and that of tebuthiuron by\n\nnearly fivefold.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9f334ff2-ed7e-4b2f-a5f7-85d82683c5c6", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.910737+00:00"}
{"text": "Twenty-six years ago this week, Walt Disney Co., masquerading as\n\nthe Latin- American Development and Management Corp., started buying\n\nthousands of acres of cattle pasture and swamp in Osceola County.\n\n  Today, Disney is on the verge of building a posh community on\n\n4,000 of those acres that will change Osceola County forever.\n\n  \" It 's an important day for Osceola County and our company,\"\n\nDisney Development Vice President Tom Lewis said.\n\n  Lewis would not discuss the plans in detail before the\n\npresentation.\n\n  But more than a dozen elected officials, planners and\n\nbusiness-community leaders who have been in private briefings in the past\n\nthree weeks said Disney is aiming to create a modern city of as many as\n\n20,000 residents.\n\n  Many of those people declined to be identified because of their\n\nrelationship with Disney or because they did not want to speak publicly about\n\nthe plans before today 's meeting.\n\n  They said those plans call for the largest shopping mall in\n\nCentral Florida, office buildings and 8,400 residences, including 3,450\n\nhigh-priced, single-family homes.\n\n  The plans also include golf courses, an 800-room hotel, a\n\ntransportation station, a hospital, schools and institutes celebrating \" the\n\npioneering ingenuity of free enterprise,\" the officials and community leaders\n\nsaid.\n\n  Plenty has changed from the original concept announced amid much\n\nfanfare in March 1990.\n Disney has reduced the size of the office parks and increased the\n\nnumber of homes.\n\n  Lewis said Disney 's first foray into the regional planning\n\nprocess is taking longer than he anticipated.\n But he said the delays aren't abnormal for a project of that scope.\n \" We're not talking about puttin 'rep one 200,000- square-foot office\n\nbuilding or a 300-room Holiday Inn here,\" Lewis said.\n\n  Disney would like to begin building the first phase of the\n\nproject, a 200,000-square-foot office building, later this year. The\n\nbuilding, which is being designed by renowned Italian architect Aldo Rossi,\n\nwould be Osceola County 's second-largest structure.\n\n\n  And that 's just an appetizer.\n Seven and a half of those office buildings would fit inside the big\n\nproject, a regional shopping mall.\n\n  The current timetable calls for the mall 's completion in late\n\n1993 or early 1994, Todd Mansfield of Disney Development Co.said.\n\n  Building the mall won't be a problem, Mansfield said; finding\n\nfinancially healthy anchor tenants will.\n \" With the retail center, the timetable is not entirely in Disney 's\n\ncourt,\" Mansfield said. \" It is a tough time in the retail market.\n But we are quite optimistic that this is an unusually attractive\n\nretailing opportunity.\"\n\n \n\n  Dan Barry, a retail analyst with the New York brokerage firm of\n\nKidder Peabody, said that despite upheaval in the retailing industry, several\n\nchains have strong balance sheets and could anchor the mall.\n\n  More than a year ago, Disney officials said they were talking\n\nwith retail blue bloods such as Nordstrom Inc.\n of Seattle, Harrod 's of London and Macy of New York.\n A Disney source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed\n\nthat talks with all three retailers are progressing.\n\n  All would be logical choices for Disney, especially Nordstrom,\n\nBarry said.\n\n  The Seattle retailer \" is one of the few companies that 's\n\nnationally known,\" Barry said, and, though many of its stores are on the West\n\nCoast, \" they wouldn't have a problem expanding into Florida.\"\n\n  Mansfield said he also is talking with stores \" prominent in the\n\nFlorida market\" and chains based in France and Japan.\n\n  The moderate-to-upscale anchor stores fit right in with the\n\ncompany 's plans for high-priced, golf-course, estate homes.\n\n  \" They mentioned housing with a Key West theme,\" said Cliff\n\nGuillet, executive director of the East Central Florida Regional Planning\n\nCouncil, who saw the plans two weeks ago.\n\n  Sources said Disney has no provisions for more affordable housing\n\non the Osceola property.\n\n\n  Osceola County officials said talks with Disney include the\n\ncompany making a \" substantive, seven-figure\" contribution to create a\n\nrevolving, affordable loan fund for low-income and first-time home\n\nbuyers.\n\n  \" The economics of putting affordable housing out there on some\n\nof the most valuable land around doesn't make a lot of sense,\" one Osceola\n\nCounty official said.\n \" But that doesn't mean they shouldn't have an obligation to help\n\nbuild it somewhere else.\"\n\n  Today 's presentation will mark several \" firsts\" in the\n\nDisney-Osceola County relationship.\n\n  Any construction will be the first in Osceola County; all of its\n\ntheme parks and hotels are in Orange County.\n The project marks the first time Disney has agreed to follow the same\n\nrules as other developers.\n Disney plans have been exempt from *local* review since 1967, when\n\nthe state created the autonomous Reedy Creek Improvement District.\n\n  Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the presentation is why it 's\n\nhappening at all.\n\n  The unveiling is being made at Osceola County commissioners'\n\nrequest to help dampen some opposition to the proposed 11-mile western\n\nextension of Dart Boulevard in northern Osceola County.\n\n  Critics of the extension, including business owners on West U.S.\n\n192, want some assurances that the county won't be building a direct route to\n\nDisney World that could bypass many businesses.\n\n  Other critics, including some county officials, also believe\n\nDisney should pay more toward the public-private partnership proposed to\n\nfinance the\n\n&dollar;97 million toll road from Florida 's Turnpike to World Drive.\n\n  Les Haskew, executive director of the Kissimmee/Osceola County\n\nChamber of Commerce, said his group hasn't taken an official position on the\n\nDart extension yet.\n\n  \" We are very concerned about ( U.S.) 192,\" Haskew said.\n \" And we're very concerned 'reat this isn't going to create a straight\n\nshot to Disney World and then they don't build anything to expand our tax\n\nbase in Osceola.\"\n\n  Slated to open in conjunction with the Orlando beltway 's Southern\n\nConnector extension in 1994, Dart is an integral piece of the Disney road\n\nnetwork.\n\n  Because the Dart deal is vital to Disney 's expansion plans for\n\nthe next 30 years, Lewis said he is ready to put the Osceola County project\n\non the table now.\n\n  Disney has agreed to contribute\n\n&dollar;1.5 million a year to the county for the 22-year life of the bonds that will\n\npay for the extension, plus have Reedy Creek underwrite the bond issue.\n\n  Commissioner Larry Whaley thinks Disney will get a lot more out\n\nof the Dart deal than the substantial amount it is already committed to put\n\ninto it.\n\n  \" They ( Disney) keep telling us about how much they're going to\n\n're up,\" Whaley said.\n \" But what they aren't saying is that a lot of that is going to be\n\nrepaid after the road turns a profit.\n They need to understand - and I'm sure they do un 'mrstand - what\n\nvalue they are going to get out of it, too.\"\n\n  Some longtime Osceola County residents doubt that Disney is ready\n\nto build.\n They say they won't believe it until they see shovels turning\n\ndirt.\n\n  Walt Disney 's original vision for a futuristic city called EPCOT\n\n- Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow - and a small airport were on\n\nthe company 's original maps where the mall is now to be built.\n In the early 1980s, as Epcot Center - the theme park - was nearing\n\ncompletion, the company announced plans for a hotel and shopping village in\n\nOsceola County just like the Disney Shopping Village at Lake Buena Vista in\n\nOrange County.\n\n\n  \" They've blown plen 'veof smoke before,\" Whaley said.\n \" I tend to believe it 's going to happen this time.\n\n\n  MEMO: Vicki Vaughan of the Sentinel staff contributed to this\n\nreport.\n\n  Disney Development Co.officials are to unveil plans to develop a\n\ncity of about 20,000 in Osceola County at 10 a.m. today before the Osceola\n\nCounty Commission. \n\n\n\n\n  Nobody wanted to see it turn out this way for the old man.\n\n\n  Orange County officials didn't think they'd have to p 'dce\n\n74-year-old Omer St.Pierre in handcuffs or take him to the mental health\n\ncrisis center.\n\n  They didn't think his elderly wife would develop chest pains and\n\nthey would have to call an ambulance.\n They didn't even know they would cost him nearly 30 percent of his\n\nyearly income.\n But rules are rules, and the old man didn't follow them.\n\n\n  Instead, the eccentric French Canadian kept collecting.\n In a deep hole beside his Orlo Vista home, he layered refrigerators,\n\nshopping carts, clothes, two car engines, books and heaven knows what else.\n\n\n  \" I pleaded with him to clean the property,\" said Benny Roberts,\n\nthe county 's chief code enforcement officer.\n\n  When he didn't, the county hired a contractor with a big scoop\n\nand a tractor-trailer to haul the stuff away.\n\n  \" It was just - just junk,\" said Hoke Dorough, code enforcement\n\nofficer.\n\n\n  It is hard to grasp the logic of an old man who carts home dozens\n\nof dead Christmas trees.\n What use are they? Why would he want such stuff?\n\n  The answer is that having the trees isn't the point.\n Collecting them is.\n\n\n  St. Pierre brings home bags of shoes, for instance, and sits\n\nplacidly sorting them on the porch of his cement block and tin roof house.\n\n\n  So he doesn't take it kindly when the county describes his things\n\nas junk.\n After all, no one likes to think his labor has been for naught.\n\n\n  Perhaps worn-out shoes look valuable when your income is less\n\nthan\n\n&dollar;4,500 a year.\n Maybe you want a small stock of refrigerators in case yours quits.\n Maybe the bags of clothes are a kind of imagined insurance against\n\npoverty.\n\n  St. Pierre 's next-door neighbor, A.J. Rowe, said St. Pierre gives\n\naway many of the things he collects.\n\n \n\n  St. Pierre was still hauling things by his neighbors' small block\n\nhouses and sparse yards - some of them also littered with trash - when one of\n\nthem complained.\n\n \n\n  \" What gripes me is that I was here and he was here before any\n\nother houses.\n He 's been doing this for 40-some years.\n\n\n  Code officer Dorough said he didn't even see the hole during his\n\nfirst visit in August until he walked up on it.\n\n  \" What I saw blew my mind.\n I told him he needs to clean up the property and stop bringing\n\nthings home that way,\" Dorough said.\n\n  \" He kept mentioning somebody with a truck who was going to take\n\nthings away - that 's the best I could understand him.\n\n\n \n\n  \" No.\n He understands.\n Sometimes I don't think he 's got all his oars in the water, but I\n\ncan communicate with the old man,\" Dorough said.\n\n  St. Pierre said someone from the county came out several times\n\nand talked to his wife, Elaine, while he was in Jacksonville having a hernia\n\noperation.\n\n  She told him she thought the county was going to take away their\n\nhouse and repeated the word \" lien\" a lot.\n\n  Then they got two letters about something called a public\n\nhearing.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  St. Pierre doesn't always understand the questions, and he often\n\ndoesn't want to answer when he does, so he didn't go.\n\n  The county 's code board took its vote: If Omer St.Pierre\n\nwouldn't clean up his property, then the county should hire someone to do it\n\nand bill him.\n If he didn't pay, the county would place a lien against his house\n\nand collect when it was sold.\n\n  Contractors rolled onto St. Pierre 's property on March 4,\n\nknocked over the shed containing his library, and scooped up the remains.\n\n  \" I have 600 French books.\n\n\n  He said they hauled away a brand-new 1960 Buick motor in a\n\ncrate, a riding lawn mower and a big pile of dirt he planned to use to level\n\nhis lot.\n\n  St. Pierre was beside himself.\n A report by the Orange County Sheriff 's Office says he stood on his\n\nporch at 6505 Chantry St. and cranked off a couple of rounds from his\n\nshotgun.\n\n\n  \" When blood leaks and you'v 'veot a hole in your head, that 's\n\nwhat counts,\" St. Pierre said.\n\n  Deputies wrote that they heard St.Pierre screaming gibberish\n\nfrom the porch of his residence.\n His tone was very angry, the report said, but \" The words were\n\nunintelligible.\n\n  The deputies surrounded the house.\n\n\n  St. Pierre said, \" Three, four police.\n We all talking nice.

- I promise myself an uninterrupted\n\nround as soon as I finish a painting.\n Or after I call my mother.\n Or I use it to delay the inevitable, as I am doing now.\n As soon as I win, I will look up from the worn cards, survey my\n\nshelves, try to find something edible. \n\n  The games are also keeping me from panicking over the naked\n\nsheets of thick paper, thirsty to soak up water and color.\n I haven't set brush to paper in two weeks.\n The last thing I painted that I was really happy with was about three\n\nweeks ago.\n It was a crow sitting on a streetlight.\n I was pleased with the way I managed to catch the highlights of his\n\nfeathers, with that kind of dusty shine crows have.\n And his one yellow eye, his head cocked.\n Last week I turned that painting to face the wall, because it had\n\nbegun to seem like he was staring at me accusingly. \n\n  I'm worried that my brain will d 'm up with my paint, if it hasn't\n\nalready.\n It 's also been two weeks since I've been to the groce 'vestore.\n The last two nights I have ordered out - - pizza last night, Chinese\n\nbefore that.\n I went to the liquor store today, though.\n On my way home from work I stopped and bought a bottle of scotch with\n\nthe last of my petty cash to celebrate today.\n Tony at the liquor store knows me.\n I've been buying stuff 'veere since I was seventeen.\n Two aces show up in a row: hearts and spades.\n Hearts in spades.\n I should have spades and spades of hearts.\n\n\n  The year I moved out I was seventeen.\n My parents split up when I was fourteen, and the day the divorce\n\npapers were signed I resolved to get out as soon as I could.\n It was the usual arrangement: I lived with my mom, spent weekends\n\nonce in a while at my dad 's place.\n\n\n  They're OK, my parent 're - they didn't beat me or anything.\n My dad even came to see the student art show my sophomore year.\n It 's just that the divorce was very messy and anyone could see that\n\nthey had more important things to deal with than me.\n\n\n  I was working one night a week stocking at a local comic book\n\nstore, and they needed part-time work at the main warehouse.\n So I worked there after school most of my junior year.\n They hired me full-time as soon as I got out for summer, and I never\n\nwent back to school.\n After a month I was making twice minimum wage, taking orders over the\n\nphone.\n I rented an apartment on the south side of City Park, a small place,\n\njust to get out.\n After my first six-month lease was up, I found this place.\n It 's much better than the last one, on the north side, closer to\n\nwork, with lots of windows.\n I could say to my friends that I had light to work with now.\n I told my mom I was barely making the rent payments, and with the two\n\nhundred dollars she gave me I bought a brown-and-red Ford Fiesta. \n\n  The first time I made love with Jason was in the back of that\n\ncar.\n But I'm not thinking about t 'mt now, as I lay the four and the five\n\nand the six of hearts on top of the pile.\n I sold it for parts three months ago and bought a Chevy Citation with\n\nan oil leak.\n I repaired the leak myself with duct tape.\n Besides, it wasn't making love.\n\n\n  The sun is setting.\n I can tell because the light is getting red.\n I can't see the sun when it sets - - the buildings of downtown Denver\n\nare in the way - - but I don't mind.\n Afternoon light is best to paint by, and the afternoons will be\n\nlonger soon, when daylight savings time starts. \n\n  My dad 's place, where I used to spend weekends, had great light.\n It 's in the mountains, and it 's very quiet and all that.\n I used to wish that they would let me live with him instead of my\n\nmom, but there would have been no way for me to get to school.\n So I had to spend weeks at my mom 's place, with her and Dave.\n Dave always tried to be nice to me, but his idea of being nice was\n\noffering me a beer.\n I hate beer, and they drink too much.\n Besides, I didn't care if he was nice to me.\n I just wanted him to leave me alone, so I could play solitaire and\n\nthink about what I would paint the next weekend at my dad 's.\n I had a deck of cards with cats on the backs that I used until I lost\n\nthe jack of diamonds.\n These days, cards take a couple of months to wear out between my\n\nfingers, but I keep a spare deck around just in case. \n\n  When I started drinking, I drank vodka, just like every high\n\nschool student.\n It 's cheap.\n But the first time I went into Tony 's liquor store, I knew if I tried\n\nto buy vodka, especially dressed the way I usually was, in jeans and tennis\n\nshoes, he'd kno 'dI was underage.\n So I put on a pair of costume glasses and styled my hair in a French\n\ntwist.\n\n\n  After Jason left for college I cut my hair.\n I read somewhere that a lot of women cut their hair after ending\n\nrelationships, but I didn't end it.\n He did.\n I cropped it short, not more than an inch long.\n I did it myself, standing in front of the bathroom mirror.\n I did a pretty good job of it, too, and I've gott 'vebetter, since I\n\nhave to trim it every month or so. \n\n  I wore heels to the liquor store, and a skirt and blouse.\n I asked the man, who turned out to be Tony, for his recommendations\n\non what wine to drink with grilled fish and rice.\n He asked me what kind of fish, and I said halibut because I knew it\n\nwas a fancy type of fish.\n He recommended a French dry white wine from Meursault-Blagny,\n\nwhatever that means.\n I only remember it because I saved the bottle.\n I put flowers in it once in a while.\n I thanked him, and bought it, and he didn't card me, so the fifteen\n\ndollars I spent on the wine was worth it.\n The next time I went into the store, I wore a short skirt and a\n\nblouse with three buttons open and bought some Grand Marnier.\n After that I knew I was safe.\n\n\n  When the jack and queen of spades show up in the right order, I\n\nknow I've won 'vee game.\n But I play to the end as I always do, and then slide the cards\n\ntogether into a pile.\n I've pla 've so much solitaire, it 's become another art to me.\n I know a lot of different games, from clock solitaire to forty\n\nthieves, which is a two-deck version, to portable solitaire that you can play\n\nin one hand.\n The person who taught me portable solitaire said it was great for\n\nairplanes.\n\n\n  I still have staples left.\n Rice, flour, spices, that kind of thing.\n Some cans of tomato paste.\n I put a pan of water on to boil and measure out rice.\n I don't sit down to play again because I know that if I do I will\n\nlet the water boil down to nothing rather than interrupt my game.\n\n\n  I really should paint something, but I've be 'vetelling myself\n\nthat for days.\n My half-finished efforts, except for one, are stacked behind the\n\ntable.\n I hate most of them.\n I tried painting my hand holding a deck of cards, I tried painting a\n\ngroup of people playing poker, and finally I just tried to paint a big king\n\nof spades.\n When I noticed that it had Jason 's nose, I tore it up.\n I wander into my bedroom and throw a couple of dirty shirts into the\n\nclothes basket.\n I'm nor 'mlly very neat, it 's only during this dry spell - - that 's\n\nwhat I' 'llcall it, it has a nice ring - - that I'v 'vehrown my dirty clothes\n\ninto the corner instead of in the basket. \n\n  When I was finally ready to show Jason my place, my apartment\n\nthat was a studio even though it wasn't a studio apartment, I thought maybe I\n\nshould throw some things on the floor.\n It 's usually very clean, and I didn't want him to think I had\n\ncleaned up for him.\n We made love - - no, we had sex on my bed, which is really a\n\nmattress on the floor.\n He didn't stay the night, because his mother didn't know where he\n\nwas. \n\n  He was eight months younger than me.\n I had forgotten that people my age still lived with their parents,\n\nstill listened to their mothers, still called if they were going to be out\n\nlate.\n So he left me with kisses, saying he wished he could stay.\n At three in the morning I woke up and couldn't get back to sleep,\n\nbecause I could smell him in the sheets.\n It bothered me.\n I felt fiercely territorial about my place.\n So I got up and took a long shower and changed the sheets on the\n\nbed.\n I put the dirty ones in a pillowcase to separate them from the other\n\nuntainted laundry.\n Then I felt better, and I went back to sleep.\n The water is boiling, and I dump in the rice.\n I make a deal with myself that I can play solitaire, but I will\n\ninterrupt my game to get the rice.\n In payment for this, I am allowed to cheat.\n I have devised several ways of doing this.\n There are rules even for cheating.\n Sometimes I give myself permission to go through the deck more than\n\nthe specified number of times.\n Sometimes I can switch the positions of certain cards.\n Sometimes I let one card be wild.\n Tonight I play that black can go on black and red can go on red, but\n\nonly if they 're opposite suits. \n\n  Jason had this deck of cards that he had drilled a hole through.\n That was the first thing that I noticed when I met him.\n He had a job at the same warehouse I did, but in a different\n\ndepartment.\n It was my second summer there, and his first.\n He was going to work full time for a year, to earn money before he\n\nwent to college. \n\n  I came down to the break room for a Coke and he was playing\n\nsolitaire on the lunch table.\n I noticed that he didn't play very well, and that there was a hole\n\nin every single card.\n The holes weren't in the middle - - they were a little off center,\n\ntoward the top left corner.\n We were the only two people in the room.\n I knew better than to suggest moves to him.\n I also knew that everyone probably asked him about the holes in his\n\ncards, so I didn't.\n I just sat down across from him and drank my Coke.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c4bd7537-aea3-4a16-ac23-f19971e717eb", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.913567+00:00"}
{"text": "Efforts to fight sexual violence have a central place in the\n\nhistory of feminist aspiration.\n But many of today 's activists want to do more than ensure justice and\n\nsensitive treatment for victims.\n They want to restructur laws and institutions to reflect the view that\n\nrape, far from being an individual crime, is a social disease afflicting most\n\nmen.\n With a guilt-tripped male Senate falling over itself to demonstrate\n\ngender sensitivity, the activists have never had a better chance to codify\n\nthis new understanding of sexual violence.\n And they've almost succeeded.\n An unlikely 'velition of activists and politicians have joined forces\n\nto support the Violence Against Women Act of 1993, which would enhance\n\npenalties for violent crimes \" motivated by gender.\"\n\n  The bill has been heralded by Senator Joseph Biden, its chief\n\nsponsor, as \" the first comprehensive approach to fighting all forms of\n\nviolence against women, combining a broad array of needed reforms.\"\n But its central reform--turning some rapes into \" hate\" crimes--is not\n\nneeded.\n Its political base in an alliance between feminist absolutism and\n\npatriarchal condescension is inherently unstable, and anathema to sound law.\n By elevating motive over deed, anti-rape activists threaten to\n\nsubvert their movement 's main premise: that rapes are crimes of violence;\n\nthat no rapes are \" better\" or \" worse\" than others.\n\n  Biden, who has been lecturing on date rape since 1980, first\n\nintroduced the bill in 1990, warning his Senate colleagues that it would \"\n\nchange attitudes\" and \" test our assumptions.\" Not surprisingly, it never\n\nmade it to the floor.\n So to help promote his cause, Biden held four days of hearings,\n\nfeaturing the wrenching testimony of rape survivors.\n He interviewed experts.\n His staff even ginned up a sixty-five-page report, \" Response to\n\nRape: Detours on the Road to Equal Justice,\" which portrays the problem as\n\nworse than we ever supposed.\n\n  This year, thanks to Biden 's persistence and the fact that\n\nfeminism is a hot commodity in Washington, the bill is expected to sail\n\nthrough the Senate.\n \" There was a strong message sent in the last election that women and\n\nwomen 's issues were not being addressed in Congress,\" says Democratic Senator\n\nPatty Murray.\n \" That helps passage of bills like this.\" On May 27 the Senate\n\nJudiciary Committee approved the bill unanimously.\n It is expected to go to the floor sometime in the next few months,\n\nbuoyed by a bipartisan list of sixty-two co-sponsors.\n \" I predict the Senate will pass it unanimously,\" says Democrat\n\nCharles Robb.\n\n  But should it?\n Certainly the bill is not without merit.\n VAWA would, for example, establish new rules of evidence, limiting\n\nthe use of a victim 's clothing or sexual history in rape trials.\n It would also finance increased lighting and camera surveillance at\n\nbus stops and in parks.\n The heart of the bill, however, is its civil rights provision, which\n\nattempts to create a federal remedy for violent crimes committed on the basis\n\nof \" an animus based on the victim 's gender.\"\n Title 3, called \" Civil Rights for Women,\" would make sexual violence\n\na violation of federal civil rights law.\n \" This is the beginning, middle and end of the legislation,\" says\n\nBiden.\n In reclassifying rape, wife-beating and other gender-based felonies\n\nas bias crimes, the provision would write into law the view of rape as a\n\nsocially embedded institution.\n \" Rape as an expression of male dominance has been tolerated because\n\nof our society 's sexist attitudes,\" says Sally Goldfarb of the National\n\nOrganization for Women 's Legal Defense Fund.\n \" One of the advantages of the bill is that it codifies the true\n\nnature of rape.\"\n\n  Rape is a horrible crime, whether kindled by sexism or sheer\n\nnastiness.\n But rather than creating new penalties for bigoted thoughts and bad\n\nmotives, why not put in place the relatively straightforward remedy of\n\nstiffening jail sentences for rapists?\n Part of the problem, says Biden, was Democratic coalition politics.\n At first, women 's groups opposed his effort.\n \" Most of these people are way left,\" he explains.\n \" We wanted to increase jail terms and they said, 'Hey, that 's aimed\n\nat black males.'\"\n When he took out the stiffer-sentencing provisions, the women 's\n\ngroups jumped on board.\n\n  Biden sees rape as an almost normative condition of female\n\nexperience.\n \" It 's not just garbage cans and alleys,\" he says.\n \" It 's people with standing in the community.\n Feminist author Andrea Dworkin, who consulted\n\nwith Biden 's staff on the bill, takes this a step further.\n \" When Joe Biden or other men think about this, they're always acts\n\nthey would not 'remit, \" she says.\n \" They're always thinking about it in wa 'rethat exclude them.\n C 'reidering this world\n\nview, it 's no wonder the stiffened-sentences provision was tamped, down to \"\n\na sentencing commission to review offenses.\"\n The idea of harsh penalties would undermine the bill 's ideological\n\ncoherence.\n If rape is less a crime than a social pattern in which all men are\n\nimplicated, the cultural rationale for punishing those responsible\n\ndisappears.\n\n  Meanwhile, says Biden, \" Women are being victimized more and\n\nmore.\n And society 's doing less and less about it.\"\n Never mind Bureau of Justice Statistics that show the incidents of\n\nrape per 1,000 women declined 30 percent between 1980 and 1990.\n For Biden the problem is not so much empirical as philosophical.\n \" I have become convinced,\" he writes in the bill 's preamble, \" that\n\nviolence against women reflects as much a failure of our nation 's collective\n\nmoral imagination as it does the failure of our nation 's laws and\n\nregulations.\"\n\n  Biden will need considerable imagination to enforce the bill 's\n\ncivil rights provision.\n While there are rapists who hate women and use the act as a way of\n\nexpressing their hostility, they are in the minority.\n According to Richard Felson, a sociologist at SUNY-Albany who has\n\nstudied motives for sexual coercion, rape has never been successfully\n\ncorrelated with hostility toward women.\n \" Men who commit rape don't have any special attitude toward women,'\n\nhe says.\n \" They're versatile.\n\n\n  Civil libertarians, meanwhile, are troubled by the bill 's\n\nexplicit \" animus\" standard, which seems to permit an inquiry into bigoted\n\nthoughts and motives.\n \" There 's a big difference between criminal and civil cases for these\n\npurposes,\" notes Andrew Good, a Boston civil defense lawyer.\n \" With a civil case, you face the prospect of a very intrusive\n\ninvestigation of your views.\n It 's, 'Are you or have you ever been a sexist?'\n This is one of those well-intentioned, god-awful pieces of\n\nlegislation whose consequences only become apparent when it 's too late to get\n\nrepealed.\"\n Nevertheless, some in the Senate are not too worried.\n \" I'm willing to err on the side 'me bill comes down on,\" says' Robb.\n \" If it doesn't pass constitutional muster, so be it.\n\n\n  Meanwhile, differences over the scope of the civil rights\n\nprovision threaten to create rifts in the coalition.\n To the social constructionists, gender hatred is disclosed in the act\n\nof rape itself.\n \" Theoretically, I guess, a rape could take place that was not driven\n\nby gender animus,\" muses Biden.\n \" But I can't think of what it would be.\" Senator Orrin Hatch, the\n\nbill 's primary co-sponsor, sees things a little differently.\n \" You can make distinctions,\" he says.\n \" We're not opening the f 'reral doors to all gender-motivated crimes.\n Say you have a man who believes a woman is attractive.\n He feels encouraged by her and he 's so motivated by that\n\nencouragement that he rips her clothes off and has sex with her against her\n\nwill.\n Now let 's say you have another man who grabs a woman off some lonely\n\nroad and in the process of raping her says words like, 'You're wearing a\n\nsk 're!\n You're a woman!\n I hate women!\n I'm going to show you, y 'm woman!'\n Now, the first one 's terrible.\n But the other 's much worse.\n If a man rapes a woman while telling her he loves her, that 's a far\n\ncry from saying he hates her.\n A lust factor does not spring from animus.\"\n Senator Denni DeConcini, another co-sponsor, agrees with Hatch 's\n\ninterpretation.\n \" With the first example, you have only one major violation,\" he\n\nsays.\n \" But with the second example, you have two!\n What you've got there is 'veo crimes.\n They're subject to 'rearate determination.\"\n Apparently, hating women in general is worse than hating one in\n\nparticular.\n\n  Feminists who worked with the Judiciary Committee in drafting the\n\nbill are dismayed at these fumbling legalisms.\n \" That 's ridiculous,\" says Eleanor Smeal of the Fund for a Feminist\n\nMajority.\n \" Rape is never an act of lust.\n Mr. Hatch just doesn't get it.\" NOW 's Goldfarb agrees.\n Obviously, Hatch and DeConcini will have to be led around by the\n\nhand.\n Their befuddlement, however, points up a larger problem.\n By asking politicians and juries to make difficult distinctions\n\nbetween \" terrible\" and \" much worse\" rapes, the gender feminists are in\n\ndanger of reifying the very value judgments the date-rape movement sought to\n\neviscerate.\n \" There 's always that risk,\" says Dworkin.\n\n\n  Meanwhile, Dworkin claims to be surprised at the bill 's\n\npopularity in the Senate.\n \" The only possible explanation for it is that senators don't\n\nunderstand the meaning of the legislation they pass,\" she says.\n \" I expect that the more they understand, the narrower the margin of\n\nsupport will be.\"\n She may be right.\n Most of the bill 's co-sponsors seem to view the legislation as\n\nmerely the latest stop on the road of Anita Hill penance.\n \" Men need to be educated as to what others find offensive,\" says\n\nDeConcini.\n \" They might think it 's O.K.\n to rub somebody 's behind.\n But they need to learn that hey, unless you know that person well\n\nenough and you've tal 've about it, it 's not O.K.\n That 's what this is all about.\" Bob Packwood, Daniel Inouye and Ted\n\nKennedy apparently agree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Under Bill Clinton as well as George Bush, U.S. policy in Haiti\n\nhas threatened without delivering.\n The Haitian generals, masters of bluff and bravado themselves, see\n\nthis for what it is.\n it wants to\n\nreinstate democratic rule, but it doesn't--not really.\n In the past few weeks, however, the intransigence of the Haitian\n\nmilitary has been so embarrassing to the United States that the\n\nadministration has been forced to make good on a few of its threats.\n\n  Two weeks ago, responding to the Haitian generals' retreat from\n\nthe negotiating table, the United States finally revoked the visas and froze\n\nthe assets of some of the leaders and backers of the 1991 coup against Jean\n\nBertrand Aristide.\n Of course, since the Americans had threatened to do this for almost\n\ntwo years, there was not much left to freeze.\n The United States also agreed to support forthcoming U.N.-enforced\n\npetroleum and weapons sanctions against Haiti, after having closed its eyes\n\nto the leakiness of the OAS-Sponsored trade embargo that is theoretically\n\nstill in effect.\n Clinton put Marc Bazin, prime minister of the de facto regime, on\n\nhis assets list, sending a signal that Bazin is no longer the Americans' pet\n\npol.\n Once he lost his U.S.\n support, Bazin also lost his military backing and was forced to\n\nresign.\n Now that Haiti has no de facto president or prime Minister, the\n\nregime is openly military.\n\n  Old institutional ties within Haiti are a big reason it took the\n\nUnited States so long to get serious.\n Since its nineteen-year occupation of Haiti, which began in 1915,\n\nthe United States has had close links to Haiti 's light-skinned elite, whom\n\nthe Marine occupiers found more appealing than the country 's blacker, poorer\n\ncitizens.\n The occupation government ran customs, where its agents and officers\n\nworked with the elite business families of the  bord de mer  , which\n\nsupervised exports.\n The Marines installed a succession of mulatto puppet presidents and\n\ndeveloped a mulatto officer corps for what became the modern Haitian army.\n The military relationship remains strong.\n Generals Henry Namphy and Prosper Avril, two of Haiti 's\n\npost-Duvalier dictators, were trained in the United States, as were Raoul\n\nCedras, chief of staff under Aristide and leader of the coup against him, and\n\nMichel Francois, perhaps the most brutal of the anti-Aristide officers\n\nrunning the country.\n\n  In other words, the generals who led the coup against Aristide,\n\nand their business backers, had good reason to expect the United States not\n\nto push them too hard for Aristide 's return.\n They knew the U.S.\n Embassy and the U.S.\n Agency for International Development in Haiti harbored a deep\n\nantipathy to Aristide, whom the embassy had labeled \" a radical firebrand\"\n\nbefore he became a presidential candidate.\n Aristide was just the kind of leader--poor, country-bred, black--the\n\nMarines had fought in various anti-U.S.\n rebellions.\n He had no ties to the elite.\n\n\n  AID, on the other hand, was very much on the inside with\n\nPort-au-Prince society.\n The secretaries at the fancy AID office came from Haiti 's best\n\nfamilies.\n The embassy nurse, an American, was married to the scion of a\n\nwealthy elite clan, a man who participated in an abortive coup against\n\nAristide even before the new president was inaugurated.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6117fe7e-63c7-48ce-bfa5-17274e3fc653", "added":

{"text": "General - See inside front cover and pages 8 and 9 of the 1994\n\nannual report to stockholders for information about Union Carbide 's business.\n\n\n\n  On April 27, 1994, stockholders voted to approve the merger of\n\nUnion Carbide Corporation ( UCC) into Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics\n\nCompany Inc. ( UCC&P).\n The merger was effective May 1, 1994.\n Immediately after the merger, UCC&P had the same consolidated assets,\n\nliabilities and stockholders' equity as UCC.\n UCC&P has changed its name to Union Carbide Corporation.\n All references to Union Carbide Corporation, the corporation or UCC\n\nafter the periods starting May 1, 1994, are a reference to the merged\n\ncompany. \n\n  Union Carbide is engaged in the chemicals and plastics business.\n The chemicals and plastics industry, especially the commodity sector,\n\nis highly cyclical.\n Union Carbide is a major producer of certain commodity chemicals,\n\nprincipally ethylene glycol and polyethylene.\n Consequently, Union Carbide 's results are subject to the swings of\n\nthe cycle in those basic chemicals.\n See pages 4 through 7 of the 1994 annual report to stockholders for a\n\nfurther discussion. \n\n  Union Carbide does not produce against a backlog of firm orders;\n\nproduction is geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and to\n\nprojections of future demand.\n Inventories of finished products, work in process and raw materials\n\nare maintained to meet delivery requirements of customers and Union Carbide 's\n\nproduction schedules. \n\n  At year-end 1994, 12,004 people were employed worldwide in\n\napproximately 40 plants, factories and laboratories around the world. \n\n  Raw Materials, Products and Markets-See information herein and in\n\nthe 1994 annual report to stockholders on pages 8 and 9.\n Unless otherwise indicated, the products of Union Carbide are sold\n\nprincipally by its own sales force, directly to customers. \n\n  Union Carbide believes it has contracts or commitments for, or\n\nreadily available sources of, hydrocarbon feedstocks and fuel supplies to\n\nmeet its anticipated needs in all major product areas.\n The corporation 's operations are dependent upon the availability of\n\nhydrocarbon feedstocks and fuels which are purchased from diverse domestic\n\nand international sources, including independent oil and gas producers as\n\nwell as integrated oil companies. \n\n  The availability and price of hydrocarbon feedstocks, energy and\n\nfinished products are subject to plant interruptions and outages and to\n\nmarket and political conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n Operations and products at times may be adversely affected by\n\nlegislation, government regulations, shortages, or international or domestic\n\nevents. \n\n  Union Carbide is not dependent to a significant extent upon a\n\nsingle customer or a few customers. \n\n  Patents; Trademarks; Research and Development-Union Carbide owns\n\na large number of United States and foreign patents that relate to a wide\n\nvariety of products and processes, has pending a substantial number of patent\n\napplications throughout the world, and is licensed under a number of patents.\n These patents expire at various times over the next 20 years.\n Such patents and patent applications in the aggregate are material to\n\nUnion Carbide 's competitive position.\n No one patent is considered to be material; however, the patent\n\nportfolio relating to the UNIPOL polyethylene process technology is, in the\n\naggregate, considered to be material.\n Union Carbide also has a large number of trademarks.\n The UNION CARBIDE, UCAR and UNIPOL trademarks are material; no other\n\nsingle trademark is material. \n\n  Essentially all of Union Carbide 's research and development\n\nactivities are company-sponsored.\n The principal research and development facilities of Union Carbide\n\nare indicated in the discussion of Properties ( Item 2) of this Form 10-K\n\nreport.\n In addition to the facilities specifically indicated there, product\n\ndevelopment and process technology laboratories are maintained at some\n\nplants.\n Union Carbide spent\n\n&dollar;136 million in 1994,\n\n&dollar;139 million in 1993 and\n\n&dollar;155 million in 1992 on company-sponsored research activities to develop new\n\nproducts, processes, or services, or to improve existing ones. \n\n  Environment - See Costs Relating to Protection of the Environment\n\non pages 14 and 15 of the 1994 annual report to stockholders and Note 16 on\n\npages 35 and 36 thereof. \n\n  Insurance - Union Carbide 's policy is to obtain public liability\n\ninsurance coverage at terms and conditions and a price that management\n\nconsiders fair and reasonable.\n Union Carbide 's management believes Union Carbide has public\n\nliability insurance in an amount sufficient to meet its current needs in\n\nlight of pending, threatened, and future litigation and claims.\n There is no assurance, however, that Union Carbide will not incur\n\nlosses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of its insurance.\n\n\n  Competition - Each of the major products and services areas in\n\nwhich Union Carbide participates is highly competitive.\n In some instances competition comes from manufacturers of the same\n\nproducts as those produced by Union Carbide and in other cases from\n\nmanufacturers of different products which may serve the same markets as those\n\nserved by Union Carbide 's products.\n Some of Union Carbide 's competitors, such as companies principally\n\nengaged in petroleum operations, have more direct access to hydrocarbon\n\nfeedstocks, and some have greater financial resources than Union Carbide.\n\n\n\n  There are a number of competitors in each of the products and\n\nservices areas in which Union Carbide is active.\n In some of the individual areas in which Union Carbide participates\n\nthere are many competitors; in others there are few.\n Competition is primarily on price, on product performance and on\n\nservice to customers. \n\n  Many producers have important industry positions in polyethylene,\n\nand Union Carbide is one of the world 's largest producers.\n Other significant producers are Dow Chemical Company, Chevron\n\nCorporation, Exxon Corporation, Mobil Corporation, Novacor Chemicals Ltd,\n\nQuantum Chemicals Corporation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Phillips\n\nPetroleum Company, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation and The British\n\nPetroleum Company p.l.c. \n\n  Union Carbide is the world 's largest producer of ethylene\n\noxide/glycol and derivatives.\n Other significant producers include Shell Oil Company, Dow Chemical\n\nCompany, BASF Aktiengesellschaft, The British Petroleum Company p.l.c.,\n\nHuntsman Corporation, ICI p.l.c., Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Hoechst\n\nCelanese Corporation, and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation. \n\n  In solvents and intermediates and emulsion systems, Union Carbide\n\nhas a significant position in many product areas.\n Other significant producers include Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.,\n\nHoechst Celanese Corporation, Rohm & Haas Company, Eastman Chemical Company,\n\nShell Oil Company, Exxon Corporation, BASF Aktiengesellschaft and Quantum\n\nChemicals Corporation. \n\n  Union Carbide participates in a wide range of specialty chemical\n\nproduct/market areas.\n The competitive position varies widely from one product/market area\n\nto another.\n Competitors include a number of domestic and foreign companies, both\n\ndiversified and specialized. \n\n  Union Carbide is a major marketer of petrochemical products\n\nthroughout the world.\n Products that the corporation markets are largely produced in the\n\nUnited States, while competitive products are produced throughout the world.\n In addition, the corporation plans to make significant investments in\n\njoint ventures in 1995.\n See pages 4 through 7 of the 1994 annual report to stockholders for a\n\nfurther discussion. \n\n  Union Carbide 's international operations face competition from\n\nlocal producers and global competitors and a number of other risks inherent\n\nin carrying on business outside the United States, including risks of\n\nnationalization, expropriation, restrictive action by local governments and\n\nchanges in currency exchange rates. \n\n  In management 's opinion, current facilities, together with\n\nplanned expansions, will provide adequate production capacity to meet Union\n\nCarbide 's planned business activities.\n Capital expenditures are discussed on pages 17 and 19 of the 1994\n\nannual report to stockholders. \n\n  Listed below are the principal manufacturing facilities operated\n\nby Union Carbide worldwide.\n Research and engineering facilities are noted.\n Most of the domestic properties are owned in fee.\n Union Carbide maintains numerous domestic sales offices and\n\nwarehouses, substantially all of which are leased premises under relatively\n\nshort-term leases.\n All principal international operations manufacturing properties are\n\nowned or held under long-term leases.\n International operations administrative offices, technical service\n\nlaboratories, sales offices and warehouses are owned in some instances and\n\nheld under relatively short-term leases in other instances.\n The corporation 's headquarters are located in Danbury, Connecticut,\n\nand are leased. \n\n  Principal domestic operations manufacturing facilities and the\n\nprincipal products manufactured there are as follows: \n\n  Research and development are carried on at technical centers in\n\nBound Brook, Edison and Somerset, New Jersey; Tarrytown, New York; Cary,\n\nNorth Carolina; Washougal, Washington; and South Charleston, West Virginia.\n Process and design engineering is conducted at the technical center\n\nin South Charleston, West Virginia, in support of domestic and foreign\n\nprojects. \n\n  Principal international operations manufacturing facilities and\n\nthe principal products manufactured there are as follows: \n\n  Research and development are carried on at international\n\noperations facilities in Antwerp, Belgium; Montreal East, Canada; Cubatao,\n\nBrazil; Versoix, Switzerland; and Jurong, Singapore. \n\n  On September 28, 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\n\nEPA) announced the service of an administrative complaint on Rhone-Poulenc Ag\n\nCompany ( R-P) alleging violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery\n\nAct with respect to operation of the hazardous waste boiler at Institute,\n\nWest Virginia.\n The complaint seeks to assess a civil penalty of\n\n&dollar;915,125 against R-P.\n If the complaint is sustained, under an agreement between R-P and the\n\ncorporation, the corporation may be required to indemnify R-P for a portion\n\nof any penalty ultimately paid by R-P. \n\n  On February 23, 1994, the EPA issued a complaint and compliance\n\norder to the corporation alleging violations of Federal Hazardous Waste\n\nRegulations at the South Charleston, West Virginia, plant.\n The complaint seeks a civil penalty of\n\n&dollar;320,300.  The corporation is contesting the alleged violations and\n\nproposed penalty. \n\n  On March 31, 1994, the EPA issued an administrative Complaint,\n\nCompliance Order and Notice of Opportunity for Hearing to the corporation\n\nalleging violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as\n\namended, and the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act at the corporation 's Texas\n\nCity, Texas, plant.\n EPA proposes to assess a civil penalty of\n\n&dollar;139,000.  The corporation has requested a hearing and is contesting\n\nthe alleged violations and proposed penalty. \n\n  On February 14, 1995, the EPA issued a complaint to the\n\ncorporation alleging violations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and\n\nRodenticide Act with a proposed civil penalty of\n\n&dollar;400,000.  This matter concerns a discontinued medical instrument\n\nsterilant.\n The corporation voluntarily requested cancellation of its pesticide\n\nregistration. \n\n  As reported in the corporation 's Form 10-K for the period ended\n\nDecember 31, 1993, the EPA issued an administrative complaint to the\n\ncorporation on November 19, 1993, alleging violations of the Federal Clean\n\nAir Act at the Texas City, Texas, plant.\n The complaint sought a civil penalty of\n\n&dollar;194,550.  On October 13, 1994, the corporation and EPA reached a\n\nsettlement of this matter pursuant to which the corporation agreed to pay a\n\npenalty of\n\n&dollar;57,500. \n\n  The corporation did not submit any matters to a stockholder vote\n\nduring the last quarter of 1994. \n\n  Market and dividend information for the corporation 's common\n\nstock is contained on pages 18 and 19 of the 1994 annual report to\n\nstockholders.\n The stock exchanges where the stock is traded are listed on page 38\n\nof the 1994 annual report to stockholders.\n The declaration of dividends is a business decision made from time to\n\ntime by the Board of Directors based on the corporation 's earnings and\n\nfinancial condition and other factors the Board considers relevant. \n\n  The number of stockholders of record of the corporation 's common\n\nstock is contained on page 1 of the 1994 annual report to stockholders. \n\n  Information pertaining to consolidated operations is included\n\nunder the captions \" From the Income Statement,\" and \" From the Balance Sheet\n\n( At Year-End)\", and dividend information is included under the caption \"\n\nOther Data\" in the Selected Financial Data on page 19 of the 1994 annual\n\nreport to stockholders. \n\n  The consolidated balance sheet of Union Carbide Corporation and\n\nsubsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated statements\n\nof income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the\n\nthree-year period ended December 31, 1994, together with the report thereon\n\nof KPMG Peat Marwick LLP dated January 19, 1995, are contained on pages 20\n\nthrough 37 of the 1994 annual report to stockholders. \n\n  Quarterly income statement data is contained on page 18 of the\n\n1994 annual report to stockholders. \n\n  Item 9.\n Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and\n\nFinancial Disclosure \n\n  Union Carbide has not had any disagreements covered by this item\n\nwith KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, its independent auditors. \n\n  For background information on the Directors of Union Carbide\n\nCorporation whose terms are expected to continue after the annual meeting of\n\nstockholders and persons nominated to become Directors, see pages 9 through\n\n13 of the proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders to be held\n\non April 26, 1995.\n C.

{"text": "Thupstan is twelve years old.\n He has a mother, father, sister, and brother, but he hasn't lived with\n\nthem for six years.\n Thupstan doesn't play ball.\n In fact, he doesn't play sports at all.\n Thupstan doesn't own any pants.\n He 's not allowed to wear them.\n Thupstan doesn't eat meat.\n\n\n  Thupstan doesn't watch TV, listen to music, go shopping, grow his\n\nhair long, or talk with many girls.\n Thupstan is a Buddhist monk.\n There are nineteen Thupstans living at Rizong monastery in Ladakh, a\n\nremote Himalayan region in northern India.\n Ranging in age from five to fourteen, they all take their name from\n\nKhan Rimpoche Gyalsras Thupstan Nima Langstochs Stanzing Nerbu, the head\n\nmonk, who is the living reincarnation of the monastery 's founder.\n Rizong is one of more than 100 monasteries that dot this arid,\n\nhigh-altitude plateau.\n\n\n  In many ways, Thupstan is the embodiment of all that is Ladakhi\n\nsociety today.\n His simple, isolated lifestyle reflects a traditional culture and\n\nvalue system that are markedly different from those being carried into Ladakh\n\nfrom the outside world today.\n Moreover, like the larger society his monastery is a part of,\n\nThupstan will soon be forced to shed his isolation and come to terms with the\n\noutside world.\n The choices he will be forced to make parallel those facing Ladakhi\n\nsociety at large.\n\n  For centuries, Buddhism has been the dominant force shaping\n\nLadakhi life and ways of thought.\n Traditionally, Buddhist monasteries were the cultural, educational,\n\nand spiritual centers of the greater community.\n Monks were preachers and teachers, presiding and offering their\n\nservices at all important occasions of family and social life.\n Devoutly practicing the faith and turning to their Buddhist clergy\n\nfor guidance and advice regarding this life and the next, people reserved\n\ntheir highest respect for those dedicated to the search for spiritual\n\nenlightenment.\n Until quite recently, at least one member of every Buddhist family\n\nlived and worked at a monastery.\n Sending a son into monastic service was thought to accrue karmic\n\nmerit for the family - according to Buddhist doctrine, the equivalent of\n\ngiving eyes to 100 blind men.\n These beliefs are still widely held, as evidenced by the presence of\n\nThupstan and his fellow novices at Rizong Monastery.\n\n  The approach to Rizong is a difficult one.\n The monastery is situated in an isolated valley, five kilometers walk\n\nfrom the nearest road.\n The English translation of Rizong is \" mountain fort.\" The Ladakhi\n\nword for monastery,  gompa  , means \" solitary place.\" Both words\n\naptly describe its setting.\n Founded only 170 years ago, it is not one of Ladakh 's oldest\n\nmonasteries.\n Rizong, however, is a reformed monastery of the Ge-Lug-Pa ( Model of\n\nVirtue) sect, and its monks maintain strict adherence to the 253 rules of\n\nmonastic life, which govern everything from their hairstyles to their sex\n\nlives.\n So as to detach themselves from worldly desires, which beget\n\nignorance and hinder an individual 's efforts to attain enlightenment, the\n\nmonks lead a minimal life.\n They are often found in group or solitary meditation, attempting to\n\nattain the attributes of their deities and a state of enlightenment, which\n\nleads to nirvana - union with the cosmic whole - or Buddhahood.\n\n  The lives of the novices are much less regimented than those of\n\ntheir older role models; however, theirs too are lives of strict routine.\n Thupstan, who joined the monastery at five, climbs out of the\n\nnovices' communal dormitory at 4:3O a.m.\n every morning.\n The other novices and a rough woolen blanket are all he has to\n\nprotect himself from winter temperatures as low as - 30 degrees centigrade.\n Shoving his feet into a pair of ragged canvas tennis shoes, he pads\n\noff through a labyrinth of passageways to the kitchen.\n En route he collects a load of wood to stoke the morning fire.\n Once in the kitchen, he joins three of the older novices, who attend\n\nto the preparation of the morning meal when not amusing themselves by hitting\n\neach other with sticks.\n An advanced monk serves as the manager of the monastery 's mundane\n\naffairs.\n Nineteen junior monks are largely responsible for the monastery 's\n\nday-to-day operation.\n They cook, clean, gather firewood, gaze animals, carry water, and\n\nserve the temporal needs of the elder monks.\n\n  The kitchen is the focal point of the novices' regimen.\n The room is dark and smoky, dominated by a large mud-brick oven.\n The low rafters and walls are covered with soot and lined with butter\n\nchurns, tea cisterns, and huge brass pots.\n With practiced efficiency the novices knead dough, stoke the fire,\n\nand stir a cauldron, which bubbles on the stove.\n The menu never varies: a brackish soup of barley noodles and turnip\n\ngreens for breakfast and a hardened ball of parched barley flour dipped in\n\nbuttermilk for lunch.\n Both meals are washed down with salted butter tea.\n These are the daily staples of the Ladakhi and Tibetan diet.\n According to Rizong 's rule, no one is allowed dinner, but the rule is\n\nbent for the youngest of the novices.\n\n  The other novices gradually appear for breakfast, huddling around\n\nthe stove for warmth and using twigs to help slurp the hot soup into their\n\nmouths from wooden bowls.\n Most have several bowlfuls.\n After breakfast they move off to attend to their morning chores.\n A few stay behind to complete the half-hearted cleanup that is\n\ntypical of young boys everywhere.\n Nothing in the monastery is ever really clean, particularly the monks\n\nthemselves.\n\n  The boys present a curious picture, caring for themselves and\n\ntheir home at an age when most boys are still being coddled by their parents.\n No one insists that they wash behind their ears, and they don't; the\n\ndirt clings to their saffron robes and bodies in layers.\n They go home rarely, if ever.\n When asked if they miss their families, the chorus of earnest \" No 's\"\n\nis convincing.\n\n  A visit by one of the boy 's fathers belies their protestations.\n The unscheduled reunion is at first rather formal.\n After more than a year 's separation, the father and his\n\nfourteen-year-old son sit down to tea and make stilted conversation.\n The boy 's excitement is obvious, but he seems confused about how to\n\ntreat his father, alternating between calculated formality and sheepish\n\ngrins.\n Eventually, his determination to maintain formality dissolves, and he\n\nallows himself to show the enthusiasm that he feels, proudly showing off his\n\nnew home and position.\n The other novices pay close attention, and at the lunch time meal,\n\nthey cling to the stranger, as if hoping to draw some familial warmth from\n\nhim.\n The reunion is brief and the atmosphere soon returns to normal, but\n\nit is a poignant reminder of the isolation of these young men.\n\n  Few boys choose to come to a monastery themselves, but they are\n\nall aware that their presence there has a purpose.\n This purpose is evident in every facet of their lives, but is never\n\nforced upon them.\n The novices spend little time studying Buddhist doctrine and play\n\nlittle active role in the monk 's daily prayer sessions.\n Buddhism seeks to guide the individual to enlightenment through\n\nmeditation and the development of inner consciousness.\n It does not demand obedience to an authoritarian god, and likewise,\n\nlittle is demanded of the novices, save their adherence to their monastic\n\nchores and school work.\n Days melt into months and months into years.\n The austerity and isolation of the monastic setting instill a sense\n\nof timelessness and separation from the outside world.\n Presumably, this will help the novices discover the path to\n\nenlightenment on their own.\n\n  After breakfast, Thupstan takes the monastery 's cattle out to\n\ngraze.\n Their bodies dwarf his small frame, but he is accustomed to the task\n\nand herds them deftly with a stick and a few well aimed rocks, singing all\n\nthe while and hopping between rocks.\n He is a curious and intelligent boy, with a strong sense of his\n\nstation in life.\n Above all, he wants to grow up and be a good monk.\n His reasoning is simple.\n \" Here we don't have to worry about getting married or working,\" he\n\nsays.\n \" We can study and learn languages.\"\n Monastic schools still provide some of the best primary education in\n\nLadakh.\n\n\n  The schoolhouse is ramshackle.\n Like the novices' one- room communal dwelling, it is located at the\n\nlower end of the monastery 's grounds, symbolizing their lowly status in the\n\nmonastic hierarchy and the intellectual distance they must travel in order to\n\nattain enlightenment.\n Every morning except Sunday, two blackboards are wheeled out, and\n\nafter a few prayers and the singing of the Indian national anthem, classes\n\nget under way.\n The atmosphere is not unlike that of a village schoolhouse, with a\n\nscholarly monk dividing his time between two classes and the novices taking\n\nturns to direct the singsong recitation of the sentences he writes on the\n\nblackboard.\n The subject material contains fragments of Buddhist philosophy, but\n\nalso includes exercises in stilted English ( \" Is the gun big?\" \" Is this\n\nMary 's bicycle?\").\n The students earnestly copy their lessons into tattered notebooks\n\nusing pencil stubs sharpened on rocks.\n One of the novices occasionally runs out to chase down an errant cow,\n\nan event that might lead to general chaos in another school but hardly\n\nelicits a sidelong glance here.\n The novices apply themselves with a seriousness that belies their\n\nage.\n\n  This seriousness dissolves immediately as the boys dart out of\n\nthe school-yard at the end of the day.\n They throw rocks, taunt and tease the elder monks, or simply lie in a\n\nfield and daydream.\n When asked what they would like to do when they grow up, the response\n\nis predictable \" I want to be a monk.\"\n They don't act like it when they're at 'reay, and it would probably be\n\nsafe to say that it 's not the subject of most of their daydreams.\n Like most boys, they hate doing nothing, and the lack of distractions\n\nat Rizong may be the reason why so much of their energy is channeled into\n\nschool.\n\n  The monastic schools of Ladakh have recently introduced a\n\nstandardized curriculum.\n In addition to math, today 's novices learn to read and write in\n\nTibetan, Urdu, Hindi, and English.\n They will need all four languages to understand the Buddhist\n\nscriptures, their fellow Ladakhis, Indians, and the world at large.\n The new curriculum is both a response to Ladakh 's isolation from\n\nChinese-occupied Tibet, to which it used to send its novices for higher\n\neducation, and a tacit admission that Ladakh is no longer isolated from the\n\noutside world.\n\n  Remote as Ladakh is, it is experiencing a growing tourist\n\nindustry and a steadily expanding presence of Indian soldiers and merchants.\n The tourists come to enjoy Ladakh 's rich cultural heritage, the\n\nsoldiers defend India from Pakistan and China, and the merchants are\n\ndeveloping a nascent commercial market.\n With their invasion of material prosperity and technological\n\nprogress the tourists and Indians represent a threat to the austerity and\n\nisolation of traditional Ladakhi life and monastic service, which no longer\n\nhold their universal attraction.\n As one young Ladakhi puts it, \" To become a monk, you have to give\n\nup all the good things in life.\"\n\n  Thupstan is conscious and curious about the outside world, but\n\nlargely ignorant of the choices he will soon be forced to make.\n Flipping through a copy of a western magazine, he points to an\n\nadvertisement and says, \" This one good.\"\n His worldly desires have been raised to a\n\n&dollar;6,000 Rolex watch.\n Shortly thereafter, he spots a picture of a scantily clad woman,\n\ngiggles, and runs his finger over the glossy page.\n Given the chance to go where he would like, he immediately answers,\n\n\" America.\"\n Why?\n \" For the pleasure,\" he says.\n While he may never get the chance to go to America, he will almost\n\ncertainly go to Choglamsar, which in its way may prove just as\n\nimpressive.\n\n  Choglamsar, a dusty collection of mud shacks and Tibetan refugee\n\nsettlements eight kilometers outside Ladakh 's capital city of Leh, is the\n\nsite of the Central Institute for Buddhist Studies ( CIBS).\n Established in 1959 as a higher education center for Ladakhi novices\n\nwho could no longer enter a conquered Tibet, the center is today a sprawling\n\ncomplex serving 35O students.\n It is funded by the Indian government - meaning that CIBS cannot\n\ndiscriminate on the basis of age, sex, race, or religious belief.\n As a result, 85 percent of its students are lay people, who are\n\ndrawn by the institute 's ability to offer 150 rupee (\n\n&dollar;6) per month scholarships and its reputation as a school dedicated to the\n\npreservation of Ladakhi culture.\n\n  While this mission is both admirable and necessary, the reality\n\nfor novices in attendance there is another matter.\n In a matter of hours, they are transported from the isolation of the\n\nmonastery into a world of sunglasses, hightop tennis shoes, modish\n\nhairstyles, music, and girls.\n The modern Lakakhi youth is a slick operator, and, for novices, the\n\ncontrast here could not be more striking.\n They adapt quickly to this new world, and while they are not allowed\n\nto discard their monastic robes, it is not uncommon to see a novice sporting\n\na pair of Ray Bans and hightops and striking a cool pose while hanging out\n\nbetween lectures.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ad041ab0-585f-4bb0-8197-bde351e48a95", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.917608+00:00"}
{"text": "1a) In class, we defined language from a nativist/Chompskian point of\n\nview as, \" a universal grammar that all humans have,\" that is learned through\n\nan innate language acquisition device and exposure.\n It is impossible to fully determine Beth 's linguistic competence ( her\n\nunconscious knowledge of linguistic structure and rules) from a single\n\nlanguage sample, but I am able use this particular linguistic performance (\n\nhow she uses her linguistic competence in speech) to say something about her\n\ncurrent language usage.\n I believe that Brown would place Beth just past the two-word phase,\n\nperhaps at the beginning of \" later combinatory speech\" due to the way she is\n\ncombining functors like my and that to string together simpler 2-word phrases\n\n( Lindfors).\n For example, rather than saying \" Peggy baby\" ( agent + object), Beth\n\nsays, \" That Peggy baby.\"\n Rather than saying \" I find\" ( agent + action), Beth says, \" I find\n\nyours.\"\n Beth has some working knowledge of possessives ( \" my\" and \" Peggy\n\nbaby\") and simple syntax.\n While pure nativists would only be interested in these child\n\nutterances and word structure, Brown ( who was already expanding nativist\n\nlanguage theory) would insist that we look at the mother-child interaction as\n\nwell.\n Beth is not yet using inflectional endings, but if Nora 's numerous\n\nimitations and expansions ( e.g. \" That 's my baby.\"; \" It 's Peggy 's baby?\")\n\nreally scaffold her verbal progression as Brown suggests, this might be\n\nexpected soon in Beth 's linguistic performance. 1b) Interactionists\n\nlike Clark and Halliday view language as \" meaning potential.\"\n For them, social interaction is both a component of and goal for\n\nlanguage construction ( Halliday).\n Clark 's use-based approach would insist that we look at both the\n\nacquisition of structure ( see number 1) and function of language.\n For example, I notice that Beth 's speech often functions in a\n\nregulatory or instrumental capacity.\n Beth says, \" My,\" when Nora threatens to take her baby in order to\n\nregulate Nora 's behavior.\n She responds, \" I find yours,\" when Nora asks where her baby doll is\n\nand proceeds to go look for it.\n She is attempting to get something done.\n Nora 's speech, on the other hand, is heuristic- she is \" teaching\"\n\nBeth about teasing.\n In this respect, Nora 's role as \" teacher\" might be to enact a\n\nteasing schema through her interaction with Beth.\n Even though Beth fails to understand that her mother is teasing her,\n\nand this could be \" thought of as failed attempt to construct the adult world\n\nview ( Halliday, p. 122)\", Beth is learning through language to construct her\n\nown reality.\n For example, in this interaction, she seemed to learn something about\n\nsharing and pretending.\n She also responding to commands and questions and takes turns\n\nspeaking with Nora. \n\n  1c) When I consider Beth 's communicative competence ( or her\n\nsituational ability to effectively convey meaning), I need to think about her\n\nlinguistic competence, cultural practice, and the particular communicative\n\nevent, which are all demonstrated through her linguistic performance ( Class\n\nNotes 9/23/09).\n It becomes important now to know that Beth is part of a working class\n\nEuropean American family.\n Heath 's research found differences in the way white working-class\n\ncommunities, black working-class communities, and middle-class communities\n\ntalk to their children.\n This communicative event between Beth and Nora could be seen as a\n\nteasing event or a caregiver socialization event, which I suspect are more\n\npopular cultural practices in working class homes than in middle-class homes.\n Through play, Nora is teaching ( and Beth is learning) about what it\n\nmeans to be a caregiver, and how to effectively engage in teasing. \n\n  2a) The interactionist theory of language could potentially judge\n\nCindy as \" verbally deprived\" in language because in the school language\n\nsample she uses very short sentences ( e.g. \" A dog\", \" I dunno\"), doesn't\n\ndemonstrate mastery of the concept of what a dog is ( the teacher doesn't\n\nunderstand why he doesn't have legs), and doesn't convey logical thoughts (\n\nAdger, pp. 74-75).\n When the teacher asks Cindy to tell her about a part of the picture ( \"\n\nWhat 's this bit here?\") Cindy simply responds with, \" I dunno.\"\n You can trace this line of thinking to interactionists reviewing\n\nsingle interactions in school settings, particularly between teachers and\n\nminority students, without a consideration of socio-cultural factors. \n\n  2b) Possible reasons for Cindy 's varied language behaviors\n\ninclude that she has learned avoidance techniques for speaking in school,\n\nwhere her language can be held against her and/or that there is a mismatch\n\nbetween Cindy 's and the school 's interaction styles ( Adger, p. 76).\n Since, \" schools generally align with the cultural traditions\n\nassociated with the middle class\" ( Adger, p. 73) and Cindy is from a working\n\nclass family this is likely to be the case.\n For example, the purpose, channel of communication, and interaction\n\nrules are different in this school speech event than in the home speech event\n\ndescribed ( Hymes).\n The purpose of this school event is to quickly describe Cindy 's\n\ndrawing, the channel of communication is written and oral Standard English,\n\nand the interaction rules follow a traditional teacher question-student\n\nresponse format.\n On the other hand, the purpose of this home interaction is inquiry\n\ndriven and purposeful- Cindy wants to figure out how to make the water in her\n\ngarden stay in the ground.\n The channel of communication is an informal oral Standard English.\n The interaction rules are different too.\n Cindy is allowed to ask questions and talk through her thinking,\n\nrather than answering directed questions.\n When these differences in the elements of the communicative events\n\nare examined, it is not surprising that her language behavior varies so\n\ndramatically in these situations. \n\n  2c) Cazden et al. might advise Cindy 's teacher to improve the\n\nquality of her talk by, \" shifting [ her] role and behavior\"from that of an\n\ninterviewer to that of a resource for children to draw upon\" ( p. 120).\n The teacher should be at the center of a free exchange of ideas,\n\nrather than a requester of information she already knows.\n She might also encourage the teacher to develop a warm and trusting\n\nrelationship with Cindy, and to design a curriculum focused on cultural\n\npluralism that draws on what children already know and that allows for\n\nauthentic inquiry into meaningful tasks ( Cazden, pp. 120-124).\n For example, she might use her knowledge that Cindy loves gardening\n\nto design science inquiry experiments or let Cindy and the other students\n\nteach each other about their areas of \" expertise.\"\n\n\n  3a) As discussed in question 2b, the nature of communicative\n\nevents has the power to optimize learning and language opportunities,\n\nparticularly if it matches students' home/cultural interaction styles and\n\nexpectations.\n In this ESL module, the teacher is both building on and expanding\n\nfamiliar language practices for her students- she asks them to move from\n\nwriting their opinions about a topic that matters to them ( a familiar\n\nwriting task) to eliciting information from others and reporting on what they\n\nhave to say about it ( a new writing task).\n She asks her ESL students to interview other native language speakers\n\n( familiar interactions) and students and teachers who speak English as a\n\nfirst language ( likely unfamiliar interactions).\n She carefully scaffolds the entire module to build on familiar\n\nlanguage activities in order to expand students' repertoire to include the\n\nunfamiliar.\n I also thought the purposes and mood of the communicative events in\n\nthis module were critical to enhancing learning opportunities.\n Some of the purposes included capitalizing on students' experiences\n\nand creating an authentic and meaningful writing project.\n The mood was positive and celebratory of bilingual identities and\n\nexperiences.\n The teacher clearly sought to capitalize on students' languages and\n\ncultural competence to enhance learning when she structured this module. \n\n  3b) In this ESL module, students learned language by constructing\n\nmeaning ( rather than acquiring structure) throughout the entire research and\n\nwriting process.\n As the students spoke and wrote in English they concurrently built\n\nall parts of the three-level system Halliday described where \" meanings are\n\ncoded into wordings and wordings are recoded into sound\" ( p. 115).\n Students learned through language ( or constructed reality) as they\n\nbuilt positive bilingual identities, and discovered new methods to gather\n\ninformation and structure writing.\n They learned about language ( \" coming to understand the nature and\n\nfunction of language itself\", p. 16) by explicitly exploring various\n\nfunctions of language and bilingualism. \n\n  4a) The first thing I would suggest to middle school teachers\n\nresponsible for crafting a language policy is to create their own definition\n\nof language based on research.\n To do this, I would ask them to explore the differences in language\n\nbeliefs in the linguistic and teaching communities.\n I think it is important that teachers ( like students) are allowed to\n\ncreate meaning, rather than having it pushed on them by \" experts.\"\n That said, I would try to ignite a discussion about language in\n\nschools.\n I would let them know that while prescriptive grammar ( a cultural\n\nconstruction that often involves explicit teaching of the grammar \" rules\" of\n\nStandard English) is often taught in schools today, it has no linguistic\n\nbasis.\n The \" standard\" English that they were likely taught, is really just\n\nthe \" socially preferred dialect\" ( a social or geographical variety of\n\nlanguage) of American society ( Adger).\n However, there is nothing that makes this particular dialect ( or any\n\nlanguage, for that matter) inherently better than any other.\n I would also point out to them that everyone speaks a dialect, and\n\nthat spoken and written languages vary greatly in formality.\n I would expect some push back from Mr. Clark at this point, who would\n\nlikely claim that Standard English is actually better than other languages\n\nbecause it has rules and we read it in books.\n He might cite technology as the current culprit of the degradation of\n\nStandard English.\n I would respond by telling him that linguists are interested in\n\nlanguage rules, and that all dialects have rules that people adhere to when\n\nthey speak, even \" nonstandard\" Englishes ( socially unacceptable dialects;\n\ne.g. AAVE).\n I might refer him to the Ebonics debate and remind him that published\n\nwriting has traditionally been maintained by the same elite group that uses\n\nstandard English.\n I would tell him that linguists, who study descriptive grammar (\n\nobjective analysis of language structures and differences), would be\n\ninterested in analyzing the structure and function of the language of\n\ntechnology rather than judging it. \n\n  4b) Linguists believe that language is primarily learned through\n\ninteraction, not direct instruction.\n To help teachers understand this idea ( that \" implicit\" teaching\n\noccurring through interaction is more effective than \" explicitly\" teaching\n\nsets of syntactic rules) I might ask them to recall their own experiences\n\ndiagramming sentences and \" learning\" grammar.\n Chances are, they have forgotten everything and/or have very strong\n\nnegative reactions to experiences with direct grammar instruction.\n \" Explicit\" grammar instruction is often not effective, enjoyable, or\n\nfunctional.\n \" For educational purposes we need a grammar that is functional\n\nrather than formal, semantic rather than syntactic in focus, oriented towards\n\ndiscourse rather than towards sentences, and represents language as a\n\nflexible resource rather than a rigid set of rules\" ( Halliay, p. 124).\n I might direct them towards resources such as Writing in Rhythm by\n\nMaisha Fisher or The Power of Grammar by Mary Ehrenworth, where the authors\n\nshow possibilities for learning the \" rules\" of Standard English ( i.e. \"\n\ngrammar\") through modeling, interaction, and inquiry rather than the\n\ntraditional direct instruction approach.\n I would expect Mr. Clark and other middle school educators to bring\n\nup the valid point that inquiry and discussions take time, and time is\n\nsomething in high-demand during NCLB-era teaching.\n My best advice on this is that the quick and easy way is rarely more\n\neffective or worthwhile than the long and difficult one. \n\n  4c) Finally, I would focus on the great language debate in\n\nschools today, which concerns the speech practices of particular\n\nnon-mainstream cultural groups ( Genishi & Dyson).\n I would remind teachers that their implicit and explicit beliefs\n\nabout language affect children 's identity development, interactions, and\n\nopportunities to use and learn language.\n I would urge teachers to \" embrace the normalcy of difference\" (\n\nGenishi & Dyson, p. 237) and to view students' languages- whatever they may\n\nbe- from a capacity, rather than a deficit, framework.\n To help teachers understand the competences their students bring, I\n\nmight suggest that they plan varieties of \" recurrent, interactive events\"\n\nwhere they can really listen to students ( Genishi & Dyson), that they listen\n\nto students in both classroom and non-classroom settings, and/or that they\n\nconduct research in their own classrooms to gain insight into their students'\n\nlanguage patterns ( Adger).\n The teachers will likely notice that their students, particularly\n\nminority students, have amazing communicative flexibility ( ability to adapt\n\ntheir dialects to communicate effectively in varying situations).", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "be719b58-4e38-44d8-90a3-5495dcd5f748", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.919119+00:00"}

- well, it was a big secret\n\nthat I wasn't supposed to know about.\n I had immediately jumped to the conclusion that our esteemed county\n\nprosecuting attorney wanted some more free advice from Max.\n And was getting impatient with Max 's travels.\n It was, after all, the final week of his re-election campaign.\n \" Well, I got a postcard from Max a week ago.\n An absolutely lovely picture of a genuine Palm Beach swimming pool.\n Want to come in, while I try to find it?\n\n\n  That 's about when I realized that I'd forgotten to turn off th 'd\n\nshower.\n I pulled my thin robe tighter in compensation for this\n\nall-too-audible shortcoming.\n Let him think that I showered with a companion, I thought,\n\nremembering that California bumper sticker from drought days, Don't Shower\n\nAlone! \n\n  \" It 's back in the kitchen,\" I said, a little too loudly.\n \" That 's where the old mail resides on its way to the recycling can.\n One of these days, I'm going to rig a chute down t 'mthe alley, so all\n\nthe junk mail can go straight into the recycle.\n And land with a satisfying crash.\"\n My mind wasn't really in gear yet.\n Those were just warm-up exercises.\n I'm better after a shower, a gl 'ms of grapefruit juice, and a double\n\nshot of espresso.\n\n\n  I rummaged through the accumulation on the back of the kitchen\n\ntable, laying aside the old Wall Street Journal and New York Times issues\n\nthat needed tossing out.\n And there the postcard was, showing an unnaturally blue swimming\n\npool, surrounded by nondescript hotel balconies totally lacking in\n\nindividuality, topped by some cottony clouds that looked like overdone\n\ndigital retouching to my jaundiced eye. \n\n  I looked at the flip side.\n \" It 's the ` Sunrise Hotel on Route A1A,' it says here.\n Not his usual sort of hotel, I must say.\n He usually stays at the best place in town.\"\n I passed him the postcard after noting that Max hadn't written\n\nanything more than a sarcastic \" Dearest Kate -

{"text": "If fibers were indeed a structural component of the wing, then\n\nthey, rather than the ambiguous impressions of the wing membrane, may be the\n\nbest indicator of a pterosaur wing 's shape.\n And according to the fibers, pterosaurs had narrow, birdlike wings\n\nthat attached at the hip or the mid- thigh.\n Rayner, whose specialty is animal aerodynamics, says the fibers would\n\nhave given the wings so much stiffness that a pterosaur wouldn't have needed\n\nto keep its wings taut with its feet, as a bat does.\n Instead the fibers would have acted more like a bird 's stiff feather\n\nshafts, which, when the bird brings its wing down, transfer the lift\n\ngenerated by the wing to the rest of the body.\n\n  The shape of pterosaur wings must have affected not only how they\n\nflew but also how they moved on the ground.\n Birds, with their wings free of their hind legs, can walk easily.\n But bats have to deal with two problems: their wings connect their\n\narms to their legs, and their legs are designed to swing out to the side.\n In flight this keeps the wing membrane tight, but on the ground it\n\nmakes a bat 's legs too loose to support the weight of its body.\n As a result, bats crawl on all fours, with their long arms and\n\nflexible legs splayed out to the sides.\n\n  Just as pterosaurs' wings were designed for birdlike flight,\n\nPadian maintains, their legs were designed for bipedal, birdlike walking.\n He points out that the head of their femur was oriented to swing the\n\nleg forward and backward, not side to side, and their ankle bones had fused\n\ninto a hinge that couldn't bend out in a sprawl.\n Far from crawling on all fours, he says, pterosaurs walked on two\n\nlegs as comfortably as a dinosaur or a bird--which, Padian argues, shouldn't\n\nbe surprising.\n \" They really are coming from fairly similar ancestral stocks,\" he\n\nsays, \" and so a lot of what they do is going to be predisposed to be\n\nsimilar.a\n Pterosaurs with wings folded up on either side also leave their hands\n\nrelatively free for handling food or climbing trees.\n\n  But the traditional batlike stance still charms many\n\npaleontologists.\n \" I find myself with the fuddy-duddies dotted around the world,\" says\n\nDavid Unwin of the University of Bristol.\n \" In our humble opinion, the legs sort of stick out sideways and the\n\nanimals tend to sprawl somewhat on the ground and walk around in a\n\nquadrupedal fashion.a\n Unwin, along with Wellnhofer, has argued that the hips of pterosaurs\n\nhad sockets unsuited for walking on two legs.\n If a pterosaur tried to walk upright, they maintain, the pelvis\n\nwouldn't bear directly down on the femur and the femur heads would tend to\n\npop out of their sockets.\n \" I think you can get pterosaur hind limbs into a bipedal position in\n\nthe same way I can do a split,\" says Unwin.\n\n\n  Padian counters that what might seem unlikely judging from only\n\none part of a skeleton becomes possible when you add supporting cartilage and\n\nmuscle.\n \" What pterosaurs can't do,\" Padian adds, \" is jerk the hind limb out\n\nto the side in exactly the way a bat does it.a \n\n  Recently, Christopher Bennett of the University of Kansas gave\n\nsome of Padian 's ideas a new twist.\n By tilting the hip 60 degrees from the horizontal, he found that a\n\nprotruding part of the socket 's rim was positioned so that it could bear down\n\non a femur head.\n A pterosaur with such a hip wouldn't be hunched over like a bird; it\n\nwould be upright, something between a gorilla and a human.\n Instead of walking on its toes, it would roll back on its heels and\n\nkeep its feet flat on the ground.\n Pterosaurs standing as tall as 20 feet might have strolled along the\n\nbanks of lagoons with a humanlike gait.\n\n  ONCE YOU KNOW how an extinct animal moved--whether it crawled or\n\nran, flapped its wings or only glided--you can get an idea of how it fit into\n\nthe ecological web of its time.\n If, as Padian argues, pterosaurs flew more like birds than bats, then\n\none would expect them to play birdlike roles in their ecology as well.\n\n  Rayner and graduate student Grant Hazelhurst have found evidence\n\nfor this idea in the geometry of pterosaur bodies.\n Previous research has shown that the ratios determined by a flying\n\nanimal 's mass, wingspan, and wing surface area predict what kind of flight\n\nstyle it will have.\n Forest birds share similar ratios, while soarers have their own set,\n\nas do the insect eaters, divers, and so on.\n Rayner and Hazelhurst found that the combination of long, thin wings\n\nand slender, lightweight bodies made large pterosaurs very aerodynamically\n\nefficient, able to soar on the weakest of rising air currents.\n Many of the largest pterosaurs may have been like today 's frigate\n\nbird: perhaps they soared hundreds of miles over the ocean, grabbing fish or\n\nharassing other pterosaurs to surrender their catches.\n Perhaps, also like the frigate bird, they were helpless if they\n\naccidentally landed on water.\n Smaller pterosaurs probably flew like sea gulls and petrels, needing\n\nto flap more often to keep themselves aloft.\n Other pterosaurs were aerial hunters like falcons.\n And the smallest ones were the swallows of their day, chasing insects\n\nand maneuvering to match their prey 's unpredictable flight.\n\n  Rayner and Hazelhurst 's work is just as interesting for what it\n\nsays pterosaurs didn't do as for what it says they did.\n Their long wings disqualified them from diving for fish like a duck\n\nor loon because they would have caused too much drag in the water.\n The researchers also say those long wings would have been unwieldy in\n\nforests.\n \" If you've got a 'ved living in trees or nesting in twigs, it has a\n\nreal problem if it 's got very long wings because they can knock against the\n\nenvironment,\" Rayner explains.\n\n  Rayner is the first to point out that the fossils may be skewing\n\nhis view.\n The fossils of small land animals are most often preserved in watery\n\nenvironments, such as oceans or lagoons, so creatures that kept to forests,\n\ndeserts, or plains left behind much sketchier traces.\n Rayner didn't consider many pterosaurs that have left only\n\nfragmentary remains.\n For example, paleontologists know the giant Quetzalcoatlus only from\n\nthe arm bones of a single animal.\n As a result, it 's still not clear exactly what its physical\n\nproportions were, and paleontologists suspect that its wings may actually\n\nhave been small for its body.\n Quetzalcoatlus is also unusual because it wasn't found by an ocean\n\nbut instead in what were once seasonal wetlands far inland in Texas.\n The biggest birds that live in these kinds of habitats today are\n\negrets and herons, which ( possibly like Quetzalcoatlus) have relatively\n\nsmall, squarish wings that let them keep clear of the trees and other plants\n\naround them.\n Imagine Quetzalcoatlus as a spectacularly oversize egret, wading\n\nsilently and delicately through the marsh, its long neck pulled back, and\n\nthen suddenly plunging its head into the water to snatch fish with its\n\nchopsticks-style jaws.\n\n  Other pterosaurs apparently foreshadowed birds' feeding habits in\n\nsurprising ways.\n One, named Pterodaustro, had hundreds of long bristlelike teeth in\n\nits lower jaw.\n Flamingos have similar ridges in their bill that they use to filter\n\nout algae and insects from water.\n Pterodaustro was exactly suited for that kind of feeding and\n\nsupremely unqualified for anything else.\n In London, Stafford Howse has been studying the jaw of a pterosaur he\n\nrefers to as the Purbeck spoonbill, after the geologic formation in England\n\nwhere it was found; like the living spoonbills of Africa and Asia, it had a\n\nlong, narrow beak ending in two horizontal disks.\n Spoonbills today move their beak through mud at the bottom of streams\n\nand lakes to stir up the animals they feed on.\n The Purbeck spoonbill seems to have been even better adapted to this\n\nkind of feeding because it had several dozen sturdy curved teeth on both\n\njaws.\n Although useless for chewing, since they jutted away from the mouth,\n\nthey would have been perfect as a mud rake.\n More over, part of the roof of the Purbeck spoonbill 's mouth was\n\nlined with horn; when it dug up snails and other shelled animals, it could\n\nhave broken them open like a nutcracker.\n\n  In 1991 it occurred to University of Miami ecologist Thomas\n\nFleming that some pterosaurs ought to have eaten fruit.\n Fruit-bearing plants now depend on bats, birds, and primates to eat\n\ntheir fruit and spread the seeds in their droppings.\n Yet paleobotanists believe that for 40 million years after\n\nfruit-bearing plants first appeared, these dispersers either hadn't yet\n\nevolved or were rare.\n There were plant-eating dinosaurs, of course, but they probably\n\ndestroyed the seeds in their enormous, slow-moving digestive systems.\n However, Fleming hypothesized, the seeds would probably have survived\n\na passage through a pterosaur 's small gut.\n Furthermore, it made sense that pterosaurs would have taken advantage\n\nof a food that could provide them with the energy they needed for flying.\n The only problem with Fleming 's idea was that at the time there\n\nweren't any pterosaurs known that might have been fruit eaters.\n\n  Fleming decided to publish his suggestion anyway, and only after\n\nhis paper had been typeset did Wellnhofer tell him about a pterosaur from\n\nAraripe that he and Kellner were beginning to describe; they had named it\n\nTapejara ( meaning \" the old being\" in the language of the Tupi Indians).\n This pterosaur had an eight-inch-long head dominated by a high, thin\n\nprow in front of its nose that tapered back to a narrow prong above the eye.\n Its toothless jaws were like a precise pair of tweezers, sharp and\n\nslightly bowed.\n\n  The combination of crest and beak rules out many of the usual\n\npterosaur feeding techniques.\n The fish eaters had either gripping teeth or long jaws like a\n\npelican 's.\n Tapejara 's beak might have been good for picking at carrion, but its\n\ncrest would have gotten in the way when it tried to poke into a carcass.\n Yet both its crest and its beak made Tapejara well suited for picking\n\nfruit.\n It could have used the crest to push aside thick foliage and could\n\nthen have plucked fruit from the stem with its beak, which is precisely what\n\nhornbills and toucans do today.\n If so, then perhaps pterosaurs like Tapejara were crucial to the\n\nevolution of fruits like avocados and mangoes.\n\n  FLYING AND EATING undoubtedly took up a healthy part of a\n\npterosaur 's day but not all of it.\n What did pterosaurs do the rest of the time?\n What was their social life like?\n Christopher Bennett has recently shed some light on the question for\n\na pterosaur known as Pteranodon, which lived from 115 million to 70 million\n\nyears ago along the coast of a sea that ran down the middle of North America.\n It was among the best of the soaring pterosaurs, with a wingspan\n\nranging from 10 to 25 feet.\n Pteranodon fossils have been found at sites that were 100 miles or\n\nmore from the coastline of the ancient sea, which suggests that these\n\npterosaurs regularly flew great distances in search of food.\n\n  Bennett compared some 1,100 Pteranodon fossils, plotting on a\n\ngraph the length of their individual leg bones, finger bones, and so on.\n In each case the measurements bunched into two distinct groups.\n The average individual in the small group, he calculated, had a\n\nwingspan of 12.5 feet, while the larger ones averaged 19 feet.\n The smaller pteranodons seemed to be more common, outnumbering the\n\nlarger creatures two to one.\n\n  Beyond their size--and presumably their weight--there were only\n\ntwo other differences Bennett could find between the groups: the pelvises of\n\nthe large animals were proportionately narrow, while those belonging to the\n\nsmaller ones were wide; the smaller animals also had small crests, while the\n\nlarge pteranodons had extravagant ones.\n\n  Paleontologists have long speculated on the purpose of pterosaur\n\ncrests.\n Did they improve the aerodynamics of the body?\n Did they act as a rudder?\n Kellner points out that Tupuxuara 's fossilized crest was covered with\n\nthe impressions of blood vessels.\n A dense mesh of capillaries on the crest, he proposes, might have\n\nacted like an air conditioner during flight, bringing hot blood close to the\n\nskin.\n\n  Bennett doesn't think either aerodynamics or cooling makes sense.\n If a small crest is sufficient to do the job, then why do a third of\n\nthe pteranodons have much bigger ones?\n The only explanation that made sense to him was that he was looking\n\nat male and female pteranodons.\n The crests were primarily male mating displays, like antlers on an\n\nelk or a long tail on a bird, and the wide hips of the smaller, female\n\npteranodons were designed to pass eggs.\n\n  To understand this combination of sexual differences in size,\n\ndisplays, and population ratios, Bennett turned to living animals as\n\nanalogues.\n He found several creatures with these traits, ranging from elephant\n\nseals to boat-tailed grackles.\n And, he learned, they all court, mate, and raise their young in a\n\nsimilar fashion.\n Bennett thinks Pteranodon probably did the same.\n He envisions male pteranodons on crowded rookeries lining the ocean,\n\ncompeting for the attention of females.\n Usually crest and body-size display would be enough for males to\n\nward off challengers, but occasionally they might have to fight.\n The winners would maintain big harems of the smaller females, but\n\nthey 'd offer no help in raising their young.\n\u00ef\u00ff", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ef756432-9709-45d3-b051-5511f51d658d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.923475+00:00"}
{"text": "The molecule was not alive, at least not in any conventional\n\nsense.\n Yet its behavior was astonishingly lifelike.\n When it appeared last April at the Scripps Research Institute in La\n\nJolla, California, scientists thought it had spoiled their experiment.\n But this snippet of synthetic RNA-- one of the master molecules in the\n\nnuclei of all cells--proved unusually talented.\n Within an hour of its formation, it had commandeered the organic\n\nmaterial in a thimble-size test tube and started to make copies of itself.\n Then the copies made copies.\n Before long, the copies began to evolve, developing the ability to\n\nperform new and unexpected chemical tricks.\n Surprised and excited, the scientists who witnessed the event found\n\nthemselves wondering, Is  this  how life got started? \n\n  It is a question that is being asked again and again as news of\n\nthis remarkable molecule and others like it spreads through the scientific\n\nworld.\n Never before have the creations of laboratories come so close to\n\ncrossing the threshold that separates living from nonliving, the quick from\n\nthe dead.\n It is as if the most fundamental questions about who we are and how\n\nwe got here are being distilled into threadlike entities smaller than specks\n\nof dust.\n In the flurry of research now underway--and the philosophical debate\n\nthat is certain to follow--scientists find themselves confronting anew one of\n\nearth 's most ancient mysteries.\n\n\n  Science 's answers to these questions are changing, and changing\n\nrapidly, as fresh evidence pours in from fields as disparate as oceanography\n\nand molecular biology, geochemistry and astronomy.\n This summer a startling, if still sketchy, synthesis of the new ideas\n\nemerged during a weeklong meeting of origin-of-life researchers in Barcelona,\n\nSpain.\n Life, it now appears, did not dawdle at the starting gate, but rushed\n\nforth at full gallop.\n UCLA paleobiologist J. William Schopf reported finding fossilized\n\nimprints of a thriving microbial community sandwiched between layers of rock\n\nthat is 3.5 billion years old.\n This, along with other evidence, shows that life was well established\n\nonly a billion years after the earth 's formation, a much faster evolution\n\nthan previously thought.\n Life did not arise under calm, benign conditions, as once assumed,\n\nbut under the hellish skies of a planet racked by volcanic eruptions and\n\nmenaced by comets and asteroids.\n In fact, the intruders from outer space may have delivered the raw\n\nmaterials necessary for life.\n So robust were the forces that gave rise to the first living\n\norganisms that it is entirely possible, many researchers believe, that life\n\nbegan not once but several times before it finally \" took\" and colonized the\n\nplanet. The notion that life arose quickly and easily has spurred\n\nscientists to attempt a truly presumptuous feat: they want to create\n\nlife--real life--in the lab.\n What they have in mind is not some monster like Frankenstein 's,\n\npieced together from body parts and jolted into consciousness by lightning\n\nbolts, but something more like the molecule in that thimble-size test tube at\n\nthe Scripps Research Institute.\n They want to turn the hands of time all the way back to the beginning\n\nand create an entity that approximates the first, most primitive living\n\nthing.\n This ancient ancestor, believes Gerald Joyce, whose laboratory came\n\nup with the Scripps molecule, may have been a simpler sturdier precursor of\n\nmodern RNA, which, along with the nucleic acid DNA, its chemical cousin,\n\ncarries the genetic code in all creatures great and small. Some\n\nsuch molecule, Joyce and other scientists believe, arose in the shadowy\n\ntwilight zone where the distinction between living and nonliving blurs and\n\nfinally disappears.\n The precise chemical wizardry that caused it to pass from one side to\n\nthe other remains unknown.\n But scientists around the world are feverishly trying to duplicate\n\nit.\n Eventually, possibly before the end of the century, Joyce predicts,\n\none or more of them will succeed in creating a \" living\" molecule.\n When they do, it will throw into sharp relief one of the most\n\nunsettling questions of all: Was life an improbable miracle that happened\n\nonly once?\n Or is it the result of a chemical process so common and inevitable\n\nthat life may be continually springing up throughout the universe?\n\nOf all the riddles that have stirred the human imagination, none has provoked\n\nmore lyrical speculation, more religious awe, more contentious debate.\n No other moment in time, aside from the Big Bang that began the\n\nuniverse, could be more central to the understanding of nature than the\n\ninstant that life began.\n \" Scientific\" theories on the subject are as old as civilization.\n The ancient Egyptians believed frogs and toads arose from silt\n\ndeposited by the flooding Nile.\n The Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that insects and worms were\n\nborn of dewdrops and slime, that mice were generated by dank soil and that\n\neels and fish sprang forth from sand, mud and putrefying algae.\n In the 19th century, electricity, magnetism and radiation were\n\nbelieved to have the ability to quicken nonliving matter. It took\n\nthe conceptual might of Charles Darwin to imagine a biologically plausible\n\nscenario for life 's emergence.\n In an oft quoted letter, written in 1871, Darwin suggested that life\n\narose in a \" warm little pond\" where a rich brew of organic chemicals, over\n\neons of time, might have given rise to the first simple organisms.\n For the next century, Darwin 's agreeable hypothesis, expanded upon by\n\nother theorists, dominated thinking on the subject.\n Researchers decided that the \" pond\" was really the ocean and began\n\ntrying to figure out where the building blocks of life could have come\n\nfrom.\n\n  In 1953 University of Chicago graduate student Stanley Miller\n\nprovided the first widely accepted experimental evidence.\n In a glass jar he created a comic-strip version of primitive earth.\n Water for the ocean.\n Methane, ammonia and hydrogen for the atmosphere.\n Sparks for lightning and other forms of electrical discharge.\n One week later he found in his jar a sticky goop of organic\n\nchemicals, including large quantities of amino acids, Lego blocks for the\n\nproteins that make up cells.\n Now\n\nthis textbook picture of how life originated, so familiar to college students\n\njust a generation ago, is under serious attack.\n New insights into planetary formation have made it increasingly\n\ndoubtful that clouds of methane and ammonia ever dominated the atmosphere of\n\nprimitive earth.\n And although Miller 's famous experiment produced the components of\n\nproteins, more and more researchers believe that a genetic master\n\nmolecule--probably RNA--arose before proteins did. Meanwhile, older\n\nand older fossils have all but proved that life did not evolve at the\n\nleisurely pace Darwin envisioned.\n Perhaps most intriguing of all, the discovery of organisms living in\n\noceanic hot springs has provided a Stygian alternative to Darwin 's peaceful\n\npicture.\n Life, says microbiologist Karl Stetter of the University of\n\nRegensburg in Germany, may not have formed in a nice, warm pond, but in \" a\n\nhot pressure cooker.\" If scientists have, by and large, tossed out\n\nthe old ideas, they have not yet reached a consensus on the new.\n The current version of the story of life is a complex tale with many\n\nsolid facts, many holes and no shortage of competing theories on how to fill\n\nin the missing pieces.\n\n\n  Some 4.5 billion years ago, the solar system took shape inside a\n\nchrysalis of gas and dust.\n Small objects formed first, then slammed into one another to create\n\nthe planets.\n Early on, the energy unleashed by these violent collisions turned the\n\nembryonic earth into a molten ball.\n For a billion years thereafter, the young planet 's gravitational\n\nfield attracted all sorts of celestial garbage.\n Icy comets screamed in from the outermost reaches of the solar\n\nsystem, while asteroids and meteorites spiraled down like megaton\n\nbombs. Some of these asteroids could have been the size of\n\npresent-day continents, says planetary scientist Christopher Chyba, a White\n\nHouse fellow, and the asteroids' impact would have generated sufficient heat\n\nto vaporize rock, boil the oceans and fling into the atmosphere a scalding\n\nshroud of steam.\n\n\nYet after a billion years, when the solar system was swept nearly clean and\n\nthe primordial bombardment ended, life was already flourishing.\n UCLA 's Schopf has identified the imprints of 11 different types of\n\nmicroorganisms in the 3.5 billion-year-old rocks of Western Australia.\n Many of the fossils closely resemble species of blue-green algae\n\nfound all over the world today.\n Still older rocks in Greenland hint of cellular life that may have\n\ncome into existence a few hundred million years earlier--perhaps 3.8 billion\n\nyears ago.\n\n  At that time, scientists believe, life-threatening asteroids were\n\nstill periodically pummeling the planet.\n Verne Oberbeck and colleagues at NASA Ames Research Center estimate\n\nthat the interval between major impacts could have been as short as 3 million\n\nto 6 million years--much too brief a time to give life a leisurely\n\nincubation.\n This means, says Oberbeck, that the chemistry needed to green the\n\nplanet must have been fast, and it must have been simple.\n That being the case, he asks, why wouldn't life have arisen more than\n\nonce? \n\n\n  Where could life have sprouted and still been relatively safe\n\nfrom all but the largest asteroids? For the answer, many researchers are\n\nlooking to strange, chimney-like structures found in the depths of oceans.\n These sit atop cracks in the ocean floor, known as hydrothermal\n\nvents, that lead to subterranean chambers of molten rock.\n The result is an underwater geyser: cold water plunges down through\n\nsome of the cracks, and hot water gushes out through others.\n Fifteen years ago, when scientists began using submarines to explore\n\nthese seemly hostile environments, they were startled to discover extensive\n\necosystem filled with strange organisms, including giant tube worms and blind\n\nshrimp.\n Even more interesting, according to analysis or their RNA, the\n\nsulfur-eating microorganisms that anchor the food chain around the vents are\n\nthe closest living link to the first creatures on earth.\n The only other life-forms that archaic are microbes living in surface\n\nsteam baths like Yellowstone 's Octopus Spring. Could these\n\noverheated spots have been the places where life on earth got started? This \"\n\nhot world\" hypothesis has won many converts.\n Norman Pace, a microbiologist at Indiana University, speculates that\n\nthe thin crust of primitive earth, as prone to cracking as an eggshell, would\n\nhave made hydrothermal vents far more common than they are today.\n Geochemist Everett Shock of Washington University calculates that at\n\nhigh temperatures organisms can get extra energy from nutrients.\n \" The hotter it is,\" says Shock, \" the easier life is.\"\n ( Up to a point.\n No one has yet found a microbe living in conditions hotter than\n\n235&degree;F.)\n\n  Still, the question remains: Did life originate in the vents, or\n\njust migrate there?\n The vents may not have been a cradle but an air-raid shelter for\n\norganisms that originated near the ocean surface, than drifted to the bottom.\n There, protected by thousands of feet of water, these lucky refugees\n\nmight have survived a series of extraterrestrial impacts that killed off\n\ntheir relatives near the sunlit surface.\n\n\n  Stanley Miller 's glass-jar experiment 40 years ago suggested that\n\nthe components of life were easily manufactured from gases in the atmosphere.\n The conditions he re-created in his laboratory faithfully reflected\n\nthe prevailing wisdom of the time, which held that the earth was formed by a\n\ngradual, almost gentle convergence of rock and flecks of dust under the\n\ninfluence of gravity.\n According to this model, the earth started out cold.\n Its deepest layers did not catch fire until much later, after the\n\ndecay of radioactive elements slowly turned up the thermostat in the core.\n Thus, heavy elements such as iron did not immediately melt and sink\n\nto the core, but remained close to the surface for hundreds of millions of\n\nyears. Why is this important?\n Because iron soaks up oxygen and prevents it from combining with\n\ncarbon to form carbon dioxide.\n Instead, the carbon, and also the nitrogen, spewed into the\n\natmosphere by ancient volcanoes would have been available to interact with\n\nhydrogen.\n The serendipitous result: formation of methane and ammonia, the gases\n\nthat made the Miller experiment go.\n\n  It was, says Chyba, \" a beautiful picture.\"\n Unfortunately, he adds, it is probably wrong.\n For the violent collisions now believed to have attended earth 's\n\nbirth would have melted the iron and sent it plummeting to the depths.\n As a result, the early atmosphere would have been composed largely of\n\ncarbon dioxide-and organic compounds cannot be so easily generated in the\n\npresence of CO2. Where, then, did the building blocks of life come\n\nfrom?\n Quite possibly, many scientists think, organic compounds were\n\ntransported to earth by the very comets, asteroids and meteorites that were\n\nmaking life so difficult.\n At the University of California at Davis, zoologist David Deamer has\n\nextracted from meteorites organic material that forms cell- like membranes.\n He has also isolated pale yellow pigments capable of absorbing energy\n\nfrom light--a precursor, Deamer believes, of chlorophyll, the green pigment\n\nused by modern plants.  \u00ef\u00ff", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e20c8900-59e2-4d06-b2e4-27e4a9cb2b82", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.924877+00:00"}
{"text": "In 1966, on the occasion of the centenary of Adolph Meyer 's birth,\n\nTheodore Lidz delivered the Meyer lecture, entitling it \" Adolf Meyer and the\n\nDevelopment of American Psychiatry\" ( 1).\n He concluded the published version of the paper by saying, \" In\n\ncommemorating him, we can do much for ourselves and for psychiatry by\n\nrecognizing and utilizing the heritage he left us.?\n Analogously, in 1980 John Neill reviewed Meyer 's contributions in a\n\npaper on \" Adolf Meyer and American Psychiatry Today\" ( 2).\n He stated, \" Meyer 's times were similar to ours in many ways.\n In a curious fashion our professional wheel has come full circle to\n\nwhere it was in 1900, and we are again in need of the Meyerian spirit, a\n\nholistic perspective.\n Acquainting ourselves with the wisdom in his legacy is an important\n\nfirst step on the journey forward.\u001d\n In the 1985 Adolf Meyer lecture, Michael Rutter ( 3) pointed out the\n\nrelevance of Meyer 's work to major current issues in psychiatry.\n His paper, entitled \" Meyerian Psychobiology Personality Development,\n\nand the Role of Life Experiences,\" clearly enunciated the fundamental\n\nimplications of the psychobiological concept.\n In this paper, I wish to follow my eminent predecessors but also to\n\ndelineate in my own way how a reexamination of these Meyerian concepts might\n\npoint the way toward the next turning point in American psychiatry.\n Indeed, I perceive subtle signs of the early phases around which the\n\nnext stage might coalesce, and I anticipate that by the beginning of the\n\ntwenty-first century, the developmental lines will be much clearer. \n\n  To be the Medical Director of APA is in itself a remarkable\n\nhonor, and I have consistently relished the opportunity to be part of the\n\nprofession 's adaptation to new forces from within and outside of its changing\n\nboundaries.\n Lidz stated that \" Adolf Meyer virtually identified himself with\n\npsychiatry\"(1), and I empathize with that position as long as it is\n\nunderstood that I have also maintained the differentiation. \n\n  Of late I have noted the tendency ( not yet a symptom) to\n\nreminisce and reflect about the broader sweep of events; indeed, I have been\n\na participant and observer in remarkable changes in our field.\n In this paper I wish to review some of these events with emphasis\n\nupon the post-World War II changes that have been part of my personal\n\nexperience.\n The scientific program of APA 's 1989 annual meeting is an excellent\n\nsymbol of our current status--quite different from the symbols and substance\n\nof the meetings of a quarter of a century ago.\n In this paper, I wish to highlight four turning points: 1) the rise\n\nof Meyerian psychobiology and its peak impact in the second quarter of the\n\ntwentieth century, 2) the dominance of divergent therapeutic ideologies,\n\nincluding the important impact of psychoanalysis in the post-World War 11\n\nyears, 3) the current surge of neuroscience and psychopharmacology along with\n\nempiricism and logical positivism, 4) a predicted reemergence of analogues of\n\nMeyerian psychobiology at the turn of the twenty-first century accompanied by\n\na) a new systematized psychobiology of coping, of adaptation, and of active\n\nefforts by persons to deal with multileveled stresses, b) an increased\n\nknowledge base in life course transactions converting the elaborate Meyerian\n\nhistory taking system to a more dynamic and relevant process, c) a trend\n\ntoward a new nosological system that will give life and greater utility to\n\nthe current axis IV and V systems (  DSM-III  and  DSM-\n\n ) and will deal more effectively with the boundaries between health and\n\ndisorder, d) with a, b, and c ( coping life history, and boundaries between\n\nhealth and illness) and accompanied by appropriate professional leadership,\n\nthe reemergence of a vital new clinical psychiatry, e) a more balanced\n\noverall approach using psychoanalytic, social psychiatric, and biological\n\nconcepts that have become clear enough to test empirically, and f) a more\n\nrational therapeutic system emphasizing new combinations and transactions\n\nbetween pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy--along with a new generation of\n\neducators experienced in these combinations. \n THE RISE OF MEYERIAN PSYCHOBIOLOGY AND ITS PEAK IMPACT IN THE\n\nSECOND QUARTER OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY \n\n  I entered psychiatry in the decade after World War ll.\n The winds of change had already altered the psychiatric landscape,\n\nand almost all of my clinical supervisors and teachers espoused the new \"\n\ndynamic psychiatry.\u001d\n The textbooks of psychiatry, however, were still dominated strongly\n\nby the prewar developments, and my introduction to Adolf Meyer was announced\n\nprimarily by written words rather than by clinical interactions and case\n\nconferences or personal contact.\n In retrospect, I understand that this was unfortunate because it was\n\nnot easy to grasp Meyer 's ideas from his written words alone.\n Henderson 4) said that \" Adolf Meyer had to surmount language\n\ndifficulties affecting his speech and his writing which made it far from easy\n\nto get his meaning and rendered his ideas more obscure than they really\n\nwere.\u001d\n Ebaugh ( 5) , commenting on the same subject, stated that \" It was\n\nfrequently difficult to grasp the full import of Dr. Meyer 's formulations.\n It was his tendency to be elliptical or to verbalize incomplete\n\nthoughts which meandered in the direction of his own special interest of the\n\nmoment.\n This may account, In part, for the fact that his theories are not\n\nfully recorded, or are, at best, inadequately understood.\u001d\n ( It is hoped that late twentieth-century technology will afford\n\nsubsequent generations an opportunity to learn ten words.)\n Over time, however, I have become increasingly knowledgeable about\n\nthe basic tenets of Meyer 's ideas and understand better what a pervasive\n\ninfluence he exerted.\n Even more important for me, I began to understand why his ideas were\n\nso important.\n It is hoped that others will find it rewarding to make their own\n\njudgments on this matter. \n\n  On several occasions, Meyer sketched his own perception of the\n\nhistorical phases of psychiatry in the United States ( 6).\n He tended to call the first phase \" the time of the Thirteen,\"\n\nhonoring the founders of APA.\n He then described the second phase as \" the preoccupation with the\n\nbrain ( a mere word with most) as the palpable issue in the disorder, when\n\nthe workers actually looked for new emphases and concrete methods having to\n\nregulate complex organismal wholes, and the rising of competition from\n\noutside after the Civil War.\n That prototypic Meyerian description, with all of its ambiguity, lies\n\nat the heart of his concerns, namely, that the biological reductionism in the\n\nlate nineteenth century was, at least in part, a defensive maneuver against\n\nthe influx of immigrants into the United States.\n The \" moral psychiatry\" of the earlier part of the nineteenth century\n\nwas fine with Yankee patients and doctors but somehow less appropriate with\n\npostindustrial America.\n In characterizing a third phase of American psychiatry from the 1890s\n\nto World War 1, Meyer essentially described a period of increased\n\nsystematization of research, followed by a fourth phase that was a\n\ndescription of some of his hopes and aspirations.\n Meyer highlighted the development of special psychiatric centers (\n\nresearch oriented institutes) that could be models for an advancing science\n\nof psychiatry.\n His thoughts about psychosomatic processes and psychiatry 's role in\n\nmedicine were enunciated with emphasis upon \" the person\" and strong\n\ncriticism of dualism and reductionism. \n\n  From the late twentieth century vantage point, the nuances of\n\nchanges in the first part of this century are overshadowed by a dominant\n\ntrend symbolized by Meyer himself.\n Indeed, the turning point that peaked in the second quarter of this\n\ncentury can be characterized as a gradual shift from the prior biological\n\nreductionism and its attendant practices and value systems to a phase where\n\nclinical psychiatry took on new aspirations, new methods, and new interests.\n While Meyer characterized his major approach as psychobiology, his\n\npersonal style reflected the biopsychosocial model as enunciated much later\n\nby Engel ( 7).\n When finally ensconced in his pivotal professorship at Johns Hopkins\n\n( Phipps Clinic), Meyer maintained a profound interest in clinical practice,\n\ncarried out experimental procedures in the anatomical laboratories adjacent\n\nto his office, became the preeminent educator of the psychiatric leaders of\n\nthe next generation, and continuously served as an ardent advocate of\n\ncommunity programs.\n Simultaneously, he collaborated with leaders in other clinical\n\ndepartments to develop psychosomatic programs ( including liaison activities)\n\nand also kept abreast of larger philosophic, social, and political events.\n Keeping abreast was not an extraneous abstraction but involved\n\nfriendship and collaboration with an impressive array of scholars,\n\npoliticians, and moral philosophers. \n\n  It is likely, of course, that American psychiatry would have\n\nchanged direction even without Meyer, but its contour and evolution were\n\ndeeply influenced by him.\n It took a very special leader, however, to effect a turning of\n\npsychiatry toward a new direction.\n His solid biological roots gave special credence to his emphasis upon\n\nthe patient as a person; simultaneously, his interest in social and community\n\nphenomena could not be brushed away as irrelevant abstractions.\n Kraepelin and his American counterparts had been challenged by a\n\nworthy critic who shook the lugubrious roots of the concept of dementia\n\npraecox.\n S. Wei Mitchell 's 1894 challenge ( 8) to psychiatry to solidify its\n\nscientific and medical foundations was being answered by a leader with\n\nimpeccable medical and scientific credentials.\n A mood of hope and of increasing capacity to cope with the enormous\n\nproblems began to spread through the new scientific and academic institutes\n\ncreated by Meyer and his students.\n Many of these students became the directors and chairs of the major\n\npsychiatric departments across the country and also overseas.\n As they began to confront the many issues, however, progress was not\n\neasy.\n Hundreds of thousands of patients were housed in deteriorating\n\ninstitutions; treatment techniques and methods were unspecific; and the\n\nnumber of trained practitioners was much too small for the demands upon them.\n Just as the first rays of light began to seep through the end of the\n\ntunnel, World War 11 occurred and American psychiatry became absorbed in a\n\nmomentous maelstrom that challenged many fundamental tenets. \n THE DOMINANCE OF DIVERGENT THERAPEUTIC IDEOLOGIES INCLUDING THE\n\nIMPORTANT IMPACT OF PSYCHOANALYSIS IN THE POST-WORLD WAR 11 YEARS \n\n  World War II produced massive upheavals beyond the preemptive\n\npolitical and military events that changed the future course of history.\n In the wake of larger changes, old boundaries and barriers between\n\nnations became more permeable so that both people and ideas moved from one\n\npart of the world to another.\n The movement included the emigration of brilliant psychoanalysts to\n\nWestern Europe, the United States, and Canada. \n\n  For American psychiatry these events precipitated significant\n\nqualitative changes that have been well documented in many excellent\n\npublications.\n In this paper I wish to emphasize a few aspects of these changes,\n\nwhich, at least m part, have not been emphasized enough. \n\n  The large number of American psychiatric casualties among our\n\ntroops had riveted public attention to what began to be understood as a\n\nserious national problem.\n Wide publicity about new techniques to deal with traumatic neuroses,\n\nas developed by an able cadre of military psychiatrists, also had a\n\nsignificant impact.\n ( I was fortunate enough to work for many years with Roy Grinker [ 9]\n\nand learned much about those heady days. ) \n\n  What I wish to emphasize in this paper is that all of these\n\npostwar changes were engrafted upon the predisposing tendencies engendered\n\nduring the Meyerian turning point.\n The uncompleted psychobiological revolution had opened new\n\npossibilities to concentrate upon the person and upon the individual clinical\n\ncase.\n Biological psychiatry had not met the earlier challenges fully and\n\ngradually began to feel isolated.\n The dawn of a more concentrated effort at social and community\n\npsychiatry had been encouraged by Meyer himself.\n Most Important, Meyer had directly and indirectly supported the\n\ndevelopment of psychoanalysis in the United States; but by the early 1950s\n\npsychoanalysis superseded psychobiology and in fact paid only cursory\n\nattention to it. \n\n  In some quarters ( Sargant [ 10] in the United Kingdom, among\n\nothers) it was believed that psychoanalysis had taken over United States\n\npsychiatry lock, stock, and barrel.\n This perception was incorrect because, in fact, it overlooked\n\ncompeting ideologies ( e.g., in social and biological psychiatry) that\n\nfrequently challenged psychoanalysis, adding to the siege mentality that\n\nconsistently pervaded the field.\n Nevertheless, psychoanalysis developed enormous academic\n\ninstitutional power and affected significant hospitals, associations, and\n\ntheir leaders.\n Equally, perhaps even more important, ideas and practices throughout\n\nthe field were profoundly influenced.\n Repeatedly, I have emphasized one change that is only beginning to be\n\nunderstood by decision makers.\n Psychoanalysis altered the boundaries of psychiatry radically in\n\nterms of its implicit definition of psychopathology and its implicit concepts\n\nof what psychiatrists should do and should not do.\n ( 11), in the\n\ncontext of his brilliantly written clinical examples and structural concepts,\n\nled to an assumption of the near universality of psychopathology.\n When psychoanalytic theory was coupled with equally profound changes\n\nin child and adolescent psychiatry, the world of nosology was given a\n\nnear-mortal wound.", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a5bddfe2-316f-470c-9796-5a784cd377cc", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.926274+00:00"}

Government\n\nmaterial.\n\n \n\n  The 1976 Copyright Act attempted to ameliorate the strict\n\nconsequences of failure to include notice under prior law.\n It contained provisions that set out specific corrective steps to\n\ncure omissions or certain errors in notice.\n Under these provisions, an applicant had 5 years after publication to\n\ncure omission of notice or certain errors.\n Although these provisions are technically still in the law, their\n\nimpact has been limited by the amendment making notice optional for all works\n\npublished on and after March 1, 1989.\n\n\n\n\n\n  A work that is created ( fixed in tangible form for the first\n\ntime) on or after January 1, 1978, is automatically protected from the moment\n\nof its creation and is ordinarily given a term enduring for the author 's life\n\nplus an additional 70 years after the author 's death.\n In the case of \" a joint work prepared by two or more authors who did\n\nnot work for hire,\" the term lasts for 70 years after the last surviving\n\nauthor 's death.\n For works made for hire, and for anonymous and pseudonymous works (\n\nunless the author 's identity is revealed in Copyright Office records), the\n\nduration of copyright will be 95 years from publication or 120 years from\n\ncreation, whichever is shorter.\n Works Originally Created and Published or Registered Before\n\nJanuary 1, 1978", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a1ce2c46-cd0e-4c3f-89ba-35cc08cec04d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.927577+00:00"}
{"text": "Thank you again for offering to help me with this project for Dr.\n\nMeyer.\n I know you're busy - - are 're we all? - - and it 's difficult to find\n\nsomeone who is willing to take the time to write, which is somewhat of a lost\n\nart form.\n I enjoy writing, and I wish I had more opportunities to do so.\n I especially enjoy corresponding with people through letters while\n\ntraveling or living abroad.\n Call me old school, but I think it 's terrific to send and receive\n\nletters that travel great distances.\n It 's fun to imagine the route a particular letter had to take to get\n\nto a friend or family member.\n I also like to receive letters that have postage and post marks from\n\ncountries around the world.\n I'm not a stamp collect 'm, but I have always saved the envelopes that\n\nI've received fr 'veoutside the United States.\n\n\n Well, I'm back in the swing 'm things at school.\n This is my fourth full-time, and last, semester in the program.\n After I finish this term, I will only have one class and my full-time\n\nstudent teaching work that takes a semester to complete.\n If my current plans holds, I will take and pass the ESL test in May\n\nthat is required by the state of Massachusetts for a teaching license in the\n\nfield of English as a Second Language.\n This test, along with the literacy test that I took and passed last\n\nyear, will then allow me to apply to the Massachusetts Department of\n\nEducation ( MDOE) for a provisional state teaching license.\n In the summer I will then be in a position to apply for teaching\n\nposition in ESL or the fall.\n So, I will be getting paid to complete my student teaching\n\nrequirement for my department rather than paying my school for the experience\n\nof working somewhere for nothing.\n Additionally, I will complete the final class, Psycholinguistics, in\n\nthe evening.\n It will be a busy and stressful time, holding my first formal\n\nteaching position in an American school while taking on of the more\n\nchallenging classes in the program, but I will get it done.\n Then, at the end of December, I will take the comprehensive ( \"\n\ncomps\") exam, an exit exam that everyone must pass in order to complete the\n\nprogram and receive their masters degree.\n There is a lot of stress and anxiety among students in my program\n\nregarding the comp exam, which is understandable.\n Students have only two chances to pass the exam.\n If they fail both attempts they can't graduate and receive their\n\ndegree.\n However, most people pass the test on the first attempt.\n Indeed, the program is structure so that diligent students who work\n\nhad throughout their studies, as I have been doing, will pass the comp exam.\n\n\n\n\n Although I'm too busy to seriou 'my entertain this notion now, it has\n\noccurred to me in recent months that what will I do once I complete the\n\nprogram this December.\n My intention, as I stated, is to get my full teacher license to work\n\nas a K-6 ESL teacher in the state of Massachusetts.\n I don't know where in the state I will work, but I would like to\n\nremain within an easy commute of my apartment.\n This means I will either work somewhere in greater Boston or\n\nCambridge.\n I like Cambridge - - if you recall, I stayed in Cambridge the first\n\nsix weeks I lived in Boston - - and it has a strong reputation for providing\n\nquality schools for ESL/Bilingual students.\n So, I think it would be a good fit for me.\n Another option would be to apply for a teaching fellowship through\n\nthe Fullbright foundation.\n I would apply for the fellowship, which is called an English Teaching\n\nAssistant ( ETA), this summer, I think, and I would be sent overseas next\n\nyear, possibly the spring.\n The ETA fellowship would place me in a classroom to work as a\n\nco-teacher or assistant to a local K-6 teacher.\n It would be a great experience, and professional opportunity for me\n\nto receive this job.\n It 's highly competitive, so I'm not counting on i 'm\n Nonetheless, having the Fullbright foundation on my resume would be a\n\ntremendous asset.\n Additionally, I would get the formal teaching experience in a\n\nclassroom that my resume needs.\n Plus I would get to satisfy my wanderlust that seems to pop up every\n\nfew years. \n\n\n Most of the ETA positions that don't require second language fluency,\n\nthus the ones I would apply to, are in Eastern Europe and South East Asia.\n Given that I just spent 15 months in South East Asia about three and\n\na half years ago, and that it 's been almost ten years since my travels in\n\nEurope, I will probably pick Europe.\n Moreover, when I was in Europe I never visited the eastern part.\n Plus I still have a lot of friends in Europe, mostly in Ireland, so\n\nit would be great to be closer to people who I haven't seen in ages.\n\nUnfortunately, I can only pick one country on my application, and at this\n\ntime I don't have a clear favorite.\n I will work closely with my advisor on selecting the appropriate\n\nchoice, but I'll be 'llppy in most countries I think. \n\n\n If I don't get the ETA position, I will continue to live in the greater\n\nBoston area and see how my opportunities unfold once I leave my department.\n I have thought seriously about applying for a position with the\n\nInternational Schools Services, ISS, in a few years.\n International Schools are the best jobs available to teachers\n\noverseas.\n The pay is good, the quality of life is high, opportunities to travel\n\nare great, and so on.\n In order to be eligible to work for the ISS I need to have a masters\n\ndegree and two years formal teaching experience in the United States holding\n\na state teaching license, so this plan I can put on hold for a little while.\n\n\n\n\n I don't know if I want to be a teacher for the rest of my life, but I do\n\nwant to stay iin the field of education in some capacity, particularly in a\n\ncapacity that affords me the opportunity to live and work abroad from time to\n\ntime.\n Through my graduate studies I've been exp 'ved to a number of fields\n\nwithin education - - testing, special education, policy, etc. but I haven't\n\nfound one that I've really c 'veected with.\n I think I might like administration, particularly for the chance to\n\ncreate a program that I know will work well for students.\n That idea is, obviously, many years in the making.\n Whatever speciality I choose, getting at least a few years of\n\nclassroom teaching under my belt is essential.\n I can't imagine devoting my life to education and not know what it 's\n\nlike working in the public/private school system.\n Working as a teacher will give me an indespensible knowledge base\n\nthat will sever me well my entire career. \n\n\n The weather has been unusually, and strangely, warm lately, almost spring\n\nlike.\n It feels good, of course, but I expect it to get very cold again\n\nsoon.\n We're also 're for another dump of heavy snow fall.\n As we know, the weather in San Francisco can be unpredictable, but\n\nI've never 'vewn weather such as the weather out here.\n I truly understand what an inclement climate means now that I've\n\nliv 'vein Boston for a year and half ( roughly).\n\n\n I still find the first snowfall breathtaking, and I remember staring in\n\nawe at the sheets of water that come down, along with the thunder and\n\nlightning storms, during the summer months.\n In California rain is a rare sight between March and November,\n\nespecially in Southern California.\n One thing is for sure: it 's hard to imagine New England, between snow\n\nfall and year round rain fall, will ever enter into a drought period. \n\n I had a crazy thought lately.\n When I finish my studies, and I settle into a job, I want to buy a\n\nmotorcycle.\n I think I told you I had a motorbike in Thailand that I used almost\n\ndaily.\n Granted it was a small bike, a four stroke 150, but it gave me\n\nconfidence to ride a larger bike at some point.\n I think a 450 would be a perfect size bike for me.\n I would take formal bike driving lessons, and I would only use it on\n\nthe weekends and for seasonal road trips.\n In other words, I would still use my car as my primary source of\n\ntransportation.\n I know motorcycles can be dangerous, but I will train to be a skilled\n\nrider, and I won't use it recklessly.\n\n\n There is so much beautiful country side to explore in New England that\n\nhaving a motorbike to take road trips on would be incredible.\n In fact, I would say that one of the things I enjoy most about living\n\nin Boston is that, like San Francisco, there is easy and tremendous access to\n\nbeautiful open spaces a short ride outside the city center.\n I've been 'vee to see a fair bit of Massachusetts since I arrived,\n\nand a little bit of Rhode Island too, but there 's still a lot I want to see.\n I would love, for starters, to take a road trip through the Green\n\nMountains of Vermont or the upper coast of line of Maine.\n\n\n\n Well, I've cove 've a lot of ground in this letter, but I'm proba 'my still\n\na few hundred words short of a 2000 word sample for my professors' project.\n Therefore, I'll 'llnish the remaining two or three pages in my\n\nresponse to your letter. \n\n I hope you and Melissa have a great vacation this month.\n Enjoy my letter, and I look forward to receiving yours, hopefully in\n\na few weeks. \n\n\n All the best, John, Quincy, MA\n\n\n\n\n I hope this letter finds you and Melissa doing well.\n I have a lot on my mind these days as I prepare for my new job to\n\nstart after Labor Day weekend.\n It 's my first full-time licensed teaching position!\n I'l 'lle working as an elementary school teacher at the McKay school\n\nin East Boston.\n It 's unclear what grades I' 'llbe teaching because McKay doesn't have\n\ntheir final fall enrollment figures yet.\n However, it will be grades one, two, or three.\n I strongly prefer to have my own classroom, but that also is unclear.\n I might be a \" pull out\" teacher, which means I work with groups of\n\nstudents who are strongly in need of special English language services.\n Although they'r 'reimits pedagogically to what a teacher can\n\naccomplish in such a classroom, it 's not a bad position to start.\n After all, I' 'ma new teacher entering the field at a time of great\n\neconomic downturn and uncertainty.\n Indeed, hundreds of teachers will be \" let go\" this year in the\n\nBoston Public Schools, a common, and troubling reality being played out\n\nacross the country.\n In other words, I should simply be thankful to have any teaching\n\nposition -

{"text": "The circuits of capital/uneven development model is widely\n\nused in geography, urban planning, and the social sciences.\n Its principal weakness is its marginalizing of local influences in\n\nexplaining the intensity and patterning of metropolitan investment.\n A deeper consideration of local culture, politics, and biographies is\n\nneeded to sensitize the model to the particularities of place.\n Local creative actors set in motion place-specific forms of change\n\nwhose logic is tied to structured circumstances.  \n\n  Studies of North American urban structure increasingly incorporate\n\nthe insights of neostructuralist theory to dissect gentrification, slum\n\nformation, downtown restructuring, and similar urban processes.\n Whereas ecological and neoclassical studies cast districts as\n\nessentially outgrowths of metropolitan forces, neostructuralist studies\n\nemphasize the influence of regional, national, and global economic processes\n\n( Smith and Feagin 1987; Cater and Jones 1989).\n They seek to connect broad economic transformation with local urban\n\nchange, recognizing that human agents and large-scale processes restructure\n\nplaces.\n Local agents are frequently seen as translators of broad processes,\n\nwho transmit the influence of structures to neighborhood or city. \n\n  The circuits of capital/uneven development model emphasizes the\n\nlocal transformative influence of a crisis-driven national economy ( Harvey\n\n1981, 1982).\n It connects local urban change with the capital accumulation process.\n In this model, investment shifting across economic circuits together\n\nwith the logic of local uneven development explain the intensity and\n\ndistribution of local restructuring.\n Investment shifting across economic circuits involves three\n\ninterrelated capital outlets: the primary(investment in production),\n\nsecondary ( investment in built environment and consumption fund), and\n\ntertiary ( investment in technology and labor power reproduction).\n Investment shifts initially concentrate in production.\n A tendency to channel too much investment into primary production\n\narises as investors act in a way that, in aggregate, runs counter to their\n\nown class interest.\n Bouts of overaccumulating capital ( and underinvestment in the built\n\nenvironment) then facilitate capital shifting to the secondary circuit.\n Investors subsequently generate crisis in this circuit by\n\nconcentrating capital in the built environment that overaccumulates and\n\nproduces falling profits.This crisis is evinced by periods of excess\n\nresidential and commercial construction, rising building vacancies, and\n\ndeclining real estate prices.\n Investment again needs to be withdrawn, this time out of the built\n\nenvironment, and guided elsewhere to elude declining profits.\n Such investment switching is chronic and permits investors to stay\n\none step ahead of falling profits. \n\n  The second part of the circuits of capital model, the logic of\n\nlocal uneven development, explains investment patterns by reference to\n\ndifferential opportunities for capturing potential profit from redevelopment\n\nacross space.\n Investment accumulates where potential property value is not captured\n\nunder present use, usually where substandard buildings and property\n\npredominate.\n Areas are seen to undergo progressive disinvestment that creates a\n\ngap between potential and actual land rent being extracted.\n When this gap is most pronounced, investment flows back to the area\n\nto close the rent gap.\n Devaluation therefore sets the stage for profitable investment.\n Metropolitan change becomes spatially uneven, profit-driven and\n\npronounced in areas where property value potential is currently unfulfilled.\n\n\n\n  I examine the current status of the circuits of capital/uneven\n\ndevelopment model in light of its increased use in geography, urban planning,\n\nand the social sciences ( see Jackson 1984; Leitner 1987).\n I identify its weaknesses and propose a revised formulation for more\n\nsophisticated usage.\n My goal is to offer a model that is more sensitive to the particular\n\ncircumstances of specific places.\n Empirical applications of this model subsume the importance of the\n\nlocal to the general and exhibit two major flaws.\n First, they marginalize the role of locally constructed investment\n\nincentives as forces attracting capital.\n Overemphasis on the built environment as a safety valve for\n\ninvestment conceals the influence of constructed investment incentives.\n Second, they neglect the role of local culture, politics, and\n\nindividuals in structuring uneven development.\n The model casts the process as something that happens to people\n\nrather than something they influence.\n The filter of local process, I believe, ceaselessly meshes with\n\nbroader economic processes to generate uneven investment. \n\n  My proposal for refining this model calls for a deeper\n\nconsideration of local culture, politics, and actors in explaining the\n\nintensity and patterning of metropolitan investment.\n The granting of significant causal power to the rich texture of place\n\nadds breadth to the model.\n This element is important with recognition that intensities and\n\npatterns of restructuring vary widely across metropolitan areas.\n My revision retains the historical-materialist character of the model\n\nwhile sharpening its grasp of local conditions.\n Culture, politics, and individuals should be crucial components in\n\nany materialist model that purports to explain local restructuring. \n\n\n  Recent applications of the circuits of capital model are\n\nsuggestive but they frequently lack detail and specificity.\n Four studies have attracted disproportionate attention amidst a surge\n\nof applications ( see Clark 1988; Badcock 1989; Beauregard 1991).\n Harvey 's ( 1981) historical analysis of US urbanism, the first\n\napplication of this model, linked recent urban growth to national and\n\ninternational economic processes.\n Harvey cast the ebb and flow of real estate investment as outcomes of\n\noveraccumulating capital in the primary circuit that necessitated capital\n\nrechanneling.\n Too much capital initially was produced in the primary circuit in\n\naggregate for its profitable employment.\n Capital switching, to Harvey, represented efforts to find productive\n\noutlets for capital.\n The global economic crises of the 1930s and 1970s represented most\n\nvivid illustrations of this switching.\n Uneven urban development that followed was theorized as a see-saw\n\ninvestment pattern driven by the rhythms of capital accumulation.\n Devaluation of fixed capital set the stage for renewed investment\n\nthat blunted falling rates of profit in production. \n\n  Harvey ( 1985) expanded this argument in a more sophisticated\n\nstudy of Paris, with its massive building programs under Louis Napolean and\n\nBaron Haussrnann Economic crisis, once again, took the form of overproduction\n\nthat spurred massive construction in the 1850s and 1860s.\n Government and banks were used to resolve this crisis; intervention\n\neased capital switching from primary to secondary circuits.\n This intervention temporarily resolved one crisis only to generate\n\nanother.\n Deficit financing of new construction represented a new investment\n\noutlet but created an overstretched financial structure doomed to crash. \n\n  Harvey 's study of Paris traced how the large-scale and local\n\ninterconnected to produce unique local restructuring.\n Uneven investment across Paris was guided by active agents infused\n\nwith a materialist imperative.\n A logic of accumulation was negotiated by personal biographies that\n\nascribed meaning and symbolism to the restructuring process.\n A central figure in this process was Baron Haussman, who helped\n\nconstruct a built environment that permitted excess capital to circulate and\n\nbe absorbed in the everyday fabric.\n He mobilized public works projects that transformed Paris to his\n\npersonalized specifications.\n Eased flows between center and periphery, left and right banks, and\n\nindustrial and commercial spaces opened up new investment opportunities and\n\nrenewed livability.\n This restructuring had a unique and distinctive form whose logic was\n\ncompelled by circumstances of economic crisis.\n The \" force he [ Haussman] had to mobilize, and it was in the end the\n\nforce that mastered him, was the circulation of capital.\n The surpluses of capital and labor power absolutely had to be\n\nabsorbed if the Empire was to survive\" ( Harvey 1985, 76). \n\n  Following the lead of Harvey, Feagin ( 1985) examined office\n\nbuilding investment in Houston, Texas.\n Municipal mediation of investment flows across circuits constituted\n\nFeagin 's focus.\n Municipal government catalyzed office construction through weak\n\ninvestment regulation, technical assistance, and absence of zoning.\n At the same time, the city provided construction subsidies in the\n\nform of tax abatements, reduced land prices, and block grants.\n The resulting boom in construction attracted jobs and capital\n\nbelieved critical to economic viability.\n Government rhetoric extolling the virtues of unfettered growth\n\naccompanied these programs.\n Such investment was not profitable forever, however.\n Unregulated investment generated periods of overbuilding, as shown in\n\ncycles of rising vacancy rates and falling profits.\n Slowed construction and leasing concessions reflected the downside of\n\nunregulated urban investment.\n While failing to bring out the complete influence of local processes,\n\nFeagin convincingly documented the transient ability of the secondary circuit\n\nto absorb capital profitably.\n Investment in this circuit, like others, represented a short-term\n\nsolution to recurring crises of falling profits. \n\n  King ( 1989a, 1989b, l989c) applied the circuits of capital model\n\nto the Melbourne, Australia housing market between 1932 and 1985.\n He more substantively linked urban restructuring to microscale\n\nprocesses.\n In particular, the importance of constructed housing submarkets as\n\nlocal investment influences was introduced.\n This process was purportedly most pronounced during periods of\n\ncapital overaccumulation in the primary circuit and subsequent economic\n\ndownturn.\n Thus, capital switching to the secondary circuit was facilitated by\n\ntwo forces.\n The first, the initial tendency for investors to ignore the secondary\n\ncircuit with a robust primary circuit, subsequently made real estate\n\ninvestment logical with falling profits in production.\n The second, the tendency for municipalities to build networks of\n\nhousing submarkets, ensured profitable real estate investment within socially\n\nconstructed islands.\n Social and economic processes were interwoven to depict a secondary\n\ncapital circuit that was stimulated by social constructions.\n Uneven metropolitan restructuring that followed was reflected in\n\npockets of intensive reinvestment amidst broader stagnation and decline. \n\n  King 's ( 1989a, 1989b, 1989c) sophisticated conceptualization did\n\nnot consider the full range of local influences.\n For example, he did not fully address local government incentives and\n\nobstructions to the production of submarkets nor the facilitative and\n\nidiosyncratic influence of key managers.\n Thus, the influence of locality-specific regulations like historic\n\ndistrict designation, zoning, and tax abatement for upgrading properties were\n\nignored.\n These programs, moreover, were ostensibly controversial in granting\n\nbenefits to select populations and got mediated in unique and distinctive\n\nways by political operatives.\n Finally, the restructuring influence of community mores and standards\n\nwere subsumed under economic imperatives.\n Issues like local tolerance for segregation attempts to combat\n\nresidential discrimination, and cultural alliances among groups that could\n\nweaken or strengthen existing submarkets remained unaddressed.\n A superficial notion of locality was thus brought to bear on the\n\nrestructuring process. \n\n  Such studies shed a wealth of insight on contemporary\n\nmetropolitan change.\n They fail, however, to fully integrate the importance of local\n\nprocesses.\n Metropolitan areas frequently emerge as \" ideal types,\" exhibiting\n\nlittle richness and substance to influence investment intensity and\n\ndistribution.\n Set against the powerful structural logic of capital shifting across\n\neconomic circuits and its inexorable uneven patterning, the local only mildly\n\nmediates.\n Some local contingency and variability is recognized, but set against\n\nthe broader rhythms of capital accumulation, the local follows and adheres\n\nrather than structures and shapes.\n The following discussion illustrates the need to develop theory to\n\naccount for local influences.\n It documents the need to consider metropolitan areas as human\n\nconstructions differentially facilitative of investment.\n It also documents local influences on uneven development.\n I focus on four US cities to demonstrate these points: New York City,\n\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore, and Indianapolis.\n These cities, different in morphology, permit the impact of local\n\nprocesses to be suitably documented. \n\n\n  Circuits of capital/uneven development studies view metropolitan\n\ninvestment as essentially a final effort to avoid broader economic crisis.\n Investment purportedly flees the primary circuit and settles in the\n\nbuilt environment as an emergency outlet.\n The built environment. as a separate capital circuit, replenishes\n\ninvestor profit margins.\n Thus, Harvey ( 1981, 111) depicted eighteenth century Britain as\n\nengulfed by a capital glut that \" had nowhere else to go.\"\n The built environment appears as a godsend for the absorption of\n\nsurplus, overaccumulated capital\" ( Harvey 1982,236).\n Feagin ( 1985,190) depicted contemporary Houston as \" a major place\n\nfor the investment of surplus capital a major outlet for overaccumulation of\n\ncapital in the primary circuit.\"\n King ( 1989b, 711-38) described Melbourne as an outgrowth of \"\n\ncrises of overaccumulation speculative money capital itself prone to\n\noveraccumulation.\" \n\n  Such interpretations minimize local investment incentives that\n\nshape local restructuring intensity.\n Yet built environments are not passive capital outlets, but dynamic\n\nand evolving infrastructures differing in capacity to absorb profitable\n\ninvestment.\n Incentives for construction, often contested in their planning and\n\nemergence, arise unevenly across places.\n While agents like builders, developers, realtors, and local\n\ngovernments seek to implement incentives conducive to investment, tenant\n\ngroups, block clubs, and neighborhood associations work to create a livable\n\nand humane urban area.\n The complex interplay between these groups structures investment\n\nattractiveness.\n To attract massive investment, various agents promote two processes,\n\nsocioeconomic differentiation and subsidized tax base redevelopment.\n These actors are place entrepreneurs who strive for maximum\n\nfinancial return through investing, renting, or taxing property.\n They implicitly reject the notion that noneconomic factors should\n\nguide community development.\n Conflict over development in the political sphere defines the degree\n\nto which they can achieve their agendas.\n While these actors do not necessarily conspire to create\n\nsocioeconomic differentiation and subsidized tax base redevelopment, the\n\nshort term pursuit of profit and political support often create them.\n Successfully implanting these processes makes a built environment\n\nattractive for massive investment.", "subdomain":

Statistics: If it is not\n\nconvenient to complete a Voluntary Acknowledgment of Parentage form in the\n\ncommunity where the child was born, the parents may complete the form at the\n\nRegistry of Vital Records and Statistics ( RVRS), or mail the form with a\n\ncheck for\n\n&dollar;25 to RVRS. \n\n  Parents can acknowledge paternity for their child any time in the\n\nchild 's life. \n\n\n\n  Legal fatherhood for the child is established as of the date both\n\nparents sign the acknowledgment form, if it is properly completed and\n\nfiled.\n\n  If, within 60 days of the date both parents signed, either parent\n\ncomes to believe that the man named on the form may not be the father, one of\n\nthe parents must file a case in Probate and Family Court and ask the court to \"\n\nrescind\" the acknowledgment ( that is, have it declared null and void). \n\n  If, within 60 days of signing, the parent questioning paternity\n\nis a party to a court hearing about the child ( for instance, to establish a\n\nchild support order or a custody and visitation order), the parent must raise\n\nthe issue of the child 's paternity at the hearing.\n Before the end of the 60 day period, the parent questioning paternity\n\nmust file a case in Probate and Family Court asking to rescind the\n\nacknowledgment. \n\n  After 60 days, the acknowledgment is as binding as a court\n\njudgment of paternity and has the same legal force and effect.\n However, parents can challenge the acknowledgment, but only in court,\n\nonly within one year of the date both parents sign, and only on limited\n\ngrounds of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact. \n\n  The court will generally order the parents and child to undergo\n\npaternity tests that determine whether the man is the biological father of\n\nthe child by comparing certain genetic characteristics that show up in blood\n\nor tissue samples from the child and both parents.\n These samples are obtained either by a simple blood draw or by\n\nrubbing a cotton swab on the inside of the cheek. \n\n  If there are any questions about who a child 's biological father\n\nreally is, a parent should ask a judge or the Child Support Enforcement\n\nDivision of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue for paternity tests\n\nbefore signing an acknowledgment form. \n\n Going To Court To Establish Paternity: A More Complicated Way To\n\nEstablish Paternity For Your Child\n\n  Another way to establish paternity is for either parent, their\n\nchild, or us - the Child Support Enforcement Division - to start a court\n\naction to establish paternity.\n\n  As part of this court action, the judge may order the mother, the\n\nman who may be the father, and the child to have paternity tests.\n These tests are generally quick and easy.\n After reviewing the test results and any other relevant information,\n\nthe judge will decide whether or not the man is the father of the child.\n If the judge determines that he is the child 's biological father,\n\nthis will establish paternity for the child and the father 's name will go on\n\nthe child 's birth certificate.\n\n  At any time during the court process, parents can sign a\n\nVoluntary Acknowledgment of Parentage form, and there will no longer be a\n\nneed for a judge to determine paternity. \n\n  These tests are extremely accurate in showing whether or not a\n\nman is the biological father of a child.\n\n \n\n  If the tests show that the man is the child 's biological father,\n\nhe pays for the tests.\n If the tests show he is not the father and we ( the Child Support\n\nEnforcement Division) are providing services to the family, then we pay the\n\ncost.\n\n  How does someone get services from the Child Support Enforcement\n\nDivision?\n\n  The Child Support Enforcement Division of the Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Revenue can assist parents in establishing paternity and child\n\nsupport orders, collecting child support for the families it serves and\n\nasking courts to adjust child support orders when circumstances change.\n Any parent or guardian of a child under 18 years old can ask for our\n\nhelp with a child support order or with establishing paternity by calling our\n\ntoll-free Customer Service Bureau at 1-800-332-2733.\n If a parent receives public assistance, he or she can talk to a\n\ncaseworker at the Department of Transitional Assistance about the services we\n\nprovide.\n Applications for our services are also available on-line by visiting\n\nour Internet homepage at www.state.ma.us/cse.\n A parent does not have to be on public assistance for us to help.\n It does not cost any money to apply for child support services from\n\nus.\n When a parent applies for our services, we will do our best to help\n\nthat parent establish paternity for their child and get the support to which\n\nhe or she is entitled.\n Whether we succeed depends upon how much information the parent gives\n\nus, how up-to-date and accurate it is, and what financial resources are\n\navailable to support the child once we locate the other parent.\n\n  What if the parents are already living together and are both\n\nsupporting their child?\n\n\n  Yes.\n Until they legally establish paternity, their child has no legal\n\nfather, even if both parents are living with the child.\n Things may change.\n A parent may not always be around or feel the same way about helping\n\nout.\n When they establish paternity, parents ensure their child 's rights to\n\ncertain benefits that are available only if paternity has been legally\n\nestablished.\n\n \n\n  The birth certificate will include the father 's name if the\n\nparents acknowledge paternity by signing a Voluntary Acknowledgment of\n\nPaternity form in the hospital or later at a city or town clerk 's office or\n\nat the Registry of Vital Records and Statistics, or a judge establishes\n\npaternity in court and orders that the father 's name be included on the birth\n\ncertificate. \n\n  Otherwise, the space for the father 's name will be left blank on\n\nthe child 's birth certificate.\n\n  For some children born before 1994, the father 's name is already\n\non the birth certificate.\n\n\n  Before 1994, the father 's name would appear on a child 's birth\n\ncertificate if both parents completed an affidavit in the hospital swearing\n\nthat he was the child 's father, but this did not establish legal fatherhood.\n The father 's name may be on the birth certificate, but that child is\n\nnot yet entitled to all the benefits of legal fatherhood unless the parents\n\nhave been to court since then to establish paternity.\n\n  If parents of a child born before 1994 want to establish legal\n\nfatherhood now, they can still do so, either by completing a Voluntary\n\nAcknowledgment of Parentage form at the city or town clerk 's office or at the\n\nRegistry of Vital Records and Statistics, or by going to court.\n\n \n\n  Generally, the mother can decide what the child 's name will be.\n Parents can choose their child 's first and last name together when\n\nthey fill out the birth certificate and acknowledge paternity for their child\n\nin the hospital.\n They will have to go to court if they later decide to change their\n\nchild 's name.\n\n  How long after a child is born can someone establish paternity\n\nfor that child?\n\n  Paternity can be established at any time in a child 's life.\n Parents can establish paternity for an older child by completing an\n\nacknowledgment form and filing it at the city or town clerk 's office in the\n\ncommunity where the child was born or at the Registry of Vital Records and\n\nStatistics, or by going to court. \n\n  What if the parent who is living with the child is not sure where\n\nthe other parent is?\n\n  The Child Support Enforcement Division will try to locate the\n\nother parent if the parent living with the child ( known as the custodial\n\nparent) applies for our services or receives public assistance.\n A custodial parent must give us as much information as possible about\n\nthe other parent - for example, full name, Social Security number, date of\n\nbirth, address, telephone number, the name and address of his or her\n\nemployer, the names of his or her parents, or information about his or her\n\nmotor vehicle ( the manufacturer, model or license number).", "subdomain": "USA_W_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "191abd28-ff2b-43ec-95ce-dcbf5b919e8c", "added": "2023-09-21T17:44:59.933209+00:00"}
