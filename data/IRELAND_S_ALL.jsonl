{"text": "<Riding>\n\n\n<$A> Well how did the riding go tonight\n<$B> It was good so it was Just I I couldn't believe that she was going to let me jump, that was only the fourth time you know It was great \n<$A> What did you call your horse\n<$B> I can't remember Oh Mary 's Town, oh\n<$A> And how did Mabel do\n<$B> Did you not see her whenever she was going over the jumps There was one time her horse refused and it refused three times And then, she got it round and she just lined it up straight and she just kicked it and she hit it with the whip, and over it went the last time you know And Stephanie told her she was very determined and very well-ridden  because it had refused the other times you know But Stephanie wouldn't let her give up on it She made her keep coming back and keep coming back, until, it jumped it you know It was good\n<$A> Yeah I 'm not so sure her jumping 's improving that much She uh, seemed to be holding the reins very tight\n<$B> Yeah she was That 's what Stephanie said   She  needed to, give the horse its head\n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A> She wasn't really getting into the jumping position the way she used to\n<$B> Mhm You see we haven't done any jumping for quite a few weeks now   you  know any proper jumping really And so she probably has lost the, momentum for it or if that 's the right word\n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A> Mm\n<$B> Did she  she was keen to go in the, the jumping lane But it 's been going for three four weeks now and there 's only one more week of it left and that 's next Monday So I said to or Stephanie said there was a new one starting at the end of September So I said she 'd be far better waiting, for that one, you know and starting anew fresh\n<$A> Yeah but I mean what is the jumping like\n<$B> It 's just with uh they do jumps and, whoever 's the best goes top of the league,   you know \n<$A>  So   it 's like another lesson but they they do jumping during it\n<$B> Well that 's the impression I got I 'm not sure now We didn't discuss it you know\n<$A> Well it sounds like more money\n<$B> Uh six pounds \n<$A> Do you not think we 're paying enough\n<$B> I do  But Stephanie says that 's for the club, the pony club, although outsiders can jump in it but that there 's a riding school pony league starting at the end of September, for anybody\n<$A> Right\n<$B> And so I think she 'll be just far better waiting and sorting that out\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Mabel said like she would go on Monday and do without her lesson on Tuesday, you know But I was keeping her going cos I says oh I wouldn't do without mine you see \n<$A> Well is she ready for school tomorrow\n<$B> I think so She 's her bag packed and, washed out and, her pencil case filled and so on\n<$A> Is she taking the school bag that uh she had at primary school\n<$B> Yeah she is\n<$A> Yeah Will it look okay with her new uniform\n<$B> Well it 's the same colour anyway \n<$A> Well that 's good\n<$B> Well she seems happy enough I said she didn't have to take it tomorrow, that she could take her you know the wee shoulder bag she has\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> And I said she could just take it tomorrow but she seems to want to take the schoolbag\n<$A> Aye she 's probably   better \n<$B>  So   although you see I don't think she 's getting any books or anything tomorrow I think tomorrow 's just to get her locker, and, sort of show them around, uhm you know their timetable and, give them their timetable and show them where the classrooms are   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  What about this uh   this bus pass\n<$B> Well\n<$A> Should she get that tomorrow\n<$B> She may get it tomorrow she may get it on Thursday They said when I rang up the Education Board that she would get it on her first day at school So I don't know if that would count as tomorrow,   or Thursday  But again they may organise that tomorrow you know\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A> She 's got a a zip on the inside pocket of, her blazer   I  said that, she should have a few pound in there just in case she might get stuck\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Well, I said to her that she did tell me that, but I said that uhm, she 'll probably be leaving her blazer in the cloakroom She 'll not be wearing it all the time And I wouldn't like it to be left down somewhere, with money in it\n<$A> Well now I think I think she should have, money that she can make a phonecall, and money, in case she loses her bus pass and she has to, pay for the bus home\n<$B> Mhm Well she should have I mean she 'll probably be taking a couple of pound to school everyday anyway, not to spend as such but you know for that reason, to have a couple of pound in her pocket just\n<$A> Well maybe somewhere in her   pencil case or something \n<$B>  Well she 's well   she 's got a zip in her pocket of her skirt\n<$A> Well that would do\n<$B> Yeah so that closes with a zip\n<$A> She may be taking other things in and out of that all the time\n<$B> Well I don't know I mean she 'll have her locker key in it too probably\n<$A> Mm What about uh Chloe and Penny They ready\n<$B> I think they 're ready too Chloe, didn't she show you her uniform already   Didn't she try it on \n<$A>  She did yeah   Mhm she looked good\n<$B> She 's very pleased with it so she is, very pleased So she has her schoolbag packed with her pencil case and that and her, bits and pieces that she 'll never have out for the first six months you know  But uhm, she wants to take you know the wee sort of flat schoolbag that she has\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> She wants to take that one But it falls off her shoulders awfully easy and I 'd rather she 'd take the other wee, rucksacky-type one, because it stays up much better But she 's insisting on taking the other one\n<$A> I remember years ago when we had the wee red Escort, we were up at that uh garage at Black 's Road, getting a new tyre\n<$B> Mhm\n<$A> And this uh, some friend of your dad 's, was working there\n<$B> I can't remember his name now I don't\n<$A> Andy or Johnny somebody\n<$B> Ah\n<$A> Was it Andy\n<$B> Wasn't Andy no\n<$A> Anyway he was telling us that uh\n<$B> Was it not Basil No\n<$A> No it wasn't Basil He was telling us that that morning he 'd just uh, sent his youngest child out to primary school  with a wee tear in his eye  And uh we 're doing it now\n<$B> Ah, will you have a wee tear in your eye\n<$A> Well I won't be seeing her going so \n<$B> Mm it seems strange I have to take Julie down at her usual time and Chloe starts at ten past nine, so I 'll just you know there 's no point in me doing anything else going anywhere else So I 'll just take her down then But uh I don't know how long, I 'll be expected to stay, cos I 'll have Monica with me as well\n<$A> Somehow I don't think it 's going to be a problem for Chloe\n<$B>  No She 's looking forward to it I think\n<$A> Yeah I don't think it 'll be like my first day at school\n<$B> I don't remember mine\n<$A> Oh I remember mine I think I screamed and kicked the whole day\n<$B> That wouldn't surprise me now  I don't remember anything about my first day I I don't remember my first, primary one really at all\n<$A> Oh I remember sitting beside, a fella called Bernard Bowman, and he was the only friend in the world I had  for a few weeks\n<$B> I don't remember I remember, half-way through P-one, we changed from the old Lambeg school, to the Harmonstown Hill Primary school And I remember changing over And I remember before that I remember, walking home from school a couple of times, my mum pushing the big pram So it must 've been Angeline still in the big pram She must 've been about three But they did that then didn't they They kept you in a big pram for a long time\n<$A> They did \n<$B> Aye that 's what me mum always says about Angeline and all\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Cos the prams were so big that you could stay in them for ages You just didn't have a buggy you see   And so \n<$A>  Well I   I sort of way remember, before I started school we used to go down, from Finaghy on the train, to Belfast and walk on round to, my granny 's on the Donegall Road\n<$B> Mhm\n<$A> And I think, my mum took the big pram on the train\n<$B> Yes She did She told   me \n<$A>  They   slid the doors open   And  uh so there 's was always a, like   a mail , a mail uh carriage\n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B>  A guard  \n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> And there was these big sacks in it, but you could there 's room to wheel the pram on as well\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> You know   But some of those trains , some of those trains were steam trains you know\n<$B>  Would somebody 've helped youse  \n<$B> Were they\n<$A> Aye\n<$B> Oh I didn't think you were that old a puppy\n<$A> No no there  there were steam trains yeah big puffers  And uh, I remember the uh, there was a stationmaster at each station\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> And there was always it wasn't just a shelter It was a   complete \n<$B>  They sold   tickets and everything\n<$A> Oh yeah they sold tickets but there was a, a fireplace and all   in the  shelter And you used to come in and it was completely closed in You opened the door and closed it behind you\n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B> Uh-huh\n<$A> And there was seats right round with the fire place in the middle And then at the end of it, there was a like a little office, and that 's where the uh stationmaster stayed\n<$B> Mhm\n<$A> And he gave the tickets out from there and came out and, put more coal on the fire and, and the odd time he had a pot of tea going and you you 'd get people sharing and that so You called the the guy at Finaghy Gerry  In fact there was two, uhm two guys One was this, Gerry was the smaller of the two and the more friendly, the other was a bigger guy And uh, I sort of way remember him because a few times there were, us kids playing around the station and he used to chase you, you know\n<$B> Hm, and of course you never needed chased cos you were such a good child\n<$A> That 's right\n<$B>  Mm, mm I don't remember, my first experience of going on a train was whenever I was, starting Friends '\n<$A> Ah I was well used to it before I went to Friends '\n<$B> No I wasn't I remember trying to cross the railway lines one day, and I tripped and fell and I looked up and the Dublin Express was heading straight for me And I had to crawl across the railway lines to get out of the way of the Dublin Express Tell you I never crossed the railway lines again\n<$A> Did the driver see you Did he\n<$B> No he didn't stop at all \n<$A> Did he sound his horn\n<$B> I don't remember   I  don't, I don't know I just remember looking up and seeing it coming, and crawling across the railway lines And I couldn't go home,   I 'd cut my legs and, my socks were covered in oil And I couldn't go home  cos my mummy would 've killed me  never mind the train I had to turn my socks inside out, and then of course all the oil went into my cuts  And I had to go round school the whole day, with my socks turned inside out\n<$A>  No", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

Mace the other day and didn't know\n<$D> Oh   God \n<$C>  But uhm   it was the day that I was in work and this guy came up to Winemark, and I was out the back and he said to my manageress Janie do you know this  this girl   And I looked  at it and said that 's my sister  And he was like oh right, well she dropped her wallet in the Mace And so I phoned home and told,   Una \n<$E>  My staff card was in it  \n<$D>  You didn't  , you 're very careless with your wallet so you are\n<$F> But wait to you hear   then uh \n<$D>  I went   to the Whiterock Road one day to get her wallet\n<$C> But then uhm\n<$F> What were you doing on the   Whiterock Road in the first place Una \n<$D>  She dropped it outside our door  \n<$E> Mm\n<$F> What were you doing on the Whiterock Road\n<$D> And the woman   who lifted it was from the Whiterock \n<$E>  I dropped it outside our door  \n<$A> Oh right and she just took it home with her\n<$D> She just took it home with her She didn't know who owned it\n<$A>   Yeah that 's  fair enough\n<$B>  Yeah, yeah  \n<$D> And rang\n<$E> She rang like she rang Jordanstown and everything and they were able to tell me, because there was no home phone number but my student card was there\n<$F> The same thing happened   though \n<$D>  Wouldn't you   think you 'd learn your lesson\n<$C> Mrs uhm some woman came to the door yesterday and said hello Has Una, is Una a doctor And I was looking at her going oh dear God who is this And then I was looking more and I thought it was Susan Baxter 's mum you know a girl who used to be in my a girl who used to be in my year at school And then   then  uh yes she is And, and she went oh right yes because that was what threw me Yeah I got a phonecall telling me that uhm Una had left her her has left her wallet in the Mace uhm, and my number was the only number in it And I was just standing there going oh right, uhm\n<$A>  Please  \n<$D> Was this on a different occasion\n<$C>   No this was the same day \n<$E>  No this was on Friday   You see I have Benjamin 's number written on his card I have his home number written on it which I 'd taken and that was the only phone number in the wallet   So  the guy in the Mace phoned that\n<$D>  Right  \n<$C> She said that he seemed very very concerned about it\n<$E> Really\n<$D> Was she at our door\n<$C> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> yeah She said that she might 've she

Yeah I 've got his his business card and I 'd written down his last time, when he was home at Christmas   we were going out and I wrote it down \n<$A>  And so  That was very considerate of the guy   though just to phone somebody and say   do you know this girl \n<$E>  Yeah  \n<$C> But the reason that he came up to Winemark was because uhm somebody had said that Una worked in Winemark\n\n<$E> With

<unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Shannon to Dublin  \n<$C>  Well generally Lauren  , the flight that I come on, uh when I left America   I  wasn't to get off at Shannon   The  people that were getting   off at  Shannon would get off and we would   sit on \n<$A>  Aye  \n<$A>  Aye  \n<$A>  Off  \n<$A>  Yeah   sit on\n<$C> But when I was going out to the States,   I  went down to Dublin and I got on in Dublin but yes I had to get off, in Shannon and wait for an hour until   the flight you know  But there coming across, I wasn't   off  the flight at all\n<$A>  Uh-huh  \n<$A>  Oh Lord right Yes  \n<$A>  Aye  \n<$A> Well do you know that one time we had a  a table quiz up here, go back about five years And Gemma won the first prize and it was Aer Lingus giving a flight from Belfast to Shannon Now I remember Beezer God rest him, when I came in I said about Gemma winning and Beezer says, God that was great I said, to tell you the truth I said, I can never see her using it So it was valid up to about six months So I said to her one day I said uhm, when are you going to use that She says, I don't know I said, if I 'd 've been near you that night I would 've said, don't take that first prize Go down the line and get something else But anyway she says, I know what I 'll do with it but she never said She went up to Father McBurney, his sister 's living in Ennis in County   Clare  and she says Father, there 's a belated birthday present And he said what  He said oh Gemma he says, I 'll pay you for those No she says no problem you

Aer Lingus, and he said <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> he sat back and read from   Belfast to Shannon \n<$B>  Oh good  \n<$B>  And he hadn't,   he hadn't the bother of   driving or \n<$A>  Correct   And he came back that way It was a return Uh he appreciated it But I couldn't get over these ones but   then I forgot that they give , they can go to Shannon and then they can sit almost probably I don't know But you know Aer Lingus is doing very badly\n<$B>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$B> Mhm\n<$A> See where they 're taking the shamrock off the   tail and  I think  that 's, I think that 's awfully sad to see that\n<$B>  Yes Seen that  \n<$B> Uh-huh\n<$A> Do you not\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> But I mean it 's a State airline and I think it 's an awful shame   why they have to \n<$B>  And why are   they changing\n<$A> I don't know to be honest with you You see Ryanair is sweeping them off their feet And Value and all the rest of it Now finishing   all that Tell me  about our Anne Don't worry about our Anne, we 'll be examining her later Anne O'Connell\n<$C>  Too much competition going on  \n<$B> Well uhm, we went over to see   her  She can't really join in the conversation But it 's grand to have two or three people that you can talk with and   she \n<$A>  Aren't youse awful good  \n<$A>  Pauline   you need it   and  When you 're visiting anyone sick you need a second or a third one to let the conversation flow\n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B> You 're not   <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>  in any awkward   silence  You see if you went up on your own to  and talked to Anne, Anne tries to answer you  , You  can't make out what she 's saying, You 're   <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> \n<$A>  No  \n<$A>  Aye  \n<$A>  I couldn't  \n<$A>  Margaret   O'Dowd has done it\n<$B> She 's frustrated because she can't make herself   understood  It doesn't work out   too well \n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A>  No it 's not   fair to anybody But is she, I wonder is she still in the same room\n<$B> She is\n<$A> It 's a place I don't like\n<$B> Well now Anita Martin told me there a week ago that they she and Terry were over visiting   and  the nurse came til her and told her that they had found Anne You know she 's in a room on her own\n<$A>  Aye  \n<$A> Yes   She 's got the Zimmer in front of her \n<$B>  And they wouldn't be in,   they wouldn't be in and out all that\n<$A> No\n<$B> She 'd got along the corridor on the Zimmer and was standing at the outside door And they were afraid that she was going to speed off like So I think from that Enda has arranged these classes Uh she was over for aromatherapy class   in Beech Hall on the Andersonstown  Road they had the uh Bobby Duffy 's   centre  Bobby knows Anne and he 's very fond of her\n<$A>  Yes, Andersonstown  \n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> Excuse me that was in <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> 's house The day that they bought that house that evening I was up in <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$B> Is that right Well do you know I was at school with one of them two of them <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> Mabel <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> and then Anita <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>  Anita  <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  was Head Girl the year I went to Balmoral   <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  And Mabel was younger than me   And Mabel married  uh,  Doctor Sheehy\n<$A>  I remember their names Anita used to  \n<$A>  Aye  \n<$A>  Aye It 's a beautiful house  \n<$A> That 's right\n<$B> She was his  she was his first wife\n<$A> That 's   right \n<$B>  She   died when they were quite young\n<$C> And is Doctor Sheehy married secondly then\n<$B> Oh he is\n<$A> He is I remember well But, even to get her to those classes like it 's a very good thing too but it 's sad to see her truthfully and honestly I 've only been over the once because I 've no   transport \n<$C>  Well Lauren  , I haven't saw Anne O'Connell in about two and a half years   Last  time I ever saw her it was in the Royal in the   caring  for the elderly\n<$A>  Aye  \n<$A>  Aye  \n<$A> Aye\n<$C> And today I could, meet no-one and tell them I thought she looked wonderful\n<$B> Oh I don't\n<$A> You see I I would agree with   you even when I was there \n<$C>  Because   the girl had no interest\n<$A> No\n<$C> I didn't think she could follow There was another young girl that was her godchild   there \n<$B>  Rachel   was there   Marie 's daughter Rachel, but saying \n<$A>  Yes The day we were there, Rachel  \n<$B> She loves Rachel\n<$C> Saying that, Anne wouldn't be enthusing about anybody visiting her That would be my opinion because I don't think she had   any interest \n<$A>  Excuse me   I agree with you That 's what, that 's what I thought when I came out And I said to Margaret O'Dowd, I said, Margaret, we were there, making conversation and the door opens and these three young ones came in And do you know something it was a joy to see them coming I thought for young ones it was lovely of them   And then  Margaret O'Dowd, that Rachel one was one of them, and two other lassies And I said to them, you 're very good coming over I looked at her and I said, I just said you know Anne Anne Anne has been very good to you   But I said it still is lovely to see  Yes I said I think it 's lovely to see it\n<$B>  Who was it  \n<$B>  She was She 's her grandmother  \n<$B> She brought her everywhere with her when she was a child\n<$A> Yes But Anne is, and like God help her, like we said to her was she happy, you know, what about the food   She goes \n<$B>  The whole thing about it is  , she wouldn't be happy anywhere Like she she 's not really uh, she  she couldn't be happy anywhere in the state she 's in\n<$A> I know like God help her No Lauren, I think it 's a pity I think Nazareth, I think Nazareth is the answer   for her \n<$B>  Sure   Nazareth won't take her\n<$A> Sure I know they won't But that 's that 's the type of place But do you know where we went one Sunday afternoon One Sunday evening, only that we were in a hurry home, you were going to get your front door knocked in, Pam Dwyer brought us up, she 's a friend of a, the Saint John of God place, up the Upper Springfield Road\n<$B> Aye but sure they don't have nursing care in it\n<$A> No they don't That 's the unfortunate thing   There are rooms I \n<$B>  Beechmount 's the only   one, the only place that has all three   uh sections , residential care, nursing home   and EMI which is  elderly, uh   mentally infirm \n<$A>  I would say, yes  \n<$A>  Aye, yeah  \n<$A>  Mental infirm   Now, she brought us up there\n<$B> You never, once you go into Beechmount, no matter what happens you, you never have to move\n<$A> You see that 's the thing That 's the answer But, for anybody that would be able to look after themselves that Saint John of God this place is just, it 's over a hundred pounds cheaper than Nazareth And the rooms are ensuite And next to their wardrobe you open you think it 's a second wardrobe and when you open it, their hand basin, their cooker, their oven and their microwave\n<$C>   Self-contained \n<$B>  So they have to cook for themselves  \n<$A> That 's because yes, that 's what I 'm saying if you 're able to Now I   don't know \n<$B>  So it 's   something like, it 's not even the same as <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> you know cos they 've no cooking facilities They only can make a cup of tea for themselves\n<$A> And Lauren if you saw

What\n<$A> Now now this is really really scares him I was about to make bloody dessert\n<$C> What\n\n<$A> I was about to make the bloody dessert and took out the bar of chocolate to make it with which I thought was two hundred and fifty grams Now we 're talking a big bar of chocolate   here  I actually didn't even check it I just thought, well I mean   there 's  not going to be any more chocolate in it than that\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$D> But how could you not have checked it I mean how could could you have thought that you you knew what\n<$A> I don't know I mean it was just a   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> yeah yeah \n<$B>  I can understand that You take that bar and you think you 'd be very used to looking at it   and you just imagine that two hundred and fifty grams is probably like a half of it or   something  as opposed   to you know \n<$A>  Yeah \n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$A>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear>   You know one of the big bars of chocolate out of Marks And I thought\n<$D> Not cooking\n<$A> No no but it it it 's said to be quality dark   chocolate \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$D> Oh sorry\n<$A> Well I thought well there 's not going to be <unclear> several sylls </unclear> one of those big   I mean  there 's not going to be any more chocolate in it than   that  So of course took it out to do the recipe and looked at the recipe and it said two hundred and fifty grams and it was only one hundred and fifty grams   So  I had to run down to Iceland which all sounds very well but it actually takes twelve minutes to get there and twelve minutes to get back again And when you 're on a very very bloody   tight schedule \n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$C>  Mhm  \n<$C>  Oh  \n<$B>  Tight schedule   \n<$A>   Twenty-four minutes later I was forty-five minutes over \n<$C>  What what time, what time did you   what time did you have everybody over at\n<$A> Three o'clock\n<$D> She told   us three \n<$C>  And by the time   you got went to Mass, was that two\n<$A> Well I 've been up from nine   o 'clock  uhm and went to half ten   Mass  and then I walked, I walked well ended up walking back from Mass\n<$C>  Oh right  \n<$C>  Uh-huh  \n<$D> Uh-huh, Well that was\n<$A> Uh-huh\n<$D> Really silly\n<$A> No buses   And I  phoned every taxi company that I 've ever   known of , And they they 'd they 'd all let you go through the spiel   of hello could I have a taxi for this  No but but they let you go through the whole spiel and then they say sorry love we 're fully booked\n<$D>  Why <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$?>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$B> Why were they booked on a Sunday at half ten\n<$A> Apparently it 's   Mother 's Day \n<$B>  Oh it 's Mother 's Day   Yeah   I suppose  people are going out and\n<$C>  Oh right  \n<$A> So uhm, so that was fine but I 'd already bloody well walked for fifty-five minutes to an hour so I wasn't really best pleased at having to walk down again and then back up again <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> And I was on a very tight   schedule at this stage \n<$D>  Could you not just have   stayed smaller, you know reduced everything a bit   Uh well by half \n<$A>  I didn't know   whether\n\n<$A> So then of course Seamus arrived over at a quarter past two And I opened the door and I was like do you know you 're really early\n<$D> Lovely yeah\n<$A> And he said yeah I said that 's okay as long as you know cos I haven't hoovered or anything yet So he came in and that was grand And uhm, why did I start to tell you this\n<$C> I thought you   <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  You were asking about wine, and I said you asked me what, did I want wine or something like that\n<$?>  Making this story up as usual  \n<$A> Yeah well so when I went down to Iceland  I then thought I 'll buy a big bottle of blackberry and raspberry water for Mary because she 's pregnant  It occurred to me ten minutes ago   that actually , she had Charles you know   ten months ago now  I mean that 's why I bought it, for pregnant Mary\n<$B>  Are you serious  \n<$B>  Oh my God that 's    \n<$B>  That 's absolutely hilarious\n<$D> Not for Jessie who might be driving\n<$A> No no no for pregnant Mary No I actually think that 's a bit scary\n\n<$B> But it 's funny the way you can like remember things from you know,   the way  it just sticks in you head like that You just obviously you associate her with being\n<$A>  Uh-huh  \n<$A> Aye with being pregnant\n<$B> Pregnant or not drinking or something you know\n<$A> It I mean it only occurred to me cos then I was thinking uh, about five minutes ago I was thinking oh right okay well Mary 's coming round and I wonder what time Charles 'll go to bed at and that, And then I thought yes because she 's had the baby now I 'm   seriously concerned now \n<$B>  That 's hilarious   Och your house is just so gorgeous now You must be just so happy here It 's really lovely\n<$A> Och I am I mean I do I really like it now I must say\n<$B> Och it 's really really beautiful\n\n<$C> Well to be honest I think it 's fine You know it 's not\n<$A> Greg absolutely loves that clock\n<$C> Cos it 's not, I think that those uhm, it 's fine you know it 's not about it it 's not what you would choose   yourself  but at the same time it 's not that it absolutely stands out\n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$A> But I don't think that it 's in keeping with   the rest of  the room\n<$B>  Serious  \n<$D> It 's what you find in like a great-auntie 's house or something like\n<$A> Yeah I I laughed the other day girls Aunt Janice came to get the delivery of this sofa and I came back in again and this, was like this, and this, was like this\n<$B> Oh really\n<$A> And everything was angled  She had gone round the house and angled everything\n<$B> Oh my God\n<$A> And I was <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>, cos I have to, I mean like that would drive me mad because it 's actually not quite\n<$C> Straight\n<$A> It 's not quite straight It 's not like I 'm Little Miss Tidy or anything but I don't like things angled And she 'd gone round and she 'd re-arranged the bottles in the bathroom   And she 'd angled, she 'd angled  something in the kitchen and, and you get uhm you see uhm uh something was angled in the kitchen   you know tonight after she 'd left  Oh just re-arranged like where they where they were like just where they were sitting   She  wanted them more central\n<$B>  Are you serious Oh my God that 's she just did  \n<$D>  What do you mean re-arranged the bottles  \n<$D>  Oh right  \n<$D> Mhm\n<$A> I mean I had two of them sort of over to the side and she wanted them more central than that so I had to go back round the house de-angling   them It was just it was so funny \n<$D>  Oh that 's hilarious That 's so funny   And she obviously thought she was like with the delivery people as well because she was afraid of them marking your wall\n<$A> No but that was great   because \n<$D>  I know   That 's what I 'm saying\n<$A> You know if Rowena had been here, not that I mean no harm to Rowena but she probably would have been a bit like me it wouldn't have occurred to her probably\n<$C> Yeah cos it wouldn't actually occur to you I think   <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  No well   it would occur to me now after because the last time, when they brought in the first sofa they actually did scrape it along the   wall  And I can see where the scrape   it isn't it it 's it 's marked the paint but  it 's not\n<$C>  Oh right  \n<$B>  Yeah has marked the paint, yeah yeah  \n<$B> Yeah it just has yeah Mary-Louise that 's an absolutely gorgeous photograph of you two Absolutely beautiful\n<$A> Mhm I like that one\n<$B> It 's beautiful of both of you Whose wedding was that at\n<$A> I think that was at Colin and Susan 's wedding\n<$C> Yeah cos you were you were wearing that outfit\n<$A> Yeah\n\n<$B> Here I think this is really weird Was I telling somebody this last night in the pub Tom O'Donnell was on the phone the other day   and he said  I think this is really weird I got an invitation to Gene White 's   wedding \n<$D>  Yes you were telling me  \n<$C>  Tom   did\n<$B> Tom O'Donnell did That was so weird  No I said actually no we didn't I mean, the truth we 're going to be away not that Gene would have known that because you could send somebody an invitation and\n\n<$B> On the other hand we you know we didn't invite Gene to our wedding and there 's a little bit of that as well You know there is that bit of you 're not invited to somebody 's wedding you don't invite them to yours you know No but I think there 's a bit of, there 's a bit more of that than you might  , expect actually  And that 's and that 's I mean truly honest to God   <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> , after all we didn't invite him and we would have been in Australia anyway But I thought that was really weird actually that out of the blue   they  suddenly invited Tom O'Donnell\n<$D>  Well maybe yeah  \n<$C>  You were going to Australia  \n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$C> And is Tom going\n<$A> What I think 's weird about that\n<$B> I think so yeah\n<$A> What I think 's weird about that is that okay he invited Tom which is a bit strange, but Tom was on the stag, but so was Roger\n<$C> Yeah\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> You know I find that odd\n<$C> Yeah   so do I \n<$D>  Did he, so   unless the invitation, it was before the stag was it Uhm so Gene might have heard on the stag\n\n<$A> But Tom Tom was Tom not absolutely amazed to be invited on the stag\n<$C>   Yeah he was \n<$B>  I think I think   he was pretty amazed But uhm I think that a lot of Tom I mean I think a lot of the reason Roger was invited on the stag was probably cos he knew Dublin as well   I mean  I think that was a large part of it I think Tom was invited because just for\n<$A>  Yeah \n<$C>  Mhm  \n<$C> Apparently he was in the Morning Star on Christmas Eve\n<$B> Probably, so they were all chatting about it and Tom and as I say Roger and Donall and you know But I think that that 's really weird\n<$C> Isn't it\n<$B> But they should have a lovely day Having said that I 'm sure it 'll be a really great day now Easter Monday is a nice day to book for a wedding you know\n<$C> Och it 's a pity you 're not\n<$B> I know it is a pity actually I would like to be there Was that your door or was that the settee\n<$A>   See if my settee was making those  kind of noises it 'd be going back\n<$C>  Well unless maybe you have an invitation and it just hasn't arrived  \n\n<$C> Doreen do you have that shirt in pink\n<$B> Uh yeah   actually  it 's my mum 's shirt   I bought  it for her uhm and I just thought I 'd wear it\n<$C>  It 's beautiful  \n<$C>  It 's absolutely gorgeous  \n<$C> It 's lovely Uhm unless maybe they have and it just haven't arrived\n<$B> I don't I don't think so I don't actually think because he probably, Uhm really I 'm only saying this to you and obviously I 'm not offended or anything I just thought it was odd\n\n<$E> We then came home and spent, I went up to bed, and he spent about an hour on the internet trying to book a holiday or something just so that he could kind of say the next day you know  Then he set his alarm for half six   cos he was going to get up  and go out but his alarm woke Charles\n<$C>  Oh Jesus  \n<$C> Oh no\n<$B> Oh no\n<$E> So then he was up So then he couldn't   you  know he couldn't sort of leave so it was a disaster\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Oh God Disaster\n<$C> But he cos I cos when he said last night then I was saying I was thinking och no maybe he has something organised cos he was saying aw you know\n<$E> I knew he didn't but\n<$C> All in hand girls all in\n<$E> I I can sort of understand because I kept forgetting  , myself that  it was anything to do with me you know\n<$C>  Yeah yeah  \n\n<$B> But, were off with your mum and dad and everything today were you\n<$E> Yes we were up, uhm we went to the Drumnagrey\n<$B> Oh

all our grammatical mistakes\n<$B> Yeah, Una 's sending the tape off to MI Five\n<$D> It 's purely descriptive   You describe how  people speak And there 's   none of  this you should say this\n<$C>  Oh right  \n<$C>  Right  \n<$C> Okay\n<$A> Here Mary would you like a glass of wine or would you like a cup of tea or\n<$B> Well seeing as you 're pregnant \n<$A> Or would you like a glass of special water\n<$B> Give her a glass of wine <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$E> I think I 'll just have a wee small glass\n<$A> So a small glass of wine and so you want a glass of wine and you want a

thronged\n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B> Dan Simpson was in Derry last night  , at  the railway museum There 's a festival starting this week in   Derry  And uhm, can't remember what it is, some arts thing   going on  uhm that showed a part of the show\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A>  Aye  \n<$A> Oh did it\n<$B> Mhm\n<$A> What bit\n<$B> Och just a wee, it must be a, solo Uh there was a a fella and a girl on the stage <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>   you  know\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A> A guy with black hair\n<$B> Aye\n<$A> And she 'd blonde hair\n<$B> Mhm\n<$A> Aye that was the two lead\n<$B> That   was  just all it showed you know\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A> He was, he was very good, the fella who played the lead The the Danny you know like the John Travolta part <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> I can't even remember his name Uhm, and like the uh they were all very good but the best you know the acting wasn't that good but you see the singing and dancing was great You know all And there was  a a woman who did, she was the choreographer but she also did this part where they go to a dance you   see  And there 's this girl comes in from another school and wins a dance competition and she was, she did the dancing   herself  God she was brilliant, you know they were doing jiving and all this She was brilliant And like even the dancers she had the whole lot of them doing it and it was some size of a cast I 'd say it   was  easy fifty or sixty people you know\n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B> Well were there any in the music society your music society   in it \n<$A>  Margaret Bartlett   was in it and then big Jonathan   Kirwin  He was one of the  the the gang you know the male fellas, But uh it was wild funny he came out at one point dressed for the dance you know they 've this high school dance and he 'd like a red blazer with black trim on it and all He looked like a waiter  If you 'd seen him this wee thin red tie you know But as I say like in between the acting and all you couldn't hear the girls at all you know But uhm it was wild funny because they had all this like, a scenery of you know a just a brick wall, but every time somebody wanted to go off left of the stage they just walked through the wall There was this like bit of the wall opened up you know  Well I thought Gerald was going to die laughing And then they 'd wheel a car on in through the wall you know   that sort of  way You know it was wild funny And then during one bit uhm, they maybe don't have the lights you know to do it right but probably what they meant to do was black out most of the stage and keep the lights on the front where these girls were talking so that the boys behind could clear the stage   but  you could still see them perfectly And they were chatting away in the middle of this scene and these boys just walked on lifted a table and walked back off again you   know  But uhm, and what and the band and all was brilliant you know the band   was really good \n<$B>  Oh aye  \n<$B>  Mm mhm  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Mm   It 's funny that show that they did in the Riverside that put me completely   off that show forever It was awful \n<$A>  Och it was dreadful Sure they were only weans   That was wild Desperate But it just shows you the interest that show has We were saying you know, God if Portrush ever did it I mean they would have no problem getting young people, no problem at all Because I mean it it shows you the interest when you look at the audiences you know\n<$B> Aye\n<$A> But uh and then we came out we went  next door into the Linenhall for a drink And then we ended up we went over to the Strand Road and went into the Strand Tavern No we were going to go into, the Carrick, the bar, and we looked beside and the Strand Tavern 's beside it and there was a queue coming out the door so we thought oh we 'll go in there So it was a disco and all   So  we went in there and stayed to the death of it So I was in here, I came back in about two o'clock\n<$B>  Oh right  \n<$B> I never heard a sound and I went to bed   after  half twelve, and I heard nothing after that\n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A> Oh we just got in we were walking, it was packed sure that tiny wee place you know the upstairs the disco bit We were trying to sort of get from the front door over to the dance floor you know, and I felt this tap on the shoulder Who was it but Jerry Jarvis, you know from   the course the journalism course  And uhm I was saying to him about Charlie sending down the bit of him in the Derry Journal and then seeing   his by-line and all in it  this week so\n<$B>  Oh yes uh-huh uh-huh  \n<$B>  Uh-huh uh-huh  \n<$B> Is he   still  working with the Derry Journal\n<$A>  And then  \n<$A> Oh aye he only started in June you see That was it He was the boy who was in Cookstown   do you remember \n<$B>  I know   mhm\n<$A> So uhm I was <.> just  chatting to him for a wee while And then we were up dancing and I looked down and who did I see I thought God  those two are wild familiar looking, these two fellas standing Who was it Desmond and Donagh Byrne, standing   I saw  them two But it was absolutely packed And funny we parked uhm do you know when you go down the Strand Road to, what do they call it Rock Mills you know the   house  the students ' residence   the  halls of residence and you go up left   It 's not up the Rock Road I don't know  what what it is It 's up right up the side of Andy   Cole 's bar there  And I would always if we 're down there I would always park up near the houses in there We were coming back down the hill and the police there was about six policemen at the bottom of the hill all out with their guns and all and one of them was sitting noting down all this stuff I don't know what he was writing whether it was the cars or whatever you know\n<$B>  Oh right mhm  \n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B>  The side of the road up there or something  \n<$B>  Mhm mhm  \n<$B> Aye\n<$A> Because I was saying it was funny we came over the bridge last night and   nobody Not a one  You know the way you could never come over that bridge without being stopped\n<$B>  Not searched you mhm  \n<$B> That 's right\n<$A> But it was good enough good craic you know and, Like we were sitting any time there was a bit of music we were sitting clapping away and like everybody starts clapping along to the music   you  know It was good craic\n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B> Well you 'll have to let Donagh know how it went now\n<$A> Oh that 's right But he said he was talking to Jonathan now so\n<$B> Oh right\n<$A> And uh, what else And there 's a, Derry 's wine and cheese party 's on next Saturday   So  Jane has tickets to sell but I says I don't know how I got out of that for I got sent raffle tickets but they didn't send me   tickets for the, so I have to buy , because they 've to be in for that   Saturday  so we 're all going to go to that next   Saturday \n<$B>  Oh  \n<$B>  Why is she doing it <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>  \n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B>  Mm where   is that The White   Horse \n<$A>  The   White Horse But uhm Jane and Geoffrey and them were up, well Geoffrey was up a couple of years ago when he did a Derry show, and they were saying like it 's really nice They have like it 's not just wine and cheese they have wine but they have you know   a buffet and then  they 've a band and all They have they take over like a suite just for themselves so I didn't think it would be all that I thought it was just standing about   like  with a glass of wine in your hand making chit-chat you know So we 'll definitely have to sort out, even if you buy a book and I buy a book   that  would do rightly\n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B> And uh it would probably be more of your music society now would go to that,   maybe sure Jerry <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  I would think, aye I don't know now if they 'd go or not   Mm But as I say that 's a a car full we have now   anyway so  and Tyrone 's going to drive next week so\n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B> Very good\n<$A> I think that 's, that sorted out But it, there 's some crowd in Derry you know on a night out like that   You  know you think a lot of people come into Portrush, til you see that place just  I mean that 's before even places empty   you  know say about two o'clock or whatever time everybody comes out or half one It 's some crowd of people\n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B>  Aye uh-huh  \n<$B> Well there 's probably as many coming if you were around here when they 're all spilling out too   about half one  and two   o'clock you know \n<$A>  I suppose aye  \n<$A>  Maybe it 's   just they all wander about that much   it doesn't  seem like it you know It was that funny we just saw this queue and went up and said wonder what 's on here you know We says to these boys at the end of the queue look what 's everybody They says oh there 's a disco And we were saying well it must be good for nobody 's queuing in anywhere else you   know   So we just decided to go in there And the fella that was playing in the Teen Angel you know he 's sort of like the  the the Frankie Valli type of character you know He is a boy called John Doherty  or Doherty  uhm from Highland Radio  , and you see him on the ad  for the Richmond Centre\n<$B>  Aye  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B>  Oh yes mhm  \n<$B> He was in the Derry Journal   Mhm \n<$A>  Aye   You know the ad for the Richmond   Centre  that 's is usually on at Christmas He 's in it So he he just took like one song to sing And if you 'd seen the boy was doing what Donagh would 've been doing \n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B> Was it awful\n<$A> Ah Well he didn't sing that much so I began to think maybe that they took some songs off him because he Donagh had was supposed to be doing five so I began to think maybe your man wasn't very good cos it  he didn't do five songs   One  was from the like like the high school kids came in and did it But if you 'd seen him, he was about five foot and a wee round weeble man you know, and this short black hair and these shades on him you know If you 'd seen him  Such a difference    Of course  I know You couldn't imagine it Honest to God But as I say he was  only he only came in for the high school dance He was meant to be like the star who came and sang a few songs   you know,  But as I say he didn't sing very much\n<$B>  Donagh 's very good  \n<$B>  Complete opposite  \n<$B>  Oh aye uh-huh uh-huh  \n<$B> Well maybe, they were left in the lurch Sure they might 've been\n<$A> Aye\n<$B> Couldn't do anything else\n<$A> But I mean their costumes and all were nice and", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "01248886-a509-4293-97c8-0dd38ccffe1d", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.126905+00:00"}
{"text": "<Student chat 2>\n\n\n<$A> There 's a shop on the Dublin Road called Natural Interiors and we keep driving by but we haven't been in it yet Uh we wanted,   we don't  like those curtains\n<$B>  Oh yes Natural Interiors  \n<$B> Beside the Ulster Bank\n<$A> Yeah that 's it We don't like those curtains and we actually whenever the curtains are down that 's a really nice area you know just that bay with the   window and all  So we thought well we don't really want that covered up, but we need a bit of privacy so we thought we 'd actually get a screen you know like a standing   screen  and just in the evening whenever we 're in here put the screen up\n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B> Or you could   just get uhm , curtains that when you pull them back they go right back Means like   during the day \n<$A>  And get the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  \n<$A>  Yeah   aye but it 's still you know I sort of , I 'd want the   view \n<$C>  Martina 's   just anti-curtains\n<$A> Yeah I I 'm not an   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  But your window might not be exactly   the same, if you get that done again it might not be the same shape\n<$A> What\n<$B> You know if you get your bay done again   it  mightn't be exactly the same   Like when  we got ours done it wasn't the same angle\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>    \n<$C> How can you get the bay done How can you   get the bay done \n<$B>  Did you get your windows done  \n<$A> No   our \n<$B>  Have   you to get your windows done, sometime\n<$A> I don't yes but I don't know how much it would affect the whole wood there I don't want rid of that wood really, you know round the   frame \n<$B>  I was thinking   that 's what they did in our house Took all the wood away\n<$A> Did they\n<$B> We had a big you know all the, nineteen twenties stuff, big thick   uh frames \n<$C>  and replaced them with what  \n<$B> They 're the ones   that your   And they were alright for about sixty years\n<$A>  Just modern frames  \n<$A> Mm Oh I don't know What do you, well see we thought about getting just a screen You know the way you could use it in other parts of the house as well or   but  we never found one But just, we keep driving by this   place  you know and they they 've got the the best screens in the window because they 're just plain wooden frames with like a white gauze on them   You know  so they would let in as much light as possible but, it would still give you that wee bit of privacy You know maybe like us sitting here in the evening time you know we don't want people gawping in\n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B> You know like uhm, like those Japanese things like those with the black and the white   squares \n<$C>  We saw them   yes but they were, how much were they\n<$A> They were about seven hundred pounds   <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>  This was a laugh You should have seen us We went into do you know that Tom Washington on   Washington  Place   is it  No it 's not Tom, Tom Rothwell 's place   on  Washington Place, just to get some different ideas of what to do with windows We hadn't decided on the screen at this stage We just wanted to look at what like a designy sort of person would have And oh my God I was   mortified  Saw all this money and your wee man came round and started talking about the design of our house you know sort of And uh he was talking about being up in, what was it he was saying about\n<$B>  What  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$C> Can't remember but he said, oh we 've just done, we 've we 've we 've actually just done a house Uh I can show you some photographs of that And he showed us uh, I mean the room, the one of the downstairs rooms was the size of the downstairs floor basically \n<$A> Yeah it was a like a country mansion set in its own grounds and everything I was just sort of well well this is just uh, what period is the house you know And I said well it was built nineteen ten  What 's wrong with you It 's a it 's a it 's a terrace just off Sunnydale Street you know  Do you know them He said well what size is the bay, you know and I sort of said like wall size or something like that <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Oh it was awful I was so mortified\n<$C> I don't think there was any reason to be   The only  reason we were embarrassed was that we couldn't   have afforded anything that he suggested \n<$A>  I know  \n<$A>  We knew we didn't have any   money   at all \n<$B>  There 's never anybody   in there I didn't think that shop was still open\n<$A> Well they they do all their business over the phone it seems cos your man Tom Rothwell was just sitting there in a big plush chair you know   Oh yes yes yes  yes yes yes we can yeah five thousand yes yes\n<$B>  Was he actually there  \n<$C> On the way out there were a couple in, looking for a wall-hanging   I mean  I think that one there was twenty-nine pounds reduced from something, something roughly the same size So he was saying to the couple uh, yes well this one might be more in your range It 's only two to three thousand\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A> Yeah, I know\n<$B> You 're joking\n<$A> Yeah well I mean he 's, we sort of Ted had actually had this idea cos he saw these screens you know and I mean that white screen was lovely It was really you know the one with wee squares in it And I said God that 's an idea I never thought of that So we were uh walking round anyway and we saw these other screens downstairs And we sort of <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> that these were the Japanese screens at about seven hundred pounds or whatever, but they were very very heavily decorated I would have preferred something a bit more plain So I saw these ones in the corner, and they were beautiful It was like sort of, just like a thin cast-iron frame, with   a wee sort of  bobbly thing like And there was fabric stretched from one end to the other, you know so there was gaps in it And it was really really lovely just plain, nice lines in it I said so what about those ones And he said they were fifteen hundred to two   thousand \n<$B>  Iron  \n<$B>  Oh they were   expensive too\n<$A> And I said my, I said what what  And he said it 's because of what, well apparently it 's Japanese or Chinese silk or something that the actual material is   you know and that 's why it 's,  so expensive Yeah   <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> \n<$C>  Aye the frame wasn't expensive \n<$B>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and all  \n<$B>  Well I think   uhm, Spoils had them before They 're wood and paper\n<$A> Well we went   those Spoils  but they only had you know the sort of the the pine stuff the like the the wickerwork And they were charging about sixty pounds for this very shabby-looking wicker type thing\n<$B>  Castle Court  \n<$B> As much as that\n<$A> Yeah I just didn't think it was nice at all But you see that sort of thing just the plain wooden   frame  with uhm thin material, like gauze or something   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>  Yeah I mean   I have seen \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  It works out cheaper  \n<$B>  I 've   seen them somewhere I think it was Spoils Mine was   nice  as well\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Well you see that   Natural Interiors  place it looks as if it 's got some oul rubbish in it cos they have those big  <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>   The Natural Interiors on the Dublin Road\n<$B>  They 're nice  \n<$B>  Where  \n<$B> I never noticed that\n<$A> Yeah well they <unclear> several sylls </unclear> as well\n<$B> They 've nice stuff though\n<$A> Yeah they do They do Maria had sort of done, oh she 's done all the sort of hanging <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> stuff and that wickerwork stuff round the house you know   It 's very nice \n<$B>  Tying stuff   with <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> 's always a bit   strange like \n<$A>  Mm mhm  \n<$C> What about the fireplace What do you think of that\n<$A> Not really\n<$B> Well, I mean I really like this kind of   thing  But I mean, like what do you want I mean there 's, you can have it a big high one\n<$A>  No \n<$C>  No we don't  \n<$A> Uh-huh Do you know what I   want \n<$B>  Like   that line, see that line on the   wall  That could have been the top of the original one\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yeah   No that 's  the damp-proof course\n<$C>  Do you think so  \n<$B> Like you know when, whenever these houses were built   I 'm sure  they were the same as in   our house they  used to be you know ones you could actually walk under\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  I know  \n<$C> Uh-huh\n<$A> Oh God as big   as that \n<$C>  A priest hole   might have been\n<$B> Could 've been \n<$A> But do you know what I would like to do I 'd like to just take the whole thing away And obviously you 'd need a hearth just for fire purposes but uhm, just have a hole-in-the-wall fire, do you know and just   have for an old fireplace And then we 'd just even have  wee, no, no just nothing It 's just miss   frame  here and that 's your fire\n<$B>  Oh that 'd be great yes, All in brick  \n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$C> Are you not going to need to have something on the floor\n<$A> That 's what I 'm saying you 'd need a hearth for fire purposes or   some, some wee , what do you call them stencils about it or something\n<$B>  As long as there 's something, some <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>  \n<$B> And  you just, if you just had like uhm,   brick  the whole thing brick and actually the brick coming out you could use it as like I think it actually went away down and in had the TV and all\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Well I 'm thinking what   else we could do  Yeah I know\n<$B>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$B> Even just for that wee bit the brick with the wee <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> on it\n\n<$B> You 're coming down Sunnydale Street, on your left-hand side, it 's not that far down   And  it 's about the only house that has those kind of curtains   back and it 's \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$C>  Is it Deramore Avenue   or Sunnydale Street\n<$A>   Sunnydale Street \n<$B>  Sunnydale Street   And the bricks are like going right up to the ceiling and it 's all white and bookshelves   and there 's a big <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Yeah uh Actually now I 'd even be tempted   just to paint that, to give it a plain colour   cos \n<$B>  You could   sell that fireplace They are worth a fortune\n<$A> You 're serious\n<$B> Well see when they took ours out, and we didn't get any money for them  , the  Housing Executive took them out And like uh, well the one in the parlour  , that  was very old That was a really nice one It was a bit sort of Art Nouveau and they   took it  That would 've been a packet\n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$C> I wonder is <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> place, What bit is but that that that whole thing 's   the fireplace,  Or just the\n<$B>  That would uhm  \n<$A> Don't know, to be honest with you", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

didn't hear that part of it\n<$A> Well I met her in the gym I met her a couple of times in the gym and she pretended she didn't see me Then one day she did see, like she was literally walking past me and she had to say something, and she went hiya\n<$B> But   she would 've  chatted away to you when you were a pupil wouldn't she\n<$?>  Like that 's  \n<$A> Sure I sat in the same office as her We shared an office and got on, I mean we did get on,   well \n<$B>  Aw she probably   didn't recognise you\n<$A> Huh\n<$B> She probably didn't recognise you\n<$A> Are you being funny\n<$B> Yeah Well I mean if you 're sitting in an office same office with someone for two years of course you 're going to recognise them \n<$A> Oh sorry Right I was going, do you do you think Is it the hair \n<$B> That 's what people say you know when you haven't seen them, or you know oh I didn't recognise you there\n<$A> Mm I don't really understand that one actually I must say uhm so\n<$D> I know because the irony being, I mean we 've all done it You just think I just can't be assed   talking to that  person But it takes more out of you to avoid them   than  it does to say   hello what you doing \n<$A>  Yeah Mm  \n<$A>  Uh-huh  \n<$C>  To actually find out  \n<$B> And keep walking\n<$D> Uh-huh Exactly\n<$A>   But Roisin thinks  I 'm really odd cos if I see people from school who I haven't seen in a while my immediate reaction is to duck into the nearest shop I mean that 's just my reaction\n<$?>  <unclear> 5 syllables </unclear>  \n<$D>   Well you see it 's hard cos \n<$C>  It depends on the person too  \n<$D> You see but it 's  I find it very hard because you 're like all, you invariably have to ask them so what are you   at  or what are you up to And then when they  ask you what are you up to Oh I 'm a solicitor I 've just bought a house blah-de-blah-de-blah they think then that you 've  asked this\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$C>   To tell you, for you to tell them all about you \n<$B>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$D> So I end up saying then like oh I 'm just working away in Belfast So you end up getting nowhere with the conversation anyway cos you 're not telling anything, you 're not   sharing anything <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>  You 'll not get any back, you 're no further forward So hello how are you doing and walk on\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$B> Would you get a lot of that As in like you 're the big girl who 's going to Belfast and has got a plan and career and all this kind of stuff\n<$D> Uhm, from people who don't uh know me, and  But, but it 's actually quite funny because at when I was at that christening last Sunday and there was a  uh Felice 's aunt used to teach in our school, and actually I 'm now realising that it 's not a bad thing you know, just well I, you know I work hard so I think, well I am sort of semi-successful so why should I be putting myself down going, do you know what I mean But it\n<$A>   It it it 's just it wouldn't occur  to the rest of us to even put in the \" semi \" \n<$D>  I end up  \n<$B> You are successful\n<$D> But I end up like over-compensating saying och I 'm just working away Instead of saying yeah work 's going well or whatever But yes, they would\n<$B> But you are always better to underplay it\n<$D> Yes, oh absolutely But you know I do find that it 's all you know oh right and things are going really well and blah-de-blah So   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  And what   do you find when you say you 're practice manager Would you,   would you  use that title\n<$C>  I don't  \n<$C> No, I don't\n<$A> No   What do you \n<$C>  People say  , well people know that I 've been in a solicitors ' for so long now they   just say  are you still in the solicitors ' And I go yeah\n<$?>  Yeah  \n<$A> Oh right Right\n<$B> So you 're actually not even given the chance to say how well you 've done really\n<$C> No there 'd be very few people who 'd know that I 'm\n<$A> Really   That 's a shame \n<$B>  Practice manager  \n<$C> Practice manager\n<$B> Practice manager of one of the biggest commercial law firms in Belfast I mean that 's a job\n<$C> I 'd never say that to anybody\n<$A> I know   well, I couldn't,  I couldn't imagine that you would Being you \n<$?>  Well I just say <unclear> several syllables </unclear>\n<$C> I just work for a solicitors '\n<$A> I know but sometimes it 's easier isn't it\n<$D> Well it is and then if they walk away feeling better that 's grand Sure you know the craic yourself\n<$C> Have to admit it depends on the person   Like  sometimes if you 've got a real   pain in the arse  who is bumming and blowing about what they 've done and all the rest of it you sort of go, well   I  can't stand you anyway so you know if if you ask me what I do I 'll say that I 'm a practice manager you know   It 's  just being really bitchy in that sort of scene or being   really  not   bitchy but, if they 're  if they 're they 're sort of bumming and blowing and you never really got on with them anyway and they 're just really speaking to you because they can't get away from you or they have to\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Pain in the ass  \n<$A>  Wait til you hear  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  No it 's  \n<$A>  No It 's just protecting yourself  \n<$A> Yeah Yeah\n<$D> Well there 's a barrister that was in my class at Queen 's What the hell did you call him Roger Mc, Roger McNamara was it\n<$A> I 'm not sure\n<$D> I can't remember Anyway, nice enough fella, no social skills I don't think He 's one of these very, just so, you know big would be coming, walking with his striped umbrella and oh Sarah, hi Did you ever get into the Institute kind of look  So I met him Wait til you hear this right I met him uhm in the High Court And this can't be that long ago cos it was the time I was doing that absolutely pish <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> petition It was the bane of my life\n<$A> Oh that one Right\n<$D> Uhm So, and that 's was what That must have been either, it must have been just after Christmas I met him And he said uhm, something about where are you working now And I said oh I 'm working in  blah-de-blah And he would be one that I would say you know I 'm working for whoever Thanks Sally-Anne Uhm and he 's all oh yes so uh yes you were you know a couple of years behind the rest of us going to the Institute weren't you And I said yes but I actually worked in a smaller firm and it was invaluable  you know experience and actually it stood to me very well Sure I always say things work out for a reason I says so it worked out grand So that was dead-on Now I must make the point three or four weeks ago I was coming back from lunch you know up Queen Street so I was at those traffic lights opposite the Centra, and I saw him and I thought I can't be arsed talking to you But he was waiting to cross the fucking lights as well So I was standing with the mobile phone and all out And I could see him like going, you know, looking like this just to make sure it was me, Sarah Och Roger how are you doing\n<$C> And you were coming across so sort of, you know, as if you weren't really   trying to ignore  him\n<$A>  Genuine, yeah  \n<$B> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Hello Uh I haven't just just been looking at you for the last ten minutes\n<$D> Now wait This was a classic How are things going Sarah I said things are going very well Roger What about yourself He says oh I 'm just off to buy a leather jacket Right I said oh very good Are you still at  I said I am He says yes I think the last time I was speaking to you you were training I said eight months ago I said I 've now been qualified for three years and in fact actually I 've just been promoted  I thought you bastard   You  know, real stuck up So I mean I wouldn't be a bit behind the door in that sort of thing\n<$A>  Mm  \n<$B> You should say something like are you still doing really low-quality bar work\n<$D> I said   uh \n<$A>  Bastard   Exactly What a git\n<$D> Well\n<$B> I mean, how stupid You 'll never instruct him\n<$A> Yes Well   exactly \n<$D>  Precisely  , So then we were crossing the road at this stage and he says yes I 'm just going to buy He must have been going to Diesel or somewhere to look at this leather jacket He said I 've decided you know I may go get in with the fashion and uh, something about trendy anyway I said listen Roger, it takes a hell of a lot more than a leather jacket to make somebody trendy\n<$A>   Ooh \n<$B>  Ooh \n<$C>  Ooh  \n\n<$D> Now I 'm not, I wasn't, I was   like,  it takes a hell of a lot more than a leather jacket but sure

bad\n<$A>  Can't describe the depths\n\n<$B> Okay Let 's talk about proportion\n\n<$D> I was in Provincetown Were you never in Provincetown\n<$E>  Is that a gay suburb in \n\n<$D> Provincetown in uhm, Provincetown north of Boston This guy brought us there Uh he was plying drink on us The whole place was given over to gay people Gay and lesbian people And uh\n<$E>  Is it Cape Cod, is it Cape Cod Provincetown \n<$D> Yeah   Provincetown yeah \n<$E>   Oh I 've been in Provincetown   \n\n<$D> It 's the sort of place where you see these guys all wearing leather gear you know and they 've chains on them You see men dressed as women And uhm he had arranged to meet us in this, like a club\n<$E>  What you \n\n<$D> There were four or five of us We were drinking in the place and uh, I noticed these people walking hand-in-hand past us They were similar, same sex, people walking in There was music and dancing\n<$A> I like the way you nearly said similar sex there\n<$F> I know \n<$D> But the females, the females went off, females went off into one room and the males went off into another\n<$A> Really\n<$D> Yeah The funny thing was\n<$?> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n\n<$A> All standing looking at each other\n<$D> And then these guys try to you know they try to get you in to\n<$E>  Discos, sparkly ballroom \n<$D> One of the guys, you see we were sitting at the bar drinking and one of the guys was balding you see and he was leaning back like and this guy kissed him on the head\n<$A> Oh no\n<$D> He was livid\n<$A> I 'm sure he was\n<$D> He was raging So that was Provincetown We got out of it fast\n\n<$A> Oh God\n<$F> And who 's this that had played the trick on you\n<$D> It was a chap that we, we stayed with over there in Boston\n<$F> Right There 's a lot to be said for reading your guidebook\n<$D> Hmm\n<$F> There 's a lot to be said for reading your guidebook\n<$D> Oh there is We were totally innocent But it 's a well-known place actually\n<$G> Yeah there was somebody <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and she lived there for like six months or something as part of the community <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> And, the place is actually called Provincetown rather   than the pub \n<$D>  It 's Provincetown   No it 's Provincetown it 's called\n<$A> Right Oh I thought that \n<$E>  <unclear> several words </unclear> \n<$D> It 's strange how a town like that, it 's strange how it 's totally devoted to this kind of thing now\n<$F> Then maybe if people don't want to be so overtly gay in in a major city because of the discrimination it 's   maybe easier for them to go \n<$D>  Well that poor guy,   that poor guy was killed here because of it\n<$A>   But I think it 's awful it has  to be so closet here\n<$F>  You don't know that though do you  \n<$D> Hmm\n<$F> You don't know that\n<$A> It must be though They must be very sure of it because of   the way it was  reported and stuff\n<$F>  Aye but they can't really say  \n<$H> Yeah <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> But because of the way the newspaper articles are written, I think they must, you know they must be fairly sure But I think it 's awful that people have to be so covert here I mean if you walk through Soho in London and there are men holding hands and just, you know, it 's just normal People just get on with it\n<$D> Yeah but there 's a hell of a religious background here,   you know that it would be, it 's hard to overcome \n<$A>  Oh I know that I know  \n\n<$A> It 's quite sad,\n<$F> Probably a bit too close to home as well\n<$A> Aye Especially for   me  Round the corner\n<$F>  Yeah  \n<$D> Och no but you wouldn't worry about that\n<$F> No but at the same time it 's, there 's been more and more things in South Belfast You know <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>   and stuff \n<$D>  Murders and things   Aye Yeah\n<$H> That 's what I was saying you know about to you earlier, the guy in our garden last year\n<$A> A guy in your garden\n<$D>   Yeah \n<$H>  A guy   that was murdered and he was in our back, in our rear yard\n<$A> Oh I didn't realise that that was so close   to you \n<$H>  Mhm   Yeah We were overlooking it cos the night,   I went out to put  out my bins one night and he would 've been lying in, in the bushes\n<$D>  They got someone for it though  \n<$A>    Oh no \n<$F>  Imagine  \n<$H> And I had no idea\n<$F> That 's desperate\n<$A> Oh that 's a horrible thought\n<$H> But they 're clearing that all out now They 've diggers and everything in it, you know, to clear it except it 's really heavy vegetation and like that 's where he was found But then again though, then the house across which is like Serpentine Avenue <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$F> Aye and then it was burnt down\n<$H> I can't remember, cos I was, cos I wasn't in Belfast when it happened   It was around Christmas  time\n<$D>  What was burnt down  \n\n<$D> They tried to burn the house\n<$H> They tried to burn the house or something\n<$D> Oh right\n<$H> But I think there was that much damage they 've knocked the house down and rebuilt it or gutted it or something\n\n<$A> I always wondered what happened to that house you remember that that girl Maria McConnell was murdered in\n<$F>   Yeah \n<$H>  Mhm  \n<$A> I wonder were they ever able to\n<$H> Was that the Holy Lands one\n<$A>   Yeah \n<$F>  Yeah  \n<$F> I remember talking to someone one night who lived next door and, you know when the whole thing had happened and they, they moved out   They  just didn't want to be there\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Horrible thought, But I wonder, I mean, you 'd think that they might just have to pull the house down because who really would want to live there\n<$?> Yeah\n<$D> People forget though You 'd get students who would go into it   They wouldn't know \n<$F>  But it 'll turn into   you know sort of one of those things that 'll never be talked about\n<$H> I think students would move into the house\n<$D> Yeah I think they would I think <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$G> Then again just because something bad happened there doesn't necessarily, you know\n<$F> Yeah but would you want to be living in it\n<$A> I 'm not superstitious but I would not want to live in, or I would not want to have as a bedroom a room where someone had been brutally murdered\n<$G> No I suppose\n<$A> The   thought of what went on in that room \n<$D>  Why do you believe in ghosts  \n<$A> Uhm, well I don't not believe in ghosts I don't know I mean some very sensible people have told me that they 've seen ghosts I hope to God I never see one \n<$F> I thought I saw one one time\n<$D> Did you\n<$F> Yeah It was ridiculous It was probably just a trick of light   But we were sitting in , yeah, in Donnybrook Street and we had an upstairs flat and\n<$?>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$D> Donnybrook Donnybrook, that 's down off the Lisburn Road yeah\n<$F> It is yeah, yeah, uhm, but it had a big bay window and there was one of the chairs sort of sat facing the bay window and I never sat in that chair I always sat on the sofa And this one night I was sitting there I never pull the curtains And all the girls\n<$D> Were you sitting in the dark\n<$F> No no I was sitting watching TV And all the girls were sitting there and they were all chatting away and then I looked up and looked in the window and over my right shoulder there was somebody standing behind me I looked round, oh my God   and then turned round and there was nothing there  I could see it in the window but there was obviously, I mean it was a trick of the light\n<$D>  You could see the window You could see the reflection in the window  \n\n<$D> What did the person look like What did the person look like\n<$F> I don't know I just know it was a figure standing behind me I didn't you know I didn't look long enough to see\n\n<$D> Yeah, It could have been somebody standing outside then\n<$F> No cos we were on the first floor You know we didn't\n<$D> Oh right Right\n<$H> I think your mind plays tricks\n<$F> Yeah\n<$A> See I always\n<$D> I don't know about that\n\n<$A> Always close the curtains Never look in the mirror after twelve o'clock\n\n<$A> I 'm always waiting for someone to pop their head up behind me when I 'm brushing my teeth at night \n<$D> But would you be worried\n<$F> Would you be worried Yeah\n<$D> They don't do any harm to anybody do they\n<$F> What Ghosts\n<$A> I always felt better about it after uhm you know the Bruce Willis film\n<$F>   Oh yeah \n<$H>  Sixth Sense  \n<$A> Because they were actually all\n<$F> Nice   ghosts \n<$A>  They were all nice   They just were a bit troubled\n\n<$A> Och no well she was just troubled you know she was just looking for some kind of resolution\n<$I> I know what you mean They weren't these evil spirits\n<$A> Yeah\n<$F> Yeah\n<$A> I always felt a bit better after watching that\n<$H> I 'd be more scared of a real person than a ghost to be honest, you know\n<$A> Yeah\n<$H>   If there was somebody in my house \n<$D>  Yeah Quite right", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d38e7d55-0d75-4782-8b36-d35d10217d9e", "added":

{"text": "<Postgrad study>\n\n\n<$A> So  were you in today just asking about this\n<$B> Did you both say tea\n<$A> Yes\n<$C> Yeah No he I had got the Forum 's money\n<$A> Uh-huh\n<$C> Sent me this thing to say that, I was in the top lot of the reserve list\n<$A> Mhm\n<$C> And a DENI form\n<$A> Mhm\n<$C> And I 'd to fill out the DENI form and I didn't, exactly know who to give it to   So  and there were a few other questions that I had about, cos it says in the thing that you 're registered for a Masters\n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A> Mhm\n<$C> And then you want to do a   PhD And I didn't know what  to put down Masters it says what is the, uhm, what type of degree or what type of qualification will you be registering for\n<$A>  Yeah and the standard down  \n<$A> Mhm\n<$C> And that sort of, I didn't know   whether that was \n<$A>  But you do   register for Masters first and then you change and register for the PhD\n<$C> Yes but the funny thing is on the form, not to confuse the DENI sort of   administration , you actually put down PhD because that 's what you will be in the   future \n<$A>  Mm  \n<$C>  Ultimately   doing\n<$B>   Yes yes \n<$C>  Ultimately   doing\n<$A> Well not unless you 're actually <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> and get knocked back\n<$B> What 's he only doing the Masters now\n<$C> No no Well he might be if they if they say he isn't good enough\n<$B> Really\n<$C> And does he think it mightn't be\n<$A> Well he didn't get a very good impression from, do you remember a few months ago\n<$C> No\n<$A> He was   he had  his, They have\n<$B>  He tried  \n<$C> To have a first draft in or something\n<$A> No yeah the first few chapters and then that 's how they decide if you go on to the PhD or not  , from  how well you 're getting on And they didn't think it was very good and he sort of had to start from the beginning again\n<$C>  Oh right  \n<$B> How many more years has he to do\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> How many more years like  how much time has he left\n<$A>   He 's \n<$C>  You 'd   wonder how far wrong you could go\n<$A> No it 's that 's the thing It does seem very poor that they let them go on so far   before the first bit of criticism \n<$B>  Yeah yeah   yeah\n<$A> Mhm And then do you know what they do\n<$C> See that 's the problem with PhDs if they 're always saying you you 're not given enough supervision   Like if you 've finished your degree , you know it 's a big big difference\n<$A>  Yeah I think especially  \n<$A> Mhm Especially I think in, some of the politics I heard people complaining about, who the supervisors are   Because  it 's different than science cos you 're actually working with someone Aren't you\n<$C>  Mhm  \n<$C> Yeah but like at the same time <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> was saying, the guy he 's doing his PhD well wants to do his PhD with, doesn't have much communication with them And like, the two people that are doing the PhD with him at the minute, one of them has seen him for the first time after fourteen months and the other 's seen him for the first time after sixteen months, which is an awful long time\n<$A> So they 're not actually doing research that, that person wants done They 're just sort of working by themselves doing it\n<$C> Oh no, , I think the difference with maybe sort of things like, sociology, and, geology you know, you know approaches to things, are pretty much, a matter of form, whereas like say with, , well biochemical stuff like I mean you could take a variety of approaches to sort of, sort out things\n<$A>  In sociology there 's only one way to go   about it No that 's nonsense \n<$C>  No no no I know this   yeah I mean that 's the point of the research But there 's lots of, uhm, like I mean say if you were going to analyse a, a rock face I mean there 's probably only one way you can actually analyse it\n<$A> Uh-huh\n<$C> Whereas if you were going to make a gene,   if you were going to change genes \n<$A>  So that so you mean  , that by that that they can work better by themselves, cos they don't need so much help\n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> But then I 'm what I 'm saying is, people like Nathan doing politics, I mean he 's just I don't think he, his thesis 's on the UN Now he doesn't have to do any research for that What he 's doing, well,   he has to do research He doesn't do any research himself \n<$C>  He does that, yeah He doesn't   produce any results himself\n<$A> No\n<$C> Right\n<$A> He 's just, analysing, different things   like as if he was doing  a PhD in history\n<$C>  Yeah yeah  \n<$C> And it 's actually his own, personal sort of uh ability to write things up\n<$A> Uh-huh but the thing is you still, the reason you need supervision is to be given direction to know what way to go and to be said ways to go about this way this way   because you \n<$C>  Or what   avenues you should,   research  further   Mhm \n<$A>  Uh-huh yeah  \n<$A>  Mhm  , Anna Crowley 's is more of a scientific one so she actually has to go along do interviews and then,   do her  own research\n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$C> Yeah Oh well I suppose I mean if you were going to do that conflict resolution one you would have to sort of take\n<$B> There you go\n<$A> Why is there a PhD in conflict resolution\n<$C> No but your man who was doing research into conflict resolution like I mean I 'm sure you could do a PhD   in \n<$A>  Which   man was doing research in   conflict resolution \n<$C>  Uh, the   Serbian guy you were talking about He wasn't doing research   He was , over here with the UN and he was in Newcastle Wasn't it Newcastle\n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> No he was in Birmingham and he   wasn't with the UN  \n<$C>  Right  , Right he   wasn't \n<$A>  He was   lecturing\n<$C> Right\n<$A> But he was doing, I think he was lecturing on this kind of thing and he was   doing \n<$C>  See   how it could uh be like Western conflict resolution\n<$A> Mhm\n<$C> Uhm   theories  how they would   integrate  into, Serbian   culture \n<$A>  No not  \n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A>  Yes   Eastern European   sort of yeah \n<$C>  Yeah so   I mean like, I suppose you could get direction in what type, okay you would need a certain, sample of conflict resolution theories\n<$A> Yes\n<$C> And then you would need uhm, information on culture\n<$A> Mhm\n<$C> Or\n<$A> Yes I know what you mean That 's <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$B> Yeah He was saying over at Dominic 's Sorry to talk about something so much  less, important   Uhm no , no the guy in lives down the stairs in the flat downstairs in Angela 's house,  his girlfriend 's called Dominic There was a phonecall for her the other night,   and I said that \n<$A>  <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>  \n<$A>  Mhm Dominique   Dominic\n<$B> No but,  just call her   Dominic \n<$C>  Dominic  ,\n<$A> Dominic is that not the masculine\n<$B> But they just called her Dominic\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> And I thought there was another man living downstairs And he said no It 's a girl now, And I said oh is that not a man 's name And he didn't seem to think so Well I suppose it 's sort of a very  Catholicy name isn't it\n<$A> Mm\n<$C> Dominic\n<$B> Dominic yeah Saint Dominic\n<$A> Oh right\n<$C> I don't know Maybe Dominique is just some kind of,   posh \n<$B>  No   but,   no it 's not No it 's  like Dominique, ique on the end you know   when  you put E on the end of something it 's   makes  it   feminine \n<$A>  Well it 's not  \n<$C>  Yeah

everything I don't think there 's anything wrong with it I think my voice is fine And, uh but it 's supposed to be her flatmate, or her the girl that shared a room with her moved out because of her voice Now obviously there was a lot more to the girl leaving than just her   voice  And it was really embarrassing cos you 'd this girl stood up and she had a really deep voice and she was saying oh Christy really  used to annoy me and everything And and Oprah says oh did you leave specifically because of her voice And she said uhm, well yeah among other things And it was obvious then it was the

authoritive And she was saying well I can make my voice authoritive if I want to And she could, speak you know more slowly and make her voice deeper  , and  everything And he was going but you can get deeper than that You can get deeper than that   But she was saying  well it 's fine And he was saying now say right right And she was going right right And he was going good And she was going but that

They had been lying out on the uhm mountains around Belfast whatever There was a Divis was it or\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> They 'd been lying out there and they had no home and they 'd no nothing and they hadn't even water to wash And we took three of them in And uh my sister and my Nancy Auntie Nan she, uh took them all upstairs and we got a big , you know with the old steam   baths  We filled those up fill it with water for them and we put them in and scrubbed them, and gave them nice clean beds   We 'd  an awful job that and those nights was terrible\n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Right How long were they here for\n<$B> Oh they stayed for weeks\n<$A> Right\n<$B> Finally they got tired and wanted to go back to their city life you know\n<$A> Yeah Suppose it would be quiet, would it  So did you ever keep in touch with them or\n<$B> Uh for a while and then they faded out\n<$A> Right right\n<$B> But they were in every house around you know   They  were in all the, all the neighbours had them\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Were you asked to actually take children or\n<$B> Huh\n<$A> Were you actually asked to take children   or did you offer \n<$B>  Oh yes yes   yeah The I think it would have been the Council <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> who come out There was two or three days I went round myself\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Alice Dunne and I went round the we went right up to your granny 's\n<$A> Right\n<$B> But she wasn't having ay  anything\n<$A> Right  Wouldn't take them\n<$B> They didn't go over to your house I don't whether you 'd 've taken them or not\n<$A> \n<$B> I don't know if we got a lot of people round Newtown\n<$A> Yeah   where everybody was taken in \n<$B>  Very good   Very good And we got quite a good reception You know they nearly all well they knew all, they knew some of us   in  most of the houses you know, where there was young people running about to dances and things   they  knew who we were And we cycled all round Newtown up to the border and all round there, back down into Maguire 's Bridge and out in the country Tom McMurray 's uh, they had uh they had four\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Uh-huh\n<$B> And Mrs Knowles had two beside us And uhm now I don't know who else would have had them I think there  was there was very few houses escaped You see you more or less had to take them\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> You can't leave them out\n<$A> So what the were you given any money for taking them and to keep or to keep them or did you have to   take it all out of your own pocket \n<$B>  Mm, no we got so much We got little,   we didn't get very much\n<$A> Right right\n<$B> And they were ravenous They were starving\n<$A> Yeah\n\n\n<$A> Do you remember the first day of the war\n<$D> I remember coming home from school I was a pupil in Enniskillen at the time and my mother said to me, they 've declared war and they 're still playing music on the radio And she seemed a bit horrified that this was all happening at the same time as a war was going to start \n<$A> Right right Was there, what what would 've been the effect on, the whole say for example Newtownbutler Was there, was there a general sort of outcry or was is all taken in people 's   stride or \n<$D>  Well now  , I can't really remember exactly what happened apart from that because I spent most of my day out of the village\n<$A> Right\n<$D> And then when I came home I had homework to do and I didn't see much of the other people apart from holiday times\n<$A> Right right So well, then after the war started uhm what effects did it would it have had upon social life in the town\n<$B> Well before the war there wasn't a great deal of social life here But when the soldiers arrived, the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> arrived in Crumlin, at the uh soon after the beginning of the war They 'd been in Dunkerque and they were supposed to have a rest cure in Crum\n<$A> Right right\n<$D> So, they arrived and they lived in Nissen huts, which weren't awfully comfortable no doubt and the officers lived in the castle And, after that they had dances in what is now the Community Centre in Newtownbutler It was then called the Courthouse So, all the local girls of course flocked to the dances \n<$A> Yeah\n<$D> And the social life began to wake up   Well  after about nine months then they departed I think they went to Madagascar after that, and a lot of them were killed out there I don't know,   what \n<$A>  Right right  \n<$A>  Do   people actually keep in touch with\n<$D> Not now   no We  did keep in touch with some of them but not any more\n<$A>  Oh right  \n<$A> Right\n<$D> So then, after that they were followed by the Berkshire Regiment, and they again had dances And I think some of them were held at the riding school at Crum And after they left the Americans arrived, because America came into the war after Pearl Harbor\n<$A> Right\n<$D> And that was some time after the actual beginning of the war So then they again, uh uh lived out in the Nissen huts But during this time, uh between the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and the Americans, a lot of them used to come into Lurganboy House and they played tennis on the tennis what was then the tennis court It was flat but I 'm afraid it isn't flat any longer  But anyway they did play tennis and then we had a few spare rackets\n<$A> Right\n<$D> And they really enjoyed themselves And my mother used to make steak and kidney pies, which seemed to stretch and stretch according to the amount of gravy that was put in\n<$A> Right\n<$D> Because uh the meat was rationed, and butter was rationed and margarine was rationed, and there were very few cakes or anything And sweets were rationed at the time So whatever they got had to be more or less basic But they seemed to have enjoyed their visits\n<$A> Right right\n<$B> Uh\n<$A> Basically they were almost like taken in as family almost\n<$B> Well that was it   Yes  So in between times I did my homework \n<$A>  Yeah yeah  \n<$A> Nice to fit it in you know\n<$B> Yes It had to be fitted in as well\n<$A> Right right\n<$B> Now what else can I remember Oh yes there was a canteen The what is now the Church Hall, had a marketplace underneath where they, graded eggs and the actual Church Hall was, it was then called the Parochial Hall was above the place where they grade the eggs\n<$A> Mhm\n<$D> And we played badminton up there And the Johnson family had a canteen And a Mrs Kerr who lived somewhere real near Clontivrin, uh ran the canteen and several other local people helped So the army used to come in and they were supplied with Paris buns  Some of the local people made cakes and provided food and they had sausages, and uh again there was entertainment of some kind up there\n<$A> Right\n<$D> But it made a social gathering  , and  we got to know quite a few of these people And apart from the army, there was an  airforce base up at Killaroo   That 's  where Geoffrey Lewis now lives   lives  That 's all been dismantled\n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Mhm yeah", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b4b8b29f-df1c-4e51-8ed8-0e18b5f409eb", "added":

Stormont Hotel is\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B> Mhm\n<$A> Sort of, or do you not\n<$B> I know where it is\n<$A> Right And there 's a couple of streets there There 's only two that are nice But there 's some\n<$B> Two streets or two houses\n<$A> Two streets Two streets that are quite nice, all with nice houses in them And the one that I saw a house in was Castleview Road it 's   called  And there 's another one beside it called uhm Knockburn Park or something like that and it 's my favourite they had nothing for sale Castleview Road had two houses for sale It was one, one of them was, uhm well they were both three-bedroomed semis but one of them was new and one of them was old And the one that I liked best was an old, the older one  , and  I looked it up on the internet and it 's a hundred and ten thousand\n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B> Oh very good\n<$A> Uhm, yeah three bedrooms, three bedrooms totally double-glazed, uh oil-fired central heating and uh, what else did it

needed a new roof\n<$B> Why What do you mean If the roof isn't good, that 's like a very important part of any house you buy\n<$A> Is that right\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> I think the the roof is in in sound order\n<$B> Why are you taking the piss\n<$A> I 'm not Well why have you just mentioned the roof suddenly It 's not that old a house\n<$B> Cos you said it  there was a new house and there was an old house and you liked the old house\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Well from that it sounds like it was older than like in the last twenty years, in which case the roof may be dodgy\n<$A> No I 'd say the roof was fine I 'd say the roof was more than fine But I thought, I thought that price was quite good   compared to \n<$B>  That   is good\n<$A> Well compared to other places in east Belfast and compared to places in south Belfast Plus because of the fact that\n<$B> Sit there\n<$A> But that 's close to you know the Ulster Hospital\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> So you could get it rented out I 'd say fairly easily and it 's got a good bus route there and uhm it 's nice and close to everything And it 's close to shops too\n<$B> Right\n<$A> So I told Davy about it and I think he 's going round to see it\n<$B> What,

probably be\n<$B> Uhm and she said, oh my God he 'd love that And we looked at the price It was three thousand and something\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> And uh, like three thousand eight hundred And there was another one at four  four thousand two hundred and something\n<$A> Mm I know it 's <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>\n<$B> And I said would you let Roy spend that amount of, or would Roy spend that amount of money on a TV And she said, something not very pleasant I don't know what she said actually She said yeah he would And then I asked her would she let him, and she said no\n<$A> There was actually a

</unclear> oh there 's Molly Murphy\n<$B> There 's only two practical points that I see in it And one is yes in this day and age everywhere should be accessible to   uh the  disabled handicapped, whatever whatever And the second point is it 's badly in need of, a carpet, something done or whatever Now they couldn't put a wooden one in because you 'd just get a wet day and coming in there, and elderly people would go skidding on   their heads in it \n<$A>  Wheelchairs  \n<$A>  They need to get those uh   carpet tiles and if they are destroyed they can be lifted\n<$B> Aye at the door bit That 's right\n<$C> Sure those alcoholics could come into thon corner and they twist up and twist down that much You know what I mean\n<$D> Sure nobody 's there uh uh during the day that would stop

the place, he says it was unbelievable he says now, but they had a tackle to get that cleaned up\n<$C> Well I mean if a man was going to stand and piss on you would you go up and say stop piddling  He 'd turn and piddle on you\n<$B> If he was in that mood he would have piddled on you\n<$D> Do you know those\n<$C> Pat McCartan and I threw him out\n<$B> Aye\n<$C> Pat McCartan and me because he was

 Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> I know well   you would  but at the end of the day I mean\n<$A>  Saying no  \n<$A> There 's eight people like   you know \n<$B>  That it 's   far too many people and   too many for \n<$A>  It 's too   many for, my table anyway you know\n<$B> People 'll understand that   It  wasn't the meal that you planned I mean if you were going to do a buffet or you know   just snack

inviting my mum and dad and my aunties and uncles and all round for dinner   <unclear> 2 syllables </unclear>  That 's just madness,   You  couldn't do that\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah

middle bit in\n<$A> Yeah   Yes I wouldn't have  that but That 's just like\n<$B>  But you wouldn't be able  \n<$B> You wouldn't be able to move in the kitchen   Do  you know what I mean\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> I 'm just trying to think where I 'm going to get two more chairs from\n<$B> You can take two   from my  house\n<$A>  Got some  \n<$A> Have you any foldaway chairs or\n<$B> No they 're just the big wooden ones\n<$A> Yeah Then there 's no point then No I don't want you, carrying it I just   maybe I 'll  ask upstairs or something like that and see if they 've any,   I can borrow  a couple of, chairs or\n<$B>  Are you sure  \n<$B>  Aye spare ones  \n<$B> Is that the two guys that were at the   party \n<$A>  Yeah   yeah But then just as I was leaving uh there was a wee email sign and I clicked on it and it was Angie again going, oh can you can you make it at ten o'clock because, you know I A/ine doesn't finish work til nine   and then I 've to go , uh he 's to go and pick her up and bring her back so that 'll be ten, kind of thing And I was like well that 's a bit late for and it kind of solved my problem of, of having too many people  anyway\n<$B>  Och well then  \n<$B> It did actually didn't it\n<$A> But, I mean if it 's going to be late for everybody\n<$B> Are you   sure now \n<$A>  Just Linda and   Aidan when they get home from work they want they practically eat immediately So if they 're going to   be hanging  around   til \n<$B>  Oh right  \n<$B>  Oh   that 'll not be fair on them\n<$A> But you know what They could have, we could all have our starters you know, in two different sittings or  you know   and that  would, cut out hassle and all as well like\n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B> Yeah yeah true\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> And that would sort of keep them going until   the main course \n<$A>  Yeah   yeah\n<$B> Yeah well that would be fair yeah,   Cos I mean you wouldn't  want them two sitting starving That wouldn't be fair on   him  especially after Linda   made the dessert and everything \n<$A>  I 'm going to do  \n<$A>  No  \n<$A>  But they 're quite  , they 're happy to do that at the moment like   anyway  because uhm, I told Linda on Monday that I was thinking of moving out And   she 's \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  Oh   how did she take that\n<$A> She was fine about it you know She was just going but why  you know and she 's like trying to  you know she was very reasonable and all like, she 's just you know going well obviously I don't want you to move out like You know   we 're  best friends and you know, I hate to think it was, Aidan, being there   or  you know And I was going well obviously Linda it 's changed the whole makeup of the house   It used to be all girls  He 's there all the time\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah I suppose he 's there a lot now is he  \n<$B> Is he\n<$A> Yeah You don't even get speaking to Linda\n<$B> Oh without Aidan   being around \n<$A>  No no   So\n<$B> Mm I know Doris got pissed off with Tommy being in the house\n<$A> Yeah Och it just happens   It 's not , that you don't like them   or anything you know  but it just happens\n<$B>  It does I mean  \n<$B>  I know I know  \n<$B> And uh but even with Doris ' situation I mean like she owned the house Do you know what I mean And she sort of felt like he was,   intruding  almost cos Tommy would 've come round whenever I wasn't there, or I would 've been going to work and he would 've been still in bed and then going on later   I mean he never did anything wrong \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah that was the same with Murph   you see, Cos Murph was there for fucking months on end as well   But  uhm, he, like he never asked to stay and he never you know, I never asked him to either like   you know  With Linda it was all official and above board but Murph was just like slinking He was there all the time He used the house more than us like  He 's getting out of bed when I came home from work looking for his breakfast \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> No way Jesus No well at least if Tommy was staying there all day dinner would 've been ready like for everybody coming home I mean he always did his own share and like cleaned   and everything  But still, whenever, you 're sort of agreeing to   move  in with somebody you sort of just agree to move in with them   You expect \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  But I was just   explaining it like you know look I just need a big change I just want a lot of things in my life to change   at the  moment And I want to be down near the city centre, where I can walk out my front door go visiting,   you know  not be paying a tenner return in a taxi, anywhere any night You know cos as soon as you go up home, and you 're that far out you don't want to leave   Like you know  that 's you you know\n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  No I know  \n<$B> Although in saying that I mean I only live like, down   the road  and I still don't go out anywhere   Well I  have to say no, like if I 'm there on a Friday  or a Thursday evening I 'll go late night shopping just to even wander round   the shops  and see people   Do  you know what I mean\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  I know  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> I 'd, never think of doing that like you know\n<$B> But it I mean, I don't get out because it 's safe as well   Do you know what I mean  Hamill Street 's quite dark   cos  you don't really go out after nine o'clock I wouldn't go out after nine o'clock on my own, And I wouldn't   dream of walking about \n<$A>  Yeah, yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  You got a taxi up here   tonight did you\n<$B> Mm hm, In the lighter evening I can't wait til the lighter evenings to come in You know would you believe\n<$A> I know you 're\n<$B> Look uh it 's light it 's light It 's I don't care  Uhm, you see in the lighter evenings I mean it 'll be great cos I will be able to walk about and stuff, if it 's I think it 's possibly because I don't really know the area very well either\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> You know if I knew it was safe, I know the people that lived there before me said it was safe\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> But still\n<$A> But they were trying to sell their house   you know  But I think it is Well it is that walkway across that 's that part is not safe\n<$B>  Exactly  \n<$B> Aye College Street North the   big street \n<$A>  Yes  , yes   Cos that 's  where the the tech was and all And I remember like the, uh I went there for, for that mechanics course like and uh   it was  you know everybody was always saying like you know it 's a really dodgy area and, especially when we went round to the wee uh garage  yard bit and all Uh you know   they were  going don't like you know   don't hang around  Yeah wait Don't come down early Like wait til it 's open   actually open like \n<$B>  I know  \n<$B>  Oh yes  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Don't go round there on your own  \n<$B>  Yeah  , well it 's that 's fair enough cos I mean   there are  so many wee alleys Do you know what I  There 's  I mean like there 's, the one, before my street, you know the way there 's like a driveway into the   mill  And then there 's the carpark that they could be hiding behind different things and then   there 's  Hamill Street alleyway as well And plus the other thing is that   uhm \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  It 's   like once it 's light you 'll be fine\n<$B> Yeah Oh God aye   you 'll be  able to see everything   Uhm , I 'm not really looking forward to the homeless shelter being open now I felt so   <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  It mightn't   affect you too much like cos it is\n<$B> It is I know it 's on   the main road \n<$A>  Quite a distance   away from you but, that would be dodgy enough now\n<$B> Like it 's people I don't want people, this sounds awful but I don't want people like lying in my alley Do you know what I mean And   going  to my bin in the morning and   there 's  somebody lying beside   it  That scares me a bit\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> But maybe we 're, sort of\n<$B> But there is gates and I would assume   that \n<$A>  Under  , under-judging them or whatever the word is   Like cos  you know,   if their homeless  shelter 's there why would they be lying in your alley like  They 'd go home like\n<$B>  I know  \n<$B>  But <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>  \n<$B> I know And I keep having these thoughts oh no I 'm going to come home   from work \n<$A>  No but   obviously they 're all they they 're probably majority of them are drunks or   whatever  so they would be hanging around like you know close to\n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B> I know\n<$A> They 'll find somewhere to hang out which will be probably your walkway or something like that, you know\n<$B> I hope not\n<$A> Well that 's where all the wee kids hang out and all\n<$B> Like wee kids tend to hang out at you know the very top of the street at   College , North   At the  you know at that end No Not at the bottom end

it was really bad I 'd have no choice but go home But if it wasn't too bad if I was sort of in in and out of jobs like, I would, I would sort of make an attempt to stay as long as I could you know\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> Needn't go rushing back home\n<$A> What sort of a timeframe do you see yourself staying out there\n<$B> It 's like everything else like, you could go there and, get landed into some big job and you could set up a house and\n<$A> And maybe stay for the rest of your life\n<$B> Stay for the rest of your life You know meet some, some Australian girl\n<$A> Would you go illegal You 'd have to\n<$B> What do you mean go illegal\n<$A> You 'd have no Green Card\n<$B> What do you mean See that 's another thing I don't know about you see\n<$A> You see Australia has very stringent immigration laws\n<$B> Yeah well what 's the maximum uh term you could stay there\n<$A> Six months I think\n<$B> And then you have to come home Or how do you get your Green Card\n<$A> Well there 's, there 's certain ways of going about it You can apply for one or else if you marry an Australian, you get a Green Card You can also get it if you 're working over there\n<$B> You see, six months like, that 's the sort of, that 's the sort of uh, time that I would want to stay you know I 'd I 'd I want to stay a year at the least, just to make an impression you know, just to say I was there for a year\n<$A> Do you know anybody that was over there for a year\n<$B> Uh, I do But they couldn't get jobs They says, all over the country they were applying for jobs <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> They got a car They bought a car They said they met a boy in a pub, says that fruit picking or something like that there, but it was on the other side of Australia, three hundred mile away more So they bought a an oul stink of a car with their last bean Right  They went up they went up to this this place anyway Ended up there was no job That was them stuck They 'd no money, they 'd an oul banger of a car\n<$A> And stuck in this place\n<$B> Stuck, stuck in the\n<$A> No money for a fare home or anything\n<$B> And the people that they were over with, that they knew well from   Camlough  they, sort of knew, things were sort of tight you know and they knew who their friends were there you see   Because  there was so many things going on you know And then, they were working and they wouldn't give them money and, wouldn't feed them or nothing And these boys were nearly starving like They  they were starving actually cos I was talking to them And they came back home, and told us all about it about how they met these people really these people were   and  how they let them down, you know\n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> That 's usually what happens when you 're against the wall\n<$B> Yeah and it 's your problem\n<$A> But does that not put you off\n<$B> It did like, It does surely Uh you know, but see even my brother over in America, he was, he was stuck with no house or nothing to go to Like he slept out rough for a day, one week   until  a a girl D'Arcy brought him in He was shitting himself He didn't know what to do   He was over  in a different country in this big massive city, didn't know what was going on or nothing, nowhere to stay, was promised all this here and, nowhere to stay, no nothing just came through at all\n<$A>  You 're joking  \n<$A>  Why was he so  \n<$A> Why was he so unprepared\n<$B> See he thought he was going over there and, he was going over to stay in somebody 's house and, things was all organised They weren't half organised as they thought they were So our Phil was dying to get away and that So they they  planned nearly a month before it, you know But sure whenever he went over there everything just went into a big flop Nothing really planned at all Good good enough for your girl, she brought him in like She fed and watered him til he did get himself back on his feet But now now he is, now he 's got his own apartment, got a girl and all over there a girlfriend\n<$A> American\n<$B> She 's not American She 's from Cork And uhm he 's got a good job Well he hasn't a good job he 's got, he it 's not a good job but it 's good money But the worst thing with jobs in different countries is that you 're  you 're not guaranteed, you could have a week 's work and that 'd be it And then <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> you 're told, no matter how good of a worker you were, the work could just dry up, just dry\n<$A> So you have to work like fuck\n<$B> Yeah you 've no choice in the matter\n\n<$B> So how are you getting on yourself down in Belfast Peggy Anne\n<$C> Well I like it Like I 'm glad I 'm down here You know for a while I was worrying you know while I was doing my A levels, that I wouldn't get in at all\n<$B> Yeah\n<$C> Thankfully I passed and, I 'm up I was very worried about the accommodation, you know cos I had  applied to halls   when  and I never got in\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> And how do you sort of cope with the change from the lot of, you know the way up in Belfast you 've a lot more independence and that, how do you feel that you 're coping to that\n<$C> Well like without, do you mean without your mummy, and daddy\n<$B> Yeah Like you 're standing on your own two feet now like, even in terms of like you know socially and that like going out and\n<$C> Well socially I don't find it too bad because you 're always used to interacting with other people anyway, and you don't really have your mother and father sort of guiding you through in that respect But now, economically and all when you 're dealing with budgets for your money and finance and all like, I struggled at the start you know When I first got my loan, initially I just went to Top Shop River Island Oasis  and uh you know, blew the lot you know in, well blew quite a bit in the first couple of weeks But it was just as time progressed, now I realised I had to sort of\n<$B> You became more astute\n<$C> Yeah More  mo  money management was needed, you know when you 're paying your rent every so often\n<$B> What about in your own house Do you feel cosy or\n<$C> Well, I I when I first came up I didn't feel it, it wasn't like a home I suppose it it was in like it 's, only an empty shell but when you move in all your stuff and, bits and bobs from the house then If you get on well with your friends as well I think you can make anything a home Now, it 's a standard house It 's rather basic as you can see but, we try our best\n<$B> It does youse like\n<$C> No complaints\n<$B> No What about your course How are you finding that\n<$C> It 's not too bad Initially when I first went down,  when I was you know just trying to grasp what was going on and like they really did throw us in at the deep end, because all this reading and all like you 're meant do to, you 're not told, you know in school you 're so spoon-fed\n<$B> Yeah\n<$C> You 're like, if you have homework you 're told If you 've assignments you 're told when to hand them in and you 're helped in that respect But, up here you 're just expected to read the handbooks  and, right you 've got an assignment due on such a date and no-one 's going to keep telling you,   it has to be in  No-one 's going to, reinforce the fact that you know if you don't have it in you 're dead\n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B> Yeah\n<$C> Nobody cares up here like You have to it has to be your own initiative, do everything on your own initiative It 's, like I suppose you 're reading for a degree but I I really did not understand that until about five weeks into the course  when I was kind of struggling and realised that I had an awful lot of work ahead of me to catch up And the fact that I 've never done accounts before and a lot of people in the class have already, perhaps done maybe four years of accountancy   or  accounts They have a four years accounting background, you know through GCSE and A   level  Well I was, like I would be classed then as a weak student  in comparison to them  , so  inevitably I 'm, well\n<$B>  Mm mm  \n<$B>  Mm mm  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> You 're playing catch-up\n<$C> Yeah Big style\n<$B> What way do see yourself uh for these exams coming up\n<$C> Ah I just have an awful lot of revision to do over the Christmas period Now whether I get that put in or not is another story But, when I think about it in the long term I don't particularly want to do repeats in August, so I 'll try, och I 'd say if you do a couple of hours here and a couple of hours there\n<$B> Yeah\n<$C> Perhaps it\n<$B> Suffice anyway\n<$C> Yeah\n<$B> What about your assignments and all Have you everything your courseworks and that done\n<$C> Well thankfully I got eighty percent in my economics so I was over the moon with that I 'd be, I 'm like rather good with reading  material If it 's just a question and I just have to read up about it   if  it 's just a like applying things I I can do that no bother It 's just actually sitting down revising I have no patience, you know\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Do you think that 's your concentration span   or is it like \n<$C>  Yeah   Well it 's not that It 's, I just uh, I have no discipline\n<$B> Mm\n<$C> I just have to get into a routine, a regular routine And I I know if I kept up that type of pattern I 'd be fine It 's just starting it\n<$B> Yeah Do you find it 's easier to study up here or at home or, have you got you know\n<$C> Well at the weekend at home I work So and, I 've a hectic social life So I 've to try and keep on top of things up here And, you can do, whatever you have to do you have to do it in the university, because I know when you come back to this house,   it 's total relaxation  Yeah Definitely you just veg in front of the TV Because there 's, well like at home I lived in the country as you know and, I 've been so used to never having a neighbour, and  a proper neighbour, you know one of my friends or something   that  I can call over, to talk to or whatever And, now I 'm up in Belfast and all my friends are rather close\n<$B>  Too many distractions  \n<$B>  Mm", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "05288c85-afe8-45ea-9f4d-6cfef2aa7172", "added":

bit sort of would enjoy their drink and would be full of the devilment So Lilly anyway went but she wasn't feeling great so she didn't go out of her hotel all that that much Mary the next sister up Mary would only ever really take enjoy a drink when she would go away on holidays like that  So  Mary had been up at the   the Grotto  Mary had been up at the Grotto   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>

{"text": "<Encounter>\n\n\n<$A> What 're we now at June Yeah near enough Cos after him there was a brief fling with a black guy and then Gerry They 've all been black <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>\n<$B> Very good   I 've never been out with a black man \n<$A>  There 's a really funny story with the   uhm Jareese Did I tell you the Jareese story\n<$B> No\n<$A>  The one in between Fred and Gerry  It 's a cracker Oh my   God \n<$B>  Where 's   he from\n<$A> Uhm America And uhm, I went in I was going into my favourite, club Q-Bar and went in and I sort of I spotted him first of all He was at the door doing tickets or whatever and just noticed him And I thought oh he 's lovely And the reason why I 'd actually gone there that night was because they had somebody playing trumpet along with the DJ And I was there for this like big Q-Bar night years before and there was a guy playing violin along with it And I loved that you   know  So that 's the reason why I went down And it turned out it was him playing the trumpet He 's standing on this podium giving it loads with the DJ going on It was fantastic And I was going oh my God it 's that guy So then afterwards he came down and I bumped into him in the crowd and, I don't know we just started chatting and stuff And he was really sweet And then he came over again later and we were chatting a bit more And then he gave me his number and said please call me and I thought well why not So I arranged this date for me to go and watch him at the Blue Note where he was playing trumpet   So I went along like \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B>  Is it  , Bangkok\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Right\n<$A> That was Bangkok Oh of course like I mean where else would you get up to that sort of nonsense like  Fuck So I went along you know by myself glammed up to the nines Went into the Blue Note it 's just a smoky jazz place or whatever and sat there and ordered me gin and tonic and just sort of watched him and, whatever And uhm, and then I met him another night We went back to the Q-Bar and uh, we were just sitting chatting and stuff And then we decided  so funny we decided to like go back to his house And he 'd never drunk Saeng-Som so I thought right You 've   got to try  this So back to his place and I was still a bit like mm, not too sure you know if I you know I was just playing it cool or whatever I really fancied him and everything but, So we got back there but I was determined, not to stay for too long I said oh I 'm only staying for half an hour And he was trying like he 's got brilliant  uhm movie collection or whatever And the only I said no something short and the only short thing he had was like the Twin Towers being blown up you know <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  So we 're sitting watching that right  And I thought it was fascinating cos I hadn't had a TV in so long I was going fuck What  Rewind that bit  Sitting and drinking Saeng-Som So anyway the next thing was like I just got pissed and I thought oh fuck it I 'll just stay here So fell asleep Right nothing happened Well we 'd a bit of a snog and a cuddle And when he got his kit off I just couldn't believe my luck He was absolutely gorgeous But by this stage  I 'd worked out that he was forty-six years old  I swear to God I mean he looked about like thirty odd And he was like fucking married and divorced and had a mad life and all the rest But uhm, the next thing right then the next day this is the the big point right It was I just woke up to this  on the door, And I was like what the fuck 's that And he got up and he went outside and I just heard all this commotion at the door and stuff And I thought should I get up And then I just thought I was just like  , let  it go You know it 's probably his mates or something   you know , So he went off and he didn't come back for about an hour And I sort of fell asleep again and woke up at about ten o'clock thinking cheeky bastard You know   he just took off  That 's just really rude   you know   Aye So I got up and you know got myself dressed and sorted out Cheeky fucker And I was just about to leave when he came back into the room And he was like, oh my God you 're never going to believe what just happened you know  And I 'm like, what So he said uhm, basically what 'd happened was his ex-girlfriend this Thai girl who he 'd been seeing for one month,   who owned  a restaurant you know Alright\n<$B>  Mm  \n<$C>  Let it  \n<$C>  Banging on the door  \n<$C>  He just left  \n<$C>  With his mates  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B> Hi\n<$D> Hi\n<$A> I didn't know anything about her Never mentioned her to me   And  they 'd broken up like, a week before\n<$C>  Mhm  \n<$B> Oh fuck\n<$A> Fucker, But anyway she called round Like at least they were broke up At least they were  But she knocked on the door like eight o'clock in the morning or something and like I didn't hear any of this He was going to the door and she was like trying to come in to bring him back this book or   something,  And he had said no no no go away You can't come in So she of course knew there was somebody there She came back at nine o'clock And that that big dush dush dush  He opened the door and she shot him with a stun gun  Bazaam you know like fucking bang And they 're these things they 're like you know they they put you unconscious for fifteen   seconds You know  you 're totally out And apparently like thankfully cos he was dead fit it didn't you know   didn't  work or whatever He was like really winded but he managed to like grab her And they were going like this with the stun gun trying to get in to me going let me at her Let me see her and all this   She was trying to get into the room to get to me   Can you imagine Lying in bed with a fucking Saeng-Som hangover and getting stun-gunned in your bed like  I could 've just, it 's bad enough wakening up   sort of you  don't know some strange bloke running around getting stun-gunned by some psychotic Thai bitch like It 's just like Fuck  But he had to like wrestle with her and all And he got her into the lift And they went down in the lift and all And he came out and he was going ahh And the security guards were all standing there just being Thai going uh uh uh and just totally hopeless Do you know And , God they nearly had to call the police and everything, but they didn't in the end He managed to calm her down and got her to go away And, I was just like phew you know when he told me all this And I was just like, I was just so hungover and I was just like well  be thankful she didn't cut your dick off cos that 's what they normally do Don't think that was a very good response And he was just going, I feel so cold I feel so cold And I was just going, right well see you later \n<$C>  Mhm  \n<$C>  Oh my God  \n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$C>  Oh my God she was going to get you  \n<$C>  Oh I know  \n<$B> And that was the end of that\n<$A> Och it wasn't really like I just sort of scampered home And I was never so glad to get back to me flat like ever   you know I was  just going like that was just really too much Or well it could 've been so bad Like I would just not have appreciated getting stun-gunned  Do you know what I mean Really, like really It 's not on Do you know   what I mean  I had to go to work later and everything like It 's fucking not on So he called and he apologised and all And I said look you know and I was a bit mm and then I said okay Look well I suppose you know you haven't been in Thailand very long And, you know he 'd only been there four months or whatever I thought maybe he just doesn't really understand you know, the Thai   women   basically So I said alright fair enough Suppose nobody was more shocked than you were literally \n<$C>  Mm yeah  \n<$D>  <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> shocked  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$D> Stunned\n<$A> Stunned It was shocking So I invited him over He came over to my flat and stuff And that was like you know the first time we had sex And that was on the Saturday And

won't be any time now before Christmas\n<$B> No, no What are you doing for Christmas\n<$A> Uhm Well Last week 's Guardian was, had a very interesting trip to the Holy Land and Jordan\n<$B> Yeah, oh right, how nice\n<$A> And uhm I was just telling Brian about it at lunch and he said it sounded very good A very full six-day   trip  with something organised for every   day  including midnight ceremonies in Jerusalem   on Christmas Eve and Christmas dinner \n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  Yes, oh how lovely, yes  \n<$B> Yes\n<$A> And uhm, I thought six hundred and something

\n<$B> Well yeah, it 's it 's a group, you don't need a visa for Israel, you   need a visa for Jordan , yes, and a group visa does if they have more than twenty people, cos I was supposed to be going   last  Christmas, yes, yeah yeah, and then the   friend  I was going with, her sister had to be, her sister died   so  it was cancelled and uhm, but we were travelling on a group visa cos we were more than twenty   people  to Jordan and   you don't need one  for   Israel  but you just have to see to it I think that the Israelis don't stamp your passport\n<$A>  Need a visa for Jordan  \n<$A>  Really mm  \n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Oh I see  \n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A> That they don't, or I 'd never get back somewhere   else again, yeah \n<$B>  That 's right Something like that yeah  \n<$A> I think that the Damascan, yeah there 's just a lot of Arab writing on my passport at the moment\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> But I  I suppose once I saw that this was there that I could go on   it  then I began to think look I won't go   anywhere,  And I also looked into Tenerife I 'd like   to go  so For just go somewhere   And I  began to think maybe I shouldn't bother spending all that much money because I think, I have neglected I used to do Spanish last   year , and I thought maybe if I spent one month in Spain next summer  , doing an intensive course  because I 've had to give up I haven't time to do Spanish this term, It was too intensive and we had too much   homework,  So I just couldn't do it at all\n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Right yeah  \n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B>  Yeah, yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B> Yeah What tour operator was offering that\n<$A> Spanish   Spain Oh sorry the Jerusalem  Uhm it was in the Guardian so it was actually it looked like two girls

and the same amount of staff as in uh uh, fifty people in it But, the  this fella anyway was seen in rehab you see And he came up to us then long stay Eh <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear>, but, written on his chart, ehm, had no say Never allowed voice his opinion  with a domineering wife  So, ehm so we said Mike, how are you Fine Well was the missus in to you That so and so you 'd hear And uhm but anyway, Missus rang How was he He 's fine Well isn't he very bad Ah no he 's not He 's good  Now did he eat his breakfast  He did Ah he didn't  Ah did he This sort of thing But, all that 's wrong with

less  whether he was at home or abroad, but, the pension book So, the other night she came in, and she had an appointment to see Doctor McDaid, but she couldn't make it then But this lady that was with her, her husband took a night off He 's on night shift you know but he   took a night off, to bring  her in Uh she wanted to see the doctor And I was saying that that the doctor wasn't on at all now really, and we didn't know like whether that the doctor that 'd be standing in wouldn't know the history or anything But faith then she contacted him She rang McDaid anyway but It was all money anyway and pension book, you see She was saying, that uh, she was sort of saying, he that he 'd be ready to come home, even as bad and all as he was he 'd be ready to come home Kind of, he 'll only be in a few days It isn't worth your while charging like   for  the few days you have him But she came  in anyway and she said to me, Mike Mullins isn't inside in his bed at all And I said no He 's sitting up in a chair down there And, it would be down a good little bit and I had seen him about ten minutes before that But I said Christ God he could be under the chair or anything do you know  And I said I 'd go down Ehm went down anyway with herself and the doxy that comes with her Sorry nurse to bring you down but we didn't know him He was so badly looking  Well look it, I, I couldn't stop laughing  I\n<$E>  Oh  \n<$A>  Mm, right  \n<$A>  Oh I see   \n<$E> She didn't know her own husband\n<$B> She didn't know him He he got so badly looking\n<$E> Oh right\n<$B> And like she 'd seen him about two days before that  He got so badly looking in the two days And what harm but your man is clean and delighted to be there And uh he 's so, some street in Kells, where he was born And where 'd you where 'd you did you meet the missus Crossing the road \n<$A> How did he happen to find her\n<$B> Yeah  crossing the road \n<$A> There 's some queer ones happening like that now\n<$B> But uh I told McDaid the day after that she didn't know him Well look it, well wasn't wasn't he lucky says she  Says McDaid wasn't he very lucky But uh ah they 'd make you laugh like   Oh \n<$A>  I 'd   say that There 's great characters there   like <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  Oh yeah   And cash is so important to them do you know\n<$A> Right I suppose\n<$B>   And still \n<$A>  The pension   that would be a joint pension   would she be, having the pension brought in from the wife or would it be\n<$B> I don't know uh whether he made, whether she, yerra she 's a pensionable age too, but a tough nut like She 'd pull out every stop in the book do you know  And then you can meet and like just so nice I 'd say now I 'd say that there were as many as forty, box of chocolates handed in, for ones even that died during the year They 'd come back, do you know, an awful lot of them come back You 'd be surprised  how much stuff they 'd give you\n<$E> Yeah\n<$B> But ah \n<$A>   such a change from what we were growing up with When you think about it people had bad visions of the   home \n<$D>  You daren't   mention the home now, Oh it 's a hospital now <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear>\n<$B>   Saint Ita 's hospital \n<$A>  That it Saint Ita 's hospital  \n<$D> It was a workhouse one time\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> That 's what it was basically like a workhouse The graveyard is probably there at the   back The graveyard at one time \n<$B>  Yes yeah \n<$D>  It 's a famine graveyard  , Freddie <unclear> 7 sylls </unclear> to Mullane 's and uh Bernie Mullane 's farm <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$B> That would be a farm across the road\n<$A> Oh yeah on the way to Ardagh Is   that it \n<$D>  No   I don't think that No no this now is <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> graveyard\n<$A>   Right \n<$B>  In   around Saint   Ita 's if you go the back way \n<$D>  <unclear> several words </unclear>   And they came the other day I remember the grey donkey, the white donkey inside in the home When someone died they just threw a sheet over him, brought him out in donkey and car, pulled the lid on the <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> car and  into the grave,   <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  And no   coffin Nothing   like that \n<$E>  You   remember it\n<$D> I don't remember but I remember is the the grey donkey inside in the home\n<$E> Yeah\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> But you remember your man your father talking   about it    <unclear> several words </unclear>  They got Mass said there and they <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> now They 'd no flowers   <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> \n<$D>  Oh he he still is  \n<$A>  <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>  \n<$B>  And now the   luxury they die in like\n<$A> Yeah\n<$E> But isn't   it only right \n<$B>  I   I think it 's 'tis geared for death you know like\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> That they 're getting no time in a general hospital like we would have   You know  and, and they have the priest and they have every care really\n<$A>  Yeah like <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear>  \n<$E> But it 's very important\n<$B> Oh it is\n<$E> I think it 's awful important that people can die with dignity   you know \n<$B>  Yeah and   'tis important to to talk to the relatives and give them a cup of tea and   they  can stay overnight   or you know, whatever \n<$E>  It is  \n<$A>  <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear>  \n<$B> Yeah\n<$D> <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> twenty-five thousand now <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$B> Twenty thousand, with the curtains and, all that And all that 's going to be repainted now again They could still close it in two years ' time\n<$A> Why why would you close it is it\n<$B> Yerra no but you see that, it would be cheaper now to subsidise patients in a nursing home, as to to be paying staff in a hospital and, paying kitchen staff and all the rest\n<$A> But\n<$B> But still   yerra I wouldn't \n<$D>  They haven't   the care\n<$A> But I uh are are are all these nursing homes the same thing or are there   just good ones and bad ones  are there\n<$B>  Yerra sure there  \n<$D> <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear> I haven't a clue like you know\n<$B> I 'd say the nursing homes really\n<$A> They 're out to make the money for a start anyway Sure they 're they 're   they 're not \n<$B>  Uh uh   a lot of them say that they aren't even making money, unless they 're full all the time   That place now in Foynes  Yeah, and the heating and everything\n<$A>  I suppose if if they 're big  \n<$D> But sure one hundred and twenty or one hundred and thirty pound <unclear> several words </unclear>, no matter if they only charged them half inside in Saint Ita 's, it 'd be dearer, than <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>, Saint Ita 's I suppose Saint Ita 's then is subsidised   by the State is it To  provide that   <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  Oh 'tis Oh it is  \n<$D>  I know but if   if they charged them that that bit Tom even for for <unclear> several words </unclear> Those that are not on the pension they can keep that <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$B> Well there shouldn't like she wants, what they do is they they keep some of their their pension and  until they have twelve hundred built up like for, burial, and a person has that much built up, and a lot of them have good lot of money You know even though they 'd only get maybe a, what do they get back out of the pension Varying but they could get as much as twenty pound back out of the pension But you 'd be surprised how that builds up if they 're not smoking  , do you know  for the women we 'll say\n<$A>  Right right  \n<$D> But sure there 's some of them there ten or twenty years isn't there\n<$B> Yeah said you 'd be surprised how it builds up And then we 'll say a lot of, a lot of them then, would leave a a share of money and wouldn't have much after them So we give a novena of Mass is said for them while they 're living And well they 've everything thought of really   But uh \n<$A>  Some of those ones   have fairly big money too Have they \n<$B> Oh they do\n<$A> There 's that Tommy Byrne <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> He was never poor He had nearly thousands like you know  <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear> but he started off, and he started saving the day he took the home farm over You see he didn't drink <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear> He 'd live on the, milk of a cow and and a hen and   you know  and that 'd do him  In actual fact he never,   spent a  bob at all He lived the life of a pauper <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear> He 'd be as well off spending it\n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Wouldn't he Yeah\n<$A> Yeah cos   he  \n<$E>  When you   think of the way it went for   God 's sake \n<$A>  I know   Aye sure that that 's the point I 'm making It 's it 's a pity like I felt sorry in a way for him\n<$D> And how did it go\n<$A> Well, my sister got a good lot of it   anyway  The family got bits of it too like\n<$E>  Rosie  \n<$E> Yeah\n<$A> But wouldn't he be better off spending it on   himself I think basically surely like \n<$B>  Yeah he would He would He   would Yeah\n<$E> You won't have that problem anyway You needn't worry \n<$A> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> everyone got a thousand from him anyway\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Like that 's why <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> he actually starved himself he   did,  My brother-in-law went out there, <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear> He actually died of starvation\n<$B>  Right  \n<$B> Yes, malnutrition\n<$E> Hypothermia\n<$A> Hypothermia was it\n<$E> And his blood sugar was real low They thought he was after going into a coma with diabetes\n<$B> Yeah, yeah No food\n<$A> <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear>\n<$E> He couldn't get over the luxury when he was inside in the home that time\n<$B> And it wasn't luxurious at all at that time by comparison\n<$A> That house wasn't dilapidated <unclear> several words </unclear> You couldn't drink or <unclear> several sylls </unclear> The house had gone down so much You know   that 's the reason <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  roof dropped out eventually that there was   no room left you know \n<$B>  Yeah, the surroundings  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah  \n<$E> But wouldn't you think there now he was at school   and everything like  and was educated and everything you 'd kind of think\n<$A>  And was educated  \n<$B> Yeah\n<$E> But do you   know \n<$A>  Bachelors   they withdraw more and more\n<$E> You watch there now like Even do you know you watch Gorey 's and those there as well like They 've loads of money and yet\n<$B> But sure   like the people \n<$A>  I I know, that generation   as well of course like They  grew up at an awful bad time like, you see That 's the other side of that They grew up in the twenties and thirties and it was really bad", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL",

I 'm in bed with magnets \n<$D> Yeah she 's little ones just like   around her legs \n<$A>  <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> Cats dogs men even   \n<$D> No, around her legs And then, during the day, or at some stage as well she has two glasses of water and she puts one, on a north, side of a magnet   Puts  the other magnet with the south side with the other glass of water on that Big tall glass   now  She gets up in the morning and she takes this water and she, drinks half-and-half together, and she drinks the two glasses, like she mixes it all together   and  then drinks a glass in the morning a glass, for lunch a glass in the evening and she swears by it And she says now, when she first started to tell us this like she also doesn't take any of the red meat wine all the things you 're supposed to\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A> That 's really   kind of \n<$B>  And where   does she get protein from then\n<$A> Black   magic stuff \n<$D>  Oh she has   chicken and fish No

finished, I was convinced She claims that like uh Christmas time she 'd half a glass of white wine\n<$A> Yeah\n<$D> And she just,  froze in an instant Like she couldn't, she 'd a neighbour over or something and uhm they a  a had half a glass together and the neighbour noticed when she stood up that she\n<$A> Couldn't move\n<$D> Feeling yeah And she said now with the water she 'll notice when,

crowd the crowd, the crowd in all the clubs is just very uhm, oh it 's just all one trend Like they 're all just, one type of person There 's no variety and nobody really wants to talk and everybody 's just drinking and dancing, and posing and everything It 's just no good\n<$B> So, you don't really go out any more down in Cork\n<$A> Uhm I do I go to the pub until about twelve and I might go up

very diversified music tastes\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Oh yeah I have,   like yourself, you know like yourself  uhm, so \n<$A>  Yeah, yeah  \n<$A> And what are you doing in college\n<$B> I 'm studying,  I 'm trying to become a psychologist so, I 'm mainly interested in Psychology But uh, I 'm also doing Archaeology, Philosophy and Computers And I failed Computers so I 'm back down, repeating that, and I got fifty-five in Psychology So I have to do that again cos I needed sixty percent, so I 've to do that again\n<$A> And what are you going to keep on with Psychology\n<$B>  with it\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> I don't know yet, probably Archaeology See how it goes\n<$A> But you weren't that you weren't that interested in Archaeology   were you \n<$B>  Yeah but  , in Philosophy don't you need fifty-five   percent  to bring it on You see I only got forty-six\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Well it 's only to do honours If you were to do it as a minor   I think you could do \n<$B>  You can   you   can  do it Oh then I might hang onto it like   I don't know  I haven't thought about it I 'm just, interested in the repeat exams at the moment\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Mmm mm Mmm mm\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> And we 're going shopping now in a few minutes Have you made out your shopping list\n<$B> I don't make out a shopping list   I just see, you know \n<$A>  Why not   That 's the exact same as Sally\n<$B> What\n<$A> That 's the exact same as Sally She doesn't make one out either   Have you ever heard  her when she goes on about shopping\n<$B>  Really  \n<$B> No\n<$A> She loves going shopping like   She goes \n<$B>  Yeah  , but she nicks everything like She 's a thief \n<$A> She is not a thief \n<$B> She is a thief\n<$A> She goes into the shopping   centres Have you ever  seen her going into Quinnsworth 's and going, attention shoppers, and all this at the top of her voice and she goes and she takes ages to buy things She checks all the different prices on all the different products\n<$B>  <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> cheese  \n<$B> Yeah but this is also a woman who threw herself out of a window like \n<$A> Yeah, I suppose so\n<$B> So I mean, she 's obviously something wrong with her\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> So uhm, let me think\n<$A> How what did you did you have a job this summer\n<$B> Did I Yeah I was working in a drug centre   a drug treatment centre  Yeah, well I 've been working there for the last four years\n<$A>  Oh what was that like  \n<$A> Mm\n<$B> So I don't know I 'm got used to it but, yeah it 's grand like It 's just a matter of, just writing down names and handing them in to the nurse 's station or whatever\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> And   uh \n<$A>  And uh   did you did you not find it depressing\n<$B> In there No, cos people like, they 're all inner city Dublin crowd, the majority of them are, and like, most of them are dead sound\n<$A> Mm mm\n<$B> So, you know it 's interesting enough But you get a bit of hassle like, and, once, wasn't, there someone had just gone at somebody before that, one of the women threw rocks through the window, smashed all the windows, uh like you know\n<$A> You serious\n<$B> Yeah, seriously\n<$A> And were you inside the building when it happened\n<$B> Was I inside Yeah, yeah And then there was another one who was in the porch, and she smashed in She was cut off her course, and she smashed in the window and tried to climb through, and we had to try and kick her out And she, the security guard ran out into the porch, and he grabbed her like, and she bit into his arm, and he threw her out into the street, and she started threatening us that she 'd inject us with AIDS and all this\n<$A> Oh, my God\n<$B> So yeah it 's, you know though it 's interesting like   But you  get a bit of hassle the odd, the odd   time  you know Why what are you, are you working\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yes I 'm working in a, in a pub in town, in the Blue Note bar in Oliver Plunkett Street\n<$B> And, what is it Are you behind the bar, or are you a lounge girl\n<$A> Yeah yeah no I 'm behind behind I 'm   behind  the bar yeah It 's a fairly small pub like\n<$B>  Oh are you  \n<$B> Yeah yeah\n<$A> Yeah, so I get to keep the bar by myself But the only thing is that uhm, sometimes it can get really crowded in there and you 've got to clear the tables and serve at the bar and everything all at the same time like\n<$B> And what 's the crowd are they old or, young or\n<$A> Uhm, middle  young to middle-aged and then some really old, you know, because it used to have it used to have a real, like it used to be a real  prestigious uh pub It used to have all the legal crowd going in there from the South Mall and everything, and then it just turned into a sort of uh trendy, uh elitist intellectual thing and they all go in there They think they 're really cool like Uhm but some of the old guys still go in there who used be   in the legal trade \n<$B>  And   you 're trying to get another job though aren't you\n<$A> Well   no not any more, I 'd \n<$B>  Well, you 've been offered one haven't you  \n<$A> Yeah, yeah, yeah I thought I didn't like working there but now I 've decided that I do\n<$B> You 've got used to it\n<$A> Yeah so, I don't know what I 'm going to do about the other job because I told the other man I 'd work for him as well   So, I don't know \n<$B>  And  , are you going to hang on to that job for during the year like during college year\n<$A> Yeah, I 'd   say so, yeah \n<$B>  To get a bit   extra money\n<$A> Yeah but the only thing is if I could get a day job it would be much better, I mean if I could maybe do afternoons in the Blue Note But then you see that would clash with my schedule in college, but I don't want any late nights like, working You know the late nights, I 'm going to spend on going out\n<$B> Yeah but I mean you 're not going to be studying til after Christmas You know what I mean In   second year \n<$A>  No no   I am this year No I am this   year like \n<$B>  Yeah you   won't though You know what I mean I mean if we had 've, if we had 've studied from Christmas onwards,   last year  we would have got As in everything You know you would 've\n<$A>  Mmm  \n<$A> Mmm I know,   but like, but you wouldn't feel comfortable, you wouldn't even \n<$B>  Cos we left it til the last few weeks   Comfortable right say in November if you knew you weren't doing a

{"text": "<Holistic medicine 2>\n\n\n<$D> She 's able to make all these, concessions to it like But she 's was saying about the magnets that this guy, who she met at this conference had he goes around he travels around to all these conferences I think he was American, but he had a rucksack specially made with a magnetic strip in the back so that when he had it the magnet was directly on his spine   And he claimed  this worked that if he didn't have this he wouldn't be able to travel He wouldn't be able to walk without his spine would seize up And then she met this other guy   who was doing experiments  Well that 's, still what I thought but this other guy is doing experiments with the different waters   to see  Cos apparently they say if you 're pregnant don't mix the waters,   only  drink the north or the south but you don't mix the water from both\n<$A>  Does it work  \n<$A>  That 's so psychological  \n<$A>  Oh right  \n<$X>  Oh  \n<$B> What you mean,\n<$D> When you 're drinking the stuff I don't know,   just \n<$A>  So it 's   superior   intelligence if you drink the north , and lower intelligence if you drink the south   kind of thing \n<$B>  Drink    \n<$C>  Just normal I think Rachel \n<$D>  No no it 's normal if you drink either \n<$B>  What do you mean north south Dublin  \n<$D> No you see , you missed the first part The the huge big magnets she has she puts them, at some stage in the day she puts a glass of water, on the south pole of one and the second glass of water on the north pole of the other And then she mixes the water and drinks the water\n<$B> No north and   south \n<$D>  And apparently  \n<$B> That 's Michelle 's fault\n<$C> It is not \n<$B> I want to get out of here as quickly as I can I don't want to go near the north side\n<$C> Ah hang on now I just said I 'd just   feel safer  once I 'm on the south side\n<$A>  You 're a snob  \n<$B> Yeah which meant\n<$A> A down and out snob that 's all\n<$C> Sorry my mum 's from the north side I can't \n<$B> So 's Maire 's Oh no your dad is\n<$D> No mum is   My dad 's from the west \n<$A>  My dad 's from the north side  \n<$B> He 's from where\n<$D> He 's from Crumlin so he 's   a gentleman \n<$A>  Oh   I thought you meant I thought you meant the west of Ireland\n<$D> It 's not really the south side at all\n<$A> But Maire doesn't know outside the Pale   you see, Very  limited\n<$D>  No no  \n<$B> Galway Where 's Galway\n<$D> No I like Galway actually I 've been there\n<$C>   Been there just once \n<$A>  Been there done that  \n<$D> I can find it on the map It 's the smaller places like, Mayo and that that I can't quite locate \n<$B> And what about Tipperary Where do you think Tipperary is\n<$D> That 's in the middle isn't it cos it doesn't have a coastline\n<$B> Mmm yeah not really middle That 's that 's uhm, what 's the county that Athlone 's in\n<$A> Offaly\n<$X> Mm\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Is it\n<$B> Yeah course it is\n<$C> Roisin thinks, is it \n<$A> Haven't   a clue \n<$B>  Ah it is   It is It is\n<$D> Anyway there 's this guy doing experiments with the different water from the north pole \n<$B> From the north south right you put the water the water at the north pole of the magnet and some   water right \n<$A>  He mixes the   penguins with the polar bears You have two magnets\n<$B> What\n<$A> He mixes the penguins with the polar bears\n<$B>   Okay  \n<$D>  You 've two   magnets right Big round things like that   okay , And you know the way magnets have separate poles\n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B> Mm\n<$D> Right so on one magnet you leave it with the north pole up and put the glass on top north pole and the other magnet you leave with the south pole up put the glass to the south pole\n<$B> Mm hmm\n<$D> So you mix the water in the morning This guy took the two waters, he 's doing experiments to see of there is a difference like and apparently this is even funnier like it 's not really scientific at all but apparently if you soak bread in north water and then soak bread in south water one goes \n<$B> Uh what\n<$D> One goes \n<$B> What\n<$D> One goes \n<$C> She can't get it out\n<$A> It must be good\n<$D> It goes mouldy quicker \n<$B> The bread\n<$D> One pole\n<$B> Oh no \n<$A> So that 's why there 's so much famine in the southern hemisphere \n<$B> What What 's that got to do with the price of bread \n<$D> But anyway,\n<$A> Moving swiftly onwards\n<$B> Well there 's this woman at work and she 's got really I think it 's arthritis anyway cos her hands it 's awful It 's really bad I don't know how she works

enjoy that film though\n<$B> Ah yeah yeah\n<$A> I thought it was so far-fetched\n<$C> Yeah but you had to laugh at it cos it was kind of funny\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> I don't know I didn't think they 'd get together in the end I didn't think she 'd marry him\n<$C> Well they kept getting it together   and it went on \n<$B>  And then I always   thought but no well, I always thought when she was with him though that it was because she felt sorry for him and because,   she felt kind of more protected \n<$D>  No I thought it wasn't   from the very beginning that it wasn't that was why\n<$B> Oh when  when they were sitting on the tree   When she  put his hand when she put her hand on his\n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D> Mm But the whole time even when she said like, you know when they were older and when  he 'd go and visit visit her in college\n<$B> Yeah\n<$D> I thought she really treated him like an equal that she didn't feel sorry for him, That 's why she\n<$B> But then why did she say oh you don't know the meaning  I mean you can't understand\n<$A> Because he couldn't\n<$D> No she didn't she didn't mean you can't understand love\n<$X> \n<$A> She did She said something like, you don't know what it means or  She said something like that\n<$D> I thought she meant more like you don't know what it means to me, rather than\n<$B> No I don't I don't know I don't know\n<$C> Better   maybe not to analyse it  <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> this week\n<$D>  Ah well \n<$B>  I always think  , I always thought she was just feeling sorry for him and kind of, not all the   time I thought  there was   something there like \n<$D>  No I thought  \n<$D>  I thought it was really   really sad when he, looked at his kid and said is he\n<$B> Yeah\n<$D> And he didn't want to say is he stupid because\n<$B> What did he say Well he   began to say \n<$C>  Is he normal or something \n<$D>  He he said  , is he clever or  or is he and he didn't finish it like\n<$A> Yep\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> She was anorexically thin bones ribs and everything was sticking out all over the place\n<$C> Disgusting\n<$B> I thought she was going to throw herself off the building You see I didn't think they 'd get together And I thought, that in the end that she 'd throw herself off the building,\n<$C> Pretending to fly\n<$B> Yeah well See the shoes   They 're like the  shoes that Teresa wears, yeah There 's this girl that I was in Germany with, she brought five pairs of platforms\n<$C>  Oh God  \n<$C> I don't know how   people walk in those \n<$B>  On on holiday   Well it 's not it was a working holiday but I mean, they

dress\n<$C> It 's just short\n<$D> What colour is it\n<$C> It 's black with a white sort of band there, and white band around the, bottom\n<$A> It 's real cocktailyish\n<$B> So it 's all black except

for Christmas\n<$B> Did you\n<$A> Because I don't think he 'll be over before Would you consider writing He 's been very good to you\n<$B> I 've written a letter\n<$A> Have you\n<$B> Yeah last week\n<$A> Right well I 'll get Pat to post mine tomorrow\n<$B> He 's coming over for Christmas\n<$A> No he won't be over before Christmas, so I 've written the letter to them\n<$B> Oh right okay Yeah Anyway how are your glasses,  working out\n<$A> Very  problematic\n<$B> Hmm Well\n<$A> I find it difficult with the two different sights in the glasses   You feel  that you 're going to fall down when you look down which is the reading part\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> What you have the bifocals\n<$A> Yeah, and you look up and it 's for ordinary outdoor walking or driving whatever\n<$B> Well, I find with my glasses now mine aren't bifocal like yours are Aren't they bifocal They are Mine aren't bifocal but, I find like that, if you wear if they 're for reading and you wear them out, there 's, I don't know it 's sort of like uhm, they 're uncomfortable Your sight is uncomfortable\n<$A> Wearing spectacles is definitely, a problem\n<$B> Why\n<$A> Ah, I keep losing mine I 've three pairs now\n<$B> You 're the only one I know, who keeps losing their glasses I don't know how you manage,  I don't know how you manage to lose them so much\n<$A> I 'll do like Anna Fitzgibbon and I 'll get myself one of those things, you hang around your neck and the glasses hang on The only problem is I 'd need three of those\n<$B> That 's a waste of time Really is You know I mean, what you have to do is just, if you had the one pair, probably wouldn't lose them\n<$A> Well I 've all sorts of problems which are too deep, and too long-winded to go into now   like  watching television If I lie on the couch I can't see\n<$B>  Oh yeah  \n<$B> What\n<$A> If I 'm watching television and I lie on the couch with my varifocal glasses I can't see   I 'm  uncomfortable\n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B> Mm,\n<$A> And then if I go to look for my ordinary glasses for watching television I seemed to have misplaced them\n<$B> Mm, well I don't lose mine at all But then again now I only bring them into college, so, you can't really go too wrong, can you\n<$A> Well talking about eyes and teeth, I think it 's about time you went for an appointment to the dentist\n<$B> Okay,   I haven't  I went last no actually, I don't think it is I went last, around the time of summer I went in, September and thankfully there was nothing wrong Actually, I 'll tell you what, I haven't had a filling, since I 'd say two years now\n<$A>  It 's  \n<$A> I didn't know you went in September I know there was a bill in for June which you were disputing, and I asked the dentist about it and they said you had definitely been\n<$B> Did you see the hygienist\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> What did she say\n<$A> She just cleaned my   teeth \n<$B>  She she   didn't say anything She scraped your teeth\n<$A> This week when I went to the dentist he said I 'd nothing to have done either He said I was doing remarkably well considering it was two years since I 'd been with him\n<$B> That 's crazy Barmy Ah no no in all fairness now I only go about once every, eight months About once every eight months\n<$A> Ah sure that 's enough I think really You haven't had any problem at all with your teeth   Eithne 's supposed to go  Eithne 's supposed to go down to uh Garret Fitzwilliam about hers And she 's just putting it on the long finger I mean he may have   the answer for her \n<$B>  I have about five fillings  \n<$B>  She was supposed   to go down Oh she 's, last night\n<$A> Well she made no effort,\n<$B> Mm Well it 's her business,\n<$A> It is her business to a point The only thing is that she 's\n<$B> It 's her business completely\n<$A> , well if they get really bad and she has to have a lot of work done on them your father 's paying for them cos she doesn't have enough PRSI contributions By the way talking about PRSI contributions did you organise your tax rebate\n<$B> No\n<$A> Well well lucky for you you 're so wealthy you don't have to bother\n<$B> There 's only a bit I have left to do Not too much longer\n<$A> Not too   much longer for what \n<$B>  Ah but it 'll be  ,\n<$B> It 'll be groovy to be getting all my money in for a change, cos I 've been paying so much tax It 's not funny at all\n<$A> Well basically it 's your own fault\n<$B> Well it is my own fault But I mean, it 's it 's you know it 's a stupid system that the tax office don't cop on that I 'm only earning twenty pounds a week, and they insist on charging forty-eight percent tax on it\n<$A> Well that 's the way they work emergency tax And that 's to make you   get your affairs in order \n<$B>  What exactly is   emergency tax anyway\n<$A> Exactly what you you 're paying\n<$B> But why do they call it emergency\n<$A> You pay\n<$B> ,\n<$A> Emergency tax, when you haven't got your tax free allowances in order And it makes you go all the faster to   go and get it \n<$B>  So   emergency means quick to the tax Revenue Commissioner 's office and get your tax   free allowance \n<$A>  And full and full   amount\n<$B> Full amount Oh cos you end up paying forty-eight percent anyway Well that 's what I 'm on at the moment, and I really do think it 's crazy, absolutely crazy\n<$A> Are you working on Sunday night\n<$B> Mm, no I 've got Vivian to do it for me, which is just as well  , Cos I can't keep working  that much Quite sufficient It 's absolutely perfect\n<$A>  Yeah one night a week is quite sufficient for you to work  \n<$A> It 's ridiculous if you would even consider working any more than that\n<$B> Yeah it is you see And I told, the manager that I couldn't work, uh, more than the one night a week you know So, he uh he said yeah fine And of course, he 's a bit of head like a sieve, and it went in one ear and out the next And the next week sure wasn't I on, wasn't I on the two nights You know it 's crazy really I mean if you can't remember that kind of thing I mean that 's what the manager 's there for\n<$A> Maura you 're a little insignificant person in their eyes\n<$B> There 's only twenty of us twenty-five of us in the bar I 'm twenty I 'm one twenty-fifth of the whole bar\n<$A> What about all the other people on the staff\n<$B> Well they 're the other twenty-four  The team works together The bar works together and, you know we\n<$A> You 're talking rubbish You 're so, insignificant You do about   six hours work \n<$B>  I do my best  \n<$A> Six hours work per week\n<$B>  Some day, some day I might do more I might do more during my summer after my block Actually I don't know what I 'm going to do for this summer, cos I just can't decide what I 'm going to do I mean it 's not even near the summer now but like\n<$A> Earn heaps of money and pay for your fees for your final year\n<$B> Make my millions, yeah Ah well then you never know\n<$A> You see that Listermint\n<$B>   Yeah \n<$A>  And Ponds Cream     Now when  you 're going upstairs would you bring them up with you please, because I 'm tired of rubbish being left around the kitchen\n<$B>  Yeah <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  \n<$A> Okay\n<$B>   Okay \n<$A>  Okay   \n<$B> That 's all I get is okay\n<$A> Will you please take those silly curlers out of your hair  You do that and you 've a perm I don't understand\n<$B> The perm makes me look like Shirley Temple\n<$A> Yeah she 's young and cute but What what else do you want  Well ah\n<$B> Well I 've got to have my hair nice for tonight\n<$A> Tonight 's the big night\n<$B> Yep\n<$A> Ah yeah it should

 Well if  \n<$B> If we win a Christmas arrangement tonight what will I do with it   Have Christmas early this year \n<$A>  Well if you were to   win uhm you know, if you were to win uhm, a prize like

exciting\n<$B> Have a ball\n<$A> I 'm only free on Friday night because I 'm working on   the  Saturday Mm, so it 's not too much free time is it Actually the match is on tonight I 'd say there 's some people going out tonight\n<$B>  Saturday night  \n<$B> Well for some reason there doesn't seem to be an awful lot of   interest \n<$A>  No   there actually isn't No there 's not like I mean,

was See as well it was on on a Saturday night so, you know you 'd think that there 'd be more going out anyway to start with And then you know, wasn't supposed to be I was working that night as well and it wasn't supposed to be very good out because it was either over-packed or else it was just, you know it was too young or Didn't work out at all They ended up going into town afterwards   and going to a dinner \n<$B>  So at twenty you   , so at twenty you consider yourself old\n<$A> Well there was sixteen and seventeen year olds there\n<$B> They should 've been home in bed\n<$A> Mm, well they should have been doing stuff like going to the cinema, or\n<$B> Ah there 'll probably be a fair few people around or I wonder will Eithne feel she has to go out\n<$A> Probably not It 's on at seven\n<$B> Oh well she 's going to the gym at seven   or half seven \n<$A>  Well   that finishes at, well that doesn't finish until, uhm, about half eight\n<$B> Well she obviously isn't planning on going but somebody will probably tell her today about it\n<$A> Yeah, I was thinking about getting contact lenses,  Except for, except for I only wear them for reading But they 're so cumbersome They really are   Mmm \n<$B>  If   you were wearing glasses permanently  and you, felt that you know   they were  spectacles were awkward but, you just wear them for study and  and not even for reading but just for study close study, you 'd be mad to get them\n<$A>  Ah yeah  \n<$A> Yeah well, if I was wearing them permanently I 'd uh I 'd definitely get contacts\n<$B> I always remember one night Rosemary lost her contact lens, in uh one of them in Jury 's Just as we were going out the front door about twelve o'clock at night, we were all down on our hands and knees looking for the contact lens And uh visitors  who were staying in Jury 's came in the front door and they all got down and they helped us And she found it,   Mind you \n<$A>  Yeah   you do\n<$B> Mind you it 's become the thing now to insure your contact lenses so I suppose it 's not too serious if you lose them\n<$A> Yeah,   What \n<$B>  What   do you want for your dinner\n<$A> Oh uhm I 'd I 'd like, chicken\n<$B>

originally from  , I was born actually in Limerick but I 'm from County Clare\n<$B> Okay Tell us a little bit about County Clare \n<$A> Well I I hate the   I hate the sight of the well, the the scenery is nice  but I found that when I came to Dublin that I I became immediately acclimatised Uhm,   uh \n<$B>  At   what age did you come to Dublin at\n<$A> When I was when I was eighteen Eleanor\n<$B> Was it much of a transgression moving from Sligo to,  It wasn't Sligo\n<$A> Eleanor it  it wasn't Sligo It was Clare And transgression is not the your your your your grammar Eleanor is a little bit faulty there now \n<$B> What was I saying\n<$C> Transition\n<$A> And and   and and  transition Well it wasn't because I had been to boarding school uhm for five years so I didn't find, it difficult, to leave home I I it wasn't that, I I wasn't homesick Uhm and at that time I enjoyed, very much going down to to the clear air, and\n<$B>  Transition  \n<$C> Where were you at boarding school Terry\n<$A> Well I boarded in in Limerick which was quite near It was uhm, uh Saint Munchin 's College which was founded in seventeen, something and uhm, it 's still there\n<$C> And what what was it did you enjoy it Did you play games or\n<$A> Well actually Leah I didn't  I didn't play any games but I did act in the school play, in my final year against the the wishes and advice of my beloved parents\n<$C> Why was that\n<$A> Because I had a passion for theatre, Leah darling\n<$B> You 're now in college Terry What are you studying in college\n<$A> Well Eleanor I 'm pursuing a modular degree, and I 'm in in my second year\n<$C> And does that mean you are working at the same time\n<$A> Well yes it does I I am of course a civil servant and uhm I 'm I have to confess that that that while of course the the Irish Civil Service is in some ways excellent I find that because I have a creative temperament I find, I find uhm the atmosphere stifling\n<$C> Stifling What do you mean by, stifling That you 're not doing enough work or\n<$A> Well I find I find uhm that, that, I I find that, I find that the work  I find the people I work with and the mentality, of the people is very narrow and sort of provincial Uh there isn't any uhm, uh any uhm, sort of, there 's no, breadth or depth of understanding\n<$C> And you work is it Monday to Friday\n<$A> Well Leah I work Monday to Friday And there are some days I don't quite make it to   to Friday, but I do my best I  work Monday to Friday I now have flexitime but I would 've preferred the old system uhm To me I  I 'm not a punctual person, neither am I tidy and uhm I, found I had it took me, quite a long time to get used to to to uh uh, being in at nine o'clock And then just when I had got used to that then we changed over to to flexitime \n<$C> Eleanor what are you studying\n<$B> I 'm studying Medicine Leah\n<$C> And what at the moment you said you are in the hospitals or are you\n<$B> I 'm in the Mater at the

're seeing the dead bodies\n<$B> Yeah, yes\n<$C> And do you like that\n<$B> Well it 's what I always wanted to do so I suppose I 'm doing what I wanted to do\n<$C> Mm hmm and what do you think of that Terry Would you like to\n<$A> Well it it immediately it immediately reminds me of necrophilia But of course Eleanor, uhm I I yes I think I I must admire Eleanor because uhm uhm, she has   she has immense, skill and talent And she uhm, she I think the field of medicine is particularly difficult Uhm uhm I, I wouldn't I I I  I haven't any aptitude for medicine, but if I had the aptitude I I think I would have liked to have done uh to have have worked in some branch of   medicine  But I I I think that of course Eleanor then  as well as well, as as as being as being as being a good clinician she also uhm is quite uhm, knowledgeable in knowledgeable in literary matters, cos she has corrected me corrected me numerous times And and I as a student of English was highly, mortified \n<$B>  Mm hmm  \n<$C> Well Eleanor what do you think of that\n<$B> I 'm flattered Leah \n<$C> So does Michael tell you such nice things no\n<$B> No \n<$C> And uhm, were you doing anything nice today Were you studying or, were you in the library\n<$B> Today I went oh I didn't tell Terry  what happened last night   coming out of the library , Uhm last night when I was coming out of the library at about, quarter  to ten at night I was just coming out  , you know the main entrance door The next thing a car passed me with nobody in it Somebody had left the hand-brake off the car, and it started to roll And I went oh my God I could see the car hitting the wall before it actually did It went back and it hit do you know the entrance post, where you come in with the   big uhm , thing Well it hit that And I freaked out I came back here and I was as white as a ghost after it I was that like, you know I might well just have been walking past and the car   would 've hit me \n<$C>  Oh yeah tell Terry  \n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$A>  And  , you well you didn't think Eleanor that perhaps there might have been a spirit propelling the car, did you Perhaps one of your post-mortemed patients \n<$B> You don't have to be cruel Terry to be kind \n<$A> Eleanor you have to be cruel to be it 's  you have to be cruel to be kind in the right measure \n<$C> So do you 've any plans for this evening And plans   for this evening \n<$B>  This evening Leah   you and I are going out \n<$C> Oh yeah that 's right Well Terry\n<$A> Well Leah and  Leah and Eleanor are going drinking We don't  we don't know exactly where, but they 're going out Two  girls on the town, and God knows where they will end up \n<$C> Oh I  I reckon we 'll end up   here \n<$B>  I know   where I 'm ending up tonight, \n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> So uhm uhm, what can I say uhm\n<$C> When uhm, do you go to college at nights Terry What sort of times are you, at lectures\n<$A> Well Leah I have lectures on Monday and Wednesday And I, uhm have two lectures on on Monday one at half past six, one at half past seven I have, two on Wednesday one at half past six one at half past seven and then at half past eight I have a tutorial,  Eleanor and I, , sorry yeah\n<$C> Have tutorials together\n<$A>  no well we don't we don't actually we don't we don't we don't  the tutorials are very interesting I have a very nice uh  a very nice  a very nice girl I won't say her name because you know it isn't you know but she 's a very very nice girl And uhm, uhm,   I do  like girls despite the sound of my voice \n<$B>  Ter  \n<$B> Terry you were describing the modern man to me\n<$A> Oh yes sorry, Eleanor asked me about the modern well the modern man The modern man nowadays must have, must be jangling a bunch of keys Keys of what The keys, of a motor car A BMW\n<$C> Why do you think that he has to have a BMW and keys and money\n<$A> Well, a  a lady needs to  to be driven around She she can't be  she can't be expected, to sit on the back of a bicycle \n<$C> I don't even get to sit on the back of a bicycle\n<$A> Well I think that you know a lady needs to be taken out and looked after uhm  despite what the modern I know there is a  a modern trend towards equality of the sexes and while I am in favour of equality of the sexes I think that, I still believe in the old-fashioned uhm uhm, in the old-fashioned uhm  , uhm  standards standards Like uh think a man should be able to drive    his his girlfriend home \n<$C>  Jangles   \n<$C>  So so you believe   that a man should open a door for a woman and, uhm, let her go first and pay for her and stand back and\n<$A> Well I think, well well one thing I would would want to say about the BM  W and about the car there are some  women, present company excluded of course, but there are some women who judge a man, uh by his car, and I think that that is a  that is quite a mistake Uhm I think that, uh yes\n<$C>  Eleanor do you think money is important\n<$B> Yes Leah I think money is important to a certain extent yeah\n<$C> And, do you mean to sort of live comfortably or to, sort of, show everybody that you have the money\n<$B> No I mean that a man should be able to give a woman the type of lifestyle that she 's accustomed to\n<$C> Hmm mm that 's fair enough\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Yeah I would agree with Eleanor I think that uhm uhm uhm, where marriage is concerned it 's alright when one is very young and when one has boyfriends, but I think\n<$B> Uhm is that what you call this Terry\n<$A> Uh it 's okay when one is young one can  one can have fun certainly But I think that, uhm like the person whom a girl marries, has to be, she has to be very sure  of of and what what Eleanor says uh you know, the the important like people say the that the money doesn't matter and you know there are plenty of things you can buy without money But at the same time if you haven't got money, you know, as my father has often said, at the end of the day somebody has to pay\n<$B> That 's true yeah\n<$A> Somebody has to pay And I think that people who don't have there are there is a certain type of parasitically or is it parasitic, male who tend to to latch onto women You know I mean I mean I I I present company excluded of course but, uhm, that there there are certain types of men who they 're you know they 're kind of sort of fancy men and they they kind of, they 're dressed to the nines Uhm, they wouldn't of course be wearing Este/e Lauder or  uh uh Este/e Lauder because Este/e wouldn't allow it, or I   wouldn't I I I wouldn't allow it \n<$B>  Especially if you couldn't buy it for them   \n<$A> But but uhm but but, they they tend to be uhm now I I I 'm not one of those really even though I like to have things done for me but I 'm not really uhm I 'm more of uhm eh what am I I 'm more of I 'm more of an independent    \n<$B>  Get up   and go type\n<$A> Yes I 'm more of an independent get up and go type yes exactly exactly Thank-you Eleanor You saved me there now from an

yeah\n<$A> Well that one 's thick\n<$C> How do you know\n<$C>  the you see it all goes back to the thing about you and colours I mean is the colour that you see the same colour that I see\n<$B> No, it 's not\n<$A> Yes it is\n<$B>   It 's not It 's not \n<$C>  How can you prove it Nobody 's able to prove it  \n<$B> You can't prove that black is black or white is white\n<$C> No  I mean he he could be I I he could think that he 's dressed in green now\n<$B> Yeah\n<$C> But he 's actually in   black, to me he 's in black \n<$A>  No, the only   confusion you get is between red and green you know\n<$C>   No but how can you know \n<$B>  No no no no no no   That 's your conception of black\n<$A> Yeah okay\n<$B>   It might not be \n<$C>  You see it might not be red to me  \n<$B> Yeah, it 's uh what you what 's black Black is only what you think this is,\n<$A> A very dark colour yeah\n<$B> No, but you 're   no, it 's  not only your idea, the mental   picture it 's not, it 's not an actual definition \n<$C>  No but  \n<$A>  Oh right, so then blind people can   actually see colour\n<$B> No\n<$A>   In a way, well,  they can have their own conceptions of colours \n<$C>  No, well no no it 's just   Well take here like like this this this uhm, this beige wall you know, I know that 's the colour beige and every time I 'm referring to it it 's beige and to you it 's always beige as well\n<$B> Mmm\n<$C> But to you that beige might look like this black, yeah So you might not see that colour all over this room, whereas I 'd see this colour\n<$A> Yeah\n<$C> And then I might see this colour as, as black\n<$A> Okay   so it 's just a label  you have on your   perception of colour \n<$C>  So it 's, yes  \n<$C>  Yes   And because everybody keeps calling everybody says you know since you were a child say well that 's silver\n<$B> Yeah\n<$C> You always associate silver with that, but you may actually see that as red in your\n<$A> Yeah\n<$C> Do you see what I mean\n<$A> Well it 's silver to me, okay \n<$B> <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> Where did I come across that argument It was\n<$C> With me actually probably about a week ago\n<$B> Was it\n<$C> Yeah\n<$B> Yeah No I 've come across it before too, uhm   Oh I remember  I 've seen it Yeah I know it 's philosophy Well maybe I uh actually uh I went to a few lectures on it,   and he  stood up the top pointing at blackboards and green boards actually yeah\n<$C>  Philosophy  \n<$A>  Did you  \n<$C> Yes\n<$B> Or blackboards or green boards or whatever\n<$C> That 's like this this here could be a, a uh a box of tissues\n<$B> Mmm\n<$C> But I always perceive it as a box of eggs \n<$S> It 's yellow in colour yeah\n<$C> No black\n<$B> Oh is it Sorry yeah \n<$A> Oh   that 's good \n<$B>  Great   laughs, mm\n<$A> Is this true\n<$B> A little bit of it yeah\n<$C> That 's why I always think about you know people they don't they 've no dress sense, colours\n<$A> Yeah because my mother has a friend and she 's uh she dyes her hair blonde, but the the roots are always black It 's not Nellie  But the roots are black down   to there And  she just doesn't see, she doesn't seem to see it herself and she 'd wear red and then she 'd wear kind of hairbands that would clash with her like piss-blonde hair And oh\n<$C>  It 's bottle blonde  \n<$B> Oh can we use a word like that Can we\n<$A>  Yes\n<$B> Can we\n<$A> That 's allowed\n<$B> Ah\n<$C> Beep \n<$A> It 's a,  Mam always reckons that she 's colour blind cos we 'll say different shades of the same colour she always seems to wear together and everything But you 'd be morto to go out with her like\n<$C> Therefore she must perceive that two colours must be perceived as the same for her\n<$B>   Mmm \n<$A>  Like    she 's known around Boyle that ah, she 's uhm, known for her like disgusting colours Like people like say oh look at her today So she must have a   very severe case of that \n<$C>  Well she 's changed   her colour to red hair today, blonde tomorrow\n<$B> And piss-blonde the next day by all accounts   isn't it  \n<$A>  Well that 's what I call blonde \n<$C>  You you 've got worse still than you have already   Jeez <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> No but it 's bottle blonde hair <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> It 's not natural blonde It doesn't look like the colour of a   natural blonde \n<$C>  No highlights  \n<$B> Right\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Okay\n<$C> There used to be a guy out in, where I used to go to school he used to dye his hair\n<$A> Really\n<$C> Blonde yeah\n<$A> But what I hate is\n<$B> Barry dyes his hair\n<$A> Oh my

{"text": "<Politics 1>\n\n\n<$A> But uhm, the reality is, that it suited an awful lot of people cos as I said to you the other night there 's no way that the vast majority of Fianna Fa/il TDs could go back to their constituencies, and say that they were going to propose, uhm divorce or abortion or anything else like They wouldn't get elected themselves   next time And so it suited  but could Bertie, Bertie is in a personal dilemma   <unclear> 2 words </unclear> \n<$B>  Though Bertie today went on record as supporting divorce  \n<$B>  No he   drew attention to that distinction\n<$A> Yeah, but the but the point is   that \n<$B>  That Fianna   Fa/il have decided to put   to bring forward divorce legislation and support it\n<$A> But but nevertheless, there 's no guarantee they will be deliver able to deliver the country on that and,   despite all their their their their  their uhm   lip  service and everything   one would still  be   careful  In order for them to carry divorce in the country they have to change the thing about, the Matrimonial Home Bill   and they still haven't done that \n<$B>  Will you have another drop of wine Bronwyn It 's there  \n<$C>  Yes thanks  \n<$B>  Nice isn't it  \n<$C>  'Tis yeah  \n<$B>  And he said he said it   that the uh yeah he said in great detail which interested me I was surprised at  how detailed he was and how, informed he was in the sense that he had it so fresh in his mind But he listed the way they approached the case Quite different from the last time\n<$A> Mmm\n<$B> Because last time, they were not in favour But it was because, there was an awful lot of things, that weren't attended to which were, cognate to it But he listed about six things that they 've instituted, which a whole range of ministries, which uh have been designed, to structure the context and the parameters so that in fact the divorce legislation that was brought in wouldn't have the dire effects that some people feared\n<$A> Mmm\n<$B> And that this was still ongoing, and that a range of measures had been taken, and that having <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> that way, they were  moving ahead with the divorce legislation in a different, context where they had covered lots of problems\n<$A> But they haven't covered the matrimonial home thing They thought they had   covered it, and the court case said  and the courts said no Now that is also one of the things where they suspect that the Attorney General 's office knew that that piece of legislation was defective But it didn't suit Matt Russell that it should go through, so he didn't bother changing it <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> That that it also said, on the other hand, uh shall we say there are more than one lawyer in the Government including Dick Spring, and if they were bloody good lawyers they too should have seen   that as well \n<$B>  Mm, <unclear> 3 words </unclear>  \n<$B>  Including Michael D Higgins  \n<$A> Absolutely And they didn't see it so they can't blame your man for   everything  I mean   if they were doing their work uh they were doing their work these things wouldn't happen But until such time as they do amend that, even organisations like AIM, the women 's organisations will be against divorce until such time And they will advise their members to vote against, until such time as they bring that down, because    it 's quite dangerous \n<$B>  Oh no  \n<$B>  And I think the the that the Government are   trying to resolve that I think it 's necessary to resolve it too I agree Where I think they probably will I don't   think \n<$A>  But they but they if they   bring the divorce in before they amend that it 'll fail again, and then it 'll be gone for a whole   generation  not just ten or five years the next time\n<$B>  Mmm  \n<$C> When is it expected to come back up again\n<$B> Oh I didn't say that now\n<$C>   <unclear> 4 words </unclear> \n<$A>  They 're talking in terms of you see   they want it within this, this   Government \n<$C>  This session   yeah\n<$A> But that 's only two years   But it would appear , yeah it would appear as if Matt Thingabob has not hasn't been generating any real work with regard to a new bill\n<$B>  Russell <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>  \n<$B> Well we don't know But uhm, uh Bertie is very interesting on that\n<$A> Hmm\n<$B> And uh I think very clear Uh Bruton I thought was\n<$A> What did   Bruton do \n<$B>  Magnificently   revealing\n<$A>   And how \n<$C>  Can I 've a biscuit  \n<$A> Oh please yes of course\n<$C> How do you mean he was revealing What 'd did   he do \n<$B>  On his   thickness you know\n<$C> On his thickness \n<$A> They say he 's a very bright honest man really\n<$C> Oh I 'm sure   he 's honest Honest, yeah yeah \n<$B>  Well he certainly isn't bright, but he 's not a   good politician though\n<$C> He 's quite he 's a   <unclear> 1 word </unclear> \n<$B>  Oh, he can   put words together\n<$C> He can't\n<$B> He can, because   he didn't take much \n<$A>  Oh God he didn't   He made a holy show   of himself the other day \n<$B>  He can speak much, he can speak much better   than most of them better than Bertie Ahern but anyway\n<$C> Can he\n<$B> Oh he can Sure Bertie Ahern can't speak neither Irish nor English  He can only speak in Dublin\n<$C> Excuse me now you   watch out now, you you bogger you you bogger \n<$B>  It wasn't me That 's all <unclear> 5 words </unclear>   \n<$C> Would you come with me to the pub tonight  To the  the Crossguns Would you go into Dub county there or what like\n<$A> Yeah that 's that 's where   Bertie drinks  It 's a dreadful pub actually now It was a nice pub at one time\n<$C>  Exactly yeah  \n<$C> Oh you 're shocking Where was Bruton from\n<$A> Meath\n<$B> Meath\n<$C> Oh Meath right\n<$B> And he shows it too  But uhm\n<$C> What did he do today in his review\n<$B> What He was being interviewed, and he kept on and kept on saying, we can have no discussions with Labour, of any kind, until, they have declared a position on the principle, of would they, do business with a Government whose ministers, did not were were were collaborators et-cetera\n<$A> Mmm\n<$B> In the Taoiseach 's, deception of the Da/il And he kept on repeating it, that there was no, no way around this and all that, which of course is\n<$C> And what 's he trying to do Basically just   highlight \n<$B>  He he he was   he was trying to    \n<$A>  Drive   a wedge between Fianna Fa/il and   Labour \n<$B>  Of course yeah   But he was also, doing as the interviewer said to him look he says I mean he says the interviewer says to him, eventually and rightly so He says what you 're really saying is, that Dick Spring has to declare, that, he 'll be doing no business with Fianna Fa/il, before you 'll talk to him, and accordingly, if you like if he 's going to stay in Government he has to, kow-tow to you\n<$A> Mm mm mm mm\n<$C> Yeah\n<$B> In other words you 're expecting him to burn his boats and his bridges,   and you 're  laying down what the  what what the  what the Labour party thinking should be, before you will deign to talk to them And of course the interviewer was quite right But it means is that Bruton now can't, he 's ruled himself out because there 's no question of that <unclear> 1 word </unclear>\n<$A>  Mm mm mm  \n<$C> Well to be  I wouldn't think I wouldn't think Dick 'd be going for, uh an alliance with Fine Gael and Bruton   even though Dick might see himself then say in the  Taoiseach 's position, if Bruton was the other,   the person \n<$B>  But he, but Bruton  \n<$A>  He wouldn't   want to give it to him\n<$C> But I I wouldn't think Dick 'd like Bruton as Taoiseach\n<$B> No\n<$A> But Bruton <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$B> But even if and one gets the impression that Fine Gael are anxious to get back into government, by this high-minded drawing a line in the sand et-cetera, there will be no talking, because the principles have got to be   declared  And he kept on repeating this stuff It really means that he 's shutting himself out from real debate, because of course you 've got   to get around these things \n<$A>  Mm mm  \n<$A>  That 's right yeah that 's right  \n<$B> Bertie was away streets ahead, which he is, as well as uhm <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  we 're saying quite clearly, we accept we made a mistake We 're not trying to back out of that What we are asserting is that we, didn't realise the significance of the information, we hadn't time to assess it, and we did not intentionally, uh try to deceive Labour or the Da/il But we know now that we have made a mistake in that matter, and we say it 's up to Dick Spring to either to accept, our veracity on that <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> and we 're just telling him the situation as it is in all honesty   <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  But at least, he was handling this thing in a way that real politics has to work\n<$A>  Mmm yeah  \n<$C> He wasn't holier than thou like Bruton has come across as \n<$B> Sure Dick Spring in the position he 's in at the moment would be nuts, to say to John Bruton oh dear John, thank-you,  I want to assure you I I 'll have nothing to do with those other   people \n<$A>  Now let 's talk   and the other guy saying you 're only getting two Ministers  Having the other, having Dick, burning his boats\n<$B> Oh I 'd say within Fine Gael there 'll be a row about that\n<$A> Mmm\n<$B> Cos essentially they 're out in the cold\n<$C> But they have no real real,   charismatic leader \n<$B>  Well if they wanted to be out in the cold it might be a good strategy  , but I don't think they do want to be out in the cold\n<$A> Mm\n<$C> They 're out in the cold a long time\n<$B> That 's where they 'll be too Cos if Labour and Fianna Fa/il can get together satisfactorily, and try to get proper structures into place, they 've money to deliver cos things are on a high in lots of ways\n<$C> Mm\n<$B> They 've nothing to do but gain Tommy McEllistrim put it that way today when he was asked\n<$A> Did he  How interesting he was asked\n<$B> Mm hmm They were taking Kerry as <.> ki <.> as a kind of a sounding board as a constituency some of them\n<$A> Oh\n<$B> But so uh and Noel Brasil was kind of saying he wouldn't mind if Fianna Fa/il went into opposition soon, McEllistrim said that was a different head altogether\n<$A> I think Smith is probably on his last term anyway\n<$B> That uhm, it would be very, unwise of Bertie, in his view to, leave office at this time if a satisfactory arrangements can be made It 's a good Government and they 're going ahead with a clear programme so,  particularly when, we negotiated the structural funds There 's six billion pounds there over the next few years   Why should we give it, why  should we give it to another crowd to distribute  It 's such a <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> It 's typical\n<$C>  It 's a good time to be there yeah  \n<$B> It 's absolutely typical because there 's another way of looking at it and that is that if Fianna Fa/il ever wanted another chance at all, of getting themselves in order and coming up with a defined definite policy for Fianna Fa/il and, long-term of ever hoping to be the sole Government as a party   again , they should go into opposition\n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A> Maybe\n<$B> And I don't happen to think that Bertie is a national leader Now maybe I hope I 'm wrong, but I don't think that he 'll bring the country with him I think he may be a Dublin guy but he hasn't got what Charlie Haughey had at all\n<$C> Well I don't think many of them   do to  be honest\n<$A>  Mmm  \n<$C> Do you would you like some tea\n<$A> Yes please yeah   I think it 's made actually Yes please  if you would\n<$C>  Will I pour out your water  \n<$C> Will you hand me your cup\n<$B> I don't believe that old Robert Doherty is on anymore anyways\n<$A> You you you 're probably right in this in the present circumstances And if he 's a real problem I mean uh all of them despite themselves have to look at where they 're at and will they be back the next time and things like that But some of them are coming to the end of their, their sell-by date and things like that And there 's the fact that they want to hold on and who can blame them as individuals But when you 're not involved it 's easy to look at the good of the party And I mean I 'm not involved in that way And I would I would actually think that from the party, objectively speaking from the party 's point of view, they could, do with a spell if not two in opposition\n<$B> But Fianna Fa/il have never seen it like   that never \n<$A>  No   I know that   No I know that \n<$C>  But sure   no party likes to be in opposition anyway\n<$B> Fianna Fa/il particularly\n<$A> But then they have been in government so often\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Fine Gael were the ones that were constantly in opposition and they did nicely out of it too But then they lost their heads when they went ahead and did stupid things like appointing their friends and their relatives and my God they 'd loaded the judiciary with people, friends you know And the day they were leaving office they filled appointments Indeedin the day he was leaving office Michael D did precisely that\n<$B> Michael D was only in the office the first term\n<$A> I know but the he the day he thought that the Government was dissolved before that morning, he appointed people on to boards\n<$B> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Well I don't know why I was left out from a cup of tea\n<$C> Cos you weren't finished You were still having you dinner\n<$B> Well I was chewing the chewing the rag, chewing bits of it It was a lovely lunch dinner Thank-you\n<$A> Well I 'll tell you Bronwyn it 's against my principles to go to a pub on a Sunday night, but by God I 'm going tonight to hear what they all have to say\n<$C> To stand up for the ould sod,   for the oul green party, the soldiers of destiny \n<$A>  Absolutely  \n<$B> You can take it

everyone was stopped They got this crane right, and it was kind of like Santa arriving in Brown Thomas Because now you 're never gonna guess Dad, Switzer 's window is no more\n<$B> Oh\n<$C> Ah it 's it 's horrible\n<$A> Switzer 's window isn't any more\n<$C> No because you know they were renovating it or they were redoing it and they can't do the windows So what they 've done is they have kind of a makeshift one in Brown Thomas windows but it 's crap\n<$A> Mmm\n<$C> And it 's terrible It 's awful because   every year we 've always been awful , So anyway   they were  Santa was arriving in Brown

crane will do nicely\n<$A> Mmm Well I remember a being uh Paddy saying to me one time oh years ago I was there was a time I think I was saying to her about uhm being out in Baldonnel looking for apples, and eh the way you I only had the two of you at the time And one of you said to me Edel probably said to me something about uhm how do apples get on trees\n<$B> How do what\n<$A> How do apples get on trees And I said well God puts them there And she said to me and who 's God And I I, I was aghast you see at <unclear> several sylls </unclear> shortly afterwards I mean\n<$B> They might say the same now if you asked them   but go on <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Yeah   shortly afterwards   Ciara and that were here , shortly afterwards Ciara and those were here for dinner one night and I was saying this to Ciara and she says but why were you puzzled For God 's sake I said you 'd think that after being in school for a year she 'd have heard of God even if she didn't hear it at home She says Maggie she says you 're so old-fashioned She says we don't teach about God in school We talk about   baby Jesus in school  So fair enough And then she went on from that and it must 've been in the Autumn Later on we were talking about Santa and that, and I was saying about Santa coming down the chimney And she says gee she says but you 're so old-fashioned She said we have no chimneys in our house They hadn't in this scheme She says all the children in this scheme know, that Santa comes by spaceship  I wouldn't have thought of it But no child nobody in the scheme thought that Santa came by chimney\n<$B>  <unclear> 5 words </unclear>  \n<$C>  Baby Jesus I see  \n<$B> Hard to believe Phil said to me, he says this evening five weeks it 'll be Christmas Eve no Christmas Day he said I must say I hadn't realised <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Well I haven't even thought   about doing anything \n<$B>  And all the work   that 's got to be done before Christmas\n<$C> I suppose you haven't been in town lately so you haven't seen the Christmas   decorations \n<$B>  No  \n<$A> No bar yesterday, now was the nearest I 've been in you know\n<$C> But I mean the decorations have been there for the last few weeks\n<$A> Mmm, What did Jimmy say to you this morning\n<$B> He was very conciliatory   actually \n<$A>  Had they   spotted you before you knocked\n<$B> No I put in the letter before I went out I thought it was better to continue\n<$A> Mm Aisling \n<$B> So I said in the letter I got the biro from you\n<$C> Mm\n<$B> So I wrote the letter and put in the thing cos I knew they they usually take a late Sunday morning\n<$C> Mmm\n<$B> They 're Donnybrookers in that sense\n<$A> Mmm\n<$B> So\n<$A>  Another track coming at me now yeah yeah\n<$B> I put in the letter in the\n<$A> Letterbox\n<$B> Letterbox So I said I 'd call in on my way back So Aisling said she 'd like to come in as well\n<$A> Mm Had they found the letter by the time you actually\n<$B> No actually\n<$A> They were still in bed then\n<$B> But it was twelve o'clock and they usually go to half twelve Mass so I thought I was safe enough on ringing the bell   at that stage  but I wasn't Nell came out in her dressing gown, and your man came out in his bare feet putting on his clothes\n<$A>  Mm mm  \n<$A> Mm\n<$B> So I look and I 'm sorry to disturb you Really I I didn't earlier I put in a letter but, I didn't want to disturb you, but I says we 've a bit of a problem I explained how then, <unclear> several sylls </unclear> to come out and see it so And he came out in his toes you know\n<$A> Yeah yes\n<$B> But, my only unease about it I thought that they 'd take it fairly well but my only unease was in case he 's keeping these Austin Cambridges as kind of, period items for resale you know\n<$A> Mm mm mm\n<$B> Albeit they wouldn't be very usable but\n<$C> Don't like the look of it \n<$B> Well, some people have this, fetish for cars But <unclear> several sylls </unclear>, he said the right thing to Aisling Ah he says for God 's sake don't worry about that and so on He says it 's a good job it wasn't a crash into a car that there was somebody in it\n<$C> Yeah\n<$B> He said and he hoped nothing worse happens to her in her driving career You know he he did very well\n<$A> Mm mm\n<$B> So in a sense I was glad she was there On the other hand I was a bit nervous of her being there in case he got cross\n<$A> Yes yeah yeah\n<$B> Cos it would hit her you know So uh I told him and I showed Jimmy but I says, it is a nuisance and he apologised about it So I was happy And we will repay all the cost, <unclear> several sylls </unclear> But it 's not that\n<$A> She got quite a land alright She came up to me <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and I was asleep And she was asking she  I don't know what she said to me and I turned and I looked at her and I said what did you say And she said it again So I sat up in the bed and I looked at her and I knew it was awfully serious to look at the face And I said Aisling what 's wrong I don't know what you 're talking about And then she said it again, Cos she didn't say anything about a car or having been out Uh she hit Jimmy is I thought what she said you see you know so   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  That 's   probably what she did say\n<$A> Yeah But uh she sat down on the bed then and she was, not quite shaking but not   do you know yeah  quite shocked\n<$C>  Shocked   mm\n<$A> So she went over to Edel then in the afternoon And Edel crashed her car   Totalled \n<$C>  She totalled   her mother 's car\n<$A>  her mother 's car was a total write-off, about a month after Louise got her full  driving licence\n<$B> She went into the back of a car and totalled it You know well I mean if you think the best type of accident to have at this stage You know   a car with no-one in it \n<$A>  It 'll make her careful It 'll make her careful   She admits that she was coming out you see, that car, moves very, the wheel on that you can do an awful lot of things with it that you can't do with mine and she was coming out just that little bit fast and didn't turn the wheel   fast enough  Where my car 's so slow in the off take, that it 'd be less likely to happen you know\n<$B>  Mmm that 's right  \n<$B> Well I I probably was foolish in that but anyhow but I just thought if she, it would give her the feeling if she could take it from the door and do normal driving and come back, when 'tis quiet on a Sunday morning\n<$A> Mmm Ah and you did the right thing certainly, cos she didn't want to go and you called   her again  and she says oh no no I said Aisling if you don't go now you 'll never go again Go on,\n<$B>  No no  \n<$C> When did Trisha ring\n<$A> She rang during the week this   Tuesday or Thursday \n<$C>  Oh did she I wasn't talking to her  \n<$B> I wasn't talking to her at all No I don't think she rang during the week\n<$A> She did ring during the week I uh I told you what night she rang\n<$B> I heard she rang but\n<$A> Yeah it was it was  it was a day uh weekday\n<$B> That was a good while ago\n<$A> Ah it was during last week sometime I wrote to her on Tuesday It was Tuesday night I think she rang\n<$C> It must 've been\n<$B> I 'd say it was probably Tuesday night alright\n<$A> And I had actually written to her that day\n<$C> It would 've been the Wednesday probably because it was the night that I wasn't in\n<$A> Okay it was probably Wednesday   It might have been Wednesday \n<$C>  <unclear> 3 words </unclear>  \n<$B> Ah she won't ring tonight so\n<$C> I know I don't think she 'll ring tonight <unclear> 1 word </unclear>\n<$A> Next Saturday she 'll ring she won't she 'll probably just ring to say when she 's coming I mean\n<$B> Oh that 's five or six weeks away Not at all\n<$C> No, 'tisn't It 's only three Oh no it 's more You 're right\n<$B> About four weeks It 'll be nice for her coming home for her first Christmas   like that then , I always think it is\n<$A>  Mm mm mm

</unclear>   How did your exams go\n<$C> You 've had exams already\n<$A> No continuous assessment Like   not  the main exams are coming at the beginning of January, in the month of January\n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$C> So how 's chemistry going so far\n<$A> Uh it 's not very it 's not too bad I mean there 's some subjects that are absolutely horrible\n<$B> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$C>   Quantum mechanics \n<$A>  There 's no chemistry Ah no no no   there, well we haven't actually started quantum I mean we touched all these things last year but   we , we haven't done it full-time I mean big time this year yet We were just on inorganic really and organic\n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$C> Yeah, physical organic and quantum mechanics\n<$A> Well no actually, he gave us some notes on quantum mechanics but he hasn't gone into it big time yet He has only given us notes, uh for us to be able to do the mathematics behind it which   <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> \n<$C>  That 's just wonderful  \n<$A> Well, so we to understand what 's going on It 's all, determinants and matrices and all that shit\n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> Just for quantum mechanics like you know   I mean \n<$B>  Hey   people I 'm lost \n<$A> No, well there there is\n<$B> So are we \n<$A> But do   you know \n<$C>  Yeah   I know what you mean   All I 'm  saying is, we 're all lost Yeah mechanics   and <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  You know I  \n<$A>  Oh right, it 's just uhm,   well that 's okay That 's fair enough but the subjects  I had exams on on Tuesday one is GLP and the other one was inorganic chemistry I thought I knew my  remember, what day was it I was talking to you\n<$B> Uhm\n<$A> And you asked me to come, and I said no I 've got exams that time Was it the night before my exams or two days before that\n<$B> It was a Thursday or Friday night\n<$A> Oh right okay\n<$B> Of last week\n<$A> Oh right, and I I didn't have time to study or anything\n<$B> No cos you were having people over and then you had the exams on Monday\n<$A> Yeah And then I had the practice thing on   Monday  as well and all that So like I was panicking on Monday night I had only read my inorganic twice so far okay, which was good I suppose considering , you know, considering\n<$C>  Yup  \n<$C> Normal \n<$A> Yeah I suppose, But you know and then I started GLP at about a quarter to ten which is for the laboratory practices And it was the biggest load of waffle I have ever read in my whole entire life The most uninterestingly stupid subject I 've come across\n<$C> Mm hmm\n<$A> It 's just so boring so utterly boring I can't express it enough It 's just horrible   and I need \n<$C>  We   have these little notebooks on lab <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> you know guidelines and that on what to do and   what not to do <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Oh well I mean we we had them   in first year as well like Don't, touch flame or don't stick your hand in the flame That 's fair enough but\n<$B> Avoid wash bottles \n<$A> Oh stop here I used to adore it\n<$C> Oh God \n<$B> Wash bottle   technician \n<$A>  Oh   no no   not I just \n<$B>  Qualified after   four years ' experience\n<$A> Yeah exactly yeah No I 'm not that bad anymore I mean I 'm usually pretty busy in the lab <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and stuff like that But I mean the any odd chance just turn around and squish you know  and I usually get screamed at But uh what was I saying, oh yeah this subject is so uninteresting Started reading it at about quarter to ten, ten o'clock Oh my God there 's no way I can do this There are twelve lectures I 've to get through, each of them consisting of four pages right, well two pages back and front which is four pages, the whole thing filled out nothing like no gaps or lines or anything like that\n<$C> In Maggie 's tiny handwriting \n<$A> It 's not even that tiny I just hate the subject so much I just sit here like scribbling the whole thing down you know And it 's just everything is so repetitive, yet there are very very subtle differences in each sentence You know what I mean And they 're the stupid subtle things I can't remember , so it makes it pretty difficult   you know  So I did big time waffle in that exam And in inorganic, which I thought I kind of knew, and I <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> horrible, but I can kind of consoled myself cos I got my organic results today and I got

well he 's kind of obliged to do all sorts of hours   And , he 's rung up and they 're ringing him at every hand 's turn you know Phoned up the whole time   and \n<$A>  Right yeah  \n<$A>  Well then

{"text": "<Driving>\n\n\n<$A> Did you drive\n<$B> I didn't no I 'm still finding driving very hard to be honest with you I drove we were going out to dinner the other night, and uhm, I was driving fine, but the the car is old and the gears are very hard to change anyhow And I can't park at all because, I can't put that   amount  of effort into my hand And uh, I just couldn't we arrived down we were going for dinner uhm, in a wee place down off George 's Street And 'twas fairly busy and there was a perfect parking space and all I had to do was reverse into it and I couldn't get into reverse I had to stop in the middle of George 's Street get out of the car, let Daniel move over to the driving seat \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> And park it\n<$B> With the entire naturally enough when they saw a woman   driving  the entire, population sitting behind me in the car is going berserk Like I mean you could 've parked a truck,   in  this space but I just couldn't manage the   the  gear change So, I 'm not really kind of taking the car out   that much  He had to drive home then as well I I kind of find that that pulling on it, is just too sore\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yeah Mam hurt her hand She fell over a caddy car She was golfing Don't ask  I am telling you it was so embarrassing\n<$B> Not big enough for her   yeah \n<$C>  Tall   woman \n<$A> She is tiny But anyway she fell over and she couldn't change the gears in the car but she had to drive So she 'd take Padraig, and she 'd go okay I 'm pressing the clutch and he had to change them   for her \n<$B>  When   we were coming down uhm town that 's what I was   doing  And I was going, press the clutch <unclear> 1 word </unclear>   and he cos he  wouldn't be familiar with uh, gearshift   anyhow  because,   he 'd normally  drive automatic And I 'm there going first That 's not first \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear>  \n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> And the gears is going \n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> And I 'm going no no no This is not working at   all  So in the end it was easier for him to drive\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yeah or else you 're here trying to steer with your left and reach your right the whole way   over here \n<$B>  Oh yeah, yeah   which doesn't, it 's uh driving 's not it 's not that bad now but, I can't park unless I 'm just driving into a big long space which very often in town you 're not going to find something   you can glide into  And I definitely cannot put it into reverse My hand just I if I can just get my right hand over But I 've not got a lot of power in my   right hand  I 've to get my right hand over and try and put the car in reverse  When I thought about it though oh God out in the middle   of George 's Street  I was mortified I really was embarrassed And then I was saying that to you we were walking up George 's Street on Friday, uhm, I met Daniel after college and and we were just walking back up uhm to Rathmines We were coming up George 's Street and it was, after five Like it was a busy time And uh this motor bike came flying out from the middle of I do not know where right underneath a car\n<$D>  Definitely not yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  George 's Street yeah  \n<$A> Oh was he alright\n<$B> He wasn't actually He wasn't too good at all But the poor girl driving the car was in   bits Oh she was  absolutely I felt I mean I know it was terrible for him but I felt so sorry for her\n<$A>  Bits Oh Jesus  \n<$A> Yeah at least it had happened to him\n<$B> Yeah she   was just \n<$A>  That 's not   some consolation to   her \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$B> There was nothing anybody could 've done It was very, it was wet and oily and it had been raining It had been that Friday it had been absolutely lashing and it was very wet And, the two of them were kind of travelling, but even if they hadn't been, you know, it wouldn't 've really mattered He just went, he just came directly right under her car He came off the bike The bike hit the car, and he came right under her wheels\n<$C> Oh man\n<$A> I know\n<$B> And me being mega cool of course,  I 'm there going, oh God oh God And I 'm there I 'm kind of, hanging onto Daniel and then I 'm going right right, I 'm a nurse  Right, we 're going over to have a look Right Are are we ready  You 'd swear I was going in to perform surgery \n<$A> And he 's there, am I ready am I ready   and we 're not ready We 're  not ready You 're not ready I can see you 're not ready\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Oh God, I felt such an eejit Thought about <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> But it 's just, it wasn't even that I didn't really see him go under at all I just heard it\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> And it was the most horrific sound But I think he had so much he had all he had all the gear on all the leather, stuff on, so I think that probably saved him, quite a lot of damage obviously He he was, sort of conscious He wasn't really conscious I 'd say he was fine you know I 'd say he was It was a bit horrific now\n<$A> It was very scary\n<$B> Oh yeah You can't imagine I mean she was, she was so hysterical She really was I felt really sorry for her You know and she was kind of there going she, you know saying there was nothing I could do And there   wasn't  anything she could do But still like I felt sorry for her\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Sure you know like if a dog runs out in front of you   And  you run, you know the way dogs come at the side of the car and they just go under   your back wheel , and you can't do anything about and the dog is dead And you 're here like going but I couldn't do anything And you feel   so bad \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  Yeah oh yeah  \n<$B>  You feel, I you 've murdered   something\n<$A> Yeah\n<$C> Mm\n<$B> We were coming up the road I was bringing my mother up She wanted to get wallpaper or something a couple of weeks ago And I was driving up, the main road  a fairly busy road and this dog was crossing it Now the dog would 've had time to dance across the road never mind walk across it My mother , eventually spotted it I had spotted him from way back but she hadn't spotted it until much much later She grabs my arm  on the gear like I had my, hand sitting on top of   the gear  stick She grabs my arm and pulls it  Now my, my gear arm was kind of over on my mother 's lap And I 'm would you let go  I see it It 's fine And she 's here going nearly cutting the circulation off going, oh God Easy to know she 'd never been a driver like Oh dear God <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$C> Right You 've put me off driving now\n<$B> Ah no driving 's grand\n<$C> Right It 's very nerve-wracking\n<$B> Ah you get used to it I remember when I was, like when I was learning how to drive and kind of coming through town and uh, traffic lights of course were the big you know boo-boo And I 'm there and I 'd see these traffic lights, you know kind of down at the end of the road and they 'd be green  and of course I 'd speed up\n<$A> Yeah \n<$B> I didn't want to have to stop cos then the car was going to conk out So you 'd come haring up to these traffic lights at a ridiculous speed and then they 'd change and then you 've to hit  the brakes  And nearly kill the poor devil that 's beside you So we were coming up to these traffic lights My brother was teaching me how to drive And we were coming up, those the traffic lights were red so I had to stop anyhow There was a car in front of me And Tadhg goes, now I 'm coming up I had intentions of stopping obviously this car was stopped in front of me, and Tadhg goes Ais hit the brakes And I was kind of thinking oh I 'll hit them in a minute, And he goes Ais hit the brakes, Ais And I was still driving on  Hit the fucking brakes  And of course then I lammed on the brakes, went into floods of tears got out of the car, in the middle of the street in town going I 'm not driving any more  being the kind of calm female that I am We arrived home anyhow He drove home, neither of us speaking to each other of course And uhm we we were both still living at home at the time, and that was the end of that My mother says no way  either one of ye move out of the house, or you stop teaching  her how to drive because it was just causing such Oh 'tis impossible I think when a member of your family\n<$D>   Yeah  my dad used to get so mad\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$D> Yeah Oh, I wouldn't talk to him and he wouldn't talk to me And I 'd be going back to Dublin <unclear> 1 word </unclear> in   floods of tears  'Twasn't that bad like\n<$B>  Are you serious  \n<$B> Yeah\n<$D>   Forgotten now \n<$B>  And what and he   used to kind of yell at you or that\n<$D> Yeah And it was, the the brake   thing  I usen't to drive I used to drive on the main road on Sunday morning There was no cars\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Yeah\n<$D> If a car was like, twenty-five hundred yards in front of me, I used to slow down, and pull into the side like  I 'd be afraid I 'd bash into it If one came up if one passed me out I 'd go I 'd  nearly be in the field beside you know Oh I used to get I still get hysterical but, I don't drive very often   either <unclear> 3 words </unclear> \n<$B>  I don't think it 's a good   idea to let a member of your family teach you\n<$C> Especially a male member\n<$A> Unless well my Dad taught me and then my mother took over But I think it 's different for me I used to drive from Newmarket to Ballybunion which is a good forty miles\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> I 'd just get in the car in Newmarket and they 'd tell me I had to go to Ballybunion\n<$B> Mm\n<$A> And in fact it 's such a it 's a desperate road now It 's the worst road possible It 's all windy wind,  Windy winds, windy bends It 's really bad So there isn't an opportunity to get out of the car and let somebody take over So you 're   stuck there  You have to drive it, and you 've to cross the main roads I remember I used to hate that I used to be so scared\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Coming from a kind of by-road   onto a \n<$A>  Yeah yeah   coming from a by-road onto a main road   You cross it  And you 'd like you go on the main road for about like that much and then you 've to cross off it, and it 's a blind bend I still hate that   blind bend , I mean as my mother goes you go up to it You look as best as you can and you put your foot down and you go\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Oh God yeah  \n<$B> Yeah like what can you do\n<$A> Oh yeah I mean people have got killed on that bend so much Put your foot down and go But I think that was how I learned She just made me   drive  Even at they used make me drive a lot on my own, which I used to hate doing You know when you 're you 're provisional and you 're not allowed\n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B> Mm\n<$A> But I remember they used make me drive on my own, up and down the town And we 're always sent for parts everywhere cos like Dad has a garage Say he 'd send me off to Charleville like for windscreens and bumpers and <&> laughter <&> shit like that And I 'd be here like driving away like Hello I 'm from Philip Garavan 's Looking for a back bumper there please  Who the hell is this He still does it He sends me off for a windscreen He sent me for a windscreen to Charleville And I went into this man Hello I 'm looking for Fergus He was painting I didn't presume he was Fergus He was painting the wall Looking for Fergus And he goes yeah And I just went where 's Fergus  I am Fergus I I beg your pardon I 'm from Philip Garavan 's and I 'm looking for a windscreen Can you point it out He put it in the car right in such a way, I was like driving and the car the windscreen was coming that way but if it slipped it was going to cut my jugular That 's all I could think of the whole way home And it 's a really bad road Cos he told me, drive down <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> go on You 'll be fine, but when you 're coming home make sure you go slow and don't break it", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

everything \n<$B>  Well, well   we wouldn't say so But   I suppose we are really  \n<$A>  But, by by comparison   with with   with  with most other professionals\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Yeah, yerra you would be you would   yeah yeah \n<$A>  <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear>  \n<$B> The   only  the only quibble we would have now is that, we 're when you 'd be temporary,   you 'd be  on first year 's salary\n<$A>  Oh right right  \n<$A>  Oh right  \n<$B> Oh right so you 're actually back on   back on your basic <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  You 're back just on your basic   And, but last year now it was based on two years for which you had worked two years We 'll say, two years at random We 'll say take eighty-six eighty-seven, they 'd think you had worked such a percentage of them, that you 'd start on the fourth, rung of the scale, so I qualified for that And about twenty pound a week   more,  you know And we got backpay then then but of course we 're getting backpay for a few years and next thing we got none to date since <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> last January for what you worked you 'll say We 'll say we only got what one hundred and thirty or forty pound That 's nothing  On the social fare well then Uh last year about November last year they brought out a letter, to say the equal opportunity for men and women and equal pay, and that uh, fill in if I thought I was entitled to something Sure I didn't know in the hell if I was or wasn't I filled it in anyway Didn't we get three hundred and thirty-seven   pounds  And, I got a note then to say that was only half of what I was due\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$D>  Right  \n<$D> Right\n<$B> Oh, I was there was two hundred and something, coming to me However a week after I got another three hundred and thirty-seven pounds I bought   a video  and that was it \n<$A>  <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> was paying big money  \n<$A> The State paid big money there alright\n<$B> What\n<$A> The State paid big money on that That <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> there a   European case  there <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$B>   yeah  \n<$B> Yeah yeah, and like we wouldn't know except for we got the   notification There 's no  way I would 've applied for it cos I hadn't a clue But uhm, so I 'd say I should 've only got two hundred and something the second time\n<$A>  Yeah but <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>  \n<$D> You can't give it back now anyway \n<$E> Give them the video instead\n<$D> The video the video 'd have to be <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> if they want it\n<$A> <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> this  equality thing now you know <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> Michael Noonan, above now watching to make sure anything or mentions it male and female and   everything you know \n<$B>  Yes  \n<$D> Oh yeah\n<$B> Yes, mm\n<$A> The <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the women used be packing packing above with us you see And they used be packing <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> packing quite often, when the packing was busy Then it got slack But the men were in then loading containers Next thing they put out an argument anyway <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear>    There  was no more about it anyway after that They wanted equality alright but not not the same work   You see  that 's a different thing altogether\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  I know  \n<$B> Yeah yeah\n<$E> You you 've a bee in your bonnet anyway about   that \n<$A>  Oh   no because because I think that the whole thing is is is unfair cos the men were doing the heavy work and they were working shifts, and <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear>\n<$E> And why in the hell shouldn't they because they 've the strength\n<$A> But sure they 're not equal then   if men have strength sure, they shouldn't be equal\n<$E> But they 're more equal   you see in certain ways \n<$A>  They can't   have it every way like\n<$B> There is no comparison between like for lifting   now or You know you know  where you 'd have men in the wards Really they 're great\n<$A>  Right, sure <unclear> 7 sylls </unclear>  \n<$E> Sure I remember   at home, a hundredweight of sugar out of the boot of the car it 'd kill me And Ken could throw it over his shoulder like , you know\n<$A>  <unclear> several words </unclear>  \n<$B> Ah, there 's no comparison\n<$E> And you know it 's wrong really because women 's women 's backs aren't fit for that at all\n<$A> But sure then 'tis the women who claim to be equal That 's what I can't understand   They can't have it both \n<$F>  Putting in the same effort \n<$E>  But sure they are  \n<$A> Huh\n<$F> Putting in the same effort\n<$A> Different jobs\n<$F> Yeah but the load of effort is the same But they put the same amount of work in as a man is\n<$A> They should be paid in proportion to what they do not in proportion   for equality  with with with the other person\n<$E>  They shouldn't  \n<$E> The fact that you are male and that you have uh more uhm strength in actual fact doesn't make you superior\n<$A> No no it shouldn't no\n<$F> So you shouldn't be paid more\n<$E> They say you shouldn't be paid more for what 's God-given, same as if we 're not If we were mental handicapped whatever, you don't expect us to work and the whole lot We should still be paid and should still have the rights\n<$B> Ah is there, is there uh   Kate Kate \n<$D>  That 's   why the lady 's <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$B> Is there a a Mullane one working in the, what do you call uh a kind of a secretary with the nuns down in Rathdrum\n<$E> No she 's not any more, Deborah\n<$B> She 's not any more\n<$E> No\n<$B> Is she

know just ready to call you basically after that\n<$C>  And  \n<$C> Aye We got in touch with him anyway whether or not he called me   you know   So   what did he say \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D>  So, very promising   Very promising\n<$C> Really\n<$D> Yeah   He was  saying that uhm, he thought it would be complicated cos Clarisse is abroad\n<$C>  Excellent  \n<$C> Mm\n<$D> But uh because I 'm earning enough,   I  can just put the mortgage in my   name , or you know organise the mortgage through my accounts or whatever\n<$C>  Mhm  \n<$C>  Mhm  \n<$C> Yeah\n<$D> And if she 's got enough for the deposit But he wouldn't tell me how much she had\n<$C> She oh she does Do you not know how much she has\n<$D> No I haven't a clue\n<$C> Oh, well she 's got five thousand with him It 'll be about well actually it 'll be about four thousand \n<$D> And is that all usable\n<$C> Uhm, yes and then she 's got another three thousand in somewhere else And that was her   resettlement  fund But she 's got plenty for the   uhm \n<$D>  Uh-huh  \n<$D>  Right   Well he said it would be kind of I can't go over a house for seventy-six thousand\n<$C> Right\n<$D> Uh judging my salary or whatever\n<$C> Mhm\n<$D> And uh the deposit would be about four and legal fees whatever you know So it 'd probably come up to about five\n<$C> Yeah\n<$D> But I can always get a loan anyway you know But he   said  you know, you can't  you know they won't touch you if you 're getting a loan to pay your deposit   But to come  to him and he can put me in on if we get loans from local banks\n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$C>  No That 's right  \n<$C> Yeah\n<$D> It 's not uh, you know it doesn't show up or something like that\n<$C> Yeah\n<$D> Yeah\n<$C> Yeah they will like They really do go through all your all your accounts and make sure you 're sort of, soluble and stuff  I know Gordon Well done\n<$D> Yeah So uhm when 're you moving into yours\n<$C> Well we don't know yet We 're still doing the whole mortgage application nonsense    So  it 'll still be another few weeks like but hopefully really fucking soon   I 'm so  sick of this flat \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D> I can't wait to see it\n<$C> I know I know I can't wait for you to see it\n<$D> Yeah\n<$C> So have you been looking at places   What 's what 's your limit  Seventy-six\n<$D>  I haven't looked yet Mm  \n<$D> Seventy-six yeah\n<$C> Right\n<$D> So I want to look at ones between sixty and seventy-five kind of thing   advertised  so that I can see the difference in, the standard that I 'm getting or whatever you know\n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$C> Yeah yeah totally Were you still thinking of Ormeau Road\n<$D> Uh yeah, and maybe like around your area\n<$C> Yeah I   think you should  cos you 'll probably be I know totally It 'll probably be a lot better value,   you know  because if you 're looking at sort of sixty seventy on the Ormeau Road, I don't really think, you know, the standard that you 're you 're going to   get  is is so good there really\n<$D>  We could be neighbours  \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D> Well there 's also Finaghy as well I don't mind   I  like living up around here you know\n<$C>  Really  \n<$C> Oh aye Oh God are you actually in Finaghy\n<$D> Well I 'm only five minute walk from Finaghy\n<$C> God yeah I never really thought about that   That 's  so weird \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D> Yeah yeah\n<$C> Yeah\n<$D> Would Clarisse want to live up there\n<$C> Well I sent her an email just telling her all the craic and told her to, to like let me know, exactly what she 's looking for,   you know  I said basically three plus bedroom   hopefully  Ormeau Road maybe Blessington maybe Forestside,   as far  out as Forestside but hopefully that area and, uhm, if if not you know I 'm I 'm looking kind of around this area too you know   Upper  Lisburn Finaghy\n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$C>  Mm  \n<$C>  Mhm  \n<$C>  Yeah absolutely  \n<$C> Yeah I mean even like talking to Brendan and just looking round ourselves we really did see that you know the houses on the Lisburn Road totally unaffordable   Can't even go there \n<$D>  Yeah And they 're   a big pile of shite anyway\n<$C> They are I mean they really are but like Ormeau Road is pretty much getting there you know They 're just going to be really really out-priced  that you know, not not quite   but \n<$D>  Yeah   well they 're starting to be already,   you know \n<$C>  They really   are like ridiculous prices for you know the shittiest little houses   you know <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$D>  You know   that one we lived, Ava Street\n<$C> Yeah\n<$D> I think it went it was advertised for about seventy-five or something\n<$C> Really\n<$D> Yeah\n<$C> God It just is mental\n<$D> I know And like it 's shitty\n<$C> I know I know and that was well I suppose that was what was that three bedrooms But then, Mairead 's room was in the attic wasn't it\n<$D> Yeah that was kind   of converted  like but it shouldn't really be a bedroom   you know  You can't stand up in it like \n<$C>  Mm  \n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$C> I know \n<$D> That was the one she chose    I 'll choose the one  I can crawl in and out of \n<$C>  Mairead is  \n<$D> I know I know but I really do think like you should have a good look around the Blessington Road cos there are you   know  The reason why there are good bargains there is because of where it is like\n<$D>  Yeah but  \n<$D> Yeah but uhm I mean there are little pockets of\n<$C> Mm\n<$D> Of sort of Proddy pockets or whatever you know that I   don't want \n<$C>  There kind of   are but not  definitely not where we 've moved in to you   know I can't \n<$D>  Yeah   how do you know\n<$C> Well because I know people who have moved in there quite recently   Ehm , Ronan Have you ever met Ronan\n<$D>  Uh-huh  \n<$D> Yes Wee Ronan\n<$C> Wee Ronan yeah He lives there now And a girl called Sally who sort of half-caste She lives there now and she 's Catholic\n<$D> Right\n<$C> And you know it 's really really starting to get that way,   around  that bit Maybe not the Cregagh Road Well definitely not the   Cregagh Road but definitely around  straight off  the Blessington Road, Definitely it 's quite   mixed , But you know not to say that we 'd ever be going to any of the bars there \n<$D>  Okay  \n<$D>  Well no I don't, I wouldn't consider it  \n<$D>  Mhm  \n<$D> No\n<$C> Yes do you know what I mean You 'd need to have UDA tattooed   across your forehead \n<$D>  What what   part of the road are you on Can you describe it for me\n<$C> Uhm, do you know, like it 's sort of, straight ahead of you know where Worthington Embankment stops, on   the Blessington  Road It 's pretty much there It 's like between, where the gates are to the Oulton Square and where the, uhm, BIFHE place   is  It 's pretty much just straight there   you know  You just have to walk about thirty seconds and would be like right at the gates of the Oulton   Square  So it is like straight off Blessington Road and about ten doors down\n<$D>  Yes  \n<$D>  Uh-huh  \n<$D>  Right right  \n<$D>  Uh-huh  \n<$D> Right That 's only like ten minute walk then from, Ormeau   Road too \n<$C>  From the   Ormeau Road totally yeah   It 's quite a nice walk , if it 's if if it 's during the day like\n<$D>  Through the park lovely  \n<$D> Yeah\n<$C> So, I mean you know that 's that 's why, why we took it I was just wasn't prepared to go any more East Belfast than that\n<$D> No Cos Sarah-Jane 's sister lives sort of round the corner up up uh, My Fair Lady 's Road or something\n<$C> My Lady 's Road yeah\n<$D> My Lady 's Road \n<$C> Stanley you know Stanley the hairdresser He lives just off he lives uhm just off My Lady 's Road as well\n<$D> Yeah\n<$C> Yeah so it is you know getting to be, a sort of okay area for,   people  like us \n<$D>  Mm  \n<$D> But I, you see I don't have a clue   about  certain areas You know you could only kind of judge them by  , snotty-nosed kids running around \n<$C>  Mm  \n<$C>  I know, Well I do And   even if you 're thinking about looking at somewhere I 'll tell you what sort of an area it is   cos I  really do know around there really really well, But you need to be right off the Blessington Road No further in than that like\n<$D>  Right", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "42e8fd17-bbe1-4cf7-86d4-f6231fc86960", "added":

is there around   Forestside \n<$B>  It 's   uh well no there 's loads\n<$A> Is there\n<$B> Yeah and they 're all like family homes kind of with gardens and garages and shit like that for,  well I 've seen them advertised between seventy plus kind of thing\n<$A> Really\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> God\n<$B> Which is you know, just up the road really from   Ormeau \n<$A>  Yeah   yeah totally\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> So is Clarisse not   thinking about \n<$B>  What   about Rosetta\n<$A> Uhm oh I think it will be too expensive round Rosetta\n<$B> Really\n<$A> Yeah I mean oh God \n<$B> What happened   there \n<$A>  There 's cardboard   tubes just fell down  Uhm no is uh, is not sort of a bit more sort of well it 's either Protestant estates or, nice family homes semi-detached with gardens   that are  pretty you know   expensive  You know Mairead 's mum 's kind of style   I  think so anyway like\n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  Okay </3[> \n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> But I think it 's it 's more Proddy than anything \n<$B> Yeah even up around Finaghy you know you 've got your wee pockets and stuff\n<$A> Yeah I know I know But yeah you do just have to to have to be aware  You don't want to end up in this, Protestant enclave \n<$B> No I don't like cos I don't want to you know I want just just want to feel comfortable,   you know in the area I 'm in \n<$A>  I know I know   Absolutely I know I didn't I didn't want to do the whole sort of, you 've got to be a Protestant to live here kind of   thing you know  I kind of have but I sort of took faith in the fact that you know I 've got a few Catholic friends living round me so that 's   okay   No but it is I mean I used to live like right off My Lady 's Road   and you know  whenever I first bought a house And it was so Protestant you know\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B> Mm\n<$A> Unbelievably so But it just seems to be really really relaxing now which is good\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> So when do you think you 're going to start looking Are you   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  Well I phoned   up about uhm a couple today   around  the Finaghy area, but there were both under offer\n<$A>  Uh-huh  \n<$A> Really yeah yeah\n<$B> And the I I actually went last night to take a peek at one of them\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> Cos it 's not far from here\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> And it looked great\n<$A> Really\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> God\n<$B> It was it looked huge Massive big front garden and back  you know really private back garden patio\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> Extended new kitchen out the back   uhm summer seat \n<$A>  Mm, see   that 's probably what you 'll find out there cos it 's  you know it 's a bit further outside Belfast so therefore they are going to be cheaper than than the Ormeau Road\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Do you know what I mean You 're going to get be able to get bigger houses\n<$B> Yeah but just now that I 'm used to, living out here you know   what 's  another ten minute walk up the road Do you   know what I mean \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah   totally\n<$B> And Finaghy 's got all the amenities and stuff and it 's, it 's, well there 's certain pockets there supposed to be very sort of middle upper class aren't there   You know \n<$A>  Yeah I know   It is, You have to make sure that 's what Clarisse wants as well\n<$B> I know\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Oh I know I 'm just uh I just want to keep looking for maybe a month or two\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> And just look and look and see You know Brendan said just keep looking and see what you expect what you should expect for that kind of money   so that  you know what kind of offer to put in like  ,  So if I get serious about any uh I 'll call on you to come and help me look\n<$A>  Absolutely  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Och do totally I 'd love to\n<$B> Mm have you any free time Are you on

to sit on the settee and read magazines and watch TV \n<$B> Charming\n<$A> Charming I know But uhm tomorrow night, uhm, Daithi/ is no not Daithi/ 's not having a party his friends are having a party   And \n<$B>  Who   Wee Daithi/\n<$A> Wee Daithi/ yes Fred and Tom are having a party up on the Antrim Road, and apparently there 's going to be decks and stuff there So I 'm definitely going to go cos

night\n<$A>  Oh yeah that 's right  \n<$A> Ah\n<$B> Which is just nonsense\n<$A> It kind of is isn't it\n<$B> Yeah But Bad Manners is on and then Crescent Arts is on after that\n<$A> I know it is I know and I was just   torn between \n<$B>  Mm and I was   hoping you 'd go\n<$A> I know And I was going to but then we heard about this party and I think it is actually going to be really good\n<$B> Uh-huh\n<$A> So it 'd be really good if you could come up afterwards or something\n<$B> Right Give me the hold on and   I 'll get a pen \n<$A>  I mean I don't know   the address I don't   know I 'll have to tell you tomorrow \n<$B>  Oh you don't know Okay   Well just text it to me tomorrow\n<$A> Yeah I mean the only thing is it 's on the Antrim Road But I really do think it 's going to be dead good\n<$B> How far up\n<$A> Uhm I really don't know\n<$B> Mm\n<$A> Honestly, but uhm, yeah any parties we 've been to you know with them has been just the best\n<$B> Right\n<$A> So I mean, we 'll probably get there like while you 're at the Crescent so I 'll text you and let you know anyway whether it 's good or not\n<$B> Sound\n<$A> So at least you can come to a party that 's good\n<$B> Yeah  and you might end up in the Crescent\n<$A> Probably \n<$B> And what about Saint Paddy 's day\n<$A> Well, I figure we 're definitely going to go for a few drinks or something,   Like  fiddle-de-dee or   something What do you think \n<$B>  Well  \n<$B>  Mhm, there 's   parades and all on   downtown at  half one\n<$A>  Is there  \n<$B> Yep\n<$A> What kind of parades\n<$B> I don't know Belfast 's biggest parades ever apparently \n<$A> Really\n<$B> Yep \n<$A> What are people doing\n<$B> What\n<$A> Wearing green and being Irish What do they do\n<$B> Well Jessie 's trying to get a posse together   to  uhm sort of meet up and, go down town and go round all like the John Hewitt and bars like that you know and listen to fiddle-de-dee   It 's  going to be bunged like but, sure\n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Och yeah I think that 'd be good Even just a few pints or something to see how long we can last after Saturday night \n<$B> Yeah, aye right enough Sure we could go straight there from Saturday night \n<$A> Well we could do yeah absolutely Oh God Oh God  No definitely I 'm so up for like going out on Sunday I 'd kill myself if I didn't Don't ever not go out on Saint Patrick 's   Day It  has to be done\n<$B>  I know  \n<$B> Have you heard from Clarisse recently\n<$A> No I haven't actually She doesn't send me emails anymore \n<$B> I haven't heard from   her in a week  or something Yeah She was sending me quite regular ones cos I 'm on  email every day you know I can   I 've  access to it now whereas before it was like once a month you know\n<$A>  Does she write to you  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yeah have you been uhm looking at estate agents uhm on the internet\n<$B> No\n<$A> Cos they 're really really good\n<$B> Are they up-to-date\n<$A> Totally up-to-date Brilliant Much better than than the papers and stuff that you get\n<$B> Oh right\n<$A> Yeah I must uhm   I 'll email you the addresses of them all \n<$B>  Is it Property News Property News   dot com\n<$A> They aren't actually that good\n<$B> Right\n<$A> Because uhm, I think because they collate so many other estate agents into their newspaper that you know they can be really behind\n<$B> Mhm\n<$A> Whereas all the actual specific ones uhm, especially in East Belfast anyway you know Pooler Watson Cowley Groves and and estate agents like that   they 're  always really up-to-date\n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B> Right\n<$A> And probably somewhere round the Ormeau Road as well But I 'll email you the addresses of them anyway so that you can have a look\n<$B> Okay mhm That 'll be good Aye just send it on to me\n<$A> So what was Clarisse saying\n<$B> Uhm, when was it I think it was about a week ago I heard from her\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> Or so I 'm damned if I can remember  We kind of have wee conversations now like you know It 's not it 's not tell me about   your whole last month  you know\n<$A>  What 're you doing   yeah Is she okay anyway And she 's doing the teaching and all and\n<$B> Yeah she was saying she missed her, her friends from Maris from the old school that she was working in\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> So maybe she doesn't see them so regularly\n<$A> Yeah cos whenever I was speaking to her on the phone she said she was quite lonely,   because  just you know she didn't have people to talk to all day at work   She 's  just kind of doing it by herself I can totally understand that cos that 's kind of what I 'm doing  She 's got no no work colleagues anymore It 's really really weird   you know  Really strange But uhm, yeah\n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Is she doing just private then, in in the evening\n<$A> Huh\n<$B> Is she doing just private in the evening\n<$A> I think so yeah\n<$B> And then all day Saturday apparently\n<$A> Yeah I think so Seems strange\n<$B> Yeah Mightn't look good on a employment record,   as well \n<$A>  No I   I, kind of think that she isn't really making the most of it anymore That she 's just kind of staying there cos that 's what 's familiar   Do you  know what I mean\n<$B>  Yeah", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "af80db42-ce4e-4fb9-b96a-46ef25bc5e24", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.222871+00:00"}

thirteen thousand mile one six\n<$A>  How much  \n<$A> Really\n<$B> One thousand six hundred and he 's going to he 's thinking about buying it for the trip basically you know   Cos  it 'd be cheap for him to  insure It 's that 's  it 's  best option insurance-wise for just passing his test you know\n<$A>  Right  \n<$A> Uh-huh\n<$B> So\n<$A> It 'll be a good bike It 'll you know I would like to buy one like that\n<$B> There 's thirteen it 's he would rather have one with low miles lower miles But it 's not too bad\n<$A> Well that would be a big  step up for me, even\n<$B> Why sure yours has got   sixteen thousand hasn't it \n<$A>   mines   is twenty thousand over\n<$B> Oh has it Well, you I don't know you might not like it It 's got a bit of a fairing at the front\n<$A> Ah Can you not take that off\n<$B> He would you can't really no It 's got a square  it 's got the light and all attached to it But it 'll be far better for the journey cos you 'll need a wee bit of, protection   So \n<$A>  Mm   That chain I bought wasn't a split link chain\n<$B> I didn't think it would be\n<$A> Well I that 's what I asked for\n<$B> So did you not get it done then\n<$A> Uhm, well he hammered out the links right\n<$B> It 's a rough job actually I done that before\n<$A> He no I watched him do it He did it very very professionally He knows exactly what he 's at like you   know  He used to race bikes like He   said he 'd be  doing working on chains every, every week like And uh he said he 'd he 'd have it all sort of set up for me next week And if I go down at five o'clock on Tuesday an hour before the class begins then we can get really stuck into it and he 'll get it sorted then He says he can just cut off the chain that 's on it\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Oh very good  \n<$B> Yep\n<$A> Or whatever, and just put it all on intact instead of, oh no put it on kind of hanging off Do you know what I mean \n<$B> Not really but you 've to get new  you 've got new sprockets haven't you\n<$A> Hmm\n<$B> You 've new sprockets\n<$A> Aye I do aye\n<$B> Oh that 's alright\n<$A> But uh I tightened the chain then on Tuesday night just to give me some practice like and uh it 's terrible\n<$B> Why\n<$A> The you can feel the the back wheel isn't straight    But uh \n<$B>  Did   you not do it in his class\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> Did you not do it in his class\n<$A> I did aye, but he was helping me measure it and everything and then, he went off and I finished the job like \n<$B> Don't like the sound of that\n<$A> I know\n<$B> He 'll maybe well I hope he knows what he 's doing but you 'd maybe be better taking it to, somebody proper to and say right put this chain on for me\n<$A> No he knows like\n<$B> Okay\n<$A> He said see you know when he puts on, this chain he 's going to get it exactly perfect you know for because, he 's saying it 's like one millimetre out, the tyre he said uh you know when he   looked at it there \n<$B>  The tyre aye   the chain wears differently and all The chain wears badly and   stuff <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>  But uhm, just saying I probably won't see you now but in between now and going away cos I 'm just I 'm on every day I think\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Aye

Yeah   then you 're able to run her to the hospital and that as well   I guess Yeah \n<$A>  Well exactly   That 's why I stayed up the   practical that stuff as well you know as well as that yeah You know so that 's all the \n<$B>  Yeah, Thinking that yeah   Uh-huh And so he 's still inside then\n<$A> He 's still in Dundonald yeah   He  should be getting out tomorrow   So  touch wood uhm,   that 'll  that 'll all go according to plan like   you know  But uh\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B> God he 's really had the time of it hasn't he\n<$A> He 's just had a crap year you know His health 's not the best until he goes on dialysis which   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>  these recurring effects   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>  cos his system 's just fucked you   know  On the minimum And if he 's got he definitely needs dialysis quite   soon  you know you are going to pick up infection   with toxins  and in the blood   It 's  going to be inevitable you know   unfortunately  But uhm he 's got a  bearing up well Like I mean he was fine cos uh he was out last week doing the gardening and stuff   and you know , going for walks And he may be overdoing it a bit you   know as well so uh \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  God shit  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B>  Yeah, sounds   like you have the cold\n<$A> I 've got

bad yet   It 's  only really today yesterday and today my eyes were itchy That 's all I 've had\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yeah this is the same It 's really hit me just coming home there   I  was fine all day And uhm   it 's one  of those things when you don't think about it I know it sounds stupid like   but uh \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B>  Yeah well   I think well maybe if you were indoors all day and then you just came out   that 's  probably why And then the evening I think is worse And they say   that 's  cos the pollen is settling\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Oh definitely   cos Gary  got a blaster here so uh So like come here then Lisa has been taken away by the baby <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>   and was  screeching the place down like\n<$B>  I think  \n<$B>  Oh cool  \n<$B> I know I phoned a wee while ago and she was howling  so   she was \n<$A>  Yeah  , been howling for like two or three hours Think she might 've <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> \n<$B> Oh God    Oh

well there but I think she was like going berserk like No it was her first day at creche today   so \n<$B>  Oh   really,   Oh my God \n<$A>  Yeah so   it 's so weird like Uhm so I had to kind of uh leave her in for a few hours And I leave her in tomorrow for a couple of   hours  just to get her used to it  , And uhm , bring cos uh unfortunately just she 's been up in Belfast this week She was supposed to have a whole week this week before she goes in next week but   uh  it didn't happen So   uh  I wanted rather than just leave her in on Tuesday for the full day   like  bye-bye which 'd be worse for   me  and her   obviously  Yeah so I think that 's put her out of sorts   not going well you know But uh  heard she was okay great She was upset for the first couple of hours   but I  hear she 's there she 's off again  She was upset for the first couple of hours   but  uh settled in afterwards So then when I came she was there she was uh asleep on her baby beanbag \n<$B>  Uh-huh

say is you are blessed with uh what do they call it Not like a high-maintenance child It 's something even more euphemistic   uh   with uh uh a child who needs a lot of    love   Like it 's a screaming small baby   <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  But uhm\n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Oh God And   what 's it like being back at work\n<$A> I am not back at work yet   They do \n<$B>  Oh

parents coming down to me and all this kind of   thing you know , And you know the guards, and I mean him going out and buying it He 'd be stupid enough to get   caught  So he was not at all amused,   so I was glad of that \n<$B>  Mm, mm  \n<$B>  Mm mm  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah   and who said that he wouldn't, he wouldn't mind\n<$A> Jennie said she  well she wasn't saying   that you know to make trouble, she just thought he wouldn't, \n<$B>  Yeah yeah Oh wouldn't she just thought I   would 've thought, I would 've thought   he would 've been concerned \n<$A>  Yeah it 's   a different kind of scene to the   the drink you know And I don't think he \n<$B>  Yeah yeah, it is really, Yeah   I mean it 's too dangerous when you look at the likes of Bobby Nelson\n<$A> It is It is   Oh it 's absolutely frightening absolutely \n<$B>  <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> life You know   and it 's starting he started on cough bottles kind of   you know \n<$A>  Yeah   at fourteen it 's just   not on Not on,  So anyway but he was like a devil yesterday Then he announced yesterday he said I 'm going into town to get my ear pierced And I said you are in your bum going into town to get your ear pierced Where are you going And he said oh this place in Nemo 's Arcade And I said you have to go somewhere hygienic or you 'll get AIDS or something,   And Ben \n<$B>  Too young yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Mm, would   he not be afraid of that\n<$A> And Ben said something and he , and he turned round and said I wasn't speaking to   you,  in this tone And I said get up that stairs to your room I really wanted to thump him   really viciously  I wasn't speaking to   you,  So I said get up that stairs So after a while he called Ben out and said I 'm sorry It 's just blah blah blah So anyway   I said \n<$B>  Oh Lord  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Well at   least he did that\n<$A> Yeah anyway I said uhm, but it 's kind of getting to the point where I 'll say that and he 's going to say no   and then you 'll think what the hell do you do then,  I mean he 's really getting quite aggressive you know   quite nasty, at times you know And kind of, I 'm bigger than you and this kind of thing,  So anyway I, then he wanted to talk to me so I came out to the bottom of the stairs and he said he was sorry and all that And I said look I 've no objection to you getting your ear pierced but, you know you have to be careful and that   So in  the end anyway he went into this place and he got it done So I thought thought I hope it 's as sore as   bedamned you little  shite  I hope   it 's real sore \n<$B>  Yeah, yeah what do you do then yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  Mm mm  \n<$B>  And   just one is it\n<$A> Oh just one Oh yes of course and the left If it 's the right one you 're gay\n<$B> Oh I see\n<$A> And boy would he not like to be   taken for a gay \n<$B>  Oh I thought   it was only uh that it didn't matter which one If it was one you were gay\n<$A> No no the right   one is gay \n<$B>  I see   I see\n<$A> But real aggressive Then this morning he and then he starts saying to me uhm will you give me the bus fare tomorrow to go into town Now he had thirty-five pounds and he had coughed up five on the dope And I thought I 'd like my frigging job   sweetie giving you your twenty-five  p And I said no you can use your own money   And then he marched into \n<$B>  Yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah that was for   today was   it Oh \n<$A>  Yeah then he   marched into me today saying can I have my pocket money Like he gets, I think, I forget now I think it 's two pounds   I 'm   I 'm all mixed up with Christmas, And I said no, you 've enough money  , I  really thought you know the cheek   I mean I 'm hardly going to finance anything else , But uhm, he just  got up this morning and he 's permanently wants to have baths Now when you turn on the water for a bath the radiators have to go off and everyone is fucking freezing  , I  mean you you kind of have to pick your   time,  And I said no I said no you can't have one It 's too cold No it isn't cold It 's not a bit cold,    \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  Mm it is bloody freezing   I was just reading in the paper they 're saying there 's snow coming\n<$A> I 've kind of believe it, it just   feels like that tonight  Even though the sky is very clear   it just has that really cold feeling \n<$B>  Yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah does really   Bitter\n<$A> But anyway he was just the face of him now would just stop a clock you   know cos he can't have his bath  Like he 's in there every, at least every second day  , you know, Oh anyway \n<$B>  Yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah yeah, It 's   a bit much alright\n<$A> It is a bit much And and   I  certainly would worry about you know, he 's bad enough as he is and he 's going into a phase that will be so difficult with him going out and   that kind of thing I dread it you know  I really dread it  , kind of going  out and vanishing and,   hanging  round in gangs and this kind of thing It, he was kind of slow to do it but it has happened   now very, very abruptly you know Yeah \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  I know I know I know  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  I know yeah   suddenly yeah yeah If he was only kind of really into the study   or that \n<$A>  Oh   not a hope I mean to   kind of hang onto him to do the,  He is To hang onto him to do the Junior Cert and then kind of, at least til he gets over that reasonably you know It would be some job you know\n<$B>  Yeah He is bright  \n<$B> Yeah yeah or he might even go on to the Leaving Cert\n<$A> Oh he 's certainly, I mean go on to do it   Sure he 'll only be fifteen in July when he 'll certainly , but just kind of, even if he kind of went off the rails a bit then and got back, before the Leaving like   There 's after the Junior Cert there 's this uhm , transition year where   they, just kind of do enjoyable things \n<$B>  Mm oh right yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah   yeah they can go into jobs   and that and get experience \n<$A>  Yeah yeah   but uhm,  it 's just a whole phase   I 'm not looking forward to you know I really dread it, you know \n<$B>  I know I know I know Yeah yeah   and probably boys are that bit much more   difficult \n<$A>  Yeah   yeah and more aggressive you   know very aggressive now,  You know,\n<$B>  Yeah yeah yeah yeah  \n<$B> God doesn't seem any  length since he was a small child sitting on my knee\n<$A> I know I know   God  he wouldn't sit on it now I 'll tell you  Look crooked at him he 'd accuse you of being a perv \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Oh Lord\n<$A> So, it 's the worst really, the worst phase from   when  they kind of start that til when they 're about   eighteen you know \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah   yeah until you kind of feel   they have to be a bit responsible for themselves \n<$A>  You kind of feel   yeah that really there isn't much more you can   do after that you know But it 's really \n<$B>  Yeah yeah   but at least he 's staying there tonight now Is he\n<$A> Yeah yeah   He is here \n<$B>  Mm, does   he want to go to the disco again\n<$A> Uh no no he 's said he said he wanted to stay there tonight which I  uh stay here   tonight  He 's just gone up to Mike now for a while   but,  I was pleased with that you   know  He went last weekend so  , I  mean that 'll be it really maybe, maybe once or twice more now before the exam you know\n<$B>  Mm mm  \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B> Yeah yeah, And how 's Sharon\n<$A> Grand grand I mean at a, a much easier,   phase you know \n<$B>  Mm mm   She 'd probably be easier anyway\n<$A> I 'd say she would yeah   I 'd say she would I mean \n<$B>  Yeah,   She 'd be more into the books and that\n<$A> She would yeah   I 'd  say I mean you never know kind of   They all have their moods and that \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  No you don't   I suppose yeah\n<$A> But no I mean he 's always been sort of difficult  , and  cheeky and that But this kind of, look now that really makes you just boil    with rage you know , Really kind of trying it out you   know  And I know the day is going to come when I 'm going to say you know, do something or go upstairs or do you know   and he 's going to say  no And then what do you do And   that  you kind of avoid that because once he realises he can say no and get away with it you 've had it,   you know \n<$B>  Yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  And he 's gonna say no  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah   What do you do   really \n<$A>  What do   you do   You know \n<$B>  Yeah   <&> ingressive airstream <&> yeah  yeah,\n<$A> So , and I mean uh you see with the others too the whole dope thing is so acceptable He has seen so much of this you   know, that  kind of it 's, it 's so much part of life And Ben was saying he just does not want Sharon getting that  , picture you know just, Yeah yeah  he just doesn't want her to kind of view this as sort of   something \n<$B>  Yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah I can understand that totally yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah as   norm\n<$A> Yeah yeah, I agree completely I   mean I  had no control really over the others   and,  I think luckily that Mike has kind of changed his tune to some extent\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah  \n<$B> He seems to have   How is he \n<$A>  Yeah but he  , seems to be fine\n<$B> Does he   yeah I rang uhm , the Frankie O'Dea 's boyfriend I think a second night I don't think I was telling you, and he said she was going to have her sinuses cleared out\n<$A>  Seems to be grand yeah  \n<$A> Oh right,\n<$B> Which is a fairly big thing I   think  and it can be very painful\n<$A>  Ugh  \n<$A> Sounds horrible   yeah \n<$B>  Yeah  , I I remember actually when I was in the hospital a woman in the next bed having it and she looked absolutely wretched   I was thinking  I didn't say that to him\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> But I 'm sure it 'll   be good when it 's done \n<$B>  But it probably will   help yeah, So she must be still in or I imagine she 'd have given a call you know   that, So  it might be the beginning of a a kind of a, a change for   her you know \n<$A>  Yeah yeah  \n<$A>  It might   Yeah yeah,\n<$B> So I don't think there 's any other news really no  As I said I 'm eating too much My waistline has gone completely    I 'm just a lump \n<$A>  Who cares    Who cares anymore I don't give a  shite\n<$B> Well I don't like to be baggy kind of   you know,  Not for the sake of appearance but I feel   uncomfortable \n<$A>  I, no but  \n<$A>  Well yeah   when it gets to where   it doesn't feel, right \n<$B>  When   skirts feel tight and that   You feel well  maybe now for the New Year, I mean that Unislim did marvels for me   you know The discipline of it \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah yeah, And also   I mean in the cold everybody eats more   You have to \n<$B>  Well they do   And we 're going out,  Arthur 's great for kind of saying we 'll go for a walk Cos if it was left to me I 'd stew here I have six videos from Glen   of some oldies  you know\n<$A>  Yeah yeah", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

stuffed peppers with   uh,  mushrooms and onions and and chorizo sausages  , with chilli sauce , It was just too much though It was lovely   but, just ate so much like \n<$B>  Very good  \n<$B>  Very good My God  \n<$B>  Aye but well I haven't eaten   yet I 'm hungry now but I want something I don't know what I want Do you know   I don't want \n<$A>  Pizza   Pizza 's always good when you don't know what you want\n<$B> Naw I 'm not, I have to be really in the mood for pizza\n<$A> Really\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> That 's the one food that I don't have to be in the mood   for \n<$B>  Naw   meat I don't have to be in the mood for meat I could eat it three times a day\n<$A> I know So could   I,  In fact I can't actually have a meal without meat   being present \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah well I   meat and, uh only chicken as a substitute Nothing else\n<$A> I know\n<$B> Couldn't have anything else\n<$A> You 're not into your vegetables   either are you \n<$A>  No   fuck No way  I 'm eating rabbit food every day at work but there has to be a bit of meat for me to digest the, lettuce, carrots, and a bit of pasta that I take like\n<$A> Exactly\n<$B> It 's fucking killing   me <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> dinners \n<$A>  And the weather 's so depressing  , I   just hate  it feels like winter now   doesn't it \n<$B>  I know God I  \n<$B>  Well I   would prefer if it was fucking freezing than that wet that 's out there   tonight and that  Cos it 's not even well it was a wee bit chilly this evening there getting a bit chilly   but,  do you know the way it was pissing down, what day was it, Wednesday down at home I think it was or Tuesday   and  it would 've fucking boiled you alive   outside you know  You know warm It 's shit like\n<$A>  I know  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  I know I know  \n<$A> Well come here I texted you during the week there,\n<$B> Yes, aye, what was that about\n<$A> Uhm just to see whether you were busy over Halloween but I 'm sure you probably are\n<$B> Uhm I 'm not actually because Oh well that week you mean\n<$A> I 'm not even sure exactly when I 'll need somebody from\n<$B> Right\n<$A> But uhm I would need an extra pair of hands   Now because , uh you was quite ambiguous whether you 'd be able to work or not  , uhm , I phoned Linda to see if she could get   anybody  So she 's asking a few people this   evening as well \n<$B>  Right well  \n<$B>  Aye  \n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  That 's   fine sure\n<$A> But uhm if you were in Belfast I know how you like a wee bit   of extra work Will you be up here \n<$B>  Aye well I 'll tell you what   the thing is right I am actually uhm, I am actually, what am I doing I 'm changing wards You know that\n<$A> Aye you said that   in your text yeah \n<$B>  Yeah so ahm  , Jesus I 've got a cramp in my foot Fuck me Ahm I 'm changing wards so I should have an extra bit of cash coming in   anyway,  But the thing is I  I 'm be I will be working, uhm different shifts now Before I used to do four and a half days a week   half day on Friday  I 'm off the weekend Next week I work a Sunday But after that that might be changed I might have to work  long-day Saturdays and   Sundays so \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  That 's right yes  \n<$A>  And will   you be doing night duty now   as well \n<$B>  Well   I will be doing nights but I I don't know if I 'll be doing them for the first two weeks but   like I want them I  need the money like   so I mean for \n<$A>  You like doing nights though don't you  \n<$A>  And you   like doing them as well\n<$B> Yeah I don't mind them So I mean if it 's a case that I am off, say the Monday Tuesday of that week I 'd want to come up and help you   like,  Cos I mean I 'd be coming up to Seanie anyway seeing as I have to work the weekend   you know So come here listen  I 'm getting Friday, Friday the first of November  the night day after Halloween night off\n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Exactly So what I 'll do is  \n<$A> Oh are you\n<$B> Yeah well I 'm supposed to be going uhm Bob 's supposed to be deejaying on the boat in Derry\n<$A> That 's right yeah That 'd   be brilliant \n<$B>  So I think   we 're going into that myself and Seanie like <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Cos I I wouldn't mind going down However the shop won't be closed I 'd say until about   seven,  And that 's a bit too late really to go to Derry   Isn't it \n<$B>  I know  \n<$B>  Well ah  , maybe yeah Well it depends,   Angela \n<$A>  It 'd   more than likely be an all-night affair   But  then I have to be back in Belfast for ten in the morning\n<$B>  Ah  \n<$B> Right Well I 'm off the next day you see   Then I 'd probably end up  working that Saturday and Sunday maybe or Saturday anyway   So , I might be off the the two days at the start of the week If I am off anyway any of those couple of days I 'll come up and help you surely\n<$A>  So it just doesn't make sense  \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A> Right well  I 'll certainly keep you posted   on the whole thing \n<$B>  Aye

that, And she 's in the office doing admin work, but I think there 's the possibility, you know that she 'll she 'll get uhm, what do you call it uh promotion  , and  maybe get into her design and stuff like that\n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  Right  \n<$B> Ah excellent Very good   Tell her <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Which is good to see   cos like she 's looking a bit unhappy last   week,  She 's coming in to see me and it 's it 's really it 's money You see when you have money worries\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Oh it 's the   worst thing \n<$A>  There is absolutely   nothing more depressing\n<$B> Nothing And nothing can bring you round   Nothing  only money \n<$A>  Oh nothing because you  \n<$A> You  you can't actually do anything\n<$B> I know   I know \n<$A>  You know   you 're so stuck in a rut   and,  the bills coming in   and it 's even worse \n<$B>  And it 's  \n<$B>  Yeah exactly   It 's not, you can't even go to the shop   and get  yourself something cos you don't have it like\n<$A>  I know  \n<$A> I know exactly\n<$B> I know   <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  But I   can't wait til after Halloween Hopefully I 'm going to make my fortune\n<$B> Exactly

wouldn't be selling them really\n<$B> Could you text Martin and ask him to get one\n<$A> Uhm I don't even have Martin 's number now And apparently he 's turned off his phone because people keep ringing him,\n<$B> Or get like one of those guys to get him in on the night You know what I mean\n<$A> I don't think they could do that  need tickets,\n<$B> I 'd say like if you knew one of the guys

just a bit torn between the other one\n<$B> Well how about you say to Sarah you were invited to this one first\n<$A> Well we could but then we were thinking she might think it was a bit bad We 'd be friendlier with her, You know what I   mean \n<$B>  Does   she know that,\n<$A> Well yeah, Well she 'd know we weren't that friendly with just a random guy Uhm\n<$B> Damn, and where 's hers on\n<$A>

{"text": "<College plans>\n\n\n<$A> My plan is to become popular by uhm being really good at cooking and making them all dependent on me, kind of like a drug dealer, and then they 'll need me so I 'll be friends with them \n<$B> Like a drug dealer\n<$A> Only with food,\n<$B> Judith is there something you want to tell us\n<$A> Yeah I I I 'm a food dealer \n<$B> Yeah you look like the type alright Those eyes are always quite shifty\n<$A> Yeah, with a hungry look\n<$B>  Oh God, I mean I know I 'm sure you, you can't wait Like what, what 's the accommodation there like Is it nice or is it\n<$A> Uh it 's fairly good, it 's better than a lot of places Uhm you 'd share, everybody has their own room and you have the room for three years which most places only give it to you for one or two years\n<$B> You pay every year then\n<$A> Yeah And you only have to pay rent for the weeks of term which is loads better than getting a flat, because for that you 'd have to pay for the whole   year,  And I think you share a kitchen with three other people, which is the least anywhere else would have you Like in Reading you 'd share with between three and eleven people\n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B> Okay well most places, I remember places where I went to over in Liverpool I remember it was, you shared as well but there was maximum of six I think\n<$A> Right It 's not bad but uhm anyway like three is pretty good so\n<$B> Yeah no three is actually brilliant\n<$A> Yeah, Uh so it 's, like they, you sort of have like a bedroom and it 's okay and there 's a room, like a sort of a bigger dining room where you can have people over and stuff so\n<$B> Oh cool\n<$A> It looks pretty good and you can kind of, it 's handy like you can choose between cooking for yourself and going down to the canteen and in a lot of other places you have to decide at the start of term which you want to do and you 're stuck with that for the rest of the term\n<$B> Oh right\n<$A> But like you can, you have both options there anyway so, I just have to keep reminding myself of that  One of my study incentives\n<$B> And then is it like, are all the rooms ensuite or do youse all share a bathroom as well\n<$A> Uhm, some of them are ensuite You kind of apply for it and it 's kind of first come first served so,   fingers crossed  for me\n<$B>  Fingers crossed  \n<$B> Yeah so, so hopefully just the three people are alright and they 're not,\n<$A> Exactly\n<$B> Cos then like with eleven people you 'd be assured to have a few good people there but three people you 're just\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Fingers crossed  Nice people\n<$A> Hopefully Hopefully Oh well that 's if I get in at all I mean,\n<$B> Ah you did I 'm sure\n<$A> You didn't sit my exams\n<$B> But you 're Judith You 're smart\n<$A> Yeah but it was hard\n<$B> I 'm sure it was but, it 's always you come out thinking I did crap but, you actually did okay\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> And you need what, you need one A and four Bs\n<$A> Two As\n<$B> Two As and four Bs\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Let 's see and do they, do the As have to be in like honours subjects\n<$A> Yes They have to be in history and geography\n<$B> History and geography Right They have to have to be in, right That 's a bit pissy that it has to be history and geography\n<$A> It is a bit pissy really\n<$B> Can it not just be any subject or\n<$A> Nope I mean occasionally they 'll kind of make allowances for you You 're not meant to know it but, they do sometimes like if you got, like I was talking to some girl at an open day there who, like she was a student there and she was over from Ireland And like they wanted As in like, biology and chemistry and maths or something, and she got like the As in biology and chemistry and a B in maths and an A in something else so she, they let her in anyway\n<$B> Yeah Sure you never know Maybe they might\n<$A> Yeah Hopefully Oh well I 'll just appeal everything I don't like\n<$B> But sure for all you know you could could have got A in both of them But the worst thing is, imagine if you appealed and then the result came back worse\n<$A> That 's horrible but they only did did that to like eight people and they upgraded a few thousand I think so\n<$B> Ah right yeah\n<$A> I think it 's pretty unlikely to happen\n<$B> No, cos that 's the one thing I 'd fear about contesting a result I 'd just be like, and they 'd go back over it with a, even more so, cos   like  realistically they correct the stuff in the space of like, what, five minutes or something like that\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yeah But I mean I think they say they go back over it when you appeal it looking for  extra marks they can give you, not looking for\n\n<$A> Okay That was easy to fix\n<$B> What was it\n<$A> He just moved it\n<$B> Oh right , So do I not, did I not get any hold music no\n<$A> Uhm no you 're not on hold\n<$B> You could put me on hold\n<$A> No, I just yelled over my shoulder at my dad That doesn't count as putting you on hold\n<$B> Fine\n<$A> Oh Have you ever heard the Specsavers ' hold music\n<$B> No\n<$A> It 's like clown music It 's awful And then if you ask to be put up to the contact lens department they put you on hold again And it 's the same clown music only faster and more high-pitched  And every few seconds it 's interrupted by,  welcome to Specsavers Your call is important to us \n<$B> That 's just scary\n<$A> It 's really horrible\n<$B> I 'm so glad I use Vision Express\n<$A> Yeah I know It seems to have paid off as well considering how well you can see a pool table\n<$B> Yeah It 's great \n<$A> Pool hustler\n<$B> No but No but although I 've never had to ring them, so for all I know they could have weird hold music as well\n<$A> Yeah they might And in my mam 's old work it was really bad It was like a computer-generated version of Greensleeves and it was really slow and depressing and horrible\n<$B> Oh God\n<$A> It was really bad\n<$B> Yeah, no that would be alright\n<$A> Basically there is no good hold music\n<$B> No Except for the lift music That 's pretty near\n<$A> The what music\n<$B> Lift music\n<$A> Where\n<$B> In lifts\n<$A> Not all lifts Actually I don't think I 've ever been in a lift that had lift music\n<$B> One thing I hate though, talking lifts I hate them\n<$A> Rory, where do you get in lifts I 've never come across any of these things\n<$B> Have you never heard, seen those talking lifts where it 's, ground floor, first floor\n<$A> No Oh well in airports\n<$B> Yeah Between the, those kind of yokes\n<$A> Welcome to departures\n<$B> Uhm, what do you call, and where else did, was I in one I think Arnott 's might have them\n<$A> Really\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Why don't you go up the stairs, you lazy git\n<$B> Ah no like we were, I can't remember why we were going up the lift but we went up the lift I was, I think it 's cos we were going up to the second floor and we were down in the basement and we were just walking by the lifts anyway so it was just like,\n<$A> Isn't that for people in wheelchairs\n<$B> Well uh, them and the lazy\n<$A>  Them and the lazy\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Fair enough\n<$B> No so, but what were we talking about there\n<$A> I 've no idea We were gibbering\n<$B> Yeah no we kind of got sidetracked there and there 's, there 's something I was going to say I can't remember now, Uhm, no it 's gone\n<$A> Aw\n<$B> I know It probably wasn't that interesting anyway\n<$A> That 's possible\n<$B> Yeah, well you never know , if I remember it\n<$A> We were talking about the exams\n<$B> Yeah no, it wasn't something about, I think it was something about lifts but I can't think of it, what it was now\n<$A> Oh well\n<$B> Oh yeah, now I remember No see once when I was in a lift with my brother, we were in James 's hospital right\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> And while the lift was going down he opened the doors\n<$A> What a bastard What the hell did he do that for\n<$B> He was just like, ah, Rory, I was in here like cos he was in the lift by himself earlier and he did that like, and he was just like, oh look at this, this is so cool\n<$A> Ah That 's like something my brother would do\n<$B>  And it was just like, then the thing, the lift stopped and it was just like, oh no we 're stuck, we 're stuck Oh my God And it was just like  and he was just there oh Jesus I can't even close them, I was just like, Michael\n<$A> What an idiot\n<$B> But he was only pretending he closed the doors, so Then the thing started going again and it was just like, you fucking bastard\n<$A>  Ugh That 's horrible\n<$B> I know cos, like I usually I don't mind small confined spaces but if I was going to be stuck there it would be pretty crazy\n<$A> Yeah That would really be horrible Have you seen that ad you know where they get stuck in the lift and they start drinking coffee I mean wouldn't that be the worst thing you could do when you were stuck in a lift, like drinking something that was going to make you need to pee really soon\n<$B> Yeah I know  Yeah I know that would be quite a stupid idea really, Oh, so, I 'll never forget that day It was just like , but\n<$A> It 's really horrible\n<$B> It really is And you wonder why I 'm the bitter middle child\n<$A> Yeah I 've suddenly realised why you 're so bitter I mean it couldn't have been because of his laziness because you 're just as lazy So I didn't know what it was Or just the fact that everyone calls you Little Rasho\n<$B> That that that also annoys me actually yeah\n<$A> So when your sister gets there they 're just going to call her Female Rasho \n<$B> Female Rasho\n<$A> Just like you only wearing Escape for women instead\n<$B> Yeah, Is that, is that nice is that nice all that stuff or would you know\n<$A> What Escape for women\n<$B> Mm\n<$A> It 's kind of old-womany It 's not that nice\n<$B> Yeah That wouldn't be nice at all really Or how about Emporio for women Is that nice\n<$A> Hang on no, yeah I haven't smelled Escape for women, I 've smelled Emporio for women and it 's not very nice\n<$B> God you women really don't, maybe the, maybe it 's the ones where they like do a man and women version\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> The men 's version 's always nicer\n<$A> I don't know Ah well, we have nice smells in Boots\n<$B> Exactly\n<$A> Ginger and lime, nothing can beat it\n<$B> Uh no so, what was it but, <unclear> several sylls </unclear> I can't remember what it was now I really have the memory of\n<$A> You keep doing that\n<$B> I really have the memory of a goldfish you know I\n<$A> I think the exams have done something to you\n<$B> Yeah they 've just  ruined my mind forever School 's over Don't need that any more\n<$A> School 's over and it 's destroyed you Ah so much fun throwing out notes I just went into a note-cleaning frenzy the other day, threw out everything in about half an hour\n<$B> Oh I know it 's great", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fd1d271e-b679-4fc8-841a-a6d1bb8b44d6", "added":

{"text": "<Sociolinguistics 1>\n\n\n<$A> So fieldwork then Uhm we want to start with fieldwork Will somebody hand me a copy of the fieldwork exercise so that I 've one in front of me and you can fire away at questions and I 'll say some general words Now I 'm not going to tell people how exactly to do it but I 'm very willing to take general questions because I know it 's the sort of thing you haven't probably tried to do before Uhm one of the points about this is that it doesn't say uh do this in exactly this precise way and that 's very deliberate because there are many different answers to how you might achieve the tasks that are set you And the way to work out how to achieve them is uh, from a mix of things First and foremost of course from what you 've read in the literature about how other people uh set about recording naturalistic speech Uh and secondly of course from uh trial and error And don't be surprised if you actually have a go at one of these exercises for the first time and you come home and it 's all wrong, or you 're at home and it 's all wrong and you can't hear the voice, uh it doesn't actually demonstrate what you 've set out to demonstrate People often have two goes at it to get it right Uhm, or sometimes even if you 've a trial go in the right kind of context with uh a fake situation then at least you can uh judge things like recording level and how well they 're working So, you know, don't expect to get it right first time And of course the final point is, don't expect to think that there is a right answer There isn't a right answer Okay There is no right way of doing it Uhm, and it 's up to you what way you choose to do it Uh people often want there to be a finite definite right way There isn't Uh and there 's a lot of choice that you can use within that The main thing is it 's naturalistic It mustn't be faked, it mustn't be acted, it mustn't be off TV, it mustn't be off radio Uhm and believe me if it 's any of those things I 'll detect it immediately Very easy to detect anything that is acted We 've had a couple of occasions in the past where it has been done like that Uh so you want to get something that is as naturalistic as possible and then you want to carry out the few very simple linguistic tasks that you 're asked to execute, like naming a few phonological or other variables and saying something about them So over to you Any questions or   any thoughts about that \n<$B>  Is it okay if you   tape your friends\n<$A> No problem with that Alistair I mean if you think about that in the context of sociolinguistic literature, it would be a good method, or should be a good method to use because uh you know if you use uh a network that you 're part of you are more likely to be less intimidating to them and to get better speech More naturalistic speech\n<$B> Or should we be aiming to get uhm Belfast speakers\n<$A> That depends on which of the tasks you do because uhm one of the tasks is uh people from different social backgrounds Okay One of the tasks is style shifting, and one of the tasks is regional backgrounds Uh so for instance if you choose uh if you want to get three speakers uh of different regional backgrounds, uh you might uh want to choose Belfast, Derry and somewhere else Uhm so the the the place is relevant to the question Uhm if you want, you know if you 're a non-native, did you get it Eleanor\n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> Oh good Uh I 've got your essay here by the way There you are It was on a disc Do you want to come and get it Uhm if you 're non-native and you want to do that exercise, I know some of you will probably ask me, uh the the way that you define region can be different Uh you know you might define region in a broader kind of way than say Belfast, Derry and Dublin or something You might define region as uhm Irish English, English English, Scottish English, American English, uhm and you know you 're bound to meet people uh in wherever you 're living wherever you are that probably reflect different regions like that and that as a non-native listener you can probably at least start to think about some of the analysis of the differences rather than some that a native listener is more likely to pick up perceptually Does that make sense\n<$D>  Do they have to be uhm native speakers \n<$A> Uhm, yes It 's actually quite hard, I mean it 's quite hard to conceive of this exercise, the way it 's written, uh dealing with non-native speakers and I think I have put in the word native speaker of English in each case deliberately\n<$D>  Yeah yeah \n<$A> We you do have to have that So that for instance uh if you 're going away for Christmas or whatever you 're going to have to think about probably doing your fieldwork before you go aren't you That 's one of the problems that SOCRATES students often face or, you know students from abroad They need to think about this before Well you all actually ought to be thinking about it before Christmas anyway quite frankly cos you don't want to end up in a situation in early January where you 've done neither the essay nor the fieldwork assignment and then have to do them both together And my recommendation is to get the fieldwork one out of the way first and then think about the essay\n<$E>  Can your voice be on the tape \n<$A> Yeah if you 're, depends what role you 're playing   uhm in a way \n<$E>   It 's just cos   you can't get someone to talk solidly for thirty minutes without talking back to them really \n<$A> Oh no I mean well that that wouldn't be, you know if you think about that and a fieldworker a good fieldworker wouldn't do that, uhm because most people don't talk solidly for thirty minutes unless they 're doing something like a performance a lecture or something Uhm and uh yes I mean by all means you talk to them but you 'll then be part of uh the the social setting in which you 're carrying out the experiment so you would expect your methodology to incorporate some discussion of why you 're there\n<$F> What about tape recorders and that\n<$A> Yes well practical things Uhm I mean obviously it 's easier from my point of view if as many of you as possible use whatever you might have yourselves Uhm but if people are stuck and really need help then I will undertake to try to supply you with tape recorders Now of course you need to find out what kind of a recording you can get with a tape recorder of whatever size and whether you need a mike or whether you don't need a mike Uhm uh that that kind of thing So you need, that 's why I 'm saying you need to almost have a dry run at this sort of thing as an  you know a a physical setting in which you try and set things up\n<$G> Is it okay to have your like two or three speakers speaking together, or or do they have to be all separate\n<$A> Well uhm, uh one of the, two of the exercises talk about three native speakers Okay Uhm so my understanding of that in a natural setting is probably, you could do it different ways, uhm uh I mean you could interpret it as meaning you take three separate people and uh you, you or somebody else talks to each of them separately uhm and you then compare them at the end That 's one way to do it Another way to do it is uh you could have them all together Uh if you then put them all together of course you 'd have to have some  social justification for putting them all together and you 've got just three total strangers dumped together in a room Sociolinguistically it 's unlikely to work So that 's really up to you Elaine what you actually do with that Uhm now talking together of course if you 've three people in a room talking and if it 's reasonably natural you 'll get a  lot of overlap and so on but that 's natural that shows that you 've got good conversation So  it 's entirely up to you how you handle that\n<$F> Is that three native speakers like excluding you You can't be one of the native speakers\n<$A> Uhm   it doesn't say it doesn't say you can't  be one of the native speakers\n<$F>  I mean say you, say  \n<$F> I mean say you just set the tape recorder down and talked to two people\n<$A> That would give you three   Yes  But you would have to have a justification for how you fit in the set-up because you would have to uhm fit either a different regional background from the other two or a different social background from the other two So as long as it answers what you 're asked to do then there is no law against you doing those sorts of things And indeed there might be some kind of social justification for doing it\n<$F>  Yes  \n<$H> Can you use any age group\n<$A> Aoife Uhm\n<$H> I mean can you use like a teenager like\n<$A> Well, yes there is nothing to stop you using whatever age group you want Uhm of course uhm in this kind of study uh you 're never going to prove anything conclusively about social backgrounds or regional backgrounds because you 're only dealing with three people maximum So if you for example have a teenager uhm uh working-class background uhm and uhm you know a thirty year old uhm middle-class background and a sixty year old uh upper middle-class background, you 're going to be dealing with a number of different variables at the same time which sort of makes it harder for you to say anything sensible socially about those, the differences between those accents  do you understand me But I mean but you you 're never going to answer that easily anyway with three people\n<$H?> I 'm finding it very hard to get three different people from three different social backgrounds Can you use like uhm a student somebody from a working-class background Uhm can you use students at all\n<$A> You can course you can use students\n<$H?> Put that in as being a different background   Because I can't \n<$A>  Well but then   it 's up to you to justify how you feel you have or how you have measured somebody 's social background\n\n<$A> Uhm they have more German uhm and uh they have more German uh also across more ranges of people that they 're speaking to uh so that they are now even speaking to close relatives like their dad in German The younger women are speaking to their fathers in German uh so German is  steadily taking over Note of course that they all, now this is quite interesting, that everybody no matter what age group speaks to God in in Hungarian Now how they worked, I don't know the actual uh how they got them, I think they just asked them what form they used to to God or to people and they all said they they spoke Hungarian to God which is, how do, I mean why do you think that would be the case actually I think it would seem to be outside, sorry Eleanor\n<$C> The older ones probably teach the younger ones their prayers and then   teach them  <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear>\n<$A>  It just gets   passed on perhaps\n<$?> Yeah\n<$A> I was wondering if it was some kind of you know relationship thing or intimacy or, I don't know\n<$C> Maybe it 's because it 's a personal thing and you just uhm the most natural and easiest language, you would\n<$A> With something terribly personal\n<$C> Yeah   It 's terribly personal \n<$A>  Right Well that 's just yeah yeah   Or it could be a mix of the two I mean it may just be a sort of habit as as Eleanor 's kind of saying and something like that would stick But I mean the main point is there, that in bilingual communities the pressure uh of peer groups among younger people here uh starts at an early age with young women and has actually succeeded by the looks of it in actual shifting uh the whole uhm stability of the bilingual position uh state state in this community Uhm so uh does any of this make any sense to you Wilhelm\n<$I>  No I was just wondering because I think that it 's clear that fourteen year old women don't have husbands but seventy year old women are talking to their grandparents Which language do they use \n\n<$A> Hang on Wait a minute Women of seventy are talking to their grandparents You see that is a bit odd isn't it\n\n<$A> No but no but hang on But this is not empirical work That 's why I said that the women that they were asked what language they would use rather than observing grandparents talking to grandparents which as you quite correctly point out would be a bit peculiar So it 's just that they 're asking them And of course that 's relying on their memory then again, what language did I talk to my grandparents in", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5d66e5fb-63ae-4b85-b36d-09aef5b551f8", "added":

{"text": "<English supervision>\n\n\n<$A> That 's most of one chapter That 's the chapter on identity I haven't   got  the Higgins onto it\n<$B>  Okay  \n<$A> Onto it because uhm I haven't finished reading Scenes from a Receding Past I 've sort of just done about Elizabeth Bowen <unclear> several sylls </unclear> there 's no actual introduction into that\n<$B> Where, where 's this going to fit then\n<$A> Well that 's, I think going to be the first chapter and then I 'm going to have\n<$B> After an introduction\n<$A> Yes And then I 'm going to have the gender chapter next\n<$B> Right so this is   identity  identity\n<$A>  Following on from that  \n<$A> That 's all basically just uhm Irish Ascendancy  identity\n<$B> This one\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Yeah Scribble here\n<$A> So hopefully I 'll get the Higgins uhm left in for you some time next week\n<$B> Okay uhm, right Okay Uhm well obviously then I 'd need to\n<$A> Read over again\n<$B> Aha, have a look through this Uh and how 's it going generally Just in terms of   work you 've already done, and so on \n<$A>  Well uhm   I 've got most of the background work that I want to do now and I 'm trying just to really centre on the texts themselves rather than\n<$B> Right\n<$A> Put in too much literary criticism You know, which we did last week Get it down onto the text and actually what 's in the book\n<$B> Uh-huh\n<$A> Rather than what other people have said about it, so I 've done I think enough background, unless you think I should do some more   uhm  criticisms Uhm it 's going not too bad except I 'm working full-time now, so it 's a bit uhm\n<$B>  Right  \n<$B> What are you up to\n<$A> Well I 'm working full-time in Dillon 's now, again\n<$B> Where\n<$A> In Dillon 's\n<$B> Oh right so you 're back there\n<$A> Back there again for a year or so and uh, well until I have uhm decided what to do So it 's it 's a bit tough then trying to fit everything in but\n<$B> Mhm\n<$A> It will get done I 'm hoping to get the identity chapter done, or the sorry the gender chapter done, over the next couple of weeks\n<$B> Right, so\n<$A> Time 's moving in <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$B> Sorry say that last bit again\n<$A> Time 's moving on I should say  Uh you know it 's not going\n<$B> Mhm\n<$A> To start getting it written\n<$B> Right so, the setup now is that you 've got the, there 'll be an introduction, there 's this and a draft of the first chapter\n<$A> Mhm Yeah\n<$B> But you said the, was it\n<$A> The Higgins isn't  , attached  on to that there I didn't do the Higgins yet I 've got uhm, I 've got, I read Killachter Meadow\n<$B>  You wanted to add more to this  \n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> As well so I want to include that\n<$B> Mhm\n<$A> But I 'd rather read, finish off Scenes from a Receding Past first\n<$B> Mhm Is that proving useful at all\n<$A> Yes, it is Yeah I 'm enjoying it actually  I 'm really really enjoying it It reminds me a lot of Banville, I see wee things in Books of Evidence and stuff, Book of Evidence and stuff\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Written at the time but it just reminds me of Banville 's language\n<$B> No I think I mean, well I think it 's a very under-rated novel and uh\n<$A> I think it 's much much better than Langrishe Go Down\n<$B> I wouldn't go that far, I prefer Langrishe but the uh   No, I really \n<$A>  I don't like the   fact that it 's only like Imogen 's story and Helen and   Lily  are obviously shoved to the side\n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> I think that 's a failing in it But\n<$B> Mm\n<$A> They 're very different But it certainly is is proving useful\n<$B> Yeah, good\n<$A> It 'll be particularly useful for the gender chapter I think\n<$B> Mm\n<$A> More so than identity\n<$B> So, there 's the gender chapter, then then what else\n<$A> Then the  conclusion\n<$B> Right So that 's, that 's probably pretty much it Cos I I 'm just sort of looking at, thinking in terms of length   and  so on you 've got what   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A>  It 's probably about   four thousand words there I would say Near it\n<$B> Yeah that 's probably, it 's not, not too bad I mean if you 've got a bit more to add to this\n<$A> Mm, Yeah\n<$B> Then the chapters should be about five thousand each\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Uhm and everything then in terms of structure and so on it 's all working\n<$A> Yeah well hopefully Well you can read through that and see what you think of the structure I 've really just gone through uhm each book  , and  then tried to link up a bit more as I 've gone through them So I 've started with Bowen and then gone onto Keane So I 've tried to make a few references in the Keane section to the Bowen books to try and link it up a wee bit But if you think there 's anything wrong with the structure then you know, tell me\n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B> Okay And I mean you 've finalised, I mean you 're you 're, I mean apart from the Higgins which you 're still working on, you 've finalised the texts\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> So it 's Bowen, Keane, Higgins, Banville\n<$A> No I wasn't going to Because I 'm going, I 'm  to do, I 've done two uhm texts by Bowen and then two by Keane and then two by Higgins and then The Killachter Meadow as well\n<$B> Mhm Right now\n<$A> So that 's six nearly seven The short story was from <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Unless you think I should include more\n<$B> No I mean I I just uh, I just wasn't uh  uh, because I haven't seen\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Anything by you so far you know, I haven't really got a sense of which uh texts you you 're really working on and which ones you 're going to  focus on Uhm, right Well \n<$A> That 's basically it isn't it\n<$B> Well, I think pretty much Uh, what I 'll do is, I mean I 'll I 'll uh get through this I mean are you in and out through the week or are you\n<$A> Uhm well Tuesday 's my only day off so it 's really awkward now for getting up to Queen 's Uhm, but I mean I can certainly call up and collect that or get my mum to collect it at some stage\n<$B> Right Well I mean if it 's easier I can post it out to your home address\n<$A> Oh no Leave it in and I can collect it cos I think I 'll probably be in round about, round Queen 's on Tuesday anyway\n<$B> Right well I 'll\n<$A> I mean if it 's not ready on Tuesday, I mean don't worry about it\n<$B> No I 'll leave it, I 'll leave it in for Tuesday\n<$A> Right okay Uh hopefully I 'll have the Higgins up for sometime during the week, then get on to the gender chapter\n<$B> Right\n<$A> So I 'm going to work on that during the weekend\n<$B> Okay Uhm let 's see, uh, I 'm just trying, I 'm thinking about that because I 'm going to be away\n<$A> Right\n<$B> From about mid-August through to sometime in early September\n<$A> Right\n<$B> And even if I 'm not away I 'm just going to take off because I haven't had a holiday yet and I deserve it  So uh uhm that means that, let 's see, I have to go away <unclear> several sylls </unclear>, uh, I 'll be  I 'll be around sort of the week of the fifteenth <unclear> several sylls </unclear>, So I mean from now on a a Friday meeting would be difficult for you anyway\n<$A> Unless I can, I can come up after work but I don't know whether that would suit you or not\n<$B> Well,  I mean why not, why not make it Tuesday then if that 's your day off\n<$A> Right well it 's just uh whatever really suits you then\n<$B> Well actually the I mean the earlier, the earlier that things can be cleared up on the week of the fifteenth the better So that that 's the sixteenth of August then that Tuesday\n<$B> Right okay\n<$B> Okay and uhm, right and what I 'll say ten thirty\n<$A> Yeah that 's fine,\n<$B> And that I mean that would be the, that would be the gender chapter\n<$A> Yes that 's right\n<$B> I mean is that, you reckon you 'd be able to get it done by then\n<$A> Yeah I should I should be able to get it done by the second It might not be typed up but it will be written up in some form or another\n<$B> Okay Now I mean it 's just that that uhm, you know as I was saying I 'll be away from   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Yeah, no I would like you to see it before  , before that time\n<$B> Uh-huh No I mean I 'll be back in early September so I 'll be able to read things but I mean\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> My main aim is to  get people going so to speak and I 'll have a look at it\n<$A> Uhm in the introduction do you think I should have a background sort of to the Big House generally Would that be a good idea\n<$B> Well I mean explain some more to me about what you mean by what <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Uhm sort of uhm, the history Should I introduce the history though, or should I\n<$B> What, go right back to Edgeworth and\n<$A> Yeah And even just uhm the history of the political novel <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> social novel Or should I just stick to the Big House as a genre\n<$B> Well I mean I think your, your concern with this is really in terms of the way in which the Big House operates as a true figure\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> And the kinds of issues about both social identity and gender   identity  that it raises So, uh there are ways in which a political history or a social history of the Big House feed into that\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yes\n<$B> But I think they 're slightly removed   You know in other words I think \n<$A>  Yes, I wasn't sure whether I should,   do you know that it would maybe be a bit too much of a tangent maybe, the political, or whether it would be appropriate\n<$B> You see I think, I mean I think in in talking about this before I mean one of the points, I can't, trying to remember now, actually I was trying to remember as I was walking in this morning, whether it was, whether it was you or somebody else I had been making the point to which is that that one of the things which happens with the Big House, very often, and Aroon in Good Behaviour is the perfect instance of this, uh is that, and uh I mean the the Langrishes are another good instance, that uhm what you have is property ending up in the possession of unmarried women\n<$A> Yeah I was just thinking that\n<$B> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and  that point about uhm, how, that may not strictly speaking be historically accurate   I  mean it 's not the case that the Ascendancy died out because you know no male heirs   were produced  But what that does is actually in literary texts is to dramatise so to speak the end of the line   You know  because the whole point of something like the Big House is to do with property transfer, you know and inheritance\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yes yes  \n<$A>  Right  \n<$B> And the and the facts of uhm you know the laws of inheritance certainly in the early part of the century <unclear> several sylls </unclear> When when Big Houses end up with unmarried women\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> This is actually kind of metaphorically you know even literally, the end of the line\n<$A> Right\n<$B> Now, there 's a case in which, in order to, to in a sense dramatise that notion of a line of inheritance having come to a full stop, writers use women in that way and whether they mean to or not that necessarily provokes questions about gender identity\n<$A> Mhm, yes\n<$B> Does this mean that you know you can't be a proper Ascendancy figure if you 're a woman <unclear> 2 sylls

something that involves court <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Uhm, so if I I think there is a gap in other words between that kind of political legal   history  and the way in which it 's used in

{"text": "<Byzantium 1>\n\n\n<$A> Right because the thing is that there are two ways of trans-literary of getting out of the Greek into English And one of them it comes out as  and the other one is  And it actually means exactly the same thing Okay And what it actually means is brother-making or perhaps more exactly sibling, making Right Okay And, one of the features of the two traditions that Sean actually identifies is the fact that,  is mentioned in one tradition and not in the other Or rather, the  with\n<$B> Nicholas Nicholas I think   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Yeah   Nicholas   yeah \n<$B>  Nicholas yeah   The fact that there was actually a mention of <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>, went to the church and,   the  whole rejoice in the union\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yes Does that indicate it that there was\n<$A> Okay cos who are some of the right what 's actually the story Who are some of the who are the people that you hopefully have read about Right so okay we 've got, Michael the Third Who 's Michael the Third\n<$C> The   Emperor \n<$B>  The   Emperor\n<$A> The Emperor\n<$B> Can I ask you a quick question  before you go any further about Michael the Third When I read uhm, the <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> Tucker what it seemed to say that Michael the Third and Basil were of similar age\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> But when I, read the Boswell one   it  seemed to say that, Michael, was younger,   He was more  youthful   than Franzo \n<$A>  Mm hm  \n<$A>  Not  \n<$A>  Yes   He, right well I mean yes he is, slightly younger,   but I mean  but I mean   it 's a it 's it 's less than , sorry it 's less than five years\n<$B>  <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>  \n<$B>  Cos I thought maybe  \n<$B> Okay\n<$A> But the other big difference is that, Basil 's big and hunky,   whereas  Michael the Third isn't And so in actual fact he, Basil actually appears older Okay\n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> No no no that 's okay So right one of the people that we 've got is Michael the Third, okay who right one of the traditions in the Byzantine Empire is that they quite often give nicknames to their, emperors So like you have Constantine the Seventh Porphyrogenitus Uhm you also have Leo the Sixth The Wise, and you also have Michael the Third who 's known as The Sot, uhm cos apparently he was fond of a jar or two Okay so well I mean the other thing is that he 's also meant to have been fond of lots of other things   as well yeah \n<$B>  Other things   yeah \n<$A>  Hmm Meanwhile back at the ranch So okay we 've got, Basil the First, right well Basil What do you know about Basil What does the story say about Basil\n<$C> Said he came out with a stick and stuff\n<$A> Right, right one of the things was that he came with a with a stick and a little sort of knapsack or or you know like Dick Whittington with all his worldly goods tied up in a big hanky Okay\n<$B> Sort of rags to riches\n<$C>   Yeah \n<$A>  It 's   very much a rags to riches story\n<$B> I think he slept his way to the top \n<$?> Yeah\n<$C> I think he did too \n<$D> He didn't do very well did he\n<$A> Who else do we who else is involved in the story Right we 've we 've also heard of Nicholas, right Who 's Nicholas\n<$C> Is that the son of the, he 's the one they found on the church steps Was that   the monk \n<$D>  <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>  \n<$A> Right Nicholas   Nicholas  is the monk who may either be a doorkeeper or an abbot, depending on which story you you know which story you follow But in the monastery, on the outskirts of Constantinople but within the walls who discovers uhm Basil sleeping on the in the in the porch Okay, Who else is there\n<$B>  Monk yeah  \n<$E>  <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> something Basil as well but different \n<$B> Is that the new   Basil \n<$E>   Yeah is that the   Yes I think <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>, \n<$A> That 's in Lycos\n<$E>  Uh it 's in my head  \n<$D> He 's the young model isn't he\n<$A> Sorry\n<$D> He 's the younger model\n<$C>   Yeah <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Younger model Uhm   but he 's he 's the one, that Basil is frightened is, Michael the Third is going to replace him\n<$B> That 's why he was   like \n<$D>  The one   he paraded around in uh   <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  But there 's John Wasn't there a John   And uhm \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yes there 's     John  And who 's John\n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D> His mother, wanted to form, the spiritual, brotherhood   between  Basil and her son John\n<$A>  Uh  \n<$A> Yes Okay and the widow is called   Danelis , and Danelis is a rich, a rich widow Uhm just the thing for a young man looking to get ahead  uhm who has a son John And she, basically showers wealth and riches on, Basil the First well on Basil before he becomes Basil the First, So those are the, those are the main characters Uhm there are several other characters that probably ought to be mentioned\n<$D>    \n<$D> Those pretty women\n<$C> Women yeah \n<$A> Okay can we start with the women\n<$B> Okay there were two, weren't there two Eudokias,   I I  didn't know if that 's right   <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Either   Eudokia or Eb-do-ki-a   It doesn't  it doesn't, it doesn't   matter that much \n<$B>  Okay  \n<$B>  It was very   complicated One was the wife, of Michael\n<$A> One was the wife of Michael\n<$B> And one was the one that Michael actually preferred to   his wife  \n<$D>  It 's the one   that when she married the    the master \n<$B>  And he gave   her to, Basil\n<$A> To Basil\n<$D> And then there was the other I can't remember the name of the other one now\n<$B> And then there was a child as well wasn't there The Basil 's child eventually when he comes into the palace doesn't know whether, it 's his child or the result of of uhm Michael and\n<$A>   <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> \n<$?>  <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>  \n<$B> Yeah aye\n<$A> Right yes because the what what actually happens when they get, when they sort of get set up in the palace is that, Michael the Third makes, Basil repudiate his wife Maria, and then, Michael makes Basil marry, Michael 's mistress, Ebdokia Ingerina\n<$B> Why\n<$A> Because then, Michael the Third can ignore, his own wife Ebdokia, Decapolitissa, and concentrate his attentions on his mistress who is now, Basil 's wife\n<$B> Were the mistresses open then Or do you know like like France is it would be culturally different to be a mistress\n<$A> Right uhm\n<$B> Like would they have to be like, was Basil, used as a decoy for Michael to get near his\n<$A> Yes It 's used as a decoy because whilst normally the people who would be  who would be, the mistresses would probably be known At the same time it wasn't actually allowed So, that means that you, can't be too open about it Uhm, and so as Sean actually writes it 's not really a me/nage-a\\-trois because there 's four people in it So, uhm, and this is part of the problem is that because Basil 's the First 's wife Ebdokia was actually the mistress of Michael the Third, it 's unclear whether Leo the Sixth, who 's the successor to Basil the First was actually Basil the First 's son, or Michael the Third 's son Okay Yup\n<$B> See for a culture where you can, get artificial kinship and for the relations to be so strong, and yet you read about the untrust because he wasn't sure that it was son, I think that 's a bit contradictory Do you know where you can look there 's all these rituals that can make a kin, yet there 's this, was it like even, did he want them dead at one stage or something   Like \n<$A>  Yes   he did\n<$B> I mean that 's a bit extreme for somebody that you weren't could be your son Do you know what I mean\n<$A> Well yes it could be yours Right the thing is that that Leo the Sixth could be your son but the other thing is that your son, or the person who supposedly is your son has allegedly just tried to kill you So like the story is that Leo the Sixth attempted to assassinate   Basil the First So \n<$B>  <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear>   So it wasn't just to do with biology then It was to do with personalities\n<$A> Yeah It was to do with personalities and of course the struggle for power   as  everything normally is Uhm so it 's not just that he sort of took an extreme dislike, that Basil took an extreme dislike uh to Leo the Sixth Uhm now, the extent to which he had he had good cause, is unclear as well Right And the other thing to remember is that Leo the Sixth is actually, Basil, the First 's second son because the first son that he actually hoped would succeed him died young So there 's also part of a, a sort of, sort of mourning tied up in all that as well Okay\n<$D>  Right  \n<$D> So when when Basil is trying to uhm, I mean he infers that Michael is homosexual I mean wouldn't it be more accurate with all these you know women in the picture to kind of say he was bisexual I mean if you know maybe there was no term for that at that time Maybe it was just I mean, seen as quite acceptable that he could be with men or women and there wasn't that definition of it But wouldn't it be more accurate if he\n<$C> Mm you 're right there Like I mean if he was homosexual and he had a wife, why have a mistress on   top of that \n<$D>  Exactly   You know   if he maybe if he just  had a wife I would say well I mean it 'd probably   mean because  he was supposed to have a wife in order to   give him  an heir or whatever But if he also had a mistress I mean that would infer more that he, you know was attracted to this woman and obviously, so\n<$C>  <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>  \n<$?>  <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$A> Cos I mean the other thing is that that his mistress, he actually had his mistress before he got married, and then his mummy said no you have to get married and you can't marry her And so, his mummy found him a new wife or you know a   new woman  to be his wife But then he wouldn't give up the mistress and then that so And I mean yes probably, the way that we think of   things  it 's it would be more accurate to describe him as as bisexual rather than, as homosexual Uhm\n<$D>  More acceptable  \n<$D>  Mm  \n<$B> You know or if it 's not even about sexuality It 's about power or you know, something else rather than pleasure, that makes it even \n<$A> Sorry Hello  Uhm, yes but then is, sexuality not always about power\n<$D>   Mm \n<$B>  Aye  \n<$A> Uhm, but part of the problem ends up being, you know this is where it becomes you virtually encounter most directly, the the fact of, the difference between our society where we divide people, you know with monotonous regularity into, you know straights and gays and undecideds or or, homosexuals heterosexuals and bisexuals, or bodysexuals and you know it gets worse  Don't want to talk about it Uhm, and, medieval society where, they actually looked at what, they didn't actually look at the people they actually concentrated on what the people did And more often than not, admittedly it 's the Church that does the deciding, generally speaking and quite often they decide that everything that isn't, uhm, heterosexual intercourse within marriage, is wrong", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8c2f86fb-5b83-4ac8-ad1c-33a3ed9743a4", "added":

{"text": "<Sociolinguistics 2>\n\n\n<$A> Pragmatics and conversation then Uhm, normally for this class I need a, a board, cos we do a bit of a brain-storming session for this one, uhm thinking about conversation So uhm we 'll just talk about it first of all then without the board, try and do it without the board What do you think a conversation consists of What do you do when you 're having a conversation\n<$B>  Giving and receiving information \n<$A> Okay Is that just what it 's about\n<$C> Communicating with each other\n<$A> Right You 're communicating with each other What if you, if I asked you to think about the structure of a conversation, the what, are there rules first of all to having a conversation Or is it just random Is it just haphazard What do you think\n<$D> Well there is rules because I you know, what I did there was I interrupted you know so you basically you don't interrupt people, that 's that 's\n<$A> But you did interrupt   didn't you \n<$D>  I know   I did   But I didn't intend to \n<$A>  And I do it all the time   as I 'm doing it now\n\n<$A> So, is it okay to interrupt\n<$E>  You can, you can do it but if if you did do it all the time you 'd have no time to hear each other \n<$A> Yeah Yeah And it 's also very irritating isn't it as well if you 're on the receiving end of it all the time Uhm so what do you think Do you think there are rules to having a conversation Caroline, you were\n<$D> I do think there are rules but I don't think they 're actually uhm, they 're sort of like intuitive rules you know We  we sort of know the rules\n<$A> Right Right Well are they intuitive then or have you learnt them\n<$B>  We 've learnt them but they 've become subconscious \n<$D> Mm\n<$A> Right Okay Right, Okay So if we say there are rules, what are the rules to having a conversation What do you do to begin a conversation\n<$F> You form a sentence that applies to the person you 're talking to\n<$A> Okay so very specifically, those are very nice definitions everybody but let 's just be really basic about this What do you do when you meet somebody for the\n<$G> You say hello\n<$A> You say hello Right uhm, right so you 're walking down University Road and you 've got a class at ten o'clock and you see somebody and it 's five to ten Uhm, what do you say\n<$B>  Hi I can't stop \n<$A> Right Hi, can't stop, I 've got a class at the moment and my tutor 's really really cross, a really angry person, she 's been really horrible to us if we don't turn up on time Uhm, how else do you greet people\n<$C?> How are you doing\n<$A> How are you doing\n<$E>  You don't have to speak <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$A> Right Okay so non-verbally That 's non-verbal communication isn't it A head nod the greeting Uhm, are there gender differences there\n<$B>  I was just going to say, I don't think women do that as much mmm \n<$A> Yeah Yes I think again that 's something that boys learn to do, quite young Uhm back to the adolescent boys again, you know Carl what do you think\n<$G> What 's that\n<$A> Do you, listen to him He 's not listening to me  Uhm, how do you greet people\n<$G> Hello What 's the craic\n<$A> Do you Patrick says you do this kind of a head nod thing Do you do the head nod thing when you see someone\n<$G> Yeah\n<$A> Do you think that 's gender-specific\n<$H> It depends where you 're seeing them as well because if they 're a wee bit of distance away you would just nod but if they were you know closer to you or right there   you 'd  probably say hi\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yeah\n<$H> Do you know what I mean There 's no point in going like that  you know when the person 's right beside you \n<$A> Yeah But sometimes even that head nod seems not even as much as a head nod It can even be like a raising of the eyebrows just, you know  But in somehow it 's it 's a greeting of some sort isn't it Right Uhm, what happens if that greeting is absent,\n<unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$A> So can you just go straight on into the conversation as such then without having a greeting\n<$E>  It depends on your relationship with the person  , who it is  \n<$A>  It does  \n\n<$A> Yeah uhm, so you said about the weather We 're obsessed with this idea of the weather as well and you kind of feel that you have to comment upon the weather with everybody you meet Ah it 's cold today isn't it Yes but it 's not as cold as yesterday Yes   but it 's much colder than it was last week \n<$D>  But that 's something that we all have in common   That 's uh that 's like a a  it 's something that\n<$H> It 's safe isn't it\n<$D> Yeah it 's very safe There 's no real uh opinions as such that people can fall out about And the the weather for me uh because I live in Belfast is the same as the weather for you because you 're in Belfast as well and it 's, it 's very safe\n<$A> So what do you think that that strand is that that that goes through that that You know you feel that you need to , you you don't go straight up and in there, you know that you, you kind of skirt around this initial greeting What  what this is actually called is phatic communion Right Uh  phatic P H A T I C communion not communication Phatic communion And phatic communion developed the the idea <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> from a guy called Malinowski and he talked about phatic communion uhm as being, it 's it 's a bit like a kind of a social nicety, you know, you can talk about your conversation being phatic as it  having no real substance as such But it is very very pragmatic to be, to use phatic communion Because when you start off and you you know you 're you 're chatting to somebody and you 're being friendly and you go uhm, hi there Och hello how are you Right Now, when you say to somebody, hi how are you, what do you expect\n<$H>   A response \n<$B>   Fine How are you   \n<$A> Fine How are you What if somebody was, if you said to somebody uhm, hi there how are you How are you, and they said, well actually I 've got a really bad knee at the moment and I was at the hospital last week and you see the x-rays and, and and I had the flu the week before and So why would you say to them how are you if you weren't expecting a medical report\n<$G> Just a figure of speech I suppose to ease you into the conversation\n<$A> Yeah It 's phatic communion That 's what it 's about It 's the same as, oh hi isn't the weather lovely today Och isn't it 's a lovely mild day today And blah blah blah blah It 's all part of this initial ritual to get the conversation going And some people are actually more skilled at it than others as well Right so if that 's that 's the beginning of it, what happens at the end of the conversation What do you have to achieve at the end of it\n<$C?> Closure You 've got to say, got to go, cheerio\n<$A> Yeah See you soon\n<$C> See you soon\n<$A> What other ways do you say cheerio\n<$E>  Ta-ra \n<$A>  Ta-ra English man  Uhm, do you say that\n<$B>  No \n<$A> Uh, what else\n<$H> I I would say good bye and I 'd stop, or see you later so that they kind of have a you know <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Yeah Yeah Who would, who would say that closure 's important for them That they actually like to finalise that that conversation you know so that when you 're parting from somebody you do a final goodbye, cheerio, I 'll see you next week\n<$B>  You leave somebody on a good note so you can approach them again \n<$A> Yeah\n<$C> If you walk off in the middle of the conversation you 're going to look a bit weird\n<$A> Plenty of people do that Do you not know anybody who does that   People who just like  you 're chatting away and then, I mean there 's a colleague of mine at Jordanstown who does that She 's absolutely atrocious at closure She just in the middle of having a cup of coffee would just get up and walk off And we always, everybody kind of goes you know, oh, uhm, like, what did I do, you know, did I say Did I offend her You know\n<$D>  Just randomly walks off  \n<$B>  It depends how many people there are in the conversation like Because if there 's more than say  well   two people  then you can walk   off and  <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> can start talking Do you know, I mean if it was just two people you 'd look a bit weird \n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A>  Yes  \n<$E>  It 's the circumstances again as well and that 's what we were saying, you know If, in the in that we always assume there might be six of you in that, so you just got to come back, and you just pick up where you left off \n<$A> Yeah yeah yeah That 's true But if there 's only two of you it 's certainly not appropriate\n<$B>  Unless you 've had an argument, you would but that 's just if you 've had an argument <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$A> Yeah Absolutely Sharon Absolutely, yeah Indeed So uhm, so which do you think is more important then dynamically within the conversation, the greeting or the parting Or are they just equal\n<$E>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$H> I think they 're equal\n<$B>  But if you don't start a conversation nobody 's going to get anywhere \n<$A> Mm But I still think that a lot of people, you can just   go up to somebody \n<$H>  You could get away with   not starting it but you couldn't get away with you know not finishing\n<$A> Yes And I think that 's true I think that 's true I think what you 're saying is right Sharon What you  were saying, you know if you don't start it well then you 're not going to get anywhere, but, but I do think that you can start off by just you know uh, you could walk in and say you know uh to someone, what date does that essay have to be in for Right But if you walked off without saying cheerio maybe do your your friends might say, she 's not very friendly is she You know So we 've got greetings, we 've got phatic communion and we 've got partings at the other end What else is going on in a conversation\n<$E>  The actual conversation, in the middle \n<$A> Yeah Yeah The meat and potatoes of it all, or the vegetables if you 're a vegetarian Uhm, what else What do you do when you 're talking\n<$D> You take turns\n<$A> You take turns Yes Now how does that work Because you mentioned about interruptions\n<$D> Mhm\n<$A> Earlier on So, are you violating the speaker 's turn then if you 're you 're interrupting them\n<$D> Yes You are\n<$E>  <unclear> several words </unclear> \n<$D> That 's a good interruption, but to talk over somebody else,   you know sort of is a bad one \n<$A>  Well that 's an overlap  , which I 've just done there now  You become so aware of this don't you Yeah\n<$B>  If someone was struggling with something and you interrupted to help them, that 's, that could maybe be an interruption \n<$A> Yeah\n<$B>  <unclear> several words </unclear> \n<$A> Yeah Yeah So, I mean we ask a lot of questions don't we Sometimes it 's not just questions Sometimes it 's just, a lot of it is statement of facts or ideas, expressing your ideas Uhm sometimes we interrupt, sometimes there are overlaps When you speak, we start things, we get it wrong, we, there are lots of pauses, lots of uhms, ers, things like that What else\n<$?> Uh-huh uh-huh\n<$A> Right Feedback Mhm How do you know when it 's your turn to speak\n<$H?> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> you kind of recognise a pause, and then\n<$A> Okay so that 's one way You recognise a pause The speaker maybe has a breathing pause, or a pause at the end of some sort of clause, and then you know well, oh, this is my turn now, I can jump in here, I can take my turn at this point How else does it work\n<$H> You drop the pitch at the end of a sentence\n<$A> Yeah Or in a question perhaps you   raise it \n<$H>  Go up  \n<$A> Uh-huh\n<$C> Or in a classroom you put your hand up\n<$A> Okay yeah so very very specifically in that instance", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "7f67711e-92e8-48f6-aa18-1d7d62200d23", "added":

{"text": "<Byzantium 2>\n\n\n<$A> When did that evolve and become statute, or is it just there from, dot you know Christ You know what I mean\n<$B> Well no it 's not   just there \n<$A>  Or is it a   fusion of different things   you know \n<$B>  Well it 's   a fusion of different things And, alright cos what just  <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> what does Christ say about divorce\n<$?> <unclear> several words </unclear> \n<$B> He actually says that\n<$A> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$B> Yeah he actually says that there shouldn't be any\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> Right now the thing to remember is that, Jesus was brought up as a Jew and was acting as a rabbi, a teacher, and, was actually, answering questions on Jewish law Right And does Jewish law allow divorce The answer to that is yes it does\n<$C> Really\n<$A> Yep Alright The things you learn \n<$C> I didn't know that\n<$D> I didn't either I   thought  Jews 'd always been very like, stringently against divorce\n<$B>  Yes <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  \n<$B> Uhm no there is uh now it it tends to be, very rigorously well, nowadays it 's very rigorously defined because most Jews, follow, traditions that derive to some extent from the Rabbinic, tradition of Judaism which in Jesus ' time equates with the Pharisees Okay And nowadays if you want to get a, divorce according to <&Hebrew> halacha </&Hebrew> which is Jewish law you get what 's called a a <&Hebrew> get </&Hebrew>, which is a bill of divorcement And this bill of divorcement has to be written exactly, in, thirteen lines I think Anyway there 's a specific number of lines that it must be written in and it all must be you know done exactly like this And the nasty part is that only the man can do the divorcing   Alright so \n<$D>  Mm mm sorry I asked   that particular question\n<$B> He he actually presents the bill of divorcement to, her erstwhile wife And that 's why in orthodox Jewish communities you get things called, uhm, well it would be <&Hebrew> agunot </&Hebrew> which are chained women, because they 're chained because their husband has, left them but he hasn't actually divorced them according to Jewish law which means that they can't remarry according to Jewish law Right Which if you 're a devout Jew, is clearly a problem But so, Jesus in his teaching was actually more extreme, than the Jewish tradition in which he was sort of operating Alright Because he actually said you know they allow, divorce but I say to you there should be no divorce Right Now, how quickly did that well I mean then you have to get from the teachings of Jesus to, something that resembles, established Christianity And I mean that takes three centuries to do roughly Okay, so fast forward to three thirty AD which is a useful point in time but nothing more And by that stage, Christianity is more prevalent in, the Roman Empire than Judaism, had been, because Judaism constituted approximately one to two percent of the population of the Roman Empire, whereas Christianity in about three thirty constituted approximately ten percent, of the population, nine or ten percent\n<$C> Peter the\n<$B> Mm hm\n<$C> How did the Jews you 've been describing the Rabbi, how come it 's only two percent\n<$B> It 's a uh well  Sorry I 'm I 'm  not laughing at the question The simple answer is Saint Paul\n<$C> Saint Paul\n<$B> Saint Paul Well I mean okay but right\n<$A> He took up the mantle\n<$B> Yes And I mean if you actually think about the New Testament, exhibit A, which is, a copy of the Bible, Right\n<$A> So then   Christ said the word  of, as a as a Rabbi, Jew   <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>  and Paul interpreted that and changed it into Christianity\n<$B>  That <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Right well what, right the the this, right if you if   if you look \n<$A>  I know   nothing about the Bible as you   can tell  \n<$B>  Right well   basically the the the Gospels right there are four Gospels, and then there are the Acts of the Apostles Right And those, come from well those supposedly recount the mission of Christ on earth and then the Acts of the Apostles curiously enough the disciples afterwards Then you get all the, epistles and most of the epistles\n\n<$B> But Boswell also stops to wonder what sort of relationship it was He finds clarification by Basil 's subsequent, career with the hunk approving, Theopolitsis Right Theopolitsis is a courtier, who, sees Basil, and goes, that 's a bit of alright I 'll have some of that  and takes him into his service as a groom And then comes the horse-whisperer episode, when there 's a horse that nobody can calm down and Basil is summoned in to do it and does it And then he comes to the attention of   of  the Emperor, right, Michael the Third\n<$A>  Of  \n<$A> Can I ask you Peter in all the literature that 's been written, do they talk about normal sex ever I mean the the actual sex do they talk about between man men and women\n<$D>   Normal \n<$B>  Uhm   \n<$A> You know what I mean\n<$B>   Well \n<$D>  <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>   accepted\n<$A> It 's not accepting I mean just I mean is it reported I mean is it is this absence of, reported sex between this <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> you know thing, would that be because it just really wasn't talked about at all\n<$B> Part of it would be that\n<$A> Could that be just a normal sex thing going on and they didn't talk about that this was what was happening\n<$B> It 's right on an awful lot of our sources right an awful lot of Byzantine sources are actually religious sources, and curiously enough they don't actually talk about sex very much Right So that means that our body of sources sort of, are reduced There are some sources, from the eleventh and twelfth century I think specifically of what of there are things called the Romances There are novels And there 's a thing called, Digenis Akritas which is sort of the, the derring-do, adventures of, well Digenis Akritas means, twice born the border or And that 's this guy who lives on the eastern frontier and he has a whole series of adventures because his, mummy is a Christian but his daddy is Muslim and that 's he 's born from the two traditions And he has lots and lots of adventures about getting a girl, and uhm, keeping the girl and almost losing the girl And, he rapes an Amazon on the way past And you know there 's all this, stuff going on So sometimes they talk about, sex a little bit there but at the same time it tends to be a little bit, elusive So you tend not to get, you know  , they disappeared into the forest  and had sex You tend not to get that\n<$A>  But I think they  \n<$A> A bit vague\n<$B> It 's a bit vague\n<$A> And because maybe because religion a lot of religious, a lot of it when they do talk about like even somebody 's character, and they 're trying to pull them down through their sexual exploits or whatever it 's all negative Like it 's all the worst of the worst and   intrigue  and mistresses and You know you don't get a routine just two people having a relationship and going about their business You know It 's it 's all the other stuff all, because, maybe because it 's like well religious people generally are, very,   anti-sex   You know, it 's always got to be involved in some other kind of   plot  or or you know, mystique or something\n<$B>  Mm hm  \n<$D>  Religious  \n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B> Because the other thing is that obviously within Byzantine culture, there 's actually a very strong tradition that, asceticism is best, and that sort of celibacy and, you know, you only sort of you know did it once a quarter when you lie back and think of Byzantium and you never do it   otherwise You know \n<$A>  For the sake   of procreation\n<$B> Yeah, So there is that, then, in part that 's probably, a function of the kind of sources that 've survived Uhm because most of the Byzantine sources that we have, were saved by being kept in their monastery So they 're actually you know coming from monastic storerooms and things And so that means that, anything that would be a little bit dubious here  juicy, they wouldn't 've kept, right or might not 've kept\n<$D> Not having anything explicit as far as heterosexuality is concerned makes it just totally impossible to compare it then you know with homosexuality\n<$A> I never   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  It makes it   very very difficult Right And, a lot of people would actually say but because, you know, you can't get you know, confessions of a Byzantine lesbian  confessions of of a Byzantine gay man, right well that means that in actual fact you shouldn't you know I shouldn't be teaching this module\n<$D> No it 'll be <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> as well <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$B> Yes probably And I mean that 's one of the things that that, okay you know, to the extent that there is a political agenda going on in the module It 's that even though we don't have neat tidy sources that we can just go and look up, and flick over as we go and look there it is and sort of work out that you know seventeen point eight percent  did such and such two point five percent did such and such and the test sample, is you know, uhm ten thousand people which constitutes so many percent of the total Byzantine population for the thousand years of you know We don't have any of that Right So that means that probably as far as as sort of the, uhm, Economic and Social Science Faculty down the road it 's sort of you know oh well it 's all meaningless then Right But then, because, it is a kind of, history that should be there, and it was part of experience we actually need to look at how we look at the sources, and then ask the questions of exactly how far can we push, the sources and what sort of questions can we ask them And that 's\n<$D> Yeah the thing I <unclear> several sylls </unclear> A lot of people are ignored and and written out of things I think in those days it 's just that, sex was just written out So it wasn't anything to do with homosexuals or heterosexuals, just sex\n<$B> A  a lot of that is true Now, part of it where where it sort of, where that argument tends to fall down is that there are collections of what are known as penitentials And those are the the the penalty rates for all the Christian sins And, sometimes they can be quite A explicit and B go into more detail than   you think is \n<$A>  Than you   need to know \n<$B> Well than you think is healthy For some reason Father confessors uhm, I mean some of the famous ones actually come from Ireland uhm, which obviously little Irish monks sitting alone,  on a little island, in the middle of of a   law , decided you know I 've got to do something to kill my time  And so they write these things that you know and there there 's you know there 's a whole scale of penalties And you know, oral sex for   the first time  counts for so and so and oral sex you know more than once counts for so much and you know It 's all, listed out Now, the Byzantines have penitentials as well, but they tend not to be quite so explicit, or quite so detailed, but at the same time they do actually make distinctions Uhm and so they will you know they will have penalties for, fornication and penalties for sodomy and penalties for oral sex and, you know, the rest of it\n<$D>  Craggy Rock

that chapter because I didn't do it But in the next chapter, the nouns chapter I did that and about half a dozen of the words which you 'd use a lot like man and son and it was used in the same context as they use them as the in the examples\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> Next page like, drop mouthful plenty And then the top of page twenty-three the, none of that made sense to me at all I 'd never heard of half of that stuff There 's a  lot of stuff that sort of sounds quite familiar but that 's about it\n<$A> Did anybody else do the chapter on nouns\n<$C> > Well I kind of did but I mean it didn't sound familiar to our kind of names so, I don't think it 's going to be a really useful, uh uhm well I don't think it 's going to be of any use Uhm you recognise names or different things compared to English but the rest is just Chinese to me \n<$A> Did everybody notice a dictionary at the back  It took me a while to work that out, So so far the words are near enough what we would use here apart from\n<$B> Some of them some of them Some of them you just recognise them because you might be familiar with the Scottish dialect as well But there is definitely words there that we would use yeah, in everyday speech\n<$A> But do you think there have been some of them that have been in the uhm you know have been in the vocabulary but they 've dropped out You know what I mean more rural\n<$B> Oh I know what I know what you mean but I  I couldn't I couldn't answer the question Haven't a clue Maybe <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Well for example see the expressions in the nouns, would you use any of them Or are they are they just\n<$B> Where are you What page are you\n<$A> Uh page twenty-four, There that, it 's that starts after certain nouns and then gives examples\n<$B> I would use the ones at the bottom there, saying at the at the stair foot and stuff like that there definitely used them before yeah But, not very often And the last one there 's a place under that called Waterfoot I don't know if that 's anything to do with it or not \n<$A> And what about the plurals Would anybody use any of them, Are they just totally\n<$B> Och no no Some of them you would Like you would use, if you 're describing a number of miles in the plural you would sometimes just say it in the singular Say something 's thirty mile away instead of saying it 's thirty miles away in Donegal And it 's the same with years You know sometimes you would express a a number of years and just say year at the end of it,\n<$A> We 'll move on to the next chapter Uhm pronouns Did anybody do pronouns, No\n\n<$A> What about the demonstrative pronouns Does everybody use them I think they 're near enough pretty universal in Northern Ireland anyway\n<$B> It 's just it 's just a different pronunciation with the same words that we would use\n<$A> Mhm Aye some of the spellings are a bit confusing It took me a while to work out what they were trying to trying to get at, I 'm looking at the reflexive pronouns They 're really <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> too\n<$B> Aye we would use ourselves and yourselves and stuff like that there\n<$A> Mhm, And indefinite pronouns I know some of them are definitely used in County Antrim Like we  we uh you know uhm down kind of Down direction but uhm like there 's fellas I know and they talk about a a body, as in a person but we wouldn't we wouldn't say that\n<$B> I 've heard it I 've heard it I wouldn't ever use it myself Or none of my immediate relations or friends would use that but <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> That 's probably a bit of a more old-fashioned thing actually\n<$A> Aye it 's maybe just more rural areas <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>, Did anybody do the adjectives chapter, I think quite a few of these I wouldn't use myself Don't know about anybody else but uhm it was it nearly took me to the bottom of page thirty-seven before I found something I would say myself\n<$D> If you 'd maybe give examples those of you who agree or you know uhm findings that you would say, maybe give examples of this for the benefit of the international students who I 'm sure, I 'm sure it 's not very familiar to them So, maybe that example Jessie at the bottom of page thirty-seven you were talking about\n<$A> Well it 's uhm,  It 's an ill burd that fyles its ain nest  I 'll, we 'd use that sort of general, generally\n<$D> Meaning bad\n<$A> Mhm\n\n<$A> What about the numerals on page forty-four Does anybody use them, Cos I know we would use a few of them but we wouldn't  necessarily use all of them Like we would say \" nocht \" instead of \" nought \" Or yin or twa And then the rest of them 's near enough the same But then you get to a hunder and a thousan you 'd take the\n<$B> Don't really get the, see like the nocht and the yin and the twa, we don't we don't really use them Like there 's places right about Antrim they would use that like Rathlin Island and stuff like that but I would never use them\n<$A> No we wouldn't necessarily use them all the time but it 's just, you know, I don't know say there was Kit-Kats in the fridge or something and there was a packet of them and you went there and somebody said how many 's and you 'd say oh just just the yin left, Would you, would youse use \" aye \" instead of \" always \", Or does everybody use the standard English form, Will we go on to the next chapter Did anybody do verbal forms\n<$D> By do do you mean read or do you mean\n<$A> Uh no read over it or   look at or \n<$D>  That 's what I 'm a  , that 's what I asked you to do just to look at\n<$A> Mhm, I thought they were pretty straightforward to tell you the truth They were, there was nothing new\n<$B> It was all quite basic yeah\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Will we move on then\n\n<$A> Adverbs I thought were pretty\n<$E> What page is that on\n<$A> Sorry uh Seventy-three I thought they were pretty straightforward as well Bar a few of them like\n<$F> Did you read the whole book\n<$A> I just just happened to <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>, I 'm reading it as I go along and then I did adverbs and, whatever the next one is Conjunctions I did those\n<$B> I did conjunctions as well cos it was the shortest chapter\n<$A>  Well I thought I deserved doing a shorter chapter for adverbs was pretty long\n<$B> What 's the craic with adverbs then What 's going on in there\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> What 's going on with the adverbs\n<$A> Och the adverbs they 're straightforward enough Like we would use them every day There 's only a wheen that we wouldn't use\n<$B> Only a wheen\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> Only a wheen\n<$A>  Give over, There was some of them I didn't get at all\n<$B> What ones\n<$A> See in seventy-seven\n<$B> Uh-huh\n<$A>  That wund is byordnar snell  I didn't get it at all I think I looked looked it up in the dictionary like but I wouldn't use it\n<$E> Has it got something to do with smell or something\n<$A> Aye it 's supposed to be unusual But, uh seventy-seven The rest of it was, pretty straightforward I thought, What about the idiomatic expressions on eighty-one Anybody recognise them or use them or think they were strange or, The only one I think I didn't get was  like the bars o Ayr  We wouldn't use that That 's a Scoticism because Ayr 's in Scotland, but we 'd probably use something different And one I couldn't get, I know what it means and I know the context you use it but I couldn't think of anything to translate it was, \" aince eirant \" I know what, I know when to use it but I couldn't tell you how to translate it and it 's not in the back\n<$E> Where is it\n<$A> Uh it is eighty-two See uh where it says region,  A 'm no guan doun the toun aince eirant for ti buy saut  <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> I didn't get, I know it but I don't know how you translate it In fact I don't think you ever need it really in spoken English It 's just like a wee extra insertion I suppose, that you don't really need Did  everybody else sort of find that, familiar enough or not familiar at all,\n<$B> A lot of them I 've heard before but I never use them\n<$G> I only recognise a couple of them, like <unclear> several words </unclear> or  when aw said an duin \n<$A> Mhm, Would anybody use if you were saying, like it 's, you know if two people fell out over something, would you say \" ower the heid of it \", no\n<$F> What is it\n<$A> Ower the heid of it Like they fell out ower the ower the heid of\n<$F> But I 'd say \" over the head of \" not whatever that is \n<$A> That 's the same that 's the same difference only they take one letter out and put another one in\n<$F> But why, I, no I wouldn't say \" ower the heid \" I would say \" over the head of \"\n<$A>   Aye \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$A> There that 's\n<$B> Pronouncing difference\n<$A> Aye, Will we move on to conjunctions Would anybody happen to have a hanky My nose is running No I 'll just sniff Uhm, conjunctions I thought they were straightforward enough too Anybody any problem with them\n<$B> A lot of them are just you know the same word pronounced slightly differently\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> exactly the same\n<$E> Do you use \" as \" for \" than \"\n<$A> Mm\n<$E> \" As \" for \" than \"\n<$B> No\n<$A> No\n<$E> \" Beis \", compared with\n<$B> No\n<$A> No Wouldn't use that either And I wouldn't use \" binna \" either Or \" or \" for \" before \" And we wouldn't use \" frae \", we 'd use \" fae \" We 'd take the take the R out, for \" from \"\n<$E> \" Kis \" for \" because \"\n<$A> Well I suppose if you think about it it 's, you know the way you say \" cos \"\n<$E> Aye\n<$A> It 's the same sort of difference only it 's said a different way, I think this is pretty much\n<$F> What 's the different between T H O and T H O U G H Cos they 're both said exactly the same way\n<$A> That 's what I thought It 's just kind of the same thing I suppose they have to spell it differently there\n<$B> Some of their spelling 's exactly the same which is stupid  But but for 's for <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$E> What about \" while \"\n<$A> Where are you \" While \" Well you say I suppose people here, uh would say while where we might say wile instead of wile, while even  Somebody help me out here I can't say the two of them differently so Say while, I think we 'll move on to prepositions\n<$B> Aye\n<$A> Would any, uh before we go on to them, see eighty-six Uhm <unclear> several sylls </unclear> uhm we 'd that one the other day you know that uhm, what do you call it, that questionnaire thing we did You know the way it said uhm,  Are you going out and it raining  Would youse use that\n<$B>   Yeah \n<$F>  Yeah  \n<$A> I was just wondering Cos I just saw that, mother you 're sure surely never going to play tennis and you pregnant That 's the same sort of idea I was just wondering you know if anybody would use it What about the prepositions, which I personally haven't looked at it like", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<Law tutorial 1>\n\n\n<$A> Uhm and I 'll suggest to you that there are three main types and Maire will tell us one of the three main types of harm in relation, or in respect of which a duty of care can be owed\n<$B> Physical harm\n<$A> Right Physical harm, including what, Uh uh uh physical harm  including what, I mean\n<$C> Psychiatric harm\n<$A> Right psychiatric harm I mean that that 's, yeah Physical harm including psychiatric harm A duty of care can be owed in relation to what else Ken,\n<$D> Financial loss\n<$A> Right, economic loss And what 's the other category William\n<$E> Property damage\n<$A> Right Damage to property So we 're going to look at those three Uh  we 're going to look at psychiatric harm first of all and then we 'll look just very shortly at the relationship between damage to property and damage, or sorry economic loss because uhm there 's one case in particular that illustrates that there 's not always a bright line distinction between the two, Right physical harm including psychiatric harm is, and we we 'll talk about  the  psychiatric aspect of it, the psychiatric harm aspect We 've already looked at a lot of cases where somebody suffers an injury for example they lose a leg, Baker and Willoughby and so on and so forth Uhm, the literature makes a distinction between two types of victims for purposes of psychiatric harm What are they\n<$C> Primary and secondary\n<$A> Right primary and secondary uhm victims Can you tell us what a primary victim is then\n<$C> Uhm that was, that 's somebody who has had the actual harm done to them, no in fact was actually at the accident or the incident personally there\n<$A> Mhm\n<$C> And witnessed everything first hand, as it happened to them\n<$A> Yeah Yeah Happened happened to them is is the key The  the primary victim is somebody for example who 's in a car crash and they they 're they 're injured they suffer physical injuries and they subsequently develop psychiatric injuries after that They 're called the primary victim Or there 's a case called Paige and Smith Did anybody come across the  case Paige and Smith, which is a slight variation on that Anybody Was well it was basically somebody was in an  in an accident but they didn't suffer any physical injury but they they went on to develop psychiatric injuries anyway Uh it was held that a duty of care prevailed in that instance as well and that that was a primary victim So a primary victim is somebody who 's injured, they suffer physical injury or it could be somebody standing for example at a bus stop and a bus uh mounts the pavement and you know basically takes the end off their nose but they don't suffer any physical injury but they develop psychiatric uh injuries as a result of that They 're primary victims What 's a secondary victim then, Carl\n<$F> It 's when uhm somebody who 's related to the victim or suffers psychiatric damage from someone else 's injury Like there was a case of a mother and a car crash wasn't there\n<$A> Yeah Yeah and there 's there 's McLoughlin and O'Brien Is that the case Right  can you tell us a little bit about that case What\n<$F> It 's the one with a mother where uhm she was phoned up to say that her family had been in a car accident   and  she rushed over to the hospital and she got there and she found them all injured and one of them dead And she went on to suffer post-traumatic stress or something was it\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A> Mhm And what did the court say were the conditions that governed\n<$F> What was Immediate aftermath was one it was\n<$A> Right immediate aftermath And what was it,   you used the word actually earlier on I mean a mother and daughter are what Or mother and children are what\n<$?> Next-of-kin\n<$A> Right Or or family Or basically uhm McLoughlin and O'Brien said that you can sue,  a secondary victim can sue if they can establish first of all a close tie of love or affection Yeah go ahead\n<$G> Can I just ask, is uhm can you be a secondary victim uh just with onlooking, without actually having any emotional ties to the people Can that count   like  if, if you see an accident   without  being personally involved with it\n<$A>  No well  \n<$A>  No  \n<$A> No there 's there 's the close tie of love and affection thing If if you look at the uhm, we 'll come we 'll come back and we 'll talk about the White case in a moment uh which is where some police officers failed on the on the secondary victim or because they didn't have close ties of love and affection Uhm but it 's  uhm you you can succeed if you can show that you 've a close tie of love or affection with the primary victim, for for example a parent and the child or spouse or some <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> And uh one of these elusive phrases there 's a proximity in time and in place to the accident So in McLoughlin and O'Brien the mother of the uh children arrived at the hospital afterwards but there was sufficient proximity in time and uh place to the accident Uh I 'm I 'm going through this very quickly because I want, as I say I want to go and I want to concentrate on the local authority stuff so if you 've any questions as we 're going through this uh  raise your hand and ask them What about the White case William can you tell us basically the context of the White case\n<$E> Uhm, was that uhm, was that something to do with Hillsborough or am I thinking of something else\n<$A> Yeah that was yeah\n<$E> Uhm a claim by five police officers who said they 'd suffered uhm physical or sorry psychiatric injury due to the duties they undertook And uh the House of Lords decided that three to two that uhm the defendants were not liable because uhm what was what were you saying there about no ties of love and affection yeah\n<$A> Yeah Yeah In  in relation to  the argument that they could be secondary victims the House of Lords said well there 's there 's no tie of love or affection What was what was the wider context cos there 's there 's another good example of another one of these very obvious uhm cases where the House of Lords decides that we have to come up with a particular outcome What was the backdrop to this case I mean one of the cases that preceded it is discussed in it\n<$D> Alcock\n<$A> Right the Alcock case can you tell us about it I mean not not in any detail, but  what basically happened in that case\n<$D> Uh sixteen secondary victims sued for damage and they did not meet the three criteria set out for secondary victims, love and affection, immediate aftermath, uhm direct perception of the\n<$A> Mhm Yeah The Alcock case, the the the Alcock case the courts modified uhm McLoughlin and O'Brien and added in I think they used phrases, I mean what was the phrase you used, direct, , direct observation or something\n<$E> Direct perception\n<$A> Direct perception Uh a phrase sometimes used as well is that you witnessed the event with your own unaided senses because some, many of these victims were people who had watched, were relatives who had  watched the uh images of the Hillsborough disaster on television and uh the courts said well this isn't your own unaided, uh, but any, the context, the the the point that goes with the context was basically relatives of people who 'd been killed in the Hillsborough disaster uhm were unable to claim damages as secondary victims What happened in the White case uh initially Cos this was a case involving police officers who who had been on the scene They hadn't actually been involved in pulling people out necessarily, so, but they 'd been on the scene at Hillsborough What what what happened then And why was this such a political judgement on the part of the House of Lords, or not political, sorry but not political with a small P or politically correct if you like\n<$H> Uhm there well there was difficulty uhm with people that seen it on television making claims Uhm is that\n<$A> Well the the that goes to the main, well the the difficulty basically that the House of Lords uh and I think Lord Hoffman identified it himself he said look hold on a second, the relatives of these people weren't going weren't able to succeed in the Alcock case uhm and basically it 's going to appear as a manifest injustice if the relatives of people who have been killed can't recover damages but police officers who were there working are able to recover damages Uhm there are a whole, there there are several lines of argument and there 's an argument about the employer 's responsibility to his employees or to uhm and, and uhm it 's been argued that uh the employer would get, the employer owes a duty in respect of physical well-being also owes owes a duty of care in respect of uh psychiatric well-being And the House of Lords said well yeah but there 's no physical injury in this case so the the arguments about psychiatric injury don't follow through It also said they 're not secondary victims They can't claim as secondary victims because as William said they don't have the  the requisite tie of love and affection Uh there 's also a point about rescuers and if you 're a rescuer you may be able to uhm obtain damages for psychiatric injury but the House of Lords again said well rescuers yes but that would imply that there was some sort of physical threat themselves and said the police officer, one of the police officers who was claiming was at the morgue and they said well there there 's no question uh that these people were in any physical danger so therefore they can't succeed as rescuers either The White case Uhm, what about the W and Essex County Council case This is uh uh one that leads neatly to consideration of the local authority case law more fully W and Essex County Council There was great excitement this year because there was an Essex County Council case reported on the news in the morning and we thought this was going to be W and Essex but it wasn't But what happened in W and Essex First of all   what had happened in the W and Essex case,\n<$E?> The plaintiffs were parents of four young children who had agreed to adopt an adolescent   They  uhm uh spoke to Essex County Council and said they were very very definitely not prepared to take anybody in who had a history of child abuse\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A> Mhm\n<$E?> And of course they got somebody who 'd uhm been accused of abusing his sister and some other unsavoury behaviour and uhm he uh was claimed to have abused all four of the children and the family said as a result they suffered uhm psychiatric psychiatric illness\n<$A> Who who who suffered\n<$E> The uh children and the parents\n<$A> Yeah well the the, yeah, right\n<$E> And uh I think uh this, was this a, case was a  preliminary question wasn't it\n<$A> Yes Now tell tell us what the preliminary point is cos this is very important when we move on what we <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>\n<$E> In the wake of, can't remember what case case it was in the wake of actually but uhm a lot of cases were being struck out, but   because the courts  were saying there 's no duty of care so this won't go any further\n<$A>  On  what  \n<$A> Yeah This was, this was we 're going to talk more about striking out later on but basically this case had been struck out on a preliminary point that hadn't gone to a full hearing Uhm and, what   was the point about psychiatric harm, we 'll come back to striking out, you can bear that in mind uh for the moment What was the point about psychiatric harm in this case\n<$?> Whether they were going to equate it with physical harm or not\n<$A> Whether there was what sorry\n<$?> They were going to equate it with physical injury\n<$A> Right there was this question about physical injury and also there  there was a point about time and place, proximity in time and place And what what did the House of Lord, what did the House of Lords basically say in W and Essex County Council about psychiatric injury You 're right, they were talking about equating it with physical injury and they also said something about the McLoughlin and O'Brien type approach to proximity in time and place Because basically the children had been abused over a period of time and then the parents hadn't witnessed this but then uhm the children had uh suffered obviously as a result of this and the parents claimed that they were suffering as a result of this What did the court say about their approach to the question of time and place in psychiatric injury Anybody\n<$E> It depends on the facts of the case", "subdomain":

{"text": "<Enneagram>\n\n\n<$A> Nines take the really big huge things that matter and they diminish them down by saying, sure they 're not really that important And they are that important But the nine diminishes that down and so they sort of treat it like, it 's no big deal\n<$B> Is that their way of coping   do you think then \n<$A>  That 's their way of coping   It 's no big deal And actually nines do get under a lot of pressure and the one thing that always gets them under pressure is a deadline Nines hate deadlines And you know, they never produce right up until the last minute It 'll always be the eleventh hour for the nines No matter if you give them something, an assignment nine months prior to that, they only get around to doing it maybe nine hours before it 's due to be in if even\n<$C> Basically the longer you give them, the worse they are at getting their act together\n<$A> Yes yes and, and, and I mean I was taught, my friend Bernard This is the Jesuit priest who taught me so much about the enneagram was himself a nine, the loveliest loveliest man in the world   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$D>  Why do they   fear confrontation and other things\n<$A> They don't because it upsets the harmony, it upsets their harmony and that 's\n<$D> Is it fear\n<$A> It 's not that it 's fear It 's it 's about unsettling their comfortability, their comfort zone Nines are very much into their comfort zones you know So they, and they don't like those comfort zones to be in some way upset, you know so conflict especially threatens that and actually nines can actually physically feel that conflict  internally, like in their gut They can actually suffer from stomach problems then you know because of that you know because you know it does physically upset them And again the more laid-back they 're looking to us, sometimes the more pressure they 're actually under And they 're feeling it You know  I when when the nine panel got up with Helen Palmer they said, like don't be fooled by this The more laid-back we look, the more pressure sometimes we 're under But like here we go, we 're giving out this, again we 're giving out this perception of <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$E> So it is only perception then\n<$A> It can only be perception\n<$E> And is that so for all the types, it 's only perceptions that we\n<$A> No not all You know but again it 's how we perceive them to be may not be truly what 's   going on  for them underneath But again, it 's what, like type nines are usually warm friendly tolerant accommodating uncompetitive, okay They prefer a peaceful structure, predictable and comfortable life and they like to fit in So they 've a lot of similarities here with two They 've difficulty saying no But again it 's for different reasons The no doesn't like, the two doesn't like to say no in case you don't like them and fall out with them and aren't their friend any more, and the two thinks, oh God if I say no and then that might cause conflict and then och sure it 's just easier to go along and say yes and at the end of the day it may not turn up So that 's alright\n<$E>  What 's going on  \n\n<$A> I mean I know even some of my friends who  and again it 's probably a bit of their sub-type coming in here which differentiates them But they would even keep particular things in the house, that you know, like even if it was food, particular things that if they ever run out of them you would never have to you know actually get up you know You know my nine friend I 'm talking about, she lives on her own and she has this list of these particular things, like say there were four items and you go to her cupboards and like I always say you 'd think the war was coming, cos they 're stocked with all these things that, these particular things that she likes and her whole thing is, like see if she run out of something, uhm rather than maybe get herself up and go to the supermarket and get it, she would eat whatever   you know was there \n<$B?>  Something else which they really like  \n<$A> Something else she really liked but it, it was you know rather than that And she would say that she keeps these particular things in storage, so that uhm   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$B?>  So she   wouldn't even go into them\n<$A>   Oh she would  go into them but she always keeps certainly you know a substantial stock of them Like you know she said if it was a particular type of tuna she 'd buy like ten tins She lives on her own Or if it was a particular type of juice that she drinks she would get in ten bottles of that So she nearly like collects these things uhm and that 's her self-preservation sort of side of her coming out, whereas you know rather than maybe have to go out and be use up the energy you know and then like she knows that they 're in the house and they 're there You know So what time is it\n<$B>  Oh she would  \n<$?>   Nine o'clock \n<$?>  Nine o'clock \n<$?>  After nine  \n<$A> Any thoughts on nine We can finish off a wee bit on nine Does that make\n<$B?> I know a nine, well she says she 's a nine, she 's been to your class and her mum as well, they 're both nines Her mum is a stereotype nine,   you can see \n<$A>  Oh she 's  , oh God   Absolutely \n<$B>  Absolute classic   But my friend isn't a   typical  nine\n<$A>  Oh aye   No I know\n<$B> And I 've kind of hinted to her and she said   No I 'm definitely a nine  I can see a whole lot of things\n<$A>  Well I, well  \n<$A> I see a lot of it, but she 's actually quite assertive You know I don't see her as having a problem in being assertive There 's certainly aspects of her nine that I can see very clearly\n<$B> The laid-back, the\n<$A> Yeah but sometimes I think there 's a lot of six there, you know in her as well you know We actually have this\n<$B> Do you think that too\n<$A> Sometimes yeah because I do find her mother, you know cos she sent her mother to and, she sent her mother to my class and her mother took great offence at me saying that nines were self-forgetting and they forgot things And do you remember she went home and she said, I cannot believe, do you know what that Nano one said, that Nano one said that Nano one said de de de, and she stopped off at, and they do forget things and her mother  called to her house to tell her all of this and then drove off without her handbag and her coat And then got home and my friend couldn't wait to ring her up and say, hello did you forget something\n<$E> And she proved the point that she was making\n<$A> Proved that point that I was making\n<$B> But every single thing you said is the mummy Everything\n<$A> Oh aye, you know\n<$B> Won't confront anything,   won't face anything at all    And  as you know we 've seen   the poor woman and everybody,  one particular time you know and she was so   so  she just could not cope with it She didn't know what to do so she didn't do anything   if you know what I mean  She just couldn't face it And inwardly she was obviously suffering big-time But it 's just, it 's funny you said that cos I used to say to my friend, are you sure you 're a nine   Cos she, cos see  when you were doing something, she would say, look excuse me I have to say this to you I don't really like that And I 'm thinking, how could she be a nine And yet she thinks she 's a nine but I mean, I 'm not sure now\n<$A>  Won't face anything <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$A>  I know  \n<$A>  Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh  \n<$A>  Uh-huh  \n<$A>  Anything yeah uh-huh  \n<$A>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$A> Aye I know Well I would still have that sort of debate with her that she might have a lot of you know sort of six and her mum definitely\n<$B> Oh the mum 's a classic case\n<$A> Oh she, but she, it 's nearly to the point where it 's funny You know she is You know\n<$E> But Nano, can can <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>, must everyone be a particular number Can you be between numbers or is there   always a dominant \n<$A>  No there 's  , no there 'll always be, there 'll always be, you 'll always be that core number   You have a  core number, you know and, and you 'll never change that You know you won't change that <unclear> several sylls </unclear> You will always be that number You will always be the seven or the four or the two or whatever it is you know\n<$?>  You 've got a, a sort of a  \n<$D> Can a healthy nine not be lazy\n<$A> Oh yes You see if the nine is motivated enough, yes It 's all about what, where the nine lacks is sort of, the nine almost needs like outside stimulus to get them going I always think of nines as those, you know those old cars where you used to put the\n<$?> Crank it up\n<$A> You used to crank them up and then you 'd crank them up and the engine would start running and then they 're really on a roll Well the nines need that sort of stimulus So in other words if nines uhm are really into something whether it be their work or whatever it is, nines are, you know it 's not that once they 're on a roll they 're on a roll But again sometimes they lack maybe the self-motivation or the stimulus and they rely on something outside of themselves or somebody outside of themselves There was a a woman in one of the, I did a weekend there last year in Crossgar and, what do you call that place no not Crossgar, Benburb or somewhere and there was a girl there and she was a nine She was a teacher and she was talking about where she really had a very bad patch of stress, so much so that it really floored her and she was, she had to come out of school like she was moved back to her family home in the country with her parents And of course when the nine really hits low like that it can be total inactivity, you know no energy, total apathy, lose all you know even sort of And I asked her, you know I said, well what brought you out of it I wish I had 've taped her because she was a wonderful example of, she explained it so well, this nine under extreme stress And she said her sister was a type eight And her sister came down and demanded, right, that 's it, you 're not lying like that anymore Right Literally pulled her to her feet and more or less   dragged her wouldn't  take no for an answer, dragged her back up and sort of gave her you know you know, she said like, it took my sister to do that, because she just didn't have that in herself you know to help her\n<$B>  Wouldn't take no for an answer  \n<$B> But she must have chosen, to go along with her sister   I mean she could have put her head down and just ignored her \n<$A>  Och yeah well   she probably yes could well you would be hard to now <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> is concerned and they were saying, no you may well have to get yourself in She said that was the start of the   road back  to sort of health But uhm she said like you know and, when I got into that like I mean I could just literally do nothing And total you know inactivity, you know But yes, that 's that 's not to say that uhm, as I say there is Because when they are, it was funny, when I did the nines in the prison like there was a nine in the group\n<$?>  Yes  \n\n<$A> And of course all of them are saying oh, he 's not a lazy bastard after all He 's just a nine Whereas they would have referred to him as a lazy bastard because all he seemed to do was sleep You know, and nines, you know can find it, nines could, like I 've had one two three, three nine men in my classes at different times and at one stage I 'd two nine men together and one of them used to come every week and fell asleep on the chair and he was asleep sometimes for half the class", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

evening 's session, the uhm there 's a couple of things First of all I want to pick up pick up on some of the issues that we touched on last week around issues of uhm sort of rights and and diversity and difference Uhm and so I want to cover some issues around that first of all, some, some some data and information around that and that 's partly why I gave you this uhm that little questionnaire on ethnic minorities That was used in a uhm little study that uh I was involved in a couple of years ago, where we certainly got a large number of teachers to try and get a sense of uhm the extent to which uh teachers were aware of uh some of these uh issues related to ethnic minorities, and so uh just wanted to, I gave you that questionnaire, your responses with the primary responses from the larger group of teachers that we uhm we were engaged with The uhm, uh, and then I want to give the time to talk through some of the stuff that 's coming out of the yellow forms, I mean, uh the assignment, uh well the impression I get is that everything 's fine No problem  The uh, uh, and then the uhm, uh the the last part of the session I want to start addressing the issue about uhm the role of of uh schools uh in uh addressing reconciliation and tolerance and some of the ways in which that has been addressed over the years Okay, so that 's the sort of agenda for this evening 's session First of all, is there anything coming out of last week that that anyone wanted to revisit briefly Uh last week we spent most of the time playing games , so uhm uh okay so if there 's nothing there, okay what I want to do then in this first session is just look look at some, some issues around uh gender and and and race really Uhm, and the first thing I want to look at is, is some issues around gender By tradition uh gender issues in education have have tended to to revolve around the uhm uh, have tended to revolve around uh the uh the differential and unfair treatment accorded to girls Uh traditionally it was uh close enough access to uh to girls, with particular aspects of the curriculum uhm uh so there 's actually still, I mean if you look back at uh educational, official documents produced even as late as the nineteen sixties, it really is quite astonishing the uh, the some of the basic taken-for-granted assumptions there were about the type of curriculum that was appropriate for boys and for girls and how different they were and how this wasn't, it was never it didn't appear to be seen as an issue at all And a lot of the stuff that was written around gender issues in education in the sixties and the nineteen seventies uh revolved around that that particular issue, attempts to try and promote equal opportunities uh for girls and uh and women Uhm more recently the, that has changed Uh and in some  respects that has changed in a bizarre way right  in the other direction, uhm it 's now, a lot of the uhm official talk in terms of gender in education being about the under-achievement of boys\n\n<$A> So this this is a fairly simple way of analysing a relationship between two variables This is for all the, the co-ed uh grammar schools in uh ninety-eight ninety-nine So, the that 's what the graph is about but but what can we conclude from the graph\n<$E> Considerably more girls ' schools, that girls are, seem to be achieving more than boys, one two three four, boys ' schools or co-ed schools or whatever are actually, you know the boys are out, the over-achieving girls\n<$A> Yeah And even in three of those cases those three, the difference is relatively small They 're not that, they 're not that uh widely different from the this uh sort of common common common line This is the only case where there 's, the proportion of boys is markedly higher than the proportion of girls And in all the other cases uh the proportion of girls <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> is higher than the proportion of boys in the picture Okay so that would suggest, what\n<$F> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> doing better than boys, you know they 've done better in the results, whatever the underlying reasons for it are\n<$A> Right okay, so, so in terms of the co-ed grammar schools the, that evidence suggests that by and large the girls are doing better than the boys, in <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> education Okay The uhm, this is the data for uh single-sex grammar schools where the yellow dots are the uhm single-sex girls ' schools and the white dots are the single-sex uh boys ' schools Uh and you can't obviously put them in the same type of graph because they 're different schools, okay so they 're not, you can't simply compare them in the same the same sort of uh sort of way So what I 've done is simply to rank order the scores for the uh proportions for the  for the boys and for the girls from the lowest to the highest Okay so that 's simply the rank order of the girls ' schools, all single-sex girls ' schools from the highest, or uh sorry from the lowest to the highest and the boys ' schools from the lowest to the highest <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> There 's three more uh girls ' schools which is why the the boys are there and there So, what can we tell from that\n<$G> Girls outperform boys again\n<$A> Right okay Is it as simple as that\n<$H> It 's more, it 's, girls ' uh grammar schools are very consistent in high performance\n<$A> Yeah Yeah So there 's there 's a great consistency in in the in the girls ' schools So the the lowest is eighty-nine percent, uh the highest one hundred percent So quite a narrow, uh a narrow sort of variation across them A much wider variation across the boys ' schools for some reason Uh anything else,\n<$I> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$A> Well that 's just the, I just put these in the the same, the single-sex boys ' schools, this is the one that had the lowest   and  again that 's the one with the highest I put them in that rank order, Is it the case that all the girls ' schools schools are doing better than all the boys ' schools\n<$I>  Right so that 's  \n<$?>   No \n<$J>  No   No it 's four schools, four boys ' schools that are doing better than some of the girls ' schools\n<$A> Yeah yeah And those ones aren't, those ones there aren't far off it\n<$J?> No\n<$?> No\n<$A> So there 's a degree of overlap as well So sometimes the way people talk about it it seems that , girls are doing better than boys, the but there 's actually, it 's like any sort of spread I suppose, there is a degree of overlap That that 's not the very, that 's a very crude way of showing it But it shows some degree of overlap So it 's not simply a matter, all girls do better than all boys Uh there 's, uh there 's it 's a slightly more nuanced picture than than uh than that This is these are the same data for uh secondary schools in the same year Uh this is also the co-ed schools Uh the same principle, this is the scores for the boys, this is the scores for the, for the girls This time it 's the criterion, it 's the proportion uh passing five or more uh good GCSEs uh at year twelve Uh uh and this is again it 's the same for the uh co-ed schools What 's happening, what 's happening there\n<$J> The same picture Girls are outperforming boys virtually uh, virtually without exception\n<$A> Yeah There 's a few places where boys are doing better but there 's not that widely different from the, the centre line Uh the vast majority of the schools are on the other side of the line where the girls are tending to do better, and there 's a lot, there 's an awful lot more of the schools where the girls are doing markedly better than the uhm, than the boys Okay so in a sense that 's sort of, it 's it 's very similar to the sort of pattern that was found for the uh co-ed uh grammar schools Uhm, and then the uh single-sex secondary schools, again rank order uh from lowest to highest uh <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> for the boys ' schools and for the girls ' schools\n<$B> There 's not as much difference this time, in the low, much closer\n<$A> Yeah There 's there 's there 's quite a, there 's a reasonable degree of variation across them all   I  mean that fits in with the the high degree of variation we get with the secondary schools more generally Uhm the uh, the there 's much more overlap\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> In terms of the scores, so there 's there 's, some of the the boys ' schools are markedly lower than any of the girls ' schools but not that many of them, uh and there 's not that many of the girls ' schools are above all of the, the boys ' schools So it 's much more a case of overlap even though there 's sort of a broadly consistent pattern where the girls are on average clearly doing doing better Okay Now, so so what can we conclude from all of these things in relation to the uh the this sort of data on this uh issue about boys doing better or girls doing better What would be a a reasonable set of conclusions to take, take out of out of those data\n<$?> Well using exam results as you know raw data the girls seem to be coming out on average slightly better but there are exceptions to the rule and anybody <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> co-ed works that way I mean might turn round and say, look well my son or daughter 's going to a single-sex school because of the advantages of that over co-ed   and  look at it that way\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yeah yeah There is I think a widespread, well there appears to be a sort of a popular uh, there 's probably a good number of parents who do want their daughters to go to single-sex schools and their sons to go to co-ed schools which obviously is a mutually contradictory set of aspirations But uhm, uh uh partly because there is a belief that girls will do better in single-sex schools, uh whereas boys will be civilised in co-ed schools  Uh I don't know, I don't know about the latter bit of it but uh what 's happening in practice is that girls generally do better regardless So the evidence doesn't suggest that single-sex schools provide any performance uh any benefit, uhm partly because of this sort of pattern that uhm girls are doing uh doing better, doing better generally\n<$J?> Is there a comparison at all between boys in a single , you know boys in a single-sex and boys in a co-ed Rather than all pupils in a\n<$A> Uhm, I honestly can't remember The uhm most of the analysis on these things has tended to focus on on girls Uhm and I wouldn't want to say uh, my suspicion is that statistically it wouldn't make much of a difference", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8398f21d-803f-4f5a-9d49-13aa7812f195", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.241216+00:00"}
{"text": "<Law tutorial 2>\n\n\n<$A> So okay if you 've got a police car driving down the road and they drive into somebody, and they 're not on an emergency call, because that would take them into the uh reaches of of, but if they were just driving along, eating icecream and then they drive into somebody, they 've been negligent and they will be liable as would any other road-user Uhm, or if the roof falls in, in this, in this building, let 's say this is a school that falls on top of us, uh there would be liability on the part of the  the education authority There 's no problem that way It 's whenever they 're exercising statutory powers or performing a public service in a very obvious sense that there can be difficulties That 's what these cases are all essentially concerned with Are there, has anybody any questions about them before we start, or do you just want to go through them and, anybody any questions no Have got people generally got the the flavour of this from the, from the reading I mean in a sense it 's it 's it 's, this is more like administrative law to be perfectly honest with you than tort law, but the two overlap So, Anns and Merton Tell us about Anns and Merton Uhm, uhm, where 's Olivia   Olivia \n<$B>  Here  , it 's uhm, there was a building and there was a crack in the wall and it was because the foundations were only two foot, two foot something   deep  instead of three foot   deep  So uhm there was, there wasn't blame on the builder It was for the local authority because they didn't inspect it properly\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A> Right Now how did,  becau ,   you 're absolutely right, and there was legislation in question So the local authority had the power to introduce bye-laws to regulate building activities and so on and so forth Uhm how did Lord Wilberforce arrive at the conclusion that the local authority could be responsible, liable in negligence, in this case He introduced what Obviously what is too, again if you think about Anns and Merton, you 're you 're you 're on the uh opening up of liability again, so that 's what the courts are wanting, they 're wanting to impose liability anyway Lord Wilberforce introduced something very specific in relation to the exercise of statutory powers in the imposition of negligence liability\n<$B> Uhm he introduced the two-stage test, was it\n<$A> Well he introduced the two-stage test, that 's correct, in relation to the duty of care which was pitched towards you know, you have to give me a policy reason why we shouldn't impose liability But he also introduced something much more germane, to the question of of statutory, powers Anybody come across this Well, you, I mean, you should have come across it Uhm, he introduced a distinction, and said that liability could rest when, There was a distinction, The first word is like the police except you change the e to a y\n<$C> He 's talking about a policy operational thing\n<$A> Right the policy operational distinction Now tell us the context of the policy operational distinction, or tell us what that means\n<$C> Me\n<$A> Yeah <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$C> Uh, the public authority is, making policy decisions, uh ie deciding where money is going uh, prioritising things, uhm those decisions are not justiciable If I ever uhm in actual day-to-day operations, uhm I make, a bad decision, uh a negligent decision then that may be compensable\n<$A> Yeah Basically, a policy operational distinction was introduced by Lord Wilberforce where he said that,\n<$C> Was that not introduced in Home Office versus Dorset Yacht\n<$A> Well no the policy operational distinction term was used by Lord Wilberforce The the idea the idea of exercising your powers within, or liability whenever you 're exercising your lawful powers was the Home Office and Dorset Yacht approach And Lord Wilberforce emphasised that you can owe a duty of care whenever you 're making an operational decision Basically, I mean, the the proposition is that local authorities are given special powers by Parliament Parliament delegates powers downwards to local authorities Now prior to Anns and Merton, to refer back to the Home Office and Dorset Yacht, prior to that there, basically the position was, if you were exercising your powers lawfully in the sense that you were making a decision within the four corners of your legislative power, if you 're doing that, you don't owe duties of care, you can't be liable Because in a sense if you look at it in a very, okay it 's a public law perspective, but if you look at it you 're not acting unlawfully so how on earth, in a in a public law sense, so how on earth could you be liable in a private law sense It would create uh an inconsistency So Home Office and Dorset Yacht said if you 've been given powers by Parliament, the powers have four squares and as long as you stay within those four squares, or sorry four corners sorry, as long as you stay within the four corners of the square you don't owe duties of care Anns and Merton changed that in the sense that it said, okay, you 're given legislation by , uh legislative powers, uh by Parliament If you 're making a policy decision which is a decision about how many inspectors you 're going to employ, uh so and so, involves an allocation of resources question If you 're doing that, that 's not justiciable, it 's not for the courts, that 's fine, that 's not for court But he says once you 've made your decision, once you 've put in place your, uh decision-making machinery if you like, a day-to-day decision, taken within that framework, you can owe duties of care there, and he doesn't really talk, he doesn't talk about Home Office and Dorset Yacht and  acting outside your powers He just starts talking about day-to-day decisions Lord Wilberforce was trying to open up the parameters of liability So he said if you talk about policy matters, no duty of care, but if you 're talking about operational matters, then you can owe a duty of care Anns and Merton Does everybody understand that point from Anns and Merton, because it 's central to all subsequent case law, Yeah Right Anns and Merton Well then you tell us uhm Charles what X and Bedfordshire said, what X and Bedfordshire did, Or anybody if if you don't have it at hand, anybody tell us what X and Bedfordshire was the authority for And again if you think, Anns and Merton, the courts were trying to expand liability, X and Bedfordshire, the courts are very much trying to limit liability What did the courts say about when public authorities could be liable in respect of the exercise of statutory powers Okay the context of X and Bedfordshire is very different in the sense that you 're dealing with child abuse and education cases And we 're going to focus on the child abuse cases It 's a very different context from a building case Well what did X and Bedfordshire say about the exercise of statutory powers and when local authorities could be liable for the exercise of statutory powers Anybody X and Bedfordshire The courts were, they took a very restrictive approach Can anybody lay out the various steps because it brings together actually the Home Office and Dorset Yacht and Anns and Merton if you like because they return very much this, the logic of Home Office and Dorset Yacht in terms of whenever you 're acting within the parameters of your power X and Bedfordshire Anybody\n<$D> They said it must show the decision was outside their powers\n<$A> Right Yeah which, that comes back to Home Office and Dorset X and Bedfordshire, always think about this from the perspective that parliament has delegated powers downwards so it 's uh it 's given discretion to local authorities And in X and Bedfordshire cases, there 'd been discretions, statutory powers given to local authorities And what the House of Lords said in Bedfordshire was, first of all if you 're making a if you 're talking about policy decisions, and there is no easy distinction between a policy decision and an operational decision but, it 's very obvious that we 've a policy decision, the House of Lords said if a local authority is making a policy decision, it cannot owe a duty of care because those issues are non-justiciable, those are matters for the decision-makers themselves, for the political process with a small P So if you 're making a policy decision, an allocation of resources decision essentially, if you 're doing that, you do not owe a duty of care That 's not for the courts, none of the courts ' business The court then said beneath that, if you 're making what, in Lord Wilberforce 's terms would be operational, decision, I don't I can't remember if the House of Lords used that phrase in X and Bedfordshire, but beneath that, if you 're making what we will call an operational decision for the sake of argument, if you 're making an operational decision, the House of Lords says you do not owe a duty of care if you 're making an operational decision which is within the parameters of the power that has been given to you Is everybody following this yeah So you don't owe a duty of care in relation to lawful decisions in a public law sense because you 're staying within the parameters of your power, So in other words the House of Lords said you only owe a duty of care if you 're dealing with a matter which is not a policy matter, if it 's outside the parameters of your power and it says whenever we 're asking whatever if you acted outside the parameters of your power, have you acted in a way that is Wednesbury unreasonable, which is a public law test and a very very harsh test You basically have to act, act like a lunatic basically, the public authority has to have acted like a lunatic, effectively with all the formulations they talk about, a decision that 's outrageous, and it 's in defiance of logic and so on and so forth So if they 're going to owe any duty of care, not it it can't be a policy matter and you have to have acted Wednesbury unreasonable That then takes you outside the parameters of your power And at that stage the House of Lords then said you will, you will  you will have to satisfy what else And this is, Emma mentioned this at the start of the, class\n<$E> Foreseeability\n<$A> Uh well the third element of that test\n<$E> Just, fair and reasonable\n<$A> Right, fair just and reasonable The House of Lords was basically in X and Bedfordshire making it impossible to obtain damages against the local authority in, on the, in the facts and circumstance such as that Policy matter it 's not justiciable, uh if you 're acting within the parameters of your power in a non-policy matter, uh there 's no duty of care owed You have to be acting outside the parameters of your power, public law sense, Wednesbury unreasonable, very very difficult test to satisfy And then, you have to convince the court that it 's fair just and reasonable If you think about Anns and Merton and Lord Wilberforce 's two-stage formulation The formulation was something like about foreseeability and proximity, and are there policy reasons why we should not impose liability The fair just and reasonable test pitches that question <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and says, well you know you really have to convince us that there is a policy <unclear> several sylls </unclear>, very very very restrictive approach in <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> and a very very restrictive approach in X and Bedfordshire\n<$F> Sorry, what specifically have to be fair just and reasonable\n<$A> In all the circumstances of the case, you have to say to the court, in all the circumstances of the case, look at the context of this case, look at the statute, look at the purposes of the statute, look at how many agencies are involved, look at what the effect on us In the light of all of those circumstances we think it is fair and just and reasonable to impose a duty of care And the House of Lords said in these sort of cases, basically the House of Lords said, local authorities are really trying to do everybody a good turn here These are horrible nasty cases that we 're dealing with and they don't need liability added on as an extra consideration", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Workforce 1>\n\n\n<$A> So, in conclusion regarding human resource planning, let us consider these, <&Spanish> Numero uno </&Spanish>, we now have fifty-eight percent of the employed population in services, or service industry, What is a service industry One example is what I 'm doing today Education will be a service, so anybody employed in universities, RTCs, DITs, ABCs, XYZeds, would be counted to be in, the service industry except, Mr Walsh that, in your case, you 're a public employee so I would probably be categorised as a state employee Anyhow it 's a technicality Another service example would be, hotels, of course Some of you are actually in these You don't even know the industry you 're in, And that would contrast with people like Walsh 's Bread for example, or Medchem, who make things, so-called industry That 's quite a high proportion of, people airlines, often, except when they 're in the public employ, and they 're offering a service Secondly, the Irish labour market is  characterised by long-term unemployment, Thirdly, it is, give or take, about forty-eight percent unionised There 's a higher ratio, or a higher proportion of public service employees, are unionised than the private but, if we take the entire workforce we find something in the region of, five hundred thousand people, give or take, are in unions And out of a workforce of one point three million, given that three hundred thousand are unemployed that translates loosely into a, about a fifty fifty figure And finally, as us males are all  aware, far more females, have decided to abandon the shackles of previous cultural prisons and have decided to work, at least in the overt workforce, So what might some implications be Let 's begin with the, the female, for instance What are the implications of more females in the workforce If you were a human resource manager sitting at your desk You 've seen the headline, guru Walsh says more females in workforce And you say oh my God, what are the implications for <&French> moi </&French>, Ronan\n<$B> Uhm on a very practical aspect I suppose you, would have to hire more part-time staff if your female members become pregnant And you have to give them your their legal statutory right isn't it three months off isn't it\n<$A> Fourteen weeks to be   precise Yes, there 's  one practical implication In other words that someone could look at it and say, well females, some of them get pregnant, therefore I will need to replace them, they will be away for fourteen weeks plus holidays or whatever else therefore I need somebody to replace them in that time That 's one approach yes A second\n<$B>  Fourteen weeks aye, so  \n<$C> What about care facilities, you know,\n<$A> Exactly, what about creche care, or other onsite facilities which, perhaps the female workforce rather than the male workforce, might look for Don't know what the differences between that might be, but we can explore that off tape, okay That 's second Third\n<$?> <unclear> 7 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Why\n<$?> Because maybe <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> And why wouldn't the same flexi-approach apply to men with kids, Speaking as one,  I could do with it   Mm \n<$C>  Tradition  , probably\n<$A> Tradition, that the female is the carer But the tradition would say that the female stays at home, if she 's got the kid, whereas the male goes to work Why don't we instead make, have males and females come into work but let 's be more flexible about them, But yes it 's a good point taken from previous examples in literature And finally the B Com 'd framed analyst says, cos they 've been trained to think analytically and objectively, it mightn't make any difference Let 's just see Let 's weigh up all these possibilities Let 's consider the trends And let 's take it from there Because don't forget as, one part of your training suggests which stresses the objective and the analytical and the rational, nothing should surprise you All females in the workforce Hey, all males Fifty fifty Sixty forty, either way, you don't care You 're a trained manager You 'll do it no problem Get out the case analysis, <unclear> several sylls </unclear> suggestions go through it, boom boom, report, manager 's desk, ten o'clock Wednesday morning You 're in real trouble if someone asks you for  or for Friday morning at ten o'clock cos you 're so used to putting them in on Wednesday at ten o'clock Anyway, So that 's one set of implications Number two <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> might be a set of implications concerning unionisation, Well Mr Walsh apart from the fact that as we 're trained rational managers there mightn't be any, By comparison with our competitor countries ie the United States we 've fifteen percent  or unionised, There may be, given the significant differences, something to take into account In other words there may be somebody representing the workforce, in the worksite, that you 've to deal with You as representative of management, they as representative of employees And if you 've done collective bargaining type situations or if you 've negotiated with one person on behalf of a group then you 're aware of the situation I saw Ciaran standing up here last week as some kind of class rep, correct or, no, Situation announcing him, a marketing type thing we 're aware of the class rep type of thing What if the class rep becomes the shop steward, or whatever or the whatever in future, or is the the equivalent So however there is some other managerial implications for unionisation One is collective bargaining, ie that you don't negotiate with every individual in the workforce you  negotiate with one, on their behalf Second, third, and fourth Good, you 'll think of something I presume by May Long-term unemployment, is something we hear an awful lot about What are the HR implications, that might arise from having a large number of people, who are long-term unemployed,\n<$D> They may become unemployable\n<$A> Exactly There may be a certain set of skills out there that you can't do an awful lot with, and that however you 're put under pressure to do something about in your local area for instance if you 're a large employer, by TDs politicians governments and so on who say let 's go for jobs Our aim in tourism this year I see, or for nineteen ninety-three ninety-four is thirty five thousand jobs, And then the idea is that the industry fails if it only gets thirty four thousand nine hundred and ninety nine, or something Rather than starting off with saying, the industry really needs innovative products, say something that Manor House Hotel isn't producing for instance uhm,  or, a dynamic approach which, if it produces growth in the industry will lead to jobs, maybe thirty five thousand, maybe seventy five thousand, who knows, and so on And finally the fact that, almost six in ten of the workers, in this, Emerald Isle are in services rather than industry or in the public sector suggests that, because traditionally services are characterised by, rapid turnover, lots of small operations, lots of part-time and contract work, that, a number of significant HR implications apply Good so moving right along Dineen nineteen eighty-seven, has suggested in his wisdom, that, what we 're seeing is, the rise of atypical unemployment patterns The fundamental implication of these types of, general things that we 've talked about, such as services  services unemployment unionisation and so on, female, an increase by female participation in the labour force, can be summarised, he says, in one thing, that all of this change is producing, in terms of the labour, force, a set of atypical employment patterns And he, mentions four, Firstly there 's been an increase in part-time employment, Secondly, a huge increase in temporary or casual work, Thirdly he can point to a rise in self employment, I think that was more true of the time he was writing, than it is today necessarily And finally, in terms of being an explosion in government and community schemes, of one which great debate at the moment is whether to pay, double allowances to those on SES schemes on the north side versus the south side of the city Are you aware of that debate on your local radio station Yes Yes Yes they are  They they told me to say Okay, so let 's look at these There 's been the criticism, Mr Walsh, that in fact, given macro changes to competitive, situation to the environment, given the single European market, given more macro things outside of the little island we live on, in fact, these are not atypical employment patterns any more They may have been, even as lately as six years ago when Mr Dineen, excuse me Mr Dineen did his research However in fact they are today, increasingly a dominant, element, in the working landscape, and therefore a dominant, trend for HR specialists, managers generally and organisations to take account of In other words that it is now perhaps, certainly among recent graduates, atypical, not to have a temporary, or contract position In fact what would be, atypical would be to have a permanent job Pensionable employment and so on And I 've mentioned before Handy 's, suggestion that there are different forms of time now Instead of looking at this in terms of the, uh the impact it 's having on the labour force he says let 's have,  let 's look at it on the impact it 's having on individuals We all have different times to give to employers, full-time time, temporary-time, gift-time that we give to organisations voluntary societies and so on, and so on And  he looks at it in a very different way in his book The Age of Unreason, for those of you who want to look at that So I think we would agree, yes, that these things are happening We can all see around, we 've had the example in the Irish university system for instance, that a majority of teaching positions are now filled by contract staff, not by permanent people That 's just one example, and we can probably think of members of our own families, or other friends who are in these types of situation The question is, do we agree or not that these are atypical Is it a cyclical thing that we 're going through, that these are, somewhat dominant now, and once everything gets back together again we go back to the permanent long-term type of situation, Deborah\n<$E> Uhm we go back to the permanent uhm <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Why\n<$E> Because uhm <unclear> 15 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Like basketball shoes, fast food and so on Alright so that 's that 's one interpretation, which I think is somewhat accurate That there 's a trend out there that we 're copying or somewhat kind of five years behind or three years behind or whatever and, we just latch on, Anybody else with a comment,\n<$F> The companies as well It 's a lot easier you know they don't have to worry about redundancy packages like that if <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Yes\n<$F> And if your term contract is up like you know <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> You 're gone Yeah And the company from a cost point of view would be very interested in that obviously But a company might also from a cost point of view be interested in renting accommodation rather than buying, uh leasing cars, you know they 're, if we take the Atlantic extension, there are a number of things we could do economically that would uh be more efficient However, as we know the reason we try and lock in assets, fixed or human, is because of, commitment, involvement We don't get the same type of, rapport with, temporary people as we might get with long-term At least that 's one argument But again that 's that 's a second valid point", "subdomain":

{"text": "<Workforce 2>\n\n\n<$A> Thirdly, it identifies the human resource department as a source of expert knowledge in the firm, There is, now somebody on board who can tell us about, how we 're planning and what we 're doing Who is somebody, who can do succession planning who can use the computer models that exist and so on, which you 've become  acquainted with depending on the, HR department you join, should you pursue that career, Cathy Monks, mentioned Sean Tyson here, four weeks ago she was here And Sean Tyson has three models of the human resource function One is the clerk of works, starting with at the bottom, where the clerk is given the plans and has a very rudimentary elementary, plan interpretation role Followed by the engineer,  who has more of a discretionary role, in interpreting plans, And finally the architect mode, according to Tyson, who would be, if you like, the most, strategic type of role, to use a building or construction analogy, given that architects work with blank sheets of paper and somebody 's idea of how the school, prison, university, factory should look In other words Tyson says that in being given the importance of strategic decision-making  and the different levels of strategic  decision-making that exist, in any organisation, depending on how involved the human resources person is, determines, their influence in the organisation, and the mode of operation they 're capable of So many Irish organisations, clearly do not have architects in their HR function, do not have somebody who can lay the organisation out in front of them as a series of blueprints or charts and say how would we like this organisation to look, to design elements of the organisation, to develop and grow people through HR strategies They are the more likely instead to have the plan decided, at a higher level than HR then given to the HR person to implement It 's like the building site which this building has been part of, for perhaps too long In other words, the engineer wasn't involved necessarily in the design of the building but he, takes some critical decisions in the course of its building The clerk of works is a more lowly person again, who may reports to the engineer and is responsible for, one small section of the wall going up straight or something, or for the materials arriving on time, Ormond brick from Kilkenny or whoever, that they arrived, that they sent in the four thousand bricks that they said they would they were all brown they weren't cracked, or whatever As you can see very, uh low level in terms of its strategic nature And that I think is a useful model That 's what Cathy Monks was referring to when she was here from DCU four or five weeks ago Anyhow the, more complicated, the more complex the workforce planning operation then the more it fits with the architect mode of operation, Fifthly there is the notion that, in some way if we plan for our workforce we are engaged in change management Cos why would we plan if we didn't need some change to happen or we  we didn't expect some change Contentious point maybe, Sixth, there is this very tiny quote which you can't see so I 'll call it out, This is from Gunnigle and Flood nineteen, ninety, if you want to write that down Gunnigle and Flood G U double-N I G L E, G U N N I G L E Gunnigle and Flood, Paddy Gunnigle and Patrick Flood, and they say that effective manpower planning, as you can guess why I 've called it workforce planning Effective manpower planning in their terms is a prerequisite, in their opinion to the successful execution of related personnel activities, In other words there 's a whole set of activities undertaken by the personnel function, which this, operation this, function, workforce planning precedes And unless you have some clear plan as to where you 're going, then what you are likely to find in your functional personnel activity is a lot of activity, not really knowing its mm mm from its elbow And if we hadn't a tape I 'd have said arse for that , you know what I mean And you know what I mean, okay good do you have all that That 's Gunnigle and Flood G U N N I G L E and Flood nineteen ninety, <&French> Excellent </&French> Let us at this stage take uhm the next, show and tell, so that we can have different voices on the tape If you 're interested in that we 're going to have some, and these are  the next team up I I I I know are are chosen particularly, for their uh unique accentual variations Who 's next, Here we go right, First up, let 's do it, \n<$B> Uhm our article is taken from Personnel Management and it 's called Managing Healthily How an , an NHS region is promoting change The NHS in Britain is considered to be inefficient, top heavy, with administration grossly underfunded, and not serving the population all that well On the other hand measures to introduce a modern management culture are viewed with suspicion They are seen as wasteful and a diversion of  resources, which could be better spent directly on patient care One of the problems with the NHS is that there is no neat link between general management and professional teams, ie the doctors, who 're actually responsible for seventy percent of the expenditure, within the hospital The hospitals are hospitals are in need of an, cohesive workforce, all pulling in the same direction and now we 're going to explain the new management techniques that they, introduced to achieve this\n<$C> And the NHS has had to introduce uhm major strategic shifts to cope with uhm changes in the health system And in the health system in Britain now there 's more concentration on long-term patients, long-term care for patients and also community care, so they 've had to change their modes of control and control to cope with this And also they 're changing uhm, they 're changing the way uhm management is uhm, they 're changing the way management is introduced Now they 're bringing in professionals into the management uhm roles rather than just administrative people They 're bringing in nurses and doctors uhm who are passing on from their uhm jobs on the wards into the  more administrative roles And they have planned uhm career paths to make this a structured uhm way into the  they 're they 're making a formal bridge from the, role in the hospital to the administrative role\n<$D> Uhm basically the the national health service in England is in very bad shape just like the health service, in Ireland That 's a bit of an understatement Uhm, so they decided that they needed uh major strategic shifts uh because technology was what was driving change within the organisation Uh because of technology they saw the role of the hospital you know narrowing, uh to the  to as Joanne said to now community care and very specialised services So they felt that uhm as a result of this that the actual way that management is made up and namely of that of the  the four strategic components that of the buyers, the suppliers, and the professional people themselves, both private and and public sector hospitals that uhm, the they will have to encourage doctors uh and nurses to get involved in the managerial aspect of the hospital and in running it So they decided that education was the best uh vehicle to to bring about this change So they brought about an MBA programme in Durham University whereby each year they 're going to send a hundred uhm members of staff, of which fifty percent will be women, to do a two-year MBA programme And hopefully they 're looking for these uh MBA people to be the catalysts for change, to bring about a new culture, uh which will encourage uh nurses and doctors to, you know be more  proactive uh as regards strategy in the managerial level of the NHS service\n<$E> I 'm just going to fill you in on the MBA foundation programme Uhm it looks at the knowledge and competence in the areas such as marketing, HR management and accounting A series of electives provide the opportunity for students ' individual managerial interests to be followed The programme also provides an opportunity for research into health aspects However, by itself this MBA programme cannot bring about cultural change required by NHS, but it will bring modern manager skills, fresh thinking and innovation It will challenge the system to produce a change For the executive level management which lacks clear direction, they propose a school of excellence, where senior managers could rapidly develop the leadership skills required to effect the major changes in progress Management in the health service has improved significantly with the implementation of this train of thought, but if it is to continue to be effective, it requires the NHS to develop a management structure with certain sufficient flexibility for the new purchasing managers to experiment and develop the provision of healthcare, in a way that satisfies the needs of particular communities\n<$A> Very good Thank-you And you could call moving into the foyer at uh half two in the course of the ball at Jury 's a strategic shift, but that would be,  something for us <unclear> several sylls </unclear> The issue of to as to whether or not a group of MBA students, or MBA graduates can come back into an organisation and produce strategic change is an interesting one What might the reaction of people be to an MBA person who 's come back in, What 's a likely personal reaction,\n\n<$A> Exactly Some kind of hostility, it 's what you 're trying to say, isn't it Good Uh the issue of what you know that makes you somewhat different or better to the rest of us Why should you be the vehicle for change You 're such a doodah anyway, type thing Like the reaction you 're going to get when you join organisations perhaps as the first graduate to be taken on Blarney Woollen Mills that successful group for instance took on its first graduate, four years ago, who had taken HR in her final year from Professor Walsh, who left after a year, because there was a lot of hostility to graduates in that organisation, just to mention one small case example They 've since changed a little As we know there was a lot of tension in that organisation, exemplified by the retirement of its or the resignation of its present or previous Chief Executive, the debate being whether or not they should move on this line of professional managers ie graduates, or not Which was actually the decision, except that the person who walked in there as the first graduate didn't know that She just thought this was great being hired She was actually kind of the meat in the sandwich quite a lot So that 's an interesting point as to whether or not these people can go away on an external exchange programme and come back in and be, the change agents In other words should change start within, and use these people as well, rather than rely completely on the MBA programme, to drive change Interesting question and good example Uh Maiden Airways do we have, an opportunity <&French> Merci </&French>", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9db39a36-dfb0-4aa7-833a-6772d7740214", "added":

{"text": "<Industrial policy 1>\n\n\n<$A> Uh question three on on Michaelmas term of last year just as a matter of interest there, was uhm, or question four was, evaluate the impact of foreign firms with respect to employment in industrial regions Now the last day we did the first, uhm we did the questions prior to that about the cause of regional inequalities and whether or not there was a case for regional intervention and uhm, we did some stuff on uhm capital bias and regional bias but you know I think I want to focus on this business of the performance uh of foreign firms and the impact of it Uh now, who will start the ball rolling Uhm, John what about yourself I know you have the figures there in front of you But if I put up the figures first of all, I can put the figures on the slide, uhm, and you 'll have a, an impression of them for those of you who haven't got it there The first slide basically shows uhm <unclear> several words </unclear>  Is it visible at all there\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Is that okay Reasonably okay You have the handout somewhere You should have the handout down in your notes if you haven't got it there Basically what slide number one is showing is the distribution of both indigenous and foreign firms in Ireland Really it 's probably easiest to focus on the summary at the bottom of the page Uh you recall that we divided the country into western periphery and so-called eastern core, Uh the western periphery being the sort of half-way down the the centre of the map which you have also, and the eastern core being the northeast the, the uhm southeast Now I think you can use these figures here to answer that question about the impact of foreign firms with respect first of all to employment anyway So Tom do you want to start the ball rolling How, how would you tackle that\n<$C> Uhm, well to start with you 'd have to agree with the fact <unclear> several sylls </unclear> agree with anything You 'd have to state the fact that foreign firms as it were create more jobs <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and have consistently done so from nineteen seventy-three to eighty-nine and you could back it up with figures that you 've given us two on the two tables Uhm, in comparing the foremost indigenous with foreign firms you could say that the Irish firms as a rule have lost out But you could counteract that, counteract that by saying the uhm grant system the grant scheme is geared more for foreign industries, multinationals than it is for indigenous industries as a rule Any  indigenous industries that exist tend to have been <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> more traditional They were older and as a result they have lost out through technology and time\n<$A> Yeah\n<$C> And consequentially they 've they 've had to <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>\n<$A> Right But if you were answering the question now would you be more specific, could you, would you be able to be more specific about it I don't imagine you 'll remember all, all the figures but would you be able to remember any particular figures from the table Supposing you 're chatting your friend in the buttery this evening or trying to impress your girlfriend about uhm your knowledge, trying to set up an alliance for the future, you 'd like to explain to her that you know so much about uh industrial policy and the impact of it now uhm\n<$C> Well for the foreign firms\n<$A> More detail more specific\n<$C> Right foreign firms just to take the total here have a gain of basically sixty-two thousand jobs in the region of between seventy-three and eighty, and they 've made a loss of twenty-seven thousand In comparison the Irish firms made a gain of eighty thousand and lost seventy-two thousand so there 's a net change in value there of nine\n<$A> Are these these ones here Is that what you 're talking about\n<$C> I 'm talking about the seventy-three to eighty\n<$A> Seventy-three to eighty okay Gains and losses Yeah That one there\n<$C> Okay yes\n<$A> The net change\n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> No they 're the Irish\n<$C> Right\n<$A> And the foreigners, there is a gain\n<$C> So it 's three times as much The foreigners are basically creating three times as many jobs\n<$A> Okay\n<$C> In the same period in nineteen seventy-three to eighty when granted there was, the economic times during seventy-three to eighty were really poor\n<$A> Okay right So you 're, that 's the  that 's the unusually good time\n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> Does uhm, Any any comments on that, Jamie\n<$D> I 'd be pretty much in full agreement with that one Yeah <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Are you familiar with that data\n<$D> I am familiar with the data Yeah\n<$A> Well would you care to comment on the later period   Or any \n<$D>  The uh eighty-two  \n<$A> There for eighty-one now to   eighty-nine \n<$D>  Eighty-nine   right Well in that period we can clearly see that there 's a, a net change in uh Irish firms There 's a loss of uhm thirty-seven thousand jobs, a net net loss, whereas with the foreign firms there has been a net gain of a hundred and seventy-nine thousand\n<$A> Hold on now\n<$D> Sorry\n\n<$E> You 've lost me\n\n<$A> There 's something wrong there\n<$E> No Just it it is just uh turn this thing out, yeah <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Other way Derek  That 's better\n<$A> Okay sorry about that\n<$D> And we can see that overall there 's been a net loss for Irish firms of uhm thirty-seven thousand jobs in the period whereas the uhm foreign firms only lost three thousand jobs So obviously they fared relatively better so it 's been a difficult period as a whole The foreign firms due to you know better competitors and whatnot have succeeded Not succeeded, have fared better in terms of losing less jobs in what was obviously a difficult period\n<$A> Okay\n<$D> I just think the eighty-six <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the amount of jobs <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the eighty-six <unclear> several sylls </unclear> diversified the uhm grant structure, you know, which I think would hit Irish firms more so than the multinationals because they will have the capital anyway <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Yeah Is there anything else though, you 're talking about there the actual volume of numbers now What about this business of uh regional dispersal Would anybody care to comment on that, Have the multinationals an impact in dispersing jobs to certain regions Somebody else somebody else from the people who spoke on that, Who 's going to comment on that Young ladies present\n<$F> Just that the multinationals <unclear> several sylls </unclear> industry throughout Ireland <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Okay be more specific now\n<$F> Uhm,\n<$A> Can you use the data to, to you know be a bit more explicit than saying that multinationals you know dispersed more widely\n<$F> Uhm, uh, well three had uh three <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Go to table eight three Go to table eight three and four They 're the two best tables I think\n<$F> Eight three and four\n<$A> You should be able to draw conclusions about the dispersal from those and look perhaps at the uhm, at the summary, down at the bottom, the summary of the western periphery and the eastern core\n<$F> Here\n<$A> Yeah\n<$F> So you 're saying there 's a net change of, of minus ten thousand jobs, Irish jobs, <unclear> several sylls </unclear> in the western core and then minus twenty-seven thousand in the east\n<$A> And you and you go to table eight three first\n<$F> Yeah\n<$A>  Are you picking up the sound of the voices do you think sufficiently\n<$G>  Yes, thanks \n<$F> Go to table eight three first and what would your conclusion be now\n<$F> Uhm\n<$A> I 'm trying to get you to be more specific about the regional dispersal of these jobs\n<$F> Uh well if you 're looking, if the policy aim was to get them to disperse into the western region, Irish firms have a net increase of six thousand two hundred and ten jobs\n<$A> Right\n<$F> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Right\n<$F> Foreign firms have net change of eighteen thousand\n<$A> Correct So the foreign firms really would appear to have had a much greater uh dispersal into the regions\n<$F> Yeah\n<$A> And even, what about the eastern core then\n<$F> Uhm the eastern core from Irish firms had an increase of four thousand nine hundred and foreign firms twenty thousand\n<$A> Yeah so they are three times better in all parts of the country really And the same really that, this is really confirming what Tom said earlier really that, however you assess them they seem, whether it 's in terms of jobs themselves or in terms of regional dispersal, they would appear to be doing much better than the Irish firms Take the eighty-one to eighty-nine period Would somebody else comment on that now Eighty-one to eighty-nine period uhm,  This is eighty-one to eighty-nine now, I don't, I think you 're going to have to really study these figures in a bit more detail Because if you 're to answer that sort of question, you, it 's not enough to simply say well look foreign firms had an enormous impact and they they dispersed jobs into the regions That 's not enough really You have to be much more specific and and give precise evidence for your position\n<$D> Just as a matter of interest in an exam situation I always feel that <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> No you won't have tables but I mean there are, there 's a small amount of key elements that you should be able to take out of the table I think, to to bolster up your position\n<$D> Would it be necessary to actually quote figures or would it just be more of a a general ideas of proportions you know Like if we were saying say, there would you have to quote say the exact figures relating to how many people foreign firms uh were employing on the eastern seaboard or would it just be better to say the uhm that the the Irish firms employ twice as many as the foreign firms or would you actually be looking for figures\n<$A> Uhm well I think it would help It would help to give some sort, I mean twice as many could be three as opposed to one and a half you know It would be useful to have some indication of\n<$D> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Of the total numbers Now the total numbers are not that difficult it seems to me there\n<$D> Yeah I mean this is early on in Michaelmas term right With respect, the Regional Industrial Policy exams in the summer are only two exams in less than five days ' time So the idea of studying these figures for summer\n<$A> Yeah\n<$D> It 's a bit\n<$A> Oh it 's a long way ahead\n<$D> Cos it 's a long way ahead\n<$D> You 'll have to forgive our lack of acuity at the moment you know Relatively speaking at the moment our concentration <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Well you 're on to other things at the moment\n\n<$A> I know and I assume you 're doing your forty hours ' a week study at this stage\n<$D> At the very minimum yeah\n\n<$A> See Jeff is a, Jeff is, a, he and I you know have often tutored together and we we always said to students twenty hours a week of lectures and classes and twenty hours of study and and serious study Not talking to girls or boys during these periods What are you doing at the moment Are you doing,\n<$D> We 've uh MIS on uh Monday <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Okay well then I 'm being entirely miserable and I 'm sorry uh to to introduce this uhm this detailed data No okay well we needn't, obviously I don't expect at this stage that you would but I think, I 'm trying to make the point though that, if you 're going to adopt a position uh you really do need data, and at least in the dim and distant future you will have to\n<$H> We we know the trends at the moment and then like a few days before the exam we well we can sort of actually learn the figures <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$D> So is it is it  a case of where like where trends gets you kind of a low two two whereas you know the numbers you get a two one, like that \n\n<$A> No At the end of the day I 'm not very interested in examinations to be honest with you And neither am I interested in indoctrinating you to particular points that you, I suppose I 'm trying to raise consciousness about uhm the issues and at the end of the day I have said many many times now so far, that you are the people who must draw the judgements The exam I mean, I don't think the exams are are important really, Uhm, they are well they are important from your point of view I suppose they are But, the vast majority of people doing uhm Regional Industrial Policy do relatively well, I think So I don't think that should be the focus of your attention Rather it 's the material and whether you can be interested in it and whether you can relate to it, whether eventually perhaps you can influence change Maybe that 's the really important issue It 's a matter of being fairly critical of it and rather than making a very general statement to say well you know foreign companies are Because there is a perception that foreign firms are bad news I 've, I 've had that uh feeling myself for many years that well, all these multinationals are really bad news They come into Ireland and other countries, especially less developed countries, and they uhm they milk the place of its of its grants and so on and its tax incentives and then when the going gets rough they leave But when I, I did research on this thing and that that those tables I 've given you are based on some of that research, uh I did have to change my mind and at least I had to recognise that multinationals were you know creating quite a lot of jobs", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<Industrial policy 2>\n\n\n<$A> Would you have any information to support the view that uhm multinationals essentially employ uh those good employees whereas uhm the Irish firms would have you know middle management and top management would be Irish whereas with the multinationals it would be essentially foreigners who control the upper echelons <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$B> Well there isn't a great deal of of evidence but there is one article which is on your reading list which does help a little, and in fact I showed the slide at one of the sessions recently, and that article is uhm Kelly, on Irish electronics firms in the book uhm Perspectives on Irish Industry by Jim Fitzpatrick And there 's one table in that uhm book which tries to answer that question And it seems to show that uhm multinationals do have a very high proportion of uhm what I think he calls production workers uhm in comparison with other countries, and uh a very low proportion in what he calls management and professional categories So but, you know that 's the only evidence I have now Now the other evidence that it is available is of course the uhm publications like the Telesis Report in the early nineteen eighties, was very strong on that particular issue and uh O'Malley 's book which you hopefully know about or heard about at this stage Uh there 's a few chapters in that uh where he quotes fairly widely from the Telesis Report, and the basic conclusion reached is that uhm most multinational firms, uh although they may appear to be high-tech industries, in fact employ large proportions of semi-skilled or unskilled workers\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> So that is coming through, and I  it is a problem\n<$C> Is that not good I mean I I thought that we needed those jobs They 're the industrial jobs that went You know they 're the textiles and the, the millions of jobs that went or whatever in the fifties when we lost out to say Taiwan and people who were producing linen  manufactured goods very cheaply, so we needed those skills to try and \n<$B> Ah yes You can't say no to them but it it is one of, you know it 's, obviously you do Do and there are lots of people who are employed in manufacturing who would not be retrainable overnight I mean one has to recognise that, that if you lost uh whatever the number we 're talking about is roughly, two hundred and ten thousand people employed in manufacturing today, now if they were made redundant now and let 's assume that eighty to ninety per cent are in relatively semi-skilled unskilled posts, it 'd be a large proportion, if they were made redundant tomorrow morning what on earth would one do So you know you can argue that well, semi-skilled or unskilled posts are better than no posts   But it 's  one of the arguments against multinationals that they don't provide the sort of skilled posts that are arguably needed\n<$A>  But would you would you   \n<$A> Would you also mention the lack of linkage now the uhm repatriation <unclear> several sylls </unclear> foreign firms\n<$B> I think that the uhm the linkages thing is important and is relevant to the question  ,  even though it wasn't directly asked in the question was it\n<$A>  Would you not say  \n<$A> You want to incorporate everything though don't you\n<$B> I know\n\n<$B> Yeah there are advantages and disadvantages obviously The multinationals are repatriating a fair amount of the profits alright That said we 've a major problem But on the other hand uhm, is that an argument for getting rid of them altogether   Once , once upon a time I suppose I thought it was an argument but I don't any more\n<$A>  No  \n<$A> No no of course not what I 'm saying like, relative to Irish firms it 's more desirable to have an Irish firm employing a thousand people than say a similar foreign firm Is that not what you 'd say\n<$D> In the short term but in the long term when you look at the success of foreign firms you have to say that foreign firms probably were never as successful, and those jobs are probably more secure So that as opposed to getting what a thousand Irish getting a thousand Irish jobs as opposed to a thousand foreignary jobs, they 're probably more secure in the long term\n<$B> Yeah it 's a very difficult issue What is happening in the last few years, it is not entirely obvious, it 's not at all obvious in fact from the figures you have but it seems that really since Spain and Portugal joined the European Community, which was relatively recent in eighty-six wasn't it, that the number of multinationals coming in on an annual basis does not, does appear to have dropped, so that uh they 're not coming in as rapidly now because of this extra competition from other peripheral, desperate, if you like, countries\n<$A> Does Scotland not have a similar policy did someone say\n<$B> And then Eastern Germany now if you like\n<$A> What 's, and Eastern Europe 's going to once they, when they join I mean that 's going to get possibly very bad\n<$B> So, well that 's the point, so that to put all one 's eggs into the multinational basket probably would be misguided now, and and it does appear that the IDA and the government are saying look at, multinationals have a role but Irish indigenous firms we 've really got to get them out of the dreadful dregs that we 're in\n<$A> Could one not argue also that uhm the net losers in terms of competition for attracting multinational firms is the actual, the governments at the end of the day because if each government is competing to get a single multinational firm they 'll have more attractive more lucrative offers in terms of say given factors and stuff you know The gain is the multinationals who at the end of the day can leave just as quickly as they came and the losers are the Irish government\n<$B> There 's a very serious issue there Enormous sums of money are being paid to attract them in really, and enormous competition between Scotland and Ireland, England and Ireland uhm, France and Ireland Portugal They they 're just out there bidding, effectively You probably recall occasions when, was it Reynolds or was it Bertie Ahern or some of these guys went off to the States you know\n\n<$B> Now anybody who has, what about yourself Have you, have you any any comment at all on this the multi, we we 're talking about the performance of multinational firms\n<$E> Yeah uh\n<$B> And so we 've talked about employment, we 've talked about regional dispersal Linkages, I 'd like to come back on linkages but just before we do, anything you want to add Or contradict\n<$E> Actually I was just wondering uhm I told you I was reading about this uhm EC legislation whereby EC countries uh are bound uh and they quote that thing about Digital Uh uh I don't know if this is true now or not that Irish and say Scotland at the time it said what they could offer multinational companies coming in wasn't a question because obviously the British government could have offered much more incentives to Digital than we could have and uhm I thought the EEC asked for those other you know\n<$B> You 're quite right Does anybody want to take on that question\n<$A> Well certainly there 's a limit to what the IDA IDA are, have been able to offer Isn't that right There 's only so far they can go\n<$B> Well the Irish legislation says a maximum of twenty-five per cent, I 'll be showing you some of the stuff today But does anybody His specific point is that the European Community has uhm, you called it legislation, which limits Anybody want to comment on that no Now we haven't covered it of course well I haven't covered it Well basically just a quick, I 'll try to give you a quick answer Uh European Community has what it calls Competition Policy The competition is a critical element It is a critical philosophy Uh free trade, free movement of capital and labour, free movement of services No tariffs, no quotas, all, you know, that is the theory behind the whole idea of the European Union and all these countries are together and there 's supposed to be free movement between the lot of them No barriers And so competition is the critical issue, and uh it 's very , very specifically written into the original European Community Treaty, nineteen fifty-six fifty-seven Uh now at the same time as that , it 's a philosophy basically of the market, from market rules they say, and it 's a market economy and the European Commission therefore set up a range of directorates and one of the most crucial of all directorates is the competition directorate Uh DG, is it DG six or G There there 's twenty-three of them But anyway the competition directorate, I can't remember the precise number of it, uh is constantly looking around for what they call unfair competition And it 's directly relevant to what we 're talking about really and very the question is very important They are going, they 're looking constantly at the incentive packages of all European countries, and they 're saying on a regular basis look at, this is out of order And that is precisely what they said to us in relation to the export profits tax release scheme which we had operated in this country from fifty-six, uh in effect up to ninety-one There were a number of minor changes in the early eighties but let 's for simplicity 's sake, from fifty-six to ninety-one and by ninety-one we were ordered effectively by the European Commission to phase it out because it represented unfair competition and it was contrary to the the fundamental competition policy of the European Community Now the difficulty of course is that practically every European country, has a regional policy and if you think about it, a regional policy which attempts to, you know the sixty per cent grant, which attempts to move work from one area to another, discriminates in favour of one area rather than another, is obviously in direct conflict with competition policy So there 's a sort of a, and the European Community accepts that regional policy is a critical element So they wrote into the Treaty in fifty-six what they call derogations They said well in cases where there are massive levels of unemployment in a region we will be prepared to allow uhm special incentives provided, they have another qualification, provided it does not interfere with the market mechanism So it 's always uh there 's always this knife edge and this question mark surrounding whether, to try to answer your question, whether uhm the European Community can allow all these special incentives But in our case they 've abolished one, and they 're always looking at it In the British case for example they abolished the regional employment premium which was giving special, in the nineteen sixties and right through into the nineteen seventies the British were giving special employment incentives in a number of northern regions of England, and the European Commission ruled at that time that it was anti-competition or anti-competitive and so therefore they effectively said Get rid of it And the British had to get rid of it So that, I mean European policy is actually quite important and I 'm going to be , and then when we come back I 'll be dealing with it in a few sessions", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source":

Yeah\n<$A> Can they ask, okay Uhm, right Okay the normal questions that come up uh for Old English first year Okay, uhm the course is split in two Okay there 's, there 's Beowulf and everything else Okay Everything else, that is the elegies They enlighten you, enlighten you on Beowulf Okay, uh they 're supposed to help you with, in your understanding of Beowulf But the main thing is Beowulf   Okay  So if you haven't read Beowulf by Thursday, yeah, you can forget about doing the question really\n<$C>  Right  \n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> Okay Uhm now We can forget about doing the Old English question Uhm, having said that, in Beowulf, the possible questions that could come up are uhm, digressions in Beowulf, the digressions in Beowulf Discuss the role of women in Beowulf, uh, uh What part or what role do the monsters play in Beowulf, uh I don't think you 'll get a question on landscape \n<$?> No\n<$B> Oh\n<$A>  You all of a sudden, oh no <&French> Zut </&French> Uhm that 's one thing I I don't think so Uhm that would be nice, 'twould be very nice, it 'd be very nice for me, it 'd be very nice for you But uhm unfortunately that that may not come up\n<$D> And we will definitely be asked on Beowulf will we \n<$A> Oh yeah That 's, that 's a cert\n<$D> Won't be just the, like say, The Wanderer or something like that we 'd be asked <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Unless he goes

sorry, is to uh go to the offprints in the English department   Okay  The offprints today are open between half four and half six Okay And tomorrow they 're open between half two and four Okay Uhm and you ask for a First Arts Old English file Okay or yeah, Professor O'Rahilly 's file for first year And uh\n<$?>  Okay  \n\n<$A> Uhm, okay, uh, okay, offprints Uh you 'll find many if not all of the  of the things that are on your booklist, booklist, okay, both sides, uhm, in the offprints Uh myself and Daphne 've actually made five copies of each, so uh we 're we 're catering for demand Hopefully it will be <unclear> several sylls </unclear> And the way it works is, you ask for the file, you go through it, you pick out what you want And it 's two pounds per folder Okay, sorry two pounds per uhm, per offprint, okay it 's a deposit You get it back So in other words if you 've if you 've not enough money, if you 've enough money for one, you you you get it out, you run to the your nearest

eight two nine point three, Beowulf, that 's the Beowulf section There may not be too much there but uh whatever is there Uhm  now the question to do with Christianity in Beowulf, uh, you know about uh the the problems about a Christian interpretation of Beowulf Uhm, now, in the Beowulf section, uh books to look out for, I mean the general editions okay, the text is in Old English Don't worry about that It 's the introduction you 're looking for, okay, introduction Now there 's about three or four different  uh editions of Beowulf Okay one is by a guy called R W Chambers Okay Chambers It 's a blue one, it 's thick And it 's actually, that 's actually the introduction to the book itself, to the poem itself Okay Chambers Uhm Wrenn is another one W R E N N Wrenn Okay C L Wrenn okay Uhm third one, it 's a paperback book, it 's new There 's only one copy, I was using it today  It 's called, it 's called Beowulf obviously and it 's by a guy called Chickering, okay C H I C K E R I N G

think I was No I wasn't\n<$?> I was there like and I don't know\n<$C> I got a photocopy yesterday\n<$D> No you see what happened was cos she was flying through the stuff and   I don't have that book \n<$?>  You just write down what   you hear You don't take in anything\n<$?> Yeah I don't have the book so I don't know any <unclear> several sylls </unclear> supposed to do One day we 're doing Orpheo and the next was The Fair Lady of Ascot or something They were okay but <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Then you went, who, where, what, and when\n<$D> She 's very detailed she 's  line numbers\n\n<$A> What do you, think of, what do you think about, what do you think of the of the of the  of the style of lecture\n<$?> I don't like it   I think it 's boring \n<$A>  You don't like it   It 's boring   I preferred O'Reilly now \n<$?>  I like it  \n<$?> I like her too\n<$E> I like it, except that like I 'm really exhausted after her lecture\n\n<$E> You 're trying to take down the whole story so\n\n<$A> Oh yeah I mean I, I 'm the very same I mean that first lecture on Julian of Norwich like, Wednesday I was glad it was going to be on my   left  left-handed, I I I  I was going like  all the way down Sure I mean I didn't stop until she 'd finished\n<$D>  Yeah exactly  \n<$D> That 's the same for The Fair Maid of Ascot I just wanted to get the story, so I know, knew the background, but you know what you 're talking about And like she 's rambling away talking and you 've to get everything down like\n<$?> Yeah yeah\n<$?> She 's really quick alright but she 's like, okay like she goes in and she explains what she 's talking about like Which I actually prefer it to <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>\n<$A> <unclear> several words </unclear> \n<$?> I think she 's

the two of us     Okay my advice to you is, get there early, get a decent seat in by the wall Okay Fight fight for it if you have to uhm cos I mean that means you won't have anybody on your, on your left, to try, on your right But there will always, there will have to be a seat between every person\n<$?>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$?>   Right \n<$?>  Oh yeah  \n<$?>   How will they fit us \n<$?>  Will there be room  \n<$A> We 'll try and fit you Okay So that 's why you need to get there early and get get a decent seat Uhm, uh, open book, you can bring in these texts and you can bring in that workbook and you can bring the handouts I gave you <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$C> You know when he asks about  Beowulf, can you like, use the other elegies and stuff to It depends on the question\n<$A> It depends on the question I mean if it 's first of all women in Beowulf it probably isn't brilliant Well no actually, hm, good point uhm If the question comes up which I don't think it will, if women come up, you could bring it in, you could bring in <unclear> several sylls </unclear>, but just to support it, okay\n<$?> Just say like, This is in Beowulf but the same thing is in\n<$A> Yeah Or or or uhm, also in <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> 's Lament we find we find this which backs up or uhm supports this argument Okay Now the women in Beowulf, it 'd be a gift if you got that, you 'd be lucky if you got that, brilliant  And uh Okay what I think, what I think you will get is in Middle English <unclear> several sylls </unclear>, is Orpheo and Mallory, okay Now the hints she gave out for Orpheo uhm Now if you if you want to go through these tell me, okay I I haven't got a watch so somebody tell me when it 's five to three Okay Uhm possible questions for Orpheo The differences between Orpheo as king and Orpheo as wild man Okay What are the differences between them, between Orpheo in in those two roles Uh okay The best reply to that, the best reply to that kind of question would be actually to question the question, if you understand that, to turn the question around and say, uhm, well actually is there any difference between, you know, is there any difference between Orpheo as a king and Orpheo as wild man And my feeling on there on that is that really there isn't, because you can back that up by saying uh he still has power in the natural world, he has his harp with him uh which is a symbol of his power and he uses that to, to soothe savage beasts Also he uses that in his own kingdom as well, uhm that 's what he 's renowned for, he 's renowned for playing, for his playing of the harp Okay So you can sort of question the question <unclear> several sylls </unclear> If you get a really narky question you don't want to say, oooh now what shall we do So you turn the question around and you answer it in a in a very, in a different way Cos I mean, I know I mean I 've sixty, I 've sixty-seven tutorial people okay, uhm say half, if half of you do Middle English, you know I know that 'll probably not be the case but uhm, and if if most of you do this or a similar question to this and you give me the same type of stuff, the marks will not be as high Like uhm that 's one thing in the exam in, in in June You will get a choice of of Old English and Middle English okay and language and society and do two out of three Uhm now, the highest marks go go for questions that are least answered, you know Okay So if you see a really weird one, you know, uhm and you think you can handle it, go for it Get higher marks Because they the, because those who are correcting it will have nothing to gauge it against You know what I mean If if you have something to gauge it against you go, no, wasn't as good as that one, no, yeah You see you 're sort of you 're sort of wondering how good it really is You know So that 's that 's that 's why uh the best marks actually go for languages and society, because very few people actually do Dr Farelli 's course and the questions, because they are a bit, they need a lot of, a lot of work, they need some sort of, you go in, you feel good and you can do the question That 's the only way you 're going to be dealing with Dr Farelli 's questions Unless you 're actually preparing for the second part of her of her course That 'll be in February so I 'll talk more about that then Uhm, but uhm if there is an internal choice on Thursday, go for the one that you think people won't answer, then you 'll get a higher mark Okay Uhm uh\n<$B> Unless you totally flop it \n<$A> Well no, you won't , you won't flop it if you have the book in front of you\n<$B> Oh right\n<$A> Okay Uhm, oh yeah, I 'm rambling here a bit Quotations, okay, in the class essay Okay If you if you want to use quotation marks you have to get it directly out of the book Okay You have to get the words directly out of the book The spelling can't be out Okay But if you don't want to use quotation marks you can paraphrase it to your heart 's delight And you can say, well uh Orpheo said that, you know, no quotation marks, and that 's it, you 're fine You sort of, you state what you think he said rather than what he actually did say, you know, but you don't put it in quotation marks And and and especially in Middle English, you don't have to get close to the spelling at all You can paraphrase in modern English And it 's the same it 's the same in the exam Okay Now uhm a second question for Orpheo, uhm, different locations of court and the fairy kingdom and the three <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> Uhm how are the locations in Orpheo described The location of the court, the fairy kingdom, and the hovel Okay, how are they described Uhm, what differences are there, what similarities, and uhm what does that say about the uhm, about each location\n<$?> There 's the court, the hovel, and what else\n<$A> Uh, the fairy kingdom, uh the fairy castle Okay, uhm now a third one The role of music in Orpheo Okay Very classic one, very classic Uhm okay, uhm, another possible one, uh, depictions of the hero and the heroine How, how is Orpheo, how is Orpheo uh portrayed and how is uhm Eurydice portrayed Uhm okay I haven't Can they be described as a hero and a heroine What do you what do you think of their description Do you think the description of Eurydice just according to her basically, her her outer looks, do you think that 's appropriate to the genre Do you think it 's appropriate to a romance Okay And if you don't, you know, tell us why It would be very interesting to hear it Okay Uhm, you know uh How is suspense built up in the poem and sustained Uh how does the poet how does the poet uh sustain the suspense Uh, like okay there are two, two different <unclear> several sylls </unclear> uhm when Eurydice had has had her dream, or when the fairy <unclear> several sylls </unclear> came to visit her, visited her in in her dream, uhm, when she wakes up she starts tearing her face We don't know why We 're going, hello, what 's happened, okay We don't know until she tells us So there 's suspense We 're waiting along with Orpheo, along with everybody else to find out what exactly happened Okay so uhm that 's one example of suspense being uh sustained and sort of uh being there Second one uhm, or a second one, not the second, a another one, uhm would be where uhm Orpheo 's playing his harp for the fairy king and uhm after he 's finished the king says to him, oh that was, man that was brilliant I 'll give you anything in the, anything in my kingdom <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and Orpheo says, okay I want her And the fairy king says, can't, this can't happen You 're you 're a minstrel Come on you 're a scumbag, you know You 're scum She 's a queen What 's what 's the, you can't cross this social class thing Okay you can't cross the   social  social scale Okay But but uh we 're sort of wondering like will he will he give in Will he actually give uh Orpheo back his wife or not Okay so that 's another bit of suspense there Okay there are a few more areas as well so try and find them before Thursday Okay uhm the form of the poem itself, uhm it 's a Breton lai, it 's a romance What does this, what does this say to you Uhm what do you expect in in this What should you expect And maybe uhm uh, does it actually come, does the poem actually live up to uh the genre, to the form of the poem, to what uhm a romance is Okay Now if you get that question I will be deeply disappointed Uhm It 's one of those questions\n<$?>  Order  \n<$C?> Will the question be subdivided,   will it be  No\n<$A>  No   Don't think so I hope not for your sake Uhm <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$C?> What if you haven't a clue of it like\n<$B?> Yeah you could maybe know one part of it like\n<$A> Well yeah, well I mean you do that and then half-way, but I mean don't spend uh, okay if there 's two parts to the question okay and you only do one, you only get, you only get marked out of fifty", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4ffd286d-f036-44b6-9850-3ed21cb8b4c7", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.247912+00:00"}
{"text": "<Clinicians 1>\n\n\n<$A> Right, so we all survived anyway \n<$?>   Yeah \n<$?>  Yeah \n<$B>  Just   about,\n<$A> Okay uhm so you just need to go through yeah and evaluate your session plans uh written or whatever,   Uh \n<$C>  When   when do you want them for sorry\n<$A> Uhm today is it, Well I suppose if you can have them done by this afternoon yeah great, Is that possible\n<$C>   Yeah \n<$?>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yup Okay, so those for this afternoon and then uhm you need to be thinking about for next week okay what you 're going to do\n<$?>   Yeah \n<$?>  Yeah \n<$?>  Yeah  \n<$A> So oh just actually to go back to today in terms of the people who are doing groups right uhm When you did the group rules I  I Is it safe to assume the rules were generated by both yourselves and the people who were the members of the group\n<$?>   Yeah \n<$?>  Yeah \n<$?>  Yes  \n<$A> Okay and so I 'd recommend that you write them down,   uhm  and review them at the beginning of every, group session whatever\n<$B>  Okay  \n<$B> Okay\n<$C> When you say review them what do you mean   like \n<$A>  Just   go through what the group rules are,   Okay  So before we start it just go back   over , uhm the rules we decided on last week That kind of thing\n<$C>  Okay  \n<$C>  Okay  \n<$D> And would you suggest that we uhm, like throughout the weeks you know the way especially these lead-up weeks to Christmas, that we keep reviewing things that we keep saying to them well like this is just the, you know   the beginning   the initial stages of the, therapy, Anything you find now tell me we can and then we can incorporate it into the therapy sessions   each week \n<$B>  Initial stages  \n<$A>  Yeah   I  yeah I guess it 's going to depend on what specifically you 're doing Do you know what I   mean  So that if for example you are doing vocabulary and you decide to do geography words we 'll say whatever, and like you do five words per session Uh but that yeah you 'd probably have a look if you on your second session you 're go back at what words you did on the previous session Is that what you mean   No \n<$D>  Yes  \n<$D>  No   I mean with things like rules, opinions, approaches to things, that they  like that they know that they can comment on it and   that they can <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> it \n<$A>  Oh of course And if so if they   think of any new rules or any rules that they think   aren't  you know necessary   or \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D>  Anymore   and stuff   right \n<$A>  Absolutely   yeah Of course they can yeah, yeah, Uh and then the other thing actually just, I don't know did anyone find in their groups today that they were maybe one uh participant who was more dominant than another  , and  somebody who didn't really get a chance to kind of speak Did you find that\n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B> No I thought they were all speaking I don't know cos, Jamie wasn't there   But  I just thought that Michele was very like  whatever you know   type thing  And, you know I did try and include her like all the time uhm, but she was kind of reluctant And, then I felt I suppose, the guy, uh   Glen,  was kind of like, uh you know the cool guy but then again he 's a guy amongst four girls,   So I  don't know I 'll just wait til next week and see really\n<$A>  Okay  \n<$A>  Okay  \n<$A>  Ah who Glen yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yeah I think really that that 's the key thing   isn't it  that this week was quite   unstructured  You 're kind of just getting to   know each other \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah   and they didn't know they were together and,   that kind of thing like so \n<$A>  Yeah exactly, So   it 's going to take a while for the group to gel like whatever so I wouldn't give   up hope \n<$B>  Yeah  , It 's okay I haven't\n<$A> Yeah  uhm I wouldn't give up hope yet It 's yeah I think it 's you know it 's challenging   They 're  a challenging   age group because you know \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Mm, and there 's   a lot of them and they all talk together\n<$D> I was lucky with the two thankfully there was only two put into my small group, But I think with the larger groups, yeah we want them to respect you and like you and all that but, I think we still need to hold a slight not even a slight but, you are authority You you are the person in charge Like you being kicked that was totally and utterly, unacceptable   I like  I would have   freaked  Not freaked but I would have actually\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$C>  I did  \n<$C> But no I took care of it like   but  it you know it still happened you know\n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D>   But that 's  what I mean I mean what how are we to deal with that I mean\n<$B>  But then  \n<$B> Like how authoritative\n<$D> How authoritative   yeah can you know \n<$B>  Yeah, can   you   be \n<$C>  Well I   just said to them look straight off that 's not on It 's not going to happen   It 's , it won't be, That 's not the way it 's going to be and if it continues, you know I 'm going to have to deal with it in another way or whatever   Like  I mean it stops   you know  But it 's just they were just trying to prove a point I 'd say\n<$?>  Mm  \n<$?>  Yeah  \n<$?>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yeah and I think it is it 's a tricky issues alright   because \n<$?>  Yeah \n<$C>  No cos you   cos you don't are you the therapist or are you kind of a dictator\n<$A> Exactly and that you kind of assume maybe that at that age they will be able to participate in a   group  without resorting    to kicking you and kicking each other \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$C>  We had six year olds last year and   they were fabulous like preschoolers even   do you know \n<$D>  Yeah you see like   you don't know I mean\n<$A> You assume that you kind of treat them in an  you approach   them  with an adult kind of perspective and you think that they should be able to,\n<$?>  Yeah  \n<$D>   Reciprocate that adult yeah \n<$C>  I still think you should do that though  \n<$A> Oh   yeah absolutely uh exactly  but it 's just that then, when they behave like that it 's kind of surprising   because you  think oh\n<$D>  Oh I 'm not saying you shouldn't  \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$B> Because it 's easy just to slip into a teacher kind of a\n<$A> You yeah and that kind of   dynamic you know of I 'm in charge And that 's not therapeutic,  you   know \n<$B>  Role yeah Charge yeah And be quite like yeah you know  \n<$D>  That 's   not therapeutic but then I think, we 're just we 're in a school situation, I think I 'm I 'm totally for the   therapeutic  way of approaching of thing I mean of all the people   I 'd I 'd be very much for that \n<$A>  Oh yeah  \n<$A>  And yes but you 're the group 's   leader like   and facilitator \n<$D>  You would still   yeah You 're a facilitator Still you mean you need to   make sure \n<$C>  Is there anything   like we could flick through on the group dynamics or anything like   that \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$A> Uhm, I wonder Now I can't think of anything off the top of my head I have to say But maybe\n<$C> There should be some somewhere I suppose if you just went   through a book on group therapy \n<$A>  There yeah   on because there should be stuff on group   work we 'll say \n<$C>  Clinical practicum   actually I think there 's one   or two books on that \n<$A>  Michael <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  , And maybe that one I know that you said it 's out I 'll have a look at that one the Wallik and Butler one and see if there 's anything about\n<$C> \n<$A> Wallik and Butler I can't think of the name but do you remember Lisa Marie I gave you the reference\n<$D> Yup\n<$A> Uhm and that 's all about, kind of language development in relation to the curriculum   and  the classroom and working with adolescents\n<$C>  Oh  \n<$C> Oh yeah I actually yeah   I had that book \n<$A>  But I think   you were saying all the copies are out   in the libraries \n<$D>  Yeah all the copies   are out when I was looking   I 'm after booking one \n<$C>  Is that the pink one  \n<$B> Yeah\n<$D>   And \n<$B>  I left   I left it in yesterday It 's there for you\n<$C> Oh okay\n<$B> Yeah I didn't see that <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Okay I yeah I 'm not that familiar with it but there might be something in   it  or any of the uh kind of clinical practice books   might have stuff on groups \n<$C>  Okay  \n<$D>  You know what would be good too, books,   That course that we do, used to do in fourth year It 's like, the teacher comes in and gives you this picture of all friends playing in the yard and, ye all 've to talk about what it is and it 's giving you, oh what 's the name of the course The course you do\n<$B> Uh assertiveness is it\n<$D> No it 's not assertiveness It 's like, the new CSPE course that they do for in schools now\n<$C> SPHC\n<$D> SPHC yeah It 's like that but it 's\n<$B> Mm\n<$C> Is it civics\n<$A> Like civics is it\n<$D> Civics   yeah \n<$B>  Oh okay  \n<$D> Those books have all are all into how,   how  you lead a group and how   I was  that 's where I got that thing over at my, my sister 's big into it And she 's like Michele the way she 's pure oh I 'm so cool You get her to do   everything  in the group You get her to hand out the sheets You get her to collect the sheets,   because  she 's being miss cool because she actually wants attention She 's   uhm  there 's a niche in her, in her like in her mm   whatever that I  don't I 'll get one off my sister cos my sister is, does that course   so she does \n<$B>  Kind of  \n<$C>  Oh right  \n<$C>  Mm  \n<$A>  Oh okay  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$C>  That 'd be a good book What 's it called Lisa Marie  \n<$A>  But there must   be I 'm sure yeah if you do like,   a literature search  or whatever and something came up about   the dynamics  Uhm and try that is it I X quick dot com\n<$D>  There 's a  \n<$D>  <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear>  \n<$C> What is it\n<$D> IX quick,   WWW  dot IX quick   dot  com Yeah\n<$C>  I  \n<$D>  Q-U-I-C-K  \n<$D> Dot com\n<$A> Is it IX quick IX    IX  quick Ah it 's very good It searches loads of\n<$?>  Yeah  \n<$C> What is it, a search   engine \n<$A>  But it searches about I don't know how many everything  \n<$C> Oh   right \n<$B>  It 's a meta   search engine\n<$A> Yeah,\n<$C> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> a train\n<$A> Yes  Very clever That 's what I heard about from it as well\n<$D> Is <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> done with it\n<$A> Yeah so you can you can just type in group plus dynamics plus, whatever   and  it rates things into in this like there 's stars as to which with the most is the best one   match <unclear> 3 sylls

woodwork at though\n<$C> What time did I go in at, eleven, so it was at eleven forty\n<$A> He has woodwork at eleven   forty , Oh yeah and we have him down for the   well  we have to change that group anyway,   because \n<$C>  Mm  \n<$C>  Mm  \n<$B>  Especially so   because Ted wants the earlier, would prefer the earlier slot because he has woodwork at twenty past twelve\n<$A> And then the, well you see the two, there are two people in your group at eleven forty   who go for counselling  at twelve so we need to change that group anyway,   Okay , So we could conceivably switch that to five past eleven  ,  And then Fred Lappin has woodwork at twelve forty   no twelve twenty \n<$C>  <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> yeah  \n<$C>  Okay  \n<$C>  Okay  \n<$C>  Twenty  , and wasn't impressed\n<$A> That 's fair enough I can understand that And, Tom O'Byrne has woodwork at eleven forty, Okay so we 'll just have to, your groups 'll stay the same but the timing will be different    possibly  more than likely\n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B> Because uhm it was a bit confusing today because my group was earlier,   But  I was like oh what do you have, at eleven or whatever And I think, Laura was on about that she had reading with Mr Duffy And then I was there, oh maybe you 're not going to have it now I don't know,   I think but \n<$A>  Well  \n<$A>  Right well I think   that today is all because Melanie brought the people\n<$C> Mm yeah that was my fault\n<$A> No it doesn't matter like, but it just meant that you know   it things sort of went  in the order we were   anticipating , Uhm so hopefully Tim Duffy will have the appointment cards for the students, for next week so that they 'll just know the time and they 'll arrive But we 'll have to give them the updated schedule, Okay uh so then you just need to go and plan yeah, what are you going to do for next week So for the people who are doing, literacy yeah I mean uh, I can't really say any more than what 's in this   already  so a higher level of particularly phoneme\n<$B>  It was just <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  \n<$B>  In synch  \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D> Do you know the way when you, I mean that 's a higher level but at the moment, I don't know how much phonemes they know or they don't know about phoneme <unclear> several sylls </unclear> So I am just going start at, step one And if, I mean we might fly through step one two and three <$A> Yeah\n<$D> But I 'm just going to literally start with the alphabet   like \n<$A>  Yeah   because the work kind of up until Christmas really is diagnostic   And it 's a kind of  just finding out at what level they 're operating at, and so that you can kind of pitch your therapy then at   the right  level\n<$D>  Yeah <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>  \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$B> So is step one like alphabet, kind of, grapheme phoneme   correspondence \n<$D>  <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  That 's  \n<$A> Yeah, yeah, Okay so syllable organisation, your phonemes within clusters Uhm, so that 's literacy group one, but literacy group two then however, that 's the same thing but more syllable, level Okay so the vocabulary work then Yeah look at things like, there 's downstairs you know the uh Vanilla Vocabulary I think it 's called\n<$B> Yeah I looked at the vocabulary maps\n<$A> Yeah That 's another one\n<$B> Okay, so like would I actually start with stuff like that\n<$A> Oh absolutely   yeah \n<$B>  Yeah   and just get, like just get them working on the English vocabulary and geography vocabulary   or whatever \n<$A>  Yeah  , and like using kind of multi-modal, in   that  like It 's not just the written word You may have pictures to go along with   it  or a story that puts the words in   context  Uhm and as you 're also talking about uhm, like that 's written here, so word families So you might talk about nouns, verbs, adjectives  , uhm  words that mean almost the same as, Okay So   that  if you 're talking about, uhm let me think, word from geography like exploration, was one of the ones I did last year So you 've exploration in terms of going to Antarctica   as  an explorer  , but  you 've exploration in terms of oil wells and  you know that kind of   thing So  that you give them like, the range of meanings for the word, and then maybe if it 's, and if it 's appropriate words that mean almost the same or words that are the   opposite  Oh   okay  So they 're kind of establishing those   links  semantically Uhm and again anyone get got uh, you got an English book didn't you   Uhm  <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Okay  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  Yeah, okay  \n<$B>  Okay  \n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B>  Okay  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$?> <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Oh okay\n<$C> Like should I read the whole book, You know\n<$A> Oh no   I 'd \n<$B>  I 'd say   scan\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> For the word\n<$C> I  I can't scan I don't know I can't do that\n<$A> Well then pick a chapter   and  Oh hang on it 's the whole of I mean you just got the  the book The Outsiders out Sorry yeah Thought you meant a textbook, Then I 'd read the first chapter\n<$C>  Okay  \n<$?> And the last chapter\n<$A> Yeah exactly  and see, you know, what kind of, the kind of vocabulary You 're working on expressive language isn't it\n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> Uhm, I would look at the kind of vocabulary that 's, cropping up\n<$C> So the vocabulary to watch out for\n<$A> Yeah   and can, do they \n<$C>  And I suppose if there 's   any examples of figurative language that I   can <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Absolutely   yeah, Okay so it doesn't just have to be like English and, geography words or   whatever  you know  I suppose having from today hopefully you have, discussed with them, you know, what are the kind of things that they find easy Which things do they find difficult in terms of subjects Are there   any subjects  in particular that they like, And you could always kind of take a subject that they like and target the vocabulary,   in that    subject  Uh just one thing to do, or another thing to do with vocabulary as well is when you 're teaching it, if you 're going to give Like giving a definition is really only one way of knowing a word   Okay  So and often then what happened last year was that if you went to the dictionary to define the word, the first definition in the dictionary   wasn't  necessarily the one that you had intended to teach   So  just to watch out for that kind of thing Uhm, and, so getting them to use the word in a sentence as well, it 's not enough to just be able to define it   but  can they use it Uhm, and just be clear as well yourself about the definition of the   word  like we talked about this morning in relation to the   figurative language \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Okay  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  is wrong  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Mm   to take a back seat\n<$A> Yeah that we had different ideas as to what it meant\n<$B> Yeah okay\n<$A> Okay, So that 's vocabulary Uhm, so there 's yeah Vanilla Vocabulary downstairs and the vocabulary with, what do they call it\n<$B> Vocabulary maps\n<$A> Vocabulary maps yeah There is a programme as well, now I don't know if we have it any more, or maybe they have it in the school, called Inspiration And it 's just it 's doing that kind of vocabulary mapping on a computer programme  , And  it 's very good cos you can organise\n<$B>  Okay  \n<$C> It 's on computer here is it\n<$A> I don't   think so \n<$B>  I think   Felice had the programme or something\n<$A> Yeah and you could get it for a trial   period  or whatever, but then it  goes out Uh like it self-destructs after however many days \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$C> What\n<$B> Not really\n<$C> That 's like  I thought you were \n<$A> And this CD   if you do  survive it will self-destruct  No it 's sort   of it 's \n<$B>  <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> dangerous  \n<$D>  It 's all   confidential  You can only have it for a certain amount of time\n<$A> No you yeah exactly you can only use if for   thirty  days or whatever, Uhm, okay the expressive language group then uh, that 's you isn't it   Vera , Okay so the figurative language, uhm now uh And again there is that book downstairs Saying One Thing Meaning   Another  And there 's a I 'm sure there 's another one on figurative language down there as well,\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$D> There 's one about   cartoons \n<$B>  There   is yeah\n<$A> Is it Yeah maybe that 's   the one I 'm thinking \n<$D>  There 's a few   Yeah there 's other cartoons   there \n<$A>  Yeah   so there 's plenty of   materials , there like whatever\n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$C> Should I be like, say, like, say for my individual level like I want to be hitting like, say her reader and vocabulary, figurative language, and literacy Should I be spending ten minutes in each of those four areas\n<$A> That 's a Yeah you can decide   to do it like that \n<$C>  Is that what I should be trying to do   or should I be focusing on one, or two a week and\n<$A> Well I think I 'd like I 'd leave that up to you to decide See what you think is\n<$C> Which is more efficient\n<$A> Mm,\n<$C> Cos I don't want to totally boggle her either   you know \n<$A>  Yeah   exactly So you don't want to have too much I think it 's a good idea to actually specify how long you 're going to spend on each   activity  because then you have your session nicely structured and you know how much time you have   cos  uh, the time, of course, is important as   well  And I know today was different but that that you 're ready to, once we have the, room that you 're ready to start so that you know you 've ten minutes for this ten minutes for this, and you 're keeping an eye on the time and you know, okay I have to finish at twenty to twelve, and then you 're ready to finish\n<$C>  Mm  \n<$C>  Mm  \n<$C>  Yeah", "subdomain":

{"text": "<English lit class>\n\n\n<$A> Is he simply making the the notion of choice clearer by  placing it back in a historical time where where people have less obvious choices, or uhm, or is, or is he saying that uhm in fact the twentieth century is also That that, you know, while it, while people don't talk to you like a dog if you if you happen to be employed by them because if they do you 'll take them to an employment equality tribunal or something or you 'll walk out, or or something like that Uhm but that, but that that 's only surface and that in fact the constraints are as major, Do you think the constraints are internal, no You think not\n<$B> I think uh like, I think he 's saying you know that we are we are limited like, in in this century, but we have multiple choice in like, in those terms you know, like, like we we can kind of marry who we want, things like that you know We have a lot more choice in things like them you know Kind of, we, there 's a lot like expected of us but like you know we can deviate quite a bit and get away with it you know, and they couldn't in those days\n<$C> But at but at the same time like good service got to be presented as an ideal and it 's still true that uhm we can never, we might chase that but it 's not really possible to end up with such uhm you know, the living happily ever after or whatever with that Because  uh when she becomes an actual person, that still that uhm these days like you can never make the ideal real I suppose\n<$A> Mm It it 's quite interesting to compare, this with the first novel we looked at, Moll Flanders, because Moll you could say was somebody who makes those kind of choices But there 's a totally different emphasis isn't there I mean it is clear that one of the reasons that Sarah has to listen to Mrs Fulton is that she has no money So that the sense of economic uhm oppression is fairly strongly there and it 's only at the end where she meets the, you know, the community of artists, uhm who are going to offer her a way in which she can both, you know, develop herself in some way and also be free of of want uhm, that uhm that she can escape from the grosser aspects of economic oppression\n<$D> You have Sam as well, who works, <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Sam, the servant who works with Williams\n<$C> Both of them\n<$D> Yeah Both of them\n<$A> Mm Now one of the things that would be different in the twentieth century would be that uhm people would on the whole be a lot freer from that kind of gross economic necessity Wouldn't they, I mean there 's the, well, I mean there 's almost nobody now who would be forced to go into that kind of almost slavery in in order to you know to get a bit to eat because we tend to live in communities which kind of say that everybody is, you know, is entitled to the sort of basic minimum, uhm might not provide them with much dignity but  but at at least there you know there is that kind of uhm feeling that people in society cannot own each other and oppress each other in in the way that 's represented in this book in in fairly terrifying terms Because a lot of it, even, I mean even that subtext of the footnotes is about exploitation I mean those child prostitutes uhm, the other Sarah, I mean what happens with the other Sarah He 's he 's he 's looking for Sarah, he thinks that she might have gone because he thinks she 's a fallen woman Uhm and he thinks she might have gone to London to become one of the vast mass of, sort of you know ladies of the night, women of the street sort of or whatever And, so he wanders round London looking for her and he sees a woman uhm who looks like her And in a sense of total and aimless desperation and despair he goes with her And her name turns out to be Sarah as well And it it it revolts him, and doesn't,\n<$D> Mm He gets sick\n<$A> He gets sick Uh but he also discovers that this woman has been forced into prostitution because she has a child, uhm to keep, no And it 's bringing home to him uhm a lot of things that he had not been prepared to accept about his society\n<$D> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> describes Mrs <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> as Nazi-ish So it 's sort of, it 's all connected,\n<$A> But then, can we say, if he 's saying that these basic conditions or limitations on choice remain the same, why do you think he set it in the nineteenth century\n<$D> To stress it more\n<$A> Yeah that 's one, one possibility,  present it in rather more extreme terms\n<$D> Yeah yeah\n<$A> Uhm the other one is is that a lot of twentieth-century novelists have been basically writing historical novels uhm because they see it as as a kind of uh escape beyond uhm limitations, uhm so there 's an escape either back into the past, where things are slightly different so that you can you can look at, you know the way if you take something out of its context and you put it into a slightly unfamiliar context it provides uhm that that sense of defamiliarisation which allows you to look at it afresh You can do that either by going into the past or by writing, you know science fiction or fantasy or something which has the same kind of effect of defamiliarisation because there 's the feeling It 's partly partly, you know the old feeling you can't see the wood for the trees Uhm but that, if you 're used to always sort of seeing things in  particular conceptual terms uhm that it 's very very difficult to recognise what 's happening So that quite often they use the uhm, you know this notion of the past as almost as if it was a journey into another kind of sphere Uh but of course it raises the problem that people will not necessarily know how to read the novel and and that people tend to read historical novels in terms of their historical accuracy, because we still expect from the novel that degree of factual representation, so you can kind of say well, does he capture the speech of the people of the time You know Are the descriptions of dress, of clothing, of furniture, of mental attitudes, of assumptions, are they, you know, are they accurate Uhm because again even with a novel which is deconstructing the notion of factual representation uhm people are still trained to read novels uhm and expect that kind of factual representation, Now in order to to assess that you will probably need to be a historian almost Or does it not matter\n<$D> I don't think it does I mean, you just read it as a story <unclear> several sylls </unclear> maybe to some people <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the whole detail, but you just take it as a story really\n<$A> Mm Lots of people love Anthony Trollope 's novels even though some people think they 're dull and they like them because of of you know the accuracy of of the representation So you don't need to read nineteenth-century history, all you need to do is read Anthony Trollope You know it 's sort of, you know history sugared, sort of way Much more palatable than reading blue books of parliamentary reports <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Anyway, for those of you who have not read Fowles, do you think that you will\n<$B> Along with a hundred other ones\n<$A> Along with along with a hundred other ones Okay Well as I say at this stage maybe we can kind of uhm just have some sort of look at the way the uhm the term has gone We 've managed to read one two three four five six, well at least we we we have we have discussed eight novels <break in tape> So, has your experience then been just of being being overwhelmed\n<$B> \n<$D> I 've only got to read three books\n<$A> You 've only got to read three books for the exam\n<$D> Oh right <laughs>\n<$A> But does that, but but but does that not uhm give you a feeling of frustration\n<$D> Yeah I wasn't thinking that way yeah If I 'd   had time I would like  to have read them\n<$A>  Yeah yeah  \n<$A> Yeah So why do you say you only have to read three books\n<$D> No I just did No that 's all I   read yeah yeah \n<$A>  Oh yes   that 's all you did yeah\n<$B> I think uh, the the, you know the idea that the exams are there you know oppresses like it 's it 's kind of, puts you off kind of, you know, or It kind of puts pressure on you you know to, you know you have, there 's so much in each subject you can only do so much on each you know And like the object of the course is to read as much as you can, and you know, get to know the different writers  et-cetera It 's hard to to do that, you know It 's hard to get everything read Because like essays and all as well you have to do\n<$A> What do you think would be the right thing to do, to vastly reduce the amount of things that are covered or Because the other argument is that even if you can't get round to reading them you 're, you 're sort of introduced to them and you get to know maybe about things that, you know that you wouldn't\n<$C> It is valuable too   You take notes at the lectures  and, get around to it sometime but still, you  you do come out of most tutorials and lectures interested in actually reading them but, and really intending to but, you just never get the time because then you 're into your next one and you say, I 'd better leave that So, I don't know if there 's any answer really\n<$D>  And then you can go and read it if you want to  \n\n<$A> What about the sense though that the course is also meant to give you some sort of sense of the development of, you know, of the novel Uhm, have you have you kind of, have you got that yet or, are you having to wait til the end of the   lecture course \n<$B>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear>   The way it 's gone backwards, you know you 're doing twentieth, then nineteenth and eighteenth, and that 's that 's difficult you know If it was going the other way, it would be would be better I suppose\n<$A> Yeah\n<$C> You pick up something but, I don't know I suppose one could end up the year to, say for sure\n<$A> See if, yeah, see if it makes any sense The trouble about somebody like Fowles you see is is that, well it, I suppose like, most of these novelists, is that they are writing in response to other novelists, and it 's very very difficult to pick up everything unless you 've read the, you know, the thing that that they 're responding to, where they 're kind of saying, well you know, Jane Austen did it like this, but I don't actually think that that 's kind of getting at the heart of it so what I 'm going to do is rewrite that story with a different emphasis, you know, kind of putting in all of the things that she left out or focusing, you know not on the kind of the resolution or reconciliation with societal demands but on the impossibility of that kind of reconciliation Now uhm I mean, I 'm not quite sure who else he would have been influenced by uh but Dickens I think very very clearly I mean Fowles 's first novel The Magus uh is is a rewriting of Great Expectations Well he said he was teaching Great Expectations at the time and it was sort of, stayed in the back of his mind, you know, all all of the time while he was writing the book and I think, can can you pick up enough, from reading a novel or should you be expected to, you know, to know all all sorts of things, you know, when you when you approach it Even on on, I mean, or is it simply that there are different kinds of readings, and you read with kind of more or less uhm interest as you\n<$D> Great Expectations \n<$A> Mm What about the other idea, then, that used to be popular, which is that, all of these books should raise all sorts of questions that are relevant to you You know, so that you read a book, you recognise an experience in it, and then that leads you on to, to debate the condition of the world Does does that happen I mean does that happen when you go out of here You kind of say, well you know the questions that were raised there and that you you know you talk to each other about it\n<$D> Not really \n<$B> Well uh we like I think, like other students, you talk more, more so about novels than you do about any other part of the course like poetry or drama You talk more about novels than, and you know what 's what 's really the point and that kind of , you know, of each novel and things like that, so\n<$A> Yeah I 'm, I just think that nowadays people kind of seem to be less excited uhm about the kinds of issues that are raised and I wonder if it isn't the sort of you know the terrible pressure of trying to get, you know, trying to get results rather than kind of feeling a sense of space where, you know, where you can sort of, discuss existentialism until three o'clock in the morning I mean does that happen any more I don't get the impression that it does but it certainly used to,\n<$D> People are more interested in talking about trivial things really", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "5d5980f6-f80d-4e37-ad08-ccd4a00fd54f", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.251106+00:00"}
{"text": "<Chernobyl>\n\n\n<$B> The actual language as I 've said before, it was suppressed by Soviet rule and uh, you had high levels of retention in uh in the isolated southern provinces and villages because the Soviets didn't, weren't really around those isolated areas to actually enforce uhm, to actually disapprove of the use of  the  of the Belarusian language Uh according to the nineteen ninety-nine census, about thirty-eight percent of Belarusian residents speak Belarusian in their everyday lives, eighty-two percent consider Belarusian their mother tongue, so There isn't actually much evidence to say this but I 'd say that, that retention of Belarusian is mostly in rural areas where uh the older generations retain the language and there has been a trend for uh younger generations to actually migrate to bigger cities to find more employment So actually coming to the nuclear disaster now after all that Uhm just to give a quick background The failed experiment uhm caused an explosion in the reactor of the Chernobyl power plant on the twenty-sixth of April nineteen eighty-six Uh tonnes of radionuclides of caesium <.> plutonium, uranium, iodine were released into the atmosphere and spread by prevailing south easterly winds As I said before, most of that fallout actually went over Belarus even though the, the uh plant was actually located within the Ukraine And just to  quickly explain uh what radionuclides are, they 're unstable particles of radioactivity, that when they 're released into the atmosphere they can be absorbed by any living matter For instance uhm plutonium is actually absorbed into the bones instead of calcium, so if there 's plutonium in the atmosphere or in the food you 're eating, your body will  will preferentially absorb that and that 's why there has been such an increase in cancers in Belarus and uh so many well-documented uh outbreaks of cancer-related illnesses I 'm not going to go into those illnesses too much because it 's a huge area and that 's what 's usually seen when, when you examine the whole Chernobyl uhm event, Uhm this is the actual power plant itself Uhm I think this, this picture 's interesting because it doesn't really demonise the plant Uhm most of the most of the pictures you see of the actual power plant shows this big crater uhm with just debris everywhere and people in big uhm zipped up suits trying to clean it up, and that in a way is kind of, it kind of fosters the whole uhm, the whole thoughts of paranoia and doom that people have in Belarus associated with the event, The actual evacuation uh was co-ordinated by Moscow Immediately when this happened the Soviets uhm heard of it, as soon as it happened, and they thought that it would be very damaging for their, their rule, for this to actually emerge as a major disaster in Belarus So they immediately uhm, they drafted plans to actually deal with it and uh the following day involved around forty thousand people leaving Prypyat in one thousand one hundred buses within less than three hours Now all the numbers that I 've used for evacuation in this presentation, they 're all estimates because there really is, there 's no uhm, there 's no official figures about where the people went, how many of them went, and where they went, because This could have stopped my project in its tracks because I initially wanted to establish a spatial distribution of evacuees This is impossible because the Soviets were so secretive about their actual research that uh they didn't release any of, any of their research documents until the fall of the USSR\n\n<$A> I think you need to conclude shortly Sine/ad\n<$B> Okay Uh radiophobia again was a big obstacle for people in the cities uhm and then sort of trends of hypochondria and uh further paranoia started to come out uh among the younger generations and there 's a question, did a , did Chernobyl replace the hopelessness, hopeless oppression of the Soviet rule in Belarus Uhm just to reiterate again the whole emergency of Chernobyl as an actual feeling of doom and way of thinking among the Belarusian people And just to conclude, new cultural patterns Uh adulteration of the environment with radioactivity so the breaking of the bond of people from the , breaking off, the bonds of people living with the, from the land And then again it 's just a <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> I was talking about before Uhm the dispersion of villages which retained uh traditions and languages Villages were , villages uh traditionally were the places where people actually uhm practised the old traditions of gathering food and indigenous recipes, things like that Uhm the creation of the slums for evacuees who became an ethnic minority in their own country which I think is a fairly unique uh occurrence Uh again a culture of paranoia and doom And finally, thousands of children migrating from Belarus each year with leukaemia I haven't mentioned this much because obviously it 's a big area as well But uhm the Belarusian government initially really didn't like this occurrence because it showed up the government as being incompetent and not being able to deal with their own problems And of course the permanently changed demography of the evacuated zones in Belarus which are basically now abandoned apart from a few old people and will gradually dwindle and just overgrow within the next few hundred years That 's the end\n\n<$A> Okay Questions, comments for Sine/ad\n<$C>  The the people that stayed behind in uh in the town, like the old ladies and also the uhm, uh the the vagabonds and the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> What, you know, what would they eat, how would they live \n<$B> Oh there 's, I mean, if you think about it this was a really productive agricultural area and the produce is still there except it 's unclean I mean there 's, there was still animals around, there was all sorts of crops\n<$C>  Just abandoned \n<$B> Yeah Just abandoned because they couldn't actually continue to , to uhm, to export that sort of stuff, because if you export grain from the area it 's going to contaminate the rest of the country It 's going to contaminate anywhere that you export it to basically, so they have to stop all, stop all movement of of produce out of the area So if you looked at it in a, in a whole, in a real sense, it was a really productive area and anyone who didn't have anything, they just went there There was loads of food but, it  it 's going to make them sick you know but, they didn't see it that way\n<$C>  What 's it like now Are they all dead or are they still alive \n<$B> Uhm, it 's very difficult to  to actually find contemporary sources on the state of the culture in Belarus because, as I said before, people aren't really interested in this They 're interested in the medical consequences, uh bringing children out, uh bringing children to different countries to try and make them better and stuff like that Uhm I 'm not really sure what the state of the uh, of the contaminated zone is I 'd imagine it 's a it 's a similar, similar to what I just illustrated there Some uh old people are returning because they don't want to be relocated in different places and uh just the influx of people who want to, opportunists who want to take some fruits of the land\n<$D> Have there been any uhm physical mutations to preceding generations\n<$B> There has yeah And that 's another reason why people kind of are engulfed by a feeling of hopelessness because they see, they see uh the fact that if I get married and if I grow up, my children probably will be sick or they 'll have genetic mutations, things like that So in a way it actually affects the race of the Belarusian people in that in the way that the effects of it will be seen for thousands of years to come\n<$A> Okay, are, oh\n<$E>  Just a quick query You know the way there was this thirty kilometre   arbitrary  contamination zone To what extent do they know now that they 've actually gone in and looked, how much of the area that was deemed uncontaminated it 's now realised that they   have to evacuate  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B>  Uhm well there 's six  , there 's six provinces in Belarus and three down in the south They 're the ones that were hit the most badly and, I mean really if you want to establish an actual zone of contamination you have to go in there and measure like two, tens of metres And since they went, since the disaster they 've been sending , they 've been sending groups of scientists into the contaminated zones to actually try and measure this in greater detail But basically they go round and they just, they just measure uh and then decide on, decide on the basis of how many people are living near a contaminated zone I mean it 's very difficult to actually, find a published distribution of contaminated zones They they don't like that sort of thing coming out Uhm they don't really want people to know and\n<$E>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear> an awful lot of secrecy around it then still or \n<$B> Uhm I 'd say, if you  if you went to the government resources probably they would, they would be more forthcoming But certainly in in earlier times the Soviets didn't, the Soviets were extremely paranoid about any sort of information coming out And uh even you know I 'd say the Belarusian government as well are guilty of damage limitation They 're trying to say, no actually you, you actually live in a safe area so we won't have to bother moving you, you know\n<$F> Is there a time frame for decontamination <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>\n<$B> See the thing about all these radioactive nuclides that were expelled, as I Remember I said about the half lives Iodine has a half life of a few hours so effectively iodine doesn't exist any more around the plant Something like plutonium could have a half life of twenty-three thousand years So, you 're looking at that, or at the contaminated zones being  rendered uninhabitable for the rest of the time that humans are on the earth, you know It 's pretty profound\n<$G> What 's the relationship like between Ukraine and Belarus now, after that\n<$B> Uhm I think the Ukraine economically did much better after the fall of the USSR because they are much more into capitalist reform Uhm, as I said, the dictator, he just came in, and he was a Soviet sympathiser so he didn't want to uhm, he didn't want to develop the currency or anything like that The Ukraine were better able to deal with it financially because their evacuations were much more efficient Uhm I 'm not sure what the situation is now but obviously there would be a bit of begrudgery harboured against Ukraine because the, Belarus doesn't have any nuclear power plants at all,\n<$A> Right, we 'll have to draw to a close there Uh will you put your disc in Uhm I thought that was, was really interesting, this notion of an ethnic group being defined by radioactivity rather than by language or dress or anything else it is actually, and it is, I think it is in many respects, the correct use of the term Uhm, they 're recognised as a group Do they actually have a name for them\n<$B> Uh they probably have slang names like, oh he 's radioactive Keep away from him, you know That 's\n<$A> Yeah Cos that 'd be interesting because that 's another thing for an ethnic group is that they have a, a name, an ethno name\n<$B> They probably have slang names I think they do have slang names <unclear> several sylls </unclear>, Oh he 's radioactive or <unclear> several sylls </unclear> but it haven't looked into it too much I haven't really found information about it\n<$A> The other thing I was interested in is, can they marry, Or  is it is it impossible\n<$B> Well you 're looking at a sort of a Nazist notion of permission to marry because they 're they 're  they 're not pure you know You can't do that to people\n<$A> No but, is there real problems in them\n<$B> Well, I mean there is an extent of uh infertility as well as cancers, things like that But it 's not, it 's not a significant trait of uhm radioactive contamination But it would be a problem to some extent", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b217a173-9fc2-4390-833e-4408f9984ec2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.252457+00:00"}
{"text": "<Counterpoint 1>\n\n\n<$A> And so to our studio panel Father Brian D'arcy, uh he 's a native of Fermanagh but spent many years in the Republic before he returned to Northern Ireland Brian D'arcy is a regular broadcaster and Sunday newspaper columnist Doctor Bill Rolston lectures in sociology at the University of Ulster and he has written extensively on Northern Ireland And joining us from Dublin is Michael Farrell, a leading light in the civil rights movement of the late sixties and he is now a practising lawyer Now Michael Farrell, do you think people would be surprised in the Republic uh by that opinion poll survey that says like only fifty-two percent of Catholics really want a united Ireland\n<$B> Well I think there have been a few reports like that recently Uhm I myself would think that perhaps a more relevant question is to ask uh how many of them are satisfied with the present situation in Northern Ireland because I think the the the real problem is that there is a conflict in the North and that clearly the the Nationalist population are discontent with the present situation, whatever they think the the ultimate answer to it is\n<$A> But sorry, isn't that  I mean you 've got to separate peace from a united Ireland as the only outcome of peace and then take a look at who wants a united Ireland\n<$B> Well I think that peace is only likely to come I I 'm not saying that peace can only come with a united Ireland but I think that peace is only likely to come when you have a settlement which addresses the concerns of the the Nationalist uh minority in the North and I think that still a very substantial section of that minority, uh they may not want a united Ireland overnight but I think they certainly do want something like joint authority They want something where the Southern government has a role in the governance of the North in order to act as a as a protector to them against a return to undiluted Unionist rule\n<$A> Bill Rolston, from uh your point of view as a sociologist, have you been surprised by anything you 've seen and heard tonight\n<$C> No, I I think that as a sociologist I have a scepticism about opinion polls at the best of times and especially opinion polls that, that ask for so much in in such a simple question Uh the interesting thing to me is not so much the fifty-two percent who want the united Ireland or say they want the united Ireland, but the other forty-eight percent who have either answered no or are undecided Now,  what is contained in that no or that  indecision Is it, uh I don't want it right now uh I don't want it if it means I have to lose out uh economically uh I don't want it if it means that uh assassinations are going to increase because the Loyalists would be angry I mean there there 's so many things contained in those nos and undecideds that  to me that 's the interesting thing and you 'd need you 'd need more of an opinion poll a deeper set of questions to get at some of those nuances\n<$A> Brian D'arcy   out  out in the country, do you get the impression that that one of the things Bill refers to there that is I don't want a united Ireland if I 'm not going to be as well off as I am   is a big issue \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D>  Well  , yeah you  you certainly get that but I actually think the whole idea of the discussion tonight has has shown precisely the point that Bill and Brian both have mentioned, and Michael have both have mentioned And that is that uh uh when you  ask the simple question like uh do you want a united Ireland or do you not want a united Ireland the  the differences in nuances and in opinions and in in the aspirations of what that phrase meant are so great that you can't get a yes or no answer to it And it 's, I think it 's foolish to ask that question The declaration itself has very clearly stated that we have got to in in paragraph one, we 've got to overcome the legacy of history We have got to have a totality of relationships examined Now I think that 's where we have to start It is not simply, do you want an old green-eyed monster like a Nationalist idea of a uh united Ireland or do you want Unionist Orange domination as we had before is that if that 's what means going back to some sort of peace If those are the two alternatives most of us don't want either Uh but uh you know the whole structures uh have to change, uh both North and South The political  feeling in the South for the last number of years has been changing and changing drastically and how we 're hardly able to keep up to pace with it, the fact that this declaration come is a  supreme example of that If Fianna Fa/il had been in government on its own, this declaration would not have been possible, because the tail of Fianna Fa/il would have not allowed that to happen Nor would the Fianna Fa/il party on its own been trusted by the Unionists So there 's development in the South and not here and that is a major problem that we 're going to have to work with\n<$A> Okay  Michael Farrell if it 's a little simplistic perhaps to ask that question, do you or do you not want Irish unity isn't it also very simplistic of people to assume that all Catholics in Northern Ireland are by definition Nationalists Something that probably Protestants here and maybe a lot of people in the South would assume\n<$B> Well that 's that 's uh true that perhaps people haven't seen the complexities of all this and they haven't perhaps seen the complexities of the Unionist side that there are there 're shades of Unionism too Uh but uh I think you come back to the the situation where you have uh, an intolerable situation today in Northern Ireland I think that after twenty-five years people are looking again at the the solution And the old verities are not as as as easily acceptable now Maybe on either side people are realising you 've got to to resolve this problem one way or another, and an attempt is being made now through the the the Downing Street Declaration the Peace Process to uh resolve it and certain uh home truths have been accepted on on all sides or on some of the sides anyway You know on the Nationalist side I think it has been accepted that the Unionists cannot be coerced into a united Ireland and it it would appear from the poll that not all the Catholics want to be in the united Ireland either But equally uh I think it 's implicit in the process though I I would have welcomed a much more explicit recognition by the British government, that the the Nationalists do have grievances that they do have a sense of identity that needs to be recognised and given some institutional form in whatever new arrangements are put in place even if they 're only interim arrangements moving towards a solution and none of us is is sure what the the the final outcome will be\n<$A> Bill Rolston What would be the most important question that could be asked of the people of Northern Ireland or perhaps of the whole island at the moment\n<$C> Uh uh it 's, it 's uh one question but it 's uh it 's a whole Pandora 's box of questions contained in it And I think the the the question is,  what is the Ireland that you want to see I mean even the fifty-two percent who said they wanted a united Ireland, I don't presume that every one of them means the same thing by it Uh, some of them may want, uh have a very secular definition, some may be very conservative et-cetera et-cetera So I think it 's, I think that that that the thing that I would most like to see is much more of a debate about what do these old, well-tried slogans mean They may have meant something in the past and as Mike insinuates here  they they may be changing, and as Brian said too But I would really like to see much more of a debate The trouble is that, very often people are quite scared to debate these things because they feel that uh, that that that the atmosphere is not right for them to say what they really feel, that someone is going to take severe exception to this and and so the debate is stifled before it begins\n<$A> Is it alive down uh in in Fermanagh Brian where you might have neighbours who are either side of an invisible border\n<$D> Uhm yeah, yes uh very much alive in Fermanagh It has been traditionally that kind of place where there 's been a pretty even divide all along the way Uhm I suppose by and large though Fermanagh is the place that brings into focus the kind of new Ireland we 're going to have to look at And that is a situation whereby I think the old economic structures which the economists seem to  be stuck in, I mean Graham Gudgeon 's uh uh way way of looking at things  is certainly outdated uh and and doesn't make much sense at all uh even what he was saying about Germany, and I   he seems to forget that the rest of Europe paid for the urification  of Germany, not just one part of it   Well \n<$A>  But   somebody would have to pay for the unification of Ireland There 's no question about that    either Britain  continues its subvention or somebody makes it up  , or we  all get very poor\n<$D>  Yes yes  \n<$D>  Right but  \n<$D> Uh precisely But but we we we do have to think about new structures, that 's precisely the point I 'm trying to make And we have to think about how come that Northern Ireland the people of all of the people of Northern Ireland generally speaking are divided into rich and poor which is a far greater divide than the rich between than the Protestants and Catholics Now what 's the cause of that How come that a wee  uh uhm  farmer in Fermanagh uh is not uh as well treated as a farmer in in the east of the province, whether he be a Protestant or a Catholic How come that Derry seems to be getting all the factories and wee places like Fermanagh are not getting any How how come, uh how come that  in in a situation of of jobs and and that it 's the people from that part of the province that have to emigrate There 's an economical question here that 's a far bigger thing that has been mystified by this invented border that you talked about\n<$A> Bill Rolston do you think this was just perhaps the case that we 're we 're not ready either for peace or for a united Ireland if that was the eventual outcome cos we haven't explored the questions fully enough\n<$C> Oh yeah The the that may be so but on on the other hand that would be a recipe for for inaction forever if that 's all you believed I think there is a circle here that has to be broken and breaking the circle is going to be painful Uh, and I think that, I I I think that that the point is that that things have to be said, things have to be explored Like for example just to take up something there, uh I don't think that that it necessarily follows that a united Ireland is a poorer Ireland Uh, the banks the trade unions the churches sporting associations the EC everybody believes in cross-border co-operation now, and they must believe that because they feel that it is economically sound Now I don't know it 's been a a, a socialist argument for a lot of years that that a united Ireland with partition out of the way would be a more economically sound Ireland That 's worth exploring\n<$A> Michael Farrell in five seconds would you agree with Bill Rolston\n<$B> I do yes I think first of all there, there has to be a peace dividend if there is peace You know all the money that 's been pumped into the military solution could be pumped into the civil solution I think all economists recognise that uh an all-Ireland economy would make much more sense than a a fragmented economy And I think that  in the end of the day I mean, uh you I come back to an intolerable situation with three thousand plus people   dead, we have to end it \n<$A>  Okay well, we 'll have to leave it there    Okay Michael Farrell in Dublin thanks very much Brian D'arcy Bill Rolston here Thank-you", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Belfast politics>\n\n\n<$A> The talks at Stormont, it looked as though the Ulster Unionists were going to go there with the UDP and the PUP and then this bomb, in Market Hill today Now as I understand it, nobody 's claimed responsibility for this so far but David Trimble of the Ulster Unionists says, kick Sinn Fe/in out of the talks Ulster Unionists here, Dermot Nesbit why if there isn't a claim, why if there isn't a claim would you say, kick Sinn Fe/in out of the talks What 's the point\n<$B> Well the point is very simple We wish to embark upon a process of discussion among constitutional parties to resolve the difficulty in Northern Ireland But before you embark upon a consultative process and discussion we must agree the rules of discussion And we have simply said for one Tony Blair said on Saturday morning that if the IRA or any of the front organisations associated with the IRA was to recommence violence then Sinn Fe/in would be out The Taoiseach also said this week that he was expecting the whole as he I think he said the Republican Family to abide by the preace  process   How \n<$A>  He used the   phrase Republican Movement\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> And that was subsequently queried and there 's a lot of debate now as to whether Sinn Fe/in and the IRA are part of the Republican Movement\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> The terminology now is Republican Family\n<$B> Yes   Republican Movement or  Republican Family\n<$A>  But the or  \n<$A> Yeah to get back to the main point A bomb went off today Nobody 's claimed it and you say kick Sinn Fe/in out   In  the sentence why\n<$B>  The  \n<$B> The precise process is that we have lodged that Sinn Fe/in should be removed The Chairman of the talks process will then ask the various parties for their opinion The Government will then have to make up their mind And I repeat what Tony Blair has said that if the IRA or any of the front organisation has carried out any act of violence and I think no-one here doubts, that it is not someone from the Republic Movement It was a very large bomb The Chief Constable said it was done with great expertise and very, detailed planning   so one  does not doubt that\n<$A>  Mm okay  \n<$A> Right we 'll come back to it Gentleman beside you just two along Yes sir\n<$C> Well, I come from outside Lisburn The question I would like to ask if given the opportunity  is, can our politicians handle the peace, or are we going to have to suffer their negativity, their play on semantics and their inability, to negotiate on a group to group basis\n<$A> Yeah but what about the point that the Unionists make, and it 's also been made perhaps with greater force by the UK Unionist party the DUP you cannot go in and you cannot negotiate with people who are either terrorists or friends of terrorists\n<$C> But sure   the  \n<$A>  Do you   not believe that\n<$C> Sure the Unionists have been doing this\n<$A> How have they been doing it   Explain \n<$C>  Well they 've been   doing it with the the the two small, uh fringe Loyalist parties Uh the uh leader of their party, fraternised with persons in Portadown of of uhm, dubious\n<$A> I think the word you 're looking for is hypocrisy  Is that the   word you 're looking  for Right one second Mo Uh this gentleman here is that yes sir\n<$C>  Yes yes  \n<$D> Andy Frew Green Party I think we should recognise that there 's fragmentation on the Loyalist side and on the Republican side But the question I would like to have answered is can the unionists agree to share power with Catholics and Nationalists or, will they have the British impose a solution with in consultation with the   Irish government \n<$A>  You think that 's a   possibility\n<$D> I think we have to look to an end-game here instead of shilly-shallying about with with these issues We shouldn't leave a veto in this process to the last five eejits with some explosives\n<$A> Alright This lady\n<$E> I don't think that I 'm from the Ulster Unionist Party as well David that shilly-shallying about is what we would see as happening today Today was a very serious day for us We were trying to look at this process in a in a in a positive manner And I think for people to say that we 've been negative about this process is just wrong because we have been criticised for being positive about this process And we have to take David is uh David Trimble is taking this slowly and I think he has every right to take it slowly given what we have suffered this past thirty years\n<$A> But you see the gentleman over here wants to know how come the Unionists can do business, with the Loyalists\n<$E> Well for a start-off the Loyalists have now had a three-year cease fire and I know you 're now   going to say \n<$A>  With with   yes I 'm going to tell you there has been the odd very serious blip\n<$E> There has indeed but  can I say that they have signed up to the Mitchell principles and there 's been no shilly-shallying about that And can I also say that they had abject remorse for what they have done over the past years something which the IRA Sinn Fe/in movement have not been able to do\n<$A> Yeah I I I don't know uhm I 'm going to come to this gentleman over here because I I 'm not sure now I talked to David Ervine and Gary McMichael today in Talkback I 'm not sure I know, what was affirmed on behalf of whom, because David Ervine said to me today I think he used the term there there was an assumption, that the UVF were signing up to those I 'm not sure, I got clarification to the point that I could say to you oh yes they did What were you going to say sir\n<$F> Well David I was just going to say uhm it 's a pity that such an ambitious programme is starting by looking back Now it 's a long way to May There 're going to be   obstacles There 're going to be obstacles \n<$A>  No I don't I don't    Now   come  on sir   you  cannot say that We had the opening of talks at Stormont There is a big bomb in Market   Hill  today and if you think we can walk away and leave that well I 'm   sorry  you 've got the wrong guy\n<$F>  Sir  \n<$F>  No  \n<$F>  Right  \n<$F>  No  \n<$F> I no I the point I 'm making is we have a commitment to a timetable which leads us to  to May There 're going to be many people try to derail the Peace Process and the democratic process and is this will test the commitment of everybody politicians and community people alike And we really have got to steel ourselves for being put under pressure from all directions\n<$A> And you say that despite what happened today that all the parties should get in there and talk\n<$F> In spite of it\n<$A> In spite of   it  Okay yes sir\n<$F>  Yes  \n<$G> I 'm just I 'm very disappointed in the Unionists ' response It 's something we 've been listening to from day one of the Peace Process They seem, unwilling to to engage with other people And and I I have wondered why they 're so frightened of peace because that 's the objective of the talks   to arrive at peace \n<$A>  What view would you what general  , view would you hold Where would your support be\n<$G> I 'd be a Republican   sympathiser \n<$A>  You 'd be   Republican\n<$G> Yeah\n<$A> A Republican sympathiser So what are you saying that that that the Unionists are just simply trying to shy away from talking to  It 's as simple as that\n<$G> I think it 's more than that I think they fear that for the fifty years that they had complete control of this State, when they abused power and that 's it 's historical fact It 's no longer a debating point\n<$E> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$G> But well you can come back in on that later Let me make the point They abused the power they had for fifty years They now seem to have this oh if if anybody else is in control what 'll happen to us I don't want that happening I 'd want an equality I think that should happen before negotiations that all people should have the same rights And that 's something this State still has to deal with   the question  of equality\n<$A>  Yeah it 's something  \n<$A> It it 's uhm I mean we 'll may get into it in a moment or two and I I I don't uh because Arlene I think you want to come back briefly to answer that But you we could get into a sticky area about consent, and what people understand by consent And there are about three different versions of that Yes you uh briefly Arlene\n<$E> I just wanted to say that again we 're being attacked for being negative but it it 's our party that is putting forward the adoption of the European Convention on Human Rights into this country And I just want to make that point clear to everybody\n<$A> Okay would you would you hold on I 'll come back to you on this side because I am deserting the good people who are over on this side And I 'm just going to talk to a couple of ladies here and I 'll be up with you in a second or two Yes\n<$H> Okay I 'm Brenda Callaghan from the Northern Ireland Women 's Coalition And while today was obviously very disappointing and I think a lot of people have been hurt by what happened in Market Hill I think the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland are keen to see some sort of political process and progress And therefore the only way to do that is actually to get in and let 's start talking And I think that 's the message that 's coming across from everywhere People are urging the Unionist Family to take some risks for progress and to actually get in there It 's not good enough to be hanging around their headquarters saying should we or shouldn't we They have a responsibility to the people they represent to get in there and make their voice heard in the way all the other parties who have an electoral mandate whether they like it or don't have a right to have their voices heard as well\n<$A> Okay let 's have a view from the reverend gentleman there from Newtownabbey Yes sir what\n<$I> The speaker two before who referred to himself as a Republican sympathiser is he prepared  to condemn the bomb in Market Hill We 've heard no condemnation, from the Sinn Fe/in Republican movement of that bomb uh in in Market Hill taking   place \n<$A>  Right   what is your position on the bomb in Market Hill\n<$G> If I thought it would stop it I would certainly condemn it Does that answer   you We 've had twenty-seven years of condemnation and it has achieved  absolutely nothing If my condemnation could stop the   whole thing, I could do it I 'm not speaking of Sinn Fe/in \n<$I>  But why don't you condemn it now  Why, why do you condemn  \n<$I>  But Sinn Fe/in have got to show, Sinn Fe/in have got to show that they   are now in favour of peace   And  they 've got to show the same condemnation of any acts of violence from whatever quarter they come from and   I 'd I 'm  happy to see them in the talks   I 'm happy to \n<$I>  But but  \n<$I>  It 's  \n<$G>  But condemnation   didn't change anything", "subdomain":

{"text": "<Orange Order>\n\n\n<$A> Some have a great day out to watch the parades and listen to the bands, but for others at best a non-event, at worst an offence to what they hold dear, and for all of us a public holiday So today I want to explore the Orange Order It is a body that engenders passions, for and against by its very aims and objectives, which can be summarised as to uphold the interests of Protestantism throughout the world That might be unremarkable enough, except that in this province with its history its divisions its deep wounds and hurts, anything that vigorously upholds one side, is likely to offend the other Many Orangemen however, would sincerely declare that their Order is maligned and misunderstood It 's not disruptive divisive or even anti-Catholic It should be as normal a part of Ulster life as any friendly society The question I pose today is, is it possible in Northern Ireland to hold an intelligent conversation about the Orange Order That is to express viewpoints for and against with reason, and knowledge and tolerance, to accept criticism, perhaps be modified by it and at the end peacefully to accept our differences My guests are I think intelligent and informed I look to them to help us find an answer They are Clifford Smyth Orangeman and historian, Maurice Hayes former  Ombudsman and Down GAA  Secretary, Rhonda Paisley artist and former DUP councillor, Duncan Morrow lecturer on politics and writer on community relations, and in our Radio Foyle studio, Dennis Haughey SDLP International Secretary Clifford Smyth, do you think as a committed Orangeman that it is possible to talk about this subject without being influenced by our bias\n<$B> Well each of us comes to a particular, situation or circumstance or indeed institution like the Orange Order, uh with certain preconceptions or presuppositions, and so uh I 've yet to meet the person who can say I am not biased We all have some kind of, of perception of things But perhaps the way into this if we 're in determined to have an intelligent discussion and I uh hope we do, is uh a remark that was made to me some years ago which I have pondered over since by Professor John White He was the gentleman who invited me to do, the thesis on uh, Dr Paisley And in general conversation uh about Northern Ireland he said one of the difficulties Clifford, that makes our problems so intense is that we have two lines of cleavage in Ulster not just one He said in Europe people have lines of cleavage over nationality or over religion, but he said in Ireland we have two lines of cleavage bosh   both nationality and religion And the Orange Order manifests, uh  uh and expresses our, that is the Protestant and British position here in Ireland Uh it manifests it in the form of uh uh religion and to an extent politics but these are matters which we will discuss further\n<$A> Denis Haughey you 're outside of this entirely so, I mean how do you come to this Do you come to it with a bias or do you come to it without knowing a great deal about it\n<$C> Well I don't know a great deal about Orangeism but uh I don't really think that it 's possible to uh, to have an unbiased opinion I I always suspect people who proclaim their lack of bias Uhm it 's it 's it uh everything that you perceive you perceive it against the background of your own, experience your own thinking your own beliefs, and uh how you see things is tends to be coloured by that But I think it is possible to be, uh rational about it and uh to uh discuss uh the question  without giving way to, uh one 's   bias  But uh to suggest that uh it is possible to be absolutely free of bias I think is\n<$A>  Right  \n<$A> Rhonda would you agree with these two  that the baggage that we bring to us from our conditioning our context our past uh is not so influential as to stop us having an intelligent conversation, and hopefully also a good relationship\n<$D> Well I would take the opinion that Dennis Haughey isn't the only one outside this There are far more Loyalists in Northern Ireland outside the Orange Order and outside, all the trappings of the Twelfth, than are inside it So I would very much say that I was also outside it because I 've never been involved in the Twelfth as far as uh membership of   anything goes \n<$B>  It 's it 's not   entirely a male sexist organisation though I understand   there are women in it \n<$D>  Well it may as   well be because I mean  the women are more like bunny girls They don't really do anything very effective   within  the Orange Order do they\n<$B>  Well the  \n<$A> I wonder would they be flattered to be called bunny girls   or insulted \n<$D>  Well they   probably would be \n<$A> Duncan\n<$B> It 's not my experience I must say that they are bunny girls \n<$A> That oh I 'm not going to identify that voice at all \n<$B> My wife is going to hit me over the head over this one\n<$A> Duncan\n<$E> I think it is clearly true that uh not everybody has a direct experience of the Orange Order from within, but it would be difficult in Northern Ireland not to have had, some sense of or some experience of the order in its public performance, and at that level I suppose we all have our experiences An intelligent conversation I suppose depends on the respect we give the validity of those perceptions of one another, and don't in a one sense or another see them as simply competitive but see them as really held perceptions and how we deal with those is the point\n<$A> Duncan used the word competitive there and, Maurice Hayes you have been secretary of a branch of the GAA, and I suppose in public perception some people would see the GAA, as not being exactly the other side of the coin from the Orange Order but at least certainly in competition\n<$F> I I I wouldn't have thought so except that they 're both extremely conservative organisations, and uh conservative organisations generally find it hard to take criticism or scrutiny, from either outside or or within so I I suppose they have that much in in in common Uhm, uh to go back to the, initial point that that you raised yes I I think we all do bring our, biases with us Uh I think the effort we have to make is, to recognise that it is a baggage, and and to try and sort of strip as much of that away from from ourselves before we we start looking at at at other people I I think you looked at from the the outside, uhm the uhm, Orange Order uh seems to me to have five or six personae uh you know three or four of which are are actually, uh very laudable   and uh extremely Well one or two  mightn't be, just as much and I think uh, uh the uhm, those are the things I think we 'll   be teasing out \n<$A>  Well some of those which are enjoyable  \n<$A>  I I wouldn't   I wouldn't to have a six point sermon starting right now Maurice so could we   go on  maybe to the next   thing  Any intelligent conversation I think we would agree, must be based on fact as far as possible And facts about the Orange Order are very likely to be  coloured So I invited Jonathon Bardon whose recent History of Ulster, contained a section on the Order, to guide us through the roots and establishment, and spread of Orangeism But first I asked him, was he without bias\n<$F>  Sure  \n<$F>  Uh-huh  \n<$G> The job of the historian is to try to find out just what happened try to provide some explanation uh, of course the historian has to make judgements, but those judgements are, uh based, on uh  what he or she observes\n<$A> Now sources I  mean what what sources can you use for history of Orangeism Are they not largely, from within Orangeism itself and therefore would be giving, some kind of uh, biased account to begin with\n<$G> Yes certainly uh,  on on the other hand you could argue that uh perhaps the Orange Order uh   could release a lot more of its papers uh to to to uh make it possible for more extensive studies to be made But uh, the government particularly in the nineteenth century was very paper-minded, uh producing enormous reports on the Orange Order for example in eighteen thirty-five volumes and volumes of the stuff And then any time there were riots in Belfast for example, uh there tended to be royal commissions of inquiry which again produced maps and volumes and uh evidence from, various Grand   Masters  The sources are there plus uhm, the newspaper accounts of Orange activities are extremely detailed I mean we who read uhm tabloids today have no idea of just the the amount of print that you could get through uhm\n<$A>  Although  \n<$A> Now I suspect that a great number of people listening to us this morning\n\n<$G> Of William who is the the ruler of Holland who eventually became uh uh the the King of England  with his wife   Mary \n<$C>  Did you   say the south of France   or, Well now I mean you 're  now talking to one ignoramus because I always thought that Orange had to do with uh Holland, but it has to do with the south of France\n<$G>  Yes It 's <&French> Orange </&French>  \n<$G> Well it has to do  with   with Holland in in that uh the ruler of Holland uh possessed this piece of land in the south of France\n<$C> Well I interrupted you because   I  couldn't let that go I mean this was so uh  intriguing to   me  But can can you go on with your story now\n<$G>  Yes  \n<$G>  Yes  \n<$G> Yes and of course uh when King James the Second uh came with French soldiers, to uh try to recover his English throne, uh and uh, uhm, upset  effectively the Ulster Plantation, naturally the the Ulster Protestant settlers, were uh indebted to William of Orange who had uh saved them at the Boyne and subsequently uh at uh, the Battle of Aughrim which incidentally is the battle fought on the twelfth of July since the battle of the Boyne was fought on the first of July But uh the forming of the Orange Order goes, uh forward to the seventeen nineties and then we must go to County Armagh where there were ferocious sectarian struggles between, the Peep-O'-Day Boys, who were Protestant weavers who got up at the crack of dawn, and attacked their Catholic neighbours, and the Defenders these were Catholics, who they would uh defend their homes and their looms where they were in a minority and they would be, uh taking an offensive approach, uh uh particularly in South Armagh where they were in a majority And these these uhm, struggles became so severe, uh that uh quite uh uh extensive uhm, fights took place uh various gentlemen and priests and clergy tried to separate the the warring uh factions And uh, eventually, a a kind of truce was arranged uh between gentlemen and a Catholic priest in in north County Armagh in September of seventeen ninety-five But a contingent of Catholic Defenders coming from County Tyrone didn't hear about the truce, and they came ready to take on the Protestant Peep-O'-Day Boys This was proof that the truce had been broken and a a battle took place, uh at the Diamond in North Armagh, and the Protestants won triumphantly, uh killing at least thirty perhaps as many as fifty of the Catholic Defenders And the triumphant Protestants then went off uh and uh to Lough Gall nearby and there they founded uh the Orange Society or the Orange Order\n<$A> So this was very much then of the people I mean this sounds like to be of of very much the working-class people they and without real leadership from the top", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e2bd09fd-c608-4b3b-8024-709582f09637", "added":

{"text": "<Trade unions>\n\n\n<$A> Well there are few subjects more emotive than fair employment and our panel tonight are passionate in their beliefs, both for and against In Derry Gregory Campbell of the DUP He 's against the current system Here in Belfast, Tom Gillan of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions He 's for the principle at least And very much for both principle and current practice is Bob Cooper, chairman of the Fair Employment Commission and before that head of its predecessor, The Fair Employment Agency Now Bob Cooper, a lot of our audience would be most interested in one specific and that is the case pending against the FEC itself Can you comment on that\n<$B> No I couldn't comment on any matter that 's sub-judice\n<$A> So that 's that   Until  it 's resolved  , there 's  nothing to be said Okay Tom Gillan in the report we heard uh the union representative talking about public bodies and the and the fact that the public don't get all the information, Use this opportunity to put your case to Bob Cooper\n<$B>  That 's that  \n<$B>  That 's right </2> \n<$C> Well it 's not just to put to Bob Cooper, it 's to put it to government and to those bodies themselves who would uh enter into confidentiality clauses and to anyone who would want to do that It 's in the public interest that all organisations whether they be public sector bodies or private sector bodies breach the law, It 's in the public interest that the people know that they did that, that they know how they did it, uh how that was allowed to happen Were their procedures wrong We need to know how much money 's been spent on that just not only to the person who was discriminated against, how much was paid to solicitors We need to get answers to all of those questions so that we can stop it happening again\n<$A> Is that not reasonable Bob Cooper\n<$B> Absolutely I can understand that entirely and as far as we are concerned we 're opposed to confidentiality clauses and settlements particularly when it involves uh the public sector Uh we think that the public has a right to know uh where their money 's being spent\n<$A> Because it 's public money\n<$B> Because it 's public money Exactly\n<$A> Well, you know Gregory Campbell and you know he 's a critic of yours But Gregory Campbell in the report the the point is made, Protestants use the Fair Employment Commission as well as Catholics Where else could they go if it wasn't for the FEC\n<$D> Well yes they do uh Mike and I heavily recommend that they should do so Unfortunately it has taken uh a large number of years now from the initial uh Fair Employment Agency where there was  resentment and opposition to the way the uh Bob Cooper and the old agency was carrying out the functions Now the Commission has been uh in vogue for several years and uh the opposition isn't lessening But what people are doing is they are seeing that there is no other alternative agency to which they can go in order to have their grievance aired and to try and get some uh redress and and there are those who have uh  received redress both monetary and uh uh public redress uh but  they find that there 's no other option They have to go to an  a a company, an organisation which they resent uh because of the practice uh but they find that they have no alternative They simply have to go state their case and hope that they get a fair hearing\n<$A> So you 're saying they go almost by default But could I put it to you this point, I mean  is it not perhaps a case of attitude and perhaps a particularly Protestant attitude that if it if it 's post-Stormont, you don't like it\n<$D> No it 's not that at all You see  what is happening in Northern Ireland is and I 've drawn attention to this uh uh both uh privately with Mr Cooper and publicly many times What you have, particularly in public bodies you have a massive recruitment campaign of Roman Catholics to the disadvantage of Protestants Uh and the Health Boards have been mentioned I 'm not mentioning any individual one But if you take the Health Boards as an example globally in Northern Ireland they employ over forty thousand people And three out of the four or them have an imbalance of Catholic recruits Uh  that is happening over and over and over again to detriment of Protestants Where you get Protestant minorities in other companies, they 're such a tiny minority that they are very very fearful of taking any case of uh intimidation or harassment in the workplace because they may be the only Protestant employee in the entire company   Where you  get Catholic uh minorities you usually find that the Catholic minority is quite small but is growing substantially because of the recruitment policy\n<$A>  Bob Cooper  \n<$A> Bob Cooper would you accept that in the public perception you are you are there basically to serve Catholics\n<$B> Uh I would accept that in the public perception the reason why the Fair Employment Commission was established was of because of the big discrepancy uh in employment and unemployment as far as Catholics were concerned Uh and that still remains And it still remains the situation that whereas uh uh there still is uh an improvement in the situation Uh about forty-one percent or so of those being recruited are Catholic which does not suggest that there is massive recruitment of Catholics going on That 's roughly the figure which one would expect to find Uhm it might be marginally actually bearing in mind the age factor, marginally lower than one would wish to see Uh but there is no evidence of massive uh reverse discrimination in favour of Catholics or anything like that, uh quite the reverse\n<$A> Gregory Campbell\n<$D> No uhm  I mean Bob is flying in the face of his own figures I mean he knows very well and I don't need nor won't uh name the individual companies but he knows that there are large concerns all across Northern Ireland where it is very difficult to find any Protestants employed And you can't find one large company in Northern Ireland that have no Catholics  that is a fact that is presently uh giving the Fair Employment Commission uh some headache because people like me are raising the issue but I don't see that, that they have actually done anything about it And you see when you get companies large companies with hundreds of employees and and say one or two Protestants, those people are going to keep their heads down, they 're not going to say anything if there 's any abuse heaped on them, they 're just going to say well I 've got to mind my own business, get get on with my work and go home keep me head down But on the other hand where you get Catholic minorities uh in uh  predominantly in the east of the Bann they are a burgeoning minority And   I mean  the figures of Bob Cooper 's monitoring report show that He can't really deny his own figures\n<$?>  See  \n<$A> Is that the way you see it Tom Gillan\n<$C> Well,  the issue is this that we want everyone to live, in peace in this community We want everyone to have an equal opportunity for a job and an equal opportunity to progress in that job And we in the trade union movement through counteracting through our own unions have encouraged people not to put their head down, not to say that that they 're that that they 're frightened, not to walk away from any, any fear  of intimidation or or threat that they face from their fellow employees, that go first of all to their shop steward to their to their  to their foreman or whoever it happens to be and say, this is happening And we have structures there to ensure that we can do everything and anything we can to to support those people And it 's a very traumatic experience for anyone who has faced intimidation or has been discriminated against We want this to stop There 's it 's not just  the money doesn't pay for this If you have been uhm, discriminated against the money you get in your pocket doesn't do anything for the lost opportunity, it doesn't do anything for your self-esteem, it doesn't do anything for our reputation as a community within ourselves or internationally and we need to stop it The the FEC you know is there, it 's made up of people from both sides of industry and from the community and it 'll have to work And we all want to work in it together And let 's sit down and talk about how we could make it better\n<$A> Bob Cooper you have been basically Mr Fair Employment since the year dot right through from the FEA to the FEC Over these years has it been helpful do you think\n<$B> Yes absolutely Uh and emphasising again the point that whereas uh all the evidence would suggest that the position of Catholics is improving uh at a slowish rate but it 's still improving But there still is a quite a long way to go Uh the legislation would be being reviewed next year and uh the question will be uh whether it has done enough uh or whether the discrepancy has been uh narrowed sufficiently\n<$A> What I what I wonder about is is, tackling fair employment, as an issue without looking at segregated housing which is basically the way it is in this country and and segregated education and in Derry Gregory Campbell that would be very much the case wouldn't it in terms of housing Or that 's the way you would see it\n<$D> Yes Well it it 's a fact unfortunately We we did have a position probably twenty thirty years ago uh where there was a a reasonable degree  of mixing and socialising uh uh housing and employment But because of the violence and the Troubles uh of course the the communities have polarised Uh you 're always going to get an increasing difficulty where you get people being pushed to the margin pushed aside Uh you you 're going to get  that difficulty which is very hard to overcome   But,  what you 've got to do is you 've got to try and establish the underlying principle and that principle has got to be merit Only merit The person best suited to the job is the person that gets the job   Unfortunately that \n<$A>  Okay  \n<$A>  And <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> do you guarantee   merit\n<$B> Yes that that is exactly the principle of course of the fair employment legislation There should be fair participation for both   communities \n<$D>  It doesn't sound   like that\n<$B> But at the point of selection uh it should be merit Uh on the point of the the the segregation I entirely accept the point you 're making except that one has to work  along different ways\n<$A> Tom Gillan I 'll give you the final word\n<$C> Well I I I I think yes merit is  is the issue We want our politicians to sit down and give us all something to  live for and to work together for We want structures, we want democracy in our own community and we want peace And that, if the people would sit down around the table and talk together we can do something about all of this which will bring, the need for the FEC et-cetera to to go away\n<$A> Tom Gillan and Bob Cooper in Belfast, Gregory

{"text": "<Principles>\n\n\n<$A> Frances can I ask you, has everyone got the right to their own opinion\n<$B> I believe everybody do has uh has the right to their own opinions but when it comes to actually having actions on those opinions and trying to enforce them on other people then you do get a lot of complications with the opinions\n<$A> Is that the distinction Uh Edward you were nodding to that\n<$C> Oh well I would most firmly agree Uh no-one has the right to uh force their opinions on another person especially as they 're often unproven, and have no substance in scientific fact or reality such as the health fascist groups\n<$A> Right\n<$C> Anti-smoking ASH et-cetera\n<$A> Now we will come to them in a moment Packie can I ask you does anyone have the right to enforce their opinions on others\n<$D> I believe people are entitled to their own point of view certainly and their own opinion But it 's when  they expect other people to have the same view as themselves and I think that 's a problem here in Northern Ireland People expect people to believe what they believe And if you don't then you 're seen as different\n<$A> Yeah Isn't this one of the problems though that sometimes there 's a conflict because what you believe in may prevent someone else from believing in what they hold to be true Andrew Puddephat  where does where does Liberalism uh draw that distinction\n<$E>  Well the right to hold your own beliefs and own opinions is one of the most profound liberal democratic values that goes back several hundred years And I think the the limit comes when you seek to impose those views on others and in the exercise of your own personal belief seek to restrict the rights of other people to hold their own opinions And that 's the limit The  the limits of my right to have my own opinion uh begins that the end of that is where it begins to impinge on someone else 's rights And therefore that 's the test I think one has to apply \n<$A> Graham do you do you share what uh Andrew Puddephat 's just said\n<$F> I don't think we can make windows into men 's hearts as Queen Elizabeth the First said and that would be my opinion We can't we can't make people think how they how we would want them to think\n<$A> Gerry what do you think We can't make people think\n<$G>   Well I  first of all it 's important to have conviction Uh  the best lacking all conviction and the worst full of passionate intensity  was the observation made by Yeats We  we have to have personal beliefs We have to have convictions The point hinges on how we use those opinions to alter the lives of others I like to think of conviction as being mainly private that they they would drive me but they wouldn't necessarily upset other people\n<$A>  <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>  \n<$A> Yeah Uh Edward uh Nesbit can I come to you Uhm you mentioned earlier about health fascists\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> Uh why do you have a problem with health fascists\n<$C> Well because health fascists are engaged in a crusade of persecution against those who exercise their absolutely legal right to smoke They do this on a totally unscientific and absolutely unproven basis   And if by my , well I call them fascists because   they  think like fascists they act like fascists they talk like fascists so presumably they are fascists\n<$A>  Why do you call them fascists  \n<$A>  Now if you  \n<$A> Right well we 've got someone who beside you who 'd probably take issue with being called a fascist I don't know what you how you 'd call yourself on this\n<$H> Well I certainly would refute the fact that I I am seen as a fascist I work every day in an organisation The Ulster Cancer Foundation that works uh in both trying to put forward the facts of smoking And I don't believe our listeners this evening have any  uh difficulty in accepting the fact that smoking in this community is dangerous\n<$A> But what would you try and do with the knowledge you say that you have about smoking Would you try and ban it in public places Ban it on   uh uh  the underground or or in trains\n<$?>  Ban it on the yeah  \n<$H> Yes I I believe that uh there are places that smoking should be banned But I do believe that adults individual adults have a right to smoke if they  so decide But I do think that there are some people in the community that need protected If it was an opinion to smoke that was not dangerous but I 'm thinking at the moment of children and smoking I think our children do have a right to be protected and to be taught and educated   about smoking \n<$A>  Did did   Edward do you do you need to be protected\n<$C> Sorry   No no I  am an adult and I am perfectly capable deciding what I shall do And I don't see that anyone has the right to seek to prevent me from doing or to engage in such activities as to uh constructively deny me the right to attend the cinema constructively deny me the right to earn a living which is what these intolerant fanatics are about\n<$A>  Do you need to be protected  \n<$A> Right Uhm Myc Riggulsford,   what 's your view on this\n<$I>  We should educate people about the things that are going to happen to them if they smoke and the chances of getting cancer Now you can then decide on the basis of the  that information whether you want to take that risk or not And that 's up to you \n<$A> Pastor McKee uh uh do you think this is a matter where we ought to compromise as a society\n<$J> I think that the answer really is not to to ban smoking uh altogether The answer is to uhm cause the smokers to uh recognise that we have uh an opinion as well They are entitled to smoke yes But if that opinion is going to uh affect my lifestyle and damage me then they 're not entitled to that opinion\n<$A> Is this the dilemma then for us again if it  affects other people then it 's something that we ought to as a whole look for\n<$C> I would just like to quote something from uh, The  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the United States Now this bear in mind is not a <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> group This is a health fascist organisation who are trying to ban smoking virtually everywhere including the street  We recognise that there is no epidemiological data about workplace ETS  but we don't feel it 's necessary to wait for them  And that is their so called proof\n<$A> Right now Wilson\n<$K> The issue here  and that seems to be, the issue that seems to be uhm coming to the fore here is precisely how far we as a society are willing to put ourselves in danger in order to defend the individual liberties of others I personally feel that uh the individual liberty of another to smoke is worth whatever risk I may be putting myself in by sitting in a room with that person   I  think that individual liberties are more important than the  infinitesimal risk from passive smoking\n<$?>  Yes  \n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> Is that is that the ultimate dilemma then how far the freedom of the individual can be  reconciled with the rights of that individual to harm himself or others Do you do you accept that   Paul \n<$R>   Yeah that 's   John Stuart Mill 's principle of liberty that we should be free to do what we like ourselves providing we don't infringe the liberties,   or  happiness or health of other people That 's that 's fair   you know  \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Right   On health grounds you you smoke\n<$R>  I smoke yes   yeah  \n<$A>  But   do you eat meat for instance\n<$R>  I 'm keeping away from beef at the moment until they identify the little beasts that 's causing the mad cow disease yeah But if it 's in the milk we we 've had it anyway   I think \n<$A>  Okay yeah   Does everyone have a right though to eat meat Some people might believe that it 's morally wrong to uh to kill animals and to eat them Vivienne what what do you think\n<$L>  Uhm the animal uhm killing business is very cruel It and it 's very often been muted that if people had to kill, their own food for the table uh there would be vastly more vegetarians in the world \n<$A> What do you say though to those people in the animal rights movement who uhm set fire to the laboratories for instance or they attack farms and they uhm try and prevent people from from from uh actually processing meat\n<$L>  I can understand it 's just frustration \n<$A> You can understand their frustration\n<$L>  Yeah I 'm I 'm not advocating it 's right or wrong I can say I can understand people feeling so passionately like the gentleman here at the front I mean whether we agree or disagree is neither here nor there but you passionately feel these things I can understand their frustration \n<$A> And  what is the  dilemma Can I ask you Brian\n<$M>  Well I think uh animals well probably most of them were there before we came on earth or evolved were there and they 've got equal rights to us yes \n<$A> So how does that reflect itself on on how you view people who try and stop people from eating meat Do you agree with it or disagree with it\n<$M>  Uh I, well I would go even further because I 'm a vegan of thirty years standing and I don't wear or use anything of animal origin And what I 'm  trying to say rather than forcing people is say well, we have examples going back three generations of vegans who are living quite healthily, and they are frugivores which all of us are by nature We do not need to eat meat to live healthily \n<$A> You you 're a  meat-eater Myc  what 's your   view on this \n<$I>   Yes yes   I I I think that 's uh uh a very good point of view I would I would fight forever for the right for people not to have to eat meat if they don't want to eat meat But on the other hand I don't think the vegans should be out there uhm causing damage to people who do And I don't believe the vegans do for that very reason They 're you know peaceful people who 've decided they 're not going to harm other people \n<$A> But don't we have a dilemma here If we believe that animals are equal to people in terms of their rights surely then we can't kill and eat them\n<$N>  Yes I think uh  very logical really because we love animals in so many uh areas with our pets but then all this murder is  uh created in order to eat animals and I think uh every animal has its right to life  its life is valuable to it in the way that ours is And I don't think the human race has the right to take   animal life  \n<$A>  So then we   so then we ought to prevent those who seek to try and kill and process and eat meat\n<$N>  Uhm well I think just with the er example perhaps and and and spreading knowledge about uh alternative ways of living that we don't need to kill animals that uhm animal animals are are beautiful creatures   and  deserve their life \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A> Now we have uh in the audience you you 're a farmer Graham uh Craig as I understand it Uhm what 's your view to the to the uh uh uh well uh expression of of outrage that animals ought to be killed\n<$O> Uh I 'm a farmer I produce both meat uh and uh milk and mutton And I would just like to  make one point first There have been attacks on butchers in the east and north Down regions and when I worked in the Farmers ' Union there were numerous cases  came to us of such attacks As regards animals having rights animals do not have rights since they have don't have souls Uh they can't think for themselves However, we as farmers and human beings have responsibilities to raise animals in the most humane way possible\n<$A> Well why is there a distinction drawn for instance between battering a seal or a a cuddly animal and standing on a beetle Why if this is a moral absolute is there any difference at all Uhm Connor you 've got your your hand up again\n<$P> I think that there is a lack of recognition nowadays that, every animal no matter what size it is, is capable of feeling, every feeling and emotion that humans can And uh he 's saying over there that animals have no rights because they don't have a soul I don't know what on earth that 's meant to mean But that 's it was that kind of argument that was used during the black slave trade and now look at the way we 're looking at it And I think there is an advancement of what people think of uh animals and uh, the situation should improve\n<$A> Vivienne what what do you think\n<$L>  Well I think uh Graham is it uh lives in the Dark Ages I think it 's time he realised there 's a great swell of public opinion Animals do have rights Animals the important issue as Connor said there they have feelings They feel pain They feel emotions They feel love hate everything that we feel And I think it 's time we actually moved out of the Dark Ages and went with the tide of conviction that people feel these days \n<$A> But what do you think about uh Graham 's conviction Is he not entitled to hold it\n<$L>  Of course he is but I think it 's slightly antiquated and I think it 's time he knows \n<$Q> Can I also say that nine times out of ten I would say animals are far more uh,\n<$A> You going to say nicer than people\n<$Q> Yeah educated far better than people I mean they know more they 're more uhm they say they say a year-old calf for instance knows more than six-week-old baby\n<$A> Right\n<$Q> To me I think animals have more brains than humans,   some of them \n<$A>  If they have   if they have more brains and and they have a a personality uh Vivienne why why do you we as a society allow uhm experimentation on them", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "361cc1cd-bb67-4e7c-ab2a-1558131a346b",

was mentioned there the O'Neills you 'd come across a lot of people like that Now what are you looking for this peace dividend  what are you searching for\n<$B> I have come across a lot of Danny O'Neills in my time People who, in other circumstances would would have very very good prospects facing them Uh and there is an inescapable, difficulty here between, between, unemployment and segregation and the violence But I think in west Belfast we have had this unemployment, which has long pre-dated the Troubles And in fact there has been bad governance there, and bad governance in the economic policies, which are running Northern Ireland for more than seventy years even pre-dating partition And I think that we have to create a society which, while, if it gives equity it also has economic growth And we have instead concentrated here in building up strong public sectors and really not giving enough decisions to people on the ground and especially not allowing a situation where private investment can come  can come in here  we have a situation at the moment where about thirty-six percent of the population of Northern Ireland is in the public sector That is a very unhealthy situation   I \n<$A>  People   have talked about a a dependency culture in some quarters Do you think that exists\n<$B> I  I think people make rational decisions I 'd be very very loath indeed to criticise people Uhm I see a lot of pride and self-respect but I also see people on the streets in West Belfast who have never got a chance, to make a mark in life And that is not always an accident It is the circumstances and the structures of society which which uh which have actually created that condition for them And those structures have to change\n<$A> Martin Donegan the Research Centre 's uh prognosis was quite depressing Uh  do you go along with that theory that maybe this peace dividend isn't all it 's cracked up to be\n<$C> Think the most important peace dividend we have had is that nobody 's getting killed And I think in a sense depressing and all as this economic discussion is, it is still healthy to have it And I 'm pleased to have it I 'm sure the participants are I believe it 's even worse than that I mean Eamon touched on something which is very very important We shouldn't give the people of Northern Ireland the impression that we may return to a golden age There never was a golden age in Northern Ireland Uh Eamon refers specifically to West Belfast but the decline in the old traditional industries has made meant that long-term massive unemployment has spread right across North Belfast right across all areas all religions Uhm, if there 's one thing we must do is develop short medium long-term strategies Graham is dealing with what is more of a medium-term situation The short-term situation must be that the government must say number one, they will maintain public expenditure at whatever level is needed at whatever level is needed to secure the peace Number two they must say that we will eradicate generation inter-generational long-term unemployment and we will do it now\n<$A> That 's a very big phrase \" eradicate long-term unemployment \" I mean they 've been trying to do that not just in Northern Ireland but in all sorts of other urban areas where the old industries have been in decline What 've we got here that uh can can get us out of that syndrome do you think\n<$C> I think, I mean, the development authorities and the the development debate will take place and take place over a period of time There is nothing wrong in I don't need a conservative MP from England sounding like an ideological foghorn across the Irish Sea, telling us that at this most important time in the history of this island, we have to behave like Thatcherites and ideologues There 's nothing wrong with saying, we will expand something like Enterprise Ulster and we will absorb eight or nine thousand  unemployed people I mean, do the people of   Northern Ireland realise that half of the unemployed in Northern Ireland haven't had a job in over a year There 's twenty thousand people haven't worked in over five years I mean we need that stopped and   stopped today \n<$A>      were you referring there to  Richard Spring who 's now of course got this job as uh Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State I mean he was saying that uh the the government pressure on departments to cut spending is irresistible, and there 's really nothing that can be done about it And Northern Ireland 's budget 'll be cut just like anywhere else\n<$C> Northern Ireland is not the rest of the United Kingdom It 's not  the rest of Europe Northern Ireland has a, peculiar historical inheritance, and nobody can stand back and wash their hands like Pontius Pilate from it I mean I firmly believe that what we should be saying as Mr Major said that a settlement eventually 'll be put to a referendum If that is the case, then I think the projected levels of public expenditure should be an item in that referendum And the   people of  Northern Ireland should know that\n<$A>  Okay  \n<$A> Graham Gudgin  we saw you in the film Uh not really a very happy uh view of the future economically And uh what struck me was that the downside items that you talked about like security budget being slashed it clearly will be if the peace sticks and yet, the good points such as tourism, or investment from multinationals a bit speculative really\n<$D>  Well of course any growth in the future and uh any future investment is speculative but it 's very likely to come What 's speculative is really the the the amount and the size of new investment I think it 's a great pity in many ways that uh the newspapers and and press coverage in Northern Ireland has concentrated on handouts and extra money particularly from America and Europe, uh and  these will be small The real story here is the opportunity that Northern Ireland now has to grow fast uh particularly in tourism but in in manufacturing in inward investment All these things will give us jobs but they 'll depend on on how well   we grasp the opportunity  \n<$A>  Yes, How   do we harness this opportunity without being  primed or whatever the expression is by government money And yet what you 're saying is what they say they 'll take away and they won't put back in again\n<$D>  Well it 's up to us I mean there there there is money there There 's plenty of money from from the government as there always has been in Northern Ireland and there will be for the next few years in the short term at least It 's then up to people in Northern Ireland to all of us, to grasp this opportunity For instance if if Ronnie Scott 's forecast on tourism on extra tourist visitors to Northern Ireland are correct we 're going to need forty  extra additional large hotels uh over the next five to ten years We 'll need lots of extra  guest houses We 'll need bed and breakfasts We 'll need extra amenities for tourism These are all opportunities for people ordinary people in Northern Ireland to make money, uh to invest their own money in these sorts of  in these sorts of facilities uh and to make \n<$A> You 're getting almost cheerful here now\n<$D>  Well,  well it 's it 's not really a matter I think of optimism or pessimism It 's it 's a matter of realism I mean  one has to inject some realism into this debate because because there 's  obviously   and understandably a good deal of hype  \n<$A>  Right, that 's   a nice point to take in Eamon Hanna realism Now you 've just come back from United States of America Uhm and uh you 've been closely involved with the work of the IDB in the past   as well  Uhm, what was the problem over there about getting Americans to invest here\n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B> Well we were put into the into the lion 's den Uh Joe Hendron and Reg Empey and Alistair McDonald and Des McVeigh uh we were put in with with some of the toughest Wall Street bankers we ever had Tony O'Reilly put us into the bear-pit there It became clear to us that  that our our array of industrial incentives the grant-based packages, is it 's become somewhat outmoded and we have pressed particularly for a change towards a ten percent corporation tax The corporate tax take in Northern Ireland is about three hundred million a year which isn't too far off the security cost I would like to see some of the peace dividend being applied to that because it is clear to us that we are not competitive say with with the Republic of Ireland in terms of attracting inward investment\n<$A>  what where have they been scoring where we haven't been then\n<$B> Because they have been able to intract  projects which are intrinsically more profitable and therefore the companies are able to keep a larger slice of their profits Also here I think we have a very underdeveloped banking, and and venture capital and development capital industry And I think banks have been very very risk averse Uh I had gentleman over last week who was one of the boss in venture capital, uhm companies and people told him that there were no projects in Northern Ireland He said to me my God There are dozens of projects in Northern Ireland And he actually went round those projects and found that these projects are not investable in because the financial structures uh and financing here are not here You get pound for pound on grant packages but very often what a company that has got internationally tradable goods and services needs is more risk capital long-term capital\n<$A> Martin Donegan the point that is often made 's we have uh a skilled workforce here we have uh a high level of uh  education uhm a a lot of plus points, surely when the Troubles uh uh are history we are going to be, on an on a new dawn aren't we There there will be even if it 's just the sense of change which is so important that uh other areas of the world where they 've had decay for for many years maybe people 've, have almost given up This has given a new sense of hope hasn't it\n<$C> Certainly I think, we all feel that we can do it We all feel that possibly the only hindrance has been the Troubles That 's not quite true but when I look at a lot of manufacturing industry which I visit then daily and say we 've survived that We can survive anything We can go forward One of the things that I do hope, we need to do is involve all the community in this restructuring This restructuring is not about just the business community holding conferences It 's not about the IFI We must find a mechanism for involving business agriculture the trade unions the community groups to come up with the ideas to discuss what Eamon said and if necessary to ask for really radical fiscal policies like abolish the corporation taxes\n<$A> But to tritely trot off this phrase peace dividend uh talk to a policeman maybe facing redundancy  or what have you I mean uh it 's a complex situation we 're facing\n<$D>  Yes it is And it 'll be patchy across Northern Ireland And some towns some localities in Northern Ireland aren't going to do very well out of this but uh others others will do well But the province as a whole as I was saying earlier have have opportunities But I 'd like to return to the point Martin Donegan was making earlier uh about long-term unemployment That whatever happens to the economy we are going to have these fifty thousand people who are going to have grave difficulty getting in to taking advantage of these opportunities And that 's a single area where I think government ought to do something and where if we are going to get money from outside from say Brussels uh I 'd like to see it concentrated on on those people   <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  \n<$A>  That 's peanuts   compared as as we pointed out so clearly there to the three thousand million we 're getting every year now from Britain", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Paisley's comments>\n\n\n<$A> Well would you not describe Ian Paisley 's attitude given his weekend speech as intransigent   as well Uh I mean he  I we have already mentioned that fact that that he was hitting out at members of the Ulster Unionist Party he talked about socialising with the enemy His attitude to people from the Irish government was here, I am facing the enemy Was that your attitude\n<$B> Well of course uh they 've made themselves the enemy because of their uhm constitution and so on And uh they they have turned themselves into the enemy What we 're interested in is reaching a situation, where they are no longer the enemy but they are uh  our our neighbours And that 's what we were attempting to raise But  my point about the weekend speech at the DUP conference is confined, to the point that he made that Sir Sir Patrick Mayhew was a wicked and vile Secretary of State And one has to ask oneself, uh is that, accurate Is it true Is he vile and is he wicked because if he 's not then why was the statement made If he is let us have the evidence And uh,   I just don't think you can go round saying that sort of thing about the person who you were going to, ask to argue your case for seven and a half billion pounds a year in the cabinet, the person who you have to persuade and influence if you want to change government policy And if you go about describing him as,  wicked and vile I don't think you 're going to get anywhere\n<$A> Have you have you any reservations about his reported description of Irish Justice Minister Padraig Flynn as Porridge Skin Flynn and uh Foreign Affairs Minister David Andrews as Andrew Liver Republican Salts\n<$B> Well it 's like, we 're not interested in some kind of comicuts I mean we 're dealing with serious political issues, and personalising thing, uh to that extent is not going to to do us any good Our  view on on the Irish ministers and how they performed is is well-known And I 've already indicated that they, uh they they exposed themselves as not being able to deliver uh on the promises that they had made And uh that 's where I would  to leave it Let 's stick to this subject Let 's stick to the issues, and not get involved or side-tracked in in in personality  politics It really isn't going to do anybody least of all the Province any good\n<$A> Well that was Reng  Empey of the Ulster Unionist Party And with me in the studio is the Alliance leader Doctor John Alderdice Well uh you 've branded these weekend comments as uh foolish unhelpful and unpersuasive I 'm sure, you 'd like to amplify that now\n<$C> Well I think they 're rather silly comments apart from the rather childish personalised nature of some of them They 're rather foolish because, if you shout abuse at people you 're more likely to get their backs up than to get their co-operation And what we want to see, is the co-operation of politicians from the Republic of Ireland to change Articles two and three to change lots of other things as well We want to see human rights respected throughout the island and throughout the islands indeed They 're unhelpful comments because a lot of very good quiet productive work has been done over the last few years to change the views of people uh throughout the island uh Some of us have gone to the Republic on on many many occasions to try to begin to bring a more reasonable view of things and that 's begun to be effective Recent elections of, of of Mary Robinson of course in the past week have demonstrated that uh the people of the Republic are beginning, to have a much more flexible  and realistic and friendly view towards people in Northern Ireland\n<$A> But Ian Paisley is proud of the fact that he has said so that they didn't run to Dublin And that 's what he 's saying\n<$C> Yes well of course uh  he he did promise that he was going to go to Dublin He gave  gave undertakings that he was going to do to go to Dublin And he 's not going to persuade anybody in Dublin unless he sits down and talks with them That 's the fact of the matter Sure there 's   no point \n<$A>  Well he is prepared   to do that if they make some movement\n<$C> Oh yes it 's always somebody else that has to make the movement The reality of course is that a number of of leading Southern politicians now after discussions with some of us, uh have been prepared to address the question of articles two and three and the other issues which have got to be addressed as well Uh but that 's not going to be helped by shouting abuse across the border That 's only going to make the hardliners dig in their heels And after the sort of election result we 've had over the last week I think that responsible politicians ought to be welcoming what 's happening in the Republic of Ireland, welcoming the changes that 've taken place and beginning to put forward a view of Northern Ireland as a place populated by reasonable and decent people What do you think people in the Republic of Ireland are going to think when they read those sorts of comments from Ian Paisley at the weekend They 'll say they 're a crowd of rascals up there   and  and of course  we don't want to have anything to do with them\n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> Well  is that not unfair in itself because Ian Ian Paisley  and his party, they represent a a substantial slice of the Northern Ireland population and Northern Ireland uh opinion And if I may paraphrase and show what a lot of his supporters and people are saying Ian Paisley is the only man who will keep us out of the clutches of a united Ireland Now you know that 's   right  You know that 's that 's the gut feeling\n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$C> Oh I know I know there are people who will say that But I 'll tell you this, I know an awful lot of people who will say, people from the Unionist community who will say Ian Paisley has wrecked Northern Ireland Ian Paisley 's the man who 's destroyed everything And instead of keeping us in the United Kingdom he 's turned people in Westminster, off Northern Ireland They want to be rid of us as soon as possible when they see people like Ian Paisley saying I 'm British and I stand for everything British The truth of it is, that there 's no greater friend to those who want to take Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom than somebody who makes Northern Ireland people persona not grata in the United Kingdom And this kind of statement does precisely that It doesn't help Doesn't win us any friends\n<$A> Yes but against that uh uh  there is the the the other view that people know where they stand with Ian Paisley   Well   yes well I mean   a lot of people as  we know we know one thing that Ian Paisley 's not going to run us into a united Ireland let 's put it that way They 're not sure about you and the Alliance Party And they 're a bit worried about some of the uh uh Ulster Unionists uh who have been parleying with Dublin And that 's come through in Ian Paisley 's speech Now,  those are the facts of life They may be unpalatable to you They may be unpalatable to the Ulster Unionists and us But those are the facts of life\n<$C>  Well do they  \n<$C>  Do they I mean  \n<$C> No I 'm afraid I disagree with you I think there 's about three hundred and fifty thousand people who stood outside the city hall, and heard Ian Paisley saying that he was never going to speak to British ministers until the Anglo-Irish Agreement was scrapped, and that he was going to destroy it and bring it down to nothing And where are we seven years later Anglo-Irish agreement 's as strong as ever Unless we get some kind of negotiated agreement, it 's going to be built upon If there was a Labour administration came in in two or three years time it 'll be it would be strengthened even further And Ian Paisley said he 'll never do this and he 'll never do that and he 'll never do the other thing and he 's ended up doing them When people like myself came out and said the Anglo-Irish Agreement was not a fair thing the way it came about and and it wasn't a good agreement but it is not going to be even suspended, uh and we 're going to find we have to go into talks and we have to go negotiate this thing out and we 've stuck with that position over the years and we 've said there have to be compromises and there has to be sharing of responsibility, in Northern Ireland and there has to be good relations with the Republic of Ireland And we 've said it for twenty years and we 're still saying it and   it 's the truth \n<$A>  Yes, now   what whatever your views or members of the public or other politicians ' views  of the Reverend Ian Paisley and very specifically about the strident speech he made at the weekend and the comments he made, I mean he 's been around a long time He 's no mug   Well that  he knows what he 's doing doesn't he I mean he within his own, uh bailiwick he knows what he 's about doesn't he\n<$C>  I think  \n<$C> Well, that remains to be seen There 's some people who 'd say he 's been around too long,   and that he \n<$A>  Well you could   say that of   several politicians  \n<$C>  And that and that   he 's too rooted in the past, and that what 's very important is that we look to the future You  you see you could say about a whole lot of Fianna Fa/il politicians in the Republic of Ireland, they know their people, they know what their people want they want hard green Nationalism and that 's what they 're going to be giving to them But you see a lot of the people in the Republic of Ireland have thankfully begun to say no We want a more progressive approach We want a more pluralist, a more tolerant uh republic, which for example uh accepts that Protestants uh have rights uh and that Protestants should play a full part in the Republic of Ireland And of course if that develops as I hope very much that it does and I think it is  developing, I don't think the Mary Robinson election was a flash in the pan I think this election has shown that there 's real progress We want to see the same thing happening in Northern Ireland We want to see progressive politics here We want to see pluralism and tolerance throughout the whole island, throughout these islands And so while you say, that Ian Paisley stands for the views of some people and he does, whether or not it 's a  it 's a growing group of people, that are looking to the future, or a shrinking group of people that are looking to the past, well of course that 's going to be a matter for for the listeners to Talk Back and all the other people who vote in elections in Northern Ireland to decide over the next number of years\n<$A> Yes let 's look  briefly uh the situation down at at in the South at the moment is is rather fluid  to put it mildly it looks as though, will there be a coalition of some sort Uh we  do you feel I think you do from what you 've been saying that might augur well for the future of talks, but but if Ian Paisley for example sticks to his guns and says look unless you give me that guarantee I 'm not doing anything,  would you have to consider yourself and the other parties going ahead without Ian Paisley",

{"text": "<Coleraine>\n\n\n<$A> And to establish the debate, I 'd just like to ask a number of you what you feel you are what you think  you are or what you are convinced you are And Willie Ross here member local member of  Willie Ross if I asked you, in terms of nationality what are you\n<$B> I 'm British, and an Ulsterman\n<$A> Irish\n<$B> Very long way down the list\n<$A> So if somebody uh over in London, in Westminster some of your friends said oh I want to introduce you to one of the Irish MPs what would you say\n<$B> I would say to him you 're   introduced to one of the Ulster MPs\n<$A> Right now do you feel offended if somebody describes you as Irish\n<$B> No because I was born in the island of Ireland\n<$A> So it 's possible then for you to be Irish and still as you are a British subject No difficulty with that at all\n<$B> No in same way as a Scotsman or a Welshman can be both Scottish or Welsh and a British subject\n<$A> Gentleman beside you sir if you 're asked,\n<$C> Then I 'm was terrified I might be  Uh it 's not I 'd play safe Uh I would call myself Northern Irish\n<$A> Why why do you call yourself Northern Irish\n<$C> I live in Northern Ireland\n<$A> Yes but I mean you live in the island of Ireland\n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> Is that a political statement   do you think you 're making  So what is   it \n<$C>  No it 's not  \n<$C>  No   not at all Uhm, well if I said I was British that 'd be a political statement, in the present context If I said I was Irish, that might be regarded by some as a political statement So uh I, reach for a cowardly compromise and say that I 'm  I 'm Northern Irish\n<$A> Anyone else now on the couch Sean Farren Yes Sean how would you describe yourself\n<$D> I have no difficulty in describing myself as Irish But I think that my identity is uh, more than that because I belong to Europe and uh I feel very much uh a member of the European community And my European identity has been reinforced, uhm very considerably over the last twenty-five years I think it 's very interesting that what we 're discussing today uhm this evening uhm was also on the agenda for the talks up at Stormont today And as a member of the SDLP delegation,   I was \n<$A>  I didn't   know that \n<$D> No well I was, I was involved in a very interesting exchange with members of uh Mr Ross ' party on this particular issue Uh the question of identity its political dimensions and in particular, the problem of our political allegiance that flows from our identity And I think that goes to the nub of the problem in terms of our general political situation\n<$A> Yes but  you do realise the difficulty some people have of accepting the proposition that they are Irish people   within the Unionist community \n<$D>  Of course  , of course I think uh what we did agree uh today on was that need to respect and to entrench respect for our different identities and to allow people, to express themselves and to hold their identities as they define them and not to pretend that people should be what we would like them to be\n<$A> Alright uhm I see Nelson McCausland over here Nelson, what are you\n<$E> I 'm an Ulsterman Uh I 'm British But the question of identity I think is much more complex than that because we have all many different identities I have a religious identity as a Protestant I have a cultural identity as an Ulster Scot I have a national identity then as a British Ulsterman\n<$A> But does your religious uh identity impact on your politics\n<$E> Well I would have to say that personally as a Christian  my faith does influence my politics\n<$A> So is  are we saying and this is an interesting point then  are we saying are we concluding then that and all the opinion polls recently say that Protestants most Protestants will describe themselves as British and most Catholics as Irish John Barr you would have read all these opinion polls\n<$F>  Yeah of course I have I mean if uh  the difference is that uh some people hold political and religious views through shared conviction, something they worked out for themselves It 's a rational conclusion Others do not And the only hope for this country is we start to think for ourselves and come to politics and religion with conviction   rather than  some other way \n<$A>    \n<$A> Is it possible then to have what might be described as a shared identity sir\n<$G> Yeah I think uh for example the the Green Party put forward a a post-nationalist uh identity It 's, essential that we begin to adopt a much more complex multiple and plural sense of identity and not ask only about the content but what we mean by identity and why certain elements of identity are politically salient\n<$A> Yeah now it 's okay You 're all being very good and you 're all being very diplomatic but that 's not the way it is in some places Now for example today, I spoke to a lady, on the radio, and it was about what happened last night or last evening at Connswater with the Prime Minister And the Prime Minister was described as scum He was described as a traitor He was told to go back to England And one listener said, to another lady who was on, well do you agree with that And she more or less said yes He said what would happen if you went to ten Downing Street And I put the point if you went to ten Downing Street and a lot of English people said to you go home you Irish scum, what would you say And she said I 'm British So could you imagine someone then going to a crowd across the water and saying, no would you mind rephrasing that It 's British scum go home Gentleman here I recognise how do you feel about this question of identity You 're from\n<$H> Dunloy originally\n<$A>  that 's right Yes I recognise you yes\n<$H> Can I say that uh I hear Sean Farren 's remarks about respect, for each other 's identity and each other 's culture and religion In Dunloy we stand as a minority group and then as an Orangeman an Ulster Protestant and a Presbyterian Evangelical, Our religion has been denied us Our civil   and religious liberty \n<$A>  In what way   has your religion been denied you\n<$H> Can I say very briefly first of all now on three occasions we have attempted to get to the Presbyterian church where we have gone for a hundred years and hold a service of divine worship once a year That has been denied us There 's those that come out onto the street and block the road Those who attack us My father 's been savagely beaten by people from Dunloy And yet each time, each time it is the law-abiding citizens who have given lawful notice that is turned away Surely the case must be that we must respect each others ' identity each others ' religion We must have the right to worship in freedom of our own conscious  and dictates   and  the Orangemen of Dunloy have been denied that\n<$A>  But  \n<$A> Well Delia Close uh is behind you and uh Harryville, have you been denied the rights that this gentleman 's talking about\n<$I> Uhm, in some way yes but uh we do still go to church People are still there but uhm, we uh are not denied access to the church We go in We have our service We come out   again \n<$A>  But you   face a barrage of of of criticism and you face uh a barrage of catcalling Isn't that right   when you 're going \n<$I>  Not   currently\n<$A> Not currently no   but I 'm talking about  over that period\n<$I>  It 's not actually  \n<$I> Yes a year or so ago   that  would 've been the case   Currently  they 're still there but they 're a lot quieter\n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> Right you were going to say something to me Yes\n<$J> Yes uh David McConaghy from the Independent Orange Order As an Independent Orangeman I come at the whole subject slightly different, than a member of the main Orange Order would Uh I would concur with what Nelson McCausland has already said As an Independent Orangeman, I am first and foremost an Evangelical Protestant I 'm here tonight as an Evangelical Protestant as a minister of the gospel My membership of our institution, and its activities is an expression of my faith Now  what that means for me as an Independent Orangeman is if we take a church parade, from the moment that we assemble, during our parade down the road, going into the church the service the closing prayer, the journey home and the dispersal, that for me, is an expression of my Evangelical Protestant faith Now   I \n<$A>  But   is it not also a commemoration of battles past and has a military element to it\n<$J> As an Independent Orangeman, my membership and its activities is first and foremost an expression of our faith Now I accept the fact that there are many people, would find that strange with disagree with that I find many elements of Roman Catholicism strange and disagreeable, but I extend to them, the right to their worship the right to their faith\n<$A> Alright Pat McHugh in front of you\n<$K> Well I would describe myself as a a wobbly to start with Uhm, but  it does seem to me that the crucial issue is why do we have to wait for programmes like  Let 's Talk to talk Uh I mean I go to church in Harryville uh and I find that people who are throwing abuse at me uh who 've thrown stones at old people I don't believe are Evangelical Protestants I I don't think they belong to to any church But I think the whole core is that if we 've got to get on together in this community, at this time, irrespective what people believe about other people the only way through the process is talking I 've just finished reading Mandela 's story The Long Walk to Freedom It 's amazing what went on in South Africa in terms of talking with people you thought wouldn't 've talked And they 've come up with a solution to their difficulties So Jack McCann used to say talking and jaw is  jaw jaw is better than war war So irrespective who 's who and what 's what get into the talks\n<$A> Yeah what about the uhm is there somebody else over here Yes is there somebody over there wish to uh you see the the religious dimension in this uh the difficulty is that I think we sketch around it from time to time But I sense when I talk to some members of the Evangelical Protestant community uh some members of the Orange Order perhaps that the great fear the great fear within the island of Ireland is, it 's not so much a political fear it 's a religious fear There 's their fear of Rome There 's a fear of the imperial outreach of Rome that somehow and it has been stated by some councillors that the Roman Catholic church will prevent Protestants from actually going to their place of worship The Protestants will simply dwindle away Any thoughts on that sir, It you yes\n<$L> Certainly uhm well I I I think the the most important thing is we 've we 've heard it  said already tonight this idea that people 've been denied their rights   this was never true uh with regard to Protestants going to to service They have never been stopped having service What they 've been stopped doing is marching through another area in the process to that And lot of that comes down to the respect people choose to have for beliefs held by other people I don't care whether you

{"text": "<Belfast life>\n\n\n<$A> From the earliest days people had very mixed ideas about cities There are strong hints that the earliest bible writers, neither liked nor trusted city life At the same time nobody can deny that cities pull together great forces for human advancement, culture and learning law and administration But maybe the Old Testament Bible writers had an instinct that was right, for cities have much that is sad and sordid Today these tensions are clearly evident in Belfast Many marvellous things are happening In spite of the hammering it has taken, Belfast buzzes But there 's also squalor and crime and violence and loneliness So for many people, the big B stings To help us understand these two faces of the city, I 'm joined today by Father Matt Wallace from St Peter 's Cathedral on the Falls Road, Paul Daragh medical doctor, and Secretary of Townsend Street Presbyterian Church on the Lower Shankill, Brendan Murtagh formerly with the Housing Executive, and Stanley McDowell former Town Clerk of Belfast Stanley McDowell you would know as much about the city and its administration as anybody else here Can you tell us what are the key factors that really make up a city 's complex life\n<$B> Thank-you David I think before moving to answer that question I would like to pick up the point you made about the Biblical analysis I 'm conscious that the gospel starts in a garden, but ends in a city And if you go through to Revelation you 'll find that the culmination of the Biblical record, is in a city Now, what lessons we draw from that I 'm not quite sure but I think it has a relevance to our discussion It 's a city of course where the standards are very different from those of Belfast I think also I would like to say that there are problems in other communities not least in rural communities And you mentioned squalor crime violence and loneliness and I 'm sure that those pertain in the rural areas But let 's turn to Belfast, always with the caveat that we mustn't think ourselves peculiar or unique In the City Council is a very necessary part of the government of the city at a variety of levels It has an executive role where it provides services for the citizens to allow them to fulfil their interests and follow their pursuits, and enrich their lives It has an enforcement role which ensures that a minimum standard of public hygiene, is maintained And you only have to look at uh cities where the infrastructure has failed as in the former Yugoslavia, to realise the importance of that The council also has a representational role, in making government aware of the needs of the citizens needs in relations to the services which the council itself does not provide It has a, consultative and ceremonial role So it undertakes uh a variety of roles, seeking to provide to the citizens, the standards and the environment, which will allow them to do their thing\n<$A> So it looks after more than graveyards and garbage by a long bit\n<$B> Oh very much so Uh I think uh it 's unfortunate that perhaps, uhm, those are focused on when there is much which it does to ensure the quality of life so that we can go about, uh confident that public health will as a very minimum   <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  One of   the things that we 'll be exploring in this particular programme is to see just how well they succeed in Belfast Paul Daragh your work 's in the city You 're very much a city man Is your heart in the city\n<$C> Absolutely Uh I was born in the city I had my formative years have been spent in the city, and I 've worked in the city Uh and though I choose to live outside the city, I spend most of my leisure time actually back working in the city I think this is a wonderfully optimistic time uh for work in the cities And uh some allusion there was to the problems of the city, but let 's remember that ninety percent of the population of Western Europe is going to be living in cities, by the turn of this century It is most important that we enjoy and celebrate, the virtues of the city, the genius, the industry, the vibrancy the excitement There is so much going on in a city Yes there are bad things, but there are also good things And we should also see the city, in relation to all other cities in this world, because many many cities have far worse problems than ours, and survive and continue to to change and improve\n<$A> Brendan Murtagh uh an optimistic a buoyant mood of the city there Now your particular interest is housing And I would think that ninety percent of the people of Europe can't live in cities unless there 's adequate housing for them And is there a great need for new and better housing in in in Belfast and if it is  supplied can ordinary people, then find an attractive lifestyle within the city\n<$D> Yes I think they can Uhm the, housing problems of Belfast go go back a long way The industrial revolution led to, the development of a lot of cramped poor  poor quality squalid housing Now when the uhm major redevelopment programmes and road programmes cleared those houses, in the late seventies and early nineteen-eighties, it replaced them with often unsuitable and substandard housing themselves Now city planners have learnt from those mistakes in Belfast, and have started to develop a range and quality of housing provision, that is very much suited to the individual needs and aspirations and lifestyles of the citizens of Belfast The unfitness rate in the city has, uh declined remarkably since the early nineteen-seventies when it was one of the worst in Britain Now Belfast hosts a wide range of uhm visits from other cities uh throughout Europe, to look at the quality of housing and to see the quality   of life there \n<$A>  Well are are   we really getting on top of it then\n<$D> I think in terms of uh in I think in terms in the quality and range of housing that we are beginning to see uhm the provision of of housing which is very much suited to the quality of life of people who live in Belfast in particular And I think that 's important\n<$A> Matt Wallace uh you 're a priest involved in community work and inevitably your work is amongst the less advantaged people of the city with far fewer choices and ability to make choices Can they enjoy the city as it is at the moment\n<$E> Yes I think so David More and more so they 're adopting a positive attitude, uh towards their environment towards their housing Uh that 's coupled in it has a lot to do I think with the fact that  this year we 're celebrating the final demise of demise of Divis Flats Divis is no more And it has been replaced by quality real good quality   housing which the people uhm are looking after extremely well It 's great to see them supporting each other so much moving into their new homes and being looking out for each other be supportive of each other And that coupled with the economic developments that we 've made in those areas through job clubs especially, uh the people the young men and women especially  are now getting, they have an achievement mentality I think which is helping them enormously For a long time we suffered from uhm, labour immobility in that area because of the sectarian security situation But now people are moving out now readily moving out of the city centre readily taking up jobs in the city centre wherever they can get them And uhm there 's probably not a store uh a shop in Belfast where you won't find someone from west Belfast in one way or another working And that 's a big step forward and as a result, the knock-on  effect of that is they will go go out at night then into the city centre to uh for enjoyment the pictures whatever it may be theatre whatever it is Even young people are going back more and more city centre\n<$A> So the consensus seems to be around the table that in spite of all its problems there 's no reason why people in Belfast shouldn't enjoy a very good form of life Uh I spoke to Methodist Minister Jim Ray of the East Belfast Mission on the Lower Newtownards Road, and asked him if his part of Belfast was buzzing\n<$F> I think that if you were to look at East Belfast, at this particular season of the year, in the, season of, Orange celebration, you would say it 's certainly it buzzing There 's a lot of activity around There 's a lot of people on the streets There 's a lot of demonstration and celebration But I think if you look at it in another sense, at the problems, that are underlying, in the East Belfast community they are quite immense,\n<$A> So let 's hear about some of the problems that are there the  the long term and and what caused them in your opinion\n<$F> Well I think there 's tremendous unemployment Uh, in the three wards surrounding Ballymacarret, I think I 'm right in saying that about fifty  one percent of the working population are unemployed And that has been largely caused by the demise of the major industries, and I would say in particular, by the demise of the Belfast Shipyard Because the particular area of East Belfast where we work,  was an area where almost all the menfolk living in the area actually worked in the yard And the yard as you know has contracted from a workforce of around twenty-eight thirty thousand to a workforce of around three thousand\n<$A> And that of course has decimated then the the uh the the streets uh  made the kind of community life of those streets much less uh confident\n<$F> Well there is really no confidence about employment I mean one of the great problems is that young people in particular leaving school, have absolutely no hope of finding jobs There are of course government schemes, that will provide young people with extra training and support, but in a sense real jobs don't appear to be there, and there 's a very bleak kind of future And I think that that causes other problems for example, uh the excessive amount of drinking and the development of alcoholism and the uh departure of young people in young men in particular, into the hands of paramilitaries who will use and abuse them,\n<$A> We 're being told by so many people that we 're turning the corner that Belfast 's on the up as a city Are there any upswings at all in your part of the world at East Belfast,\n<$F> I think there are upswings I think the upswings that I see, would be first of all that uh certainly people are enjoying a better life in the terms of housing situation in which they find themselves Uh people, uh are living in very good homes And one has to praise organisations and, uh institutions like the Housing Executive, who I think in recent years, have really done good work in the provision of very good housing for people I think at another level, there is for me, a great feeling that in our community, there are many many people and a growing majority of people, who are tired of violence, who are no longer prepared to be sold a lie that they have got to do certain things in order to defend their community, who are willing to recognise that on both sides of the community there are good and decent people And they are looking to the future And their hope is that these Troubles will end, that the politicians in Northern Ireland will find a fair and just solution that will rebuild Northern Ireland as a place that 's worth to live  worth living in", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL",

{"text": "<Counterpoint Panel>\n\n\n<$A> Well joining us in the Counterpoint studio here in Belfast is the Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford John Taylor, and from Belfast the Progressive Unionist David Ervine In Dublin we have the security correspondent of the Irish Independent newspaper That 's Tom Brady And in London we have the SDLP 's justice spokesman, Seamus Mallon Seamus Mallon how much fear uh do you assess in your community\n<$B> I think there 's great apprehension at the present moment of time We have heard the uh the clips that you have broadcast already I think that tells a little bit of the story because there 's so much that we hasn't been made public yet and uh that must be taken into account as well\n<$A> What do you mean by what hasn't been made public\n<$B> I think the number of people who have had to move house as a result of direct threats on their lives has not got into the public domain yet I know that from uh practical experience I know that uh instances where that has happened And I think when you add up this entire picture, what you see is an absolute threat to the Nationalist community for political reasons And those political reasons you have uh enumerated some of them, are as spurious as they ever were And what the what the Loyalist uh paramilitary groupings are saying is that those who don't agree with their peculiar warped twisted type of political uh agenda are legitimate targets Members of our party uh eighteen of them, have been attacked in the recent months, very murderous attacks indeed Other people have been uh uh victims of this in other ways which I will not specify at this moment of time And that is showing very clearly that it is an attack on the entire Catholic community And I agree totally with Father Dan White, when he says every time it looks as if the Nationalist community might get a little bit of place in the sun within the North of Ireland then this type of attack uh  attacks start from within the Loyalists paramilitary groupings Could I also say this, because we have heard the reasons, it it was supposed to be in reaction to IRA violence I never believed that I don't think anybody else ever did It is very much uh a political type of terrorism   And that, that is increased  And could I make this point because it 's crucially important at this moment That has been increased by the utterances of some Unionist politicians And when you look at the words of John Taylor yesterday in the House of Commons about Irish people who are working in the Channel  Tunnel and Irish firms uh uh who are uh involved there That is sheer incitement to hatred That is racism at its worst   And that is, that is the type, that is the type  of incitement to hatred   which leads these people to pick out  their targets\n<$A>  Let me ask you something  \n<$A>  How do you answer that John Taylor, okay Point made \n<$C>  Well I can answer that very simply  \n<$A> Okay Seamus Mallon Point made   How do you answer it John Taylor \n<$C>  I can answer   I can answer that very simply by saying that the Minister uh agreed with what I said and confirmed that indeed there would be proper vetting of all people involved in the sub-contracts that had been allocated   to Southern Irish firms And it is only right  that there should be vetting and I 'm glad that the government have agreed to do that   Now \n<$B>  I think you should apologise to the Irish people <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>  \n<$A>  Are you uh   prepared to apologise\n<$C> Not in the least   It 's very important  that we do not have any risk to the public who use the Eurotunnel We know that Irish people support the IRA Luckily most Irish people are against the IRA But there are no Greeks no French no Germans in the IRA They 're all Irish, and therefore they are a risk\n<$B>  I think you should  \n<$A>   Well there are Greeks and Germans in other terrorist organisations but Let no I I wanted to address  another point that   Seamus Mallon made  And it it is this that that the Loyalist terrorists are pursuing political aims They 've got a political agenda How long it is going to be before the Unionist politicians set the political agenda and tell the terrorists to leave it alone\n<$B>  They 're pointing their guns guns and their words at specific targets \n<$C>  Could I uh, come come back to this  \n<$C>  Yeah, yeah  \n<$C> Well of course the political agenda has been coloured by Republican terrorism for over twenty years now Uh listening to this programme you would think that it is only Nationalist politicians who are being attacked but we remember that the Republican terrorists killed Edgar Graham Sir Norman Strong James Strong Robert Bradford and almost myself The Protestant community have been living in great fear from Republican terrorism for the last twenty-five years And regrettably now and it 's quite right, the the it 's true uh it 's that the Catholic community are now suffering the same fear And this is the kind of thing we 've got to get out of Ulster politics You know, if you kill one Catholic today and one Protestant tomorrow it doesn't change the political situation in Northern Ireland There will still be over six hundred thousand Catholics left in Northern Ireland and still around one million Protestants   And  those two groups have to learn to live with each other\n<$A>  David Ervine  \n<$A> David Ervine why why do you think Unionists, Loyalists seem to get it so wrong\n<$D> I 'm not sure I understand that we get it wrong I think we 're a deeply misunderstood people Seamus Mallon said something interesting when he said, when there is progress it looks like the Nationalists are going to have a little place in the sun within Northern Ireland That 's a significant statement from Seamus, because hitherto Seamus has been telling the Unionist population for a very long time, one you do not have a legitimate political philosophy, that uh you come from, or this is uh a failed political entity, and that indeed uh challenges to our culture and challenges of to our way of life Seamus Mallon has no difficulty with his Irishness He has a problem with my Britishness\n<$A> Well I 'm not sure that all those quotes are, are attributable to you Seamus Mallon Are they\n<$B>   I was very surprised to hear those  I mean the reality of the situation is that I have been at pains for a number of weeks now if not months, to try and explain to people that the real essence of the the self-determination as defined in the Joint Declaration is that it is based on the consent of a majority of the people in the north of Ireland And I think that 's something which is fundamental to the whole uh to   to the whole approach And that is something which the Unionist people should look at and understand and realise, that that has been given since nine eight nineteen eighty-six, in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in the Joint Declaration and given willingly by the vast majority of the people in Northern Ireland   And the key \n<$D>   They 're certainly attributable to the SDLP  \n<$A>  Do you have a   problem with David Ervine 's Britishness\n<$B> I have no problem with it whatsoever I have lived in the north of Ireland all my life I will continue to live there I have no problem whatsoever with the political views or the cultural views of any of the people that I live among What I have a problem is with   is and I I say it now It is this Where you have the type of division that we have, where you have loyal uh Loyalist paramilitaries doing what they 're doing, and where you have unionist politicians almost apologising for that, uh trying to explain it, giving the most , most spurious of reasons, instead of standing up like men and leading their people, and leading their people on the basis of the the the of approach which was presented to them, for years, by the Nationalist community, by a community which has stood up against the IRA and everyone else who would try to impose their will on people uh by by force of arms That is what the Unionist politicians should be doing Instead of doing that they are skulking around the edges of paramilitarism, they 're making excuses for them and they are not giving leadership And that is why the Unionist community at the present moment of time, I feel uh feel themselves disadvantaged And looking   and listening to Mr Taylor and  others I can understand why they feel disadvantaged\n<$?>  Right <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$A> Okay I 'll I 'll let you both in in just one moment but Tom Brady 's waiting patiently in Dublin Now one of the things Loyalist  paramilitaries or Loyalist terrorists, have done this year Tom is they 've gone across the border with the incendiary bomb What 's the reaction there at the moment What 's the fear about the fact that Loyalists seem to be perfecting the bomb better and better and next time it mightn't be an incendiary, it might be something much more powerful\n<$E> Well there is considerable concern at the sporadic campaign that the Loyalists have been carrying out here mainly through incendiary devices And that concern was heightened last September when the RUC chief constable decided to go public with his warning that the Loyalists were perfecting their bombing capabilities and that there was a uh likelihood of massive bomb attacks in the south But it has been very much a hit-and-miss campaign so far And what there is more concern about among the  security forces is the possibility of uh close-quarter shooting And as a result of that there has been uh increased protection for potential targets such as senior politicians and judges It has also been a step-up in security at Leinster House where the Senate and the Da/il sits\n<$A> So it 's being taken as a genuine threat\n<$E> Yes it is yeah\n<$A> Okay Tom I 'll I 'll hope to get back to you before the end of the programme I apologise if I don't because the two gentlemen here in Belfast have a lot to answer, from Seamus Mallon and and the gist of it seems to be the weakness of the Unionist leadership\n<$C> Oh of course that 's old Seamus all over again Uhm, it it is an unfair criticism of Jim Molyneaux and the and the Ulster Unionist party There uh from his leadership downwards there has been total rejection of violence at all occasions, and no explanation why violence is taking place or no apologies for violence taking place We have always condemned Loyalist violence   from the  leadership downwards\n<$A>  Okay  \n<$A> But there 's a difference between condemning it and trying to stop it And whether you like it or not I think you 've got to admit that the what the SDLP have done through John Hume in their talks with Sinn Fe/in is to try and get the gun out of that side of the equation which would lead to the gun being taken out of politics, full stop\n<$C> Well the SDLP have been at it for twenty-five years They certainly haven't stopped the IRA killing We 've had another example of their failure today, in the slaughter of that young policeman in the in South Belfast\n<$A> But at least they 're trying to persuade Sinn Fe/in to persuade the IRA to stop\n<$C> Well John Hume was but, he said he was in secret talks but of course we 've never  heard what took place in those talks and nor have we seen the actual document which I think Seamus Mallon hasn't seen either So we don't really know what we 're talking about   It 's hearsay \n<$A>  David Ervine  , what about persuading Loyalists, so-called Loyalists, to drop the gun and the bomb\n<$D> It 's a great idea and it 's a great theory I don't think it 's likely to happen until such times as the IRA, lay down their weapons I might say that to Seamus Mallon if I could that the the arrogance of Nationalism, when John Hume and Gerry Adams and John Hume is challenged by Gerry at the polls or, the SDLP are challenged by Sinn Fe/in at the polls, I don't see that the Loyalist paramilitaries, uh or the Loyalist terrorists as you wish to call them uhm are being challenged or are challenging the uh official Unionist Party or the Democratic Unionist Party at the polls Uh Nationalism has given greater credence to the terrorist on the Nationalist side than Loyalism ever has And they are realities", "subdomain":

{"text": "<Attorney General>\n\n\n<$A> It has never happened before and I have article thirty-five four of the Constitution in front of me and it says that a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity and then only on resolutions passed by the Da/il and by the Seanad calling for his removal\n<$B> Okay\n<$A> Now, it not only has it never happened before it 's never even been contemplated but the most important thing I think is that stated misbehaviour refers to stated misbehaviour as a judge\n<$B> And he has done nothing as a judge uh to warrant any such move\n<$A> Absolutely not Uhm I mean I mean I was uh fascinated to hear what uh Geraldine had to say about this possibility but uh all I can say is that I would be flabbergasted if there was an attempt to try to remove or impeach uh Mr Justice Whelehan It 's it 's it 's an amazing uh it may well be discussed in Leinster House I don't deny that but it uh just looking at it from my lawyer 's hat on I mean it is an amazing uhm proposition\n<$B> And what about a government   quietly asking, yes yes Geraldine \n<$C>  Pat Pat, Pat can   mind if I just come in on one point\n<$B> Yeah\n<$C> I said you asked me I mean all of the speculation here is centring on Mr Whelehan being uh removing himself or being removed as President of the High Court and you asked me how could this be done There are two ways One is that he 'd resign the other is that he 'd impeach be impeached Now we don't actually know that that   they are going to \n<$B>  That either will occur  \n<$C> Well uh there 's very strong speculation that the government will be saved, that a deal can be done Labour are aware of this Whatever 's being considered uhm uh uh they seem to be interested in and it seems to centre on Harry Whelehan but we don't know that they 're considering impeachment I mean I must say that in reference to what Gerard has said right There are two ways that Harry Whelehan could now not continue in that job\n<$B> Well is there any way uh Gerard in which Harry Whelehan could resign as President of the High Court and remain a High Court judge and they would uhm appoint somebody else as the President That would be a a compromise\n<$A> Well as I read the Constitution the President of the High Court is a separate office and uh I think Mr Justice Whelehan could of course voluntarily resign but may I say this uh that, uh again I know these are extraordinary times but the very notion of the government asking a judge to resign uh in these circumstances to do and I don't wish to be disrespectful to either party in government because I recognise the difficulties but effectively to do uh politicians of various ilks a favour uh is again something that is, just simply staggers the the lawyer 's imagination Nothing of the kind has ever happened in the history of the State uh\n<$B> Because it would drag uhm a man who was involved in the political arena as uh Attorney General it would drag him back into the political arena and once you 're a judge you 're supposed to be above all that\n<$A> Absolutely, absolutely and that is the whole contemplation of article thirty-five of the Constitution and that 's why judges uh they 're subject to certain things that you and I can't do They can't engage in politics uh they have to keep a certain reserve from the rest of mankind But they 're given in return certain guarantees and one of the guarantees is that of independence\n<$B> Okay uh thanks very much Gerard for that for that contribution Geraldine just going back to you about yesterday afternoon Uhm the Taoiseach at several points uh made reference to the file that was seen by only one individual in the Attorney General 's office\n<$C> He did yes\n<$B> Yeah In other words the the sort of cloak that is normally put over the activities of the civil service uh which didn't happen in the case of Brian Cowan recently where an individual uh came forward But uh are we getting to the days where civil servants are going to have to be accountable for their actions and perhaps even in the Da/il\n<$C> Uhm I doubt it Pat In the formal sense I doubt it I doubt that that the government would bring in legislation or change the whole uhm constitutional balance of government for that to happen I think what we 've seen are a few isolated incidents which are I I think  unfortunate because a minister in any department and Mr Reynolds made this clear is the technical and administrative and political head of that department and he is accountable, he is publicly elected and accountable to the Da/il for the actions of that department So I actually don't think that we will see a change where civil servants can be named and blamed   and I think that it 's a very undesirable \n<$B>  Because it seems to me that   Mr Reynolds you know but Mr Reynolds uhm vindicated the Attorney General the former Attorney General Mr Whelehan now the the President of the High Court vindicated him   totally  yesterday  , and  and yet he said that there was blame to be attached but he didn't attach the blame except by mentioning that one individual had the file all the time\n<$C>  Mm  \n<$C>  Mhm  \n<$C> Yes and that was one of the reasons why the statement as it stood yesterday was that that was the primary reason that it was unacceptable to the Labour Party   In  in other words having uh having spelt out how this particular Father Smyth case had been handled in the Attorney General 's office, having found flaws that Mr in the handle of it which Mr Reynolds found unacceptable   He  then went on to state in an important line on page eighteen of his statement uh that that nothing emerged that made Mr Whelehan unsuitable for appointment as President of the High Court\n<$B>  Yeah he  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> So uhm if if a head had rolled in the AG 's office do you think that the Labour Party would have been I mean   either the AG 's head \n<$C>  I don't I got no sense   of that over the last number of days because that in a sense would address the handling of of the Father Smyth case and not the goings-on at last Friday 's Cabinet meeting, the breach of trust and the fact that Fianna Fa/il uh breached the whole spirit of constitutional government by making a decision uh uh without their coalition partners being present\n<$B> Okay well Geraldine all we can do is wait   and  see what uh emerges and   thanks  very much Frank for joining us on the line\n<$C>  Okay Pat  \n<$C>  Thank-you  \n<$D> I 'd just like, Hello Pat\n<$B> Yes\n<$D> Can I just make one comment there on what Geraldine was saying\n<$B> Yes\n<$D> You see the problem is that is the system that we operate within I spent five years in the Department of Education and we are still operating a Victorian system of of administration in this country where a file when it came up to me as the Minister for State had to be signed and countersigned by five civil servants on the way up and it is impossible for the Minister to see everything that goes through his department and really this case points to the fact that we must change a very inefficient system of government and it doesn't surprise me in the least that Harry Whelehan uh didn't see this file He should have seen it But the fact of the matter is it 's the system in which we operate which is totally archaic and it   needs to be fundamentally changed \n<$B>  But still  , given what was stitched into the record by uh was it John Murray about uh the AG and extradition uh it is important that the the former Attorney General Mr Whelehan would have realised that the one thing he had to see were extradition warrants That was the one thing he had to see\n<$D> Correct There there was a very major mistake made and as the Taoiseach said there has to be a fundamental change in that office and indeed in in the whole system that operates   within the civil service where you have you have very good  where you 've very good and talented civil service who are completely stifled by the system in which they operate\n<$B>  We we haven't got to the bottom  \n<$B> You see what people want to know is did he see every other warrant that arrived around the same time you know or that arrived after Did he see all those warrants and was this the only one he missed or what I mean we haven't really got answers to those questions and until we do this uh this uh this mystery will never be quite uh resolved in the public mind Anyway look Frank uh it 's going to be a long day I suspect so thank-you very much for joining us uh from Leinster House\n<$D> Thank-you\n<$B> All the best And Geraldine Kennedy also talking to us from there and thanks to Gerard Hogan of the Law School in Trinity

{"text": "<Questions Answers 1>\n\n\n<$A> I don't John because I 'm getting a bit tired of the whole thing at this stage frankly and I think every succeeding clarification uh simply raises further questions which require further clarification and we can if it is going on endlessly so I prefer to leave the firm reconstruction of what happened over those days to a proper inquiry as distinct from bits and pieces coming from various angles I don't doubt by the way the the the truth of what individuals are saying in terms of their own recollection It 's very hard to remember what you said an hour ago very often much less what exactly passed nearly a month ago now and I would prefer to leave all that to whatever committee of inquiry is now going to investigate everything What I what does puzzle me a little bit uhm if Dick Spring was in fact fully aware of all these issues on the sixteenth is why he should actually have pulled out after Geraldine Kennedy 's uhm story broke uh and why as accomplished a politician as he is couldn't have found a way of staying in if he really wanted to Because when he pulled out he greatly weakened his own bargaining position in terms of a subsequent coalition His whole strength depends on being able to play Fine Gael off against Fianna Fa/il and once he pulled out from Fianna Fa/il he was then in a much weaker bargaining position and I can't really see why as experienced a politician as as he is would have done that unless he was very confident indeed of his position of three weeks before\n<$B> But the publication surely of Geraldine Kennedy 's story made it impossible for uh for Labour to continue with the arrangements with Fine   Gael \n<$A>  Oh I I   don't think that anything is impossible for a professional politician if he really puts his mind to it He can find a rationalisation for almost any posture he wishes to adopt   And Dick  Spring is a very professional politician It 's the highest compliment I can pay him\n<$B>  Isn't this a  \n<$B> That was my question You anticipated it It 's a compliment Avril Doyle you mightn't necessarily consider that a compliment I suppose would you\n<$C> I don't and I would have hoped that Professor Joe Lee would be amongst those who believe that the day of the cute hoor in politics is over   I hope to God it 's over \n<$A>  Oh what is all that  \n<$B> That 's only a minor   element of it \n<$C>  They can justify   anything when the occasion demands to me this maxim the cute hoor but let 's leave that there 's a more important issue at stake now Uh quite frankly, the Fianna Fa/il Labour uh coalition has broken down irretrievably because of the failure to uh expose the existence of the Duggan case We need a new government in place urgently a stable government as quickly as possible And today 's revelations about who said what to whom on the sixteenth of uh November in the Taoiseach 's office in the presence of Dick Spring et-al really is only adding further layers of confusion and actually distracting from the main focus of what the politicians certainly those who are negotiating to set up a government should be about I now would agree that all of today 's confusion added to the layers of confusion we 've had for the last five weeks should immediately go to an inquiry, probably the Committee on Security and Legislation if we ever manage to sort out the whole area of privilege and compellability of witnesses and I have some slight doubts as to what end of that when this piece of legislation is through perhaps this week But let 's assume we can sort out the whole area of of of of privilege for witnesses other than just Da/il witnesses, uh I think a body such as that should immediately take the layers of confusion sort out and reveal exactly what has gone on And and could I suggest John that let 's not forget with five weeks ' confusion heaped upon confusion that we still have to be told why it took seven months uh in the Attorney General 's office to sit on the Father Brendan Smyth extradition We still don't know the very first question the answer to the very first question and we still don't know why Albert Reynolds was prepared in political terms to risk all to bring down his government to appoint Harry Whelehan as president of the High Court We 've not had an explanation we all have our views and our versions but those two essential questions that precipitated this this political crisis have yet to be answered\n<$B> And Gerry Collins are you if you 'd been in the Cabinet now do you think this would have happened or do you think your wisdom brought to the occasion would have saved Fianna Fa/il\n<$D> Uhm I I suppose I could easily say it wouldn't have happened if I were there I don't know I would hope not, but what I do want to say now is that for the people who 're watching this programme, the people in the audience, what 's important now is to have a government My party is not in the position to form a government that 's quite clear Uh we have nobody who would want to share government with us so therefore we 're out and what I would want to say very clearly very simply, bearing in mind that we 've three hundred thousand people out of work, bearing in mind that there are many people depending on stable government for many different reasons, I want to see a government there and see a government there quickly Now having got a government established I also want to see the full story come out   and \n<$B>  You 're   with Ray Burke on this are you\n<$D> I 'm I 'm with everybody who wants to know the full story and of course I saw and heard what Ray Burke said and I support him   as <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  He said   he was sad angry and upset and whoever has been responsible let them pay the price\n<$D> I want to see the full story out in the open uh I want to make sure that people will have again respect for the democratic institution of of parliament That I want to see perhaps more than any uh and I think that 's exceptionally important I want to see the cynics who can easily point the finger all politicians are all the same I resent that I 'm not one of those, I wouldn't want to be one of those and I 'm sure the same equally applies to my colleagues here who are members of the Oireachtas I I want\n<$B> Do you think Fianna Fa/il is hurting at the moment\n<$D> Of course it is Naturally it it 's naturally it 's of course it is hurting Why shouldn't it be hurting because we 're uh\n<$B> Especially Fianna Fa/il you think\n<$D> Especially Fianna Fa/il right now and the country 's hurting as well And people within Fianna Fa/il are sad uh they 're angry Yes I am sad I am angry I 'm concerned Of course I am but I 'm equally determined to ensure that whatever length of time we 're in opposition that we 'll rebuild our party and we 'll be there again for another day\n<$C> Could I ask Gerry whether he he agrees that Albert has actually burst the party now\n<$D> I I I I think that question is you know pretty, a left-handed one Avril uh and\n<$B> I 'm I 'm quoting your   own words to you I 'm quoting your own words to you \n<$D>  I I accept that I I 'm quite aware   I 'm quite well aware of a statement I made three years or so ago uh about certain difficulties I foresaw for the Fianna Fa/il parliamentary party Having said what I said then I have not since then repeated that Uh I regret the way now the position that we 're in and by the way I certainly won no personal satisfaction in saying that I 've been proven right in anything I don't want that I wish that weren't so I wouldn't   want it to be so \n<$B>  But Gerry hold on   You have repeated it since because at the meeting which followed the nineteen ninety-two general election which you described as the greatest political humiliation in the party 's history you said that the slick spin-doctors, the pricey promoters, the media manipulators had had worked to the disadvantage of Fianna Fa/il and that you 'd prefer to see the party going into opposition but it shouldn't have gone into government\n<$D> I think John it should be very clear and it should be made very clear that the particular comments which you 're attributing to me uh were made at a private meeting of the Fianna Fa/il parliamentary   party \n<$B>  I checked   them with people who were there and\n<$D> Yes yes I I 'm not saying I 'm not denying the fact that at all at all but what I am saying it was a private party meeting where people have an opportunity of saying exactly what they feel and at that time we had lost ten seats in a general election uh and that to me was quite a disaster in the political sense and was a very bad showing And yes it is so It is so that I recommended very strongly and  proposed very strongly that my party would go into opposition at that particular time uh in an effort to benefit from a rest period in opposition but the majority didn't agree with me and I went along with the decision of the   majority \n<$B>  So it 's   going to be allowed to go into opposition\n<$D> I I most certainly believe yes I think it 's going to be a great time for my party in opposition Many of them you know we 'd prefer if we weren't there under the circumstances under which we find ourselves but I am very very uh satisfied to know that we 're going to avail of that time to rebuild our party to strengthen our party to regroup and to put right the wrong Uh it 's like somebody having a boat and puts the boat on the rocks If there 's a hole uh in the boat below the water line you bring it into dry-dock\n\n<$D> I 'll put it very simply to you The fact that the people withdrew their support from it put us on the rocks because we hadn't we had lost our appeal to the electorate and now we 've got to see why uh we 've got to have an in-depth examination as to what went wrong uh and put it right\n<$B> Right I 'll come to you Jim in a minute but I want to first of all go to the audience Sean O'Donoghue who asked the question Yes\n<$E> Uhm I just think that uh someone serving a statement and it being returned and backwards and forwards all the time isn't going to help anything and waiting for the Committee isn't going to help much either cos I think that could run and run and run So the sooner that it 's sorted out the better I don't know what procedure that will require but the sooner the better I think\n<$B> Right yes right at the back over here on the left Yes\n<$F> Very very briefly uh John, Michael Gleeson an a councillor on behalf of South Kerry Independent Alliance a newly-registered party It appears to me and to many that I speak with that the truth in this entire issue is becoming a total variable, and people are disillusioned and confused and that 's a very sad thing for politics That 's point number one and point number two, and I don't want to be hard on Jim Kemmy and he he rationalised his previous statement, but the descent from the moral high ground may prove to be very precarious indeed Thank-you\n<$B> Okay, centre of the middle row yeah sorry back middle row centre Yeah\n<$G> I would like to say Mr Chairman that it is my opinion and I I feel it is the opinion of many people out there looking that with the mess the politicians have allowed themselves to get into and the time that it has taken to sort it out sort themselves out and sort the the others out, that there there, that there is plenty of room why we should be thinking of uh redundancy for the politicians We we we elected them to run the country and this is what they should be concentrating on doing I think In any other job in the country if we were trying to sort ourselves out within the job then <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> wouldn't be long making us redundant", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ed122cce-98f1-4a47-96c3-46de79f22e03", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.264399+00:00"}
{"text": "<Questions Answers 2>\n\n\n<$A> By redundancy you mean somebody else at the next election, Not no politicians Not no   elections \n<$B>  By   redundancy I mean that we could do with a lot less of them that they 're proving it themselves by the time factor they 're taking sorting themselves out instead of running the country\n<$A> Right okay centre row here yes, yeah\n<$C> It 's James Casey Caherciveen, I 'd like to say that it it 's quite obvious that we need the immediate implementation of a Freedom of Information Act and a referendum on cabinet confidentiality Now as recent as uh December fifth last Eithne Fitzgerald made a statement in Killarney saying that, a document on the formation of a uh Freedom of Information Act was well advanced in the office of the Ta/naiste So we should not have to wait more than six to eight weeks for that document to come to the Da/il for debate and be passed\n<$A> Right okay good point that was made here indeed Yes,  third row here yeah,\n<$D> Jim Kemmy there has stated that Labour hadn't got anything to lose But I think that  Labour in fact have an awful lot to lose because it seems to me that what Dick Spring said yesterday he 's pre-judging what is going to come out, on on, at the Committee of Enquiry\n<$A> Right Jim Kemmy,\n<$E> Uhm first of all, can I say about Gerry Collins that I agree fully with his objective uhm uh assessment of that, he has a philosophical detachment, to the question which uh I think is uhm I think in his own context, uh extremely magnanimous of him, He hasn't been partisan here tonight at all Similarly Joe Lee has brought, an academic I suppose, uh viewpoint to bear on it But as far as I 'm concerned uh I have no axe to grind at all I think the speaker in in the audience has said that we need more accountability more openness, regard regarding politicians in our country, Even though they are a bit foggied, they are confused by the by the bewildering statements coming out, nevertheless there are better issues or bigger issues involved in this, At the end of the day, I do hope we 'll have a more democratic society, well accountable society These are the issues that are important, Yeah I do understand people in the audience saying, they 're tired of us, They 're impatient intolerant of us, uh waiting so long to form a government, But don't forget just one week ago, uh two thirds of the Irish people in three separate polls wanted a Labour Fianna Fa/il coalition, and we 've responded to that even though it wasn't a black and white, are now <unclear> several sylls </unclear> endeavouring to put together a Rainbow Coalition but that is democracy, In your own private life and in your family life none of us are so perfect that our lives are impeccable\n<$A> And we 've a question on that rainbow uh later on in the programme but now we 're taking two questions uh together They 're both in a sense linked, Dan Neville has the first   Yes \n<$F>  Thank-you   John Uh would the panel agree that, it would be appropriate for an incoming coalition to replace Padraig Flynn at this time,\n<$A> Now would the panel agree that it would be appropriate for an incoming coalition to replace Padraig Flynn as the Irish Commissioner in the European Union at this time, And Paul Coughlan has another question Yes\n<$G> John, should the Senate vacancies be filled by Albert Reynolds or should they be left open to be filled by the incoming Taoiseach\n<$A> Right Can we take the Padraig Flynn question first Joe Lee,\n<$H> Well I think that the commissionership has always been treated as a political football between the parties, and that uh no appointment that hasn't been dominated by political considerations, has been made to that job so far It 's quite true that uh Dick Burke was appointed by Charlie Haughey I think, uh on one occasion but, he didn't belong to Fianna Fa/il but that was certainly governed by political considerations, Uh, I think that, there has to be an agreement between the parties, as to how commissionerships will be nominated in future, if in fact, Mr Bruton or the Rainbow or whatever comes in now is going to depart from the tradition of political primacy, Uh I don't think that it 's reasonable to expect, a one Taoiseach to say, I am now going to institute, different standards unless there can be cross-party agreement on the procedures for that in the longer term Uh I think that, it would be unfortunate in many ways if Padraig Flynn were replaced because he does seem to be, doing a very good job At least that 's the impression we regularly get, that he 's doing a good job, And uh it would be, I think ungracious in a way At the same time the political reality, is that it has been a political calculation all along and we can well see the attraction to John Bruton of uh withdrawing Padraig Flynn and appointing somebody like say Alan Dukes who uh would certainly do an extremely good job, uh who would uh serve his political, needs by getting rid of somebody who might be a bit awkward at home, And therefore you can sever a bird with the same stone  But unless there can be cross-party agreement on the procedure, then uh I think probably it will go along the political route John\n<$A> Right Jim Kemmy isn't it the case that Dick Spring has already been part of a government which nominated, uh the commissioner in Padraig Flynn How could he be part of a rainbow who might change his mind now,\n<$E> First of all John I 'm not too sure whether, it 's within the gift of government to change,   <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  It 's at a very   advanced stage He 's been nominated already He 's been assigned a portfolio and   a very senior one \n<$E>  He has  , He has, And also I agree  with what Joe said, After some initial difficulties Padraig Flynn settled in well, And even he was an unlikely person to be in charge, of the social affairs portfolio, By and large his <unclear> several sylls </unclear> settled in to the job very well and done  fairly well in that area I wouldn't want to take that from him, Mind you, he 'd be a lofty and loose cannon, on the Fianna Fa/il back benches when he 'd return home  , I I I I say Bertie Ahern would prefer  to have him, in Europe as far away as possible from him  That 's my own view\n<$A>  He 'd have to to win the seat first Jim  \n<$A> Gerry Collins you could you could create a seat for him Gerry by the way You 're in Europe now You could design <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and he could stand in Limerick West\n<$I> Well I 'll tell you something I don't think he 'll get elected in West Limerick  But I I do in fairness want to say that Padraig Flynn has an exceptionally high record, of achievement as Commissioner in the European Union That is fact, Nobody can take that from him He 's been extremely successful, uh and that is recognised, Uh he has been reappointed by the, the new Commission President Mr Santer uh to the portfolio which he held an exceptionally important one, Uh and I believe it would be very unwise in the interests of this country to make any attempt to remove him uh from that particular post, Technically it may be possible, but practically I think it would be   extremely unwise Normally Parliament  would 've no difficulty whatsoever in ratifying Padraig Flynn And I would think that he above all the new Commissioners coming before the Parliament in early January for ratification would probably get the greatest approval rating of the lot, I say that, and I know because I watch Mr Flynn when he comes to the European Parliament Uh and I watch how he how how he how he deals with the situation for which he is responsible He 's doing an excellent job, And from a political point of view a narrow political point of view here at home I think we would be exceptionally foolish and unwise even if we could do it, and I 'm not too sure that we can, but we would be foolish and unwise to interfere with Padraig Flynn 's nomination And the fact that he 's already been given a very senior post, which by the way there is no guarantee whatsoever that though the person that might replace him would get that particular post because, there is also another matter that must be taken into account in that equation in that the the portfolio that was allocated for the Norwegians if and when they entered and now they haven't that 's there vacant too So we 'd want to tread carefully uh because you know\n<$A>  Parliament is still to ratify it Isn't it  \n<$A> There might   be a reshuffle in other words \n<$I>  It would be   it would be very unwise and foolish and I don't think this government should do it And I believe as well, that Dick Spring having been a party to that decision, a unanimous decision, then I can't see how he could explain how he would walk away from it like now\n<$A> And what do you make of the argument which some people in Fine Gael might make for instance that Peter Sutherland might 've made a a President of the Commission if Fianna Fa/il had been, uh magnanimous enough to put   a another person in \n<$I>  That my   my my dear, Mr Bowman that was surely nothing other than a political argument put forward for Peter Sutherland because  exceptionally fine man an exceptionally fine reputation, but no guarantee whatsoever that the other eleven member states at at at Prime Minister or President level would agree to he getting the particular   nomination \n<$A>  Right   Avril Doyle the question we 're on is Padraig Flynn Should he be retained or replaced if that were possible by any incoming rainbow,\n<$J> Well I 'm not sure what the incoming rainbow actually will do with Padraig Flynn, but uh if he was removed it 's no reflection on Padraig 's ability nor indeed his record It just reflects the political reality of, government in Ireland   today \n<$A>  Just   for the boys you mean,\n<$J> Indeed it could be part of of negotiation for government You also mentioned the two vacancies in the Seanad Uh I I feel they again could be part of discussion, providing Albert Reynolds the uh acting Taoiseach, can leave government and leave office with some dignity, I do not think they should be filled as a last minute rush   as he rushes out the door \n<$A>  So who 's going to make it Avril Now   you 're having it both ways   You want  the option of putting your person into   Padraig Flynn, and you  think Albert shouldn't fill and take his chance by filling   the two Seanad <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$J>  Yes I am  \n<$J>  Into into the Seanad  \n<$J>  They are they are   two issues that are there for discussion by the negotiators of the present   Rainbow Coalition \n<$A>  But I 'm asking for   your opinion tonight\n<$J> Uh I really don't know I 'm not party to the discussions And the discussions are at a critical and very sensitive stage And what I say tonight and my personal opinion actually could be quite damaging to the overall uh uh resolution uh of of a programme for government with the three parties So I don't think it 's politic for me to say what I personally would like to do But I would hope, that Albert Reynolds would have the grace to leave office with dignity rather than spread the jobs round for the boys as he rushes out the door with the key in his hand And I would just suggest that, you made perhaps the most important point in response to this question in that, rather than Gerry, albeit very temperately uh lecture us on on the political niceties of how this might be handled The point was, that Europe was calling from head-of-state level down to the ordinary punter calling for Peter Sutherland to be nominated uh as our representative last time round And the Fianna Fa/il Labour government chose to ignore that", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3243cbcf-2cc5-4660-9e62-b7ead6fa2e12", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.265352+00:00"}
{"text": "<Questions Answers 3>\n\n\n<$A> Right Anybody else on this Yes fourth fifth row yeah fourth row yeah,\n<$B> I think that the actual timing, of the decommissioning of arms is something that should be left to the negotiators, But I also believe that  eventually they should be decommissioned whether they 're in the hands of Loyalists or whether in the hands of the IRA And I think that if the Loyalists and the IRA ultimately had their arms decommissioned and if those arms weren't going to be used for either political violence or to drift back into the hands of ordinary criminals the RUC may very well consider it unnecessary uh to carry firearms then Because for a time in the seventies the RUC did become disarmed but, I I think it lasted for about six months generally and they had to take their guns back again because they were being shot at You will never see the day I think where you can disarm the British Army  because guns are part of their uh equipment and their raison-d'etre Uh but, if you do have a continued  military presence in Northern Ireland you if you have soldiers from wherever they come whether they 're thirty-two county soldiers or British soldiers you will need them occasionally to come to the  to the aid of the civil power and that may require them to carry arms Indeed it would Uh, they would be most necessary to  uh for the assistance of the civil power if the civil powers themselves to which the  the uh RUC did not themselves carry arms\n<$A> And you speak as a former general secretary of the Garda Representative Body\n<$B> Well, perhaps I I   want that  \n<$A>  No but  , you were that No you wanted to, sort of point out it 's   your \n<$B>  It 's   very much a personal   view  \n<$A>  Jack   Jack Mariner No I appreciate that as well Anybody else on this, Front row here yes\n<$C> Yeah I think that if we go back to the early stages of the Peace Process we had a situation where the definition of the word permanent became very difficult I think that the decommissioning issue could be a ruse again as a slower for the British government who really should take this opportunity of being generous, and moving in a very positive way forward And I think the onus is on them now to take up the slack and to push things quickly and very positively forward\n<$A> Yup Yes fourth row third row here yes, Yup\n<$D> Yeah uhm I think it 's uh it 's interesting to hear people sort of, criticising the British government for not moving quickly enough and we all would like to see them move a lot quicker But I think, we should remember that the British political situation at the moment is such, that uh John Major has to be very careful uh with how he approaches the Unionists because he relies on them for a parliamentary majority at the moment, to a certain extent So he has to be extremely careful I think\n<$A> Right I 'll come back to you now in a second Man behind you yes\n<$E> Yes I I  agree with uh Dr Fitzgerald that uh the foot should be let in very gently on this issue, There should be no form of savage absolutism otherwise I would 've thought the, uh entire Peace Process could be subverted I think it should be handled very gently\n<$A> Nell McCafferty,\n<$F> The audience is just getting round to the nub of the matter, that the British government, dares not rush forward now in case they upset the Unionists on whose vote they are  depending, The fact is as we have seen from Albert Reynolds ' leaks this weekend and as we all know as journalists, from our informed sources, their joint statement or whatever it 's called is is nearly ready It is nearly time now to produce the goods and say everybody in to talks And the British government, at that stage has to say to the Unionists in you all go now And they 'll have to lean on them, And they 're afraid of that And so this discussion about IRA arms is a great way of deferring the evil moment for another few months while John Major wonders can he go for another election can he what can he what They 're just it 's a crunch issue now, A peaceful issue Let us now, say to the Unionists it is time to do the deal and the British government is scared stiff of doing that And that, there we are back to the problem of nineteen twenty-one\n<$A> Dermot Ahern\n<$G> Yeah just,  Nell you mentioned earlier about the uhm, the uh intimidation of of young people particularly uh there 's a study out today of quite interesting results which show that fifty percent of Catholics uh say at least uh who have been surveyed say that they have been uh intimidated This is since the peace fire uh uh cease fire  So you know it it just shows you how fragile,   yes Yes It just shows  you how fragile, uh the the whole situation is And of course the bomb in Enniskillen is another reminder as to how fragile the whole thing is\n<$A>  Of young people Eighteen year olds yeah <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>  \n<$F> No it 's not Youse   are wrong \n<$H>  I think   it 's a mistake to put too much importance on the British government 's dependence for its majority, on the Unionists in Parliament because, in any event they and we depend on the unionists to reach an agreement, And that 's the crucial thing So even if they had a a huge majority in Parliament they would still have to, handle the Unionists carefully and take their time and on a somewhat different timescale to our government here Now I don't fault them for having slightly different timescales I would like to see them, more <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> on handling other problems like the arms and you know uh, not having divergences emerging between them That 's another another day 's work\n<$A> Right We 're going to move on Anne-Marie Lawler, has another question\n<$I> After four days of the foundation of the new government what lifespan would the panel give it\n<$A> Right Four days into the foundation of the new coalition the Rainbow Coalition what life span, Dermot Ahern\n<$G> Well uh I I 'm not sure if I 'd go as far as uh Mary Harney uh went uh when she said it would only last a couple of weeks but then I suppose uh given the events of the last couple of weeks, uh it mightn't be any surprise if uh perhaps in the early in the new year it falls Uhm I think it 's it 's going to be extremely difficult really uh for three parties to to to come to an agreement, on all the major issues that come before them, Uh I think uh Garret who was uh Cabinet a lot longer than I was I was only a couple of months there but you know there is a tendency if difficult decisions come up, uh to to fudge on the decisions and put them back   Uh \n<$A>  That   was your experience wasn't it\n<$G> Well you know it was my experience that if difficulties arose and I I was uh there I I Cabinet confidentiality I suppose would   would make <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Ah it 's out the window now Don't worry   about it  We 're going to have a referendum about it aren't   we, We 'll  anticipate the   results of that and you can feel free to speak \n<$G>  Yeah yes so  \n<$G>  So perhaps   perhaps on Questions and Answers we 'll have the the agenda of the Cabinet and the minutes of the Cabinet in the future but Uhm you know I think there would be a fudging of decisions that difficult decisions that might have to come up Uhm and I think if you just look at even the appointment of Padraig Flynn today uhm it would appear to me that perhaps Labour have won out in the argument already on this issue where it was obvious from from day one even before this government was formed that Fine Gael wanted to uh jettison Padraig Flynn  uh from his position, and uh that Labour in effect felt obliged because they had already made the decision maybe I don't know when it was three months earlier, uh that they couldn't row back on that So I think there 's there 's already strains there I mean if you look at at uh Michael Noonan on on on Saturday uh View, Rodney Rice 's programme, he seemed to indicate to the to the populace that Padraig Flynn was on the way out and yet   John Bruton \n<$A>  No he was   leaving a blank cheque actually   for for his leader I thought \n<$G>  Well I think he was going   very near to saying in effect that uh Padraig was on the way out or on the way back, and uh that uh, that uhm we were going to get a situation perhaps where one of the Fine Gael people were put in But John Bruton put the cap on that this morning I think when he issued a statement saying that Padraig Flynn was going to remain\n<$A> Right Garret Fitzgerald what 's the life span in your view,\n<$H> Eight years possibly \n<$A> Eight years Oh they 'd get through the next election as well and\n<$H> I I think that that people 're missing or Dermot 's missing a couple of points First of all the economic situation, is favoured in, as favoured now as it was unfavourable previously And the kind of difficulties that arise from trying to find   ways to cut spending \n<$A>  Thanks to Fianna Fa/il Garret  , Thanks to Fianna Fa/il\n<$H> Uh thanks to a series of governments of which have dealt with the situation you left behind   in eighty-one and two  \n<$A>  Most most most   of which were made up by Fianna Fail\n<$G> I have the figures in my pocket <#>\n<$H>   Don't waste your time on them, The fact is that we well uh uh don't uh  that 's a silly argument, Uh but the fact is that if all governments have contributed to it We got half-way there You completed the job And it was well done by the two governments together, But the fact is it is a good economic situation There aren't the constraints and difficulties that there were at that time, Secondly uhm, the programme itself, is very detailed, and there 's a lot more in it than was in the original Fianna Fail Labour

{"text": "<It's Friday 1>\n\n\n<$A> And like we must remember all  all over the country I can I know in my own parish at this time of the year we all share in the joyous season but like there are people obviously,  for whom Christmas is a lonely time because, especially for older people They obviously remember the people who are no longer with them, and they remember Christmases past And obviously the older you get you have more Christmases probably behind you than in front of you So I mean obviously people remember people that maybe they 've lost loved ones maybe in nineteen ninety-four or in recent years and obviously it 's very sad if people lose someone coming up to Christmas And I think that 's why just talking to people and meeting people around the Christmas season and not just for the twenty-fifth of December but for the the days immediately after is very very important\n<$B> Right   uh \n<$C>      that 's an  that 's a particularly important point that John brings out, Uh it 's a very emotional time for people in generally but particularly for older people and missing, the people who 've gone before them   And \n<$B>  The empty   chair at the table for   thousands of people this Christmas \n<$C>  Quite so And and   and also mind you you you also make an excellent further point John in in the lull after Christmas, uh which is  which people find quite difficult Although I think, that we in in the Society in in of Saint Vincent de Paul are I suppose particularly concerned about people, and Brendan mentioned this earlier, people out there who need help, who are not asking for it, people who 're falling through the cracks, And we really depend on people in the neighbourhood could be community policemen it could be a  uh a neighbour who would confidentially cos I mean our service like Brendan 's is uh is a totally confidential one, who would give us the nod as it were and say the the lady uh uh living up the road or down the lane or whatever is is uh very lonely Hasn't been visited by anybody for six months It might only be loneliness It could be some need Uh it could be a question of pride preventing her, uh her her him asking for help And that 's what really concerns me\n<$B> And indeed   it 's \n<$C>  People who   need the help who won't ask for it\n<$B> It 's a salutary reminder indeed Two elderly gentlemen died in house fires in County Cork here in the last week and it 's perhaps a time to call as well We 're going to some more music now Again from our friends the Polyphonics and this is, the Coventry Carol\n\n<$B> John, tell me about the farm because your work 's going to go on Christmas Day and every other day but there are traditions and there are memories and it 's obviously a time you enjoy\n<$D> Yeah obviously it 's slightly different probably from the picture painted now in Alice Taylor 's recent book that everything kind of closed down for the twelve days of Christmas The cows are in the stall and you stock up the hay and away she goes Uh obviously you 've had lot of changes in farming practice now Personally we 're not in winter milk, I still have a few cows milking but obviously you 've a lot of people who 've cows calved already at this time of the year But uh like the the the season of Christmas generally speaking would have been a season of kind of slowing down and renewal to be the break in seasons And even, uh you know I can always remember when I was small, uh you know kind of at Christmas time you always gave one of the cows was stalled or the pigs where in whatever house you kind of gave them an extra portion as well coming up to Christmas and at Christmas time you were extra generous with them And personally I I I I have I I believe like that that animals can sense season I now I suppose dogs especially like are very aware but even even farm animals you know They can sense they can sense a lull in activities They can sense a a slowing down in activities Obviously they don't probably know whether it 's Christmas or what the cause for it, is But animals themselves and obviously they 're central to the to the Christmas story and to the history of Christmas so I I I I a on our farm I would  uh always be conscious of the fact that we 're so close to nature So obviously Christmas is about about birth It 's about a very famous birth so obviously every time, do you know whether 'tis uh a calf is born or a lamb is born or whatever it it gives you that sense of of Christmas Obviously if you are farming especially a huge vast scale you just get overpowered and it just goes by clinically and you don't notice it I wouldn't be in that huge scale because I haven't an awful lot of stock So obviously I can see you know a kind of a Christmas happening uh every time that you uh have renewal on the farm you know\n<$B> I don't want to go too far away from it but do people still give names to animals Do they call the cows Do they have names on the cows\n<$D> Yeah like we we would still have a  uh names on a share of them like you 'd have Cronin 's Black and you 'd have Polly and there was a horse won the Grand National there a few years ago we had a cow calved that day I think it was Grit Arse I would have a cow of that name But obviously now you see with milk recording and everything you have yellow sixty-nine and a hundred and forty-eight and you have blue a hundred and eighty-six And that obviously as uh traditional as it was    \n<$B>  That 's the   tags and the year   Yeah \n<$D>  Yeah like   we we we still have a cow now and and and her her great-great-great-grandmother was sold to a cattle dealer from Lisgoul called Jack Heaphy one time And like we always called her descendants then Jack even though that wasn't a great name for a cow  But we still have a I think there 's a great-great-granddaughter of her But obviously you see we with big herds of cows now uh the name,   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  You could call   her Jackie\n<$D> Yeah that 's right yeah yeah Yeah well well whether it 'twould be in deference to Jack Charleton or the late cattle dealer I 'm not sure But obviously with scale now you see and identification of cows and you have so many schemes now with the cows You see if I sent in a list to the Department of Agriculture for the beef scheme and I had Polly and Jackie and Molly and Two Paps and Croopledy Horn you see you could imagine the civil servants sure they 'd they 'd they 'd have a fit like   <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  There 'd be   another tribunal\n<$D> There would yeah There would yeah   yeah yeah \n<$?>  <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> isn't wide   enough to hold these long names \n<$D> Yeah there 's only room now you see for the, three eight six nought   one two \n<$E>  It 's like   everything else   John  becoming more and more impersonal\n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D> Oh it is aye 'Tis yeah 'Tis yeah\n<$E> Just a number\n<$D>   Yeah \n<$B>  What 're   your memories of Christmas Brendan\n<$E> Oh I 've fantastic memories of Christmas Tom I I know, I go back to my my childhood days and that wasn't yesterday uhm, when we 'd be waiting Christmas bed  Christmas Eve night into bed early of course very early in case Santy 'd come and first thing then up in the morning, you were up and waiting for your mother to open the the sitting-room door The sitting-room door was locked cos in there the Christmas tree was with all the presents around it, And uh, the key was in the door and everybody have to be up and ready, before the door was opened And then we 'd all dash in and we 'd be all the excitement of opening our presents, And up til in my time I I have own family myself two boys and two girls and I carried on that tradition, And my daughters, I 've two daughters married today, and they are carrying on that tradition still that the sitting-room door is locked until Christmas morning and then in and presents are opened And I think it 's a nice tradition, And of course Stephens 's morning then we all waited for Stephens 's morning, for to go out with the Wren, You know the Wren I 'll always remember it, when I was young the uhm the old Sarsfield 's Estate where uh the Wilton Shopping Centre is now and so forth that was one of our playgrounds at the time, and then the African Missions bought Sarsfield House and we used go up there and there was a brother up there and if we sang the the uhm the Wren 's song in Irish <&Irish> Dreoili/n a fuaireas-sa </&Irish> we 'd get an extra couple of bob off him for singing it in Irish And it was a great tradition with us always Each uh Stephens 's morning we would wake up early in the morning and faces painted and off out straight away,   getting  our couple of bob And you 'd get a bit of fruit in some houses and so forth But it is a fantastic time for\n<$B>  Right  \n<$?> That 's good It 's a shame, It 's a shame it 's gone You you I watch for it today Every Stephens 's Day I watch to see how many people will come round with the Wren You might only get one in, if you 're lucky calling to the door I think 'tis a shame to see all these old traditions gone\n<$E> 'Tis and I I\n<$B> The most simple and gone in particular areas I suppose media and entertainment and   other options again \n<$E>  That 's the   problem yeah\n<$B> Cashel what 're your own memories\n<$F> Well I think uh one one 's one 's view of Christmas  one has a changing perspective as you grow as you grow older I mean I 'll be quite frank about it When I was young, uh Christmas was a time of receiving rather than giving It was the excitement of of getting gifts the, uh the excitement of Santa Claus and like like Brendan our door too,  would be locked uh uh uh and one would be waiting for it to open But I think you you you kind of develop into a different uhm view of Christmas as you get older and your own children go through that stage and out the other side and perhaps, uhm uh emigrate for example in in my case Three uhm uh three of my four children uh live abroad, And to us now I mean what Christmas really means is is the the children coming home coming home safely and being being a family once again even if it 's only for a few days, But also it 's a question I think of family, family ties being renewed, uhm I was going to say distant relatives coming home but relatives living at a distance perhaps coming home And and uhm, maybe uh uh uh there 's a part of me which says and maybe in every family it 's the case that uh perhaps it 's just as well that Christmas is comparatively   short  because oh,  how long can we stand our adult children and the distant aunts and this uh is another matter We can be sweet and and nice to them over over a short period of time But no to be be serious uh about it uhm uh for us now it is it is the kids returning home It is the family ties being being  renewed and so on\n<$B>  Short", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source":

he 's going to uh, get a welcome audience from young people here in Ireland who perhaps aren't interested in fasting and praying\n<$B> Whatever I certainly can't speak for the Church and I certainly can't speak for the young people of Ireland  Uhm, fasting never did anybody any harm That 's the first thing I 'd say Nor, does prayer do anybody  any harm The other day in West Kerry, a lady around my a woman around my age came to me as the result of a marriage split-up She said to me one good thing it had done for me, her marriage split-up, it had made her conscious of the psalms And she went upstairs, and she brought down the Bible, and she start started reading I think it was from psalm a hundred and seventeen And it did strike me here was a woman in the middle of extraordinary difficulty, and she was, turning to prayer I think everybody 's prayer is their own I don't think you can pass an edict and say, this is prayer I think it 's a very, personal a very private, commodity if I could use that word Regards fasting, I could do with a bit of it\n<$A> Will you be fasting for Lent\n<$B> Well I I 'm often accused of wearing my heart on my sleeve but I 'm making a public national statement here that I 've given up alcohol for lent \n<$A> Oh right well we we 'll come back to you at at the end of Lent,   and <unclear> 3 syllables </unclear> see how  you 've done    that 's a hard one now Dan Dan where you come from Dan in Kerry Yeah \n<$B>  <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>  \n<$H>  <unclear> several syllables </unclear> yes I was going to   to say that in West Kerry it 's a difficult thing to do \n<$A> Lorraine uh I think you 're a Buddhist aren't you Uh do you believe in this sort of thing giving up things for Lent and, self-denial and so forth\n<$C> Okay uh I   suppose \n<$A>  Will   you be doing it\n<$C> I I won't be following it and while I 've never in childhood I never been I was brought up as a Catholic and I never followed in any particular then It never really frightened me or I never felt, never felt any meaning behind it for myself personally Uhm, I  and I suppose that 'd be my answer   to the question \n<$A>  But in in your   faith is there a philosophy of self-denial Are there parts of the year for example   when \n<$C>  There 's   there are yeah There are reasons behind uh self-denial and there are ritually there would be more ritualistic, pieces that would require it But I think that the main point is the understanding behind it and that and what that is And it 's not just denial for the sake of denial where it 's actually a reflection of, the human state and degrees of attachment as   as \n<$A>  You   you almost have to be in  self-denial all the time It 's an ascetic way of life isn't it\n<$C> No I think that 'd be a bit harsh uh, way to understand it and I think a bit narrow But I think that is part of life And I suppose that the underlying philosophy being that, that everybody is seeking happiness and but perhaps doesn't act in ways that promote or invite it And it 's to lead to a deeper understanding of how to maybe,   go up that path \n<$A>  Right   Justine you work in the uh hedonistic atmosphere of uh, Bleak House in Middle Abbey Street where they produce Independent Newspapers  Will you be giving up anything for Lent\n<$D> No I won't be giving up anything but I 'll be, taking up something Uhm, I think the whole idea of fasting for Lent is probably anachronistic and perhaps irrelevant at this stage because, it 's now a way of life to uhm abstain uh uhm you know  this whole idea of the body beautiful Women particularly I think watch what they eat all the time I think there are probably better things we can do for Lent Lent I think uhm you know like Lorraine was saying it 's about concentrating the mind and you know reaching a greater understanding Uhm, I would   hope that at the end of it I would have I will uh  well I don't know if it 's if you would consider it good but I 'm going to do something in my life, to make these forty days different to the rest of the year\n<$A>  So what you 're going to do something good for Lent Is that what  \n<$A> Right And it it will last for forty days but you 're not telling us\n<$D> Except for Saint Patrick 's Day You get an opt-out clause don't you \n<$A> You you 're not telling us eh the   full \n<$D>  I I 'll   tell you yeah I I 'm going to, pray   I 'm going to try  I 'm going to try and pray\n<$A>  Are you  \n<$A> Yeah well that 's really interesting That 's so the Pope isn't wasting his time when he 's asking you to pray \n<$D> He 's wasting his time asking me to fast  , not  asking me to pray\n<$A>  Yes but  \n<$A> Yeah but do you think people will listen to the Pope young people\n<$D> No   Unfortunately  not not in enough numbers no I think at at the stage we 're at in our civilisation I think young people aren't listening to authority figures and they 're especially not listening to the Pope\n<$A>  No  \n<$A> Sure Siraj the uh the Catholic Church has reduced the scale of fasting in uh I think in Lent to two days just Ash Wednesday and Good Friday and it 's a rather limited type of fast You 're a Muslim and you have much more uh serious uh policies in relation to fasting don't you in the   you have Ramadan It 's  it 's far more extensive\n<$E>   Yeah That 's right   \n<$E>  Well it 's for thirty days and it 's a whole month It is during the day time not night-time so night-time you can eat and drink as much as is possible, drink in terms of soft drinks  \n<$A> Sure\n<$E>  Uhm but uh no I mean there 's no leniency as such If you are a Muslim it 's incumbent upon you It 's one of the five pillars of Islam, uh fasting and prayer uh alms-giving as well as pilgrimage and uh giving up uh giving out a certain amount of your income in in terms of uh, uhm   alms  Yeah \n<$A>  Alms-givers  \n<$A> Siraj many Catholics uh traditional Catholics admire the Muslim faith because it 's taking things quite seriously still They feel don't you go along with that   the Catholic Church  made a mistake in uh in a sense watering down all the obligations <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> places on the members of that faith\n<$E>   Oh absolutely   \n<$E>  Well I suppose just quibbling would not be right thing to do that I mean Catholic uh has its own rationale Islam has its own rationale I mean five hundred years after Christianity comes Islam, and when you look at the value that Islam uh in a practical sense be it trying to practise them then it 's sense   to  \n<$A>  What   benefits does fasting bring to you\n<$E>  It oh not only the food or drink as people relate to it It 's your conscience It 's your tongue It 's your eyes It 's your ears So you 're actually purifying, your pollution which you 've accumulated in eleven months So the twelve months one of the months of the year you 're actually cleaning yourself   <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>  \n<$A>  It 's like complete   detoxification of the   system \n<$E>   Complete   detox   detoxification  \n<$A>  Mentally   and physically   and \n<$E>   Absolutely   and and re-honing your thoughts in your system It 's a it 's a month of uh, uh so to speak uh of you know a spiritual reward You read uh Koran You uhm do a lot of good things, and you basically pause and reflect on towards yourself your family your community and entire globe   and  \n<$A>  Brendan   Purcell uh that 's very impressive isn't it I mean uh why did you guys get rid of the fasting from midnight which used to be there,   possibly when  when you were a young fellow\n<$F>  I 'd say  \n<$F> It certainly was <unclear> several syllables </unclear> But I suppose what they were trying to do, I don't know if it worked uh they were trying to do to was to get back to the basics <unclear> several syllables </unclear> reliving your baptism You know you were almost getting reborn again the chance to become a child again and so you went through a kind of ascetic <unclear> several sylls </unclear> so you could die on Good Friday and rise again with Christ on on on on Easter Sunday But I I mean you 're asking the others what they would do but I mean I remember some guy saying to me years ago like you know you know if you 're trying to love your neighbour you know you don't need a hairshirt And I mean I would strike me as my to take your point about   <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Yeah but   that 's not that 's not that 's not the question I asked you I was saying to you did you make a mistake in getting I mean this goes right back to Moses Moses went up the mountain for forty days and forty nights Didn't he\n<$F> Yeah well <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> I mean that was probably one of the reasons particularly forty days It wasn't so much that if you like they were trying to get rid of it They were trying to get people to remember what it was and to choose a bit more In other words we weren't told we couldn't fast right through Lent We weren't told we couldn't <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> People but they really were quite conscious that people were doing a lot of things maybe simply out of tradition They had to do it I mean I can remember days when people moved from the Diocese of Cloyne to the Diocese of Cork cos you could have four biscuits more at night-time\n<$A> Ah come on now\n<$F> They did it\n<$A> Yeah\n<$F> My parents told me that sort of stuff No I mean people moved around\n<$A> They did It 's sort of an  a forerunner of the new licensing laws where   people were  driving over the county line for a drink   Yeah \n<$F>  Absolutely  \n<$F>  Absolutely   but I still want to tell you what I 'm going to do during Lent myself and <unclear> 4 syllables </unclear>   just similar to Justine  I am I am not a great driver as my insurance company and various people know And some of the people <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> already have made a song up for me, uh called the title was Do You Love Everybody When You 're Driving And so I 'm really going to try and put that into action next well like from Wednesday on is when I 'm driving if people cut out on me cos <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> I 'm right and they 're wrong So I really want to make an effort to improve my the way I think of my   <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Oh yeah What are you going to do  \n<$A>  So the   roads 're going to be safer\n<$F> I guess so well certainly around me\n<$A> Professor Laurence Taylor uh you grew up in a a secular Jewish family in New York Did you go go in for fasting or, is there any\n<$G>  No uh is the the short   answer to that  \n<$A>  But there is   is there fasting within the Jewish faith\n<$G>  There is   Yom Kippur  \n<$A>  Yom Kippur  \n<$G>  Yom Kippur is the Day of Atonement Uhm uhm but uhm as I was saying to you jokingly I think sometimes we, think our whole time on on earth is a penance  Can seem that way \n<$A> Only in New York\n<$G>  Uh no no no  Dublin, Dublin matches it any day of the week I 'd   say  \n<$A>  Sure   and what do you think about it Do you think the Irish young Irish people are into fasting and praying anything like that\n<$G>  Well I think you know well I would say young  uh Irish people uh from my perspective uhm teaching, uh I would say the majority not but a significant minority uh would be And in answer to the question whether the Pope 's wasting his time talking about it I would say probably not Uh the evidence is you 're all responding to even uh even a response negative response is a response Everybody 's thinking about it \n<$A> Yeah   Will  you do anything for Lent\n<$G>   Uh   \n<$G>  No uh not in particular \n<$?> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$F> I was amazed at the number the people you 'd see on Ash Wednesday, with, the soot on their, including the Taoiseach\n<$B>   Yeah yeah \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$B>  He he   appears in Da/il E/ireann And Brendan mentioned going from Diocese to  Diocese there was a thing in Cork You know the  the Conny Dodgers\n<$F> Yeah\n<$B> There was a biscuit some company in Cork made during Lent and you 're we 're only allowed a certain number   of biscuits  And somebody made   some company bought  they made a big  a really big biscuit\n<$F>  Lapwing bars  \n<$F>  They weren't sweets  \n<$F> Yeah\n<$B> So that fitted the rule\n<$F> Yeah\n<$B> You were mentioning that I I think I think fasting is just the I think has to be a personal thing I don't think you can impose", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2c1ec4cb-5547-4ee7-aedd-aaef571e80ea", "added":

{"text": "<Midnight Court 2>\n\n\n<$A> Anne, you know uh one of the analysts employed by Sky TV uh Francis Tusa he said, I think this morning, this is the eighth time I 've heard of this town falling in the south  You know, it 's uh, are we getting a lot of propaganda do you think\n<$B> I 'd say that a lot of the reports we get must carry some kind of a health warning I mean we 're seeing the emergence of all kinds of language, decapitation, embedded is the big uh\n<$A> Horrible use of   language \n<$B>  Uh  , uh coming on, you know knowing that I was coming on this programme I did a little bit of background research on this whole embedding concept and we 've discovered that uh it was a public relations woman uh, she works for Donald Rumsfeld uhm   uh  who coined this phrase embedded\n<$A>  Who coined it  \n<$A> Well can can you explain to viewers what   what 's the  difference between an embedded journalist and a non-embedded journalist You 're you 're a non-embedded journalist\n<$B>  Tory Clarke apparently is her name  \n<$B> I think the concept behind or the thinking behind the  the embedded journalists is that uh they, they work within the the sort of the army, the government structure Apparently there are about two, over two thousand journalists working uh in Iraq at the moment and of the two thousand, five hundred are embedded That means they 're embedded within the security forces Uhm apparently they 've got to sign a documentation that, the sort of the ultimate veto of their copy, uh\n<$A> They give editorial   control of their of their copy to a military officer \n<$B>  Control over to the army , over to the army   That 's correct\n<$A> That 's disgraceful isn't it\n<$B> So that for me an embedded journalist is a compromised journalist Now I have to be careful and  and say at the same time, that you can't say that every journalist that is working uh you know within that military, with the confines of the military structure, you know, are compromised because I know there are people that are trying to get stuff out but I do think that   it 's something \n<$A>  Do you think it 's worse   this time than has previously been the case say in Afghanistan or in Gulf War One or, you know, is the degree of control greater this time\n<$B> I think it perhaps is Apparently the whole of the background to the whole embedded thing was that they were not going to allow the kind of things that happened in Gulf War One happen in Gulf War Two and that apparently\n<$A> Sorry can you, can you, can you explain that, what sort of things\n<$B> That I think that you had too, apparently Rumsfeld 's greatest fear is to have, or the Pentagon 's greatest fear is to have what they called free-wheeling independent journalists These are the kind of journalists like ourselves or myself and a few other people that kind of wouldn't have a huge big machine behind them, but that would go   out  Mind you it 's getting more difficult to do that now because insurance costs after Nine-Eleven   are so enormous that you can't do that   But uh I mean an  an independent journalist, like say for example this morning 's uh London Independent like somebody like Bob Fisk, will give you a completely different view and slant on the story,   that you may get from Sky or some of the other \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  That 's right, you can't, you can't get insurance Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah and, I think, you know   a lot of people for example in Ireland can get international TV coverage from different channels They 're getting a different picture aren't they uh from the one we 're seeing here in Ireland and in Britain, if you switch on say German television, or Khalid I think you can get some Arabic TV   Is that right \n<$C>   Well there are   some uh Arabic satellite TVs The reality about the media damaging western opinion is very much controlled by uh the dictatorship regimes there and uh well in Iraq uh I don't think you, you could believe them They have a very huge uh propaganda machine Uh you will tell, they will tell you something and the the reality is something else \n<$B> But Khalid for example in America, I mean I went to the peace march by the way in in town yesterday and there was an American woman, I think she actually appeared, Mary van Lieshout on this programme, and she spoke about uh very passionately about uh the fact that American public opinion, that there 's a lot more people against this war in the United States   than has been reflected \n<$A>  Yes, a hundred thousand marched   in New York yesterday I believe\n<$D> That 's really true\n<$D> Yeah I 've been reading\n<$A> Mary\n<$D> I 've been reading stories that apparently people are being arrested in America for wearing T-shirts, some guy was picked up in a shopping mall for wearing a t-shirt with Give Peace a Chance\n<$A> Do you think we 're getting a true picture You 've actually been to Afghanistan I think haven't you, Mary\n<$D> I have indeed yes yeah But just to to follow up on Anne 's point there, I was in the States myself a couple of weeks ago and I think that was really apparent when when you look at what was being shown on Fox, on CNN, versus what I was hearing from people that I was talking with in the States, they were two very different things Uhm and there was even a lot of concern about what was being heard on the on the public national radio Uhm you know that it just was not representing the the feelings of the people And American people, a lot of them are very frustrated by this\n<$A> Yeah but what of the actual coverage of the war itself What do you think about that I mean when you see pictures of missiles going into uh sites but you don't actually see the the   incredible  suffering and fear that maybe is being created   underneath \n<$D>  Yeah I suppose  \n<$D>  Yeah I   I find that very difficult to watch personally myself to be honest, because, I think it 's just bringing an infotainment uh kind of angle to the situation <{  and \n<$A>  Do you think it 's like a form of entertainment almost \n<$D> I I do because, and and I see how people react to that even sometimes against their better judgement without maybe stopping to think, about what they 're actually watching And you know I I 've heard people on the radio too saying you know well I 'm a military strategist so I 'm commenting on that but I 'm, you know, ignoring almost the human impact Now that I find very difficult to listen to or to watch You know you see people, journalists reporting from the various aircraft carriers or wherever they may be\n<$A> But these are the embedded journalists\n<$D> These are the embedded journalists exactly But you know, people don't always remember that when they 're watching\n<$A> Yeah they don't uh filter it, looking at it from that   point of view  Terry Leyden uhm you 've built up many contacts in the Arab world over the years What do you feel about what you 're seeing Do you feel that it it 's depersonalised and that it 's not telling us the full story of what 's been done to Iraq\n<$D>  Yeah and  \n<$E> Well the first victim of every war is the truth And this is the situation I 've been watching this on many television stations from Fox to CNN to Sky Every station has a different aspect to the war The war is uh war that should have been prevented Well you know fourteen forty-one, the government were totally opposed to the war taking  place in the first place and we 're not participating in the war But in commenting on the war at this point in time it 's it 's very serious what 's happening at the moment Basra seems to be have been taken on many occasions but seems to be secured as the port city Uh\n<$A> Yeah I mean what what are we to make One day we 're told Basra 's taken, or this town Um Qasr has been taken eight   times  But apparently there 's still resistance going   on </2> This afternoon they 're saying uh you know they don't want to take Basra, because they don't want to put troops into the streets in case they 'd be attacked What do you what do you believe\n<$E>  Yeah well  \n<$E>  I heard  \n<$E> I heard John Simpson this morning from the BBC and he expected it would be a far faster war, it would be more settled, there would be a better reception from the coalition troops than they 're getting directly from the south of Iraq at the moment\n<$C>  Well you have a lot of pockets and these pockets are the members of the Ba'ath parties, the Ba'ath party and you know special forces and they share with Saddam the  the collective guilt of killing the people of Iraq I mean \n<$A> But do you think they will fight   The Ba'ath Party \n<$C>   Well uh   well well those who committed crimes against the Iraqi people, the security forces, uh those who are uh the special republican guard, I believe to a degree many of them they are going to fight for Saddam for a while until they feel it 's uh hopeless Uh I pray that they are not going to obey the order from Saddam to use uh his uh weapons That is uh very vital for the safety of the Iraqis \n<$A>   Alright Doctor Pasabi, yeah  \n<$E>  I think in fairness, in fairness   I feel that we are getting a good return from giving, having, having Richard Downes and Mark Little, Charlie Bird there in the   region  Yes they 're not bedded down with any of the groups involved\n<$A>  For RTE <unclear> several sylls </unclear> in different parts of Iraq  \n\n<$A> Well it would be impossible to bed down Charlie Bird in any case\n<$E> Well I think that 's right but I , in fairness, what 's, we 're getting I think very balanced views from the war and in fact there, there 's total confusion even on the ground out there at this point Eamonn   The  difference of this war and the Second World War is that we 've now direct access to the battlefield whereas <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and other stations will have it a week later It 'll be all processed I was watching, I was watching direct   I  was watching direct combat this morning on the front line\n<$A>  For sure  \n<$A>  Three  \n<$A> Three journalists have been killed today as well   so we <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$E>  Yeah three Terry Lloyd, Terry Lloyd has lost his life   Yeah Terry Lloyd has lost his life and other, his back-up teams are ordered, I watched this morning on one of the major stations the fighting on the ground, with the embedded journalists being shown live and it was like a re-enactment of the Second World War\n<$A> You, a member of your family is out there   in the  serving with the allied forces\n<$E>  Yeah my my  \n<$E> Yeah my nephew Sean Leyden joined up after eleven-nine, like many young Americans He 's only twenty-seven years of age He 's out there at the moment on the battlefront and we 're all concerned about him, as other, two young men from from my village, Ernie and Brian Mulherne are senior members of the American troops who are now underway at the moment I uh we 're all concerned But we 're also concerned about the uh Iraqis who are dying, the children, we 're, this is a war that should have been prevented And I mean I I say this\n<$A> You say that, that 's the second time you 've said that, but we 're the only country out of the European Union that hasn't really got a clear position on the war\n<$E> Oh we have a very clear position I mean the resolution\n<$A> Well not as clear as France\n<$E> The resolution, no that 's not correct The resolution was passed by the Government by one hundred and two votes in both houses of the Oireachtas to seventy-five which clearly stated that the Government  will not participate in the coalition 's proposed military action against Iraq It went through on a long resolution   I think people should read \n<$A>  Yeah but, come on,   we 're we 're we 're neutral for the allied forces aren't we\n<$E> No no People should realise that this resolution, should read the resolution passed by the Oireachtas, the Oireachtas, and the government have passed this resolution It 's the view of the Irish people expressing democratically, in the Oireachtas, and by the government",

{"text": "<Questions Answers 4>\n\n\n<$A> Right coverage of the Iraq war has been described as media pornography What does the panel think John Bruton\n<$B> I I would think first of all that war is one of the most horrible experiences that humans can inflict on one another And therefore seeing the full horror of war is actually an appropriate thing to happen in the media Uh if people are objecting to the sights of the results of violence I think they 're wrong to object to it Uh so I wouldn't describe it as media pornography although I must say I haven't seen that much of it myself My own uhm view is that generally speaking the presentation of the of the war has been reasonably fair particularly on, I would say, RTE and BBC\n<$A> Mm John O'Donoghue\n<$C> Well I suppose it has been widely said hasn't it in the past that the first uh casualty of war is the truth And I suppose it has also been said that the victors get to write the history of wars The fact that there are so many journalists uh at the coalface in relation to this war is of immense importance I think in general terms that uh what we are uh seeing on our screens is quite frightening, the reality the immediacy, of war has been brought home to people forcibly In that context I think though that it is important that uh we have accuracy And I think that uh competing media organisations uh has led to a situation where very often now we find that the rush to be first very often means that  accuracy is sacrificed\n<$A> But how do we know it 's accurate I mean do you believe what you 're seeing I mean what you 're seeing on your screen is obviously a form of truth but it is also selected by somebody, access is given by one of the belligerents probably in each, in many cases So how do we know that, how can we know what to believe\n<$C> Well I think that uh certainly there has been a certain amount of uh misinformation and disinformation We 've certainly seen the rush to be first cause accuracy to be sacrificed, for example in the case of Um Qasr which seems to have been captured now four or fives times at least by the US UK allies Then we 've seen uh the story of thirty oil fields burning in southern Iraq and suddenly it becomes ten or eight So I would say that uh what we see and what we hear does have to be looked upon very coldly I 'm greatly minded of uh the inscription over William Butler Yeats 's uh grave uh, Cast a cold eye on life and death, horseman pass by\n<$A> Sheila O'Flanagan\n<$D> Well I think uh it was clear from from the outset that the media was going to play quite a big role in in this war Uhm before the conflict ever started uhm we saw journalists being embedded in units, and I mean I think that has meant that the reportage coming back from those has had a particular slant and I 'm not trying to say that there 's anything wrong with what the reports are like coming back, but obviously if someone is living and and working with a group of people they 're going to take on uh the aims of that group of people so I think that that 's been an an issue Uhm it was said that the set behind General Tommy Franks cost two hundred thousand dollars to construct, which obviously means that the US are trying to  portray a particular uhm image Uhm a friend of mine talking about it today said to me, it was a little bit like watching reality TV It was like being brought into some kind of Big Brother type situation where you 're watching all the protagonists, where soldiers are doing a job and then suddenly a journalist will come up to them and say, and how do you feel about this Uhm and it 's quite a different thing I think to to almost anything else I 've experienced on TV I find the twenty-four hour news channels, because they have to put on something for twenty-four hours, are showing you the same thing over and over again And the impact of that, while horrific, at the same time I do think is is obscene I mean I saw Baghdad being bombed, I don't know how many times, and each time it seemed to me worse than the last And there was one uhm particular image, I think it was yesterday, where there were some ground troops who were firing on a sniper position, and uh they they fired the first missile and it missed its target And then they fired the second missile and it hit the target And as it hit the target they 're whooping and hollering and and shouting and cheering And I can see from their point of view why they 'd be doing that But at the same time you 're thinking to yourself, it 's hit that target and the people in there, they may have been firing at those soldiers, but the people in there have been killed And it 's quite horrific to see that and know that that 's happening while you 're watching\n<$A> Right  Maura Quinn\n<$E> I think that obviously the media have a very important role to play in the current war in Iraq uhm but I suppose I have a very jaundiced view of the accuracy of a lot of the reports\n<$A> And what is that role in your view\n<$E> Well I think they have a a job to tell us what 's exactly happening on the ground but I think certainly uhm when you watch various different media reports as the Minister had quite rightly pointed out, the accuracy of some of the reports coming through I think you know is very suspect Uhm I think clearly it 's very difficult for the journalists who are actually in in Iraq currently to get out accurate information because certainly I would be aware of the controls that would be in place there on those journalists But I think equally I find the, I find it actually quite obscene uhm the reports from the journalists who are actually embedded with the troops I mean the idea of uhm journalists fronting reports wearing army flak jackets and talking about our boys are doing this, I think is quite obscene And I think that there probably hasn't been enough coverage on the humanitarian aspect of this war, and on the fact that last Friday night we were watching bombs dropping at such a rate on Baghdad and the human cost and the psychological cost for the people in Baghdad\n\n<$A> Doctor Tom Clonan is with us uh military analyst former soldier What is your professional read on the  on the shape of the war and the course that it 's taken\n<$F> Well I think there are two possible outcomes here Uh one is based on the predicted outcome, that when confronted by uhm surgical strikes, to coin the the the phrase, uhm high-tech weaponry, that the people of uhm Baghdad would uh oust their own leadership Uh that being the case the war will end will end quickly The other scenario, and one which appears more likely, is that there has been an  antithetical outcome or an unpredicted outcome where in fact the show of force on the part of the Americans has actually galvanised support for the defenders of Baghdad If that 's the case you may see an intifada in Baghdad of   unprecedented proportions, and a fight that will draw Americans into the city and rob them of their technological advantage And I actually think\n<$A> This is not in the American script is it\n<$F> No And I actually think that this could be a war where everybody loses Where there will be no winners That the Americans will have to colonise by armour, street by street, and in the process will destroy the city, kill its citizens, and everyone 's going to lose in that kind of a scenario\n<$A> But could they even sustain that uh that at home, with the public opinion at home given the the rate of casualties which would be considerable if they were drawn into such a\n<$F> They can They actually have sufficient numbers now They 've reached critical mass, and as we speak uhm you know we 're seeing images of uh fire fights at Nasiriyah and Najaf and Karbala What they 're doing is preparing a one hundred and twenty kilometre front, behind which they have battle space wherein they can now manoeuvre their formations for the final assault on Baghdad So they can actually go in and level the city, but\n<$A> Well that 's hardly victory, that 's hardly liberating, Baghdad\n<$F> Well that 's war and it 's happened before and there are precedents for this They did it, the Americans did it\n<$A> But in a television age could they call that liberation\n<$F> They did it in nineteen sixty-eight in a television age to the city of Hue\n<$A> Not television on this scale\n<$F> Certainly\n<$A> This is different isn't it <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$F> Yeah I understand that But I think uh if they do that they 're going to have major, I mean what I 'm saying is they can do it They do have sufficient combat force mobilised to do it But I think if they do it there 're going to be thousands of casualties and I think that you 're going to find Blair 's leadership under severe pressure I don't think Bush will get re-elected for a second term under those circumstances So it will actually be a war where everybody loses\n<$A> Mmm Yeah yes Man behind you there\n<$G> When they went into Hue, they lost that war That was the Vietnam war and I think uh the question of how long uh this war will take, can't really be answered without taking into account the role of the opposition The opposition to this war is international and it 's massive Uhm I think in lots of the commentaries about the war it 's as if the only players involved are Iraqi troops and American troops The reality in Iraq at the moment is the Iraqi people seem to hate the Americans and the British more than they do the dictatorial regime of Saddam Hussein, and with good reason There is a long history of British and American uh imperialism in the Middle East carving up the area for their own uh interests in particularly the oil, but also just in the domination of that part of the globe like they wish to dominate the rest of the globe And I think uh the portrayal uh as was commented uh earlier on, in the media of the opposition has been very poor You 've no-one on your panel from the uh opposition movement and it 's huge and it 's international In the Vietnam   war which you raised \n<$A>  Our panel, our panel    is not pro-war if that 's your point\n<$G> Well two of your speakers are pro-war Uh John O'Donoghue is pro-war and your American Republican friend is pro-war Uhm and uh I mean John Bruton would 've said that if the UN had voted for the war he would have  rowed in behind it and the bombing of Baghdad with UN approval   would in some way have been different \n<$B>  Sorry I don't I don't think you should say   what I should have said in any circumstances I I made it clear from the beginning\n<$G> I did want to make\n<$B> Sorry sorry now you 're misrepresenting me uhm\n<$G> Sure\n<$B> Uh if you read my speech in the Da/il you will see that I said that I believed that this war with or without UN approval, was disproportionate, that the threat that it was intended to eliminate was not sufficiently great to warrant the loss of life that this war would 've would 've created", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "6a529ee4-0864-4285-a00e-c70ee36f055a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.270452+00:00"}
{"text": "<Questions Answers 5>\n\n\n<$A> And that we 're seeing that at at a period when the British Government so far does not seem to be moving with any real speed with any real sense of where it 's going Uh and it seems to be putting up the question of arms as though it 's a hurdle to be got over before substantive political talks can start I think anybody with any notion of Irish history can see that there 's been no point in any of the the transitions from armed struggle to politics by any party whether that 's Fianna Fa/il whether it 's more recently uh the Official IRA, whether indeed it 's the Ulster Volunteer Force uhm you know if you if you look in the early part of the century nobody has ever come to a point at which they said right we 're now once and for all and forever giving up the arms and we 're completely political There 's always been a period in which those questions have been open It seems to me those questions has to be left open and that political talks should begin in the meantime and it seems to me also that it 's quite urgent that that starts happening now because we really are seeing signs uh that this process could be in trouble\n<$B> What Enniskillen you think for instance\n<$A> Well yes I mean uhm clearly the planting of a bomb nobody seems to know quite who has done it, uhm but it it 's a very serious act It isn't like uhm the the previous terrible shooting in Newry which did have the appearance of being something that nobody had actually planned or set out to do If you put a bomb somewhere you have to sit down and plan that We don't know who 's responsible but clearly there are a lot of dark horses around There are a lot of people who would quite happily disrupt this process uh and really uh you know   it 's \n<$B>  And they   could be coming from anywhere in the spectrum,   couldn't they \n<$A>  Could come from   anywhere I mean even possibly from, from forces of the state, from rogue forces uh in the British state itself We really don't know uh and we have to be very very careful with that but what seems to be critical is uh that substantive political talks and not just talks about talks begin between the British Government and Sinn Fe/in\n<$B> With the arms issue at the top of the agenda\n<$A> With the arms issue there as one of the the uh the parts of the agenda but but again it has to be recognised that the issue of arms is not simply a question of the IRA The the question of arms is in itself complex It 's a question uh also of of the president of of of the British Army uhm basically it 's a question of I mean there were photographs in some of the British newspapers over the weekend for instance uh of the UDA uhm out on patrol you know in uniforms with arms There are arms on a lot of different sides and that process clearly has to be handled with some delicacy but if you simply put up for each side of that this kind of direct hurdle that you must give up the arms before you begin uh substantive political talks then it seems to me that that the process could be in very serious trouble\n<$B> Nell McCafferty what is your view You were in Derry over the weekend What 's the view there\n<$C> Uh I take it that question refers to the arms held by the IRA\n<$B> Uh well it it refers, yes it refers to the arms held by the IRA as a prerequisite for involving them in inclusive talks\n<$C> Sinn Fe/in, It 's uh a silly stance to take in the first place As we all know, the IRA has no intention of decommissioning arms until a political  solution has been arrived at It 's a perfectly sensible and serious way to go about matters First you stop the guns and speaking as a Northerner, sitting down here, it 's a smashing thing to sit in Northern Ireland for the first time in twenty-five years We 're all happy and we don't believe we 're going to get shot You then ask yourself why were those guns ever used in the first place how do we avoid it now and you bring about a political solution And then when the political solution is there you turn round to the British Army and say put away your guns, to the RUC to the IRA and to the Loyalists and that they will do I don't know anybody wants to start a war I don't even know anybody insisting at this moment on the decommissioning of arms The British Government indicated over the weekend they 've changed their stance, that they 'll settle for some kind of uh, suggestion or recognition that of course with the political solution in place the arms will be decommissioned, They 've got that, The IRA I think has,   uh <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  Now what they say   what they said is that they would need verification that the arms had been decommissioned\n<$C> No no they 've gone further beyond that They want an  indication that such will be done Just as the IRA wants an indication that the British will decommission their arms and that the RUC will be disarmed That all sounds perfectly logible logical to me, There 's no need for every   body to get uh upset about it \n<$B>  But but but that equals   a  That actually equals a pacifist state at the end of the day I mean\n<$C> Wouldn't it be wonderful\n<$B> It but have you, can you give an example of it in history\n<$C> I can't uh I mean the pacifist state business worries me because as you say I was in Derry over the weekend and I saw the future and I did get worried as I say it was There 's a uh Lundy was being burned The Unionists were out again celebrating their history or commemorating it For the first time in twenty-five years the shops remained open, the City Gates remained open People were walking about Things were grand And then the RUC intervened, For example they said to me I couldn't go and watch Lundy as a journalist they wouldn't accept my press card They said where 's your camera I said I 'm not a photographer they said where 's your dictaphone I said I haven't got a dictaphone and they ordered me to move on in case I 'd be arrested I said I 'm making a complaint, I ended up down at the police station at nine o'clock in the evening I walked into the police station and the public area there 's twenty young people there aged from about eighteen to twenty-four They had been in a minibus, hired a minibus to go across to Donegal to dance because we 're afraid of the drink-driving laws in the North, We 're very conscientious,   The RUC \n<$B>  And what about   the drink-driving laws in Donegal\n<$C> The RUC pulls the minibus in off the road All the young people are chuntered into the police station The driver is taken away for questioning they 're sitting there the young people saying why is this being done to us The driver is released but I looked at the RUC and I looked at the young people as the police said you can go now And I saw those young people looking at the RUC and saying who are these people They aren't the ones in charge of us And I thought back twenty-five years ago I faced the RUC Then they only had a revolver These young people faced the RUC on Saturday there 's no IRA no British Army nobody And they faced an RUC that had revolvers, rifles, machine guns, armoured cars They 're facing what is not a police force but a legalised paramilitary group that does not know how to be a police force so there 's just intent on doing battle And I said to myself if they don't arrive at a solution, over the next five years, then the next generation is gonna look and say what has been done to us It is extremely worrying but this I would say, the ceasefire will hold, No problem There will be no resumption of war The British Army doesn't want it The government doesn't want it the British Government, IRA doesn't want it Sinn Fe/in doesn't want it The  Irish Government doesn't want it so would they stop talking about the guns and start for once talking about a solution\n<$B> Right Dermot Ahern What 's your opinion on this\n<$D> Well you you forgot to mention the people don't want it I think the people on the ground don't want the war to to resume Nell\n<$C> I am the people Dermot\n<$D>  You 're one of the people You 're one of the people Uhm just on this issue of the arms uhm I think if you listen to what uh John Bruton and Proinsias de Rossa have said over the last number of days they 've to a certain extent changed their stance Uh when they were in opposition they were saying that uh you know the arms should be given up before any political talks but uh even Proinsias de Rossa yesterday mentioned this phrase of you know that it 's up to politicians to ensure that the uhm arms remain silent and I think that 's really the the nub of of of what is up to the politicians now because for twenty-five years we 've had this mayhem uh we have to a certain extent convinced those who were perpetrating that uh to come in into the democratic fold and it 's to keep them there and that 's what we should be concentrating keeping them in, in at the talks And we have to be pragmatic about it I mean if all the arms are are given up uhm uh that the IRA have and that the the Loyalist paramilitaries have at the moment there 's nothing to stop them from buying more arms uh in the years to come So you know I think we have to be pragmatic It is one of the most crucial issues in the whole thing just as the amnesty for prisoners and the re-integration of people who were previously involved in   in violence \n<$B>  But but   who else will go to the talks The Ulster Unionists say they there 's no way they can go to the table and retain their   credibility  and talk with Sinn Fe/in if they are guns under the table as   they would put it \n<$D>  But if you  \n<$D>  Yes but if you listen   to to Roy Magee who who in effect is representing you know the former Loyalist paramilitaries or you know he 's one of the people who has\n<$B> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>   Yeah \n<$D>  Yes   But he makes the point and you you know you might as well be listening to to Gerry Adams speaking when you hear him Basically he 's saying that you know that there has to be a pragmatic solution in regard to the uh arms both on both sides but that uh it it shouldn't be made a pre-condition because in effect you 're coming to a full stop You will come to a full stop I think we have to be pragmatic and I think most of the politicians who were involved in the in the process and I think John Bruton and Proinsias de Rossa now that they 're in government realise that it 's while in opposition you can call for for for these things to be done In government it 's extremely difficult when when the whole scenario 's explained to them properly\n<$B> Yes Proinsias de Rossa said the arms should fall silent let them kind of rust away John Bruton was saying it 's important to resolve this not to get into a standoff about it He 's a more neutral But it did that But in both cases it 's a change\n<$D> Yeah Yeah\n<$B> Derek Murphy who asked the question What 's your own opinion\n<$E> Well I think we 've all appreciated over the last three months the peace that is there now and the potential of the peace in the future and I think to put a prerequisite on it may help to destroy it considering what we saw last night and considering what Fintan O'Toole said about the history There has been no history of the handing over of arms in the past if you go right back I think it 's a very sensitive issue and it has to be dealt with that way", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2a942e56-8953-4b39-baae-2881fd6fcc7f", "added":

{"text": "<It's Friday 2>\n\n\n<$A> Yeah as to the first point Tom yes we do we find people do get caught up in debt and they tend to borrow to pay the debt and borrow to pay the what they 've borrowed to pay the debt, Uh but there the the this MABS programme has been extremely successful and Brendan and and his co-workers are doing wonderful work and there 's a very strong liaison as between themselves and the society, But to your second point Christmas uh of course is is is a time a stress, is a time of joy but it 's also a time of stress But uhm whereas undoubtedly it is a time where there 's considerable expense placed on parents particularly those on the margin uh all kinds of the obvious types of stress whereby for example kids wanting toys that their mother can't afford and this type of thing Nonetheless, it is but one peak in in in a series of peaks that we 're now noticing and  that are not necessarily new Christmas yes is a big one, That 's true, But the time of Confirmation and Holy Communion are others Holiday time yet another, and an increasingly difficult burden for people to bear is the back-to-school time where they have uh clothes for the children in some cases expensive uniforms and the increasingly expensive uh textbooks uh which themselves uh are seen to be changing at a fairly rapid rate Now I know there 's curriculum development and you need to have changes in text books but  there 's more than that to it So whereas Christmas, in some way Christmas is an important time and is a difficult and expensive time for parents uh so also may be the other times But there 's another factor with regard to Christmas that probably makes it more more stressful and that is there 's a tremendous uhm uhm advertising uhm uhm uh stress or campaign Television advertising putting an putting an enormous amount of of of of uhm, uh pressure on parents for buying expensive toys for kids and so on The kids see the advertising and so on and this is a change uh that is relatively new and in to to this current generation to an extent compared with say our our own generation where there was not television and there wasn't the same stress and parents are caught in a very very difficult situation It 's very hard for them to deny their children uh toys and and and treats at Christmas and uhm it 's a tough time\n<$B> John Ireland how do you see that Because there are those today expensive expectations aren't there\n<$C> Yeah uh obviously and like what I have seen in the last few years especially from the point of view of commercialism and advertising on TV and radio and the papers and everything is that Christmas is creeping back and back and back Not the joy and the spirit of Christmas but the the sales pitch and buzz of Christmas I mean traditionally the eighth of December, the church holiday was sort of the beginning of the Christmas season but now like it has crept back into mid-November\n<$B> As soon as Halloween is over\n<$C> Exactly it 's nearly on you And obviously like it places parents and everybody really in a very difficult position and especially as Cashel said like the the way advertisers especially on television obviously have used you know them, the central, one of the central points of Christmas that is that children get presents the way they have targeted in on children and obviously like it puts fierce pressure on parents from children And like children 'tis no good explaining to children that Santa hasn't had a pay increase in the last ten years and that he can't afford to bring extra toys I mean like it 's all down to media pressure now and obviously if Johnny next door 's getting a Double Nintendo Super XYZ like the other child wants you know a Treble Nintendo XYZ with Power Rangers on top of it And obviously it 's putting fierce pressure on and I wonder you see we 're probably we 're only now in our second generation of television watchers So obviously like it 's it 's a new pressure I mean people that are sixty years old plus never knew what it was in in when they were children or when they were growing up or what television pressure meant and you see I don't think we 're probably properly educated how to deal with it because I mean people going to secondary school and national school now media studies and everything is only in its infancy So we we don't really know how to cope with pressure I mean when you hear people talking about oh did you see such a thing on television and such a thing was advertised and if children now practically their needs and their wants are dictated to by television rather than what you know that a child we 'll say long ago said I 'd like something because they 'd personally like it Now they like something because it looks glamorous on television it looks good and it 's in a grand box and because the child next door saw it on television and he wants it you know It takes away a bit from the simplicity of Christmas obviously\n<$B> Right We 're going to pick up this discussion again in a few moments You are listening to It 's Friday The good news by the way as well is that he has loaded up The bags are packed I saw him heading off this morning and just getting the last few bits and pieces so he will be calling and uhm I hope you 're good It 's It 's Friday from Cork oh two one three double one two double two if you want to talk with us Right now we take a break\n\n<$B> Welcome back to It 's Friday Well we 've been talking about money for a while now but the one side of that that 's there that perhaps we should acknowledge as well Brendan Roche is that of giving and the spirit of generosity that pervades the this festive season\n<$D> Yeah I think Tom <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> that the giving aspect here in this country fascinates me always you know I 'm what I 'm twenty-seven years at at the money business now and uh always at Christmas time especially You have this great sense of uh community spirit in the people that if one is down the others 'll see that they won't be down for long And only quite recently now I was walking through a shopping mall here in town and I got a shout from a gentleman and he said you know I 've a beautiful bicycle for a nine year old Almost new Would you be prepared to use it for someone I said no problem I 'll get someone to take that alright And when I collected the bike the on the previous the following night uhm onto the saddle of the bike was strapped an envelope with forty pounds inside it to buy food for people And that 's just one incidence of many many people that come to me And I 'm I 'm not Vincent de Paul as such but I have been established <unclear> several sylls </unclear> as well as being in the money advice and budgeting service for so long that uhm people come to me and say look do you need something for somebody We can give it And I think it 's a great, it 's a great sense of community spirit that we have here in this country If you go across the water even you 'll find that you live as an individual And you could be down and out but you stay down and out but here you won't for long if you 'll make it known And as I always say there 's no need for anybody to starve in this country and if your pride won't allow you ask, it 's a false pride, You must be prepared to get up and ask if you need food\n<$B> Right You obviously experienced that same kind of generosity in the Vincent de Paul Cashel\n<$E> Ah yes we do Christmas uh is a time of generosity as you said at the outset of this part of the discussion People are in a giving mood and we are very fortunate to be beneficiaries of this Uh and and indeed they 're very generous Cork people in particularly I think are very generous to charities like Vincent de Paul, Simon, Share, and and so on And and with good cause We we we 're doing the charities collectively, uh I 'm we 're we 're but one We 're we 're perhaps the oldest, but uh are doing very good work and doing very essential work Uh some would say we 're doing some of the government 's work in in housing homeless people and feeding hungry people, paying off debts to people who are not adequately remunerated or remunerated at all, Uhm but nonetheless it it is it is a good time We 're very dependent on people 's generosity through the year but Christmas particularly perhaps twenty twenty-five percent of our total annual income would would arise at at Christmas time as a matter of fact\n<$B> And you were also saying just during the break that there 's a community support network if the family one has spread out a bit and and and been diluted in some way the community support is there\n<$E> I think there is evolving a kind of a different even if slightly more remote support system replacing the kind of the the the extended family of of old to kind of a wider supporting net, the community as a whole Uh with uh considerable help I might say of the various uh elements of the media which is making known the the problems of people and giving us an opportunity such as today and many other times of making known the needs of people and what support systems are there So I think there is yeah a looser and a newer kind of network uh that we 're experiencing at the moment\n<$B> One often sees that particularly in rural areas as well John if if there is a particular problem or a difficulty a house fire for example or something like that that there is a great rallying around isn't there\n<$C> Yeah there is obviously like it gets back to probably you know <&Irish> ar sca/th a ce/ile a mhaireann na daoine </&Irish>, in everybody 's shadow everybody else lives basically and if 'twas over 'twould be very sad for Ireland for <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> but for the whole country in general if that uhm faded away completely Obviously in a rural setting it 's uh helping neighbours and everything uh isn't to the same degree as it was heretofore because obviously now you 've so much mechanisation and you 've so little you know lack of manpower But still obviously needy causes could as Brendan said once they 're made known but obviously public manifestations like like tragedies or like fires or problems that way are very well helped and obviously at Christmas again like that that is one aspect of Christmas which I I really love and that is the whole aspect Cashel said of giving to charities and everything but it 's also I suppose the basic idea of you know it was the Three Wise Men brought it up started it I suppose with the idea of  bringing gifts like And you know I think the most important part living in a rural area anyway 's of giving gifts is I presume it 's not the the value of the gift or the size of the gift It 's just that people are remembered I know some people say oh yeah you give a present to someone at Christmas and that kind of salves your conscience and you don't see them again for twelve months like But I mean right that that could be the case but at least this season the twelve days of Christmas and several days before it are times when people have probably have a chance despite all the hustle and bustle they have a chance to reflect on people you know it 's not someone there now you know someone that I know that maybe I haven't met lately or that I haven't maybe they would just welcome a chat or a small gift or a card and obviously that 's in essence, that is the spirit of Christmas not the the value of some huge big consumer item that might be necessary not or might not be necessary The smallest gift, and I 've often seen that myself, the smallest gift even if 'twas only a card or a letter can be as important to people as as some present worth maybe twenty or thirty pounds you know Just the the very thought of giving something and that the person is remembered", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9f480790-ea55-4f5f-99e3-eb69cdb1a9af", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.272398+00:00"}
{"text": "<Clerical Habits>\n\n\n\n<$A> Today on Clerical Habits I 've come to Corglass Manse outside Bailieborough in County Cavan, to the home of the Reverend Florence Taylor, Minister of First Bailieborough Coroneary, and Trinity Presbyterian Churches Florence 's hobby, is keeping horses\n\n<$B> Well we 're going up now to the stable yard It was built for me here in part of the old barn And I 'm going to bring my mare in from the field She 's out at grass having a little bit of a holiday at the moment I 'll bring you into the stable  introduce her to you\n<$A> How many horses do you and your son David have\n<$B> We have this young mare, a brood mare, an old ex-racehorse and a couple of young stock, three year old and a yearling\n<$A> So then it it is very much a family interest\n<$B> Oh very much a family interest, yes Now this is the stable, a lovely spacious stable\n<$A> Right   so  so very much uh purpose-built for   you \n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B>  Mhm   very much so in one end you see I 've the barn\n<$A> How long have you had the interest\n<$B> Oh since I was a very young child, about I suppose four or five my first, interest in horses   developed \n<$A>  Starting   off with a pony I suppose\n<$B> No I didn't have a pony of my own No I didn't\n<$A> No pony\n<$B> No pony of my own\n<$A> I thought most small girls that 's what, what they wanted\n<$B>  Well you know I used to pray for a pony, every night for years I finished my prayers by praying for a pony, but the pony never came We weren't a very well-off family so I 'm afraid a pony 's worth, it 'd beyond our means so I just rode on other people 's when I got the chance\n<$A> Were you self-taught or\n<$B> No no oh no no I wasn't No I at the beginning I rode on other people 's but, eventually then I was trained I was trained by Captain Jeremy Beale who was a member of the British Olympic Team, for a couple of years I went to him and then I went to Miss Iris Kellett in Dublin for many years, and in Kill in County Kildare\n<$A> So once it was in the blood it stayed there\n<$B> It certainly did\n<$A> Well let 's go and get this mare   or rather  I 'll let you   go and get the mare \n<$B>  Okay will you  \n<$B>  Yes I 'll go You   stay in because it 's raining You stay here and I 'll bring her down to you,  There we are Now\n<$A> Are you going to introduce us Florence\n<$B> Well this is Jenny, Padraig  Jenny meet Padraig   Shake a hoof \n<$A>  Hello Jenny  \n<$B> We 'll give you a little bit of carrot will we Here, chew that\n<$A> She doesn't seem to mind strangers\n<$B> No, no she doesn't She was racing this mare, before I got her she raced, did a few bumpers and a couple of hurdles, so she 's got accustomed to people and being out and about She 's a six year old little mare She 's a bay mare, fifteen two hands high so she 's not very big but big enough for jumping She 's  black mane and tail of course She 's by a Northern-based sire I think he 's dead now perhaps, Wren 's Hill, and out of a chasing-bred mare so she 's got a little bit of both flat and chasing blood in her, and she 's very promising as a show jumper I thought she might 've done dressage but she 's a bit hot for the dressage a bit excitable, but good for the show jumping I think\n<$A> Which of the disciplines do you prefer\n<$B> My late husband was a great horseman and we used to break, in young horses and show them You know so I love showing a horse, and I love dressage, but three-day eventing would be what we 're interested in mostly you know the dressage cross country and the show jumping\n<$A> Why is that Is it a combination of all those skills or\n<$B> I think so, yes I I 'm not  not really highly competitive at all you know I just enjoy working with them And uhm, well I wouldn't like you to think I didn't try my best I love things to be done well and properly but I 'm not going to worry if I don't win, as long as the horse goes well as long as I enjoy myself For me that 's the main thing\n<$A> What is it about being out there in the open on on horseback that that uh you find so, so enjoyable\n<$B> It 's hard to say Padraig really Uhm, I think with riding, it 's just being at one with your animal, you know having an understanding with an animal and getting the animal to do what you want it to do And it 's very exhilarating Racing for example going at high speed on a horse is very very exhilarating, very thrilling\n<$A> Now you 've spent a lot of your time down, around the Curragh which is\n<$B> That 's right\n<$A> One of the   I suppose  the most famous\n<$B>  Stop it Jenny  \n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Parts of the world for horses and racing\n<$B> Yes, it 's lovely in Kildare My husband uh was  running a stud there for Paddy Prendergast the late Paddy Prendergast, and I used to ride out for for four years I rode out on the race horses, and that really was it was really enjoyable both the breeding the the foals coming every spring and, the you know the young animals working with them and then of course the th' actual riding I found it very thrilling\n<$A> So at that stage you were a wife a mother of two children\n<$B> And a teacher \n<$A> And a teacher, and what was it then that was, within you do you think that was calling you towards the church or was that something that at that stage didn't make itself   evident \n<$B>  No no   that was quite dormant at that stage, totally dormant I mean of course we were churchgoers and church supporters and so on but, entering the church had never, entered my mind, at that stage\n<$A> Well Florence uh life took a dramatic turn for you, in nineteen eighty-five when when your husband was killed,   very suddenly \n<$B>  That 's right   yes that 's right, uhm it did Frank was killed in an accident He was driving home from work one evening and he met an empty turf lorry And you know how if they 're bringing a very large load of turf, they usually increase the the amount they can take by putting great big wooden gates on the top with  steel or iron supports, so those hadn't been properly secured, and unfortunately as his car met the lorry one of these fell on top of his car So that was certainly very unexpected and you know quite a shock Took me quite a while to get over that\n<$A> So there you were, unexpectantly,   widowed  and two children to   take care of \n<$B>  Mhm yes that 's right  \n<$B>  Uh-huh that 's right   Well they were, pretty well grown up at that time David was in his final year at the Veterinary College so,  a bit worried at that time in case it might uh cause him to fail his final exams but fortunately it didn't He got through Sheena of course she was in the working in the Northern Bank at that time She 'd just entered the Northern Bank so, they were both really pretty well advanced as regards both education and age\n<$A> How did you set about picking up the pieces\n<$B> Well it took some time It took quite a few months actually But then as I say I just decided that I would go back to college I 'd always wanted to, was never able to because of well family commitments and finance and so on or lack of finance I should say, and uhm I just decided this was the chance I would go back to university And I was actually late with my applications of course by the time I, picked myself up and decide to do this but I just managed to get in to be accepted\n<$A> And what had you thought to do\n<$B> Oh yes well I 'd thought of doing either French or music And as I say I just don't know why I ended up doing theology but I did I don't think anybody suggested it to me I presume it was just, God 's prompting if you like but I ended up doing theology, and enjoyed it\n<$A> And then when did you think well maybe I should see if I can put myself forward and become, more actively involved in the church\n<$B> Well I acted as a summer assistant for two summers in Ballybay in County Monaghan Second Ballybay Church where there was a vacancy And uhm I enjoyed doing that But again although I was doing that for those summers I still was not thinking of doing it as a full-time, occupation as I until my final year and then people said, you don't want to waste all you 've learned you want to put into practice would you not maybe think of the church And then I thought right I 'll I 'll apply and if I 'm accepted, well and good And that 's just how I did it\n<$A> So then what was the the next stage in your career\n<$B> Well uhm I applied then, uh for the interview the weekend the residential interview as we call it, and I was  accepted for that and went on ahead did my various interviews and eventually was accepted and that meant I had to do a pastoral year there at the college at the same time working as an assistant in a church in a congregation\n<$A> As you were thinking about the church and what might happen you must 've also had to bear in mind that uh you know you had, two children, who were growing   up  but also you had uh, your horses and you had your other outside interests and how you were going to blend all of those\n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B> That was difficult, very difficult I remember at one of my interviews, one of the interviewers suggesting that perhaps I might give up, my horses And so well I sort of  I just said him I said well have you given up your hobby He was a very keen golfer actually which of course he hadn't So I  I just said well I I certainly wouldn't dream of giving up either my horses or my dogs They 're part of my life so, it made it made more difficult, definitely more difficult because you can't just move around the country with a couple of horses and three or four dogs very easily\n<$A> How long have you been here in Bailieborough now\n<$B> Just three months, exactly three months Stop it Jenny\n<$A> This horse   I think it 's hungry \n<$B>  It could chew my coat yes   \n<$A> I think she 's she 's uh   telling us something \n<$B>  And her just off the grass yes   I don't know what it is \n<$A> So it 's I suppose it 's ideal for you   here is it \n<$B>  It is   Yes it is and it 's very near my own home you see which is eleven miles away Yes it 's lovely here\n<$A> Tell us something about the parish here\n<$B> Well in Bailieborough we have three churches, one just in the town and two in the country The Manse of course is also in the country, and I 've got about a hundred and thirty families to look after Quite a number of elderly folk but also, quite a number of young folk children and young married people This mare is   determined determined to  eat me isn't she or eat my coat Yes quite a number of young people and children coming on so it 's very promising, for the future I think We 've a big horse show here in Bailieborough in July and, quite a number of people roundabout interested in show jumping as such and horses, and very good relations with other you know churches in the community which is marvellous too, very very good relationships\n<$A>  This horse is, is hungry", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1e7ae0ff-a24d-4cc9-9b94-fed5aa420c3a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.273371+00:00"}
{"text": "<Sunday Sequence 1>\n\n\n\n<$A> Good morning and welcome to Sunday Sequence with me Patrick Speight  In the wake of the publication of the Opsahl Commission report we hear a response from the Churches We ask leading churchmen to assess the role of their own denominations And as the new Moderator of the Presbyterian Church calls for a return to basic Christian values, we hear the concerns of some women ministers within that church who fear a theological swing to the right  Also on the programme we join pilgrims going to the island of Inishmacsaint in County Fermanagh Morning service at half past ten comes from Gilnahirk Presbyterian Church in Belfast  Back to basics, that 's the theme the incoming Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Reverend Dr Andrew Rodgers has chosen for his year in office Last Monday evening Dr Rodgers was installed at a service at Church House in Belfast where he succeeded the Very Reverend Dr John Dunlop During his term of office the new Moderator intends to lead a personal crusade, to make the Christian message more apparent in society here And that was the main area of discussion when I spoke to the Moderator at Church House during last week 's General Assembly First though did he feel that a useful asset for any moderator at general assembly was a sense of humour\n<$B> Well have I found often Patrick that, whenever a situation gets a little bit tight whether in session committee or any other  meeting that if you can inject a little humour, without going too far I think it very often eases the situation and some things that people 're getting uptight about they ease off and perhaps it does help to to to bring a a a satisfactory conclusion to the whole matter I 've been I suppose blessed with a warped sense of humour or cursed with it whatever way you like to put it, that leaves me that I 've got to be a little bit careful in case I don't say too much too soon\n<$A> And yet you 've got a wonderful sense of humour, but some people might say that uh you know the uh, the principles upon which you are uh basing your   theme , of office this year lack humour because it 's back to moral censorship,\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> No it 's not back to moral censorship It 's back to, moral programme as God lays it out for us I don't want to be seen to be censoring people God leaves out for us clear rules for good wholesome living, and I 'm trying to point the Church and the people that they will I hope uh in some way or other influence back to the basic principles of good wholesome living, not a a a censorious business at all but rather here 's the right way to live God made us, he redeemed us by his son and here 's the way to live That 's what he 's saying and that 's what I 'm trying to point them back to\n<$A> But do you think people are going to listen to you\n<$B> I sincerely hope they do We 've been saying this again and again but not nearly often enough not nearly clearly enough maybe not nearly, specifically enough\n<$A> Is that because people see the Church, as a club, a social club\n<$B> I 'm afraid to say that many cases they do And that 's just a sad business if they do because it 's not It 's the gathering of God 's people together and it 's a matter of them going out with the message that they 've been given to tell others how to live in a way that is pleasing to God and that as the result of it being pleasing to God will be wholesome and happy for them\n<$A> Do you feel that perhaps some of the language that you used, might have been seen as perhaps a little insensitive I 'm thinking about your reference to gay and saying that that was an inept euphemism It 's a way they like to describe themselves They would consider homosexual to be too clinical perhaps derogatory\n<$B> Well I think that homosexual has overtones that are uh as you have mentioned that may be unhappy My problem with the word gay is that I always associated in the past gay with a a happy note, a a pleasant note For and this to attach that word to what is after all something that a tendency that they 've been born with which is not happy, to me is very sad Now I want to make it very clear that I did not condemn homosexuals Not at all I said quite simply that the Bible teaches that homosexuality is wrong in the sight of God And that we as a church and this is what I was trying to do, we as a church must get alongside those who have this tendency as we must get alongside those who are  uh have the tendency to alcoholism and get alongside them and try to help them to resist a tendency that they 've been born with or that they have eventually found within themselves and fight that tendency The tendency itself is not sin\n<$A> But how can you manage to do that successfully when you 've already criticised your own Church in a sense for being more like a social club I mean you would like to see uh a kind of moral regeneration   taking  place within the Presbyterian community and of  I suppose other communities as well but where would you locate what you see as the moral decay What has brought it about\n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B> Well I think isn't it really so that it 's because of a turning away from God and the right ways of living Righteousness says the Bible, exalteth a nation but sin, is a disgrace to any people And the people have turned from God and from righteousness and we are trying to call them back to the right way of living\n<$A> But you see people who perhaps, commit these   sins  alcoholism or shoplifting which you say should   be called theft  They 're already the marginalised They feel that, perhaps they haven't turned away from God but society has turned away from them It 's deprived them of employment It 's deprived them of good housing, and, they might get the feeling that you are admonishing them without really taking into consideration the real reasons behind perhaps,   shoplifting  If you 've got a if you 're a mother and you 're single parent, and you you haven't got enough money well then of course you 've got to feed your child You might go in to Woolworth 's and lift something\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yes yes  \n<$B>  Well if if  \n<$B> Yes I take your point that we 've got to recognise why they do this And we 've got to come alongside them and try to help them And that 's why I 'm very happy that in this year I will have the opportunity to work with the other Churches and to work closely with them, in for there are many areas that we can share together There 's this area of unemployment that you 've just mentioned and we are interested in doing all we can at every area in every place for that uh particular problem And one of the things that we noticed particularly is for example in the Shankill Road Mission we 're employing a hundred and seventy <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> workers, and in Carlisle House we 're doing some more of that same sort of thing We 're interested in unemployment and we can do it far better together, as the different Churches coming together in these sort of things We 're we 're uniting in education We 're uniting in the moral issues I 've a great deal in common with the Roman Catholic Church in their attitude <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> all such uh moral issues the the whole business of the   sanctity of life and the and and family values,   and law and order \n<$A>       yes of course but in relation to naming the sin\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Do you not feel that perhaps you put too much emphasis, on those sins and I put it in inverted commas committed, by people who are marginalised For example theft is is a poor person 's sin as it were What about   the rich What about the rich  people 's sin You know  insider dealing corruption in high places\n<$B>  Not always just not, ah but  \n<$B> Not not not always at all by it it it it the the it 's the poor person 's sin Very very often sure in high places I I I quoted where they 're they 're robbing the hospitals at a huge rate and the and at high levels we 're getting huge amounts of money being embezzled in every area It 's right across the board It 's not uh confined to the poor people You can understand the reason for the poor people doing it because they are so poor but in the case of the rich sin 's still sin and there 's still rich, uh going for theft and all the other things I know of some person uh not so very long ago uh connected with us indirectly who is very well off, and who was absolutely up to the eyes in making money through what is nothing short of theft\n<$A> Moderator I wonder if I could ask you, to reflect on this You come from the country You come from Dungannon\n<$B> That 's right Tyrone among the bushes\n<$A> Tyrone among the bushes\n<$B> How about that \n<$A> Is there a different in approach to moral values family values, between people who live in the rural areas of Ireland and those who live in the urban centres\n<$B> Yes I think you 've touched on a point that 's very valuable When people live on a farm for example, all the children are expected to gather together and help out on the farm They don't get paid for doing that It 's just part and parcel of living They get to know that there is required of them co-operation and concern and they live together in a family bunch Also they see different things happening on a farm animals being born and so forth and they get a a a interest into and a and a an insight into, uh, sex to be quite blunt, through just living on the farm and seeing the animals and so forth being born And there 's a wholesomeness of attitude to nature and to sex and to all that sort of thing and the family unit And very very often in the country you still find uh the vestiges of family worship and family discipline, and indeed family fun They go off for the day together as a family And of course in the old country churches the family pew and family grace before meals comes in There 's a lot to be said for being brought up in the country There 's a a solidity and a depth of of uh goodwill that 's found there that I don't think the town dweller and the city dweller particularly uh have the benefit of\n<$A> Moderator thank-you for joining us on Sunday Sequence\n<$B> And thank-you for having me\n<$C> The new Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland Dr Andrew Rodgers And there 'll be more from the General Assembly later in the programme  Last Wednesday morning the media crowded into the launch of a citizen s' enquiry, the Opsahl Commission 's Report on Northern Ireland The result of over five hundred and fifty submissions from various church and secular groups, whose main concern was to find a solution to the Troubles in Northern Ireland From the start of its deliberation the Opsahl Commission had a difficult task MP Ken Maginnis dismissed it The Northern Catholic Bishops failed to make a contribution, and some Republican community activists were suspicious of making a submission for fear of being politically vetted Apart from the SDLP who preferred to study the documents before giving a considered opinion, the other parties were clear about how they felt", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "32311890-0d4f-4c5d-ab16-fcd96b8fb4b2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.274273+00:00"}
{"text": "<Sunday Sequence 2>\n\n\n<$A> Their story begins in Northern Ireland as the elect people What does that do when it comes to looking at memory and how memory is used in telling a story\n<$B> Yes ah yes Well I I think it is that the the story uh has become the story which justifies a position of domination, and that 's its purpose I you see I don't think it 's necessarily very important what story groups of people tell, it 's the use to which they put the story And the uh use to which the story has been put in the North of Ireland is to justify a position of dominance Now I think there is also a what I called a Catholic Nationalist story, which uhm in the course of time came to serve a similar purpose Uh as you say we we 've got the big battalions therefore we have the right to call the tune And my purpose in writing the book was to show that what we have to do with in Ireland is two mutually incompatible and mutually exclusive ideologies, what I 've called the Catholic Nationalist one and the Protestant Unionist one Though I 'm perfectly aware of the fact that there are people who don't fit strictly speaking into that group but I 've called them those And that it is really uhm a mistake on the part of liberally-minded people to say, let 's ask these two to settle down together and live comfortably together and respect one another They were constructed precisely in order not to live with one another and they were constructed precisely in order to have one group dominate over another Now uh what I have suggested in the book is that you have to try and transcend, these two It 's not a question of giving them uh equal respect, as is often said by well-meaning people, but rather to try and transcend these two uh mutually exclusive ideologies\n<$A> But that must be an extremely difficult thing to do I mean to transcend means that you might have to debunk some of the mythology that has grown up around, the Catholic story and the Protestant story And you talk about prophetic voice Do you have a prophetic way in which the Churches could actually do that\n<$B> Yeah I I I I 'm not saying that I do but uh I think that uh we 're given some pointer to what could happen from the fact that uhm both these ideologies if we may call them that, uhm are behaving as though they had a plan for the future but in fact neither of them does Now you can say uh it 's uh not popular these days to talk about uh ideologies as as having any good features, but a good ideology will have a uh will have some idea of a future goal to which we are aiming Now we know of course how dangerous   light uh after the collapse of Stalinism, uhm we know how dangerous it is when ideologies say there is an end in view there is a great future and you must be sacrificed uh to this We know how dangerous that is But at the same time what we have in Ireland or have had in Ireland I think of recent generations is uh two uh ideologies which are pretending to a future end that they don't actually believe in any more There 's no future uh in attempting to go back to pre nineteen sixty-seven which is broadly speaking all that Ulster Unionism has to offer, uh nor is there a future in Catholic Nationalism And I I think that the establishment in Dublin has been too lazy to think of what the future might be, for us all together, uh but has simply continued to mouth, ideals uhm that were fought for and that were hammered out uh by people of an earlier generation but which won't do it for us\n<$A> But the two protagonists to the conflict might disagree with you uh seriously For example if you walked through the areas of uh uh Loyalist Belfast you 'll see that men will take up the gun to fight for God and Ulster They 'll say that 's our vision We want, to to maintain the link with Britain and we want to maintain our Protestant ethos We want, to regenerate that ethos with each new generation\n<$B> Yeah but I mean I think insofar as that is clearly thought about today it  it 's an exclusive rather than an inclusive vision And uhm I think uh this is also true of the any vision that is left in uh Catholic Nationalism that it 's exclusive rather than inclusive\n<$A> But has Catholic Nationalism any part to play for example in the struggle that is taking place in Northern Ireland today I mean what, uh what kind of primacy do uh the IRA the Provisional Sinn Fe/in give to Catholic Nationalism when they have their vision of a united Ireland\n<$B> Well this is is of course a very good question because I think what we 're seeing at the moment is a division isn't it I think that  that the Catholic Church, faced with the fact that it is losing ground, uhm is I would say reprehensibly accepting patronage uh from government sources And there is a strong anti-clericalism Uh they 're being used in other words to shore up inside the Catholic community uh opposition to the IRA Now inside the IRA there is quite understandably a strong anti-clerical feeling Now uhm I think that uhm, the the Catholic Nationalism represented by the official Church organs in say let us say West Belfast has no particular vision for the future Uh I 'm not sure however that the IRA does either because I think the uh IRA and the INLA and uh uh such groups are, fundamentally at fault because they they are behaving as though the enemy uhm of us all is the British Empire Now the British Empire has disappeared I think there are great forces that uhm are undermining the possibility of the future for all our children, in this island But I 'm quite sure that it is not the British Empire And uh in the same way uh I 'm quite sure that the kind of, civil and religious liberties that Protestantism has stood for, uh are not particularly well defended by a Protestant monarch sitting in uh Buckingham Palace, but are preserved by forces that really don't have very much to do with whether you 've a king or a or don't have a king\n<$A> So are you actually saying uh in a sense that uh the stories, the two stories one Protestant the other Catholic Nationalist one Protestant Loyalist, they 're actually crumbling They 're crumbling now in front of a world which is changing rapidly and the ideologues of both camps aren't prepared to accept that\n<$B> Yeah I think that 's I think that 's true And uh but of course I think that uh it is important uhm when people are living side by side that they listen to the story of the other group, or they listen to their own story uh as it is told by the other group because it makes a uh just an enormous difference whether a story is told by a dominating group or by dominated group So uhm one might think about nineteen sixteen let us say, uh in a uh Dublin uh suburb in the middle class and have a rather uh critical view of it and so on and uh attempt to assess it and uh uh that 's fine But it 's a very different thing to talk about nineteen sixteen in a beleaguered street in West Belfast In the same way men may talk about the  the women 's case in a way that is uh very cool and so on But we speak as the dominating sex It 's a very different thing to talk that uh uh talk about the same matters uh as a woman And it is important however always for the dominating group to listen uh ever more clearly to and ever more attentively to the dominated people Now, it 's not always going to be a a nice experience to do so And you 're going if you belong to a dominating group you are going constantly as you hear the other speaking to say but that 's not quite fair it wasn't really quite like that and it isn't quite like that But you can't do it You must listen Because uh it 's not necessarily going to be a beautiful thing what they say and it 's not  always going to be fair but it 's got to be heard And as we do listen to one another 's story that way there is a chance, down the road, that by the articulating of their story as they see it, that the dominated people uhm will begin to be released from some of the hurt that they are feeling And if we won't listen to them now to the dominating group, they won't get through that stage\n<$A> I 'm just wondering whether that paradigm is functional today in Northern Ireland because, in a sense the dominant group I 'm talking about Unionists, are no longer dominant in any real sense because they don't have any  uh they don't have any control over, political power It 's it 's direct rule from Westminster They feel that there is a a democratic deficit They are in the process of creating a new story A new story which evolves around, look we 're victims too\n<$B> Yes yes I I I actually tried to talk about that in in this book right that it it must be taken uh uh on board by people particularly the establishment let us say in Dublin, uh that the Unionist people, are a group of people whose usefulness to their masters if we may put it like that without offensiveness is over And it is after all the duty of garrison people as they have  by and large been, that they should not win friends and influence people because you 've got to dominate people and if you 're going to dominate them then you don't try to win them over as friends Now their usefulness, in terms of the old imperial structures, is over That 's finished That story is finished They are therefore feeling themselves uh abandoned and out on a limb Now this is the opportunity it seems to me for people, on this side of the border to be magnanimous, and to recognise that and to recognise that sense of isolation and abandonment that I detect very strongly, uh among uh Northern Protestant people at the moment So I take your point entirely\n<$A> And that book by Terence McCaughey Memory and Redemption is published by Gill and Macmillan price twelve pounds ninety-nine As we pointed out at the beginning of the programme the Methodist Conference is currently meeting in Dublin One of the issues discussed on Friday concerned the role of Methodist societies in the local community The conference would like to challenge Methodists throughout Northern Ireland to rediscover their identity as a community church When I spoke to the Reverend David Cooper, Secretary of the Methodist Council on Social Welfare I asked him to explain what that challenge involved\n<$C> One of the challenges that that brings to us as Methodists is how do we serve these communities And uh one of the reports before us this year is to seek to help Methodist churches not to be an end in themselves but to be a means to an end in the sense that we want our Methodist churches to serve the community\n<$A> Now you said how we can serve these communities the plural Are you suggesting that you have to serve other Protestant communities in these segregated areas of Northern Ireland\n<$C> Well I I think we have to recognise the fact that there is an increasing number of people within Protestantism who are alienated from the Church", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL",

{"text": "<Bishop Poyntz>\n\n\n<$A> Samuel Poyntz Church of Ireland Bishop of Connor told his Diocesan Synod in Belfast this morning, he 's a disappointed man He attempted to set up a body to help Protestant areas uh come up with schemes to seek financial aid from various funds, for example the International Fund Only a handful, of professional people were prepared to help Uh the Bishop told his diocese, we have much to learn from the Roman Catholic Church He also hit out at intolerance, racketeering, the staking out of territory through pavement painting and gable wall murals He praised cross-community ventures Obscenity, pornography, nudity, bad language, violence all incurred the wrath of the Bishop So too alienation, not just of the orange green variety, the gap between the haves and the have-nots Bishop Poyntz when I talked to him this morning didn't draw back from criticism of the Protestant professional classes for their indifference when asked to help the disadvantaged\n<$B> I 've always felt that there 's a lack of cohesiveness about the Protestant communities in Belfast Uh the one of the great differences between the Falls Road and the Shankill Road is that the Falls Road is uh has a great community area I think bound together not probably politically but religiously whereas if you go to other areas like the Shankill or other areas there 's a a we 've got that sort of Protestant individualism And uhm I I, I I see enormous strides being made in other areas, tremendous funds being poured into other areas and quite rightly so too And it seemed to me that perhaps we weren't getting our act together And that we should look for uhm uh expertise people like maybe solicitors and bankers and trade unionists and community workers and retired civil servants other people like that who might be help help us and help clergy and parishes uh in formulating schemes and Yeah I 'm afraid I my my appeal didn't meet with any great uh response Perhaps uh it 's just uh that we are indifferent or perhaps it 's the difficulty getting people to own an idea Maybe I didn't sell it properly\n<$A> How how many replies did you get from professionals\n<$B>  Unfortunately I only had three\n<$A> Only three\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Now perhaps uh the feeling is or the perception is that Protestant areas generally are or have been better served both in employment and and facilities Maybe that 's the reason\n<$B> Well if that 's the the people are completely out of touch I mean uh the the the unemployment in I in in in our ghetto areas is just as bad as in Belfast as any other area I would say And it doesn't make any difference whether you 're on the Shankill Road or the Falls Road, uh I I uh or you you 'll find an enormous uh amount of unemployment\n<$A> Now you you mentioned this uh Roman Catholic community and the,   cohesion  and and the efforts to obtain you mentioned grants going to places like Poleglass the New Lodge I think North Howard Street something in the region of fifteen million pounds And uh  you 've been saying that you admire their   success  I mean I I I am sure and I accept it is admire and not covet\n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B>  Yup  \n<$B> Oh no I it 's it 's quite admire I feel that they have got their their their act together And uh look at the scheme in Poleglass valued at five point one million  it it it obviously has  uh involved a lot of people who have got the project right and have thought it out and prepared the whole ground well I 'm quite certain money is there at the government level but you must get your act together\n<$A> Yes but but your comments about Protestant disadvantage and the need for uh support both financial and skilled echo the views of uh a man I interviewed the other day former UDA man Glen Barr You were were at one   with his views on this one \n<$B>  Yes, yes   indeed I would be Indeed I would be And I I believe that there 's tremendous goodwill out there There I I believe I 'm sure there 's goodwill in the government I 'm sure there 's goodwill in in forms like the  the the Ireland Fund Uh all sorts of other  funds have got to be tapped And I 'm I was delighted uh on to see on on yesterday 's paper that uhm there 's another uh substantial sum of money being pumped into making Belfast work Already a hundred and twenty-four million has been pumped in uhm to to various areas and I 'm delighted that but we must sort of think things through and and and have come up with viable projects well thought out and above all the people who are going to put it right through to the see it through to the end\n<$A> Uh  there 's a psychology in this one Bishop perhaps that has to be looked at and and and it is this May I put this point to you that uh Protestants perhaps fear, uh that to advance along these lines is to challenge authority and that in some way would diminish loyalty uh to the State and to the Crown You see it 's all about a statement of nationality and religion and belonging And some things are said to me in the course of this programme when we talk about grants and disadvantage, if only the other lot knew what side their bread was buttered on they wouldn't be doing this they wouldn't be taking all this money from the State and the Crown, You must be aware of that stream of thinking\n<$B> There is a sore sense of pride that you don't admit I 'm quite certain that large numbers of people uh when when they  they had appalling housing on the Shankill Road never admitted that they were in appalling housing twenty and twenty-five years ago But suddenly as a result of a whole lot of things happening in the outside world they began to see that their lot was just as bad as other people 's lots and so forth And uhm, I think that we 're now sort of uh uh in we now in a situation where there 's all sorts of alienation We so often talk about the alienation of the uh Roman Catholic or Nationalist community with Britain but there 's even an alienation now I think between  between Loyalists and Unionists from Britain an an alienation even between the haves and the have-nots And I think that so often uh in in the Protestant areas especially you find that the the poverty lies behind swathes of area of considerable affluence And we must be we must be aware of this and we must try and bring uhm a cohesion of the situation whereby something is done to ameliorate this situation\n<$A> Now let me ask you uh uh briefly about some other aspects of of your address and, uh the moral crusade if I may so describe it You you uh deliver an attack on obscenity, nudity, pornography, lack of privacy but don't, these uh don't those things pale set beside the obscenity of murder, violence, intolerance, bigotry and hate The real villains of the piece in this community\n<$B> Well of course obscenity  where does obscenity flourish most It flourishes in the areas of sexuality, of cruelty and violence The whole three are connected up together And indeed uh uh uh very often it is sometimes, uh racketeering and paramilitary racketeering that uh cashes in on the shortcomings of other people And we have heard of that uh of of them uh pirating uh videos and things like that to sell for their for their own ill-gotten gain and so forth And uhm I I think that uhm, that that really there 's only a a a a thin paper wall between those three areas of sexuality cruelty and violence\n<$A> So you you think that there there has to be a reconstruction as it were of moral values in the community\n<$B> No I think the moral values are there but the facts are that  uhm uh so much has been happening in the community uhm through things like uhm uhm much more of uhm uh use of video and and film and so forth, uh and the cashing in on obscenity I think that uh the film industry for years was in in some decline and now has uh through through the use of way-out producers have now begun to uhm uh produce, uhm films uh which have been condemned by a large circle of people I mean Lord Rees-Mogg recently uhm sounded criticism of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's uh Terminator films And so many other films too seem to highlight violence I mean you 've only got to go to Silence of the Lambs and so forth And people are beginning to I think see that the whole swing of the pendulum has gone far too far, and that that it begets violence\n<$A> Yes I I just been uh  glancing through uh your uh address Homosexuality I don't think is mentioned is it\n<$B> Well I there 's a limit to what you can mention \n<$A> No it 's just that the Moderator touched   on it  recently and said this this is a sin do not call it by any   other  name Would you feel the same\n<$B>  Yeah well I  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> No I think that I wouldn't ah I think that certainly it can be called sin certainly but there 's also a question that people are are are uh find themselves with these genes in their bodies and so forth and they 've got to learn to live with it It 's only when it 's uh it 's only when it is uhm used wrongly People cannot alter their genes They can't alter their balance and so forth I wouldn't want to go down that road too far but that wasn't, that wasn't the area which I was  dealing with in my address\n<$A> You you talk about the portrayal of uhm somewhere you mention the portrayal of the the sexual act either on   stage  or or or on films\n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B> Yes privacy I think today is under threat  from all sorts of angles whether you think in terms of bugging devices and uh and uh many other ways and so forth, Is there not an inner sanctuary in a person 's life or in a married couple 's life which ought not to be public property And I think that there 's nothing wrong with uh as I tried to say this morning there 's nothing wrong in in nudity at all Nobody 's ever saying anything there 's anything wrong with that I mean you can look at many ancient uhm, uhm statues in in in Egypt You can look at many Middle Ages paintings and so forth which focus on human sexuality which can be beautiful and thought to be in good taste I think that sometimes we Christian people can damage our cause not a little by uh over-reacting to all that nudity thing The body human body is God-given God-made It is beautiful but what makes it pornographic is when someone presents it to be nastily suggestive and alluring And I think that is one of the the great problems is that, people today are stoking the flames of lust uh and sort of giving the impression to get and not to give\n<$A> Yeah I 'm just wondering cos my last point is I wonder why, uh say a nude statue from ancient Greece would be considered beautiful and in good taste and perhaps a picture of an attractive young lady, in a newspaper would not Is it because we are wrapping it up in a sort of classic package that it seems okay\n<$B> Well I think there 's there there is a sort of uh there can be I think an abuse of women to a titillation of of uh making them the object of uhm, the use of men and so forth I think that uhm, you can uh exploit and dehumanise sex you know\n<$A> Well that was Bishop Poyntz and uh it 's his Diocesan, uh Meeting today and he spoke to me uh a little before that Quite a number of issues there for you to think about", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9133a189-20a0-41cf-ac42-d5c41c2f8f3c", "added":

{"text": "<Sam McAughtry>\n\n\n<$A> Well now uh to return to the house for a moment uhm, presumably uh you had gas lighting, uh in the house at that time\n<$B> We had gas lighting Uh I suppose I would put it about nineteen thirty-four, when electrification began Until then we had gas lighting with mantles everywhere and sometimes no mantle If the mantle broke you just let the the gas, gutter away there the raw flame\n<$A> And what about cooking Was cooking done   by gas \n<$B>  Gas  , gas cooker There were there were little, uh additions, uh for for this came in I would think about nineteen thirty thirty-one Those men who worked in or about the shipyard, uh they were nearly all labourers in the district where I was born and brought up We didn't have tradesmen in the shipyard but quite a few worked as labourers in the shipyard And they would get tradesmen to make little contraptions, uh, a sort of a cross a metal cross with holes drilled into them, which were fitted on to the gas pipe And uh, you lit the gas came through these little holes and you lit them and you had this little burning cross and on top of that you laid your griddle, which was the first gas griddles Before that, the griddle was used just on the bare flames on the hob And uh, then on the griddle of course you baked your soda bread and potato bread and you baked your tarts and stuff like this you know and uh, that was that was the sort of uhm, cooking and baking and lighting that we had up until about nineteen thirty-four thirty-five when electrification came in\n<$A> Well now what about heating in the house\n<$B> Heating in the house just came from the one fire There was no heating apart from the fire Uh there were in uh a hot water bottle in bed was the ordinary stone hot water bottle or a hot brick wrapped in a an old cloth socks You wore, uh very heavy bedclothes Overcoats on the beds was quite commonplace We believed in those days that uh weight, was the whole thing and the heavier your bedclothes the warmer you were but uh sleeping in socks wasn't out of the ordinary at all\n<$A> Well now would you say that the house was cold uncomfortable\n<$B> Uh most most uncomfortable I mean tempers were lost, around the fire The whole family huddled around the fire It it helped, uh the spirit of a family a good deal It brought us close together but it caused trouble too Because when the fire needed coal, it was a certainty that if uh my mother ordered me to go out and get a shovel of coal, and I had a good seat beside the fire when I came back with the shovel of coal somebody 'd pinched it And I 'd find myself furthest away from the fire sitting on the sofa or somewhere and this this is  all sorts of rows and arguments about this But that was the sole source of heat in the house Uh the upstairs fires were never lit except in sickness This was an indication of sickness  Pardon me Uh, a sure indication of sickness in the house was the bedroom fire lit\n<$A> Well now what about the general overall standard of the housing in in Cosgrave Street How would you describe Cosgrave Street in terms of other housing in Belfast at that time\n<$B> I would say it was uh just about, with the exception of an area around Millfield in Belfast, and uh one or two areas, which dated from the original old Belfast from the eighteen hundred thereabouts you know, even earlier than eighteen hundred, the housing in in north Belfast and in particular in the area where I lived it  known as Tiger Bay where I lived must 've been the lowest, uh quality housing in the city\n<$A> Uh would you describe the houses as being on the whole well-cared for Uh, when you looked at them when you looked at the street from the outside or when you went inside, would you say the houses were well-kept well-cared for\n<$B> In general no The the reason for this is that uh, I lived in a Protestant area and people always believe, that Protestants were neat and tidy in their habits And indeed near the shipyard, you would see houses to this day that were beautifully kept neat and tidy and cleaned and uh kept well-painted every twelfth of July There was a routine And to some extent in the area where I lived some repainting went on at the twelfth of July and we had a good many people in the street, who kept their houses neat and tidy but we had an awful lot more who didn't Uh this ties up with the fact that we were not very well off even by Protestant standards The streets around us when you left this little area where I lived, you and you were still in Protestant territory but when you went to Adam 's Street, Hogarth Street, Merview Street and the streets closer to Duncairn Gardens from where we were, you were in an area where where shipyard tradesmen were were quite common every seventh or eighth house And uh this  this was reflected on more uh the people knew  they had more money and they knew where it was coming from It wasn't much more but it was enough to make that difference And it it, the people in those houses outside our area kept their houses nice and neat and clean and it had the look of it But in our area because we weren't all that privileged and because there wasn't work for us, our menfolk tended to be away from home They worked across the water or they were seafaring like my father and my brother And with the men out of the house whether that was the reason for the loss of interest in the house I don't know but, all up and down the streets where I lived, were houses that were not cared for at all\n<$A> Well what about uh the rents that uh you had to pay for for your house\n<$B> The rent of our house was four and tuppence a week\n<$A> And that would 've been common for the street\n<$B> Yeah that would 've been average Between four to six shillings I would 've thought\n<$A> Right and what what sort of people apart you mentioned uh seafaring people what other sort of people would 've been living in your street at that time\n<$B> All sorts of  We had a man  pardon me we had a man living opposite us who was a bailiff His job was to throw people out for non-payment of rent We 'd another man living opposite us who shovelled coal in the uh gasworks He was a labourer And uh one night he came back and everybody thought he was drunk and it was the effects of the gas There had been a gas leak in the gasworks on the Ormeau Road and uh, the his wife thought he 'd been drinking and uh he collapsed and very nearly died Another man we had was a tailor He he worked downtown, in a basement and he made uh clothes as a tailor Uh we had, men there who 'd never worked You know they just had got out of the habit of working They just spent their day, mooching around down in the the near near uh, the the shores of Belfast Lough They had these plots workmen 's plots, where you could grow things And these men seemed to spend half their time down there They didn't bother looking too much looking for work They would live off the proceeds of their son 's wages, and so on Sometimes the women worked part-time in the mills There was plenty of work for boys incidentally, because as a uh I was describing the the, great many shops, that were in existence Uh all the whole streets of Belfast not just the centre but radiating right the whole way out throughout the city were rows and rows of shops thousands of them, all in competition and these shops all employed message boys It was about a fifty-hour week for about five shillings The equivalent of twenty-five pence today And uh unlike nowadays when the housewife is expected to go to a shop or a supermarket, pack her own stuff in a basket, line up, and pay for it, on the way out, in those days they sent boys like us, to knock the customers ' doors, and say, I 'm from such and such a shop What would you like me to bring you And she would tell us the order We 'd go back to the shop pack it up in a basket and carry it out and deliver it to her So there was plenty of work for the likes of us And it was useful because, the the money that I would earn as a message boy paid the rent, which was uh quite a help in those days\n<$A> Well now as far as the interior of the house is concerned, did you have a wireless at that time in the house\n<$B> I can remember, I can remember the wirelesses coming They they 're old-fashioned uh, cats whiskers set, crystal set it was called Now that was the very first form of wireless that uh, reached the common people And there were very few of those One man on our street had one and it was a bit of a curiosity You had to listen to them with earphones And when the more popular radio came in, uh, it came in rather slowly in our district, but I would put that, at about nineteen thirty-two thirty-three I remember carrying the wet battery round to be recharged And I would 've been eleven or twelve That would 've made it nineteen thirty  two or thirty three Uh they were quite popular When hire purchase came in, uh in nineteen thirty-four thirty-five, and offers were made for half a crown down you can buy a  a a radio set, this is when the electrical radios or the the dry battery, was beginning to give way to the electric radio uh, they offered these sets at half a crown down and so much a week And lots of the people round our district got their husbands to sign for this half a crown deposit And paid a half a crown got the radio set and of course they couldn't keep up the payments  And the whole district was was aloud with noise You know the, they talk about the hills are alive with the sound of music well the streets were alive with these radios  And uh and they came around and took them all away from them again because they couldn't keep up their payments\n<$A> Well there wouldn't have been presumably any other kind of uh, electrical or other uh, labour-saving devices in the house at that time\n<$B> No\n<$A> In the kitchen for example what what was the kitchen like I mean could you describe it for us\n<$B> Well the kitchen there would be a table underneath the window and there was a sofa, on the wall opposite that The sofa was always drawn up beside the fire alongside the fire And uh there was always what we called a cabinet and became known later as a sideboard And that was as you entered the room always, as you entered the room from the hall Some of the houses had a longish hallway and others like ours had nothing It just had a little square hallway about five feet square And you, uh the the stairs ran right into the hallway, so that if you ran too fast down the stairs it just took one step and you were out into the street", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "52685c69-3b8c-4c8f-b91c-c2d6a5548307", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.277343+00:00"}
{"text": "<Elections>\n\n\n<$A> Victory has been sweet for the new rainbow ministers while Fianna Fa/il and the Progressive Democrats now form the opposition, But how long will that state of affairs continue, This morning we talked to PD leader Mary Harney, about the challenges facing the new government, I first asked her if her description of a bright red rainbow of ruin was a bit over the top,\n<$B> I don't believe it is I think if you look at the programme that has been negotiated between Fine Gael Democratic Left and the Labour Party, it 's very much the policy approach of Democratic Left and the Labour Party and I see very little evidence, of the Fine Gael philosophy of recent years, Uh if you just take the allocation of portfolios for example, uh Fine Gael now have control over just about twenty percent of the spending departments, Uh that 's very serious I believe Labour have control over the Department of Finance, Education and the Environment, Northern Ireland policy, they 've control over broadcasting, and they will be calling the shots in relation to the divorce referendum, I think, the makeup of the cabinet and the economic programme in particular indicate quite clearly to me that this is very much a left-wing government and it 's not the kind of government that the country needs at the moment, If you take the attitude to state enterprise, it 's the old left-wing doctrine that we have to accept, No privatisation,\n<$A> You 've worked closely with John Bruton in opposition, Do you not have faith in the man to be firm and decisive after your experience working with him on the opposition benches\n<$B> I had huge regard for John Bruton We worked very closely together, Uhm I was very disappointed with the way he handled the negotiations for the formation of government, despite the fact that Fine Gael had fifty percent more seats than the Labour Party the Labour Party seemed to call all the shots, Uh and that 's evident not just in the parties that make up the government but indeed in the very programme, and in the composition of the cabinet And as I said Fine Gael only have control over about one fifth of the spending, And that certainly doesn't indicate to me that Fine Gael is in government with fifty percent more seats than the Labour Party\n<$A> This is the first inter-party government for for forty years and we 're talking about personal  personal relationships being very very important How do you think Dick Spring and Prionsias De Rossa particularly will get on\n<$B> Well as we saw at the break of the last government  obviously the unexpected that can cause the biggest problems, And I think that may well be the case with this government too, I think it will, be a question of whether or not trust can be established between the three party leaders, I think Prionsias De Rossa and John Bruton have worked well in opposition, uh so I don't see that as a problem,   But I don't \n<$A>  Do you think they work better   better together than uh, than Dick Spring and John Bruton or Dick Spring and Prionsias De Rossa\n<$B> Certainly that would be my view yes, Uhm and I hope that that changes, Uhm if the three party leaders don't make an enormous effort to work together as a team the government will collapse Or it won't really exist because, to a large extent you can be doing a lot of very productive work, you can have a lot of progressive legislation, but if the trust is not there from the start, then the government won't survive Certainly uh we saw evidence of that in the, different governments led by Albert Reynolds Trust broke down and once it did everything else collapsed,   And my advice \n<$A>  Do you think this   government, this government can last for the duration of its three year period,\n<$B> It 's always possible It 's too early to say It could collapse very early on, The government has the potential to collapse within a matter of weeks\n<$A> Now you 've mentioned a couple of fault lines that could develop, What do you think will be the first one,   the one that could cause them to collapse in weeks \n<$B>  Well it could it could collapse in the   formation of the budget, Uhm I I anticipate that there 'll be enormous problems between say Prionsias De Rossa who 's in the Department of Social Welfare, who will want to make his mark there and that of his party, and Ruairi Quinn perhaps, Uhm it won't be even to do with financial matters it may well be to do with personality issues as well, Uhm I think there are a lot of difficulties down the road the whole state enterprise area, We have to because of our membership of EU, we have to be responsible, we have to have competitive state enterprises able to compete in the market, I think from the programme for government it 's clear the government don't understand that, and they seem to want to avoid dealing with that And because of the amount of fudge on  crucial issues, local charges, and I already see that there 's a campaign underway to get a clear commitment from the government to end them completely, that 's not on the programme for government There are many many things but as I said earlier, it 's often the unexpected the things you can't see now that may cause the problem\n<$A> One issue they 'll have to resolve quite quickly is the position of the European Commissioner and also the Leas Ceann Comhairle, What are your views on the decisions they have to take in these regard in this regard\n<$B> Well firstly in relation to the Leas Ceann Comhairle, I supported the nominee of Fine Gael in the last occasion because I think it 's important that the opposition has that position Until recent years the opposition always had that position, I think it would be wrong to remove  Joe Jacob for that reason but more importantly, he has been a very fair Leas Ceann Comhairle in my opinion He 's been very good in the chair, and he 's been very fair to all sides, And if somebody 's to be removed they should only be removed if they 're not doing the job and he certainly is doing the job and doesn't warrant, uhm being removed from that position And I hope that the government won't proceed with that And certainly, if they do they will not have the support of the Progressive Democrats, In relation to Padraig Flynn, the personality of the Commissioner is not the issue, I was very disappointed for example that Labour and Fianna Fa/il didn't support Peter Sutherland, earlier this year because if they did, he would 've been I think the President of the Commission at this stage And that would 've been a very prestigious position, for a small country like ours It 's no longer the case that we could get the presidency of the Commission, And therefore I believe that the new government if they 're going to change the Commissioner, at this very late stage, have to be sure, that it 's not going to damage the national interest Padraig Flynn has an extremely important portfolio, and the government would need to be certain, that they could hold that portfolio, if they were going to change the person, And I don't know if they could be certain of that and I think they need to be very careful It 's not a question of putting in our own, We have to look after the national interest That 's what must come first\n<$A> Do you feel hard done by, in the run-up to the formation of this government\n<$B> I wouldn't call it hard done by but I thought the experience certainly was an interesting one I, I 've said to people I learned more in the last two weeks than I 've perhaps possibly learnt in my previous seventeen years in Leinster House, I found the negotiations we had with Fianna Fa/il in nineteen eighty-nine, a lot more open and business like, I found these negotiations insofar as we were involved, uhm very unpleasant\n<$A> On another issue a very crucial issue of Northern Ireland do you fear that the consensus and unity that seemed to, to unite all politicians is starting to break down slightly given Albert Reynolds ' comments yesterday uh about cross-border institutions,\n<$B> Well I 've already said that those comments were, unwise and insensitive, And I repeat that I was very surprised, Albert Reynolds was one of the main architects of the Peace Process, He must be aware, of the need for, sensitivity, Albert Reynolds himself was very concerned just over a year ago when a very important document was leaked to a journalist And he expressed that concern The problem we have in Northern Ireland is that, we 've  two divided, communities a divided people, You only bring those people together if we are conscious, of their concerns, And if we fail uh to do that then I think we 're going to cause further problems Already we see the reaction among the Unionists They 're frightened about what 's going to happen, And I think it makes it more difficult for the two governments to be able to come forward with the realistic proposals that are necessary And we do need a North South dimension to any settlement It makes it more difficult, when fears have been raised by somebody like Albert Reynolds And I believe, the result of what he did yesterday is very damaging, I hope it 's not going to continue, And I certainly think it 's very unfair on the new government   In a period \n<$A>  Do you  , do you think it 's going to cause big problems for John Bruton if the architect of the process is standing behind at him shouting from the sidelines uh\n<$B> Albert Reynolds has the potential to destroy the process if he continues speaking like this, This is a period of uncertainty because we have a new government It 's a difficult process anyway It 's very fragile the Peace Process It requires great sensitivity on all our parts I 've given my assurance and that of the Progressive Democrats to the new government that we will support, what they do, And I hope that Fianna Fa/il do likewise,\n<$A> Well that was Progressive Democratic leader Mary Harney, We 'll be returning to the Peace Process a bit later on but joining me now live in studio is the Democratic Left Leader, and the new Minister for Social Welfare Prionsias de Rossa First of all, congratulations on your new appointment It 's uh it 's a high-spending department, How do you intend to make your mark,\n<$C> Well uhm I intend to make my uh mark by seeking to implement the programme which we have negotiated with the other parties in government Uhm we have managed in the course of those negotiations to, negotiate one of the most significant changes in our approach to assisting  uh families uh  ever ever ever achieved and that is in relation to child  benefit There will be a new uhm, increase in child   benefit but also the uh provision of a supplementary child benefit which will uh  replace the child dependence allowance for  social welfare recipients, and uh for low paid  workers the uh F FIS It will it will it will mean that a lot of people who, previously uhm would lose child support because they uh went from the social welfare system into work uh will no longer do so and it will eliminate a lot of uhm, poverty traps It it is a major step  forward\n<$A> Well Mary Harney would say your time the time you have to make your mark could be quite limited could be limited to a matter of weeks", "subdomain":

{"text": "<Kevin Moran>\n\n\n<$A> A household name in, in Ireland he starred with the Dubs in the seventy-six All-Ireland Final in their win over old rivals Kerry A couple of years later, sports fans here were very surprised to hear Kevin was joining Manchester United Many people feared it was a bit of a foolish mistake he hadn't even played in the League of Ireland, but sixteen years on and after massive success Kevin Moran 's still playing at the highest level and preparing to head for the USA with the Irish World Cup squad and today Kevin Moran is our guest in the studio Well are you ready for a grilling for an hour you are\n<$B> Looking forward to it Des\n<$A> The uh, the move to Manchester United were you worried that it might be a mistake at the time because you were, you were you were finished college weren't you and you\n<$B> I was yeah Uhm I think I was uh definitely apprehensive about going over but I just said to myself, I 've got to give it a try And I think that was the main reason why I went in the end In all honesty I don't think I thought I would make it But I always felt I wanted to have a good go at it Just play one game I always remember saying that to people All I just want to do is to play one game and get back home again because as far as I was concerned all I wanted to do was play with the Dubs\n<$A> Yeah And career-wise it was shaping up well for you then\n<$B> Exactly You know I just I was in Oliver Freeney at the time Do you know there was a good accountancy career ahead of me The Dubs were actually going so well at the time and I 'd no real interest You know I think when I was about seventeen years of age eighteen och that 's, that 's when I wanted to go away to Manchester United\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> But at twenty-two you think well you know your chance has gone more or less\n<$A> But you know when you go over for a trial I mean most fellas go for a trial at fifteen or sixteen or whatever Uhm what was it like going over at twenty-two\n<$B> Uhm I was a little bit bigger than all the others there \n<$A> Well were you treated the same as them\n<$B> I was I was treated the same as them Yeah and that And uhm\n<$A> That must have been strange\n<$B> Well the the thing about it is that when I went over for the trial they wanted me to go over in the initial part for two weeks and I said I couldn't do it So I said I 'll tell you what, you 've got two or three days And the good thing about two or three days is they can't see all your faults in two or three days  So that helped enormously and then after that Dave Sexton offered me the contract   And \n<$A>  What did   you do for the two or three, just train with them or   did you play a match \n<$B>  No there was a game   They 'd organised a game against a university team and uhm I 'd played quite well in it I thought We we beat them I think six-nil or something like that\n<$A> And which team was it The first team or   the reserves \n<$B>  No no   this was like uhm   uh an A team  Over there they 've got an A team like a third team   Yeah \n<$A>  A youth team  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$B> There 'd be a  maybe a few reserve team players in it as well plus youth team players So it was kind of like a very young team and that but very , I always remember the skill factor in them was, amazed me you know because I 'd never seen anything like it at that at that age you know what I mean how good they were\n<$A> And how many of those other fellas made it\n<$B> Oh, you 'd be lucky if you 're talking about one, two\n<$A> So probably only you from that team\n<$B>  I 'd probably have been the least likely one as well if you were watching that particular game\n<$A> Mm So you came back over and it was kind of a secret at first wasn't it about you\n<$B> It was because when I went over uhm I didn't want anybody to know about it I just wanted to go over, take in the trial for two or three days, come back and as far as I was concerned I was going to start, continue playing with Dublin and nobody 'd know anything about it I only went over just to see what Old Trafford was was like you know\n<$A> You hadn't been there no\n<$B> What people forget is that the great late Billy Behan, it was his word really that got me over there\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> You know And his word was that well respected by Manchester United\n<$A> Just to explain to people he was the Irish scout who   had sent over  all the Irish players in those years\n<$B>  That 's right  \n<$B> That 's right sent over all those Irish players then at the time And I remember uhm it was based on his word really that I think Dave Sexton turned around and went, that 'll do he 'll do for us\n<$A> Yeah Now, you you didn't have that long with the Dubs really sure you didn't   You 'd  only two or three years\n<$B>  No  \n<$B> I feel as if I 'm I was there an awful lot longer to be honest with you Uhm but actually when I look back on it it 's only like two or three years really\n<$A> And when you go around Ireland, rural Ireland still remembers you in many ways as much for the Dubs as for your whole long soccer career\n<$B> Yeah but not only rural Ireland very much Dublin as well Like uh I 'd I 'd still get more people nearly coming up to me talking about the Dubs and when am I going to come back for the Dubs\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Because I think I always wanted to come back for the Dubs I always intended to come back for the Dubs uhm but as you say they just uh the soccer career went on and on \n<$A> Well we we 've a couple of fellas on the line now to remind you of those uh you 'll need your headphones maybe to hear them Uh uhm we 've Mike Sheehy on the line from Kerry\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> And who 's a big soccer fan as well Hello Mike\n<$C> Hello Des\n<$A> How are you\n<$C> How are you doing\n<$A> Not bad Now those days uh Moran coming into the team when you were All-Ireland champions You wouldn't have known a lot about him sure you wouldn't\n<$C> No Des  Not initially anyway but, I I I remember actually seeing him uh in Tralee sometime He played a played a challenge game with Dublin against Kerry in Tralee sometime I 'd say, early seventy-six probably you know and I remember I was resting I said I was injured but  we usually took breaks in those days during the winter But I remember seeing this guy with long hair anyway running up and down Austin Stack Park I remember a lot of guys talking about him after but little did we know that that evening what he was going to do to us the following September   and a few  other years you know\n<$A>  That 's right  \n<$A> Was that your first ever game for the Dubs\n<$B> That was yeah It was uhm   I can remember I think it was to raise \n<$C>  Hi Kevin  \n<$B> Hi Mikey How are you doing Nice to talk to you\n<$C> Good good good Same here\n<$B> It was uhm it was to raise funds I think for uh Kerry to go to uh America    I was delighted  to do that for youse by the way help youse out in some way I can always say there I did something good for Kerry in seventy-six\n<$A>  Ah cute Kerrymen  \n<$A> Was it Jim said, your brother I can't, I think it was Jim said uh after that that he was glad he went to the bother of going down to watch you cos the way you played he thought you 'd never play for them again\n<$B> That 's right It was me brother Brendan actually said\n<$A> Was it Brendan yeah\n<$B> He said it was the first and only time he thought he 'd ever see me in a blue shirt\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> But uh I remember that now I played mid-field I think\n<$C> That 's right yeah   That 's right  Covering every blade of grass\n<$B>  And uhm  \n<$B> That, I know because I couldn't catch balls then I had to run around the place you see I I I, fortunately for me I was playing soccer at the time as well uhm with uh UCD so I would have been fit more or less all year round whereas most of the other players would have been on their winter break\n<$C> Yeah that 's right that 's right\n<$B> So the least I could have done was to run around the place\n<$A> Well one man who never had the fitness problems was Jimmy Keaveney, Hello Jimmy\n<$D> How are you Des\n<$A> How are you\n<$D> Not too bad\n<$B> Is that Jimmy\n<$A> Are you not working, are you not\n<$D> Jeez you 'd do anything for a few bob Mose Do you know that\n<$A> Listen tell us this about uh when this long-haired fella arrived out to training first None of you knew knew him well Jimmy\n<$D> No he arrived up to Parnell Park he was only a young fella nineteen or twenty at the time And he 'd an old donkey jacket on him, a Honda fifty and he 'd, the arse was out of his trousers Things have changed haven't they\n<$B> I 'll tell you one thing I hate, It was never a Honda fifty by the by the way It was a Honda ninety \n<$D> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> You wouldn't know how to get onto onto one of them now \n<$A> And you were a fairly close-knit team though Jimmy weren't you I mean there weren't many newcomers coming into that team\n<$D> No, one thing I admired about Kevin was we 'd we 'd played I think in two All-Irelands at that stage, and we were all fairly seasoned footballers and like as soon as he came into the team there was no sort of watering period with him He got straight stuck into into the training And like he was telling the senior lads fellas like Cullen, Hanahoe, and myself to get on with the training and like he at this stage he 's not with the team a wet day But I think it 's something we all appreciated He was like a breath of fresh air coming into the team\n<$A> Yeah And and uh the Dublin Kerry rivalry, Mike 's still on the line there That was uh there was huge hype in in the country in those days wasn't there\n<$C> Well we enjoyed it like we had great craic out of it We enjoyed the games We won some and we lost some But I think at the end of the day it was the friends we made with the Kerry lads, and vice versa with them, I think that 's the the enjoyment we got, we got mostly out of it as players anyway\n<$A> Yeah course you might, Kerry got the better of it over the over the three or four years There were highs and lows for the Dubs uh, Kevin do you remember the the run in seventy-six the famous   one  which I was making the point recently that never has a miss been uh  reshown so often I mean you missed   it  but it 's they   keep reshowing it \n<$B>  That 's right yeah  \n<$B>  I know  \n<$C>  But Des sorry   but that particular shot in actual fact and I said it to him after the match, if you hadn't 've drop-kicked that ball\n<$A> Yeah\n<$C> It probably would 've been one of the greatest goals ever seen in Gaelic football If he 'd kicked it normally he would he would 've buried it but he drop-kicked and he screwed her off a wee bit You know", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL",

{"text": "<Tim Pat Coogan>\n\n\n<$A> The first, couple of volumes I see here on your shelves are well-battered and indeed well-read volumes Two volumes, Michael Collins and The Making of a New Ireland by Pearse Be/aslai/ Michael Collins is somebody who 's had a very profound impact on your life and on your work as a historian\n<$B> Indeed and so had Pearse Be/aslai/ Uhm, I 'd heard a lot about Collins from older colleagues of my father 's notably David Nelligan and other people over the years Mickey Rooney, the former editor of The Independent told me about uhm, this extraordinary episode when uh he was called to the governor 's uh wing in uh Crumlin Road Gaol where he was imprisoned And of course the division the  the Civil War was on, the division 'd occurred there too, and he was uhm, brought in by the governor to be told something And the news was that Collins had been shot So he came back out onto the uh gangplank or onto the, iron, staircase whatever it was, and uh he began to announce this to his people, and he was interrupted by the sound of the rosary They all went down simultaneously on their knees, both Free Staters and uh, uh Republicans in Crumlin Road Gaol And the same thing, the same story or a variation of it was told by Tom Barry, so he had that sort of mesmeric effect But uh that particular volume you see there those two, it 's a famous edition, And I first came across it when I was uh writing my first book Ireland Since the Rising back in nineteen sixty-five And I 'd left the Evening Press uh, we started early and you finished about four in the afternoon, and sometime of that, order I went up to the National Library, uh got these out, uh on my reading list, and settled in to read them And I meant to get uh go, break and have a cup a cup of tea And uh I was touched on the the shoulder, by this stage I was nearly through the first of the big books, by one of the attendants whom I knew And I said oh thanks very much I I meant to go out and get my tea I, thanks very much Keep an eye on them I 'll be back He said you will not We 're closing It 's ten o'clock  It was a quarter to ten\n<$A> You were so absorbed\n<$B> I was completely absorbed and then I wanted to buy the books myself They were very hard to get, And the late Tom Kenny, it was a great uh bookshop as you know in Galway, great great book family And Maureen I 'm happy to say is still with us, the wife But he looked out for them and he got them for me for ten pounds People used to say Kenny 's are very dear He got those two for me for ten pounds, And I think they 're, well you 'd pay according to the catalogues well in excess of a hundred now for that edition anywhere\n<$A> I see beside it uh, The Love Poems of Yeats\n<$B> Oh yes uh, yes well I I I 've always been interested in uh  in Yeats of course Uhm, and uh it 's kind of a long story Uh you also see here uhm Nothing Happens in Carmincross by Ben Kiely Uh now I  I uh, launched that for Ben in, again it was under the auspice of Kenny 's if not mistaken, uh uh in Galway And uhm, as I said at the time Nothing Happens in Carmincross, what a misnomer, quite a lot happens Well quite a lot happened that night I can tell you  as a result, But I also uh went along then to the uhm, the launch of the paperback a year later where I uh met a uh my friend, Barbara Haley for the first time your your former colleague too used to uh appear with you a lot in the Arts programme And she was particularly friendly with uhm Norman Jeffares  Gerry Jeffares whom I hadn't met though I 'd admired him from a distance introduced him to me, And uh he rekindled my interest in Yeats because I thought that his uhm, that edition he did the collected edition he did for Macmillan was about the best introduction anybody could have to Yeats Not alone did he 've a good selection, for anybody but his uh notes at the back uh, a lot of people don't read a book in the totality but uh because they 're just dry small print, but he had marvellously illuminating notes, everything from the pronunciation of words, to the local typography, to bits of history, to who the characters were I thought it was a model book, And uhm, it just it happens to be one of the the model poems if you like\n<$A> Are there a few lines of   Yeats that that particularly strike you \n<$B>  Yes a from a   Last Confession,  I gave what other women gave that stepped out of their clothes, but when this soul its body off naked to naked goes, he it is found shall find therein, what none other knows \n<$A> Talking of poetry you 're a big fan of Seamus Heaney   And I see his early volume Field Work here on your shelves \n<$B>  Oh yes of course, Yes,   Well uh Seamus of course is is a wonderful man He 's a wonderful poet Uh, he writes about things uh that we we sort of can identify with But uh apart from that he uhm, he is uhm, blessed with his personality He he 's a very pleasant man and uh very enabling man He gives his time very generously, and he 's no poseur, He 's also a very lucky man I think in a sense that, apart from the fact he he 's a lovely wife, uh, Marie he 's uhm, born at a very good time He uh he 's come to his maturity, in a very benign Ireland for the poet If you consider the reception, that his work is met and his personality is met with in this Ireland, uhm compared to say the treatment of, or the kind of the expected behaviour of people like Kavanagh and uh Behan and Myles na Gopaleen Uhm in a sense they were Ishmael They certainly got no economic support or very little They wrote for peanuts And there was terrific drinking and self-destruction Uh uhm, it 's amazing Kavanagh lived as long as he did Uh you know, the artist destroyed by Dublin is kind of the leitmotif that one sees so many of these people from Seamus O'Sullivan uh you just think of them But Seamus escaped all that, uh takes a drink and all that So I I think he 's just he 's a good model of of what uhm, what uh, Yeats said to Irish poets  scorn uh scorn uh,  things all growing up and Irish poets learn your trade  Well he certainly did that, he learnt his trade you know Uhm Here 's here 's a thing uh he he do you know the the uh Casualty, It 's he uh it 's about Northern Ireland, and he describes the uhm, uhm, Derry and the the  remember that terrible shooting in Derry the Bloody Sunday, Paras thirteen the wall said Bogside nil And then uhm, the other thing was that of course there was great hatred of anybody who had seemed to give aid or support to the troops And this man uh didn't uhm, uh, he he wouldn't sort of give in to the threats to stay home It 's just the the other side the Seamus 's insight into both senses, both sides of the terror Uh he  talks about this man who defied his own people to go out And he said,  but he would not be held at home by his own crowd whatever threats were phoned whatever black flags waved I see him as he turned in that bombed offending place, remorse fused with terror, in his still knowable face His cornered out-face stare, blinding in the flash  It is just, he he 's a man of considerable insight in other words\n<$A> As a former editor and uh long-time journalist I know that you 've a great admiration of Alistair Cooke And I see his volume The Americans, Letters From America nineteen sixty-nine to seventy-nine on your shelves,   Cooke  is an extraordinary   character \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  He 's an extraordinary man   He 's uhm, I suspect he grew up as something of a snob, Uh he was uhm, he was always at the very best tables and uh, married an admiral 's daughter and that sort of thing Uh had entree from uh very high level and in those days, well it 's still, to a large extent the style of England is the style of America but very much more so in his time But instead of just degenerating in to gossip with that, he became probably the most penetrating critic and uh affectionate uh, reporter on America  that uh, well of his day And I don't know whether you 've read his other book the uhm it 's just called Alistair Cooke 's America And it really is it 's full of insight And he he 's ranging from little anecdotes about old people he knows living in the Twinkle Toes Sandy Motel  to, you know, meetings with President Kennedy and so forth And he has something that of course uhm, is is essential for any journalist Energy, accuracy, and great professionalism, a sense of humour so, I  I would certainly commend him to the the younger school\n<$A> He 's also kept alive, that endangered species the radio essay   Hasn't he \n<$B>  Absolutely    I mean the uhm, the Sunday Morning Letter From America now it 's wonderful And if you follow him through he starts off uhm, I I want to tell you today about a man, but first let me say, and you go off for fourteen minutes and the last thirty seconds 're <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> up and suddenly the last uh, sentence would be and that was the man who was shot dead before my very eyes or something like that, you know And he he   really is <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  He has an   extraordinary sense of   completeness  and coming round   to,  a conclusion  and taking you, almost in a way like Ben Kiely\n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B>  Absolutely  \n<$A> I was going to say, you took the words out of my mouth  He 's the he 's the uhm, the transatlantic equivalent of Ben because Ben goes in a circumlocutory way all around the Lagan Valley, and he finally comes back to closing time in Mulligan 's where the anecdote began And he also remembers the punchline And of course he also has a wonderful radio voice, And he 's also a a was a very fine journalist and is a very fine writer\n<$A> A man you knew well in your Irish Press days was Brendan Behan   and you have his  complete plays here, uh introduced by Alan Simpson\n<$B>  Oh I did yeah  \n<$B> Mm\n<$A> Uhm, it 's so difficult now to separate Behan the man from the myth isn't it\n<$B> It 's very hard I mean he would certainly be one of the artist destroyed figures You know uh he felt the headlong rush was the only thing He had to psych himself up very often I think, uh for appearances you know And the way to do that is to be drunk uh, you know, interrupting plays in the West End shouting from this the audience This brought headlines in the Daily Mail and that brought box office And then he uhm, it went on from there you know He made very penetrating remarks Well I remember Judith Crist who was then the editor of the Arts in the uhm, Herald Tribune saying to me that uh, she thought what he said about the uh Saint Patrick 's Day uh  procession was perfectly spot-on and should be said, namely that it wasn't an Irish festival, that it was uh a show of strength for the  Ancient Order of Hibernians Now I don't agree with that, but however, that 's what Judith felt And uh she said then paused, but he shouldn't 've been drunk when he said it", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source":

're you 're, you 're more European than he was, you 've advanced Would would I be right in that\n<$B> Well I I 'm not sure it is Uhm I I think the age that, well I mean the eighties has been, has funnily enough, you know, some of my music when 'twas released in America got put on the New Age rack And I was  once asked by somebody was I insulted at this I 'm not really Do you know I mean most of the New Age stuff one sees is really like horrible Uh uh, but but I 'm not really But but there is, there is something of the times that if one, expresses, a time that one lives in and the time we live in now is uh, is actually a searching by all kinds of people for the spirit\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> And if for many people uh institutionalised religion has soured for them, or for some reason or another, I think, that they feel for whatever reason they need to go beyond it or, beneath it or, beside it, uhm it 's a time like that and there 's a there is a lot of that I think, of that timelessness in music right now But I do believe music is political I do believe that all music all true music, is political I do think it 's a political statement because it 's a it 's a statement of where you are, at a particular point of time And I strongly believe that I mean, okay it 's easy to see particularly in, like nationalistic music   you know  And if you pick for example you mentioned O/ Riada if you pick an obvious one there Mise E/ire\n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Okay you associate it with the images of the film Mise E/ire and all of that and the <unclear> words </unclear>\n<$A> Well it 's not only the images The very   <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> personality of it \n<$B>  Yes yes   absolutely agree If it were just the music on its own you still would   feel that \n<$A>  You 'd say   that 's Ireland\n<$B> Yeah that 's Ireland That 's right And it 's uh that particular kind of feeling about Ireland, you know which  one be   describe it as cultural nationalist, I \n<$A>  You you, it 's   also about Ireland\n<$B> Well it is about Ireland but you know it 's the time The time is you we we cannot uh afford, to relax into that comfortable feeling of culture and nationalism anymore\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> And I 'm you know like, uh, I would feel part of a generation, which was uh at the uh, at the cutting edge but certainly we were the first ones to bang into the wall of the problem of globalisation and global culture\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> And I think rather than resisting this, uhm I think we should help it along I think we should actively, seek, uhm you know that that concept of the human family as a as a global family Now where nationalism goes in the middle of all of that I don't know I don't think it need be thrown out but it 's a kind of a post-nationalism, in a way, that 's the way I would describe it\n<$A> Because there are European, American influences in your music at least, so it seems to me\n<$B> Oh there 's no question about that you   know \n<$A>  Jazz   for instance   and <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and \n<$B>  Absolutely very much, Absolutely   and the piano of course is a very cosmopolitan, suave instrument   you know , And to play it with uh, to play Irish music on it, you know it 's a bit like, you know playing it with wellingtons on or something, do you know  Uh that, I mean, like there is that  I remember a reviewer once in a UK magazine, uh said that uh when he heard the record I had done said it sounded like a pint of Guinness was pouring into the piano  And that was a bit mean But, there is an Irishness and the Irishness for me in the music, piano music I play is like an anchor, a vital anchor\n<$A>  Mm mm  \n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> I don't want to leave go of it because if I feel I do, in the context of this globalisation, well I 'm out to sea  With no  uh and no compass, no sense of where I am So I do believe in roots,\n<$A> You 're searching in your I remember uh in the Oilea/n Suite the   Suite Oilea/n  you, uh put on top of one the pieces a quotation of Nuala Ni/ Dho/mhnaill 's for instance   Uh  <&Irish> Oilea/n 'se/ mo chorp oilea/n mar i muire </&Irish> My body, is an island in the midst of a vast sea And uh, a lot of your music seems to be, have a kind of a melancholy about the human condition And it 's uh otherwise its joyful but there 's a melancholia uh going through, it 's in the searching Am I wrong in that\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Ah, yeah  \n<$B> Uh I I I think that 's true, Ah no I really think it 's true I remember somebody describing to me once uh saying, uhm, that uhm one of, the human being 's most pleasant feelings, is the one of sweet sadness You know that   combination  of the two And that, there 's a  uh a melancholic thing about that There 's also a nostalgic thing There 's a feeling of, being somewhere other than where you should be and you want to be there\n<$A>  Mm  \n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> And all of that kind of feeling Music is a wonderful way of of expressing that, Uh so, you know there 's a wonderful word too in Irish, <&Irish> uaigneas </&Irish> That 's uh uh people say it 's very difficult to translate, into English Loneliness is too blunt a word\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> And <&Irish> uaigneas </&Irish>, is something that uh some of us would claim you can hear, even in certain players playing fast music, a reel which is supposed to be joyous, but it 's tinged in some way or other, with this colour of <&Irish> uaigneas </&Irish>\n<$A> Mm, like the music of Tommy Potts He was admired so much on the fiddle\n<$B> Potts, yes that 's a wonderful example I I was just talking to students about that today And, I mean there was a passionate and spiritual man you know And his music is just uh shot through with with spirit, in a most wonderful way\n<$A> Are you a  religious individual would you say\n<$B> Uhm I 'm,   uhm uhm  yes Uh no I would think yes Yes in the sense that I would pray, uh in the sense that I couldn't imagine, life without a belief in a loving God You know it just doesn't make sense to me So yes I am religious In that sense I suppose I 'm very religious, but not necessarily in an institutionalised sense Uhm\n<$A>  Belief in God  \n<$A> It always seems to me that the very fact of music, is one of the proofs of the existence of God\n<$B> Well I mean you know I I certainly 'd be the last person to argue against that On the other hand, I think I can imagine a good musician who said he was, an atheist, Oh yes You know uh which doesn't necessarily prove that God doesn't exist either I mean he may be his own, proof of the it he 's the validity of his own argument   Do you know <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> yeah \n<$A>       that people people can write music and appreciate it both seems to me to be a suggestion that there is something more to the human being, uh than, we can perceive   You know \n<$B>  Well you   know when you really come up against it It 's when you bring art into the marketplace You know that 's where the sparks fly you see, because if there is spirit in it and you,   there 's, one thing you can't sell it 's that of course even  if you know it 's there\n<$A>  Yeah, yeah  \n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> It 's just unsaleable\n<$A> Yeah but you 've brought it into the marketplace\n<$B> Yes I know I suppose that 's why I 'm saying it because in a way I 'm speaking to some degree from experience Luckily, not too much into the market as I haven't been faced with, certain problems which would obviously come up if you begin to do that But I have my toes have dipped into the water <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> \n<$A> Yes and uh some of your stuff it seems to me even <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> is, uh you could sell that as a single,\n<$B> Yeah uh funnily enough it was supposed to 've come out as a single   As it is  it never happened you know with the London uh Chamber Orchestra But, yeah it has it has it it does You know I don't deliberately write music which is potentially popular, but some of the music I would write or or or work out, on the keyboard or otherwise, happens to be in the realms of popularity You know I am fortunate or unfortunate whatever way you want to look at it, uh to actually be dealing with those materials of sound I have friends who, who work, exclusively with sounds which are just not tangible, for, you know ninety-nine percent of the people You know when I say it 's just it 's just that 're meaningless\n<$A>  <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>  \n<$A> Like\n<$B> Well I 'm I 'm thinking actually of an Irish composer called Gerald Barry, in particular, who is a Clare man and who lives in Dublin and who wrote, spent ten years of his life writing an opera, called The Intelligence Park which got its premiere in London and Dublin, this summer, And uh he 's a friend of mine and, he sent me on a a cassette copy of The Intelligence Park which I 've been listening a lot to, And I think it 's extremely complex music I I couldn't ask, most of my friends to listen to it You know, I know they would have a huge problem, But I mean I myself am full of admiration uh for it But what I 'm saying is that somebody like him and many others work uh with materials of sound which are all fanatically not popular I mean let me tell you that these are not popular  under any circumstances\n<$A> No tunes\n<$B> Any any marketplace You , know in that sense no tunes or, you know uhm no\n<$A> Do you think a melody should have tunes or\n<$B> No I don't think so No I I really I I I don't necessarily think so, I I think it 's possible to have, yeah I think it 's possible to have music without, without   tunes \n<$A>  All   your  music has\n<$B> Oh very yes it 's very melodic Yeah   there 's no  question about that yeah\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Do you think it shouldn't be or, are you striving to go, beyond the melody\n<$B> I 'm striving to go yes I 'm  no not so much beyond I I would I am  what I do in music seems to be increasingly as I get older to be to be intimately linked to the to the development of my own personality And to me music is, a sound that you send out a bit like a scout, to check, the ground, and to clear the overgrowth, and then you enter into the space It seems to me that when I write music which is worth writing it 's ahead of me And there 's always such tension then that you you may well put it behind you, you see\n<$A> This is a very complex statement\n<$B> Well well I don't know I mean it 's thinking that music uh is simply uh can be ahead of a person and ahead of society\n<$A> Yeah that 's something that a painter said to me the other day that when he starts off, with a brush loaded with paint and confronts a canvas he doesn't quite know what he 's going   to, do  He hopes, that he, starts off very simply, and hopes that he can elaborate, that something will appear\n<$B>  Yeah yeah", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a0fa73b4-41e1-4add-b5fb-c37ccaedc52a", "added":

{"text": "<Trinity students>\n\n\n<$A> Student affairs, including clubs and societies, are administered by five groups, the Students ' Union, the Graduate Students ' Union, The Publications Committee, DUCAC, and the Central Societies Committee, who mainly control the cash The CSC has a budget approaching one hundred and seventy thousand pounds for its eighty plus societies Its chairperson is Mary Butler\n<$B> It 's actually, what you might call the governing body of all the student societies in Trinity It has various functions, basically administration and that We seek our capitation fee from the Capitation Committee, and then distribute that fairly between the ninety student societies here in Trinity We also provide facilities, for the societies up here in our offices And, act of, what you might call court of appeal if any disputes arrive arise, between societies or   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  So you 're   in a very, lofty position then\n<$B> You could call it that I   guess \n<$A>  I mean   you give out the cash\n<$B> We do indeed yes\n<$A> What facilities do you offer\n<$B> Ehm as you can see from the outside office we have, a number of computers, telephone lines, a fax machine, photocopying, stuff like that, which are practical facilities for the societies We also provide we 've staff members who help do up posters or invitations anything that societies may need to help them function in their day-to-day activities,\n<$A> And uhm, what sort of interest do the students themselves have in this\n<$B> In the societies   are they , There actually is a great interest I think, every student going through college will at some stage, join at least one society, if not more I think Freshers ' Week, is a great week where first years probably join about ten societies and then decide after one year, weedle out the ones they 're interested in,   Uh \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  What   do you think are the most famous societies,\n<$B> Uhm, I suppose historically, the Philosophical Society and the Historical Society\n<$A> What do you think are the liveliest societies,\n<$B> Well the Science Fiction Society would be one of our largest and most, probably one of our most active\n<$A> In your experience Mary what sort of student comes to Trinity How would you describe the, kind of, typical Trinity student\n<$B> I think the image of  the Trinity student has changed a lot throughout the years I think now there 're more I think if you go into any school around, the Dublin area or around the country, pick any student, they could be a  a Trinity student I I don't think there is a typical Trinity student   anymore \n<$A>  Yet the   perception 's often that Trinity is a fairly posh expensive middle-class institution\n<$B> Well this is it This is the perception I think that 's being reinforced somewhat by, you know, even now the the the promotion of the Trinity student being a very posh student I don't think that 's the case In my class alone I 'd say, the majority are working-class students And I think that is the case throughout Trinity as a whole now It 's it 's not no longer, a posh upper-class student\n<$A> Hello This is Jimmy Smith the, famous Clare hurler How are you Jimmy\n<$C> Very good thanks Brendan,   Nice to meet you \n<$A>  Well what 're you   doing in college\n<$A> Well I 'm I 'm back after thirty-five years in the wilderness, back doing Philosophy,\n<$A> And you 're enjoying   it \n<$C>  Yeah   I love it yeah   It 's grand to be back \n<$A>  Are you a member of   any society yourself\n<$C> I 'm not really Now I 'm joining the the Hurling Club here I see and I 've decided to join it,\n<$A> That brings   back memories alright \n<$C>  That brings   back memories Yeah it does It 's nice to see these fellas coming in from the country in here and doing it in their spare time There 's a lot of hard work here, and this 'd be a great kind of sideline for them during the course of the year\n<$A> You chose a fairly difficult   subject but I,  I suppose a good hurler is capable of doing anything\n<$C>  Ah it 's very I <unclear> words </unclear>  \n<$C> Well you see when you 're training for a number of years and you you   every hurler is a philosopher in his own way Because everybody you see and uh you meet on the pitch, you have to  you have to size them up You have to know what they 're thinking You have to see them, you have to know what they 're thinking before they actually get to the ball\n<$D> Man is a very young fresher, just trying to get him to join hurling and football clubs like you know He 's from Wexford so he 's probably no good but we 'll sign him up anyway like, you know\n<$A> Which part of Wexford are you from\n<$E> I 'm from, outside New Ross called Campile\n<$A> And is uh is uh football popular there\n<$E> Oh it 's fairly fairly popular yeah GAA is very you know, it 's doing well like, you know what I mean It 's uh, it 's a fairly good club down there alright\n<$A> And what 're you going to , what, which club are you going to join here\n<$E> Oh I 'll join the both of them and be damned you know uh sort of  , the  hurling and football club\n<$A>  Did you  \n<$A> You might get a game with either the   football or the hurling club \n<$E>  It 's uh you never   know you know It 's uh There you go lads\n<$D> We 've got the we 've got the League Cup here the University League which we 've won for the last two years, and which is a great uh achievement for Trinity like because before that uh the club was uh, you know it it was struggling to survive We  we didn't have the the members Uh it 's only in the last few years Mr Kennelly 'll tell you when he came to college, there was there was a very small take But in the last few years we 've got far more members And we we ended up beating UCD, which for any Trinity team is the ultimate in success No matter what you win, if you beat UCD, that, I mean that is uh that is heaven And we beat UCD in the in the Fitzgibbon Shield two years ago, and uh it was probably the greatest achievement uh on the field that the club has ever had\n<$F> I 've just signed up to the fencers, the college fencers, who I didn't know about I never knew there was fencers until, a couple of weeks ago and I was  when I was looking them up to help to be involved in this thing that I 'm doing at the moment a a thing for players a show for players And uhm, I went down and they had so much fun doing it And there was actually a  uh a woman running the thing and she 's been running it for the last six years\n<$G> I used the weight room facility in college for exercising I exercise from physiotherapy that I had to do, And that 's a terrifly  male-dominated To go into the gym then there I, the stink of male sweat as  soon as you open the door And then after that it 's there 's there 's uh burly men there lifting weights And I mean women really are looked as, You you 're told to use the weight machines because really you 're only down here for toning your muscles\n<$?> DUCAC ahm, the the retreat for every man in college who feels he 's being harassed or intimidated by us women,\n<$A> DUCAC, that sweating centre of males, happily harassed by women, is administered by Cathy Doyle one of the most popular staff members in Trinity Cathy talks to Maura Lee about the Central Athletic Committee\n<$H> The initials, DUCAC stand for, Dublin University Central Athletic Committee, and it is a committee of around twenty people, made up of students and members of staff at the college\n<$I> Where does DUCAC get its funds from\n<$H> DUCAC gets, most of its funds, from the Capitation Committee in college When the students come into college, as well as paying their fees, they pay a capitation fee which is approximately fifty pounds All these fifty pounds go into a fund, administered by the Capitation Committee, and that money is distributed among five bodies in Trinity, of which DUCAC is one\n<$I> So basically DUCAC uhm administers funds and controls the clubs, the sporting clubs in college Is that it\n<$H> We don't actually control them, but we, they come to us They apply to DUCAC for grants, so that they can hold their fixtures so they can travel away to, on tours, uhm so that they can host visiting teams in Trinity, so that they could either go to intervarsities, or host intervarsities, And they apply to us for funds Our committee of twenty people sit down and we discuss the grants, and decide how the money is going to be spent And then the clubs come back to see how well they got on or how well they didn't get on  And I administer the money uh distribute it to the to the clubs\n<$I> So you 're a fairly important lady if you control the money, the purse strings\n<$H> They think I am \n<$I> And which are the bigger clubs,\n<$H> The swimming club is the, for the last few years has been the biggest club For some reason swimming is very very popular\n<$I> I would 've thought maybe the football club might 've   been the biggest \n<$H>  The, the   football club is a big club, It 's one of the older clubs as well in the, in  in the college\n<$I> Is it something to do with being around young people that you enjoy\n<$H> I think that 's it Yeah I do enjoy being round young people, The one thing I, find very, ah maybe unusual isn't the word, difficult maybe, is that the majority of people that are there are only there for four years, So if you have made very good friends of some students unfortunately they 're gone Now we do, people I have got friendly with and maybe they 've gone to America and things like that they would still, contact me when they come back into Dublin and things like that And we would meet But it 's not maybe like in a workplace, where, you 'd be working with the same people for fourteen years or fifteen years There is a turnover all the time of students\n<$I> Do you see much of a change in the students over the years\n<$H> Uh they 're more sophisticated They seem to be more I feel they 're more dress-conscious I also think they are more studious That they had to work so hard to get into college in the first instance I feel they seem to worry more about their exams In the first term, that is sort of October to December, it 's not important at all Second term maybe they realise, hey I 've done nothing this year And then when third term comes you don't see them at all Uhm, they realise, I 've exams in May you know, I 'd better get the head down Where I think maybe ten years ago, the pressure on exams and that, that wasn't there \n<$A> Colm O'Dwyer you 're the Entertainments Officer of the Students ' Union Uh, what precisely do you do\n<$J> I run uh, pretty much all the student entertainment that goes on in the college, that 's the uhm, the concerts we 'd have in The Buttery, which is pretty much every night of the week, all the Balls throughout the year, and then I 'd, be in charge I 'm Music Officer for the Trinity Ball, so I 'd organise that end of things for that", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e9efec60-6101-48e6-91ac-d521158365ec", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.282480+00:00"}
{"text": "<Queen's Speech>\n\n\n<$A> Thank-you Mr Chairman This uh I think has been a very good idea to have a debate on the Queen 's Speech, and I I look forward to comments made by other participants, The first point I want to make with regard to the Queen 's Speech uh is the what I think is the the insensitivity of the draftsman who placed the reference to Northern Ireland uh within the section of the Queen 's Speech dealing with foreign affairs\n<$B> Hear-hear\n<$A> Now this is something to which we take exception, Uh we did manage to uh get it moved, the reference to Northern Ireland moved to the right section of the Queen 's Speech a number of years ago, but there, matters have slid back, on this And it was for that reason that the Ulster Unionist Party yesterday tabled an amendment to the Humble Address, uh an amendment actually in exactly the same terms as an amendment we tabled twenty years ago And uh I would invite other Members of the house, uh to subscribe, other Members of this Forum who are also Members of the House of Commons, to consider subscribing their names to that amendment to the Humble Address as a way, means of showing uh our uh, disappointment at the this form of reference The purpose of the Queen 's Speech is to announce the Government 's legislative programme for the forthcoming year And as has been mentioned, the only legislative proposal in the Queen 's Speech relating to Northern Ireland uh was the provision for legislation on decommissioning  and we found the reference in the Queen 's Speech not entirely satisfactory The phrase \" They stand ready to introduce legislation to provide for the  decommissioning of firearms \" is too passive, and we expected to see a more positive commitment I do have to say that the Prime Minister in his speech and again the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland last night in reply to myself uh did make it clear that they uh do actually intend to introduce legislation But at the same time uh the Leader of the House was unable to give a date for the Second Reading when asked to do so, And this I found quite disappointing because we 'd been given to understand that the legislation would be introduced and enacted during November And I think we would need to move rapidly on this And of course, that would then give us the opportunity in the House to take up some of the points made by Mr McCartney with regard to the very obvious gap in the legislation, namely the failure to provide for the decommissioning of terrorist weapons in Great Britain And that is an obvious gap and one which I think will have to be addressed And of course in so doing, we 'll have the opportunity perhaps to have some explanation as to why uh the present draft of the Bill does not contain or provide for such decommissioning There is another bigger gap in the whole concept of it The the object of the Queen 's Speech is to announce legislation And as members of the Forum know there is a whole raft of government legislative proposals for Northern Ireland that weren't in the Queen 's Speech, And these are the proposals that some members will be aware of uh that were referred to in a a letter which we received from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the fourteenth of November, setting out his Northern Ireland legislative programme Now uh it has come to our party I think other parties too may also have received this  Uh sorry fourteenth of October I should have said, uh setting out his legislative programme Now the question is, why is there not a proper statement on this, why is there not a proper debate on the Government 's legislative programme for Northern Ireland Now this might, Mr Chairman be an issue that this Forum could take up Indeed uh if the Secretary of State we we have asked in the past the Secretary of State to make a statement to the House of Commons containing his legislative programme so that he could be asked questions about it, and he has regularly declined to do so Perhaps this Forum might like to consider inviting the Secretary of State to come, and explain to the people of Northern Ireland his legislative programme for Northern Ireland And that is something that we could take up at that stage I 'll not go through the or touch further on the proposals on this but I think this is a very positive way in which this Forum uh could pursue the matter and I hope that is done\n<$X> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$A> Uh not in the limited time available I 'm sorry I have only ten minutes and I am not uh,  prepared to to to risk further uh inroads on it The other issue that comes to mind in connection with the Queen 's Speech and the debate on it is the whole question of uh ceasefire decommissioning and what is to happen to the inter-party talks Now here I notice uh a  certain movement by the Government uh in a sensible direction, uh and this I 'm here referring to the uh comments made by the Prime Minister in his speech, uh to the House, on Wednesday afternoon, where referring to uh Sinn Fe/in and IRA and the possibility of ceasefires and so on, uh he said that IRA and Sinn Fe/in should be under no illusion that they can join the process until they have demonstrated real commitment to democratic and non-violent methods Now an emphasis on the need for a real commitment to democratic and non-violent methods is welcome, as indeed was the reference in the subsequent sentence uh by the Prime Minister to soft words not being sufficient Now however, while that represents a move in the right direction, I don't think it moves far enough\n<$B> Hear-hear\n<$A> And I think what we need uh is to have a clearer definition It might have been possible it might have been justifiable uh in nineteen ninety-four to make working assumptions in the hope that people were moving in the right direction But having now had clear and irrefutable uh evidence that they weren't moving in the right direction and indeed that the whole ceasefire was duplicitous from the outset then I think we can't just rely on general  statements of that nature And we need to have a clear definition from the Government as to what is a satisfactory ceasefire And I think that is necessary, as indeed is a clear response from the Government on the question of decommissioning and as Members, as fellow Delegates know uh we in the Ulster Unionist Party set out our position on this in the paper we published on the thirtieth of September which sets down what I think is the irreducible minimum in terms of uh commitments with regard to that issue And we need these matters because uh as the Prime Minister said on Wednesday with regard to Sinn Fe/in, of the attitude of Sinn Fe/in is plainly incompatible with joining the talks They have excluded themselves by their return to violence Note the past tense, they have excluded themselves And they, that should be the case There should not now be any serious suggestion of introducing Sinn Fe/in into the talks And the talks should go on in their absence\n<$?>  Hear-hear\n<$A> And that is what we earnestly hope will happen Uh as to whether talks proceeding in the absence of Sinn Fe/in would be successful or not is a matter that time will tell, Uh we are not scared of the prospect of talks, We have confidence in our ability and confidence in our arguments, We are prepared to present the argument for the Unionist case, whatever the context may be, and whether the talks succeed or not depends on the attitude of all the parties concerned And if it turns out that the Irish Government and Irish Nationalists are not prepared to go on without Sinn Fe/in then the responsibility for the failure in the talks will be theirs If on the other hand it turns that if they are prepared to go on and to try and seek agreement with us, that is good And we will see if we can find an agreement with them that protects the democratic rights of the people of Northern Ireland including their right to determine their constitutional destiny If other parties are not prepared to agree with that well then the responsibility will be with them But I cannot see any possible good in Unionists volunteering for the blame for failure Let, if failure occurs let the blame lie with those who have not and are not prepared to acknowledge and respect the democratic rights of the people of Northern Ireland It is our job to vindicate those rights uh in this Forum and elsewhere, and that the Ulster Unionist Party will do\n<$?>  Hear-hear\n<$C> Dr Paisley\n<$D> Mr Chairman I don't think we can take any comfort whatsoever today from anything the Prime Minister says The Prime Minister at this moment is in cahoots with the Republic 's Government to try and find a way to get Sinn Fe/in into these talks, and anybody that knows anything about the political situation in our province today knows that Mr uh Spring is making the running, and that the uh the British Government are simply tagging on I don't think either that the poor draftsman of this document should be blamed The Government should be blamed for the position that they have put this in And if ever there was an insult to the people of Northern Ireland this was the most insulting thing because they said they will maintain close and friendly relations with the Republic of Ireland, a Government that makes a claim against this country, a territorial claim, and yet they were more uh uh keen to get in their last sentence, close and friendly relations with the Republic of Ireland The Republic of Ireland are beavering away, and the the the British Government are going to go along with an attempt to get Sinn Fe/in into the talks and I don't take any comfort from anything the Prime Minister has said at this juncture In fact his civil servants are busy talking to these gunmen and terrorists at the present time along with the civil servants of the South of Ireland And as long as these sort of talks are going on the Prime Minister 's words are meaningless and reek with the the hypocrisy that he used on another occasion uh when he said his stomach would turn over to think of people talking to the IRA when for the past two years before that his civil servants were doing exactly that So anybody that takes any comfort from anything Mr Major is saying at the present time is a fool, because there 's no comfort for us in that There 's only one thing that we can do, and that is to make our views known in the clearest possible way, that there is no place for Sinn Fe/in at these talks\n<$?> Hear-hear\n<$D> And there 's no place for any parties that persist in holding on to their murder weapons And this Forum should be aware today, and it is a very important awareness that they should have, that we 're not having legislation for decommissioning We 're having legislation for an amnesty That 's what it 's about, an amnesty Now, I met along with the representatives of the UK Unionists the Secretary of State We discussed the matter of this legislation He made it absolutely clear that the deal was done, He made it  like, absolutely clear that the deal was this, that in Northern Ireland the guns would not be handed over to the Government, they 'd be hand over to an independent body who would immediately destroy them, There would be no examination, that there would be an undertaking given that no terrorist who it could be proved from forensic uh prima facie case that they were  engaged in using that gun for a murder that that person could never be brought to any court to stand trial, and he would be absolutely free The the Secretary of State Mr Trimble needn't mumble This is what the Secretary of State told us And he told us and witnesses Many people were at that meeting That 's what he told us And he also said of course across the water that wouldn't be, because when the guns came in they would examine them and if they could get evidence that they were used against anyone those people would be brought to court So we have an undermining of the Union in that here where they should be bringing in legislation to defend the Union and maintain it, they 're prepared to sell it out to the IRA and the terrorists But across the water of course, they 're not going to do that There 's going to be two laws in this United Kingdom I must say to this House today that no-one who has committed a crime can, have an amnesty They have got to be tried for their crime And I would say one other thing, and I deeply resent it, and we told the Secretary of State this, when Mr McCrea my colleague said to him what about the people whose loved ones were victims to these crimes and were murdered by these weapons He said sure we have no evidence Willie at the moment against these people What difference does it make Well I want to say that that language from the Secretary of State shows the way the British Government are moving And they are going to move to get Sinn Fe/in in to these talks I thought that the leader of the Official Unionists today would have spelt out clearly his proposals about a sort of half-way house, that Sinn Fe/in can come in, according to his proposals, they can come in uh to a half-way house and then eventually if they keep certain conditions they can come in to the full house I don't want  to see Sinn Fe/in in any half-way house or in any full house, because these people have no right to claim to be democrats, no right to claim that they have should have any say whatsoever in the future discussions about this province But I 'd have the House to note that the Government 's position is, it must be based on a comprehensive political settlement commanding widespread support Every Unionist should know that the widespread support is only needed among Nationalists That 's all that 's needed If they get widespread support among Nationalists, they don't mind They will go ahead with their particular deal Uh you 're getting a bit anxious uh Mr Chairman I see by your face, What time have I to stop\n<$C> No you 're okay You 've four, three minutes", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL",

{"text": "<Potato industry>\n\n\n<$A> I 'd like to  associate myself sir with your remarks Uh we are indebted as a Forum uh to uh Standing Committee D uh for their work in the agriculture and fisheries field And of course we are indebted to them for this report I 'd like just to make a few remarks upon the importance of maintaining the potato industry in Northern Ireland I had a deputation from young people some in farming and some anxious to go into farming I see some of the delegation actually in the galleries today, and they pointed out to me that because of the BSE it is really impossible uh to go into meat production The quota system uh keeps them from entering into dairy farming except they have money to purchase quotas and and uh the seed potato industry and ware industry are the two industries that there is an open door Now, it may be an open door but it 's not an open door to fruitful uh occupation, because if you take the the price of getting ground and the price of the work and the sowing of the seed there is really no profit in the this business today and that means another door is shut to those young people who want uh to enter into farming Agriculture is of course the basic industry of our economy and any weakening of that basis is a weakening to the whole economy and I think it is a very sad thing the attitude that down through the years DANI has taken to the potato industry I was just thinking today that in the prior Assembly we had a similar crisis because of very bad weather, when farmers especially in the South Down area uh seed farmers were almost put out of business and many of them put out of business And we found uh a a a a resistance in every recommendation made to try and ease the plant the the  ease the plight of potato farmers It seems that DANI have an attitude of resistance uh to doing anything really solid financially uh for the potato industry And in fact it was the only meeting of the committee and I happened to be chairing the committee at the time that there was a real bust-up and  and potato farmers and civil servants almost came to fisticuffs uh uh at that particular time because of the attitude of DANI And I think it is it 's a disgrace, an absolute disgrace that they can't find sixty-six thousand pounds uh to uh uh to waive the inspection fees for certification I mean I think that 's an absolute disgrace that here is an industry in uh a dire peril of being destroyed and DANI can't raise sixty-six thousand pounds uh which is a very little help but at least it would be something I mean it 's absolutely ridiculous, and I think that the baroness who flies the world and tells people in all sections of the world uh what they can do to support industry, she should support the industry at home that has been down through the years solidly and quietly doing a very good job of work without one penny piece being received from government Surely now, to save this industry and to keep it from going the way that the flax industry went uh she needs to be even-handed and instead of saying to people of different colour of skin, different colour, uh different uh type of culture, oh you 're welcome in Northern Ireland and here 's the money on the table she should look at the colour of the skin of the Ulster farmers and she should do something for them And I hope that today she gets a clear message, she gets a clear message uh from this House that charity begins at home and she should start at home to look after the best interests of the Ulster people I salute the young people of Northern Ireland who want to enter into farming and I think that they should be supported but how can they enter into this uh particular uh type of employment when the doors are closed and any door that 's open is not a fruitful door to them So I think the time has now come uh for this Forum to say to the baroness, you have got to look at financial support uh for uh the industry How different is the attitude of the Republic 's government uh to its farmers How different And when we think that they have squeezed out of Europe six millions a day, when we haven't even got out of Europe what we have paid in by head of our population even to this present day shows how the Republic knows how to exploit its opportunities in Europe and elsewhere for the best interests of its people Surely we should be ahead in this particular field And I trust that today that this report uh will be highlighted by the media who seem to be very good at highlighting differences in this Forum but don't seem to be so great at highlighting those things that we all can agree on and for the are for the betterment of all of the people of Northern Ireland One other thing I might mention before I close I think it 's time we had a farmers ' retirement scheme in keeping with with what is happening in the Continent so that those wanting to leave the farming industry and leave it to the younger elements have an opportunity to leave it supported uh by the years that they have served in their life in farming employment I think that this is a very important debate It 's a pity that we 're not going to have the report of our committee after they visit uh the the uh Loughgall and elsewhere but that 's just one of the happenings that come in political life but this report I trust will be completed eventually because it 's an historic document and it needs to be put on the record what the public representatives of Northern Ireland thought upon this crisis matter at this time Thank-you\n<$B> Thank-you Dr Paisley Mr Kieran McCarthy please\n<$C> Thank-you thank-you very much Mr Chairman\n<$B> I I see you 've only just arrived Would you like me to defer it, call you later\n<$C> Oh no, Mr Chairman, I I 'm quite sure that uh what I have wanted to say would probably have been said already I simply would pay tribute Mr Chairman to our our the chairman of our committee Mr David Campbell and indeed to all the members uh for the very business like and constructive manner in which this report was put together Also uh I would pay tribute as I 'm sure has been paid, done before to Mr Barnes and his staff for the all the back-up that he has given to our committee Mr Chairman the potato industry has got to be regarded as very important Certainly from the representations made to our Committee by the people who are engaged in this activity it would appear that very little support has been forthcoming uh from the Department of Agriculture And I 'm sure members of this Forum are angry that this should be the case, and indeed Mr Chairman if we look at the very first page of the report, comparison is now being made with what happened to our once-thriving flax industry\n<$B> Uh sorry to interrupt you we we did have this already  that 's that 's a remark of Mr Donnelly I think about the flax   industry \n<$C>  Exactly   Well I think it 's worth uhm it 's worth repeating because if  if we do not do anything now we will in a few years ' time be in the same position as the flax   industry and \n<$B>  Yes   I  I think we all agree with that\n<$D> Exactly Mr Chairman our report says that this must not be allowed to happen Most of the important part points of the the report I 'm sure have been made by other members, and the  recommendations Mr Chairman are reasonable, and I 'm sure that this Forum will be fully supportive of the contents of the report and the recommendation, the recommendations In conclusion Mr Chairman I have said it before and I say it again, the Ulster people, the Northern Irish people, us, as representatives of those people should and could be in charge of our own affairs and undoubtedly would make a better job not only of our potato industry but of everything else to do with Northern Ireland If we could only rise above the prejudices and suspicions, and come together  to form a partnership administration I hear growls and moans there Well shame on those people that are growling and moaning because we have the we have the power we have the will to get together if they would only catch themselves on and come together It could be done Mr Chairman I 've no doubt that it will be done sometime Let us make it sooner rather than later I appeal to all Members of this elected Forum to put our country before party and then we shall all enjoy  prosperity and peace Mr Chairman I sincerely hope that the powers that be at this moment in time will read this report and act uh on it immediately Thank-you very much Mr Chairman\n<$B> Thank-you Mr McCarthy Mr Bob McCartney\n<$D> Uh Mr Chairman let me immediately say, that the remarks of Mr McCarthy uhm are of considerable interest insofar as as I understand it there are Nationalist potato farmers, and it is singularly unfortunate that in the thirst for unanimity and concord uh the representatives largely of that community have chosen to absent themselves so uh really uh I think Mr McCarthy is is really addressing his remarks to the absent members uh and and that is that should be the real object of it Let me let me say Mr Chairman that I would like to join with you and the other members of the Forum in congratulating Mr Campbell and his committee on the excellence of their report Uh the chairman is certainly to be congratulated because he has brought to this a background of farming experience, of rational analysis, and of uh, assiduity and and determination,  and he is to he is to be be congratulated for doing that He 's also to be, he 's also to be congratulated for the the manner in which uh in in in which this report has been put together and and the things it has highlighted But I would like to comment that while these recommendations are all very very important, there is perhaps an absence of emphasis on the need for urgency There are some young potato farmers here today whom I have consulted with and I think also Dr Paisley has has mentioned the same issue They are in serious danger of going under, financially and professionally and at a time when Baroness Denton and the other Ministers of State are talking about how they are going to divide up the money they 're going to take it from the ACE scheme, they 're going to give it to the IDB Some money, some substantial immediate funds should be allotted to the preservation of jobs that have been the staple backbone of Northern Ireland 's economy since nineteen twenty-one We are paying out money to attract multinationals and I agree, their business and and the the employment they provide is essential But we are ignoring the backbone of this community which has been agricultural and the farmers, who have worked for generations What we need is an immediate grant Because it 's rather like saying you know to someone who is drowning in the water, Mr Chairman, well look don't worry old chap There 'll be a rescue boat along for you next week Or a helicopter in a couple of hours What we require now from the Department is not only to take on the very sensible and acute recommendations of this committee but we need to emphasise the urgency I have a young farmer here this morning who is faced with a dilemma Does he sell some land or does he attempt to persuade his bank manager to give him an increased loan, I mean just to keep his business  afloat And he 's a young man in his twenties", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3cceabdb-43ca-4319-82f6-34e9ef2d03fd", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.285001+00:00"}
{"text": "<Multi-party talks 1>\n\n\n<$A> Mr Chairman in rising to support uh my party 's motion before the Forum uh today I 'd particularly like to concentrate on the section uh of that motion which condemns the continuing IRA terrorist outrages, and calls upon all parties to ensure that there be no participation in the talks, by uh parties, and a party  in particular which continues to promote any illegal organisation, perpetrating such outrages or which fails to totally commit itself to exclusively peaceful means This point is particularly uh dealt with, in our party 's paper on addressing decommissioning of the thirtieth of September this year And it 's certainly a point where I have little argument with the points advanced by the leader of the UK Unionist Party Mr McCartney And I 'd refer in particular to Section Five of our document,  Sinn Fe/in IRA must completely and unequivocally end its terrorist campaign  This will require more than a mere restoration of the ambivalent nineteen ninety-four ceasefire for there can now be no question of their entry to the process on the basis of that fraudulent ceasefire or any other ambiguous formula The credibility of any ceasefire will largely depend on whether the actions of the paramilitaries concerned are consistent with an ending of terrorism for good The continuation of paramilitary recruitment, training, targeting and social or economic terrorism would be incompatible with a genuine ending of the terrorist campaign I am glad Mr Chairman, that Mr McCartney, in his six principles, accepts that position put forward by our party on Monday\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> Sinn Fe/in IRA cannot enter\n<$B> Would Mr Hunter give way just for one moment\n<$A> One moment, They cannot enter the talks until such time as we have in the words of the Labour leader at his conference Mr Blair, and Sir John Wheeler Security Minister last night, an unequivocal ceasefire A ceasefire of nineteen ninety-four type, perhaps as advanced by Mo Mowlam the Labour spokesperson, is not acceptable We must have an unequivocal ceasefire,   Only  when that point comes in, can there be any possibility of looking, to see whether or not Sinn Fe/in can in fact then enter the process That remains the consistent position of the Ulster Unionist Party\n<$B>  Would you give way  \n<$B> Would you, would you give way On one point, The words, \" complete \", and \" permanent \" are quite different There is no mention in the Ulster Unionist document of a permanent ceasefire When you stop your car at traffic lights you come to a complete stop but it 's not a permanent one\n<$A> Mr Chairman it is a complete and unequivocal end to the terrorist campaign All due respect to my friend but it amounts to the same thing It is an end Now Mr Chairman there are two particular parties, that are holding up the advance of the Peace Process The government of the Irish Free State, and the Social Democratic and Labour Party\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> Those remain the two essential problems Our party has sat down with the two governments to discuss aspects of decommissioning We have no regrets for doing that But it 's quite clear that the Irish Government are not interested in pushing forward and advancing peace in Northern Ireland If they were to take a more positive attitude along with the minority population the SDLP who might even help by coming here, the the men from Martini who 'll talk to anyone anyplace anytime anywhere Why don't they come along here and discuss the future of our country with their fellow countrymen They 're afraid of that sort of debate But make no mistake about it Mr Chairman our party remains committed to the process we have set out in our document addressing decommissioning There will be no progress until such time as the governments deal properly with the legislation and again until those conditions of entry for Sinn Fe/in IRA are uh  accepted, uh both on our terms and indeed then reflected by the views of Mr McCartney And we certainly are glad to see that other parties in this aspect are supporting the policy of our party   That 's important  Thank-you Mr Chairman\n<$X>  Hear-hear  \n<$C> Thank-you Mr Hunter You you have been commendably brief and thank-you for it Mrs Iris Robinson <$D> Thank-you Mr Chairman Uh I 'll try not to be repetitive However, there are some points that can sensibly uh be repeated in order that the government, who have managed to ignore the majority 's views on most matters over those years know that we still hold firm to the fundamental principles surrounding the entry of Sinn Fe/in IRA to the talks process Mr Chairman if it was left to me there would be no entry, under any circumstances to negotiations for Sinn Fe/in IRA Those who are tethered to terrorism should not be allowed to pollute politics They should not be rewarded for stopping their murder campaign Sinn Fe/in IRA are using the political process as an extension of their so-called armed struggle This Provo leopard will never change its spots, I am glad that the leadership of my party were not conned by their ceasefire Other Unionists told us that we should give Gerry Adams the benefit of the doubt I would rather give him the benefit of permanent incarceration Another Unionist told the world that he had a feeling in his guts, that the IRA ceasefire was for real He should not have confused temporary IRA inactivity with his indigestion This community is already cursing the day that the government elevated terrorists to the role of political agenda-setters\n<$X> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$D> The idea that the future of this Province should be decided by thugs and gunmen fills me in roughly equal proportions with disgust and horror, The Government have forgotten the vile and heinous crimes these people have committed Even when sharply reminded by the IRA in London and Manchester they soon let the deed fade from their minds They the government attempted to justify their surrender to terrorism , terrorism by telling us that the  paramilitary parties would only gain entry on the foot of an absolutely permanent ceasefire They must hand over their illegal weapons, we were told But as the months and years pass by this Government have watered these conditions down until they now will welcome the IRA to talks complete with their deadly arsenal What confidence Mr Chairman could the decent people of this country have in such a rotten and iniquitous government What I find even more nauseating is the way that politicians of principle, who hold to proper democratic values are portrayed as the villains Those who insist that terrorists should give up their guns are described as wreckers and dishonourable Now the government want to promote legislation to destroy evidence from any weapon that is to be decommissioned The next step no doubt Mr Chairman will be to prevent the RUC from, from  pursuing inquiries into the many unsolved murders in our society In other words close the files, and I suspect Mr Chairman that may be the case already Mr Chairman, after three thousand deaths, tens of thousands of people maimed and injured, and billions of pounds of damage to the economy, I am not willing to grovel at the feet of Gerry Adams\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$D> Even if I have to look on at the pathetic , the pathetic spectacle of Her Majesty 's Government bowing and scraping before him If the IRA thought that the Unionist community were as weak and wobbly, pliable and puny, faint and feeble, as some of those who claim to represent them, then I hope the lesson of Drumcree has not been lost on them, The Unionist people Mr Chairman have had enough, and God help the one who tries to push them any further\n<$C> Thank-you Mrs Robinson, Mr David Brewster\n<$E> Thank-you Chairman, I 've listened to this debate with great interest and it 's certainly been a wide-ranging debate, from the broad European approach from my friend Professor Alcock to Mr Paisley 's uh gambit for Unionist unity Now, Chairman, I think we all agree that we 're not happy with the rate of progress date And whilst we are encouraged that there 's still been some progress we would all like it to have been more Nevertheless there has been some considerable movement, uh from where we were in June, and I 'm sure Chairman you recall as I do uh in June there were rows about the appointment of the chairman, and at that particular uh time I recall that both the Democratic Unionist and the UK Unionist parties came out of uh Stormont Castle and were very negative about the position of the appointment of the chairman Yet the following week they were back in the talks, they were accepting the jurisdiction and the chairmanship of Mr Mitchell And on that point as with so many others it appears that our party has been proved right\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$E> And Chairman, from that point there has definitely been a coming together and a development of some limited progress, certainly between the Unionist parties And I 'm quite happy in the light of a very thoughtful and constructive speech today from Mr McCartney to say that in particular I feel that there 's a great deal in common between his party and ours\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$E> And I have to quail before his justly famous vituperation when I say that that was not always the case Perhaps even in June when he came out on the steps of Stormont Castle and was somewhat uhm disappointed shall we say with our  uh party 's position Well at that occasion Chairman I have to say that uh unfortunately and ungraciously I kept thinking of a brief line from Gilbert and Sullivan and I do apologise to him because clearly this is no longer the case But I couldn't help thinking of that couplet,  I grew so rich that I was sent, from a pocket borough into Parliament, I always voted at my party 's call, and I never thought of thinking for myself at all, I thought so little they rewarded me,  by making me a member of the DUP,  Fortunately Chairman\n<$B> You must have worked overnight on that one\n<$E> I did I did\n<$F> Don't give up the day job\n<$E> Fortunately Chairman I 'll sing it if you want\n<$C> Next time, next time we 'll have to get you to sing Mr Brewster <$E> Fortunately Chairman Mr McCartney has seen sense and his very sensible six points today do insofar as they come along with the Unionist Party 's proposals\n<$B> You 've come along with them since they were printed before you produced your document \n<$E> That 's interesting, That 's interesting, I 've I 've only seen them today Chairman and uh certainly insofar as they uh go down the road we want to go they 're not bad But there are some things where perhaps we could see improvement The first thing I see that he seeks a declaration by Sinn Fe/in IRA of a complete and permanent ceasefire Now Chairman it 's already been alluded to by my friend, Mr Hunter, that we have asked for that, and more than that, we have said that words are not enough The ceasefire credibly depends on whether their actions are consistent, and we are entitled as a party and we will make a judgement on whether any Sinn Fe/in or any other party 's actions are consistent with their words, His second point, subscription by both Sinn Fe/in and IRA to the Mitchell principles We have also stated that there must quote,  be a solemn commitment to the principles in Mitchell on disarmament and decommissioning  And in case there 's any doubt this party does not and will never accept that there is a distinction between Sinn Fe/in and the IRA\n<$B> Hear-hear\n<$E> Thirdly, he says a declaration by the two governments that Sinn Fe/in 's entry into the talks at any stage must be preceded by the declaration of a complete and permanent ceasefire And indeed, insofar as a government 's declaration is worth anything that would certainly assist But governments ' declarations don't hold a great deal of weight in this country",

{"text": "<Water supply>\n\n\n<$A> Would the honourable gentleman give way on this point\n<$B> Yes I will\n<$A> Uh does he not uh agree that the uh Government who seem to be so keen on doing this even without consultation have been putting these points over and over again and putting in some people 's view a one-sided view of the advantage of this to children And uh all we have heard from the Government is a one-sided view of the so-called medical evidence And that has been put and put and put again, whereas those that have been opposing it haven't had the same opportunity to put the other side And therefore I think this report wants a thorough discussion of the whole matter And where best to discuss it but at the local government level where you 're nearer to the people and you have the representatives of the people\n<$B> I would accept entirely what the Member has said I I have said that in uh attempting to establish this Commission we want to examine the evidence for and against We want to see it set out clearly side by side so that we can come to an objective decision And that is exactly what the Honourable Member has said and which, I agree with him, has not been done There has not been equitable consultation and that is exactly what we want to see What I don't want to see us doing is going up to speak to a Minister and have the usual exercise  nice to see you to see you nice Goodbye  We don't want that We want to put forward to him a specific proposal on which we will request him to act to ensure that what we are asking for is done An equitable form of consultation Now we 'll draw attention to the summary of the key recommendations that we have put forward in eight one to eight five We believe that if this is done, the decision that we arrive at will be fairly done on the basis of equitable consultation and not in fact on the basis of a motion Thank-you Mr Chairman\n<$C> Thank-you Mr Curran Mr Sam Gardiner\n<$D> Thank-you Mr Chairman May I start by paying tribute to Mr Smyth for his able and wise leadership of the committee, to Mr Arnold, secretariat and his support, for their dedicated work in the overcoming of many obstacles\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$D> I was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to chair a number of the meetings that dealt with this contentious subject, both  taking sessions and deliberative sessions So I know only too well the strength and feelings on the subject, and the emotions it can stir up Like the Chairman I too was greatly impressed with those who came to testify and it was during this course of oral sessions that my personal views on the subject underwent a change I commend this report to the Forum for its even-handedness and fairness It is a totally balanced piece of work and it is the produce of some hours of agonising for all of us It represents a compromise because as chairman at some of these sessions I can tell you that there was much give and take And it, and it is that what makes the report a document that could be subscribed to It is true that everyone did not get everything they wanted but that is the nature of such things The report does set out, to, uh not to criticise That was not our function Instead we record facts as we saw them If that, if if that appears to some as unduly critical so be it But the tenor of the report is really and truly quite mild Our  recommendations are unanimous No-one to my knowledge  disagreed with our conclusions There are some, it is true, who have wished that the committee had gone further But there 's only so much you can do to take on board before the boat begins to take in water and we felt that we had reached that point The whole problem as we see it stems from the statutory arrangements and the central focus of the report in this area We feel that the present system has starkly highlighted a democratic decifit , deficit, at  at least this must be so if heed is not taken to our recommendations Chief among these is the need to take on board,  chief among these is the need to take on board in full measure the views of public representatives, and in this case the local authorities Today I make a plead for unity and full-hearted support of this motion from the Forum so that the weight may be added to the sterling efforts of the committee and those who served it That is the tone I   would like to see , I would like to   see set \n<$E>  Would Mr Gardiner give way  \n<$E>  Would Mr Gardiner give way  \n<$D> Yes I do\n<$E> Mr Gardiner it 's just to give you the opportunity to come back I I felt rather insulted, and I 'm sure he didn't mean it that way by the Labour 's uh representative Mr Curran when he stated that his representative Dr Alan Evans wasn't given an opportunity Would you Mr Mr Gardiner agreeing with me some of the meetings that you chaired and certainly those that I chaired that everyone, but everyone, be they voting members or not were given equal opportunity to present their case And would you also Mr Gardiner confirm with me that at no time and in fact I went to great lengths to spell it out, at no time but no time did we ever criticise any board or in fact any person who came to us be they for or against Would you so confirm\n<$D> Yes Mr Chairman I would agree with those sentiments of Mr Smyth and I 'm sure that colleagues that served on the Health Committee would endorse what he has also said Today I make the plea for unity and full-hearted support of this motion from the Forum so that weight may be added to the sterling efforts of the committee and those who served it and I think that answers uh Mr Smyth and and uh,  it 's a message also to Mr Curran, that uh uh I should, I should just add that the Health and Social Services Councils fully oppose fluoridation and these bodies set up to advise the public also need to be taken seriously I know Mr Chairman it is the mind of the Ulster Unionist party that mass medication should not be added to the water, and the people of Northern Ireland be giving a free choice\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$D> I commend this report to the Forum and I have great uh pleasure in supporting the motion moved by our chairman of the Health Committee Mr Smyth\n<$C> Thank-you Mr, thank-you Mr Gardiner Mr Gregory Campbell\n<$F> Thank-you Mr Chairman Could I join in the tribute paid to the uh chairman of the Health Committee Mr Hugh Smyth and to the secretary Mr Denis Arnold for the uh diligent work that was undertaken to produce this report Uh just to put it in its proper context uh Mr Chairman the issue of the uh possible fluoridation of the water supply came at the very end of the Minister 's consultative uh process Therefore time was running against the committee from the very inception of the project uh and I want to concur with uh both the chairman 's interjection as well as Mr Gardiner 's comments that uh in all the time that I was on the committee at no time did I perceive or see or hear from any Member that there was a a feeling that their views had been overlooked or had not been taken fully into account Uh in fact uh at the last meeting we had uh yesterday I think I made that very point, that any views that people had in terms of reservations uh had been fully aired and could be aired on the floor of the Forum today And I think that was uh adhered to by all members Mr Chairman the committee faced uh a most difficult task because the facts of the matter are that the, North, that Northern Ireland 's dental health is very poor That is a fact that I think is uh admitted by everyone in this debate It is about the only thing that everybody does agree on in this debate but they agree on that But surprisingly enough, the dental health of particularly children, uh and that is what the the fluoride debate is aimed at at the  dental health of of young people, but surprisingly enough the dental health of children in Northern Ireland, while it is poor, it is not as poor as the dental health of children in some fluoridated areas So even there we get into a dispute about whether or not fluoride uh leads uh unequivocally to better dental health That was one of the the issues that we were faced with The fundamental thing Mr Chairman was that we as a committee, uh first of all we received unsolicited uh evidence from those who were opposed to fluoride uh then after opening it up and going, such was our  endeavours to try and ensure that we did cover uh uh the issue from either side that we  we opened it up to those who were in favour of fluoride, despite the fact that we didn't have to We had advertised, and we had received evidence and uh submissions from those who were against, but we asked those who were in favour to come forward and then they did Having done that we were then faced with a very difficult task in that we were given evidence of an extremely strong nature against fluoride  on one part of the day and on the same part of that day later on we were given evidence of a very strong nature that was in favour of fluoride So the committee was faced with uh an onerous task of trying to determine uh what would be the best way to establish whether or not this uh Health Committee would join with all of the Health Councils in Northern Ireland who are the uh uh the consumer watchdog in favour uh of uh better representation by the public in terms of uh of the delivery of health services and twenty-five of the District Councils and vote against fluoride or not That was the the task that we were faced with We uh, uh in receiving the evidence on either side, uh those who were in favour of fluoridation really uh  when you boil it down they,  their views revolved around this factor that fluoride in the public water supply will improve the dental health of children They they say it will improve the dental health of everyone but basically the problem lies uh with young people Those who were opposed to fluoridation said that there are mixed views, that the evidence is at best mixed uh in terms of proving that And that there was very strong uh indications uh that said that the suppression of immune defences would result from fluoridation of the water supply, that mottling of teeth would occur and that the brittling of bones would occur uh uh to a greater degree uh in fluoridated water So again the uh, the the the disparity that existed between the two sections of evidence became more pronounced For me and I know for virtually everyone on the committee the issue then transcended that of public health of young children in our society It then became uh uh an issue for most of us I think in fact for virtually all of the committee which was do we accept that there will be a project that will affect virtually every man woman and child in Northern Ireland, beyond which no person will be able to opt out of, because all of us in some way or other are affected by that which comes through the public water supply", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "58cf8a53-85e6-4b3c-99c5-3e3aebd285c4", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.287089+00:00"}
{"text": "<Multi-party talks 2>\n\n\n<$A> Mr Chairman, I rise to uh support our party 's amendment and I also would like to say Mr Chairman I not like many other people I don't believe that we have peace I believe we 're still in a state of war We 're not fighting the IRA or the  Protestant paramilitaries are not using their weapons the way that they used to use them but they 're using other techniques which is still going on in our province And in the area that I represent there 's still many people beat up and uh or persecuted because they don't toe the line And we all know that within the two political parties the uhm the PUP and the UDP there 's still not unity amongst them in their ranks and we know that there 's hard feelings against their leaders and what they 're trying to achieve here and that 's why we have the the the heaval amongst them today because many of them believe that they 're going down the the the wrong road Now I believe in democracy Unfortunately, uh Mr Chairman as we all uh uh did not agree to this form of election that the British Government have apposed upon us, we had no other or way to get out of it only fight this election on the uh the way the British Government allowed us to Unfortunately, I  I mean I must rebuke Hugh Smyth He keeps telling us that he topped the poll He didn't top the poll at all He only got one thousand nine hundred votes Now you had you had to be about on the ground that day because if you had to go out on the Shankill Road the two paramilitary wings you had that many people on the ground uh nobody could else could move, and yet they did not achieve the vote they 'd expected When I seen them I said, I said to the my workers, boy well they 'll have about four thousand votes the two The whole five of them, all my five workers I 'm not, I 'm being honest about it My five workers And uh and all that the team that they had And the big fancy cars and vans and so on I don't know where they got the money from like But, let me say this, and yet they did not achieve what they want The Democratic Unionist Party came second with seventeen hundred votes Pretty good, comparing it with only a small number of people out working and couldn't get all the people that we want The Ulster Unionists got fourteen hundred The big UDA we all talk about only got eight hundred votes, with all their fancy  fancy posters and so forth\n<$B> Will the speaker give way\n<$A> No I 'm not giving way\n<$C> Are, are we getting to the point\n<$A> I never I never interrupted anybody all day  I was a very good a very good wee boy   and  listened to everybody   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$C>  Yes   <$C>  Mr, Mr, Mr Smyth, the,   Mr Smyth the election was on the thirtieth of May Today is the fourth of October Could we stick   to today  <$A>  We 're told   we 're told Chairman that the Shankill is the heartline of the paramilitary   stronghold  That is nonsense as it 's been said, because the vote shows it, that over three thousand three hundred voted for the democratic parties and only two thousand seven hundred   voted  for these other people\n<$X>  Nonsense  \n<$X>  What about Gerry Adams  \n<$A> Well I 'm not worrying Gerry uh Gerry Adams Gerry Adams is, you know where I stand where Gerry Adams is concerned Well let me tell you Chairman Let us be honest I have been under the boot to these fellas There 's a man sitting there behind me there, had to come to my house and protest That 's the type of democratic voting he talked about And I laugh when I see some of them on the TV who I helped to get bungalows and houses and some of them when they were arrested in jail were glad of my reference to help them get them out And some of them even, some of them even sent some of them even sent for me to bail them out bail them out But what they but them people tell me they were under threat They were told they had to be there But listen, Chairman, they 've no consent about uh uh uh my wife and my, my little, my two handicapped children which them thugs were outside my house spitting and kicking my door at that day Well that 's the type of thing we 're talking about Well we must give these people the <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> IRA Now the people of Northern Ireland have spoken The British Government made this election to suit these people They were up in Stormont for months beforehand uh talking uh, to anything They were making deals And what happened was that the British Government didn't come across with the deal and the poor men behind the bars today are the ones that suffered and are suffering because the deals did not come across\n<$X> Nonsense\n<$A> And so therefore these people have let them down because they 've looked after themselves And let me tell you this uh Mr Chairman, that people, I shouldn't even be here today\n<$X> That 's true\n<$A> Because democratically th' election is not right The people   be here is the people who got the vote and passed the the the quota and should be elected in here Now in saying that, I would 've been here if I had 've stood in North Belfast where I should 've stooden But, but I decided\n<$C> Mr Smyth this is most entertaining but it 's it 's getting it 's getting a little far away from from the uh from supporting your party 's motion which   we 're coming very close to  <$A>  Can I say this   Can I say this That the people of Northern Ireland have spoken They have said, and we 're the only party have made it very clear that we 're, were at war for decommission, made it very clear to the voters in my area in which I stand up and stood at that election and our people voted according to their conscience and the people say, we want the guns off the streets and we want a democratic politics to work in Northern Ireland, and that 's what the people have said in this election But unfortunately, unfortunately the British Government and the E/ire Government and other people who who tell the people one thing and then change their mind and do another, they are the ones, they are the ones who are going to bring this process to a  a a halt, not us For we have made it clear where we stand Now I believe when peace will come, in righteousness and truth\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> I believe, peace will come when men confess I know men who 're doing time today because they were converted and came to Christ and gave themselves up because of the crime that they have, uh have committed And you 're going to tell me as our, some of our colleagues have mentioned of policemen and Army people today who are standing with are  are with no arms, no legs, part of their bodies blown up, shot and so forth and them people are saying, oh keep your guns We want peace on them terms And everybody knows we remember it during the War and I wasn't there I wasn't even born probably But I remember reading and we were told that the Prime Minister come with a bit of paper,  Germany will not attack , And they did attack And what we 're saying is the   Labour Party telling us that, oh we 'll give these people their way and there 'll be peace, For how long Chairman Another ten fifteen years Then our children and our grandchildren will see the same thing that we have suffered for twenty-six year in this province because we have a weak government who will not deal with the men of violence and put them out of the systems and out of the road and let the true good honest  Ulster people live in peace both Roman Catholic and  who wants to live and get on with  their lives in this province Now the Labour Party said earlier\n<$X> Does that does that include the Labour Party\n<$A> The Labour Party said earlier that <unclear> several sylls </unclear> But he must be to blame <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> he 's a lot older than me He 's one of the causes then that he has created in this province for the like of me who knew nothing about it til I was born and reared into the Province, of the the the Troubles of this country But the  the trouble of this country has not been made by us It 's been made by those who are enemies against the British way of life in this land and so there Mr Chairman we cannot allow\n<$D> That 's a very sweeping statement\n<$C> Are you giving way to Mr Casey\n<$D> Seeing as this is being recorded I 'd like to know what I 've done that I 'm the cause of all this \n<$C> Read the rules and see that when the Chairman is standing everybody sits down Sit down\n<$?> Sit down\n<$C> And sit down Mr Smyth too It 's that kind of scene which I 'm not going to live with As long as I 'm Chairman and I 'm only Chairman here as long as seventy-five percent of you don't vote me out, I will not have that kind of altercation taking place You have one more minute Mr Smyth\n<$A> Thank-you Chairman\n<$X> Sit down \n<$C> Right Mr Smyth You 've one more minute\n<$A> Mr Chairman uh uh could I explain myself Sorry Chairman I want to explain myself\n<$C> One more minute that 's all\n<$A> What I what I meant was his generation before my generation herited and passed it on That 's what I am saying And he didn't deal with it in his day so he needn't accuse our generation today when their generation didn't deal with it either That 's what we 're saying Mr   Chairman  let me say this The people that I represent, have made it very clear to me and I live on the Shankill and I walk up and down it and I meet all sorts of people, from Ulster Unionists, from the  paramilitaries, and I may not agree with them but I 've some good friends and I respect them and they tell me that they don't want to go back to them days and they 're prepared to give up their weapons if their leadership would only lead them and say, we 're giving them up and we 're going to go in to democratic politics and do what the people want It 's about time that the politicians listened to their people And that 's what we did at our party We 're here representing the views of the people and we will not change our minds but we believe that the guns must go for the future of our country\n<$X>  Thank-you very much  \n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$C> Mr Peter Robinson what I 'm now going to do is to call the three last speakers, who will be who from the Alliance <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>, Mr Robinson, Lord Alderdice and Mr uh Mr Taylor to make the final speeches and then we 'll go to voting on a motion which will require a sixty-six percent vote, uh and will be uh in terms of Rule thirteen-one, the famous Rule thirteen-one Mr Robinson\n<$E> On a point of order sir are you calling both amendments\n<$C> Yes\n<$E> Thank-you\n<$F> Mr Chairman uh I was uh only a a young lad of seventeen when what is euphemistically described as the Troubles began uh in Northern Ireland Uh indeed uh I can recall uh that I had a lot more interest in a a young girl who was only a few months younger than me than I had   in politics Uh I had uh no interest in politics at all uh until a young friend of mine was killed by the Provisional IRA, and it was that action which jolted me uh towards politics and provided the incentive uh and the reason why I entered the political process Uh I grew up in an area where the Provisional IRA almost on a a weekly basis uh would come in, leave a car bomb outside somebody 's home uh, or go in and shoot someone until eventually people in that area uh like uh areas throughout Belfast as a whole, but the Province in general uh used to put vigilantes out on the streets to protect their own areas Uh along with many others uh I stood and uh gave up my sleep to stand on the barricades with the vigilantes in my area to stop IRA incursions uh into the district And eventually those vigilantes uh became more organised informed and eventually became some of the paramilitary organisations that we have in our Province And many of the people uh who stood along with me at those barricades uh chose the path of going into paramilitary organisations So I come from a background which understands how many people entered into those Loyalist paramilitary organisations, and I can recognise all too clearly that if there had not been the violence of the Provisional IRA, or if on the other hand there had been proper and effective measures taken by our government, and not just the Conservative and Labour governments but even before that, the Ulster Unionist government at Stormont, if there had been those effective measures I don't believe we would have had the spectre of Loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL",

proceed to the Park to put Mr Whelehan beyond accountability to this House in the belief that the Labour ministers had merely dropped out to hear the latest from the count centre in Cork, Secondly can I ask you Taoiseach, if you were satisfied that the Minister for Justice was unaware of the existence of these warrants, is it not the case that matters of far less serious import than a child abuser at loose in this jurisdiction would have been drawn to the personal attention of the Minister for Justice and that in this case this information was brought to her desk And finally Taoiseach can I ask you to answer the question that the people uh of Ireland want to know, which is why you would put your government at risk and your own reputation and future as Taoiseach for the purposes of making Mr Whelehan President of the High Court And can I ask you if you can recall with me the intervention of the then Attorney General to direct his Senior Counsel to intervene when you were being questioned on the motivation for your decisions as Minister for Industry and Commerce before the Beef Tribunal and that as a result of his intervention the  the doctrine of Cabinet confidentiality was given rise to which had the effect of saving your political neck, and that the reason, that the reason that you have appointed Mr Harry Whelehan President of the High Court is to repay that debt despite his lamentable performance  despite his lamentable performance\n<$B> He should be very careful about such innuendo Such innuendo should not be, should not happen in this House <&Irish> An </&Irish>

was carried out by one Justice Liam Hamilton and I 'll leave his report intact Uh in relation to this uh colourful mad rush to the Park if, Deputy Rabbitte and I I I I don't know you must have been out because otherwise I explained in detail to Deputy Mitchell who raised that particular problem or raised that particular aspect of this case I have said and I, repeat that uh there was no mad rush to the Park as you would suggest in relation to it, that uh the the Secretary of the Government was asked after the Cabinet meeting to make the appropriate uh arrangements for it uh as I say other uhm diaries of of commitments already given had to be taken into consideration and I 'm sure the deputy will appreciate that, that uh Saturday was not suitable uh for <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> reasons, Saturday was not suitable There was no mad rush to the Park The the Government 's Secretary made the appropriate arrangements and we had to comply and indeed make availability, make our availability indeed to dovetail with somebody else 's in  in relation to their particulars I want to  I want to put it on the record that at no time, and I want to say this  unequivocally at no time did I discuss whatever Deputy Rabbitte is trying to infer here I don't know, in relation to somehow uh the former Attorney General involving himself some way or another which I know nothing about and if if Deputy Rabbitte wants to substantiate that I 'll be glad to have it investigated for him\n<$B> Deputy Bobby Molloy \n<$C> Sorry <&Irish> A </&Irish> Leas-Cheann Comhairle I have part of an answer I still have another part of an answer in relation to Deputy Rabbitte and that is the  the whole question again of the role of the Department of Justice The impression created by today 's media reporting of the role of the Department of Justice in the Smyth extradition case is misleading in that it proceeds on the false assumption that the Department of Justice was in possession of certain essential information The factual position does not say so As is normal practice in extradition cases, a copy of the warrants in the Smyth case was sent  If I, If I, If I am asked here, I 'm not regulating the questions here If I 'm asked a question, Deputy, Deputy Rabbitte has the same right to get a reply as everybody else, as everybody else, the same right, However \n<$B> Too many interruptions from either side of the House please\n<$C> However, however the  however the information  the information contained in the warrant stated the name of the person sought but without any reference to his

Persons Act of eighteen sixty-one, indecent assault, against a male, and in one case, a female \n<$A> I have a statement in a half, for a half an hour\n<$C> I know I put a statement on the record If,

responsible for maladministration in his office That 's one question Uhm in view of the fact that uh for  some months prior to the President of the High Court being appointed the Taoiseach was well aware uh of the strong opposition of uh his colleagues in the partnership government Labour Party Why then did he persist in proceeding uhm with that appointment And also finally could he tell the House uh how he could possibly come to the conclusion that the Labour Party were merely absenting themselves from the Government meeting merely to uhm register their non-participation uh in the decision uh to appoint Harry Whelehan uh as the Attorney General uh when they obviously remained out for the remainder uh of that uh Government meeting Uh  the explanation given Taoiseach in your statement to the House so far is not plausible that you could possibly have come to that decision\n<$B> <&Irish> An </&Irish> Taoiseach\n<$C> Well the indeed uh the explanation as to what went wrong in the system is it may, it 's not plausible it 's not acceptable and I agree with Deputy Molloy in that regard Uh as uh the question of responsibility I dealt with that very clearly I dealt with responsibility I dealt with accountability and I dealt with culpability Here today in my statement, here today in relation to many questions as well The  responsibility I quoted W T Cosgrave and somebody questioned questioned that here  responsibility, the responsibility\n<$F> <unclear> several words </unclear> to the questions I put Not the Taoiseach <unclear> several sylls </unclear> written down on the one page <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$C> Don't worry about that\n<$B> Three minutes and I want to accommodate the final Deputy\n<$C> The  the responsibility, if people if people don't accept what was there and I accept what Deputy McDowell said but the Constitution hasn't been changed in that regard from an earlier supplementary that he asked, uh the responsibility clearly lies with the government as a whole in relation to what W T Cosgrave has said, that the President of the Executive Council nineteen twenty-four stated given the necessity to have someone to answer for the Attorney General in this House where he was not a member and I quote,  in this arrangement the Executive Council has the general responsibility and must be prepared to answer for the Attorney , for the\n<$F> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$B> Deputy McDowell please\n<$C> It is, it is laid down where the responsibility lies by the very first uh post-independent Irish Government at the time of the Ministers and Secretaries Act And I \n<$F> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$C> I might add I might add I might add if I was allowed, I might add if I was allowed, that that is seventy years ago, and I think that this House would agree with me, would agree with me, that as part of the strategic management initiative which I 'm undertaking, please, with regard to the strategic management initiative that I have taken, that it is time to look, and it 's in everybody 's interest in this House, it is time to look at the nineteen twenty-four Ministers and Secretaries Act again Not alone, not alone from a government 's point of view but, but indeed in relation to Secretaries of Departments who are finding themselves in invidious positions regarding decisions taken down the line I think this is an issue that this Da/il could indeed address and address itself quite profitably in that regard because if my colleague sitting beside me, if my colleague sitting beside me Deputy Bertie Ahern has a hundred, as Minister for the Public Service has a hundred and eighty-seven odd thousand uh employees under his direction, as, is this House seriously suggesting that any single member of a hundred and eighty-seven thousand who make a mistake that he indeed has to take full responsibility He he is responsible but he 's not  but he 's not

which he says,  in my opinion it follows that I personally and the Government as a whole must take some responsibility for the deficiencies in the  in the operation of extradition procedures in the AG 's office as brought to light in the Smyth case  means that he is saying that the Ta/naiste and the Labour Party should share in the guilt of the decision he made last Friday May I ask him in relation to page twenty of his speech, in which he says, my view of good government is that it must be decisive, is he contrasting this with the Labour Party 's insistence on accountability as indecision and isn't he isn't he in effect getting in his retaliation first so to speak And finally may I ask the Taoiseach, why is it that none of the seventeen or so existing High Court judges from whom every President of the High Court since nineteen twenty-four was chosen was not suitable for the job on this occasion\n<$B> <&Irish> An </&Irish> Taoiseach\n<$C> I 'm not getting into the latter part of

the full facts, unvarnished facts that 's what you 'll get, everything I have It was a very serious allegation by Deputy Rabbitte I was entitled to and indeed I 'm sure he he would want me to and members of the House wanted me as well, to go into it in depth, and that 's what I 'm doing It is not my fault that uh one of the members of the staff is on his way from Macedonia and we know he 'll

Bruton raised that it related to the, statement made yesterday in the House by the Taoiseach when he said that he was assured that there was no outside interference, in the matter of the warrants for Brendan Smyth And the question related to whether or not there was indeed outside interference or representations And finally may I ask the Taoiseach if he accepts, that it is the former Attorney General and the Taoiseach who have to answer questions in this House, not Deputy Kenny and I\n<$A> Taoiseach\n<$F> Well, it 's very difficult to know where the Democratic Left is coming from I have Deputy de Rossa stand up and say that it 's useless to start this debate uh without the full facts I have Deputy Rabbitte sitting right beside him getting up and saying, after the Taoiseach makes his opening uh statement this evening can we have a <&Irish> sos </&Irish> So if you could sort out between yourselves what you really want I will try and facilitate you I will try and facilitate you In relation, in relation to questions in this House I stand over my statement yesterday in relation to the the the questions raised by Deputy Kenny and yourself about outside influence or outside contacts, contacting either me, the  or the Attorney General or the person that handled the file, I was asked to widen it, into the whole areas of if files existed or if a letter was on a file and all that particular area and as I say it has progressed to the stage I 've already progressed We were quite happy to start this debate this morning if the House so wished in relation to Deputy Ahern and that I will come into the House with the full facts as I have assembled them whenever you 're ready So whichever you, whichever this House wants me to do I 'm open to do it\n<$X> It 's a stalling tactic\n<$F> It 's not a stalling tactic If the House makes up their mind we can start the debate now and I 'll come into it later on this evening or if you want me to go with the information available to me I will go in an hour 's time when the House wants to re-adjourn But I would suggest that the best thing you could do is let the Whips get on with their business and sort it out\n<$A>  Deputy John Bruton I will call <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$A> Deputy Bruton\n<$G> Well I I The reason the debate didn't start this morning was that the person who should have opened it, namely the Taoiseach, was unwilling or unable to do so  Unable to open it And unable for his own, out of his own failure to open it at the appropriate time Now at this stage we have a situation where six ministers apparently are not attending Cabinet meetings We don't have a government We don't have a government I understand at this time and I think it 's important,  I think it 's important, I think it 's important that this matter be cleared up quickly\n<$X> Do you want to say something Dick\n<$A> Deputy Shatter has an offering\n<$F> There was no I want just in response to Deputy Bruton, it 's not a question of being unable or unwilling, there was no Cabinet meeting today\n<$A> Deputy Alan Shatter\n<$H> Sir I I think it 's only fitting after the last question that I follow up and ask the Taoiseach a very, a very fundamental question that the entire country is looking into this House and wondering about And I think it 's time sir that both you and the Ta/naiste got off the fence and told this House, is the partnership government still in being or is part of the partnership semi-detached and heading off to the country I think we 're entitled to know that and we 're entitled to bring the farce that 's being enacted out in this House to an end at this stage \n<$A> Uhm may I, may I express the hope that when we, when we do adjourn that we shall be in a position to proceed with the business of the House today and I would advise the House to take sufficient time as will ensure that that is so How much time do we want\n<$E> Ceann Comhairle it 's my understanding that one hour will be sufficient\n<$A> Uhm perhaps a final question from Deputy de Rossa\n<$?> I didn't hear the statement Ceann Comhairle\n<$A> One hour Deputy is suggested   of  a recess\n<$X>  From now  \n<$A> Uhm that the House do, does reconvene in an hour 's time\n\n<$G> I rose here, about an hour ago and uh I haven't since uh found any further evidence of, in response to the queries raised here Uh I suppose like other places I too am getting getting phonecalls and saying would you check this and check that and I suppose that 's only to be expected in those set of circumstances But if any member of the House has any genuine information, and I don't mean wild allegations, because Deputy Rabbitte did say that what he was speaking about would rock the foundations of this State That 's a very very serious statement to make And I think it 's incumbent on all of us to produce any evidence we have and as I say again, I will not shirk my responsibility in trying to find out information for this House and for the general public\n<$X> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$G> I made a statement in this House yesterday regarding the circumstances of the appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan to the presidency of the High Court I also referred yesterday to my total commitment to public accountability and on that basis I make this further statement to the House, Not down yet\n<$?> He 'll be here in a few minutes\n<$A> Please now\n<$C> I just want to ask the Taoiseach is he going to start\n<$F> We 'll have a script for you in a few minutes\n<$?> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Let 's let 's have an orderly debate now Members will have an opportunity of intervening at the appropriate time\n<$C> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> really ask the Taoiseach if he would tell us is he going to circulate a speech\n<$G> Of course yes\n<$C> Thank-you\n<$G> Of course I 'm sorry it 's not down here I explained fully the circumstances of the case and I answered all questions fully and honestly on the basis of information then available to me In nominating the former Attorney General to this high judicial office I was honouring the precedents which had been established by successive governments since the foundation of this State In honouring this commitment, I was dealing with Mr Harry Whelehan on the same basis as I had dealt with people all my life, in business and in politics That is, my word is my bond Having made that commitment on the basis of long-standing precedents I felt duty bound to honour it The decision was made by the government on the assumption that the legal , the legal advice from the then chief law officer of the State was the full detailed information available both in law and in fact, and was based on the fullest enquiries being made as I had initially directed When I appointed the new Attorney General Mr Fitzsimons, the Minister for Justice on my behalf, requested him to conduct a full and detailed investigation of the file in the Smyth case and to report back The investigation carried out has produced the information that the Smyth case was not the first which fell to be considered under these provisions of the nineteen eighty-seven Act At all times and in his report to the Government of last week the former Attorney General stated that the Smyth case was the first to be applied under the same provisions This was given as one of the reasons for the delay in processing the case The investigation of the new Attorney General Mr Fitzsimons has shown that in a nineteen ninety-two extradition case, namely Duggan, executed by the former Attorney General Mr Whelehan, the section fifty provisions were considered At all times my colleagues and I in government were told by Mr Whelehan, in whom we placed our total trust, that the Smyth case was the first in which those provisions of the nineteen eighty-seven act had to be addressed for the first time I would have expected that the most senior legal officer of the State would have known of the Duggan case of nineteen ninety-two, considering that he himself cleared the warrants for endorsement by the Garda Commissioner and would have made this information known to me and the Government This information was not made known to me and the Government by the former Attorney General Had my colleagues and I been aware of these facts last week we would not have proposed or supported the nomination of Harry Whelehan as President of the High Court  I If you want facts and truth, that 's what you 're getting I 'm informed that the former Attorney General had forgotten about the Duggan case when he prepared and approved the report sent to me I am informed that the official in the Attorney General 's office who was involved in the preparation of that report was similarly not conscious of the existence of the case when the report was prepared In fact the official who had dealt with the Duggan case did not remember it when requested to assist in the Attorney General 's investigation This file was turned up,  This file was turned up,  This file was turned up by another official who in the course of the investigation was putting together details of other extradition cases However I would also have to say that in my view the report was seriously misleading to the House", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Government 2>\n\n\n<$A> In relation to uh what Deputy Kenny said no we haven't made any trace uh in relation to that particular area either The position about the staff, all the staff that are available uh in the country for the Attorney General 's office have now been interviewed in relation to it and each and every one of them uh has indeed said that uh that they have no knowledge whatsoever There are, there were three up to a half an hour ago there 's uh two uh left One will be arriving in Frankfurt at six twenty-five, will be on the ground in Frankfurt about six twenty-five uh and the other person is on uh holiday in the west coast of America and the chances of being able to track that person down although we have been on to uh uh a brother and sister that live in Dublin That 's our best effort so far and I have to say that that uh up to now uh that there has been no threat and no member of the staff that has been interviewed can indeed assist in this regard and they say that nothing like that exists or they have no knowledge of it Uh there also I understand has been a statement uh a public statement by the Cardinal to say that uh no such uh letter was ever sent Uh but we will continue to uh inquire from everybody uh the last two remaining people and uh If I believe now that the that the agreement of the House is that we proceed or hopefully proceed with uh the debate at five o'clock and if I have any more up-to-date information by five o'clock I will give you that uh but if I haven't I haven't and uh that 's a matter for the House Here this morning, here this morning I was asked, I was told not to come back without having  or being in a position to give full details to the House I have to say that I don't have any uh more information than I had the last time I was here and I believed it was uh a strong wish of the House that I should give the full facts and I will give the full facts as I have them when I have them but uh I have to say that that is the position as I have it now\n<$B> But   I suggest  therefore that it is rather pointless for this House to resume at five five o'clock if one of the people the people that has to be interviewed will not be arriving in Frankfurt until six twenty-five So  therefore all of the facts will not presumably be available as you can locate them Uhm could could I ask in terms of uh the people that have been interviewed whether the person who the Taoiseach told us yesterday was the sole official dealing with the file, has that person been   interviewed as yet\n<$C>  Proinsias de Rossa  \n<$C>   Taoiseach  \n<$A>  All persons   in in the office including the person uh concerned have been interviewed\n<$D> Ceann Comhairle\n<$C> Uh can I call Deputy John Bruton\n<$E> Sorry I I 've no time <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$C> Very well Uh Deputy Mary Harney\n<$D> I 'd like to thank Deputy Bruton Uhm could I ask the Taoiseach if the former Attorney General has been spoken to today, and secondly could I ask the  the Taoiseach will there be any resignations from his government I notice the Minister for Justice is not here, is that significant\n<$A> Is any what significant\n<$D> Do you expect any resignations from your government\n<$C> Taoiseach\n<$A> Uh, no I don't, Uh in relation to uhm the former Attorney General uh provided the the information uh or, as far, I I 'll check that out precisely now as to when and what date that information was given and I 'll give it when I come back in at five o'clock\n<$D> Taoiseach was the former Attorney General\n<$A> Well that 's what I 'm saying I want to check that uh I mean it isn't very fair I want to be very careful about it I have to check was it on, from his his uh information that what 's in my speech yesterday came or was it from an official   I 'll make that I 'll make that clear to you at five o'clock \n<$D>  No but what I asked you Taoiseach was was he spoken to   Did you speak to the former Attorney General today,\n<$A> No\n<$D> Or did anybody speak on your behalf\n<$A> No not today no\n<$D> He hasn't been spoken to\n<$C> May I call Deputy John Bruton\n<$B> He says that the information has not been turned up in the Attorney General 's office Are any other departments being investigated at this point in time\n<$A> No, uh because I think the  the information given here uh was that the supposed uh information was in existence in files in the Attorney General 's office\n<$B> That 's not what was said here\n<$A> Well if you, I mean I 'll be quite open about this and I hope you could be as open If you could give me any steer, any direction, any help, I will go to whatever Department of State is supposed to be have anything here and I will disclose it in full facts in this House I 'm not in the business of covering up for anybody or hiding anything If you give me any help you have, I don't expect you to give me my, give your sources as Deputy Rabbitte rightly said, but put us in the right direction if you have, and if you haven't please withdraw it\n<$B> I would   expect that the Taoiseach would investigate  these circumstances with whatever department is involved in that case directly or indirectly\n<$C>  Order I want I I I 'm anxious to call Deputy John Bruton  \n<$A> Including the Department of Justice\n<$B> Including the Department of Justice\n<$C> Can I call Deputy John   Bruton \n<$E>  Sir   sir as you will recall and I 'm sure the Taoiseach will too that Fine Gael merely asked a routine query about whether all the officials dealing with the Smyth case uh were, had been spoken to to determine the veracity of the statement that no representations were made Now we made no allegations whatever and indeed we have no solid basis for any allegation and never have had We have simply asked the question, were the people asked Now what I would like to ask the Taoiseach now is, why is it that these people weren't asked these questions, which are normal enough questions anyway, why the Attorney General before he presented his report to the government, why were they we having to ask them all these questions at this stage\n<$A> Pardon\n<$C> Taoiseach\n<$A> That 's a different, that 's a different position as I understand it today and if that is the position then I can tell the House quite openly that only one official dealt with the Smyth case One None others But the  what the the the message given to my office by the Whip was a different it wasn't, it was a different uh well as I as I if if that information is wrong forget about it Only one official dealt with, the Smyth case, has been interviewed, and that 's it\n<$E> Well just to clarify it uh   we may  save time afterwards by clarifying it now The position is that Deputy Kenny last night simply in as is the case with anybody  pursuing an inquiry would try to look for proofs for any statements that are made, asking who was asked to verify whatever statements were made and this was one statement made in the Attorney General 's office That was all Uhm we were not satisfied that the Taoiseach 's answers last night were completely categorical, because he said he he would talk about things to his knowledge but he hadn't, gone any further than what was to his knowledge and Deputy Kenny 's query today at half past eleven was simply asking the Taoiseach to verify the thing further to go beyond his knowledge and state categorically that no representations had been made, that 's all It was simply pinning down what the Taoiseach was saying That was all we were doing uh and I think it 's a it 's an a normal legitimate matter for any Opposition to do we, you don't accept anything on face value from anybody in circumstances like this, it 's your job to look for the proof\n<$C>  Deputy John Bruton  \n<$D> Ceann Comhairle\n<$C> Yes can, let 's not forget the time factor mentioned Uh five o'clock was mentioned There 's been quite an erosion of of that time uh  an hour  an hour Deputy Mary Harney\n<$D> Ceann Comhairle, Ceann Comhairle I don't understand quite honestly what the Taoiseach has been at all day Could I ask the Taoiseach has he asked for the resignation of any member of the government\n<$C> Taoiseach\n<$A> I have not asked for any resignation of any member of the government\n<$C> Deputy de Rossa\n<$B> Could I could I just ask the Taoiseach if he would clarify why it is that he considers that it would be worthwhile to return here in an hour if he does not expect to have interviewed one of the staff concerned in the Attorney General 's office by six twenty-five and if he has not yet carried out any investigation for instance, for instance, in relation to the role that may have been played by the Department of Justice in this matter\n<$F> Ceann Comhairle just on a point of   information  for the House and for Deputy de Rossa the Whips met briefly as I said we were in session coming up to four o'clock and we agreed because I understood it was the consensus of the Whips opposite that they wanted this debate to start at five o'clock or in an hour 's time Uhm I outlined  two options to two of the Whips and I 'm not sure if Deputy Rabbitte was in at the time uh that that we would start almost immediately when we got the mechanics of this out of the way, that we would start almost immediately but because the Taoiseach hadn't the full information requested in the House earlier this morning that the Minister for Finance would lead on, and that the Taoiseach would come into the House when he had that information available but no later than ten o'clock tomorrow or half ten tomorrow morning to explain to the House whether or not he had the information sought That was that was one of the options uh and the other option that I put to the two Whips uh was that we would start uh we would adjourn because we haven't the information available, that we would adjourn until ten thirty tomorrow morning and we would start the formal confidence debate and I I I think the two Whips opposite can confirm that They were two options and I said if the opposition have a third option or another option let them put it forward When, I had to leave the room for approximately three or four minutes and when I came back in it was my clear understanding from what was said although it was a rushed conversation that the three Whips had agreed that the debate the confidence debate should start this evening and that the Taoiseach should come in to lead off on that debate and uh explain whatever information he had uh at, when he started and to make it quite clear uh what exactly he had now That 's my understanding If I 'm wrong somebody tell me\n<$C>  Minister of State  \n<$C> Order order Deputy Enda Kenny\n<$F> Somebody who was actually in the room when we made the\n<$C> Deputy Enda Kenny has been called, Deputy Enda Kenny\n<$G> Ceann Comhairle, uh first of all I want to say this This party is very anxious that there will be no disruption of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation uh developments which which is due to meet on Friday Now uh this is a motion of confidence in the government and it will be expected by everybody in the House here that the motion will be led off by the Taoiseach as leader of the government and the Whips were anxious uh that at the commencement of this motion of confidence that the lead-off speaker would be the Taoiseach As the uh Whips' meeting so has not absolutely concluded we would be uh we would be anxious that the debate would commence with the Taoiseach leading off We would be anxious to have uh a recess after his speech in order to assimilate the importance of it and if uh and when the three remaining people from the Attorney General 's office are interviewed and have been interviewed by the Taoiseach 's personnel we would be uh  we would facilitate uh the extra information if any that is available from those three people being given to the House here during the course of the debate, and I think that 's a matter that the Whips can organise uh subsequent to the adjournment here But as I said, we 're anxious that this matter would be cleared up finally before Friday 's meeting of the uh Forum for Peace and Reconciliation", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Budget 1>\n\n\n<$A> At the uh, <&Irish> a </&Irish> Cheann Comhairle at the outset uh I am honoured uh to probably be the last uh time that an Opposition spokesperson will ever reply to a formal budget debate like today Cos I think I can take it that after the events of the past fortnight and the succession of leaks this will the be the last time that we 'll go through this charade if budgets are going to be leaked in the way they 've been done in the past while Now I 'm glad to note that the, that the Government have uh pre-empted their decision to have a constitutional referendum on cabinet confidentiality cos there will be no need to do so if we are to continue on in this particular basis before a budget And whereas as my party leader said this morning probably in the past that we went to too great a lengths to protect every single aspect of budget day, I think that it would be necessary for people to point out that it is a serious matter when all of the budget is leaked in advance There are, and even as we sat here today, a Minister of State decided to issue a press release, despite, at eight minutes past four, meaning that the Minister was only on his feet for eight minutes, speaking about the budget and the various matters that are curtained contained therein Now the Ceann Comhairle did ask that at least members of the House would for the time of the budget not do this, so it is, this was released at four o-eight this evening by the  by a Minister of State and I take it that the Ceann Comhairle will take up to this particular matter in the very near future with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges I also think, I also would like to say is that I am a person who in many areas of life and when I can laugh at myself and I don't take myself too seriously all of the time, but there is a need, there is a need that when dealing with serious matters of state to treat them as such And we, cannot, we cannot allow a situation for a government no matter made up of three parties or only, any number of parties to go ahead and have the type of leakages that have occurred in the past while I would ask the Taoiseach whom I know would share my concerns in this particular regard, to take some action because say it was planned today in the budget that there was to be an increased bank levy, or any other major taxation changes, wouldn't it not, there would be a run on the financial markets and I think ministers those ministers who have recently joined the government should be conscious of that before they step out and start telling their programme managers and advisors as to what is in the budget This is being looked at from abroad and I will recall and I 'm sure that Ruairi, Deputy Quinn who is a student of history will recall that a British Chancellor of the Exchequer, when walking into the chamber to deliver his budget speech happened to mention some little aspect to a person who went off and told a journalist and arising from same the Chancellor of the Exchequer resigned that evening not that it made any difference at all to the financial markets but on a point of principle And I hope that this particular budget will be the last time that we 'll go ahead like this I would be open enough to say is that maybe the spending estimates in the budget could be discussed a long time in advance but we cannot have a situation that we have had for the past while And may I also say that one of the papers this morning said in giving all the details of the budget, that the Department of Finance was leaking like a sieve Now I want to say that to my certain knowledge that the public  public civil servants that are permanent in the Department of Finance or no other government department has been involved in the leaking of this budget at all\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> It is a slur, it is a slur on the public servants who 've served this State long and well but particularly on the Department of Finance which if I may say so go to the other extreme, of, they 'd hardly tell you what day tomorrow was if at all they could avoid it And I think it is a pity that that has been done and I hope that an opportunity will be taken to correct it When I was a student, a colleague of mine Deputy Power used to bring me in here to listen to the budget and I used to sit in that gallery up there and I went down to take the notes one day because I was an accountancy  student and uh an usher came along to tell me you can't even take the notes And that is how serious the change that has taken place, and I don't say this lightly, I don't say that we have to have everything covered up and I 'm all for  openness but in the matter of the budget I ask the Taoiseach not to proceed on this basis any more Now the Minister, that 's what I 'll say at the outset because I do regard it as serious and I, there are things in life I think I can be flippant about and be good-humoured about but this is not one of those matters and I 'm sure the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are, fully agree with me Now this budget has been the best heralded of any budget in in the history of the State It 's more or less as someone some one of the back benchers said uh on my side of the House when Deputy Quinn was talking about uh the twenty ten strategy he said something like about a space odyssey Well I 'd describe this budget as a little bit like the Star Trek TV uh programme where it comes to the great line  beam me up Scotty   Now this budget is more like is kind of beam me up Ruairi or beam us up Ruairi into a world of fantasy where nobody is going to pay bills either now or into the future And I think that if the lessons of the past are not learned by the politicians of today, then we 're all going to pay a heavy price I 'd like to think is that someone who as maybe good-humoured about certain aspects of my own affairs both political, private and otherwise, I think that I 'd like to think that I paid a heavy enough political price for many years ago warning about the dangers of a government or political parties going down the road from which we did, and it took us a long time to recover from it and I say it with the utmost sincerity and I know that certain members in the opposite side of the House agree with me even though they may not be in a position to do anything about it and that includes certain members of the government If we go back the road from whence we came we are making a fundamental mistake for which this generation of politicians will not be forgiven by, by anybody\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> Now I toyed with a number of options as to how I might open this my particular address on budget day nineteen ninety-five, and option one was that I could   reread into the record of the House the budget statements of the last couple of years by Deputies Bruton, de Rossa and Rabbitte and comparing their then proposals as against what has been offered here today by the Minister for Finance But I will spare the blushes of the Deputies opposite, not may I say out of any great generosity on my uh behalf, but what useful purpose would it serve One could argue that as a result of such an expose/ a certain amount of political embarrassment will accrue to the parties now forming the Rainbow Coalition However it has been decreed from the pinnacle of the high moral ground on Carrantuohill and as enunciated and imprimatured by the high priests of political correctness that it is only Fianna Fa/il who do political U-turns All other political parties make policy adjustments in the best interests of the country, and never in their own of course, that being the preserve of those uncouth muck-savages, unprincipled and power-hungry members of the Fianna Fa/il party \n<$B> Speak for yourself\n<$A> I also considered a section a second option as to how I would approach my address This involved my Fianna Fa/il colleagues and I, who, particularly those who were members of the last government, on a pre-arranged signal from me breaking down in tears and lamenting our luck in being out of government at this particular time  Because uh whether our opponents inside or outside the House care to acknowledge, it was the policies of Fianna Fa/il led governments since eighty-seven which has put the economy into its healthy state today\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> The House will be glad to knew know that I threw out the public crying option as an approach although it had a lot to recommend it, it would be so totally out of tune with our ever so carefully crafted media image of being untruthful, heartless, unprincipled et-cetera However, I do feel like shedding a tear for the unfortunate Irish taxpayer and the public who in the past couple of months have had it thrust upon them an inter-party Government of such divergent philosophies, policies, and ideas that I find it difficult to imagine any type of coherent medium-term strategy let alone some long-term planning being followed There are positive aspects to this budget and these I heartily welcome However, although said previously, I think that it can honestly be stated that on this occasion that rarely if ever in the history of this State has such an opportunity been afforded to any Minister for Finance I 've some sympathy for the predicament of the present Minister, but not even he can reconcile the irreconcilable His colleagues have been spending the largesse in advance As I pointed out on publication of the Book of Estimates they did not provide for expenditures which the Minister and at least some members of the Government know must be paid for in ninety-five They also point out that over a hundred and eighty million of spending financed by the tax amnesty was included in the nineteen ninety-four based numbers which means that the underlying rate of rise in the ninety-five figures was about six and a half percent, not the announced four point one percent which was done on the twenty-seventh of January If a government is not prepared to face up to the realities at the outset of its term and make decisions on priorities, what chance is there for tough decision-making as it heads nearer to a general election Absolutely none is the answer, and that 's another blow for openness transparency and accountability Now, without any shadow of a doubt the success of the past say eight years has been bought at a high price It has been bought at a price for a certain number of politicians at least on this side of the House no longer being on this side of the House or in Da/il E/ireann at all But more than anything else it brought, imposed some, a lot of hardship on some sectors of the Irish community and necessary decisions had to be  made The irony of the situation now is that the eighty-seven election campaign was run on the basis that we couldn't be trusted to have with an overall majority because we couldn't be trusted with the State 's finances Without any shadow of doubt the areas of borrowing, interest rates, and inflation are interlinked Its low interest rates and low inflation are the biggest contributors to economic improvement in that particular period of time And our record, that of the Fianna Fa/il party in being in government on their own from eighty-seven to eighty-nine with the with the Progressive Democrats afterwards and then with the Labour Party, it was our government our our Fianna Fa/il party led by Fianna Fa/il ministers and Taoisigh that contributed to that success", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Budget 2>\n\n\n<$A> Now the Minister for Finance would know, that interest rates have started to rise internationally And he would know himself, and so would other members of the House that prudence is required Now there 's one certain thing about analysts and experts, and my own view over the years always has been I get very uh dubious when they all agree on one particular point, and they all say things are going to happen in a certain direction It 's a bit like politicians and political commentators saying things are going to be this X Y and azed in, on the political compass for some time to come and we have seen in the recent past how foolhardy those particular predictions were made by all of us But where they all, I think that without any, without doing anything the Minister would be aware that there are difficulties facing us ahead Interest rate hikes will knock the gains in this particular budget, on the taxation field, anywhere in the welfare area, and in all other areas And it saps and erodes confidence It leads further to higher debt service costs and it sends us on the downward spiral again And inflation is the enemy of the poor Now I would just like to say for the benefit of the House and those commentators that over that period of eight years have not given us the credit regarding the finance and the economy that I think we deserve, not that they 're going to get up tomorrow morning and write anything flattering about us but I think we should just I should just read into the record of the House as to what the situation was at the end of eighty-six when we came to power The Exchequer borrowing requirement at the end of eighty-six was two thousand one hundred and forty-five million, which was twelve point one percent of gross national product The current budget deficit was one thousand three hundred and ninety-five million or seven point nine percent of gross national product In the end of ninety-four, as published, the total Exchequer borrowing requirement was only seventy-two million pounds or two point two percent of gross national product And may I say it was even lower than that because in answer to a question from me uh two weeks ago the Minister for Finance did concede that about a hundred and thirty million pounds of EU money that was scheduled to come in nineteen ninety-four hadn't come and would be pencilled in for ninety-five Plus if you add up the factors of special one-off payments that the Minister made uh uh to Aer Lingus and to uh the post An Post et-cetera means that we had actually a lower Exchequer borrowing requirement, but even doing the things that he did gave a zero current budget deficit at the end of for nineteen ninety-four In fact there was a surplus of fifteen million pounds And Fianna Fa/il politicians see the difficulty in winning either way Uh some of the criticism   uhm levered against my uh leader, Deputy Ahern in ninety-four was that he wasn't being tough enough on the public finances in his era of being Minister for Finance Yet he was able to achieve in three years a a situation that we hadn't been at for the previous twenty-seven It is the first current budget surplus for twenty-seven years Now I made a kind of a semi-political career \n<$A> That that was considered not just by Deputy Bruton but by a wide cross-section of opinion in this House And yet today, in January in February nineteen ninety-five we seem hell-bent on going back the same way from which we came I can welcome individual features of the budget but i 'tis flawed in its overall financial strategy Its most serious defect is the government 's refusal not to plan for  a balanced current budget in ninety-five There are people who would say we should plan for a surplus in ninety-five because we 're probably at the top of the economic cycle, now, and prudence dictates in business or in running a country that it is then that you make the tough decisions not when you 're at the bottom end of the scale because that day will come as well, and I know officials that have served in the Department of Finance would agree with me I know a lot of the members, least of all probably the Minister for Finance might agree with me, but it hasn't been done And for the first time in a quarter of a century a small current account budget surplus arose last year I regard it as quite extraordinary that the government led by Deputy John Bruton, would even countenance in this economic climate a return to the policy of current budget deficiting While it should not be a mortal sin for a politician to change his or her mind, except of course if one is a Fianna Fa/il politician  I refuse to believe that Deputy Bruton and other Fine Gael members have so U-turned their thinking on this particular policy issue It has proved exceptionally difficult for successive governments, with attendant hardship for the public dependent on public services over the last eight years, to get the public finances into some kind of order It was the policy experiment of current budget deficits which was the main contributory factor in this country arriving at a situation of near-bankruptcy in the eighties I repeat what I, Deputy Bruton and others said many years ago on this particular topic As policy as a policy experiment or option, there was nothing inherently wrong in adopting a policy of current budget deficits in the short term But the policy was a failure Of their very nature current budget deficits have no lasting economic benefit, but worse still it piled up our national debt problems to mountainous proportions, the servicing of which imposed a severe financial burden on the taxpayer to the present day It should be remembered that although our financial problems have improved, servicing the debt will cost over two thousand one hundred million in nineteen ninety-five Of course, politically it proved nearly impossible to correct that particular slide Surely we have learnt some lessons as politicians at least from those policy errors of the past The difficult corrective process took its toll not alone on politicians but on the public The vast majority of the public accepted the very tough medicine but I at least suggest that they did so on the explicit understanding that having corrected the imbalances in the past that no government would  ever repeat those mistakes I find it amazing that Deputy Bruton and his party who were passionate advocates of  of correcting the stupidity of the policy of current budget deficits not so long ago have now been silenced In my view having economically got back near to the point, only near to the point of where we set out a quarter of a century ago, it is quite daft to restart that same crazy economics again The Minister for Finance had the opportunity on this occasion to plan for a balanced budget and make a bulwark decision that would make it practically impossible for any future administration of no matter what side of this House, no matter what parties make it up, to stray from, except only in the most exceptional political circumstances, or economic circumstances Only the most exceptional And when the Minister hadn't done it today it will never be done I 'm afraid, not in my political lifetime at least, In the recent past there has been considerable debate inside and outside this House regarding the disrespect in which politicians and the political process is held, It would be well to remind everyone that this phenomenon did not start in ninety-four, but in my view it had its genesis in the foolhardy economic decisions right from the seventies We were not then prepared to live within our means as a nation and governments of all persuasions were politically unable to stop the merry-go-round In ninety-five there was an opportunity presented to this government to make a categoric statement in that area which which would have lasted into the future And I 'm not just saying it for political purpose to embarrass my good friend Deputy Ruairi Quinn I think that most sensible people, and people who 've thought about the way we 've progressed in the past twenty years, even since the time that both Deputy Quinn and I were students in Earlsfort Terrace, we surely we have made chronic mistakes economically, the lot of us But at least on this side of the House my particular particular party has demonstrated in the past eight years has learned from them A lot of things were thrown against our party in the seventies and eighties Everyone spoke about the problems that we were going to do There were programmes to eliminate budget deficits and get the finances in order over four or five years et-cetera But actually and everyone said well Fianna Fa/il 'll never do it It was Fianna Fa/il who started the process and, I, in all fairness to everybody is that we did it Deputy Garret FitzGerald spoke about, Deputy John Kelly Deputy Bruton Deputy Dukes and others, because we didn't we weren't no party was able to do it, cos there despite the best will in the world of those people it wasn't politically possible to do it until Deputy Haughey came to power in eighty-seven and set the course or the trail that my party at least has followed through, resulting in Deputy Ahern being able to in the last three years arrive at the happy situation that we have today\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$E> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$A> Deputy Barry I am the one person in the Fianna Fa/il party that publicly on television that praised Deputy Dukes for the Tallaght Strategy some years ago when he was doing it, not when he was gone And I did it inside this House I did it inside this House on those steps up there one night in a speech I praised him at the time, and I did it then and the record will show it\n<$B>  Deputy McCreevy please\n<$A>  There is an inextricable link between the levels of taxation and the levels of public service, In my opinion there is no benefit economically or indeed politically for any government or parties to create an impression that levels of public service can increase without an attendant rise in taxation or an increase in economic activity, Our high rates of taxation are a direct result of high borrowing to finance day-to-day expenditures of the past There is little point in promising more services, if we 're not going to as a nation create more economic wealth in order to be in a position to pay for them Now we would not be in the healthy situation that we are today and my sympathy to Deputy Quinn extends to the fact that I 'm sure he must have been quite livid that every morning he 'd get up for the past two weeks and read parts of what he was going to do in the budget in the papers I know it wasn't him nor do I know it was any of his officials or anyone that works with him even in a political context I 'll give him, I have no hesitation in saying that at all But it 's a pity, I I 've asked the Taoiseach earlier to take some corrective action in that  But this but this largesse that we have today would not be there unless Fianna Fa/il has done it Now despite the largesse at what has happened, the minimum that people of, anyone in Ireland would be able to say, is that at least people on Social Welfare would be able to have, be better off today and get some of the improvement which has come about Now, this, I 'll just read a few facts into the record, The Minister for Finance has read out that there will be a two and a half percent increase, for social welfare recipients Now despite the problems since eighty-seven, bad and all as the difficulties we have, no Fianna Fa/il led government has ever announced an increase of less than three percent in that period\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> In eighty-seven the most impossible year, we get three percent, eighty-eight three percent, eighty-nine three percent, nineteen-ninety five percent, ninety-one and ninety-two four percent, ninety-three three and a half percent, and in ninety-four three percent Now, this would be, I understand the difficulties of making ends meet, but Deputy Rabbitte last year, the man who knows little bit about everything and not too much about a whole lot  said\n<$C> And he wasn't here today\n<$D> Motion again \n<$A> Deputy Rabbitte is on the, I understand that Deputy Rabbitte is on the TV announcing to the Irish public uh some of the good news which he announced or had announced for the last few days himself but he thinks it 's better now to do it directly rather than have it done in the uh the other fashion", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "702338f3-7fff-4007-8b41-5c86098c896a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.293307+00:00"}

to occur, how long do you estimate you approximately, you were in the right lane having moved in it\n<$B> I just, I pulled out of the junction and I just went straight into the right-hand lane and I must have been in the right-hand lane a few minutes, five minutes I 'm not too sure long it\n<$A> For five minutes\n<$B> Or two minutes, just\n<$A> Two minutes is quite a long, maybe it was Was there heavy traffic at this time\n<$B> No there wasn't\n<$A> Well your estimate is you were in the right lane what for two minutes, Yes\n<$C> You 've already indicated to His Lordship that it was a distance of some sixty or seventy yards\n<$B> Yes That 's right\n<$C> Can you indicate to His Lordship the speed at which you may have been travelling,\n<$B> I was travelling quite slow because I had just\n<$A> Well  what does that mean approximately\n<$B> Twenty twenty-five miles per hour\n<$A> Yes\n<$B>   Because \n<$C>  Now  \n<$B> Oh sorry\n<$C> Sorry When you exited from Jungle Jim 's, were you already moving at that point or had you stopped again at the uh exit to Jungle Jim 's\n<$B> I was stopped at the junction from Jungle Jim 's\n<$A> So you you came to the exit, you stopped, you looked to your right\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> You saw a car in the distance, you thought you 'd time to get out, you moved across into the outer lane, indicated you were going right\n<$B> That 's correct My Lord\n<$A> And what happened then\n<$C> And you accelerated up to a speed you would estimate perhaps twenty miles an hour\n<$B> Yes That 's correct,\n<$C> Now, at that speed, one wouldn't have expected\n<$A> This sounds like a leading question coming\n\n<$A> Apologies\n<$B> Yes okay\n<$C> Now Miss <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> you told His Lordship you were established in the right-hand lane, that you were indicating to turn right, uh this was the entrance to the Abbey Centre Can you tell His Lordship precisely what point perhaps with reference to uh the photographs were you when the collision occurred,\n<$A> Maybe photograph three is maybe the best of the three, subject to any views to the contrary from Counsel\n<$B> Photograph three I had pulled into the right-hand lane again   and  the exit here, I had indicated to turn right   and  I was in the midst of turning when the impact hit from behind\n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> Well can you just mark on the photograph where where you were when the impact occurred No, if you just mark it You 'd need a pen Somebody 'll give you a pen uh, Right I thought you uh when you came out you 'd moved into the lane furthest   away from yours Is that right\n<$B> Yes that 's right\n<$A> I I I don't, I may show it to Counsel I don't think she 's marked it correctly She 's put it in the wrong lane from what she 's said so far She puts it in the near-side lane instead of the outer lane\n<$C> Yes My Lord I think I understand what 's happened\n<$A> Sorry Do you agree it 's wrong on what she 's said so far\n<$C> I I do My Lord <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> I 'm sorry\n<$C> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> I believe I know where this misunderstanding\n<$A>  if you just look at the photograph Just, just, do you see the photograph\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Now when you, you, just look towards me a moment You came out from there isn't that right You came out there, you moved across towards the photographer and you were going to turn into\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Now do you agree you 've marked it in the wrong place\n<$B> Yes I have I 've marked, I 've marked where I came out of the junction\n<$A> Yeah no I  what I asked for was when you were struck, was what I asked you, in the moment of impact where were you\n<$B> Sorry I was here\n<$A> Yes well just, if you just would mark it afresh please, Well what I asked you to do was to , is is that meant to be the outline of the front of your car You 've drawn the line as distinct from an X You 've just  drawn that in have you\n<$B> Yes I was, that 's where I was turning into\n<$A> Yes I appreciate that 's where you were turning in but what I wanted you to mark insofar as you could do so is where exactly your car was when it was struck\n<$B> I was in the midst of turning when the car\n<$A> I know that but that could be anywhere from there up into here\n<$C> Just at the the start\n<$A> Would you just, the tradition is if you 'd put an X and I appreciate it 's an only an approximation, if you put an X as to where your car was when it was struck rather than that long line And take your time, get it as accurately as you can,\n\n<$A> Thank-you\n<$C> You were already at the junction and ready to turn <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Now could you describe the actual collision to His Lordship\n<$B> Sorry Repeat the question\n<$C> Could you describe the actual collision to His Lordship\n<$A> I, it may, <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>, counsel knows all about it, you can't ask a leading question He can't say to you for example, if I 'm correct you were sitting at a station and this car came along at twenty miles an hour and crashed into your rear You can't say that You have to give the reference not me And he 's to ask the questions in a particular way He can't lead you So that 's why he 's asking you in this rather official way Yes Ask it again please\n<$C> Could you describe the collision to His Lordship\n<$B> My Lord, I was   turning when uhm\n<$A> Now were you stationary or moving at the time\n<$B> I was, wasn't stationary but I was barely at a crawl I was at a crawling pace\n<$C> Yes\n<$B> Indicating to turn right when I was just hit from behind, and the car swung me into the other lane then and we both came to a halt\n<$A> Which was your car, U UAZ or UIB\n<$B> UIB\n<$A> Yes\n<$C> Following the collision, can you tell His Lordship what you did\n<$B> Following the collision, we got out of the car, traffic had stopped, and Mr Wheatley got out of his car\n<$C> And that would be the driver of the other car\n<$B> Yes, indeed\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> Both of us asked what happened I said I didn't know what happened I I was just turning and I I was\n<$A> Just just a moment please, You say you both asked what happened\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> And what was said then\n<$B> We were unsure of who caused the accident or what happened\n<$A> Well if you just tell me first of all what you said and what he said, if anything\n<$B> I asked what happened and, Mr Wheatley said he didn't know and then he said that we should call for police,\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> Mr Wheatley went to the car, asked me did we want to move the cars into the side of the road\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> To let other drivers past\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> I says no And he said he was rushing, he was  already late, he was rushing to get to a football match,\n<$A> Yes\n<$C> Uhm, were the police called\n<$B> Yes My Lord, the police were then called\n<$C> And\n<$B> The children then were taken away in the ambulance to Whiteabbey Hospital\n<$C> Now you 've already told His Lordship that there was some discussion as regards whether or not the cars were moved prior to the arrival of the police Were the cars moved\n<$B> No, indeed not, no\n<$C> Yes\n<$C> Would you then tell His Lordship about after the police arrived <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$B> The police then arrived and called for the ambulance The children then were taken away in an ambulance to Whiteabbey Hospital I stayed behind, my partner came up, I phoned for him to come up to see if I could get the car moved\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> We then we moved the car and uh I followed on in my partner 's car up to the hospital to see the children,\n<$C> Now how did you feel immediately after the accident\n<$B> Very shocked and, concerned more about the children,\n<$C> Uhm, were you experiencing any problems physically at that time\n<$B> Just stiffness I had hurt my chest on the, the steering wheel of the car and just, just shock and stress I think\n<$C> Now, at the point that the impact actually occurred, can you tell us what, what actually happened to you personally in the car\n\n<$C> When you came uh to the junction uh and were about to take your left-hand turn on the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Road, did you check your right\n<$B> Yes Indeed I did\n<$C> And, what distance was the car which was now coming down the street the car, what distance was it away from that junction uh when you looked to your right\n<$A> Uh do you mean from the junction she was at or the one\n<$C> Yes, from the junction you were at, to Mr Wheatley 's car What distance, approximately <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Now that 's when you stopped and looked to your right before you exited That 's what you 're\n<$B> Yes, I 'm not sure My Lord how far back it would have been, how many yards I would be, but I believed he was far enough back he was just\n<$A> But but but that 's, see you 'll have to give some idea I mean you ran a hundred yards I 'm sure, maybe metres You know what a hundred yards is approximately\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Well was it half of that or was it a hundred yards or was it twice that\n<$B> It could have been seventy to a hundred yards Yes it was\n<$A> Seventy to a hundred yards to your right\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Yes\n<$C> And, when you looked and you saw that car, you then believed that you had room for the manoeuvre For the <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> to start, you had to pull out onto the <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> Road\n<$B> Yes that 's correct\n<$C> You had to change from the left-hand lane to the right-hand lane\n<$B> Go across the left-hand lane\n<$C> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> But do you accept that you have to traverse across two carriageways Is that right\n<$B> That 's correct\n<$C> And had to slow down Yet you speeded up according to a friend to at least twenty-five miles per hour but by the time you reached the entrance to McDonald 's you had actually slowed your vehicle down to walking or crawling pace That 's how you described it\n<$B> That 's correct\n<$C> And had indicated and then made the manoeuvre to the right, into the Abbey Centre\n<$B> That 's correct\n<$C> Now you knew before you pulled out that you had to make a series of manoeuvres, going from the minor road onto the major road and then making a manoeuvre from the major road into the right Is that correct\n<$B> That 's correct Yes\n<$C> And you felt that the distance of seventy to a hundred yards would allow you to do that\n<$B> Yes I felt that he was far enough away for me to do that Yes\n<$C> See, I 'd have to suggest to you that the length of time that 's likely for you to have completed that manoeuvre would be something in the region of twelve seconds, <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> ten to twelve seconds It 's not an exact science but <unclear> several sylls </unclear> to say that that would be a reasonable time to allow you do to that manoeuvre\n<$B> Yes\n<$C> Now, do you disagree or agree with that\n<$B> I agree with that\n<$C> And I have to suggest to you that from a distance of a hundred yards to the point of impact, if this man Mr Wheatley had been travelling at twenty miles per hour, it would have taken about fifteen seconds to cover that distance At twenty-five miles per hour it would have taken twelve seconds, at thirty miles an hour, ten seconds and at thirty-five miles an hour, eight point six seconds So whatever speed he was travelling at, I have to suggest to you that he would have been arriving at or about the junction about the same time as you made the manoeuvre into it", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source":

nineteen ninety-four, the second, September nineteenth nineteen ninety-six Dr Early will you outline to His Lordship your qualifications and position\n<$C> I 'm a consultant dermatologist at Craigavon Area Hospital My qualifications are, Doctor of Medicine and Member of the Royal College of Physicians of London\n<$A> Now you first examined uh the plaintiff on the fourteenth of October nineteen ninety-four Is that correct\n<$C> That is correct\n<$A> And you ascertained that, you took a history from the plaintiff at that stage Is that right\n<$C> That is correct\n<$A> Could you outline the\n<$D> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$A> You uh reached a diagnosis on the basis of the history taken and your examination of the plaintiff uh at that time, isn't that right Doctor\n<$C> That is correct\n<$A> And what was the diagnosis\n<$C> I felt that he had a  contact dermatitis affecting his hands and forearms\n<$A> And were you able to attribute that to anything in particular at that time\n<$C> I thought it was most likely due to uh the wetness, the continuous wetness at work, but also uh possibly due to the  irritancy of the plasticised PVC paste and uh methylated spirits\n<$A> How serious was the rash at the time that you examined him initially\n<$C> It seemed to be quite bad at the time when I saw him in October uh nineteen ninety-four Uh he had a lot of eczematous dermatitis affecting several fingers Some of the fingers had deep fissures or cuts in them uh which were making uh bending of the fingers difficult It was worse on the right hand than on the left hand,\n<$A> Now you re-examined on the thirteenth of September nineteen ninety-six Is that correct\n<$C> That is correct\n<$A> And at that time, on examination uh what did you find\n<$B> His rash appeared to be much less at that stage, uhm he had some eczematous dermatitis on the sides of his right middle finger, and some on the sides of the left little finger, and the web space between the right ring, right forefinger and middle finger Otherwise the skin was was uh quite normal\n<$A> Now at the time of your uh initial inspection you  didn't have access to the plaintiff 's General Practitioner 's notes Is that correct\n<$C> Apart from uh referral letters to the Craigavon Area Hospital where I work\n<$A> Now you you had the entire uh General Practitioner 's notes by the time that you examined on the second occasion\n<$C> That is correct\n<$A> And did anything arise from those which had a bearing on your diagnosis and your what your consideration of the plaintiff 's condition\n<$C> Uhm it was quite clear that Mr Mallory had attended his General Practitioner on a number of occasions with rash on his forearms and hands and uh the General Practitioner had also considered this to be possibly work-related,\n<$A> There was reference in the General Practitioner 's notes to uh other skin uh related problems\n<$C> That is right Uhm in I think August nineteen ninety-three he appeared to have a rash on his scalp Uhm no diagnosis was made by the General Practitioner and he was referred on to Craigavon Area Hospital\n<$A> And what diagnosis was made there\n<$C> They made a diagnosis of this being psoriasis affecting his scalp\n<$A> Did you reach any view as regards that uh that rash and that diagnosis\n<$C> Uh according to the hospital notes he was reviewed once afterwards uh and the rash on his scalp had improved well Uhm I can only presume that he may have had psoriasis on the scalp I personally didn't see it myself,\n<$A> Did it have any bearing on your uh diagnosis of a contact irritant dermatitis caused by substances in work\n<$C> I don't think the fact that he had psoriasis on his scalp would uhm influence the fact that he could have had an irritant contact dermatitis on his hands In other words, a separate condition\n<$A> There were, there was another uh reference in relation to a skin problem uh round about the same time in nineteen ninety-three Is that correct\n<$C> I don't think that appears in the General Practitioner notes,\n<$A> Will you just look at your your General Practitioner paragraph A of the General Practitioner 's notes in your second report,\n<$C> And we 're we 're referring to what date\n<$A> That 's your report of\n<$C> Yes Sorry what date for the General Practitioner\n<$A> November twenty-ninth nineteen ninety-three The reference is Dr Stack, who 's a colleague   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>  at Craigavon Hospital\n<$C>  That 's right  \n<$C> She 's a an associate specialist at Craigavon Area Hospital uh where he had attended with his scalp rash and his hand rash\n<$A> Now in relation to the scalp rash and hand rash again was that the same attendance\n<$C> Both were uhm  both were mentioned at the at the first attendance with Dr Stack\n<$A> Then there 's the second  that first attendance is the twenty-seventh of September nineteen  ninety-three The plaintiff 's second attendance was November twenty-ninth nineteen ninety-three\n<$C> That is correct\n<$A> And what was what was that in relation to\n<$C> That again uh was a review appointment uh by Dr Stack She felt that the uh scalp uh psoriasis had cleared well In fact she said it  cleared  completely Uhm but at this stage he, uh Mr Mallory was complaining of, or was noted to have scattered eczema on his body\n<$A> Now there 's reference to that being attributable to using a a perfumed body spray\n<$C> That is correct\n<$A> Would that have a bearing on your diagnosis of contact irritant dermatitis especially on the hand\n<$C> Uh it is difficult to know exactly what was being, what was uh causing this this eczema on his body I really don't know what this was Uh he does not appear subsequently on patch testing to be allergic to perfume but I couldn't rule that out Uh it may be that he is more likely to develop eczema because he has what is known as an atopic tendency, that is he also suffers from asthma,\n<$A> If he does suffer from asthma would that have any bearing on his uh potential for uh contracting a condition such as uh dermatitis\n<$C> That 's most certainly would have uh an influence It is well recognised that people who suffer from asthma or hay fever or who have had a past history of eczema are more likely to develop uh contact dermatitis, especially of the irritant type when put in work with skin irritants or wet work,\n<$A> Now at the time that you carried out your uh second examination and prepared the second report you had the benefit of seeing the safety data sheet which had been furnished by the defendant Is that correct\n<$C> That is correct\n<$A> Now these show that the the plaintiff was in uh contact with a number of substances First of all, methylated spirits Would methylated spirits be a substance which could cause uh skin problems\n<$C> Yes Uh  methylated spirits uh is basically alcohol which would de-fat skin and make it much more likely to develop irritant contact dermatitis, or to even cause it in the first place,\n<$A> What would be the usual way to protect the the user of methylated spirits from uh contracting dermatitis\n<$C> To wear gloves,\n<$A> Now you also uh had access to the safety data sheet in respect of the plastic paste Is that right\n<$C> That is correct\n<$A> Was there any reference there to their effect on the skin\n<$C> Yes the data sheet indicated that the  the plasticiser or PVC was a mild irritant on the skin, and if there was uh skin contact that uh it should be washed off with large amounts of soap and water It is also suggested in these data sheets that  neoprene gloves should be worn while working with this substance,\n<$A> Now they 're described as mildly irritant on the skin\n<$C> That is correct\n<$A> Now  uh uh, can you uh describe to or explain to His Lordship how a mild irritant would cause skin trouble\n<$C> Yes  Irritant contact dermatitis uh is caused often by the accumulative effect of a number of uh agents acting on the skin over fairly protracted uh periods of time I would see the irritants here as being firstly wetness at work, uh also the  plasticised PVC paste and DIP moulding materials, and also methylated spirits to be cumulative in their effect against the skin I wouldn't attribute this rash to any particular one of those agents but to the cumulative effect of all of them,\n<$A> The plaintiff uh says that he still, or would say that he still suffers from flare-ups from the rash even now that he 's been moved to a clean dry job Can you explain that\n<$C> Yes Uhm once uh hand eczema or irritant contact dermatitis has been established, it is well recognised that flare-ups can occur, often for no good and apparent reason for between nine and eighteen months  after the person is removed from the source of the irritant,\n<$A> What would be the prognosis in this case\n<$C> I think the prognosis uh generally would be good uhm if this gentleman was removed from wet work, work with skin irritants and potential skin allergens, I think with time his hands should settle back to normal, uh and he, if he was not placed in a similar position would uh, his hands would would revert to normal,\n<$A> Finally the plaintiff was patch tested uhm to see if he was allergic to the substances and this all turned out to be negative\n<$C> Yes Uh patch testing to all of these substances uh was negative, indicating that he was not or did not seem to be allergic to any of them\n<$D> Uh, I haven't really had an opportunity to read the reports

request of Messrs Quinn and Macmillan the plaintiff 's solicitors did you uh visit the Springfield Road in Belfast on the eighth of November nineteen ninety-nine\n<$A> That 's correct My Lord\n<$D> And can you tell My Lord, did you go alone or did anyone go with you\n<$A> Uh no I was on my own Uh I I called with the uh plaintiff but uh her mother informed me that she was ill at the time and could not attend\n<$D> And did you have anything uh with you to indicate the uh locus where you were to carry out your inspection\n<$A> Yes I used uh Mr Ridley 's black and white photographs uh to uh identify the uh location\n<$D> And did you go to the part of the Springfield Road then shown in those three black and white photographs\n<$A> That 's correct\n<$D> Can you tell My Lord, uh did you uh locate the uh depression shown in the uh first of the black and white photographs\n<$A> Yes the one with the rules in it yes\n<$D> And can you tell me now did you measure the length width and depth of that depression\n<$A> Yes it 's uhm, it it it obviously, it it dishes up and down so it 's uh seven to eight inches long, five to six inches wide and I measured the uh depth of the depression with a probe and measured it as an inch deep,\n<$D> And uh <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> evidence from the photographs but what what part of the footpath was it in in terms of uh location on the footpath\n<$A> Central\n<$D> And uh what kind of uh location is this, uh the Springfield Road\n<$A> The Springfield Road would be uhm a fairly uh heavily pedestrianised area It would take a lot of pedestrian traffic down into the town\n<$D> Now can you say anything to My Lord in relation to the nature of the depression depression in terms of how visible or otherwise it is as one walks along\n<$A> Well it 's, it 's, it depends on really the lighting conditions the the you know if it 's a dull day or whatever it is But I mean it is the same, basically the same colour as the surrounding asphalt Uh so it uh, it wouldn't be uh, you know it 's, if you 're looking directly at it, as with anything you 'll see it But if you 're depending on your peripheral vision which is uh what most people do, then it 's difficult to pick up detail Peripheral vision tends to pick at best a a, a difference in colour\n<$D> And would you uh have anything to say to My Lord in terms of the effect of this depression for pedestrians walking along the footpath\n<$A> Well it is, it is a a a sizeable uh depression It 's uh, at its deepest point it I mean it will, because of the the the situation of the depression it will tend to fill up sort of seasonally and down with mud so it becomes uh uh visually sort of different and a as maybe days change Uhm but if there 's just soft mud at the bottom of it it could be even more deceptive because the heel will just go straight through it, or the or the toe will go straight through it So in my view yes it would be a hazard to pedestrians\n<$D> Now, Miss <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> described to My Lord that uh her heel or the heel of her shoe which she described to be heeled on a platform uh   so  that the heel of that went into the depression\n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> Yes\n<$D> Uhm, is it the sort of depression that would uhm encompass or capture the the heel in the way she described\n<$A> Well there is a difference in level of a as I measure it at its deepest point an inch, looking at Mr Ridley 's photograph it appears to be more like just over three quarters of an inch Uhm I mean that would be enough to arrest any uh approaching foot\n<$D> Could you uh form any impression in remembering June ninety-nine as to whether this was something which had just happened or something which had been there I appreciate your just having the black and white photographs\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> In June nineteen ninety-nine\n<$A> Yes Well, uhm I would have uh, I 'd be of the impression that this is actually not something which has come about due to wear and tear Uhm the general surface of the asphalt in that area uh is uhm, is quite rough uh uh, not the type of smooth surface you would tend to get with a well rolled impacted surface And uh in my opinion the probably the most likely uhm uh situation is that this depression occurred very shortly after the asphalt was laid, in fact probably uhm within even hours or or certainly days of the asphalt laying and uh that type of depression can come about uhm due to air pockets being left in the asphalt\n<$C> Sorry due to what,   air pockets \n<$A>  Air pockets   If you, if you 're putting a batch of asphalt out on a footpath and then you put another batch out on on on a  on like and making a a momentary joint like a few minutes later or maybe you know if there isn't enough asphalt to complete the patch and you get some more in, what you can do is you can actually form an air  air pocket in around that and uh the uhm the three sort of uh defects which were referred to before if you notice are in a line across the footpath And uh that would indicate to me\n<$C> I 'm sorry what did you say\n<$A> They they appear to be in a line across the footpath\n<$C> There there are other similar ones across the   footpath \n<$A>  Yeah   there, well there there there are uh lesser uh sort of depressions on the footpath\n<$D> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Are you taking that from these photographs\n<$A> Yes,\n<$C> Well from the and I appreciate you 're going on the photographs and then seeing it   some  short time later, how long would it have been there approximately\n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> I would say it has been there uhm from in around the time the asphalt was laid Uh\n<$C> Yes well leaving that aside When would that have been approximately In case there 's, there may be evidence\n<$A> Several, several   years uh  My Lord I can't say with any sort of exactness but several years I would suggest, It 's not a typical wear and tear type depression\n<$C>  Several years  \n<$C> Yes I 've noted you said that Well does it get progressively worse as time passes\n<$A> That to me wouldn't, I would say that that depression formed uh\n<$C> Within hours or days would you say\n<$A> Yes within hours or, I would favour hours nearly more than days It 's the sort of depression which comes if an air pocket if the asphalt is still hot, it will collapse\n<$C> Yes that 's what I thought you were going to say\n<$D> If one wanted to repair that defect that 's shown in the black and white photograph and in <unclear> several sylls </unclear> photograph\n<$A> Yes\n<$D> What what 's involved in repairing that\n<$A> Uhm it 's basically, uh the the proper way to repair it is to cut out a a rectangle around it to give a good key of asphalt uhm around it and then uh basically prime the edge of the the cut out hole and uh re-lay the asphalt Uh you would only need say a foot square or a foot by eight inches, something like that to, to uh, it 's quite isolated the the the fault so it would be really a a very short-time job for an asphalt crew\n<$D> Thank-you\n<$E> Mr McBrinn I think you said you were out in November nineteen ninety-nine Is that right\n<$A> Yes Uhm I was out on the eighth of November nineteen ninety-nine\n<$E> Five months or so after Mr Ridley was out Is that right\n<$A> Yes I believe he was out on the fifteenth of June nineteen ninety-nine\n<$E> And uhm I think you said that you thought Mr Ridley 's photographs appeared to show something about three quarters of an inch or thereabouts\n<$A> Yes\n<$E> And uhm, did you look at exactly the same\n<$A> Yes\n<$E> Depression Uhm and uhm if you were saying that perhaps it was in inch, there may not be very much in it one way or the other, but you were saying about an inch\n<$A> Yeah well what you 'll get is you 'll find that the, the, the bottom of the, as you can see in Mr Ridley 's photographs that the mud will gather and that will either uh build up or clear out as, seasonally So uh basically what I did just to to test the full depth was just to put a probe down\n<$E> Was that into the mud\n<$A> Into the mud yes\n<$E> So that would account for the perhaps the discrepancy between the two\n<$A> Oh yes I mean you can get a discrepancy seasonally and it could be less than Mr Ridley 's or it could be more\n<$E> And uhm the, as far as width is concerned uh, it appears to be uh a nine or ten inch horizontal rule It appears to be something in the region of what, eight or nine inches across\n<$A> Yes Unfortunately I don't have the black and white photographs in front of me so I, thank-you, Yes I mean if you look at the horizontal rule on the right-hand side, it 's about seven and a half inches and on the left-hand side, maybe one and a half to two inches It dishes down at that point\n<$E> And as you use the the word yourself it is, it uh forms a dish or a shape of a dish\n<$A> Yes Most most depressions are\n<$E> And it would be in the uh shape of a dish both directions\n<$A> Yes\n<$E> And that 's quite a contrary uh set of circumstances from say a sudden difference of level which you might get uh from a vertical edge\n<$A> Yes well as I say most depressions do form a dish of some sort I mean the only time you 'll really get a vertical edge on a footway is if there 's uh a classical pothole which is normally caused by frost action, by the, by just a sheer, a sheer cut through into the asphalt\n<$E> That 's a pothole\n<$A> Yes but it, this is this is a depression This is, I mean all depressions will be dished They don't, they don't go in a square <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>\n<$E> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> difference in level between flagstones\n<$A> Yes\n<$E> And uh the likelihood of catching your foot in something is much greater uh when it 's a vertical or a sudden difference of level of land than when it 's dished Isn't that right\n<$A> Yes if the vertical surface it 's safe I 'd say, reasonable to say that it 's more chance of trapping a toe for example or a heel\n<$E> And uh if a department with limited resources tends to concentrate on that type of defect would that be something which you would see as a good thing", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2d9c4cc9-f32c-40eb-b3b7-1a0ba0e704af", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.295910+00:00"}
{"text": "<Adoption>\n\n\n<$A> The difficulty for children is that at other times they are aware that other foster children are also going to see their parents and that reminds them of their own parental contact and then it will remind them of the fact that they haven't seen their parents and obviously that can be very difficult for them\n<$B> You hear what Doctor <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> was saying that if you have it in the setting with the grandparents, uh where there 's an extended family there you have one set of grandparents you maybe have a couple of other grandchildren, if the mother and father don't turn up well then they can be handled within that situation But if the child is seeing the grandparents and the other children, perhaps it 's not quite so damaging if they don't turn   up,  particularly if it only happened once or twice a year But equally so he said, one would have to have a situation where they were playing the game, that that the parents did turn up, that they behaved appropriately and that there was some consistency in them turning up But he said if all things went well, he could see some benefits in having that kind of set-up Now what 's your view about that\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A> To come back to the point I made previously I think there are issues that we really need to assess before we can say definitively, that would be a positive contact for Neil and that really is about Judith uhm accepting, if it happens that Neil has been adopted, accepting his adoptive place and supporting him in that, and being sure that there is no friction between her and her mother <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> during contact sessions and that the relationships with them, between them themselves are harmonious enough to make sure that contact is good contact\n<$C> So, I had understood that the Trust was recommending that there should not be contact, uh post-freeing it should be reduced down and post-adoption there should be no contact Is that what you 're saying that that 's not the case, that your that your view is that really it should be looked at\n<$A> Well the Trust is obviously reviewing its position in terms of we did not have that information uhm from Doctor Martin prior to us completing our report His advice at that stage was that there should be no uhm direct post-adoption contact In view of what he has said, yes we 're saying we 're willing to revise that and look and see if that sort of contact could be in Neil 's best interest\n<$B> But the concerns would be one that, she might undermine the placement  , I mean there  might be friction with her grandmother or with her mother\n<$A>  Yes My Lord because  \n<$A> There may be ongoing friction between Mrs Brown and Judith\n<$B> And there is the problem that she doesn't turn up and the child again becomes upset\n<$A> Yeah I mean that 's the other difficulty that there 's a long pattern of inconsistency and obviously for any child there 's a considerable disappointment when they have the   expectation,  particularly seeing a mother and father who are particularly important to them and those people do not appear\n<$A>  Yes  \n<$C> Mrs Rooney the pattern of inconsistency you will maybe accept that it wasn't in any way like Mr Rooney 's inconsistency\n<$A> That 's a comparison but overall, uhm it 's not been a consistent pattern from Judith\n<$C> But she has seen Neil consistently from uh the summer of two thousand right through until Mr Rooney came back on the scene at the beginning of summer two thousand and one\n<$A> I 'm sure there have been prolonged periods of time when Judith has not had contact\n<$C> And there have been prolonged periods of time when she has had contact <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> That 's correct but there have been prolonged periods of time also when there 's been no contact\n<$C> Is the quality of the contact very good between Mrs Rooney and her son\n<$A> Yes I 've seen Judith and Neil together and there certainly is uhm a lot of warmth expressed uhm between mother and son\n<$B> There certainly is what\n<$A> A lot of warmth They were very comfortable with each other, uhm there 's a lot of physical contact, they 're obviously uhm very fond of one another\n<$B> And I mean is that all the more cause that there 'll be a problem when she doesn't turn up The child has got a bond with her and then   <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  expectation and then she doesn't show\n<$A>  Yes My Lord I think  \n<$A> I think it adds to the child 's disappointment if contact is positive and very positive that uhm when the parent does not turn up and the child 's expectation has been raised for something that they regard as a positive experience and that does not happen, yes I think it does make it a much more damaging experience\n<$C> But Mrs Rooney had <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> to the Trust plan to contact the social worker for a contact visit That had been that, although contact had stopped in the summer of last year it was re-established eventually and Mrs Rooney had turned up for visits\n<$A> Yes visits only stopped because we had set a clear expectation that Judith had to evidence she was willing to attend appointments consistently and with ourselves before we opened Neil up to any further hurt and disappointment And it was some considerable time before Judith evidenced that to us and that caused the delay in restarting contact\n<$C> Well it caused part of the delay in restarting contact because records would indicate that Mrs Rooney was seeking contact with him in early October and that <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Neil was not available over the Halloween period So all of the delay in re-establishing contact cannot be laid at Mrs Rooney 's door\n<$A> I think my understanding my recall is of one cancelled visit by the social worker but I 'm aware that Mrs Rooney was given numerous appointments uhm with the social workers and she didn't attend I 'm not saying that there weren't delays in terms of sometimes things come up for the Trust uhm and obviously if Neil was on holiday that would have delayed that further\n<$C> Yes but the fact of the matter is that all of the delay in re-establishing contact was not all Mrs Rooney 's fault\n<$A> Mrs Rooney could have attended uhm appointments with the social worker quite early in that process on a consistent basis and contact as a result would have resumed at a much earlier stage than that which it did\n<$C> Is it the Trust 's view, <unclear> several sylls </unclear> but is it the Trust 's view that it would be dangerous to increase contact in case of <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Sorry could you repeat that question for me\n<$C> \n<$A> Well the Trust has to look very carefully and to weigh up a balance between developing and the relationship between a mother and child uhm and not setting a child up to be further disappointed So that is why we had a series of meetings which resulted in contact being increased uhm gradually over a period of time\n<$C> And as soon as the Trust decided that uh they were going ahead with the Freeing application isn't it the case that the Trust would then revert to that decision, that they don't want to increase the contact because it could lead to expectation <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Yes that is the case because the plan is no longer for rehabilitation uhm so yes that is entirely true,\n\n<$D> Can I ask you a question at all Miss McPeake about adoption for Neil Do you think uh Neil can wait for further assessments to be carried out, as has been suggested\n<$A> No, uhm I think Neil 's waited quite a long period of time already and as Doctor Martin pointed out, the earlier a child is placed in an adoptive home, the more likely it is that that uh placement will be a long-term and successful one\n<$D> Uh we appreciate the uh Currans are being assessed at the moment If their assessment is positive, do you think that they will adopt Neil\n<$A> Yes I, I believe at this stage the Currans have had a long period of time to consider their commitment to this process and we would not be putting them through the assessment itself which in itself is quite strenuous and quite a stress and strain with them We would not do that unless we were very sure they were committed to adopting Neil if they are successful\n<$D> If they are not successful, are there further, are there other prospective adopters available who might consider Neil\n<$A> Yes Neil has a number of advantages Uhm, he has no disability, uhm he is of at least average intelligence, uhm he is of a young age, he has no significant behavioural or emotional problems at this stage so he will be very easy to place in an adoptive home\n<$D> So you think he 's likely to be adopted   <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  adoption\n<$A>  I think  \n<$A> It is extremely likely we will find an adoptive home I would like to think, well I 'm pretty sure that we will have a choice of several adoptive homes for Neil and we would choose the most appropriate match,\n<$D> You were asked by my learned friend Mrs Stoneley about uhm the presence of other foster children in the home and she suggested to you that that might help him overcome, were he to be in long-term foster care, any difficulties or stigma over having a different name <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> Is it also possible in your experience that the existence of other children in foster care can increase the sense of insecurity, that they <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> That 's very much the case It can also present increasing risk My Lord because very often children come into care and we 're not aware of their backgrounds uhm and many come into care having been severely abused themselves and they frequently act out with other children including other foster children so that can actually present a significant risk to a child who remains in long-term foster care\n<$D> Well even if he was with the Currans and they were continuing to foster other children long-term, if he were adopted, would he have the security of knowing that he had been adopted\n<$A> He would have the security of knowing he would be adopted uhm and the Trust would also take the view that the , the the Currans could not continue to be foster carers unless it is approved for a specific child who they may already have placed long-term with them We would not accept the position where other children were coming and going in that placement\n<$D> You were asked about uh familial replacement, and I appreciate that Miss Magill will give evidence in view of the overview of this case\n<$A> That is correct\n<$D> Do you know if there was a family uh planning meeting held on Christmas Eve nineteen ninety-nine, involving Miss Magill and Mr Daniel Green\n<$A> Yes I believe at that meeting uhm both the Assistant Principal social worker and the social worker did look at the various family members who could provide a placement for Neil and those were all considered\n<$D> Who, who is Mr Green\n<$A> Mr Daniel Green at that time was the the Assistant Principal social worker uhm responsible for Neil 's care\n<$D> I would have liked to have thought they were going to be made available but, but there also was an assessment <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> on Mr Francis Brown who 's presumably a brother and his partner Miss Sinead Blaney\n<$A> Yes I believe several members of the Brown family were also assessed\n<$D> As well as Paula Roberts\n<$A> That is correct,\n<$D> So far as contact is concerned, if My Lord was minded to grant the Freeing Order, what would the Trust 's plan be in respect of contact with the natural parents during the period between the granting of the freeing order and the making of the Adoption Application\n<$A> I think our view would be, I mean I have been advised by various experts that at that stage we should be reducing contact uhm and gradually reducing that to the level that it would be post-adoption if it should be post-adoption at all", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

would be into the cul-de-sac uhm I observed a large crowd of people gathered around a green Nova car Uhm when I dismounted my vehicle and was approaching the vehicle uhm I observed a female uhm strike two other females, towards the rear off-side of this this car Uhm I also noticed that the driver 's door was open and that there was a male person uhm having a dispute with the driver of the vehicle Uhm fearing for the safety of the driver uhm I went over and advised the people there to stay back and let the police deal with the matter and I escorted the driver of the vehicle into a police vehicle for his own safety\n<$B> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> identify the two people that were uhm <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Uhm the, the two ladies were being assaulted by the

been an accident that had occurred sometime previously\n<$A> Yes it was reported to the police as an injury accident and that the offending vehicle had left the scene\n<$B> Did you speak to the defendant about leaving the scene\n<$A> Sorry say it again\n<$B> Did, did you speak to the defendant driver about why he 'd left the scene of the accident\n<$A> Uhm, on arrival of the police at the scene, obviously the the driver of the other vehicle had returned and we say, due to the hostile situation at the at the time uhm the police wished to get him offside so, for his own safety and also too, the crowd were quite hostile towards the police initially on arrival Our uhm main task at hand was to get the sketch and that prepared at the time and to deal with the matter back at the station\n<$B> And did, sorry did you ascertain from him why he had left the scene of the accident previously\n<$A> Well he wasn't aware that he had left the scene of the accident, and obviously he 'd left and come back but he wasn't aware that it was reported as a hit-and-run accident He 'd wasn't aware of that fact As far as he 's concerned he had spoke to the, the uhm, ascertained the child was okay and as far as he 's concerned there 's no reason why the police would want to speak to him, in relation to this matter\n<$B> And <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> any charge in respect of leaving the

the time, no Uhm she was receiving medical treatment and it was sometime later on that evening at about twenty past ten that night that I called round to the house again to speak with the parents and to check on the condition of the young girl\n<$B> And can you recall what was said to you about what happened, the circumstances of the accident\n<$A> Basically I went uhm into the house identified myself I was the police officer that had been there earlier on uhm informed them of what action the police had taken to date in relation to the accident, namely uhm we had interviewed all the witnesses known to the police at the time and uhm inquired about the condition of the girl and uhm, in fact uhm mentioned to her you know that we had interviewed everyone that we knew that had witnessed the accident or knew anything about the accident\n<$B> And what was your response <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Uhm response, well, neither the mother nor the father made any indication that they had seen the accident or had been party to anything that happened immediately after the time of the accident\n<$B> We 've heard the evidence of the mother today where she gives the impression of actually being at the scene of the accident very soon after She 's given evidence for the position of the defendant 's vehicle on the road et-cetera Is that the impression that you obtained from her at the time\n<$A> I certainly got speaking to the both parents in the house that evening uhm, I was of the the belief that uhm the mother was in the house at the time of the accident and was alerted by a neighbour and at no time was any mention made to me of her seeing vehicles on the wrong side of the road or anything else\n\n<$B> Uh sorry, did you interview then the daughter in respect of the accident\n<$A> No she was interviewed by Constable Callan\n<$B> Did you have a a look at these bicycles that had caused the accident\n<$A> I did Yes the bicycle was pointed out to me which was lying in the front garden of the house Uhm\n<$B> Were the other bicycles there\n<$A> I 'm not aware of any other bicycles I couldn't honestly say whether there was or\n<$B> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$A> I couldn't answer that question\n<$B> What would you say to His Lordship about the condition of the bicycle that you saw\n<$A> Uhm the bicycle pointed out to me uhm had substantial damage to the front forks It was bent back and the front wheel was obviously bent back against the, the frame of the bicycle Uhm I did check, and I 'm informed by the mother that the brakes weren't working I did check the brakes on the back wheel which, I found whenever I spun the wheel and checked both  the brake lever, the wheel continued to spin and there was no pads sufficient to slow down the back wheel\n<$B> Can I just take you back a point You said that you had been told about the condition of the bike Who had told you about the condition\n<$A> Uhm it was the mother of

into the junction, Uhm yes to the right on on photograph three there just as you turn into the junction\n<$B> And roughly how far was that on, in, in to the ground area\n<$A> Uhm it was on the edge of the grass just where the, the main curve is on the kerb It would have been in that area there It just, uhm, it 's somewhere round that area of the th' actual kerb where the turn in the kerb is there\n<$B> From speaking to the parties who gave evidence where did you believe the accident had taken place\n<$A> Uhm, that 's where I believe the accident did take place\n<$B> Did you take a statement from the defendant\n<$A> No I didn't, o I spoke to a witness that was at the scene, Mr McMillan\n<$B> Thank-you\n<$C> Constable, uhm, the reporting officer was Constable Callan Is that right\n<$A> That 's correct My Lord\n<$C> And he was in charge of investigating the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Is that right\n<$A> That 's correct My Lord\n<$C> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$A> That 's correct My Lord\n<$C> And, you say that uh you were present in the minor 's house after the accident\n<$A> That was later on, about twenty past ten that evening\n<$C> That 's uh September ninety-seven\n<$A> That 's correct My Lord yes\n<$C> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$C> And uhm do you have a notebook entry there, number seven Entry number seven\n<$A> Uhm I don't have everything that was said in my notebook obviously My Lord Uhm, as I say I spoke to certain people on that day and ascertained who had seen what in relation to the accident\n<$C> Do you have the notebook there\n<$A> I do have Yes,\n<$C> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the responsibility for the investigation of the facts fell on Constable Callan\n<$A> That would be correct He was in charge of investigating the accident I was just overseeing the investigation My Lord\n<$C> But it was your, you were involved in relation to the uh, possibility of prosecuting Mrs Hegarty for the assault\n<$A> No Constable Callan was involved in that as well My Lord\n<$C> Were you present uh during the investigation in relation to the assault\n<$A> I was yes That was the following day,\n<$C> And, I won't read all of it out, but it 's fair to say that you 've dedicated a page and a half to tell setting out the details, the nature of the assault, who was struck on what part of the body, <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Is that correct\n<$A> That 's correct My Lord Yes\n<$C> And then preceding that, you have got a paragraph which says, informed of RTA, of injury RTA, Springhill Park where girl knocked off bicycle <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> offending vehicle alleged to have drove off, eight eight DL o nine six seven, uh Cavalier uh, <unclear> several sylls </unclear>, injured party, uh believed a minor, Thomas Sean Maguire That 's your entry as regards your initial knowledge of the accident Is that right\n<$A> That 's correct My Lord Yes\n<$C> And, obviously the report which came into the police station was to that effect, that the child had been knocked off the bicycle and was then taken to the hospital That was what you had in your mind that you wanted to investigate Is that right\n<$A> That 's correct My Lord Yes\n<$C> And thereafter then you dedicate some detail to what you saw as regards the assault

{"text": "<Resignation query 1>\n\n\n<$Y>  Derek McDowell of Labour asked Mr Russell how he had come to his conclusion that became included in Mr Whelehan 's report to the Government that there was nothing to suggest that Father Smyth 's offences were continuing or were likely to continue either here or in Northern Ireland \n<$A> Because the facts given to us by the United Kingdom authorities showed, that the offences had ceased, in periods or at periods ranging from twenty-two years to six years previously The offences had been committed in regard to a single extended family They did not involve strangers, and they had ceased six years before\n<$B> There there seemed to be a suggestion, it doesn't appear in that paragraph, but there seemed to be a suggestion that because uh Father Smyth was then resident in County Cavan in a monastery in County Cavan that uh he therefore felt that it was  less urgent as well <unclear> several sylls </unclear>,\n<$A> Yes, that 's there also\n<$B> Uhm why did you conclude that\n<$A> Why did I\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Because, although I know nothing about Kilnacrott Abbey, the title, suggests to me a closed institution, or an institution where the people uh who uh reside there are not, are not at large to to to  use to use, I 'm sure if I if I paused longer I could think of a better expression than that but uh to I would distinguish uh uh uh clergymen who live in an abbey or a monastery uh from clergymen who live in the community That is my point\n<$B> Right You see   it has given rise to some comment that because of the fact that he was a priest that you felt it was less urgent\n<$A> No uhm, I knew he was a priest apart from his address because the information given to us said so I was not relying on the address for that for that uh for that point I thought in fact he was a monk, since he lived in an abbey\n<$Y>  Deputy Michael McDowell of the Progressive Democrats came back to the issue of the RUC 's interview notes which record Father Brendan Smyth 's admission of guilt for certain offences \n<$C> Were the notes taken by the RUC officers which you refer to and distinguish from a confession, were they uh detailed notes of interviews by those officers with Father Smyth\n<$A> I have no idea\n<$C> Have you ever seen them\n<$A> No,\n<$C> Well does it follow from that that uhm that uh the nature of, the the confessional nature of the evidence that was available or referred to in the submission that was made to the Attorney General 's office, that uh no no-one was in a position in the Attorney General 's office to, to work out from the papers that were submitted to them  uhm to what extent these were sketchy admissions or detailed admissions made to the RUC officers\n<$A> I think that would be a a a fair statement of the situation\n<$C> Well doesn't it follow from that Mr Russell again, that if you were going to consider the issue of delay that the recollection of Father Smyth and the detail of his confession if there was a confession made, would be central to a decision as to whether uh time, the elapse of time or delay had uh prejudiced uhm uh would or could prejudice uh uhm him in a way that would make him unfair to extradite him\n<$A> The work I was doing in the Smyth case was attempting to identify from the, I think I could fairly say almost multitude of reported previous decisions of the courts to identify some principles or common threads which could be applied once they had been identified to the facts of the Smyth case   with a view  with a view to finding an answer to the request for extradition\n<$C>  I appreciate that  \n<$C> Yes but uh I 'm asking you uh and I think it 's a fair point, and not a lawyer 's point only, that in order to arrive at a decision as to whether or not someone was prejudiced by the delay the very first thing you would have had to put your mind to was in the  in the context of admissions, the quality and the nature and the detail of those admissions\n<$A> Well first I think it would be necessary to discover whether the courts regarded admissions in such a case as of major significance in deciding whether twenty-nine years was too long an interval of time\n<$C> Well I appreciate the the the that uh legal research could go on at one hand but I 'm suggesting to you that the nature of the admissions was something which you would uh have uhm uh oh very, it would be something to which you would attach very heavy weight indeed, because if if these were a flowing account of abusing uh  children in this family in West Belfast uh in which in which uh there was full and frank disclosure, it could hardly be that the that the man could then say but I am prejudiced now uh by by the elapse of time since he wouldn't be in a position to deny it if the if the admissions were were were quoted\n<$A> The courts have held in some cases that mere elapse of time without any demonstration of prejudice to the wanted person is enough to prohibit a trial\n<$C> I can appreciate that but I 'm I 'm I 'm saying in this context I don't I don't, certainly I can't recollect any cases which uhm which tend to suggest that uhm that a court would regard uhm the issue of admission or no admission uh as not being the central issue on the question of delay\n<$A> Well are you aware I would, I am or perhaps you could tell me whether you are aware of any case in which in which the court has decided that that is the situation\n<$C> No because because I don't believe that anybody , and as if the Deputies if the Deputies would listen I don't I 'm not aware of any case where somebody, I 'm not aware of any case where somebody who has admitted to a series of sexual offences has ever uh come to a court and said but it 's too late now\n<$Y>  Mr Russell agreed with Deputy McDowell that the Smyth case could have been dealt with in twenty-one days by someone who had no other work to do He also agreed that the substantive cause of delay was due to administrative overload in his office and not to the novelty and complexity of the case \n<$A> The legal point was important and novel, and it  struck me that it was the sort of matter which I should deal with, by reason of its novelty and importance\n<$C> Yes but is it not the case that the, the vast the vast bulk of the delay that occurred in this case must be attributed not to the complexity of the point which you decided to deal with personally but to your other duties   which  distracted you from that\n<$A>  Yes indeed  , Certainly\n<$C> And uhm I have to suggest to you that uh in that context uh it uhm to say that uh to give to render as an excuse in public, which you didn't, but others have done that uh that this was the first case in which delay had  has arisen uh didn't do justice to the situation because the the the the the  the the substantive cause of the delay was uhm the uh the uh administrative overload on you and your officers\n<$A> Well uhm certainly the huge volume of work which has to be done in the Attorney General 's office was a a very very significant factor in accounting   for the delay \n<$C>  But it was the    it was the predominant cause in terms of time of the delay isn't that right\n<$A> I think probably that is the case\n<$Y>  When questioned by Deputy Eamon Gilmore of Democratic Left Mr Russell repeated that the Smyth case was indeed an exceptional case in that it raised an exceptionally difficult point of law \n<$D> Did you at any time uhm mention the case to the Attorney General\n<$A> No\n<$D> Why if it was an exceptional case did you not mention it to the Attorney General\n<$A> Because if I 'd told the Attorney General, there is a case which has come in which raises an exceptional point of law of great difficulty, there was every chance he 'd say to me what 's the answer, to to the question and I wouldn't be able to tell him That sort of conversation with an Attorney General is a fruitless one \n<$Y>  Deputy Gilmore later said he was surprised that Mr Russell could have had various discussions with the Attorney General about extradition matters generally and extradition legislation in particular without mentioning one exceptionally difficult case, namely the Father Brendan Smyth case \n<$A> I 'm not at all surprised\n<$D> Well I, I 'll put it to you Mr Russell that uhm the average citizen may well be surprised that uh here the is the uhm officer who has statutory responsibility for extradition, the officer of his office who has the sole responsibility for dealing with it, having a number of conversations and discussions about extradition, you have a problematic case and you never mention it to him\n<$A> The discussions were as I say on the legislation, the particular case, involving this particularly difficult question of law as I saw it and as I still see it, was not relevant to the legislation If I raised the uhm fact that I had a difficult case on hands, he might very well have said to me,  well what is the solution to this case and as I 've said already I wasn't in a position to answer that question, therefore I didn't see much point in in raising it with him\n<$X> Yes\n<$Y>  Deputy Willie O'Dea opened his questions to Mr Russell by asking him how long he had been dealing with extradition law in the Attorney General 's office Mr Russell replied he thought that ten or fifteen years He agreed with Mr O'Dea that he was the official who deals with the vast majority of extradition cases Mr O'Dea then pursued a line of questioning on Mr Russell 's experience in the teaching of law \n<$E> Were you ever involved in the teaching of law\n<$A> I was\n<$E> In what capacity\n<$A> I  was a member of the staff of the Law School of Trinity College\n<$E> Uhm I 've been informed, please correct me if I 'm wrong, that you were actually a Reid Professor of Law at Trinity College   Is that correct \n<$A>  Yes I was  \n<$E> Uh what what, on what basis do Trinity College appoint somebody as Reid Professor\n<$A> I would like to think merit\n<$E> Yes\n<$E> What age were you at the time Uhm\n<$A> Uhm\n<$E> Roughly\n<$A> Thirty-three I think\n<$E> So, apart from uh Mrs Robinson you must have been one of the youngest  Reid Professors of of of criminal law at Trinity College\n<$Y>  Mr Russell agreed with Mr O'Dea that his client presented with a diametrically opposed view by two eminent lawyers would be left confused \n<$E> The fact that there was conflict between, conflict of legal opinion between yourself and Mr Fitzsimons was conveyed to the Taoiseach and the Government on Monday the fourteenth of November Uh isn't it natural that they would be confused since they 'd be in the same position as as as the client we 've just mentioned\n<$A> I I suppose so, yes\n<$E> So, in determining how the sub-section, should be should be applied uh in the Smyth case it it was and is your view very definite view that the Duggan case is not a conclusive precedent in fact not a precedent at all\n<$A> It 's not a precedent at all and it gives no assistance whatever in resolving the problem of the twenty-nine year case\n<$E> In fact you have described it as as, peripheral, unimportant, insignificant\n<$A> These words which are not intended to cast any   any any  aspersions on the work of the officer who dealt with that case are are accurate I think uh simply because the issue didn't arise in a three and a half year case uh there was another factor also in it uh which I 've mentioned in in in my statement uh, and uh the it was not necessary for the officer to deal with the question\n<$E>  Yes I accept that  \n<$E> Now in view of the doubt and confusion and conflicting legal opinion, uhm, wouldn't the Taoiseach and his ministers have been justified in seeking and waiting for a definitive view on the matter, before the Taoiseach goes in to address the Da/il\n<$A> Certainly if if if if the Government is ever confused about a a a legal question they should uhm clarify their minds before they embark on public utterances  that is if I may be permitted to appear to offer advice to the Government which of course is not my intention\n<$E> Advice is most welcome And uh it would be it would be wise to get that definitive opinion in writing wouldn't it\n<$A> Yes\n<$E> Uh in other words if the Taoiseach had simply gone into the Da/il on the Tuesday, knowing about the Duggan case, and referred to the matter in a simplified way that it was a precedent and that there was no need, uh that this explanation for the delay didn't carry any weight because the matter, the legal matter had been considered in depth before in the Duggan case, wouldn't he be misleading the Da/il in effect", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Resignation query 2>\n\n\n<$A> The impression being conveyed you see is that that he found the whole the whole of the situation very unpleasant because you were shouting at him and you were putting pressure on him Did you try to pressurise him to change his opinion\n<$B> Oh yes, I did I tried to get him to understand that the Duggan case was not a case of any significance whatever and that therefore it was not the bombshell which he appeared to think it was But I, I had to  I have to say, though I have great admiration for Mr Fitzsimons 's gifts and qualities, I have to say that I found him uhm somewhat unreceptive of the possibility that there might be another point of view \n<$X>  Earlier Mr O'Dea asked Mr Russell if his office had ever instructed Mr Owen Fitzsimons in an extradition case \n<$A> Has your office ever instructed Mr Fitzsimons\n<$B> I do not believe so\n<$A> Have you ever encountered or have you often encountered Mr Fitzsimons on the defence side  , in extradition  cases\n<$B>  I don't think   I I I I 'm, I don't think ever\n<$A> So there 's no, there 's no great evidence that Mr Fitzsimons 's knowledge or at least his experience in extradition law in any way approximates to yours\n<$B> Well Mr Fitzsimons is a very distinguished uh practitioner but I think his interests lie in the Chancery field and European Law\n<$X>  When supplementary questions were put in the afternoon Donal Carey of Fine Gael asked if additional staff had been sought by the Attorney General 's office at any time Mr Russell said there had been an increase in staff \n<$C> Over the periods uh that this uh Smyth file was being considered,  how did you work on holidays or what were the holiday arrangements in the in the uh, in the office I I I heard for instance in the , the Taoiseach in one of his replies to the Da/il uh saying that one of the officials was in the East Europe and couldn't be contacted How was it, how, how are uh uh holidays arranged in the Attorney General 's office, or what what system have you Is it a, a fifty-two week office or is it uh, does it close down, or what happens\n<$A> No uhm it doesn't close down except at night and  at weekends Uh there 's always there, there always have to be staff there\n<$X>  Derek McDowell pressed Mr Russell on the Ellis case Mr Russell said there could be no question of that case deciding the Smyth case \n<$D> What exceptional circumstances did you see in the Smyth case\n<$B> Well, that was one of the issues, because before the Attorney General could authorise uh an extradition, he would have to be satisfied that there were exceptional circumstances Now the Oireachtas has given no guidance as to what it thought it meant when it inserted this provision in nineteen eighty-seven Nor have, uh nor is there uh much assistance from the courts, and therefore it was a matter of trying to decide would there be in the Smyth case any matters which a court would be likely to hold were exceptional circumstances\n<$D> And do you have a view on that\n<$B> I had not, I had not formulated a view because as I 've uh made it plain, I I hope, I had not come to a conclusion about the Smyth case At the time we were informed he was returning voluntarily to to Northern Ireland\n<$X>  Michael McDowell of the Progressive Democrats pressed Mr Russell on whether or not he was willing to be questioned on the substance of the statement of fact in the Smyth case \n<$B> I repeat, I awaited direction from the Attorney General on the matter\n<$X>  Later Mr McDowell asked Mr Russell if he was acquainted with Kilnacrott Abbey \n<$E> You you mentioned this morning that you weren't aware of a secondary school at Kilnacrott I 've since learnt that a Deputy in this House of reasonably young vintage was educated there uh at the secondary school Could I ask you, are you acquainted with Kilnacrott uh Abbey\n<$B> No\n<$E> At all\n<$B> No\n<$E> Uh are you acquainted with the uh or have you ever any, had any acquaintance or ever met the uh Abbott of Kilnacrott for the time being\n<$B> No and I don't think I 've ever met even a humble monk from that institution \n<$E> Well the reason the reason I ask you is that uh apparently he was he 's chaplain to a to a to to a uh an organisation in Dublin and I was wondering uhm could you have met him in that context\n<$B> What what organisation\n<$E> The Order of Saint Lazarus\n<$B> No I regret to say I 'm not a member or that organisation either \n<$X>  Tony Gregory raised the matter of the allegation that the former Taoiseach Mr Reynolds sought the removal of Mr Russell from his position in the Attorney General 's office \n<$F> Can I ask you then to just for the record, were you prepared to to leave your position in the Attorney General 's office as a result of the message that had come from the Taoiseach\n<$B> Certainly I was aware of no reason whatever why I should and I still haven't been made aware of any reason why I should\n<$F> I I accept that you 've said that but can you answer the question that I that I 've asked, which is you know were you prepared, uh the other I 'm, I don't wish to press you on it other than the implication in this document which has been circulated to us is that you were prepared to go Uh, it, I feel also that the implication is there that you were prepared to go but only if you could go quietly   and  I 'm simply trying to uh to establish if that is the case is that a fair assessment of of, or a fair account of the exchange between yourself and Mr Fitzsimons\n<$B>  No  \n<$B> No I wasn't prepared to go, quietly or otherwise\n<$X>  Before the Committee adjourned Mr Russell said he wished to correct an answer which he gave to a question from Willie O'Dea in the

{"text": "<Revenue panel>\n\n\n<$A> Uhm thank-you uh Chairman Good morning Mr MacDomhnaill Uhm sorry to, have to drag you back out of retirement and I 'll be as quick as I can Uhm may I ask you Mr MacDomhnaill uh whether you think the time has come for uhm a a modern Revenue Act,\n<$B> Uhm, separate from all the Finance Acts and uhm, certainly it 's it 's uh something which should be given serious consideration Uhm I would think that uh one very important thing which we as Commissioners have enjoyed right from the beginning is a very strong degree of independence in carrying out our functions And I would hope that any sort of uhm structure that would be set up set up would preserve that independence Uhm\n<$A> I think that 's important but I think the the reason the the the matter springs to mind is, and whether the Committee should recommend that there ought to be a new Revenue Act is the explanation that you gave the chairman yesterday, uhm you know, as to the background of the Commissioners that stems from nineteen twenty-three recommendations as I understand it, uh regularised by the nineteen thirty-four Act Uh and you know in nineteen ninety-nine that seems very outdated uh  and uh perhaps in need of revision\n<$B> Uhm, well the fundamental thing that you would be asking yourself is, what particular change you might have in mind Because it does have statutory authority at the moment Admittedly it 's spread out over a lot of legislation and going right back to the very foundation of the State uhm, even before the Ministers ' and Secretaries ' Act Uh, so if you were going to draw up uhm a Revenue Act, it would probably be time when you would have to consider uhm the type of structure that you had in mind Uh were you still going to preserve a Board of Commissioners independent if you like in the implementation process\n<$A> Well you see, one of the reasons that causes me to , uh prompts me to ask the question that, uh, the Board of the Commissioners itself seems to be a somewhat nebulous uh concept I mean you explained yesterday uh to the chairman uh and I quote uhm, uh you were explaining that 's the way the board functions quote I say the board in the sense that we use it in Revenue, as a short, as a sort, as a sort of short-cut term for any member, any Revenue Commissioner , I 'd have to put it to you Mr MacDomhnaill that I think most members of the public uh felt that there was uhm you know a modern cohesive uh integrated board functioning at the top of the Revenue Commissioners and that it had a chief executive, somebody who had manifestly uh you know the number one responsibility Now, talk to you about the changes and I know you 've made a lot of changes yourself But, that doesn't seem to be an accurate picture from what we 've learned in the course of these hearings\n<$B> I think uhm, there is a modern board I would like to think that the board that we had uh during my chairmanship was uh fitted  description of a modern board with a corporate plan, with regular meetings evaluating that plan But\n<$A> But is it not uh uh uh uh, you know where we left off evidence with Mr Curran and and so on I mean, at that point and prior to your becoming chairman, we established, did we not, that there were no regular board meetings, there was no agenda, there are no minutes, and it was difficult to establish, Mr Curran certainly seemed to have the view that the chairman was <&Latin> primus inter pares </&Latin>\n<$B> That would be correct He was the Chief Executive, he had the accountability uh to the Public Accounts Committee and indeed to the Minister Uhm what we, in recent times we have, I mean with strategic management and all that, we have a regular, I should say we now I 'm retired for over a year uh I think you 'll excuse that lapse if I use uh that terminology, that Revenue uh has uh a formal board meeting, that there are regular minutes and plans This board actually is very much integrated now into the management of the organisation But you have to make a distinction between the management of the organisation and the execution of certain statutory functions which are governed by legislation And as I explained yesterday, that just doesn't apply to the Commissioners That applies to various officers uh set up under the Customs and Excise legislation I think, that responsibilities and authorities are given by statute Now   it 's only  in that context in the context of the statutory functions, those functions which have to be done by the Board that you have Commissioners with identified areas of responsibility They will make the orders Of course that changes with the Commissioners\n<$A>  But it  \n<$A> But in terms of making orders and I don't want to dwell on this point too long, uh Mr MacDomhnaill but you know we seem to be reaching a conclusion uhm you know informally in this committee that uh it 's an area that we will have to look at In terms of making orders, I mean isn't it extraordinary that we have now progressed as far as yourself, the former chairman and we still don't know who originated SIM two six three Now uh is that fair to   us,  That here we have been here for I can't remember now eight or nine days, and a simple question about who originated SIM two six three, we can't get an answer\n<$B>  Well I think that  \n<$B> Well it came up now the evidence given was that a former Principal Inspector uhm, Mr Brown, was the inspector who put that together It 's not actually\n<$A> I I don't think we quite got that I I I think we we we got an opinion that it might have been the   gentleman who 's now deceased  But I mean, can I ask you the question like I mean who was it, you 're, you 're the former chairman\n<$B>  Well from what <unclear> several sylls </unclear> I might say  \n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Who who did originate it\n<$B> Well, as I say, I thought now from the evidence that this is within the Chief Inspector 's uh office, that Mr Brown or somebody in his, under him, would have been the person to do it\n<$A> And and his job again remind me was what\n<$B> Now uh income tax technical services And and part of that\n<$A> What what does income tax technical services mean\n<$B> Well, it it meant that difficult problems might come up in relation to the , the actual implementation of any section on the income tax side right across the country, they will research it and give a view And they would also uh back up uh legislation or suggest\n<$A> But this was a fairly big decision to defer a section of the Act effectively I mean could   somebody in that position make that decision \n<$B>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$B> Yeah I think if you will look at the the the SIM in question, most of it is drawn completely from the legislation It 's simply setting out uh what the Chief Inspector 's branch considered had to be done under the legislation by Chief Inspector staff There would have been other instructions sent out in the Collector General 's area because it was a Collector General function as well Now the actual, I can understand how a holding clause would be put in, in relation to the examination of the forms because what you have to make up your mind, I 'm just saying conjecture, uhm what you have to make up your mind about is, are you going to do this centrally, or is is it going to be something which will be uh something for District Inspectors only to to, uhm or will it be a matter to be dealt with in, inquiry branch or investigation branch All that would  have to be gone into That 's what I imagine would justify any holding operation Why it , it didn't, it what seemed to be a temporary holding operation became an almost uh permanent moratorium I don't understand, I I don't know, I can't give any direct evidence about that\n<$A> Well you see, when we talk about a Chief Executive and a modern management system, in the Revenue, I mean isn't it extraordinary that uhm, you know you haven't referred to yourself as the Chief Executive in the exchanges that we 've we 've just had But I mean isn't it extraordinary that such a, that in such an important matter that as Chief Executive you don't know\n<$B> But I wasn't Chief Executive at this particular time\n<$A> You were Chief Executive very shortly after it You were Commissioner from eighty-seven   you  have been Commissioner since nineteen ninety, uh for twelve years this has been put in abeyance\n<$B>  Yes  But I <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> say that  \n<$C> Chairman from nineteen ninety\n<$A> Chairman from nineteen ninety and for twelve years this has been put in abeyance It still is in abeyance Uh and and uh you can't tell me why\n<$B> Well, I suppose uhm, I could put it this way, there are eight stacks of these instructions,  covering all manner of actions that have to be taken, right through from uh auditing to straightforward things which I mentioned yesterday like new uh computer, changes required by enhancements in the computer function So there 's all manner of instructions and things have to be delegated very substantially If I if I as chairman   was still  doing what I was\n<$A>  But  \n<$A> But were you completely unaware of the manifest unrest among some of your own staff about this having been put in abeyance and never revoked\n<$B> I was\n<$A> You were completely unaware of that\n<$B> No I I\n<$A> I mean what are the reporting links   in the Revenue  How does that kind of thing get up as far as you as chairman\n<$B>  No I I forgot I forgot to put in  \n<$C> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> you asked the question Were you completely unaware of it\n<$B> I have I have to uh qualify that that by saying that it is mentioned in Mr Moriarty 's document, but it it carries the rider that it 's not much use to implementing that without other uhm powers to go to\n<$A> And is Mr Moriarty 's paper the only formal notification Do you talk to any of the people down the line\n<$B> Oh I I certainly do and I have regular meetings but as I say, the the, as chairman you 're largely concerned with management issues, with a huge resource, six thousand staff, you 've a changing agenda of legislation, you 've interaction with the other Commissioners on what 's unfolding, and as chairman uh, you can't be doing what you would do if you were uh an Assistant Secretary, you can't be doing what you would do, and things have to be delegated\n<$A> All right Did you know uhm Mr MacDomhnaill that in the annual report uh published on the thirty-first of December, the annual report for the thirty-first of December nineteen eighty-six, paragraph a hundred and thirty-three, reads as follows, of the official Revenue Commissioners ' report,  an inspector may require a deposit-taker to make available for inspection all declarations by non-residents   did you know that was in the official report\n<$B> Well uh, it 's a long time I mean I, I would have read the report at the time\n<$A> But I mean it seems to, you know suggest to us members of the public that a deposit, a deposit-taker would be required to do precisely that when in fact it had been put in abeyance\n<$B> Yeah well, I I would take that interpretation myself   So as  I say, when I  when when\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>   ought our attention not have been drawn to the existence of SMI two six three and that this was for the moment put on ice\n<$B> Uhm, as I say, that is if there was a a consciousness of that, I think that 's a good point   But uhm \n<$A>  Okay  \n<$A> Can I go back without labouring the point uh Mr uh MacDomhnaill uhm to your evidence to the chairman yesterday uh about the matter in the  in the report of the Comptroller Auditor General in respect of which uh you gave uh I won't put it stronger than inaccurate uhm, uh inaccurate account to the Public Accounts Committee and uh to the C and AG, uh or to the Accounts Committee and uh corrected it in the C and AG uh report Uh I 'm referring to the phrase,  in nineteen ninety-one we approached all the financial institutions on the basis of our own analysis of the movement in accounts  Now, you cleared that up with the chairman yesterday that, that was wrong And you acknowledged the significance of it given the position taken up since by Allied Irish Banks But isn't there another area in which it is significant", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "33ed5787-fbfe-4340-b60e-d24027947ad8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.300236+00:00"}
{"text": "<Resignation query 3>\n\n\n<$A> But wasn't that the legal point What the significance, whether the first case was significant, uh in the in the context of of considering the application of the relevant subsection in the second case Wasn't that the, wasn't that the  legal point at issue\n<$B> No The the the the the point at issue was whether or not the report had misled the Taoiseach and the government in fact by referring to one case only because as I stated earlier, the the, the argument, the the edifice of the argument that explained the seven-months delay commenced with the proposition that here was this brand new section that had never been considered before, and here was this extraordinary case with a long delay and because of the confluence of these events that this issue had to be addressed for the very first time and that a very long time effectively was needed for it And that was the clear impression that in my view was intended to be given by the report, intended to be given by the report to the government and uh once the Duggan case turned up it was clear that that was   flawed,  And when of course later the four other cases turned up with uh opinions from Senior Counsel on the section it meant that the uh uh, well the the the explanation that was given was, very very seriously misleading indeed And I won't put it, I won't use any stronger language than that\n<$A>  But  \n<$A> But wasn't there a very very serious conflict uh  of opinion in your office as to the significance of the Duggan case and whether in fact that report was or was not misleading\n<$B> Uh initially when I, this issue arose, it happened very quickly before I went up to the meeting and Mr uh Official A expressed some disagreement, later on that afternoon, as I said there was a very strong dispute between us in the office, Mr Official A was uh shouting at me in the course of that in my office and it was uh very unpleasant indeed, I can assure you There was a great deal of pressure being uh put on me but insofar as I was concerned uh at that time Official A had an interest Uh the wording used in the final report that the Attorney General produced on this issue was his wording, was his wording, and it was his information which Mr Whelehan used   and uh  uh insofar as I was concerned uh, we were approaching this issue from , different viewpoints I should say also that in the court course of that dispute in which I tried to argue out my, tried to argue out my position with him, I pointed to the fact that uh the section had two requirements, lapse of time and prejudice and officially contradicted me uh very violently and and in a very blunt fashion And uh when we conducted the search later of the other cases, I was uh very interested to find a memo from Official A to the Attorney General on the section pointing out expressly to the Attorney General who was to read that memo at the time, that the memo had two requirements, or that the section had two requirements which had to be met So uh, uhm well need I say any more on that topic\n<$B>  Mm hm  \n<$A> But didn't, didn't uh Mr Whelehan subsequently write a letter in which he seemed, he he he seemed to to indicate agreement with Official A 's opinion in that matter\n<$B> Uh Mr Whelehan, you 're talking about the letter that Mr Whelehan gave me, Uhm, Mr Whelehan wrote that letter uh I think in fairness to him uh just think of the situation in which he found himself On Monday night he had been, an emissary of the Government The Attorney General had come out and given him this information, asked him to consider his position, asked him to in any event put back his uh, uh swearing in by a couple of days He declined uh and he was coming in the next morning uh with me in the court to be sworn in, he dictated this letter and made this case I respect it of course uh I mean I disagree with his views He simply said, he told me he was giving me this letter to put it on the record but he certainly hadn't considered in detail the Duggan case and uh, well he he, he he he wrote this note uh and I don't accept, I do not accept that Mr Whelehan would have taken the line that Mr uh, that that the Official A would have taken\n<$C> Could I just interrupt for a second And as I did earlier indicate, it is in order to refer to the officials by name\n<$B> Ah very well Thank-you Mr Chairman Uh that uh Mr Russell uh would take and whilst he made a sort of a case for the record to me I accepted it as that but I was not, I , I disagreed with it uh fundamentally and uh, uh that basically is the position Now uh that letter was to me, it was a personal letter to me, it wasn't a letter uh that was addressed to anybody else The ministers, it wasn't a letter addressed to the ministers uh unless Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn read it uh between twelve o'clock the next day and I didn't see her reading that letter, she didn't know about its content, so it did not influence any of the events that occurred as I would understand it\n<$A> Yes but it does tend to to to to bear out uh the the Mr Russell 's opinion, as opposed to your own opinion I say that with respect If it 's the particularly if you look at paragraph four of the letter which states and I quote, according to what I said in the memorandum to the Taoiseach last week, after consulting with the official was quite accurate, where I stated that the section concerned had never been applied, never been applied prior to this case, and that the full consequences of the amendment had to be considered for the first time, that this case seemed to be, uh seemed to be, that this case seemed to be the person dealing with it to come well within what is contemplated by section fifty BBB of the relevant Act\n<$B> Well uh Mr Whelehan can deal with that matter himself I 've expressed my views on the section Mr Whelehan in his uh retirement uh letter statement uh stated that he uh, should have, uh his report should have referred to the Duggan case, and to my mind that is the best evidence uh on that issue There were two cases, uh the report was created this very strong impression to the uninitiated reader that this was the first time this issue ever rose And Mr Whelehan in his as I say his retirement statement has accepted fully that uh he uh should have referred to it Mr Russell uh notwithstanding the histrionics of the first day accepted in the office subsequently to me that he was wrong uh in certainly advising the Minister for Justice that this was the first case in which the question had been considered and he has presented, he presented later on a letter of apology in which he apologised to the government, to the Taoiseach, and to Mr Whelehan for misleading him uh in relation in relation to past cases So uh, so far as I 'm concerned on this issue Mr O'Dea uh the record speaks for itself Uh I quite appreciate that, in fact I 'm very surprised that an attempt should now be made for the first time to question uh the advice that I gave to the Government on that day because at no time until now, until you started questioning me, has anyone questioned the accuracy or the validity of the advice that I gave to the government on that day At no time So I I do not understand why uh this issue is being raised at this stage\n<$A> I I want to put it on clearly on record I 'm not questioning the validity or the accuracy of the advice you gave I 'm merely trying to emphasise that there was genuine legal disagreement at the time\n<$B> Mr O'Dea the issue for the ministers was whether there was one case or whether there were two cases The report that was furnished by the Attorney General to the previous Government was based upon, based the seven months ' delay or the explanation for it upon the proposition that there was only one case It was the very first time, very first time in any case that this section arose to be considered That was false as we now know False And in fact it was considered in five previous cases It so happens that the consideration in the Duggan case was fairly perfunctory, that is, true But it was a consideration that uh in the other cases that we discovered later it was uh considerably deeper\n<$A> How did the uh meeting on Monday, the first meeting on Monday conclude\n<$B> It    concluded , it concluded, it sort of broke up in I think some disorder as indeed all the meetings uh seemed to I was, given the impression that I was basically no longer wanted, that other things were going to be discussed, people walking in and out And I took my leave and   but  it was a pretty disorganised situation\n<$A>  What was the what was the was there any  \n<$A>  But  \n<$A> Yes I  I fully accept that Were you asked to go away and clarify the matter and come back with a more definitive report\n<$B> I uh I was I was I was never asked to prepare a definitive report Just like to make that absolutely clear At no stage And at no stage did I prepare a definitive report Had I been  requested to prepare a definitive report, of course I would have prepared one No question or doubt about it But uh there was one matter I certainly had to check and that was to see whether or not uh Mr Whelehan 's signature was on the uh page or the submission that,\n<$A> That was all you had to check\n<$B> That was, that was all I had to check at that stage and there was an analysis on the Duggan case that was being prepared\n<$A> Yeah Did you make any contemporaneous note of the meeting\n<$B> I did not make any  contemporaneous note of the meeting\n<$A> Well I have, I have circulated a contemporaneous note made at the meeting by one of the participants Deputy Michael Woods, Minister for Social Welfare And I 'll just read it into the record Monday fourteenth one pm Resume meeting with Taoiseach Fianna Fa/il ministers, new AG Eoghan Fitzsimons attends meeting and says he has found a previous case, Duggan, in brackets, in which nineteen eighty-seven Act was considered Not sure of all details, eg if signed by H Whelehan Only a preliminary notice Taoiseach and M G Quinn ask him to do a full investigation and report back as soon as possible What, what comment would you make on that\n<$B> Well I don't accept the accuracy of the final sentence Mr O'Dea I do not accept it And if I could explain further I 'll give you a reason why I don't accept it On Monday night the fifth of December, this is the night when I was requested to prepare a uh statement at the request of Mr Spring on the happenings of the fourteenth and fifteenth of November, uh I prepared that statement during the course of the afternoon I in fact phoned Mr Whelehan to check some, just to make sure that uhm, double check my recollections and did so and prepared a statement on uh accordingly Uh the statement was uh not to be released by me uh until uh permission was given by Mr Reynolds because he was still the Taoiseach Uh the statement was ultimately sent uh to Mr Reynolds in Budapest uh, uh that, evening I think it must have been about seven o'clock, uh incidentally a copy of it having been sent to a wrong fax number in Budapest uh to start with,     That number number was given to us by the Taoiseach 's department We didn't make that mistake But uh I was called uh later on that evening at about ten o'clock I was called to a meeting uh in the Taoiseach 's rooms or in that area The Taoiseach was not there Uh present were Mr Ahern, Doctor Woods, Mr Cann and Mr Dempsey came in later and\n<$A>  I 'm sure they were interested", "subdomain":

{"text": "<AG Cross exam>\n\n\n<$A> Uhm, no I I I was anxious to to discover how uh that uh conclusion was reached that this was the first case and with respect I don't think you 've answered it Maybe it 's a more appropriate one to put it to the official concerned Was it simply by by his uh uh memory I mean,   can I  can I just say, on your views on Mr Fitzsimons and I think this is relevant, uh uh regarding the running of your office, uh an office which you say you were you were in and I accept what you say, from eight a-m onwards every day but uh Mr Fitzsimons found that the procedures for the processing of extradition cases were seriously defective, that there was no way of checking similarity of details, no indexing system which would immediately provide a summary of the file or the nature of the issues covered by it I mean were you at any stage informed that there were difficulties when putting a serious question about a case which was to be brought to the government  for answer in the Da/il, that an official because of all of these difficulties and because of the uh Dickensian state of the  of the filing system at least in the office uh that, the official simply wouldn't be in a position Uh given your own argument that you couldn't recollect the case because of workload and so on, so how could this official be  expected to state categorically, facts, supposedly facts about a case which you then accepted as facts without question\n<$B>  Oh yeah <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>  \n<$B> Well I mean the the official would have to answer uh just how he went about getting together the information that enabled him to make that statement which turned out to be inaccurate He will he will answer that for you I 'm sure Uh I I don't know how but he he 'll answer the question and that 's a matter for him I think that 's   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  But what 's   your own understanding of the workings of your office and how decisions were taken   how conclusions were reached \n<$B>  Well there 's I 've, I 've no   difficulty about how decisions were taken I do take your point that that that the the facilities in the office for retrieving information uh by electronic means and by the use of computers and databases, that, that system is not there That infrastructure is not in the office and uh and and that does  undoubtedly hamper a search such as that which was carried out by Mr Russell at my request\n<$A> But did did you never uh see that as a difficulty up to this You you you were three years in the office\n<$B> Yes I 'd never had a difficulty, I 'd I 'd never uh had that difficulty or that lack of, the absence of such a retrievable system had never turned up a difficulty for me before Uhm uh and I, uh that 's all I can say uh,\n<$A> Can I ask a final question\n<$C> One final question yes <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>\n<$A> Can I go on Mr Whelehan to uhm the uh, you 've emphasised this morning that uh you you felt you had a majority of government supporting you Uh you don't seem uh, to attach any importance to the fact that you were uh dealing with a partnership government And  it seems to me that uhm, and I 'm trying to be objective as an independent I 've no axe to grind with anybody here, but it seems to me that the entire country was aware of the disquiet of the Labour section, the Labour partner in government about your uh proposed uh acceptance of of of the office, even to the extent that they they left government, they walked  they walked out of the Cabinet meeting Why in those circumstances, in that , and that was a fairly long-running uh context,  why did you persist and press ahead, knowing that the stability of the country and the , the stability of the   of the Government, was involved, was at stake Why did you press ahead with uh your uh seeking of this office\n<$B> Uh I I I, in a sense sought the office, I made myself available for the office and the Taoiseach indicated that he favoured the appointment and the position was that the majority of the Government favoured the appointment   No  \n<$A>  Do you mean sorry can I  , I don't wish to interrupt Chairman But when, you you 've  used this term on a number of occasions When you 're talking about uh a majority of the government are you talking about the Fianna Fa/il ministers\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> One partner   in a  partnership government\n<$B>  No but <[/1>  well  I wanted, I 'm talking about that, but I 'm talking about the fact that no other minister in the Government, that I can identify expressed to me any reservation or any suggestion that I would not be a satisfactory person to be appointed to that position Not one Ever So I, the only, the only influence that could have come to bear on me to declare that I was no longer interested would be newspaper reports attributed to the Ta/naiste uh and  some other members of the Labour party But not once uh sir did anybody suggest to me that I was unsuitable for high office, judicial office And it was said in some of these reports that I was a very good Attorney General and they hoped I 'd stay on as Attorney General, they 'd full confidence in me as Attorney General But for some reason I was unsuitable uh or there were reservations about my suitability for this office Now if such reservations existed I would think sir that it would be fair uh from any of the people who had reservations to come to me because on a personal level, I had the best of relations with them And I believe still, still would have the best of relations with them And I cannot understand to this day why none of them, whoever they were, came to me, the Ta/naiste or anybody else and looked me in the eye and said, look, we have a difficulty with you for the following reasons You , uh they could explain to me what the difficulty was, I would then of course consider it But uh a vague, campaign if you like or a vague uh repetition of reservations in the press I found absolutely uh abhorrent and it was something to which I would not respond\n<$A> But, uh while I accept your understanding that the uh, or your  inability to understand these reservations, surely it was clear to you that there was a serious difference between the two partners in government, that one partner wanted you You were in effect the political candidate for Fianna Fa/il in that sense The other partner in government, the Labour ministers did not want you Regardless of what the reservations were, it was clear to the entire country that they did not want you as President of the High Court and yet you persisted, regardless\n<$B> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$C> <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> can we Mr Whelehan just before you respond, I want to point out, this question has been asked on a number of occasions It 's repetitive and I don't want it to go any further now so this is the last response and I then uh that 's  concluding Deputy Gregory 's questions Your last response now and a brief response\n<$A> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> if I got an answer to it\n<$C> Well the question has been asked on a number of occasions and I did ask at the beginning, I did not want repetition in relation to the questions A brief reply now Mr Whelehan\n<$B> If I was acceptable as Attorney General uh and, to the to the government, uh I think that prima facie, holding that position I must be acceptable for appointment to high judicial office And I think it 'd be a very sad day for this country if there 's an Attorney General appointed to advise the government who does not have suitability to be appointed a Judge of the High Court\n<$A> When did you acquire    acceptable <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$C>  And that concludes Deputy Gregory 's   questions now Sorry I now call on Deputy Willie O'Dea Fianna Fa/il to put his questions to Mr Whelehan\n<$D> Thank-you Mr Chairman First of all I want to thank you for your attendance here today Uhm when did the Smyth case first come to your attention,\n<$B> I 'm almost certain that the first time I became aware of the Smyth case was in a report in, the Sunday Independent of it would have been, if my days and dates are correct, the Sunday before the twenty-fifth of October That 'd be Sunday the twenty-third of October uh and there was a large expose/-type front page uhm article on the subject under the by-line of, a journalist, whose name was, I think, Veronica Guerin\n<$D> Right There was no way you could have known about the Smyth case prior to that\n<$B> No\n<$D> Because because the file was in the exclusive possession of Mr Russell\n<$B> Correct\n<$D> Uhm so therefore uh can I take it as logically following from that that nobody else, for example no member of the Government could have known about it\n<$B> No\n<$D> Yeah So therefore certain reports that appeared in certain sections of the media to the effect that the reason for the seven-month delay was that Fianna Fa/il ministers were trying to shelter a paedophile Those reports, you 'd accept that those reports must be completely without foundation\n<$B> Yes\n<$D> You state uhm you 've stated in the preamble to your evidence today that you weren't greatly surprised that the Taoiseach didn't mention the Duggan case in his Tuesday speech Why was that\n<$B> That was because I had given a very clear account to Mr Fitzsimons spontaneously when he when he reminded me of the Duggan case, A, that the Duggan case was very much in ease of the allegations I 'm sorry Mr Chairman I 'm repeating this answer but it 's,  in a sense the question is a repeat of a question I 've been asked The the emergence of the Duggan file gave the lie to the idea that there would be protection afforded to somebody because they were a Catholic clergyman in the office, and secondly, that the Duggan case did not require uh anything like an in-depth study of the extent or possible application of section fifty uh, of the Extradition Act nineteen eighty-seven The the the Duggan case was a case where, as I think Mr Fitzsimons himself put it, had a perfunctory or casual or trivial or passing uh reference to the section, it did not involve a detailed consideration of the section\n<$D> Uhm, you are aware that there was difference of opinion, quite strong difference of opinion between Mr Russell in your office and the new Attorney General,  Mr Fitzsimons on the exact relevance of the Duggan case Are you aware of that\n<$B> I wasn't aware of that until these   proceedings  But I mean I 'm I 'm I 'm taken by the fact that when I heard that   it 's, it 's, I don't know what significance it will have for the Committee but it seems to me that I in my own home on the Monday was taking very much the same view of the Duggan case as Mr Russell is supposed to have taken when he was talking with Mr Fitzsimons Uh and I gave that view uh uh without ever having had contact with Mr Russell about the Duggan case or the  or the Smyth case since I left the office Uh we both apparently on the same day on the Monday, in different locations, when told about the Duggan case by Mr Fitzsimons, came to broadly similar views as to its relevance\n<$D>  Yes  \n<$D> So therefore there was a difference of opinion, a fairly fundamental difference of opinion about the relevance of the Duggan case between Mr Fitzsimons on the one side and yourself and Mr Russell uh on the other side That would be a fair, a fair estimation   <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  Yes and when   I gave to Mr Fitzsimons my interpretation of the Duggan case and its its lack of relevance in the context of the Smyth case, he didn't uh, he didn't argue a different point of view with me And he took on board the two points which I made and he agreed that he would convey to the Taoiseach as I asked him to do, my attitude to the Duggan case, and I gave him a letter uh the following morning recounting what I had said to him, uh just for the record and I 'm very pleased that I did And that 's the letter which I read to you gentlemen uh this morning when the Committee first sat", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

moment Sarah Alright \n<$A> And then all the catalogues Malcolm\n<$B> Library books separated   <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>  Cassettes you think maybe Jenna might   be able to \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Maybe   Jenna 'll do the cassettes\n<$B> Maybe Jenna We 'll put it to her\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> And, those files\n<$A>  those files for uhm,   you know \n<$B>  Class   for me maybe\n<$A> For  yeah maybe And then I could look after the the general uhm tidying up of the of the resources room\n<$B> So, if I was to if I were to write that down, type it out and give it to Tony as a possible     as a, a He he said he wanted he wanted to know hours\n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> Right\n<$B> So how many hours would that involve do you think for each of us,   How many hours Like a week we could do hours \n<$A>  Well like at the at the beginning   it, at the beginning it might   be Uhm \n<$B>  Sorry Martine   That 'd be a lengthy process that inventory\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> The tidying up maybe, I don't know What is length What do you think per week\n<$A> What do you think\n<$B> I don't know I I think we can't give him a we can't really see but we could give him a, a minimum number of hours that we would be prepared to do in a week\n<$A> Right\n<$B> What do you think Three hours a week\n<$A> I 'll do four\n<$B> Four\n<$A> Yeah That 's a minimum,   for the  moment,   until we, if we 've to get maybe \n<$B>  Four hours  \n<$B>  Uh, I know   I spend hours doing materials Martine   I spend hours in \n<$A>  Well so do I Malcolm I spend   hours doing you   know  at being in here tidying up and doing all sorts of things\n<$B>  Yes  \n<$A> We can't speak for Jenna   whatever  you know she wants to do Maybe I I I could do four hours\n<$A>  No  \n<$A> Yeah, You know, two   hours one  afternoon Yeah easily\n<$B>  I could do  \n<$B> I do hours and hours before I go to start work\n<$A> That 's right\n<$B> Anyway,   that 's my own that 's  my own choice,   Uhm , that 'll be it That 's all   that, like I mean \n<$A>  In the mornings there when you come in  \n<$A>  Uhm  \n<$A>  Yeah, I could be   responsible   for for  the for the stationery renewing all the stationery and   stuff like that \n<$B>  Games  \n<$B>  Mm  , stationery \n<$A> What about these things here, Malcolm\n<$B> Huh\n<$A> What about all of this here\n<$B> Well they 're they were all  they were all uhm, they somebody started on those and it 's all very good But I mean is it finished I don't know\n<$A> But I think   they could be \n<$B>  And they 're not   used   I mean there should be,  an induction\n<$A>  They 're not used That 's what was in my  \n<$A> Yes\n<$B> Even for teachers who 've been here for years\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> Contracts and things Uhm, an induction you  for the future,   an  induction for teachers,\n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> Yes\n<$B> I remember I tried   we tried it before Remember we \n<$A>  And then   what we have to do then is Malcolm maybe get, put up lists\n<$B> Lists of what\n<$A> Of, what we have in the resources room exactly\n<$B> There used to be a list\n<$A> There used to be a list   but it 's gone \n<$B>  So   make list available\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> List  Okay but maybe a list, maybe a, mm, for who\n<$A> For the resources room\n<$B> Well it should be in the, library list\n<$A> Yes And then uhm, make a list out every week of books that are missing off the shelves\n<$B> So, yeah\n<$A> You know\n<$B> I mean\n<$A> I mean I 'm I 'm terribly guilty as well I take books   upstairs and \n<$B>  So do we   can see Me too\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> Uhm, okay But I mean some books aren't really used except, you know on the odd occasions whereas, others are in demand\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> You could uhm, one of us could be the teacher to whom other teachers go if they need, to know if they need a missing book and then the teacher could put out a\n<$A> Yes that 's what I mean by that That thinking\n<$B> But I mean if a teacher needs a book and it 's missing they could   go to  one teacher and then the teacher could be responsible for, enquiring who has it, you know\n<$A>  Oh right  \n<$A> Yes\n<$B> Something like that\n<$A> Yeah Would you like to do that\n<$B> No, not really Martine I don't   want anything \n<$A>  Say that   again If   if I \n<$B>  So if I   say I was looking for a book\n<$A> Say you have that   book there \n<$B>  So I could   yes I have that book and you 're looking for it   You  could do a wee ask a wee ask around a wee   informal  ask around but uh if it 's missing then, uhm\n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> Has to be replaced\n<$B> Reported anyway missing\n<$A> Reported yeah\n<$B> I don't know Ach no I don't know\n<$A> What did Tony say there about what does he want Headway\n<$B> Pre-Intermediate <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>   John knows John \n<$A>  So John had   John wrote it down did he Okay he 's to order it   So the big thing then the big thing  then is the uh what do you call it The big   thing is \n<$B>  That 's just fine with me  \n<$B>  Nobody uses   these files you see Martine\n<$A> That 's what I that 's that was my my uh\n<$B> I think these  these ESERP materials we could get rid of\n<$A> The ESERP stuff yeah,   yeah \n<$B>  They 're not   they 're not here anymore are they\n<$A> No I think they 're finished  , unless  they come back next year\n<$B>  So I  \n<$B> Is there a\n<$A> But there 's stuff there maybe stuff in   those that can be \n<$B>  Oh yeah   No I mean the files, to be   reused , but I mean in their present form\n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> This here I 'll leave cos that 's nothing to do with me, that, rubbish   there  Uh but uh\n<$A>  Yeah yeah  \n<$A> So what about all this EAP stuff that we 're supposed to get together\n<$B> I don't know anything about that Us\n<$A> Well if we 're going to be in the resources room\n<$B> Materials\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> What does that involve Martine Does that involve photocopying the book   Sure that 's a waste of time That 's \n<$A>  Yes and   it 's a waste of time Of course it 's a waste of time That 's what that 's all about there\n<$B> I could make EAP materials Develop EAP materials based   on  newspapers and, radio programmes and the internet\n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> That would be good\n<$B> Real,   stuff \n<$A>  Yes   real stuff\n<$B> I could I   mean I \n<$A>  Yeah That would   be good Malcolm That 's a good   idea \n<$B>  Including    well I don't know It I mean, you know,   that would make  more sense   That , wouldn't it\n<$A>  Yeah yes  \n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> Yip Actually that would be very good for you to do that from the point of   view of your, CV thing, go ahead \n<$B>  Mhm mhm  , but I mean uh   anyway  that would be, and some of these files are never used\n<$A>  Yes  \n<$A> Never used They 're there they 're there from the days of uhm, Maggie Lock\n<$B> They 're good They 're   fine \n<$A>  Yes   She 's got some good   things now \n<$B>  They 're great   I mean, but they 're never used which\n<$A> But what I find Malcolm is that the the teachers just go in and they do their own thing and they don't bother I do that\n<$B> We all do it to an extent", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Doctor and patient>\n\n\n<$A> Uh hello Mr McKenzie I 'm Doctor McMaster What can I do for you\n<$B> Well I 've been to uh to the doctor a few times with this problem Uh I was about about six months ago I was uh I, previously before that about two years when I was doing karate, I uh hurt my right leg  , well  I was trying I was trying to kick somebody I think it was Uh I heard a snap, uh underneath my leg uh, just about in there\n<$A>  Right  \n<$A> Uh how long ago did you say Two years\n<$B> Well, you see I was at a doctor six months ago It had been two years before that\n<$A> Right\n<$B> I I went, oh about six weeks after that as it was very painful Uh doctor told me that it was just a hamstring injury and that people basically got them all the time in sporting activity   and not to worry about it \n<$A>  Okay and   well uh what 's wrong with you now that you come up\n<$B> Well uh uh another, another six months it didn't get any better Uh I let it go and it started in colder weather possibly, it was very very sore uh walking up the street and what have you   It was \n<$A>  Your   knee or you leg\n<$B> Uh in the back of my leg\n<$A> Right\n<$B> It 's as if there 's some tendon running down uh underneath I don't know anything about it obviously but it 's I heard this big snap But I can't feel anything wrong with my leg\n<$A> That 's two years ago\n<$B> That 's two years ago I came back six months ago, uh and complained of the same uh injury I was sent to the sports clinic   Uh  I got I got in there Uhm, I was, didn't get any help basically at all  they seemed to ignore that I said snap And actually it was quite funny cos the physiotherapist told me that one of my legs was a centimetre shorter than the other one And she gave me a a bit of foam, white foam stuff to put in my shoe   She \n<$A>  Uh-huh  \n<$A>  Uh   who told you this\n<$B> It was one of the physiotherapists\n<$A> Which leg was shorter\n<$B> The right one And she said it was it was   I  it was actually a problem with my lower back It wasn't a problem with my leg   I tried to, pain in my leg \n<$A>  But I  \n<$A>  What was what was in   in your legs She said the pain in your leg was coming from your back   and that 's what she said \n<$B>  Yes she says   my my bottom back was very tight and that was the problem   And it wasn't my leg \n<$A>  You 've had the   pain now for two years haven't   you  And you were last seen six months ago\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Exactly   So she didn't really  understand that it it was actually I felt something snap in my leg   It wasn't in my lower back \n<$A>  What what  \n<$A>    what 's   actually wrong with you now that you 've come up today\n<$B> I occasionally feel the pain when I 'm running Or if I haven't exercised for a while   and I  playing a game of football or something I  uh get sharp pains uh in my legs\n<$A>  So  \n<$A> So is it is it getting worse or is just the fact that it hasn't gone away\n<$B> It just hasn't gone away and it 's always there, whenever I it 's uh The last time a few months a a  couple of weeks back, I was playing a game of football, and then I was just <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> in the last minute And I felt it the whole way through the game\n<$A> Right so it 's it 's it hasn't actually been getting worse the last couple of days\n<$B> No it 's it didn't get worse\n<$A> It 's just that it hasn't gone away   and you 're just concerned \n<$B>  It hasn't gone away   yeah\n<$A> Okay And it all started two years ago Nothing before then\n<$B> Nothing before that time I I actually heard the snap\n<$A> You 'd say it 's a sharp pain\n<$B> Yup It 's   very sharp \n<$A>  It is    where exactly is the pain\n<$B> Well it 's it 's it 's well above the hamstring It 's sort of it 's in there\n<$A> Is it at the back of your leg\n<$B> Yes at the very back of my leg\n<$A> Does it move at all\n<$B> It doesn't move no\n<$A> It just stay in one place\n<$B> Stays in the one   place \n<$A>  Does   it go down below the knee\n<$B> No\n<$A> Okay Is there any pain in your back at all\n<$B> No\n<$A> And any pain in your knee itself\n<$B> No pain\n<$A> And it 's all just in the back of your leg\n<$B> All at the   back of my leg \n<$A>  And   does it only come with movement or do you get it when you 're sitting down at rest\n<$B> If I had 've been exercising for a while and I was sitting I would feel it for a few weeks after exercising Yes   even sitting down , At times it would be constant and then at times I I forget about it or it wouldn't be   there,  But I 'm always aware of it   always \n<$A>  Right and is it constant  \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Okay   and uh does anything make it go away or anything make it worse\n<$B> Just as I say exercise makes it   you know <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  And is there any   way you can get rid of it\n<$B> Not exercising, not do anything with that leg after a while   til it totally disappears \n<$A>  And  , do you 've any pain anywhere else at all in the other leg\n<$B> No\n<$A> Back\n<$B> No\n<$A> Okay And no pain in your feet at all\n<$B> No\n<$A> Do you get any numbness at all or any   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  No  , Not at all Just one pain\n<$A> Any weakness in your legs\n<$B> No\n<$A> Uh does your leg ever give way from you\n<$B> No\n<$A> And you 've no difficulty walking upstairs\n<$B> No no\n<$A> Or coming down the stairs\n<$B> No\n<$A> Okay and how about bending over or standing up\n<$B> As a say uh uh possibly after exercising, you know I would feel it more bending over and what have you But normal as I am now no I never feel it\n<$A> None at all\n<$B> None at all\n<$A> And if you were to if you didn't do any exercise now, would it go away by itself\n<$B> It would go away   and  possibly in six months ' time I 'll feel it again I 'll say there 's   that pain again \n<$A>  Then  \n<$A>  Right   It 'll just come back on you again And when did you say it came on the last time\n<$B> Uh I was exercising a few weeks back\n<$A> Right so it 's really for the last few weeks you 've had a   problem  So you had it over the last two years on and off\n<$B>  Yes  \n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> And then six weeks ago it came or, a few weeks ago it came back again\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> And it 's really hasn't cleared up yet   You want to get  it checked out\n<$B>  Exactly  \n<$B> I 'd like to know\n<$A> And it 's a sharp pain, behind the right  leg and behind the right   thigh  Doesn't move anywhere\n<$B>  Aye  \n<$B> No\n<$A> You 've no pain in your back\n<$B> No\n<$A> No pains in the knee\n<$B> No\n<$A> No other problems at all\n<$B> Not at all\n<$A> You 're generally well\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Okay No other problems with your health\n<$B> No\n<$A> Any medication\n<$B> No medication\n<$A> Okay And you said a physio told you that your right leg was shorter\n<$B> Yeah She she measured up she seemed to ignore the fact that it was actually a pain in my leg   And I  uh the crux of the matter I think is I felt, I heard and felt something snap  , yet  she tried to tell me that uh it was the bother was at base of the back And she just kept kneading the base of my back until it was sore and telling me that that was the problem And   it wasn't \n<$A>  Uh-huh  \n<$A>  Uh-huh  \n<$A>  And she, you don't   actually believe her then\n<$B> No I don't believe her at   I 've no confidence  in going up to the sports clinic again\n<$A>  And <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  \n<$A> Uh-huh Have you worn it Have you used the foam that she gave you\n<$B> No I didn't\n<$A> Uh uh did you not try it at all\n<$B> I no I didn't\n<$A> Do you not think it 'd be worth trying\n<$B> I I I don't think so because uh, it I had never ever any trouble before this And then I heard the snap, and felt the snap, and I don't think uh now I don't I don't think that after all these years that suddenly\n<$A> Uh-huh Well I I would think that they should actually give it a, give it a try cos it  it 's certainly going to do no harm And if it did work at least then, uh, you know it 'd be something simple that would work   Okay  Can I 've a wee look at your knee\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Aye\n<$A> Just bend the knee right the way up for me Okay now just sit down again It 's alright Okay Bend the knee right the way back for me Okay bend it back to your, to touch the back of your thighs Just bend it down Bend it right the way back Now straighten it out for me Hold it out straight Now keep it straight Don't really bend it  keep it straight Now just relax the leg Let me take the weight of it Let me take the weight of it again Bend the knee down for me Okay are you sore anywhere round here\n<$B> No\n<$A> So the knee 's perfectly fine   or  Okay And just relax the leg now for me, How about that\n<$B>  Yup  \n<$B> It 's fine\n<$A> And turn it round here\n<$B> It 's fine\n<$A> Okay, now how about in here at the back\n<$B> That 's fine\n<$A> How about in here\n<$B> Fine\n<$A> Okay Are you tender there at all\n<$B> No\n<$A> How about up here\n<$B> No\n<$A> Can you just stand up for me Turn around a minute Right, point to where exactly it 's sore\n<$B> Well it is, some in there\n<$A> Okay Can you point it with one finger\n<$B> It 's  I can't really point it out now Mm, there\n<$A> Okay Yeah\n<$B> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Just bend forward for me Try and touch your toes Stand up again Lean right the way back and turn back Is that sore\n<$B> No\n<$A> No Twist down the side, down the other side Okay Now just stand straight for me again Just tell me if this hurts anywhere Did she find the physio  therapist find a sore place in your back\n<$B> No She just said it was tight She actually made it sore by sticking her her thumbs in it which isn't I mean here 's what she done\n<$A> I I think you must 've uh, pulled one of the hamstring 's muscles And, what 's happened is whenever you heard the snap it was probably just a few fibres and uh, <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> You haven't actually broken the whole hamstring muscle, Uh it 's just going to be a sprain And the problem with it is that unless you don't  exercise properly it 's not going to heal up, and you 're going to be left with a weak knee Uhm, uh whenever you 're in go and do some uh excessive exercise you 're just going to bring it on again So what you need to do is do uh gradual exercise to build it up, to full strength again I think if you if you do that build it up gradually it will take over from the weakness\n<$B> Yup\n<$A> And then  once you start getting full exercise you won't have any difficulty with it",

And is this is it the is uh, uh exhibition moving on somewhere or is it   it 's just staying here at Queen 's \n<$A>  No well there   there 's uhm  I 'm not too sure whether it 's been extended   here , uh due to popular demand It 's meant to finish in April   But it 's been  extended to June So uhm whether it moves on to maybe Armagh   Museum  I 'm not too  That 's the sister museum of   ours  Uhm I don't know whether you know a smaller version of it, will move down there But because of the a lot of the exhibits are loan, uhm exhibits then, I 'm not too sure whether it will   be travelling \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  I seen that  \n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  I didn't   I didn't know Armagh was the   sister museum \n<$A>  Yeah it   is Uh-huh it is   It 's part of  it 's uh it 's part of the Ulster Museum   It 's  uhm you know funded by us   and  uh, you know there 's a separate  uh curator uhm down there but uhm\n<$B>  Oh very good  \n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  Right  \n<$B> What about uhm what about this the big, uh dinosaur collection youse had on there I seen a lot of that\n<$A> Dinosaurs Alive   Oh yes that 's \n<$B>  Yeah yeah   Is that uh when did that, was that years ago\n<$A> Uhm two years ago   actually Two years ago yeah It was \n<$B>  Two years ago yeah I remember there   was a lot of noise made at the at the   review yeah \n<$A>   Oh there was   yeah it was a very good   exhibition It 's  uhm you know, it 's it 's a travelling one as   well  You know it 's goes all round you know Britain and   that, And uh \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  Yeah yeah for it was   it was very good now Was very good\n<$A> It was a good one\n<$B> So   have you \n<$A>  So is there   anything else you wanted to know about\n<$B> Is there anything else, uhm that 's coming anything which I 'm   interested in \n<$A>  Uhm we 've got  , a big football exhibition coming   up  in uhm June   Uhm it 's  uh  it 's to do with uh a hundred years of Association Football But there 's   also going to  be exhibits on the World Cup and,   you know a lot of  uhm ex I think there 's going to be you know you know football shirts and you   know things  to do And   there 's a big photography , uhm part of it as well\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Brilliant  \n<$B>  Very good  \n<$B>  Oh right yeah  \n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  Oh that 'll be very good  \n<$B> I see\n<$A> And uh it should be,   uhm like  the dinosaurs there 's going to be a big activity area you know for kids you know so they can you know come not only and just look at the exhibition,   but uhm  you know, to look you know there 's activities   going  on to do with football   Uhm \n<$B>  Is this uh  \n<$B>  Mhm  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  That 's very   good Is it Northern Ireland, Football Association has something to do   with this \n<$A>  Uhm yeah the   Well there it 's really yeah it would be, based on them, but uhm there 's other you know exhibits as well from other clubs in over you know in uh England\n<$B> Football clubs\n<$A> Football   clubs  yeah\n<$B>  Very   good   Very good \n<$A>  Hopefully   anyway I 'm not too I 'm not totally sure but I think that 's the way it 's,   it 's leading \n<$B>  When  , sorry when uh when is uh, this starting this,   on \n<$A>  June  ,   June  the let 's see June the seventeenth   It 's running right  through to January,   next year \n<$B>  June  \n<$B>  Right this is <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>  \n<$B>  Is that I think   that might be the start of the World Cup,   the very day the World  Cup starts\n<$A>  Mhm mhm  \n<$A> Is that is that the day it   starts Right \n<$B>  Yeah I think   it is It 's the fifteenth or the seventeenth\n<$A> Uh-huh\n<$B> Very good Very good\n<$A> So that 's what that 's the big one for the summer   anyway \n<$B>  I think   I think it 's a nice change to have something like that   something relevant \n<$A>  Mm well   this is the first time a football   exhibition 's  actually been actually has been done, in the museum before So it 's sort of like a first, for us\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> I think that 's a good idea too cos it 'll start bringing in some young people   into the museum whereas you know, before I think, a lot of young people 'll get bored with it \n<$A>  Mhm mhm Well that 's what that 's what 's they were trying to do Trying to bring  , yeah trying to bring in sort of a different uhm sort of group of people that   would  usually come you know Cos most of the time it be, either families you know young children to see the dinosaurs or sort of you know uhm older people who want to come and see the uhm art   exhibitions and that  So uhm it would be bringing a lot\n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  Yeah, that 's right  \n<$B> I was in here I was in here about a year ago   and uhm  I was interested about this you know Irish History, section   upstairs you know  volunteers and stuff you know\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A>  Mhm mhm  \n<$A> Oh right\n<$B> Which was very good because when uhm I was studying I studied Irish History A level\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> And uhm when I got round to looking a lot of the stuff was very very  see it was very relevant to what I was studying   You know  like as in, I mean the battles and stuff there   was all  all the gear there you know And if I had 've knew it was there when I was studying like   I would 've definitely came up you know , It was a bit unfortunate like, But uh\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A>  Mhm mhm mhm  \n<$A> Right\n<$B>   But uhm \n\n<$A>  How   did you come across it then Just by\n<$B> Oh I just I just came in cos I 'm  , actually  I 'm a student down in Queen 's you know   so  I just, took a day off or whatever and   took  a dander round you know   so \n<$A>  Just to have a look at it  \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Uh-huh  \n<$A>  Uh-huh   you didn't know what was here before\n<$B> I hadn't a clue what was here Hadn't a clue    Hadn't a clue \n<$A>  Huh  , and you were surprised\n<$B> Yeah I was indeed I was indeed I was indeed\n\n\n<$C> And then you get your Visa\n<$D> I, you get a Visa card\n<$C> Mhm\n<$D> Automatically\n<$C> Well, when I say    it means you 've to apply for it  You apply for it I mean medical students and dental students are the only students\n<$D>  You apply for it yeah  \n<$D> Now that 's I 've got a Visa card with the Northern so I have to close that as well\n<$C> Well what we 've done with others is you can actually we can re-order we can order your new one And then when you get the new one and you 've paid off the old one just cut it up because it 's the same At the end of the day, it 's the same sort of central source   Visa  is Visa\n<$D>  Mm  \n<$D> Yeah\n<$C> But you might as well have a Bank of Ireland Visa because it 's Because when you graduate then you 're eligible for the Affinity card Have you seen that   With the Queen 's \n<$D>  The one with   the Queen 's   stuff on it \n<$C>  Yeah mhm  , which is   two percent  cheaper\n<$D>  It gives  \n<$D> And does it give money to   Queen 's you know \n<$C>  It gives   four pounds to Queen 's every time somebody takes <unclear> several sylls </unclear> They 're lovely cards <unclear> several syllables </unclear>\n<$D> Oh it is Isn't it very nice Nice\n<$C> So only if you 're now  you don't have to be a Bank of Ireland customer\n<$D> Mhm\n<$C> You can be a staff member or a graduate   but uhm or or a <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$D>  Because the the Visa card doesn't   actually have any connection to the account sure it doesn't particularly\n<$C> No\n<$D> They   they 're not \n<$C>  Although   we can get it you know set up so it 's cleared from your account   direct debit That 's true \n<$D>  Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh   uh-huh Aye normally the Visa card comes out whenever  there 's no other money about\n<$C> Exactly I know exactly   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$D>  And the overdraft 's up   <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear>\n<$C> I prefer to choose rather than having just to make it exactly  What you might find in fourth year or especially final year   you 're  away from home, then you could miss a payment,   so  it 's a very handy way of doing it and you\n<$D>  Mm  \n<$D>  Mhm  \n<$D> Yes   if you do have the loan and everything Yeah \n<$C>  And, and you and you have the loan Exactly   So it would never not be paid   Cos  if it 's Bank of Ireland on this loan we 'd send it back you know so\n<$D>  Mhm  \n<$D> Mhm mhm\n<$C> So it works out very well A lot of them have done that And then when you actually start working you can cancel that, and then decide whether you 're going to pay it yourself\n<$D> Mhm\n<$C> And how much you know They 're great to have\n<$D> So uhm what was I going to say Yes about, to opening the account   what way  do you\n<$C>  Mhm  \n<$C> It 's very simple you know Just fill in   a load  of forms and , you know But what we can do I mean you 've two other accounts which must be hard enough to manage\n<$D>  Yeah   \n<$D> Well it 's just it is   actually  but if uh it 's just that I never got round to changing   I mean over from \n<$C>  Mm  \n<$C>  From your home   I know\n<$D> Well no It  it it was uhm I was quite happy Yes because they 're both there it was   more  awkward even to close them,   to go  in and to go and sort of change my student loan just to one I I would 've changed all just to First   Trust  except that I had to, I had the student loans coming to Northern because\n<$C>  Mm  \n<$C>  I know  \n<$C>  Mhm  \n<$C> I know   Definitely  very complicated\n<$D>  Well  \n<$D> Yes  yes And then you consider I 've got two accounts in each so   I 've actually got four accounts  \n<$C>  I know I know That 's too much to   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> The last thing you want to do anyway is add another to the collection\n<$D> No\n<$C> So really if you were happy enough\n<$D> Oh yeah I would   just \n<$C>  Now what   we can do and it 's up to yourself some people would like to go in and face-to-face close the account with the other bank, or we have a form which you can fill in or sign here and we can send it to the other bank and they can either debit your account in here or credit depending on\n<$D> Mhm\n<$C> What way your account is", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d482fd82-0c69-48af-96b3-763572f11912", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.306004+00:00"}
{"text": "<Residents' Assoc>\n\n\n<$A> Okay well I think we 'll we 'll look maybe at the at the different issues a little bit later on I suppose uh, I 'll just, we 'll fly through the history and then Bob 's got a , uhm a further wee thing uh All I was going to say was, following the site visit, uh Bob uh went there  and all of us went to the Council meeting that night and uh Bob made a  about a ten minute presentation to the Council Uh, the objections that were brought up uh in this presentation were the character of the area the impact on traffic loss of amenities the site itself, the effect on the environment uh the undertaking itself from the developers ' point of view, uh the uh the maps and the inaccuracies on the maps, uh the level of opposition which was unprecedented and uh the state of apartment sales uh you know and the market for apartments at the moment which has obviously gone through its ups and downs and I think it 's really on a down at the moment Uhm, we then uh just quickly through the rest of the wee bit of history is uh  in July two thousand and two uhm the Council then, you 've got to remember the planners still hadn't made a decision on it They had , they had said that they were  going to recommend uh  passing uh approval They were saying that they would recommend it once council had commented They still hadn't actually recommended it for uh approval uh or sorry  they hadn't actually approved it Uh so at that point uh the Council recommended that it goes to the Management Board of the Planning Office Uh that 's like the hierarchy or the top level in the planning service Uh and they would look at it you know taking all the evidence uh that has been presented and make uh and uh sort of review what the lower planners had uh you know how they 'd come to their conclusion that it should be passed, uh taking into all the uh to into account all the different uh objections and uh uhm sort of  circumstances I suppose Uh and it sat there from uh July two thousand and two til uh, towards the end of September two thousand and two whenever Mr Martin intervened The developer, uh intervened and uh, pulled the application uh on the basis that a decision hadn't, happened that basically time had gone on and that the planners hadn't got to a decision, uh through whatever circumstances it happened And so he then went to the independent body called the you know the Planning Appeals Commission that you 've all been written to by and uh you know the  in other words the application was in default Uhm,  this pulled it sort of right out of the normal I suppose uh procedures and uh it  it 's now gone to this uh Planning Appeals Commission The uh , the, developer had uh has stated that he wants an informal hearing and as I know you 've probably been written to to be told that it 's on the fifteenth, sorry, it is on the fifth of February, uh ten o'clock uhm and that you were given the opportunity then to decide whether you wanted to attend that or whether you wanted to join with others to put forward a a focused opinion uh or you know, your view through a smaller a smaller body Uhm, and uh at that, that that point sort of Bob and Bob and myself we decided well we were going to attend We 'd we 'd gone this far so we were  we just said we would be there and then we decided we would call some sort of a meeting to uhm I suppose to uh, to discuss with you lot uhm the uh the way forward Uhm, we uh realise that we have to present a statement of case on the fifteenth of the first uh five pm that day and you just don't get, there 's no grace given Uh, it  it 's supposed to be fifteen hundred words and and I know that Bob has put a bit of work into this Uh it can be uh you know it 's a document that just is presented uh to the different parties before the meeting, I think two weeks before the meeting Uh we also see Mr Martin 's uh statement of case as well, and uh those documents then sort of uh are kind of the, the basis on which a discussion or informal hearing takes place chaired by the uh one of the  the uhm commission, uh the Planning Appeals Commission And it 's a roundtable, supposed to be quite a relaxed atmosphere uh hearing So it 'll be interesting Uh  so uhm, what what I suppose uh just before I ask Bob to talk about his uh, uh the actual you know the bit of work he 's done on uh putting together a statement of case, I suppose what we 're trying to say is that we 're we 're keen to put, to present a clear and reasoned argument in favour of appropriate development and against uh inappropriate uh development, uhm and maybe to consider uh whether we then go towards a compromise, uh in that meeting and we just need to hear your views and and and listen to what you 've to say about that And also to have an idea of what you 're planning uh you know if any of you have already indicated that you 're going to go to the informal hearing I suppose for our own idea of what the meeting 's going to be like we 'd like to know that, uhm and uh whether if you if you 've maybe indicated by coming tonight you may be wanting to say that you want to be represented there and if you 're happy for us to do that we would like to know that before we go And uh, also then if you 've just any ideas of the of the way forward towards the fifth of February uh we 're  open to hear all that Maybe I could open, uh threw it over to Bob here to talk about the statement of case, that bit\n<$B> The one thing we 're not quite clear about here is what actually happens at this commission at this meeting And I honestly believe it 's going to be a compromise situation where both sides are going to gradually move towards each other I don't think we can  stop any development here That 's the first thing I don't know what people feel about that but I don't see how we can actually, stop them building a range of houses Now we 've talked privately amongst ourselves about what we 'd be willing to put up with, and we 're talking about some semi-detached houses, maybe six would fit into there, three nice detached houses or a mixture of bungalows semis or whatever, that type of thing But that all fits in very nicely with the area And the one thing that I can't understand about this is this apartment block sitting right in the middle of Gilnahirk It 's just it 's so absurd So I mean that 's my opinion at the moment is that we 'll probably to have to go in to negotiate and this  uh neutral guy will just sit there and he 'll try and work between the two of us and see what, see which way we can sort something out Is that other people 's impression of this Are you still in a mind to block the thing completely\n<$C> Could could I just say I don't believe that the Planning Appeals Commission are neutral\n<$B> Right\n<$C> I believe that they are in favour of the developer   and  I 'm not, I 'm not entirely sure what the right approach to take is but I wouldn't see it as a neutral party arbitrating between two individuals and coming to some compromise like say six semi-detached or something of that order   I <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  Right  \n<$B>  They 'd certainly   claim to be neutral They claim to be I mean the   document here here \n<$C>  I wouldn't I wouldn't deny that  \n<$B> Okay mhm\n<$C> But I I don't believe on the basis of the information that we 've received recently from\n<$B> Yeah\n<$C> The Planning Appeals Commission that they are neutral in fact They seem to be in favour of the development as currently planned\n<$B> Mm\n<$A> Is that that recent DOE letter\n<$C> Uh yes\n<$A> You see that 's really, that 's still 's from planning\n<$B> That 's planning office rather than the PAC which is a different body again\n<$A> The reason that   you 're , I know what you 're saying because we we were a bit confused by that letter when it first came But I I that letter the recent one that laid out all the conditions do you remember\n<$B>  That 's separate  \n<$C> Yes\n<$A> Well that that that was, that actually is from the planners, not from the planning appeals\n<$C> So there is reason to  to hope that they are neutral\n<$A> Well everything that they have said in the way of their documentation in any of their letters If you know we we 've sort of, you can visit their website uh which is quite an interesting place to go at PAC, you know  WWW dot PAC NI dot CO dot UK I think it is uh is the website and uh you know gives you, recent it gives you uh recent examples that they 've gone through it gives you You know so it 's  it 's quite a helpful site uhm and I think that uh they claim to be neutral\n<$C> Mhm\n<$B> I 'll give you that to have a read at This is   the PAC 's , all about the procedures basically\n<$C>  Right okay  \n<$C> Oh yes thank-you\n<$B> Okay have a do have a look at that and if you hear anything that they 're not independent  I 'd be interested\n<$C> Well <unclear> several sylls </unclear> if it 's an informal meeting and for argument 's sake both sides say come to some kind of agreement, is that then uh enforceable or is that still in, you know\n<$B> We don't know Bob We just   don't know I mean that 's what I what I , I understand what you mean because you were worried that we 'd go and turn up and say, look we 'll put up with three of these and then that happens but other people aren't happy with that That 's what I 'm slightly concerned that we go with the bottom line to negotiate on But we 're not even sure if that 's the procedure yet That 's the trouble We should maybe try and clarify that a bit more,   what the actual meeting 's about \n<$C>  Right, I mean <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$D>   Well I thought it was in the instructions  , the chairman issues a report and the   report  becomes binding \n<$C>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yeah I think there is a a pretty clear uh outcome from this I think something like four weeks , there 's a there, they can whoever leads that meeting submits a report with all his findings back to the Planning Appeals Commission, and the planning they look at it for about another two or three weeks and then they issue their decision and their decision is basically like just\n<$E> I think in any tribunal situation Neil there  , it 's,  you know, it 's a tribunal and there are findings made\n<$A>  End of story  \n<$A> Yeah\n<$E> And therefore acted upon\n<$A> Yup\n<$E> I think  what 's imperative for us to bear in mind here whether, we 're sort of right on top of the site like yourselves or sort of being affected by a lot of others here with children and increased community safety aspects That going into this, we need to be seen to be fair-minded   people,  and that I think if we do sort of offer alternatives and and show that we 're quite happy that the area be developed but not exploited   You know  I think apartments, fifteen apartments is exploitation whereas maybe three detached dwellings is development You know and it 's not going to bring in an extra thirty or fifty vehicles going up and down the streets every   morning  and evening You know that type of thing And that 's   what <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> \n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A>  Yeah yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah yeah  \n<$B>  Like I 'll treat this with   what you 've said, that 's exactly what I 've got here, is a very positive statement of uh We agree with modernisation, we agree with development in the Gilnahirk area We can't not agree with otherwise our houses wouldn't be there But what we want is reasonable development and that sort of thing Now what we 've done is  drawn up a statement of case, very much a draft I 've gone round to photograph a few houses so don't mind, if your house is on it and you don't want it on it please let me know but it 's Gilnahirk Court and Gilnahirk Park But it 's just to show the type of houses that are there So there 's an  introduction about the area The next bit then is what the proposed development is the scale of it, all the sort of problems that we 've seen with the design of it I 've started to criticise the design of it I started to look at it and think this is absurd I mean there 's a playground here across a road from the main place I mean it 's daft Lots of silly wee things like that are just, so I 've accused them a little bit of uh, poor quality design and things Just  very gently Everything 's done very you know wee kicks on the shins here but all done very,   right down underneath the table", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

where you are at the moment \n<$B>  Right right right, well I   I 've always been involved in community work  , uh  voluntary community work I 'm Chair of Fermanagh Women 's Aid   I have  been since nineteen ninety   two  Founder member of Fermanagh Women 's Network   I 'm  committee member of that I sit on the Local, Partnership now which is the Local Strategy whatever crowd they call themselves now It used to be the District Partnership, and it 's the Local Strategy Partnership now I uhm was chair in within that then there was sub-committees and there was different programmes so there was a victim 's programme and because of my interest in Women 's Aid I was asked would I sit on that\n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Uh-huh  \n<$A>  Okay  \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> And then I was asked would I chair it\n<$A> Right\n<$B> So I was like a token I felt I was a token woman but there you know or as you know yourself there wasn't, you know,   and \n<$A>  In Women 's   Aid\n<$B> No   in in I  was asked to chair this new victim a victim 's uhm\n<$A>  Sorry  \n<$A> Oh right\n<$B> In uh in I I  wrote it down here so I 'd I 'd remember If you don't mind uh\n<$A> No You 're   fine \n<$B>  Me   reading at it It was uhm, right I was I uh uh I there was an advisory group set up within the District Partnership and uhm there was about six of us on it And I was asked to chair So I said I would chair   and I  didn't have much to do in it but anyway I I So that that now has been uh  stepped down Everybody is asked to stand down because the, the new partnership changed   the  District Partner  changed to be the Local Strategy Group Now they and Omagh and Strabane have jointly come together Some of their, their, relatives form a new trauma group you know for with the Lakelands Sperrin Trust\n<$A>  Okay  \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> So now I 'm a I 'm a member of that an ordinary member of that   That 's  only a new group We just have had one meeting\n<$A>  Okay  \n<$A> Right\n<$B> In that and that 's down in Omagh And that 's look at all the trauma of the Troubles   that  kind of stuff you know <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> that at home, with me local uhm, what do you call it, community association like I 'd be involved in that you know and help to run things for kids and different things In the meantime I 'm trying to get off a couple of me uhm, what do you call it uh, maybe the network now at their AGM I might resign from that cos I 'm in from the very beginning   you know  you you get energy goes up and goes down you   know , But uhm, that 's me involvement in   the community \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A>  Right, so   you 'd be quite at quite a regional level really\n<$B> Aye I think I would I forgot also that I 'm a member of NIWAF in Belfast The Northern Ireland Women 's Federation   I 'm on  the management board\n<$A>  Oh right  \n<$A> Right so you 're quite involved   then \n<$B>  I would    I would\n<$A> And when did you become when did you move to, uhm, go from say local to regional When would you say that that  how long have you been involved at a regional level   How many years \n<$B>  In in   well I 'd say in the last four or five   you know Yeah yeah yeah \n<$A>  Four or five years Alright   Well I 'll have to tailor this to suit cos I 'm, sort of expecting people to be at local, looking   at going on to <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  Are you thinking of getting involved in a public body   at all \n<$B>  Yes that 's right  \n<$B>  Yeah   I am I 'm looking at the Arts and uhm I 've wrote it down here somewhere now\n<$A> Oh well don't worry   It doesn't \n<$B>  It 's uh the   the uhm, where am I now, the Department of   Culture  Arts and Leisures In my spare spare time I like to paint \n<$A>  Culture  \n<$A> Right\n<$B> And I would would 've done different things and  had a few exhibitions over the years Years ago now\n<$A> Right\n<$B> But and then with all the other involvement I kind of but I 'd like to get back into it But I 'd be interested in that Arts   Council  and stuff like that   So  that 's where Wendy and then maybe drop a few of my other things you know\n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A> Right\n<$B> But I 'll keep on Women 's Aid and I 'll keep on the Victim Support you know\n<$A> Okay uhm, you see when you became involved in public life   was  there anything that worried you about it\n<$B>  Mm  \n<$B> Och aye Uhm I had a low self-esteem you know and I thought uh, uhm, do I know anything or you know the lack of knowledge Would I be stupid or would I come out with things you   know and  But I learned just to listen You know I 'd be a good listener now\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A> Right\n<$B> And uhm, I remember one woman annoying me because she kept repeating what some man said to beside her\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> And then I thought well you know she mightn't be that stupid like you know cos she was agreeing with him you know And yet I think no that 's not the way I would go But I would just take into account and listen to what people were doing and different especially this Partnership meeting cos it 's so deep things that they 're talking about and half of them 's all, bullshit for here  And I did say that one day that a meeting was going on and on And I says excuse me I said, in my ignorance I says but I have give up my time to come here today You some of them are there, paid to be there   statutory you know  And I said there 's an awful lot of bullshit being talked about And they all started to laugh, you   know , And and the meeting was over in about twenty minutes   after that Do you know  So like I mean maybe that 's,  but I 've got me voice now but then at the very beginning oh it was  you know, Do I know anything or what do I know  You know that kind of an oul doubting   you know  A lot of women would doubt themselves if they 'd had the capabilities And then yet, when you get in and you get a bit of training and you   know, I think it 's \n<$A>  Yeah mhm  \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Right <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Mhm   What do you think gives it gives you your voice  makes you more\n<$B> I think you have to be passionate to do it to change things\n<$A> Right Is that what motivated you\n<$B> Mm oh God God\n<$A> I 'll get onto that in a  How what did what did you hope to get out of the experience Apart from just changing things   what would you  you yourself\n<$B>  I don't know  \n<$B> I think it came from me schooling Because I was schooled at a time in the,  forty fifties fifties when uhm women weren't you know supposed to look up or do anything And at school I was told I 'd never amount to anything  Bad thing So I think that 's what motivated me then Uh when I reared me family, and uh  they started to  to leave the nest I started to look outside and think yeah I could do them things you   know  A bit like your man in the Black you know I could do that you   know   But uhm I think it 's being told you 're you 're no good at anything and then knowing rightly you are you know   that 's  that kind of thing That 's probably motivated me way back to go out and do stuff\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A>  Right  \n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A> Right\n<$B> And then I had a passion for for uhm against violence of any kind like in domestic violence we we started up here you know so, Still I 'm in it you know so That 's I suppose passion for the subjects and passion for to change   things  but also a bit of personal you know I could do I can do better   than  I have been doing you know Cos I would 've been that type of uh in that era where I left work when I got married had me family didn't go back til work, but did menial jobs like cleaning houses and stuff And I think of what I did do you know\n<$A>  Uh-huh  \n<$A>  Uh-huh  \n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> Like but anyway, and then I you know thinking I wasn't good enough for a long long time  , and then I realised Yeah  yeah to develop myself yeah\n<$A>  Right to to to develop yourself  \n<$A> Mhm Uhm and you said now you mentioned already you it took a while to develop your voice and that   that you were  really nervous to   speak and that  Uhm what uhm have you any current worries or concern about your role\n<$B>  That 's right  \n<$B>  Mm oh yeah  \n<$B> Aye in the Partnership I feel maybe I 'm not speaking out enough because I 'm there to represent women 's groups in Fermanagh   you  know And with the new money coming now from peace too it it 's all towards uhm economic you know and there 's no money for groups now or you know it 's very hard to access money\n<$A>  Right  \n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> And uh I know any of me other community you see there 's seven people from the community on it There 's seven from the council And there 's seven from  statutory bodies\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> And there 's another one there 's another one uh business and something But it 's all geared towards business and stuff And the lock of pound that they 're throwing out they 're throwing it out through training\n<$A> Mhm\n<$B> You know or through sports and stuff like you   know  So I uh I the last partnership that I was on I had a better voice in it\n<$A>  Right  \n<$A> Right\n<$B> Because it was all working for the community and there was applications coming in and we were sitting going through a stack of applications and you felt you were doing something You were saying right that wee play group needs something  , or that  one there maybe has got money from somewhere else so we we 'll look at it later You know you  you were kind of given a a role But this time it 's all more of a talking shop and there seems to be decisions you know made before and brought to the meeting you know to   for  ratification you know that kind of thing you know So I don't feel as empowered as I did on the but yet I 'm delighted to be in on this victim 's group   <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  some group you know\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A> Mhm Uhm\n<$B> Maybe I 'm talking too much \n<$A> No no no Is there any aspects of of the involvement you find psychologically off-putting\n<$B> Aye now there 's a\n<$A> Don't don't

{"text": "<Internet cafe>\n\n\n<$A> Uhm, okay basically we are thinking, you know, an idea we 're <unclear> several sylls </unclear> doing at the moment is we 're looking for an internet cafe, where we can totally brand it\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Idea being that we 'd have, be The whole cafe 'd be the Monster look and feel We 'd have You see cafes 're going to probably be quite strict about how much, you know, we can't paint Trump on the wall or   whatever , but really as much as we can get I 'm thinking the screensavers would be our home page We 'd have like our mousemats around the place, some kind of way of getting, you know uh as as good as we can get it within their you know   have as much Yeah like I mean  yeah like Trump coming out of the wall or posters or some Trump sort of on the ceiling sort of, You know   stuff like that , But it 's going to depend on how much, they 'll allow us to do that, you know the way   I  haven't even met them yet, But I 'm looking to meet them and go in and say, well this this is our ideal situation It would, the cafe would look like this,   have it fully  branded And they 're obviously not going to go for, as much as we suggest   But , I don't know I don't know how you 'd do it Is it a, like a photo or if I could bring in some kind of a, three-D thing that I can save onto a disc or something\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  As much, <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> branding stuff as you can get  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Uh-huh  \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> We probably wouldn't be able to do anything three-D, with our limited    But what do you mean  A little model or something\n<$A>  No not even three-D Sorry uh uh like a  \n<$A> No an even,  you know those webcam kind of things\n<$B> Oh right yeah yeah yeah\n<$A> I don't know Is that big   cost or \n<$B>  No to   to do that we 'd have to kind of go in\n<$A> And get a   real camera \n<$B>  Decorate the the   internet   cafe and then film it \n<$A>  Yeah, yeah   Or even could we get even a a picture of an internet cafe, any internet cafe and like   superimpose Monster stuff on it \n<$B>  Yeah I got   some pictures which I want to show you because, they 're they 're just from some of those image catalogue sites And they 're not brilliant but I just want to show you\n<$A> Mm\n<$B> And you can say that was   that 's good or bad , So do you have any particular cafe in mind Or is it\n<$A>  That 's good Okay cool  \n<$A> Well at the  like what I 'm doing at the moment is just contacting them I 've rung loads of them and arranged meetings, but I kind of wanted the creative, you know for when I go in and meet them\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Uhm, they 're going to be, the ideal one would be something like on Grafton Street or on Dawson Street They 're two that I 've got meetings with tomorrow and next   week, So  the one in Grafton Street it 's a ground floor They 'll be big Have loads of computers, lots of space, uhm,\n<$B>  Yeah so  \n<$B> Are there any on Dawson Street with   <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Yeah   there 's one on Dawson Street It 's called Yeah It 's at the end near Trinity Uhm the other thing is it 'll be, we 're looking for one that has come out, that serves food and coffee\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> And maybe has like a cafe area to it for people who are waiting or whatever\n<$B> Right\n<$A> Cos we 're going to try and brand, the coffee cups, the bags\n<$B> The whole kit and caboodle, everything\n<$A> Serviettes whatever\n<$B> You name it You brand it  God it just makes me feel sick  You 're worse than McDonald 's\n<$A> Yeah \n<$B> Okay Cos I was thinking that if we had one in mind that you 'd already approached we could go in and take digital photos of it and then, do it But that might seem a little bit cheeky, if you\n<$A> You see I  I don't want really them   to , think that we 're to go in a step ahead of them,   You know the way \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Right yeah fair   enough yeah\n<$A> Yeah I think I think if we just have, if we can get some photos of the internet of any cafe, and just kind of go well this would, basically is how it how it 'd look\n<$B> Cool, So there 's going to be screensavers Just so I know\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> Where I can put on   my \n<$A>  Uh   screensavers, mousemats, uhm something on the walls, I don't know if it would be posters or if we   could <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  Or what what about, you know, those cut-out   cardboard cut-out chunky things\n<$A> Yeah  those kind of   things yeah \n<$B>  That we   have on the walls here\n<$A> Yeah, Uhm,   maybe  ceiling stuff\n<$B>  There 's   Have you seen those dangler things that Fred has of, Buzz Lightyear and, all that   kind of stuff     These 're  apparently called danglers,   So they have a  a suction cup at one end and then something that dangles down at the other end\n<$A>  No  \n<$A>  Oh really  \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> That 's cool\n<$B> I mean if you get little Trumps,   like that \n<$A>  Trumps yeah  , Yeah that 'd be cool All that yeah All that kind of gear\n<$B> Uhm so do you   want <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  Things   maybe on the roof, like coming from the roof   and that \n<$B>  What do you   call those There 's a point of sale There 's a special name for those things that come from the roof as well Can't remember what it is, but uhm\n<$A> The thing about it is, I don't, like uhm We were, we were going to do this in the Special Olympic Village, as in, you know, you can buy a site basically and you can do it as you want <unclear> several sylls </unclear> It would be like completely <unclear> several sylls </unclear> a whole thing it would be like completely <unclear> several sylls </unclear> into the Monster 's cave kind of thing\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> So, but I suppose that 's probably going a step ahead cos these cafes aren't going to, completely want to sell out to us\n<$B> Mm\n<$A> But uhm same kind of idea Just as you, like you 're going in, once you 're in there you know straight away it 's Monster and you know\n<$B> Monster land\n<$A> You see the brand and you recognise it for the rest of your life\n<$B> What what, kind of place would it be in the Olympic Village It wouldn't be an internet cafe\n<$A> No it was it was an internet cafe we were going to do I don't think we 're going to do it now because it 's too expensive, especially if we go with this idea, if this works Uhm the internet village was basically, you can buy an area, any company that is, you know a sponsor like us You can buy the an area maybe twice the size of this room  , and do what you want  So we were going to make it in like have get loads of PCs in there and the internet and have, just the whole Monster branded thing as if you 're like walking into a monster 's house or whatever\n<$B>  And just do what you want  \n<$B> Right Monster 's house  Monster world\n<$A> Uhm so it 'll be that kind of idea but probably not to the same extent, because these internet cafes are going to have their own restrictions\n<$B> Okay,\n<$A> So I suppose it has to be, tastefully, done a bit more so\n<$B> And do you want me to kind of mock up, what the merchandise would look like, like coffee cups and\n<$A> Maybe I mean don't go into too much effort  but maybe just,   so they can \n<$B>  Well we have  , we have the coffee cups so we just can take photographs of those and put   them on  some little montage of,   different merchandising \n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah  , So yeah the cafe part of it would have uhm the coffee cups maybe bags If you could, put a bag on the counter or something Uhm, maybe like serviettes,\n<$B> What do you do in an  in an internet cafe You eat things and you look at the Web and you write   things down \n<$A>  You look at the    I 'll show you one The one on Dawson Street is actually really good You walk in the door and basically, and they 've a stand, a counter kind of here, like maybe the size of that desk\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> And behind they 've loads of cookies and popcorn, couple of sandwiches like uhm, you know those orangejuicy milkshake-type things, and then they 've a coffee machine And then just here they 've maybe four small enough tables, with like two or three stools\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Around each one And then all in there 's is like, I 'd say about twenty laptops on uh, on either side And then in the middle there 's another twenty\n<$B> Right\n<$A> So, and then on the, the wall is all glass so you know, you can have posters or whatever on the glass so that when people are walking by they 'll also see it\n<$B> We can uhm, branded notepads,   and pens at  every work station or whatever\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yeah the only like uhm The thing I don't want to price too much is, too\n<$B> Free stuff\n<$A> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>  Yeah like to always have again Monster pens there, because it it might just work out a waste I said, I suppose the most important thing is really the stuff on the walls   and , on the computers the, you know the The screensavers I suppose will just be our, or not the screensavers but the home page, hopefully will be our home page Uhm,\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> The\n<$A> Things like that You know that fly and stuff  I suppose that would   be like the monster \n<$B>  That 's a   bee Felice    it 's called a bee \n<$A>  Obviously   Uhm, you know little Trumpy things sitting   around the place \n<$B>  Yeah   Would it would it be the actual Monster dot IE home page,\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> You wouldn't have a special splash page for the Monster cafe Cos that 's, it 's kind of boring to be honest with you, the home page one\n<$A> I was thinking of the home page just cos people might recognise it, but yeah Maybe that 's a good idea to have the,   the new one  with Jill Branded\n<$B>  You know something with   Something more like the brochure that 's just the bright orange\n<$A> Yeah, maybe that as the screensaver\n<$B> Yeah screensaver   Exactly yeah \n<$A>  That would   be the screensaver And then that like hopefully we 'd have, the home page as,   ours \n<$B>  Behind the  , when   it wakes up, Okay \n<$A>  Yeah, yeah   And then you can log in to whatever address if you don't want to go to Monster\n<$B> Cool, Yeah I was looking the other day just to try and find pictures of internet cafes They 're not brilliant\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> But we might be able to use one of them Yeah I 've got three So I was thinking it would be good if I could sneak in with a digital camera and kind of take a few photographs of one, but that would probably piss someone off\n<$A> You see I 'm just If you go into the one in Dawson Street and then I meet him and go   well  this is our little spy who was in the other day   And I, it might be better  yeah but then when I meet them\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  I could go in some other company", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f0ef60f7-478a-4550-9c0b-2e85c2f72312", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.309644+00:00"}

That was all, That 's all Uhm equipment, Amplifiers, Maria was to talk to Jim O'Connor\n<$C> Yes uhm I still have to do that so yeah \n<$A> Mhm And the other thing was the swallow screening test to see how that was going with the training\n<$C> Uh yeah that 's going well We 've had two people every day apart from last Monday uhm, and we 're not doing any more now until the sixth I 've put out a bit of a rota as well uhm, you know to try and get people done There 's eight more  eight more nurses to be done in Henry Flood but apart from that, ah, once they 're done the whole of Henry Flood will be done But what I 'm hoping to do is go and arrange to meet the wards ' managers on each ward uh with Rachel Miller to try and explain to them what we 're trying to do and to see if we can get them on board So it looks like we 're going to have to do something like that in order to get the message across Uhm I 've made a rota for doing the swallow screening that I emailed round everybody\n<$?> On the sixth\n<$C> Oh yeah  That 'll be a nice to come back present Uhm, we we were thinking then about doing some joint training as well, uhm just to make sure it 's standardised because the policy 's changed a bit\n<$A> Okay So two therapists training then\n<$D> So the supervisory bit then, you know you were sending supervisors to each ward\n<$C> Yeah\n<$D> Is that so so, could we get a call then to go up and supervise somebody doing their their three swallows\n<$C> Well no I wouldn't I wouldn't agree to do that so much What what I 've been doing down in Henry Flood has been, I 've asked Elaine and Jim to do the supervised training but if I have a spare half an hour or something or if I 'm waiting to see somebody and I 've to wait for them to get sitting up in bed or something like that and there 's a nurse I 'll say do you want to go and do a supervised training now You know kind of   fit around my own schedule \n<$D>  Okay yes   Yeah okay\n<$C> Uhm because strictly speaking the nurses can can , the like the ones that have been using it all the time   can  supervise the new ones   uhm  and I I wouldn't commit to having to go up there the whole time to do the three trainings with every nurse but if you 're hanging around, you know So I 've done quite a few supervised training before just because I 've been waiting for somebody else or I 've had a half an hour   to spare before I go  and do something else, Uhm so it 's to do that kind of thing and it 's also to kind of keep an eye that people who haven't done training aren't doing the swallow screening\n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$D>  Right okay  \n<$D>  Yeah yeah okay  \n<$D> I know what you mean Mm\n<$C> Uhm\n<$D> Mm\n<$C> And just if uhm Rosie Daly has any problems just to like to relay them, that kind of thing, just to keep an eye on things really\n<$A> Okay Grand Okay So nothing else on that Uhm anybody need to add anything else to the agenda\n\n<$A> Oh, no Sorry I thought I had one <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n\n<$A> Nothing else, Nothing else to add on then, Uhm okay we 'll push on then The AHP update I just put that on, in case there was anything\n<$D> There really wasn't, there wasn't any management team meeting, and when there isn't a management team meeting, there isn't a whole pile it was mostly about the OT service which is down further on Well it 's actually next on the document anyway\n<$A> Okay\n<$D> Uhm it was really Sylvia was just uhm, brought up the fact that there 's now no OT service to general medical and general surgery, and she said that some of I don't know did you go to speak to her but she said that some of the Physios and some of the OTs, or some of the social workers had been coming to her personally and saying, oh look we 've a patient please you have to do this and she said she 's getting a lot of hassle and she just asked if people could stop doing that please because there 's nothing she can do about it She said literally they had one basic grade with a waiting list of sixty, and they had to cut it, you know, because, as she said, they have a duty of care to the staff as well The patients are not going to be seen, there 's going to be no exceptions made because, as she said herself if, if that happens then nothing will change, Uhm the CEO made the decision not to, not to fill any more of the posts uhm and that 's where the problem is There 's no more funding for those posts and she 's not allowed fill them with agency staff, so she had to make a stand Uhm so basically it 's going to hold up discharge uhm or else patients will be discharged unsafely, uhm and they 're probably going to come back in through Casualty but that 's probably the only way things 'll change I think she had people lined up for the four posts but because it was so delayed they 've all since got other jobs\n<$A?> That 's terrible\n<$D> Mm, So it is, I mean she said herself like it 's going to affect all the other services as well, but she 's just asked if you can kind of not be, because I think some of the OTs have got hassle, I don't know from any of the other allied health professions but certainly from doctors and from nurses they 're getting hassle and getting abuse down the phone so she asked that people could maybe just, you know accept the situation and,\n<$A> Stop abusing\n<$D> Yeah\n<$E> Well that 's what uh the OT told me to do She said go and speak to Sylvia about this\n<$A> Right\n<$E> So, I did\n<$A> Yeah\n<$E> So\n<$A> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$D> I think they 're just totally fed up because, you know the same thing 's happening with dieticians, they 're not allowed fill their posts\n<$?> Yeah\n<$D> Uhm particularly with OT though I suppose because they don't have a paediatric one as well it just seems like they 're being completely hard done by\n<$?> Yeah, being victimised\n<$?> How many are they down now\n<$D> Four, no five\n<$?> Five right,\n<$?> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$D> Uh, no,\n<$A> Okay No other queries on that now\n<$C?> It 's crazy how that can happen though isn't it Cos like physio have a full complement of all those\n<$D> But it it seems to be a bit hit and miss like we were always allowed advertise our posts and there was no problem with, you know if there was a locum available, just put the locum in place But OTs there was a total, and I think the CEO said that they would stagger the recruitment, but they haven't Like they 've completely blocked the five posts They 're not allowed fill them They 're not allowed get agency staff It 's crazy\n<$E> And that was an informed decision, was it\n<$D> That was the CEO decided yeah, They said that there was no funding I think it was just unfortunate for them that five kind of five posts came up at the same time\n<$C> Mm\n<$D> And they weren't allowed replace any of them You know it wasn't even like, well you can replace two out of the five it was just no you can't replace any of them\n<$C> That 's terrible\n<$D> Until January but if you 've got people lined up they 're not going to wait til January if they 've got something else available\n<$C> It must be quite stressful for them at the same time Terrible\n<$D> That 's what she said She said there 's a few more thinking of leaving now\n<$C> Yeah <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> 's leaving, There 's going to be no-one\n<$D> Because I think up until now it was always community care for OTs was like, oh major stress but now it 's\n<$C> Mm\n<$D> It 's not so bad And I don't think it 's as bad in any other hospital because there isn't the same block on recruitment,\n<$D> Poor Sylvia was nearly crying at the meeting yesterday,\n<$B?> Must be awful <unclear> several sylls </unclear> for Christmas <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$D> I 'd say there probably just will be enough\n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> Alright then\n\n<$D> Grand Uhm projects The dementia support group\n<$E> Yeah I just asked to put that on Uhm, it 's more really Rebecca who 's involved with this than myself, but uhm The dementia support group is going to be run again I think in , no February, is that the planning time, for, eight weeks And just if anyone has any patients that they think would be suitable, for their carers to attend, let us know Cos we 're looking for names That 's all really\n<$B?> And we 're hoping to send the letters out in the first week of January so if we could get the names ASAP,\n<$A> Names to Maria or Lisa\n<$E> Yeah\n<$B> Okay\n<$A> Alright then <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$F> Uhm, just that myself and Cheryl want to get back going, on that  Uhm we have, this is the template at the moment so far the draft that Laura 's up done for what we have out but as we said in the last meeting we still don't know what way to give it to them, whether we should try and put it onto something or if we just give it to them plain in poster format Uhm we were hoping to get feedback and Sybil was saying she has a few GP friends and maybe to get some feedback from them on what they like getting, getting through the door and what they would throw out So cos, if we 're going to be especially laminating everything or putting everything onto it we want it to be worthwhile, moneywise, so uhm we don't want to rush into it Uhm as I said in the last meeting we have the catchment area of GPs but if we could uhm ask around certainly and get some feedback from people to find out what would be a useful way of giving it to them\n<$D> Yeah, I still think it probably needs to go along with, not a training session but some kind of, you actually going to speak to them face-to-face or some little bit more contact cos if that literally just on its own with a letter arrives on the door they 're not going to read it, they 're just going to chuck it in the bin, I would say Cos they get so much stuff in\n<$C> Even a personal delivery on it or something\n<$F> Well there are over three hundred GPs in the catchment area, so I doubt we could do that Uhm and I suppose we would have to get support if we 're going to be inviting the GPs in Uhm I don't know how many would show up If they 're not going to read the poster are they going to drive over to the hospital\n<$A> What about the GP study days There was one about three weeks ago They have one two or three times a year, They are arranged, <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> was at a meeting yesterday somewhere, where was it <unclear> several sylls </unclear> There was one about three or four weeks ago\n<$F> Oh\n<$A> Uhm they 're arranged externally but they 're always held here\n<$F> Mm\n<$C?> I don't know who arranges them\n<$F> I should look into that\n<$C> Yeah Do you remember about three weeks ago there were signs up along the corridor,  GP study day down at the education centre \n<$E> Yeah maybe\n<$C> But I just don't know who organises it", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "837cdc68-daa9-47e9-8359-bab160219a72", "added":

{"text": "<Journal club>\n\n\n<$A> I won't go into that It 's all different seconds for each food Posture control and mobility uhm had adequate head trunk and foot control but was unable to walk uhm at the very beginning She was able to roll from supine to prone and to assume the crawling position Uhm at at the very end of the twelve months she walked short distances with a walker, wearing her ankle foot uhm brace but her preferred method of ambulation remained crawling on all fours when indoors She began climbing and descending stairs with physical assistance so basically they 're saying everything improved <&> laughter <&> Uhm and it goes on to talk about uhm human social integration is based on verbal communication and strongly modulated by facial expressions and that people uhm, basically, some people don't know how to accept uhm children who basically, they 're saying about her posture was very bad, if she was slumped over, whereas her posture was much better at the end People were approaching her more and because of her head positioning and because of her facial expressions were normal Uhm, so, basically recommendations for management, uhm therapy with intra-oral appliance, the ISMAR, had a normalising effect on circum-oral and intra-oral musculature of a twelve year ten month old girl with cerebral palsy and moderate ingestive impairment Gains were made in eating, uhm more varied food textures, as documented by greater efficiency of eating fluid and viscous foods and by improved skills in spoon-feeding, biting, chewing, straw-drinking, and clearing These ingestive skills may form the basis for the marked weight gain during the treatment period Improvement in postural functions, ambulations as well as upper extremity functions may be due to the improved nutritional state and-or better positional control Carefully chosen clientele for oral appliance therapy has the potential for making good progress in developmental motor skills So uhm, that 's all\n<$B> I wonder will she continue to improve or is it just, short-term effects\n<$A> Yeah\n<$C> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> before and after pictures <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> There 's a picture of her\n<$B> I 'm just wondering would it be generalisable to the entire population The kind of thing behind it in the abstract and on the internet is that therapists don't need to go during daily oromotor therapy because this thing does it itself at night and you just kind of set it for the different parts of the night to do whatever you 're working on And then you don't have to go out and dig out a therapist every day for a year or whatever <unclear> several sylls </unclear> <#>\n<$C?> What client group\n<$B> Well they always say about it for   <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>  but I just wonder would it be generalisable to\n<$C>  Cerebral palsy  \n<$A> I wonder how it feels in the mouth because if they can spit it out so easily, you know the way kids are\n<$C> They say it 's really common in European <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> I 'd never heard of it before\n<$A> Yeah Neither had I\n<$B> I suppose the thing I 'd wonder about is the sensory side of things Like what child is going to let you put, like especially a child with uhm cerebral palsy that probably has hypersensitivity and probably has bite reflexes and everything else All that would have to be desensitised before you could get near their, like that 's one of the main problems of treating them in the first place is getting to their mouth, and then to put in an appliance like that Do they remove some teeth for it as well I wonder\n<$?>   No \n<$?>  No  \n<$C?> I wonder, you know the way the orthodontic ones would have the strap round the head\n<$B?> The head brace Yeah, Cos they have other little attachments that you can put on extra beads for voice stimulation and all this kind of stuff\n<$A> I suppose adults you 'd wonder if they had let 's say a comorbid, say, respiratory problem that they wouldn't want something in their mouth Let 's say they had a depression where they wouldn't want this in for six months,\n\n<$A> So I think we should get some and try them, on Eve , <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$C?> Do you want mine\n<$?> Mhm\n<$C> Uh what I thought I would do is just feed back a little bit on the conference that I went to in Australia, which I haven't fed back much on Uhm, I, you know, there 's one article, not an article just a study that I want to go through as well and then, uhm a video, client video Uhm it was, ran over three days and there was a lot of people there from Australia and South Africa and England and America, Europe, uhm places like Poland and all sorts of places like that so it was very well attended Uhm it tended to be quite academic in the main speakers They were doing a lot of things that are great from a research point of view but I don't know how much they would be useful for a  realistic treatment setting such as this Uhm and how they go into huge detail, uhm so many assessments you 'd need to do and then we 'd need to do all this kind of therapy and uhm, you know so that I mean it was very interesting but I don't know how much it would cross over onto uhm our work But what was more interesting was that in the break times every day they had poster sessions and that was more realistic, little research projects going on in uhm in settings such as this Uhm and some of them were very different, like uhm uh head injuries after a gunshot wounds in South Africa and things like that, uhm, computer club for people with aphasia, internet training for people with brain injury, uhm communication activities in hospital settings Uhm and then from Austria to Australia, this was quite interesting, they did uh face-to-face distance teaching via the internet for people who were in Austria but they were Australian and they wanted to have their speech therapy with with an Australian therapist and it was all done over the internet And they said that they had positive feedback\n<$B?> Is that like a webcam or is it like\n<$C> Yeah\n<$E>  The webcam, doesn't that slow down images and everything You don't see the here and now \n<$C> No It 's like a new method of speech training and like they 'd have very limited amount of time on the computer and then it would be all about going off and doing your own work and coming back and doing more And it 's, I suppose the only benefit that I could see is that they didn't have to leave their own house Like there was no kind of <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Then there was another one, tackling public transport and that was really interesting about uhm I think it was an English one where they uh got all the bus drivers from their area and they educated them about aphasia and they they did kind of like a you know a test beforehand about the reactions that people with aphasia got when they got onto the bus and how difficult they found it, and then they had uhm the training sessions and the you know gave the handouts about what aphasia is very very simple handouts and then like uhm suggestions about how to make it easier for somebody with aphasia and what aphasia means and everything like that And then the people <unclear> several sylls </unclear> go back to see how they got on and it was very positive Uhm and then there was a group called aphasia group and this was by Deborah Jean Wilson, she was a huge big black woman you know with all the robes and everything and she was like, all people have a say in the comedy of aphasia  But you know, they were, I thought all of those things were really good, much more interesting than the actual talks themselves So I 'm just going to talk about one of them which is uhm hospital staff perceptions versus speech therapy recommendations about the strategies we give about communication So if we have a patient with aphasia, this is what they 've done with somebody with aphasia but if we have somebody you know with Alzheimer 's or any other kind of communication problem and the strategies that we write on the chart are put up beside the bed you know how much are they used really Uhm, and you know they just, they went through all the strategies and then the nurses had to fill out a form about how useful they thought they were and how often they would use them and if they weren't using them why wouldn't they use them And you 'll find that the staff nurses that have been working on the ward for the longest period of time would use it, whereas uhm inexperienced staff wouldn't be bothered using it Uhm and a lot of the time they said it was because a lot of the time the strategies would be put on the chart but not actually explained to them or the strategies would be put up beside the bed but they didn't think it was related to them or they didn't actually have to do anything with them Uhm and sometimes that our even our very simple kind of terminology we 'd use would be lost on them They wouldn't know what you meant Uhm, and they felt that they really needed before doing any strategies on the ward with nursing staff they needed to have training, uhm and you know getting as to what we meant by getting eye you know eye contact <unclear> several sylls </unclear>, and by when we say use gesture, what do we mean by using gesture and all that kind of thing, so I thought that was quite interesting especially as we do that a lot and we don't have any nurse training for uhm for the nurses you know to try and explain what we do <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> that if anyone wants to approve it Uhm, as well then during the breaks they had all these uhm obviously all these people advertising their books and their equipment and everything and there was one thing I thought was quite interesting but I don't know whether it 's available here, which is called the National  Relay Service uhm, it 's an Australian service and and what they do is, it 's for people who have speech impairment or a hearing impairment, uhm to allow them to use the phone like any normal person Uhm and what they do is they ring through to this National Relay Service and then they 've to give the phone number of who they want to uh contact, and if they 're deaf, uh if the person they want to contact is deaf uhm they have a little like a computer type thing so they can, uhm they get the speech back, like typed so the person in the relay centre will type out your message, it goes to the deaf person 's computer, they type back and you get it back in the form of speech via the National Relay Service Or if you have uhm a speech impediment they have uhm you know people with dysarthria and things like that the the people in the Relay Service will be specially trained to try and uhm you know interpret uhm speech impediments or else to kind of you know facilities like, before they start the conversation you know, What does this mean Uhm what what are you trying to say And is there any long words that you might have difficulties <unclear> several sylls </unclear> or the other person might have difficulty understanding Uhm then they would put the call through and the person uses their own voice but the National Relay Service person says you know this person has uhm a speech impediment, please don't hang up the phone You know if you have difficulty understanding I 'll help to translate for you So I thought it was brilliant Uhm and there 's a video on it which illustrates what it 's all about which is a bit corny in times but it 's it 's interesting Do you want to watch it", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3fbb3f28-9a54-4c8f-9867-7b2f30c30f94", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.312938+00:00"}

Okay uhm in Medicine I 'm getting hospital IDs, we don't get hospital IDs from Saint James 's, I need to acquire them We 've been talking a little bit about that before I 've made progress actually I 've been talking to the CEO in Saint James 's He was down in Kilkenny, oh yeah yeah we were in Kilkenny you know and he goes oh yeah that 's right, have a chat, so I 'm   getting,  I 'm getting progress on that Sorry\n<$D>  <unclear> several sylls </unclear>  \n<$D> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Sorry\n<$D> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$D> Mr Cahill\n<$A> No that 's Nab

Right anyway back to the subject at hand Another problem in Medicine is the, is Simpson, Professor Simpson is determined to introduce a surgery exam by the end of this year in complete contravention, in complete contravention of the college calendar Now he really is delusional, probably some sort of psychotic break he 's had because he thinks he can just bypass the college calendar, eh, which is absolute rubbish And it 's something that I will actually have to face him down on and it 's not something I 'm looking forward to because he 's a I don't, he 's he 's very odd and he 's a bit kind of vindictive So It 's going to be fun Uhm, fifth year, sixth year, they 're kind of ticking along There 's too much focus on, fourth year because they want to fix it therefore fifth year are neglected\n<$B> Someone has to suffer\n<$A> Someone has to suffer and sadly people have to suffer But that 's pretty much it Uhm, , nursing\n<$D> Uhm, the biggest thing from the first years is their classroom size, too small, too crowded And their schedule, because it 's booked so late they 've early  early starts and late finishes so their day is actually very long That 's all I 've got from them so far\n<$A> Mhm\n<$D> But uhm, the biggest problem with me is actually contacting students I 've had resistance as I said to you from the tutors already They don't want me to contact them through classrooms, so they  want me to go through Trinity, and I 'm not authorised yet to access the email listings   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> , so hopefully soon\n<$A>  Hopefully soon </> , hopefully soon\n<$D> That 'll open up the channel of communication I 'll be able to get somewhere then, get more topics going\n<$A> Okay well just get on to Stephanie Brennan and the various course co-ordinators and just try and sort that there out They know all know about the situation\n<$D> They all know about me yeah\n<$A> They all know about you so it 's just really tackle it from there Well just go, but I mean like, whenever I hit a brick wall what I do is actually I go to the person at the top and then you work your way down from the top   to \n<$B>  Are   you not meant to start from the bottom and work your way up Tom\n<$A> No but you 'll hit, they 'll just say no and then you 'll you 'll spend   three layers going through \n<$B> But as you you hit a blank wall  you just go up higher  \n<$A> No but you you just, you you hit resistance, then you hit resistance then you hit resistance, because the one at the top can tell the one at the very bottom So you don't have to through the whole chain of demand The one at the top   just says \n<$C>  But could   you not piss a lot of people off when you 're doing it that way\n<$B> Yeah that 's, that 's what I 've been told\n<$A> You can piss a lot of people off, you have to  , you have to be tactful \n<$B>  Cos like I 'm told I have to go to staff   meetings, school committee, faculty exec   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$J>  That 's for big decisions   but if you 've a problem that needs solved such as getting in contact   with students \n<$B>  Oh yeah that 's fair enough   You just go   straight up \n<$D>  I mean I know that my  , I 'm not just doing I can't do my, act out my role when I can't contact the   students  And then they 've heard of me, I know that they know there 's somebody appointed but they 've no contact with   me either \n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$A>  Yeah   Well , get on to Stephanie Brennan   anyway  and sort it with her You you actually are in a unique role by   having, such a lot of people lot of people to deal with \n<$D>  Mm  \n<$D>  Yeah, no, I 've already spoken to a lot of, I was actually  , I was lecturing psychiatry students from Pat 's, Brendan 's and uhm Saint Loman 's last week so I spoke to all of them and gave them all my email address like, for any student issues but they haven't got back to me on any yet So they know about me anyway\n<$A> There probably won't be very much going on in the School of Nursing that is problematic Most of your role will be helping out the School of Nursing in the whole faculty   perspective    anyway \n<$D>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Once they know  , I think\n<$D> Once they know about me and can contact me it   should be \n<$G>  It 's unfortunate as well  , because of nursing you 're going to run into problems with, they 're going to be under pressure from the government to try and get as many nurses in as they can\n<$D> Yeah\n<$G> So they 're always going to throw that back to you, Och Jesus \n<$D> I suppose it, it 's going to, and obviously you talked before about starting up a nursing society That 'll all come in time,   as they come \n<$A>  That will that will   we 'll we 'll work on that By the end of this year we 'll have   one set up \n<$B>  Do they want to   go under the therapy society\n<$A> They 're an awful large crowd\n<$D> There 's a huge amount I mean I 've, I 've been given like fifteen like, I 've been given a list of just thirty student reps already\n<$B> What\n<$A> Oh wow\n<$D> That I 've, that are under me I actually have their names representing midwifery and and I 've thirty names already I 've been given\n<$A> Mm\n<$D> And uh that 's not including most of the post-grads, that 's all undergraduates and\n<$A> How many are there altogether anyway, undergrads\n<$D> I think it 's fifteen hundred students in total\n<$B> Oh my God\n<$A> Oh yeah There 's going to be there 's going to be over two and a half thousand in four years ' time\n<$D> Yeah There 's fifteen hundred at the moment and there 's thirty reps,   the names I 've been given \n<$A>  That 's why  , yeah, that 's why it 's very important to get a handle on the whole nurses ' course now\n<$D> But I 've  I 've already written to Drogheda and the Rotunda, like to the school of whatever, the School of Nursing to let them know about me and try and get the reps, you know, to register with the students union but I 've heard nothing back\n<$A> Just keep, just just keep plugging on that one but, co-ordinate with Stephanie Have you have you actually met her yet\n<$D> Yeah I did In Kilkenny yeah\n<$A> Well now get, well, on the nineteenth of November we 'll be meeting everybody anyway So get onto them there Uhm, anything else\n<$D> No that 's it for the moment\n<$A> Right Your good self Adrian What 's to report\n<$C> Big strike in Dental Hospital\n<$A> Has that started\n<$C> Yes   It 's  in the second week now\n<$A>  Well  \n<$A> How many\n<$C> There 's talk of it being resolved by next week\n<$A> There 's going to be a lot of talk on   this matter \n<$B>  Who 's striking   and why\n<$C> Part-time staff Uhm\n<$B> Administration Or\n<$C> No, clinical staff, clinical teachers\n<$B> Right Okay\n<$C> Well not just clinical teachers, all the part-time teaching staff Uhm\n<$A> What exactly do they want\n<$C> They want recognition of, their teaching They want uh\n<$A> But all you have to\n<$C> Certify as uh, do you remember we discussed this in   Kilkenny \n<$?>  Mm  \n\n<$B> It wasn't, I wasn't I wasn't in this group anyway\n<$B> Yeah but still we all went to the other groups I remember that yeah\n<$C> Yeah, the one about retentions of   part-time staff  was certification of teaching and teaching abilities and all that kind of stuff They want that Uhm apparently they 're also getting, which the

{"text": "<Ulster Football>\n\n\n<$A> All good teachers Jerome accept a a note from parents Referee today is Eugene Murtagh from Longford  who refereed the All-Ireland Junior Football Final of two thousand and one between Kerry and Roscommon and also a Fermanagh Donegal game two years ago So the last piece of the jigsaw 's underway It 's Monaghan in the blue and white who are playing from left to right, slightly favoured by the wind, with their captain Dermot Duffy Tried to pick up that poor pass, ball looked as if it was touching the ground This could be an early opportunity for the men of Monaghan against the Down side which contains six of the players who brought the All-Ireland minor title to the county in nineteen ninety-nine\n<$B> I didn't know Jerome cared Jimmy But anyway, this is not the place to foul against Monaghan Paul Finlay 's left foot recorded I think it was eight or nine scores in Clones, he could start off in the same vein here\n<$A> That 's exactly what he does, exactly thirty-nine seconds on the clock Paul Finlay, son of Ciaran Finlay, a former Monaghan legend, but a star in his own right\n<$B> A few bits and pieces of changes as well on the Monaghan team Michael Slowey 's out at centre half forward and the two Freeman brothers are now playing on either side of Raymond Ronaghan on the full forward line,\n<$A> The Armagh defence learns to its cost just how deadly young Finlay could be from a played ball We 'll see if Paddy O'Rourke and the Down boys have learnt from that Down coming into this game had the poorest championship record of of any Down team It 's four years since they won a a match That was in nineteen ninety-nine in the semi-final against Tyrone but here 's one man intent on making sure that that record is put to rest That 's the number twelve, Colm McCrickard from Leitrim Fontenoy, he 's a nephew of the famous Joe McCrickard, and he 's the one who brings them level after almost two minutes, Immediately Jason Hughes got that ball he was closed down Quickly taken free, spread across the middle to the full forward Raymond Ronaghan who has come from the edge of the square Feeds it back to the Castleblayney player and captain Dermot Duffy back to Ronaghan again Where Ronaghan goes, so does Brendan Burns, or Brian Burns I should say And now it 's Paul Finlay with the left foot again, from free kick or from play, the man from Ballybay Three years a minor, two years an under twenty-one, and he 's got two points Monaghan have two, Down have one, An excellent jump and punch by Gregory McCartan, head into the path of Walsh, Walsh faced by Padraig McKenna, blocked by McKenna, and loses again So it 's a side-line for Down, Liam Doyle, with that left foot, drives it in towards the square Murphy kept his eye on it all the way and fed it out to Nicholas Corrigan The half forward-back in his half-back line That 's a cross field ball, there are three Down men there and the one to come away with it is Liam Doyle He took that side-line ball a second ago Dan Gordon, Loughinisland man, holds it up, turns, heaves it back to McCartan, McCartan with a languid left foot That 's an excellent strike Gregory McCartan from Castlewellan\n<$B> And he again the long ball in Jimmy to Dan Gordon working well He ignored Ben Coulter going through the middle, gave it to McCartan, and McCartan has finally found the range\n<$A> Nicely into the hands of Martin Cole as the sun comes out in Casement Park Walsh, off his man, nice-angled ball, bravely up for it, and is caught That was Martin Cole going through He didn't take his eye off the ball and just got his hand to it and was caught on the way down\n<$B> I don't think there was anything intentional there Jimmy Just as the ball came across it was uh Michael Walsh picking him out, both players going for the ball, obviously Micky Cole was in a better position and he got a slap on the face,\n<$A> Nice kick again Liam Doyle kicks it over, puts Down into the lead And that 'll please his Uncle Pat and all the other Leitrim Fontenoy supporters who are watching this match at home, Another huge kick by Glenn Murphy but an even more impressive catch McCartan was there, and such was the drive and determination of McCartan that he managed to engineer a free out of that That time the kick was with the right foot, Down 's Michael Walsh Walsh holds it up, feeds it inside but, poor pass collected by Owen Lennon Monaghan moving out from the back Damien Freeman, now it 's picked up by Corrigan Four Down men were around him Brian Burns was there, all over the Monaghan forward And we 've a free for Monaghan So Monaghan 's ploy of just playing the two men inside is certainly having its moments as well\n<$B> Yes and as you, it was he was in there on his own They 're switching in and out Jimmy Raymond Ronaghan is in there with uh Damien Freeman from time to time Damien Freeman then is taking a run out and Thomas is going in, and it 's causing it 's causing problems for the Down defenders,\n<$A> All eyes on Paul Finlay And as usual, the man from Ballybay doesn't disappoint Three points for Paul Finlay, three for Monaghan and three for Down\n<$B> Yes Sweet strike, perfect position for him\n<$A> Michael McVeigh, surveys the wide open space of Casement Park, drives it in under the stand Back come Monaghan again Good work by the corner back, John Clarke, one of six of the All-Ireland Minor Team And here 's the man who captained them that day That was Liam Doyle, driven in by the captain Sean Ward but allowed to run through Collected by Glenn Murphy Fed out to Owen Lennon Away comes Lennon And now it 's the man wearing the substitute 's jersey, Anthony Rooney, who would come in for the A N Other He 's moving all on his own Does he want to shoot He certainly does Does he score The umpires say that he does Michael McVeigh said it was a wide But that was an inspirational score Remember that started as a shot at the far end He picked it up from his midfielder and he had only one thought on his mind\n<$B> Heads out to field in the middle of the park for his club Clontibert This was a tremendous run Uhm, we 're looking at this almost in line with the shot And I wasn't as sure as the umpire is that it was over Jimmy, but uh as you say, it certainly deserved a score\n<$A> Paul Finlay Takes the quick one Into Ronaghan and he seemed to be surprised by it But Finlay again, toe-taps with the left, shoots with the right Men hang down below Brilliant catch by Nicholas Corrigan Gets it, holds it Now needs a little bit of help A little bit of footballing skills on the ground from Michael Slowey The Clones player dummies And again Now pursuing him is Alan Molloy He switches onto the left foot That 's a brilliant score That score was all about guts and determination, and none showed it better than Michael Slowey who came back from a very serious back injury\n<$B> It was a great combination of persistence and skill There 's a solo dummy, dummy inside with a bounce I thought he was going to get caught here But no he stepped back inside onto his less-favoured left foot and had the confidence to knock it over There 's a couple of great scores for Monaghan in a row They play with great confidence Jimmy, working harder in the middle third of the field, a lot of breaking ball out there And they 're winning probably the the majority of them at the minute as they did against Armagh\n<$A> Yes now whether <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> they 're prepared to dive in after them Paul Finlay out There 's a young man certainly on top of his game Nice transfer inside Hooked over the shoulder Over the bar it goes He shakes the hand of the man who passed the ball to him Excellent score\n<$B> Again, sorry Jimmy, again Finlay involved, uh but it was Thomas Freeman that finished it but a great ball in, one in the middle of the field, a great ball played into the corner in the space Finlay made great work of it, and it was a great finish by Freeman from a tight angle Monaghan are on a roll now\n<$A> Twenty-two minutes gone in this first half Alan Molloy, plenty of time on the ball for a change, kicks it high up towards Dan Gordon, the ploy which worked so well in the early stages Back to Walsh again and now it 's Gordon Holds it up, feeds it off intelligently to the man on the run That 's his midfielder and the big number nine, Gregory McCartan, in fact it 's Sean Ward, the other midfielder who gets it It was the right foot that was the clue in that instance\n<$B> Right a great burst through the middle and in fairness Down needed that Jimmy They 'd fallen behind to four consecutive uhm, five consecutive Monaghan points,\n<$A> Glenn Murphy certainly not getting the distance that Michael McVeigh is getting Broken down by Coulter into the path of Martin Cole Cole, fed it over the head of Coulter but it was always going to be a defender 's ball Owen Lennon as Nicholas Corrigan, a man who has, even at this early stage has covered almost every blade of the Casement Park grass Feeds it into Thomas Freeman, scorer of one point, gives it into Ronaghan Ronaghan holds it up, almost too long one would have thought and now the man of the moment Finlay who 's faced by Alan Molloy, shrugs him off Now that 's a narrow angle for anybody but not for Paul Finlay What a brilliant score by Finlay It 's no wonder he danced his way out Played the ball up, did everything right and I 'm sure Molloy thought, like all the rest of us, he couldn't score from here\n<$B> Yes Down have changed Alan Molloy onto him to try to counter his height, his fielding, uh but obviously there, the best score so far out of his six,\n<$A> A huge jump again by McCartan Down, get the break, come away with the ball Nice ball into the path of Coulter Coulter holds it But once again Monaghan 's resolve however, that was Freeman loses out Dan Gordon, the quick flick inside, goes to Michael Walsh Walsh, to the man all on his own and that man is Liam Doyle So while Down have their left-footed ace in Paul Finlay, Liam Doyle with his three points, that 's his first from play, it proving to be the ace in the Down attack\n<$B> Down people dream about this sort of attacks Jimmy from the class of ninety-nine, these minors Lovely laid-off ball by uh the full forward to Michael Walsh, to Liam Doyle going by him, and a good finish\n<$A> Rory Woods is the man who 's come on Players tossing off the ball, and there 's a free and I think it 's to Down,\n<$B> Yes Down worked that fairly well Jimmy From a free kick in the middle of the field in a non-scoring position, they now find themselves uh with Liam Doyle with a good chance of scoring And it wasn't a free that Monaghan needed to give away\n<$A> A minute and twenty seconds into injury time Liam Doyle floats over his fourth point of the afternoon It 's Down 's seventh And Down needed that\n<$B> Yes another good effort and it literally, the ball 's not going to be kicked out It was on the blow and it brings the, the difference to just two points", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "8cd96c1d-ab60-4c72-a42d-ed128b18f767",

{"text": "<Football matches>\n\n\n<$A> As they say it 's all to play for in the second half Cavan four points in front, and Martin McHugh will have told them that they must play and play for these thirty minutes, because the lead isn't great considering the conditions, Pat Dooley for Roscommon, you can see the ease with which he kicked that ball in the wind Good block, very good block from Gerry Sheridan on Don Connellan but Connellan wins possession again and this time Sheridan not so cultured Free kick for Roscommon And with the conditions as they are, you would expect, you would expect Nigel Dineen to be able to point from here And if you give away needless frees like that Cavan, you 'll find in no time the sides will be back level So Dineen the ball, as you can see, practically on the thirteen metre line You should be pointing them from there and Dineen certainly is capable of it One goal in five, just five points, Interesting to see how Brendan McCormick copes with the conditions on the kick-out Again the ball hanging and dropping And Dineen, winning possession fouled on the forty-five metre line, and he take the kick himself Martin McHugh will be hoping against hope that that lead isn't eaten away in the first five minutes of the second half Promotion to division two guaranteed for Cavan if they win today You have to fancy them to be in the quarter final stages, And that one 's wasted from Nigel, and much to the delight of the three thousand or so fans, the sun has returned and let 's hope it shines for the rest of the game, Pat Shiels breaking and Roscommon getting the breaking ball again through Vinnie Glennon, and Vinnie plays it out the wing and it 's Lorcan Dowd, too much space Lorcan Dowd and he makes more for himself Dowd has a look at the target, Well-taken point Lorcan Dowd for Roscommon There 's just two between them, Well if the sun is shining for anyone it 's shining for Paul Ross at the moment Brendan McCormick thought he had to deal with hailstones in the second half now it 's the sun shining in his eyes that 's the problem We 're having every form of weather condition today This is Adrian Lambe for Cavan, trying to make himself some space, the ball cleared by Tom Grehan, and there 's open space now for Nigel Dineen, but McCormick arrives in time, or has he Lorcan Dowd, Dowd punches and Dowd scores, but really, there should have been a goal for Roscommon a moment ago However, Lorcan Dowd, picking up the breaking ball and punching it over the bar That 's a vital score, The bad news for Cavan is the fact that Brendan McCormick while making that very good save has injured his thigh It seems like a dead leg from here, and to try and play in goal with such an injury is practically impossible So Martin McHugh may consider taking on the sub-goalkeeper The advice sometimes is to run the injury off but when you 're a goalkeeper it 's exceptionally difficult to do that and when you have a dead leg it tends to become stiffer and stiffer as the game goes by So disadvantage Cavan at the moment but advantage to them in the way that McCormick came out to stop Dineen a few moments ago, There 's just a point between them It 's one five Cavan, seven points Roscommon And it 's broken again, The referee decides that 's a free in favour of Roscommon Don Connellan leaves it to Nigel Dineen Dineen may decide here to take it out of his hands No he 's elected to, try again with the left foot, Nigel Dineen of course who played for Connaught in the Railway Cup, very respected player, Dineen, usually noted for his free-taking but hasn't really been on form this afternoon Stephen King has possession for Cavan he 's also won a free kick He takes it quickly, Philip Smith puts it down the middle, but not to any advantage for the Cavan men There 's King again Tower of strength for Cavan, Stephen King, and Deery 's, equal to that for Roscommon Glen Mc, Glen McDonald, And now, Don Connellan, and again Don Connellan 's fouled He 's fouled by Gerry Sheridan, and Sheridan tends to use that option which shows a weakness in any corner back, giving away a free so easily I 'm sure that will be noted by opposition not only in the National League but also in the Ulster Championship So Nigel Dineen with the chance of the equalising score for Roscommon As I mentioned a few moments ago, it 's exactly what Martin McHugh didn't want, the four point half-time lead eaten away so quickly But the sides are now level Eight points each, one five to eight points, This 'll be a test of the character of the Cavan side, the only side in the National League who came into today 's game with a one hundred percent record, Seamus Donoghue, that heavy tackle there from Vinnie Glennon, the free kick is for Cavan It 's Seamus Donoghue There 's Larry McCormick, battling with the breeze Larry McCormick He gets it through to Adrian Lambe Another free for the Cavan men And Ronan Carolan will take this You wouldn't expect it to really be within the shooting range so he takes the quick one and it 's back to Carolan, and now it 's with Larry again Larry McCormick, but it 's given away And Roscommon could build from here, but first of all they 've got to get possession And the Cavan men close the door on them That 's a free-out for the blues, a free against James Hannigan, in favour of Aidan Connolly Aidan takes the kick himself out towards John Brady Most players getting more space now in the second half than they were allowed in the first, Doing well John Brady In danger of over-running, Cavan now confident that they can build another attack from here Adrian Lambe, can't find a way through Looking for support, comes in the form of who other than Stephen King And King 's fouled The Roscommon fans don't agree with the Leitrim referee Seamus Friar King leaves it to Carolan Cavan would like another score now, particularly now Cos they don't want to allow Roscommon to get in front And as I mentioned before, Ronan, he 's facing a very stiff wind indeed, Goes through the same routine, But it 's a missed opportunity and the sides are still level at eight points to one goal and five for Cavan Eight points Roscommon, one five for the visitors\n\n\n<$B> So Glentoran get this the second local Cup Final of the season underway Crusaders ' last Final was of course last year when they beat Bangor in the Ulster Cup John Hunter scored the winner then And the Glens haven't been in a final for a couple of years, that was the County Antrim Shield and they lost to Carrick in a replay Crusaders immediately on the offensive, and Armstrong has to come out and make a very good save Martin Dale hasn't cleared it yet, but George Neill should now, What a good opportunity immediately for the Crus, There 's the referee for this evening, David Magill, Hit by Dunlop, headed away by Parker Parker with the headband knocking it forward, That 's striker Duncan Campbell who replaces the ineligible Trevor Smith this evening Campbell on loan from Smith 's old club, Hamilton Accies, Another throw to Crusaders, Stephen Stuart I think will take that, Thirty-one years of age Stephen Stuart, in his ninth season at the club George Neill 's header, John Hunter gets a toe to that Stephen Baxter has it now, Baxter just trying to hold it up And he still has it as well, turns, and a foul says the referee, Indeed the referee doesn't give a foul there, Kirk Hunter 's header, George Neill 's long throw to Justin McBride to chase Cut out by Callaghan Free kick though says the referee Justin McBride wonders why, Eleven goals in twelve games this season for Justin McBride, Now that 's Robbie Lawlor at right back He fronts it forward Push in the back says the referee Free kick taken quickly George Neill 's in possession for the Glens, Nice one touch stuff from them Given away though, Another throw for Stephen Stuart, Thought about that quick one back to the keeper Kirk Hunter who, Gary McCartney number seven Nice turn by Hunter, A back flick by Hunter Baxter has it now for Crusaders And he 'll be a handful this evening I 'm sure Strong tackle by Darren Parker, Darren Parker who apparently had flu and then suspected appendicitis, but as you can see, he 's perfectly alright now, gets on with the game for Crusaders, I 'm sure they 'll move all their big men forward for this one, Sid Burrowes will take it And there 's the view from our camera behind the goal As you can see the big men have moved forward for Crusaders Kirk Hunter 's in there Good punch away, out as far as Murray Hunter got a head to that Here 's Burrowes Still danger for Glentoran, Oh lovely skill by Martin Dale, and away <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> by Campbell Campbell races up this far touch line Campbell, pretty adventurous shot A good stop from the on-loan striker, Well Glentoran 's first real chance of the game He 's got a bit of pace has Campbell He can strike it as well That one was well off-target, Well there 's the view that Neil Armstrong has the moment He 's at the near post all on his own Goal kick Gary McCartney can't manage to control, There is Gary McCartney, scored that superb winner of course in the Semi-finals against Linfield, Header by Lawlor Here 's Murray Nice ball out to Stuart who 's free on this near side Hunter 's touch doesn't reach him, Could have been a good ball by Stephen Stuart Robbie Lawlor just didn't move fast enough to get onto the end of it, Michael Smith, takes a throw for the Glens And that 's confused the defence And here 's a super chance He 's all on his own And it 's in Glentoran take the lead And Duncan Campbell is the scorer The Glentoran fans go wild, and rightly so Well there was confusion in the Crusaders ' defence And Duncan Campbell just scrambled through the defence and <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> What a start for the striker, Glentoran manager Tommy Cassidy says that Duncan Campbell isn't here for five weeks, he 's not just on loan He wants to have a future at the club, and he might well just have one after that", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Boxing - Rugby>\n\n\n<$A> The sound is just deafening here What a place this is for the world title fight And it may be an evening that Ray Close will never ever forget He 's had a workman-like final round and that was a good punch to Eubank The crowd responds, Exhaustion, fills the bodies of both men\n<$B> Both fighters Mark are very tired This is the man that 's doing the most in the twelfth round\n<$A> Ray Close is finishing this fight well He 's strong as a bull Oh incredible courage from both men, let 's be fair And has Close done enough Even Don King 's on his feet What a fight this has been Three seconds to go And that 's it It 's all over Both fighters feel they 've won it It 's down to the judges   But here at ringside , we think Close should get the decision\n<$C>  I think Close is  \n<$B> I believe that Ray Close tonight is the new superweight, <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> super middleweight champion of the world\n<$A> Well, if the atmosphere and the reaction of the crowd to the final bell is anything to go by, then we will have a new WBO super middleweight champion Barry McGuigan gives it to Eubank by three points Now I 've a lot of respect for Barry McGuigan as a fighter I find that hard to believe\n<$B> I, firstly think that that is way way way way out There 's no way If anybody has won this, this fight by three points it 's the man with the <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> in the middle of the ring up on somebody 's shoulders there,\n<$D> Three judges here tonight, Clark Sammartino from America, Jean Glenn from the USA and Roy Francis from England, who interestingly scored the fight in Glasgow a draw Now we must wait What a moment this is And what a fight Ray Close fought, Hugh Russell, Don King just in the round there I thought Barry Hearn looked a little bit worried\n<$C> Yeah the, Eubanks corner don't look happy at all I mean, I think Close has done enough to win it Eight thousand people in this hall think Close has done enough to win it But it doesn't really matter about us It matters about the judges, depends on how they 've marked it Eubanks has got a few dodgy decisions up to now so I mean I just hold my breath and just hope that he 's done enough\n<$D> They say, they say nothing comes close Look at this at the end That is close \n<$C> Great finish I mean both fighters deserve to be stood up and clapped I mean they stood toe to toe and they gave everything they had I think Close just done enough\n<$D> I know it 's a matter of opinion but to be fair, Dave McAuley as well and Mark they weren't too impressed with Barry McGuigan 's score card And to be fair, we weren't that impressed with it either\n<$C> No I have Ray Close the winner by two rounds He had a bad round which he could have scored maybe two points against him But there was a lot of the rounds were hard to score And I think there 's only going to be one winner tonight I hope that he 's done enough anyway\n<$D> We certainly hope so We look at the crowd One wonders what the reaction will be if the decision doesn't go for Ray Close\n<$C> I mean there 'll be a lot of disappointed people in the hall, nobody more disappointed than Ray Close I mean I think he thinks he 's done enough, his trainers think he 's done enough, I mean I think he 's done enough But I mean, we 're getting back to the the judges again It 's what they have writ on the paper that really counts\n<$D> Of course Eubank had a couple of great rounds mid-way through it, just you know in around about eight nine or so and he really, he showed his prowess, he showed why he 's the champion as well but Close responded very well\n<$C> Yeah Ray showed he had a lot of guts when he got hit and came back well\n<$D> Right, let 's hold our breath as we go towards the decision\n\n<$A> They 're right to be disappointed That was a bad decision\n<$C> Yeah I mean just look at the three judges ' score cards There 's none of them close to each other I mean they 're sitting judging on the same fight and one judge gives it one way one gives it another way I mean, there 's such a big margin I don't know what they 're scoring on You can't get away from it Eubanks is the golden boy of the WBO I mean he 's their kingpin They get more publicity out of him than any other fighter they have So to beat him they 're going to have to beat him well\n<$D> On the face of it that 's a very serious thing to say about the WBO and about their judges But clearly there was so many differences in the three judges whenever it came to the scoring\n<$C> Yeah I mean, it wasn't one point either way I mean one judge had it three points, one had it four I mean and then one scores it one way What are they watching for I mean sometimes they only look to see what they want Ray Close 'll be really disappointed\n<$D> Can you imagine how Ray Close can feel second time out and to lose again Well not lose but you know the first time the draw but to lose like this I looked at Barry Hearn just before the decision I thought Barry Hearn thought it was away\n<$C> Well I think Eubanks thought he was beat himself He wasn't looking a happy man It it 's not now, it 's later on it 'll sink in he hasn't done it and it 'll just, his heart 'll drop out of him\n\n<$D> Hugh Russell, amazing scenes at the end there Barry Hearn not interested, not too keen, worried about Barney Eastwood getting in a slanging match You know I think <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>\n<$C> Yeah they they got the judges ' score cards wrong they says but it 's still the same winner I mean okay the margin isn't just as big but I mean I think anybody, I think everybody in the hall 's disappointed I think everybody in the hall thought Ray Close had done enough tonight Uh unfortunately the judges didn't\n<$D> I also believe too when uh Chris Eubank said he didn't want to say anything controversial, as far as I 'm concerned there 's enough controversy\n<$C> There 's always controversy everywhere Chris Eubanks goes, you know, so uh I don't know what he 's talking about I mean the lad prepared as hard as he could, he 's getting a shot at the world title He done everything that Eubanks done on the night So what 's controversial about him and not about Eubanks\n<$D> Yes Ray Close said at the end, what do you have to do, and it 's a fair point\n<$C> Yeah I mean, I think he boxed equally as good as he did in Glasgow anyway I 'd go I 'd go I 'd go as far as to say that he boxed better Uh, I don't know What is there left for him I mean, is he gonna is he gonna have to do anything else Will he get another chance\n<$D> What about Chris Eubank for the future\n<$C> He, the show 'll just roll on I mean the man wants to fight regular I mean he 's going to fight and he 's going to handpick his opponents He won't get anything as hard as he got tonight\n<$D> Ray Close Bitter disappointment for him all the same Will he have to now step away and move away from the ring or will he keep going\n<$C> Well, the right men 's behind him and if there 's another chance to get another title fight they 'll get him it I think on tonight 's performance he deserves it\n<$D> Okay Hugh thanks very much That 's it from a very uh disappointed crowd here in the King 's Hall Lots of controversy but the bottom line is Chris Eubank is still the WBO champion From all of us here in Belfast, it 's goodnight\n\n\n<$A> Now Jonathan Bell That 's a good pass out to O'Shea And now can he release Geoghegan Well that 's one for Simon Geoghegan to chase here And he 's got a lot of pace And he 's there What a try for Ireland Well the referee, has he given it or has he not Well he hasn't My goodness Ireland feeling perhaps that they 're robbed there\n<$E> Jonathan Bell taking that ball and that was a clever pass missing out the man Now O'Shea might have chosen to give it early but he decided to draw in the fullback and put the kick forward That gave Simon Geoghegan an opportunity to sprint for the line He certainly touched it down I don't know what the referee 's decision was for\n<$A> It 's hard to tell what that was for Michael Bradley 's certainly confused Referee doing his best to explain\n<$E> Michael Bradley realises, that is a crucial try for Ireland With something like five minutes remaining that would have kept them in the match and still a chance of a victory\n<$A> Well I wonder has he given, he wouldn't have given the uh, penalty for, he hasn't for a late tackle Certainly advantage was the one to be played and that uh, that 's a confusing decision\n<$E> Inexplicable\n<$A> But Ireland have gained from that And over they go Oh they 've got their try this time Great play from Ireland They 're obviously incensed by the referee 's decision and big Neil Francis gets the touchdown Willie Anderson on his feet Well if ever an Irish side was incensed by a refereeing decision it was then\n<$E> Yes they they took it round the side at that stage Look at Michael Bradley, scrum half and he 's shouting onto the boys to drive and drive He 's putting the effort in as well The Irish forward 's coming forward onto that and at that stage Francis broke loose and touched down\n<$A> And I 'll tell you what, I 've never seen Neil Francis uh play as well as he 's played in this tour He 's been absolutely inspired He 's sometimes a little bit uh mercurial and  and inconsistent but uh he 's supported well, he 's tackled well He hasn't won too much ball in the lineout but he 's been all over the field A a well-deserved try for Ireland, Conor O'Shea, well, not a good conversion for Conor O'Shea and he grimaces\n<$E> Now that was uh an unfortunate uh miss there from Conor O'Shea If he had 've got that there 'd only be seven points separating the sides As it is, Ireland will now need to score twice\n<$A> Twenty-seven points to eighteen the score And this has been a spirited comeback indeed from Ireland, after Australia, looked like they were going to hammer them into the uh Sydney turf for the first twenty minutes, Ireland running it again That 's uh <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> the full-back, forward kick from him So what can Ireland do in this uh last few minutes They 've scored a couple of tries today both from uh forwards, Peter Clohessy in the first half and Neil Francis just a few moments ago And no doubt the Irish coaching staff will be a lot more happy after this match David Corkery knocking on there unfortunately, and a scrummage to Australia\n<$E> Uh that was unfortunate, uh Ireland trying that lineout for a second time, throwing long to Brian Robinson On that occasion, Robinson not attempting to catch but putting down a well-directed tap to David Corkery Uh I think in his uh enthusiasm to uh secure, he knocked on It 's unfortunate It now gives the Australians a put into the scrum, they 'll win that, it puts <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> in the driving seat\n<$A> Damian Smith is the man injured Queensland 's top try scorer for the last two seasons And he will play no further part in this match", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Heineken Cup>\n\n\n<$A> Well good evening to you Jack I think little Zach Ward somewhat overcome with emotion, and we all remember that wonderful night in the quarter final in December of nineteen ninety-eight against Toulouse when Andy got the call and he went over had a word with Martin McCall and then the then Chief Constable of what was then the RUC, Sir Ronnie Flanagan said, take my car Andy and off you go to hospital and Zach arrived Well he 's here tonight, he 's four years and a bit, and his dad is leading Ulster in this their forty-fifth Heineken Cup game and one of the most crucial in which they 've ever played A big night for Andy Ward, a big night for the faithful who as ever have turned up in their thousands and indeed more than tens of thousands The referee this evening from France, the man who did the Heineken final in the year two thousand, Monsieur Joel Dumet He 's been here at Ravenhill before but this is a huge night for both sides A win for Northampton is a must for them, a win and an impressive win for Ulster will be the only thing that will suffice if Ulster are to progress into the Quarter Finals, something they haven't done since they won the cup away back in nineteen ninety-nine Good thundering drive by Northampton right from the outset Vastly experienced pack remember they got, that 's a nice little chip into space, this could be awkward for Ulster Leslie hesitated slightly the skipper Dawson, clever use of the ball That was Mark Connors the Australian who played in the World Cup final in nineteen ninety-nine and that 's not a bad kick And Neil Doak, did he let that go over for the twenty-two Indeed he did That was a close call Philip\n<$B> Very close call indeed Jim, and uh obviously Northampton are setting out the stall plenty of variety We see Connors here actually chipping through uh and the chase is on and Neil Doak did extremely well getting back and just timing that to perfection to touch down\n<$A> Yeah Nick Beal was right on top of him So here 's uh David Humphreys, Ulster 's outside half, who 's also the top try scorer for Ulster in the Heineken Cup The wind just has taken that back and the Ulster side play on again says the referee Northampton almost claimed that on the ground, Well referee Joel Dumet saying in pretty decent English, you 're coming in from the wrong side Former Cantabrian Mat Sexton who has been in the middle of the Ulster front row all season, Ulster playing into a, a pretty , pretty stiffish breeze Back it came It was uh claimed on the ground by Sexton, oh yeah very definitely offside by Northampton, First uh crucial line out Wonderful take by Jeremy Davidson That was magnificent Rob Kenson does the tidying for Ulster But Northampton have restricted any Ulster forward movement That 's a little bit better, away they go Andy Ward, legs pumping Doak, Humphreys, inside to McMillan Northampton lining up for the young Ulster flanker Doak, referee I think has given the penalty but he 's playing the advantage Doak, Jeremy Davidson, still playing advantage Humphreys, Sheldon Coulter, beats the first tackle and the penalty I think is going to be given\n<$B> Well I think Mr Dumet had to bring it back at some stage He was giving uh Ulster every opportunity to uh make progress upon the  uh across the game line Initially started by Andy Ward but great support by the rest of the team So uh Ulster have this position just on uh the Northampton ten metre line playing into a very stiff breeze It 'll be interesting just to see what Andy Ward and David Humphreys decide to do\n<$A> Well tries of course are what Ulster really need as well as a victory but I think three points at this stage might just settle everybody and Ulster would get their noses in front And certainly during the week Alan Solomons was emphasising, yes we want to qualify but the important thing is to win this game\n<$B> The the win is is so important Jim, particularly uh at this stage of the season The points can uh we can look after the points as the match progresses So if uh David Humphreys can uh retain his composure, relax into this kick and and certainly put three points on the board it will settle this Ulster team down\n<$A> Well this would take David Humphreys to, by my reckoning, three hundred and twenty Heineken Cup points He hasn't wasted any time, he 's got right onto that Touch judges have a good look at each other and decide that was just slightly off-target Frank Marciano and Stefan Comaret\n<$B> Certainly had the length with that kick Jim, just a little bit uh off direction but uh David <unclear> several sylls </unclear> gets his timing right and uh makes very sweet contact,\n<$A> Paul Grayson just indicating that his forwards have got to be behind him Well he 's really gone for a bit of length Well taken by Humphreys There 's an air of confidence about David Humphreys so far this evening He 's given that a lot of height He needs red, men in red and white underneath him Well stripped in by Ulster Doak James Topping did well Well rescued by Doak himself The blue scrum half Topping obliges, Constable Not sure that Northampton have the straight offside Better work by the Ulster pack Good pick-up and drive Doak, Ulster keeping it fairly tight A bit of fancy footwork there But the penalty has gone against Ulster for holding on in the tackle And it may well have been Tony McWhirter the last man up\n<$B> Yeah I think the problem was there Ulster were trying to keep the ball very tight, use the tight channels and take the uh the confrontation to this Northampton pack Here we can see Ryan Constable trying to pop a ball uh but Tony McWhirter driving for it, Andy Ward again picking up uh and again it 's uh it 's Mat Sexton going forward not Kempson And uh here the drive and the momentum, Ulster just trying to recycle the ball quickly and it pops to Tony McWhirter Unfortunately a little bit isolated uh as James Topping pulls in but unfortunately just holding on that little bit too long\n<$A> Well the ensuing penalty has been put into touch by uh Paul Grayson Tony McWhirter, former skipper of the Ireland under twenty-one Triple Crown winning side That 's not a great line out for Northampton Andy Ward pulls it in, First knock forward according to Monsieur Dumet was by a green hand which is Northampton and Ulster will get the scrummage so an unchanged Ulster pack from the one that uh gave Cardiff the runaround last week Joel Dumet not happy that uh Northampton charged in That 's going to be a free kick cos they 're not observing <unclear> several sylls </unclear> study and engage rule Doak That was uh Simon Best who took it on for Ulster Good call by Humphreys Didn't make full contact Now this is uh Northampton 's top try scorer, big Ben Cohen And big Ben <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> straight into touch Not the sort of man you want to give the ball to Philip with a bit of room\n<$B> Definitely not But uh there 've been uh rumours this week about him uh being coached by NFL and if he shows that skill set I don't think he 'll be moving anywhere outside Northampton\n<$A>  well somebody from the  NFL reckoned that at six feet two and some uh sixteen odd stones he would make the perfect wide receiver But in American football you don't actually have to kick the ball at all which is maybe not a bad thing Sexton Good take by Longwell, nice variation again by Ulster Both their jumpers have won their takes out of touch Here 's Doak, Humphreys, Northampton up very quickly Shane Stewart 's just got across that game line Doak Well Northampton really swarming all over Ulster They 've worked hard on their defence all week I watched them at the Belfast Harlequins Club just uh yesterday afternoon when they spent most of their session in defence and this is a good drive by Ulster Neil Doak, now Humphreys, good call, Bryn Cunningham, taken by Jorgensen And they 've got to come all the way back for the penalty, and it 's a penalty to Ulster\n<$B> Good control by Ulster, again recycling the ball well, keeping it nice and tight, using the tight channels And then when the opportunity was right David Humphreys spotted the gap wide and tried to move to Bryn Cunningham\n<$A> Good work by the Ulster pack, a terrific piece of uh forward driving And look at the body positions of Ulster Alan Solomons and Adrian Kennedy will be well pleased with that Uh Northampton closing Ulster down very quickly indeed, Peter Jorgensen up first and the penalty was given,\n<$B> Obviously a little bit unsettling for David Humphreys there, the ball just knocking down so he just really needs to take his time and compose himself, a very important kick\n<$A> Not giving himself uh much of a run-up to it That 's another good strike into a stiffish breeze Will it hold It will hold but it hasn't again quite got the accuracy So two attempts from uh long range, two difficult angles Humphreys not too far away Somebody on the mobile phone there I think just uh telling everybody at home what 's happening Don't know why they 're  not watching this programme Well here comes Grayson Once again he 's given that a fair old thump This time it 's uh Bryn Cunningham Attempted a dummy which uh just about worked and no more Good support from Davidson now Humphreys That 's clever by Humphreys Well positioned though on the far side And Nick Beal has given that an absolute wallop And that is a terrific kick by Beal Northampton do it seems have the advantage of quite a stiffish breeze This is the former uh England fullback, capped fifteen times for his country and a member of the World Cup side in uh nineteen ninety-nine\n<$B> Yeah unfortunately for Humphreys there the ball just didn't really put  uh Doaks under any pressure Nick Beal was able to uh take his time pick his spot and use the elements to get a very very good and very effective touch kicking\n<$A> Sexton That 's another cracking take by Jeremy Davidson despite the attentions of uh big Steve Williams, current Welsh international This is another good piece of Ulster forward play They have the ball in their possession Doak For Topping to chase the wind might uh take it into touch Topping was underneath it but so too were three men in green and black Here comes Colin, Andy Ward with a tackle, Dawson, Grayson, Leslie the skipper, mis-move Beal this is James Brookes, Coulter went far too high, Grayson at scrum half Good little spell this There 's the dangerman taken by Gary Longwell, Tom Smith, wonderful soft hands from the front forward Smith at scrum half, Grayson on his own, looking for Ben Cohen Good challenge here goes Humphreys Came off the Northampton hand Humphreys might get to this first Wonderful piece of covering by the England international hooker Steve Thompson\n<$B> Well great pressure defence by Ulster Of course Grayson into the option of trying to chip for Ben Cohen And uh again here we can just see it, it 's it 's Grayson chipping over the top and the ball is just hanging up there Very very difficult for a winger to judge and there was David Humphreys just picking it up, looking at his options and then chipping it down to touch and it actually came off", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "49795386-2062-4c7b-adb7-c6228f7e5aec", "added":

{"text": "<Boxing Las Vegas>\n\n\n<$A> Great venue Great occasion Two great fighters Round two of this uh non-title light middleweight contest, but so much at stake Americans call it Junior Middleweight The hundred and fifty-four pound division Mosley desperate to get back to winning ways after two defeats One uh, by a fairly wide series of margins and one very narrow against Vernon Forrest Mosley known as Sugar Sugar Shane Mosley against the man in the red trunks He was using his head somewhat uh naughtily there Raul Marquez known as uh <&Spanish> El Diamante </&Spanish> The Diamond And he is as hard as a diamond , Marquez hands held very high This uh, thirty-one year old, it 's his thirty-fifth professional contest remember But since he lost to Vargos he 's had a series of well fairly nondescript fights against fairly nondescript fighters And there 's a lot of talk about he 's really just come here for the money and he doesn't have the same burning ambition that Shane Mosley has and that 's could been an an interesting factor Ritchie,\n<$B>  Again, the the first minute of this round Marquez starts, to get to work a little bit better  with the long jab and the straight the straight left And that 's mainly because Mosley 's waiting far too long on the outside Look it 's better for Marquez again there That 's literally because Mosley, waited too long and he 's allowing Marquez to work with those nice straight long punches \n<$A> Well that 's the second time Kenny Bayless has had a little word to uh Raul Marquez Fast hands once again by Mosley and going into the body Now one wonders will he be able to carry through the power that he had at lightweight up here to the light middleweight division He certainly looks solid enough and he doesn't seem to be carrying anything other than muscle, Good fast left hand from Marquez Mosley, in the corner where he probably doesn't want to be but he seems happy enough, And Mosley is reading that left of Marquez ' coming over very nicely and he 's slipping inside it Good solid shot from uh Shane Mosley the Sugar Man, And again great body shot with a right hand, Oh he 's looking so competent Mosley at this stage Had an iffy start to the round but he 's come back in style,\n<$B>  Again great variation of boxing there from Mosley with the upper cuts hooks straight punches as well, powerful shots He 's looking to step in, and to hurt Marquez Much better from Mosley Great reply, \n<$A> Marquez again tried to close the smaller man down, and take away that advantage of Mosley 's greater hand speed but Mosley 's really buzzing now He looking very confident even at this early stage of the scheduled twelve-rounder There 's that little clapper board indicates ten seconds to go to the end of the round And again Mosley gets him, gets outside that southpaw and then comes in with a very good right hand of his own  Good finish by Mosley And doesn't he look strong Ritchie\n<$B>  He looks very compact and and very powerful \n\n<$A> Bit of action from that round We 're just listening to some advice from, Shane Mosley 's dad Jack who 's been with him all the way through, Kenny Bayless not altogether happy about the way uh Marquez is behaving himself especially when it comes to breaking when told\n<$C>  Ten seconds out Let 's go  \n<$A> Two absorbing rounds gone and scheduled for ten more This is the third The man in the black trunks trimmed with gold Sugar Shane Mosley, won the IDF lightweight title in August of nineteen ninety-eight when he defeated the South African Philip Holiday Got himself caught there with a good left hand from the man in the red trunks Raul Marquez And then of course the most, astounding performance of his career came in June two thousand, when he beat the golden boy himself Oscar De La Hoya to take the WBC welterweight title, Marquez not happy indicating I think that Shane Mosley might just have butted him deliberately And there 's a bit of a, a cut there and it 's a nasty cut And Marquez saying that that was caused by a butt Well the doctor 's come over, Well Marquez uh leaving nobody in any doubt at all as to his opinion of what happened there That was a head butt he said Don't think Kenny Bayless could disagree with that Be interesting to have another look at it,\n<$B>  Well the heads certainly clashed It will be interesting to see When we slow down a little bit we 'll have to have a look because the way he was talking there Marquez he actually thought it was a deliberate butt But, I find that hard to believe from uhm a class fighter like Mosley but we 'll just have to wait and see \n<$A> Well Marquez is the man who 's got the reputation of being something of a real roughhouse fighter, And there again Marquez is not very happy about things And there 's time out been taken by uh Kenny Bayless,\n<$D>  Listen to my command I will start deducting points if it doesn't stop right now Understand Understand Alright touch gloves \n<$A> Well Kenny Bayless couldn't be more specific He 's not liking the way this contest is going, in terms of the uh, little faults by both men Lot of blood coming down the right-hand side of the face of Raul Marquez, mid-way through this third round Good left, by Marquez Good variation by Mosley going down to the body\n<$B>  I think the clashing stars as well means that the heads are going to rub at some stage cos Mosley has definitely got to get on the inside of this guy and so that 's going to bring the heads closer together \n<$A> And Mosley working very hard to the body, My sympathies to Kenny Bayless He 's really got his work cut out, with these two So much at stake especially for uh Mosley And for a man who wasn't meant to be motivated well Marquez is certainly making a fight of this And there 's the head rubbing I don't think that was so much a clash but Marquez very definitely, I 've a feeling trying to get some of his own back with the head, Good right hand came across by Mosley Didn't quite land on the target\n<$B>  Yeah and again there the <unclear> 2 syllables </unclear> the heads clash but that you know that wasn't deliberate But they certainly did clash again there so, it 's going to be interesting to see in the replay \n<$A> Well Marquez has turned away yet again And he 's not very happy Marquez Now what is Kenny Bayless going to do about this, Well that 's another head butt At least uh that was an accidental one That was uh Marquez was saying that was deliberate And Marquez now cut very badly over his uh left eye Well this really is extraordinary, Well, an accidental head butt And uh the rules are quite specific If it 's an accidental head butt then the fight has to be stopped And it may well be be declared a no contest or a technical draw And Mosley 's not happy with this at all because he hasn't been given the chance to showcase his talents Marquez I think with a fair degree of uh accuracy claimed that the first butt was deliberate but the second one was accidental And the contest has been stopped And Ritchie this is not the uh outcome that we certainly had expected or the one that either fighter would 've wished for\n<$B>  No you you just warming up to be a good contest wasn't it Was certainly a clash of styles And uh, as I said Mosley had to get inside I mean heads 're always going to be close in there cos literally the way these both these both guys were boxing But uh, it 's whether that first initial butt was was deliberate is the is the big question which uhm I don't think it was but uh we 'll have to wait and see what Well I don't suppose we 're ever going to really know but uh what a tragic end to the contest in a way because it was just developing   into a good fight \n<$A> Well Marquez could not 've continued with uh those eyes especially that left one in that state That 's a very very nasty cut right on the eyebrow And the blood was going to stream into his eye and block any sort of vision he had whatsoever So referee Kenny Bayless had no option but to call this one off Uh an accidental head butt so the contest has been called off, and we 'll have to see whether it 's going to be uh a no contest, uh or a technical draw, Well Marquez down Well there 's the bang and that might just 've been the first one And that 's the one I think that he complained about Well uh I don't know that he had a great deal of uh justification for that Rich What   do you think \n<$B>   No no   well if that was the first butt then I don't think that was deliberate at all Uh if anything it was Marquez who 's actually coming up with his head I mean that 's not deliberate butt That 's just accidental That 's just the the way the heads 've rubbed and uh, I don't think that was uh deliberate at all \n<$A> Well the smaller man trying to get inside the uh bigger man Marquez uh incensed by that uh fairly clearly but I think evidence would suggest that uh it wasn't deliberate This is the second one And there was a bang and that was accidental Now that was accidental Marquez, can't complain about that whatsoever And that really was the one that has caused the end of the contest So uh Marquez ' suspect eyebrows 've gone He came storming in and there 's the bang Nothing deliberate No intent on the part of Mosley whatsoever But how unfortunate indeed there for both boxers\n<$B>  Yeah it 's unfortunate And it and it was accidental because there 's Marquez He 's actually coming forward so it wasn't deliberate at all from Mosley \n<$C>  Gentlemen this bout comes to an end The official time is two minutes forty-one seconds of round number three As referee Kenny Bayless calls a halt to the action in the ring Raul Marquez suffered a wound too difficult for him to continue Referee stops the bout Four rounds must be completed to go to a decision Therefore this contest is called no decision \n<$A> Well not satisfactory at all Another couple of rounds it would 've gone to points But because it happened within four rounds it 's gone to a no decision And whether they will meet again or not we 'll have to wait and see, And Shane Mosley have to wait may have to wait a while longer for a crack for the second time at Oscar De La Hoya\n\n<$A> The vastly experienced Joe Cortez brings them together This could be a very interesting contest Antonio Margarito, the man in the white trunks with that uh green trim, making the second defence of his title Margarito hasn't lost a contest for some six and a half years, but he 's taking a fair old chance against another very experienced man now thirty-two years old Eight years older than him Andrew Lewis from Georgetown in Guyana and now resident in Brooklyn in New York, who 's only once in a good career and that was almost a year ago to the formidable Ricardo Mayorga, who recently deposed Vernon Forrest So the winner of this, WBO version of the welterweight bout might just get a crack at the ferocious Nicaraguan Ricardo Mayorga in the not too distant future Interesting contrast of styles Andrew Lewis one of those nasty awkward southpaws And Margarito has not been in against too many southpaws Lewis giving away a little bit of height and a little bit of reach But Margarito a very very accomplished boxer\n<$B>  Yeah he 's got a nice jab and a nice straight right hand has Ron Margarito He 's really got to time, the punch to perfection tonight, cos Lewis very quick at the feet Steps in Works works his punches in clusters and then he gets out so Margarito 's, got to be very precise and get that timing right with that right hand, \n<$A> Margarito, trained by uh Jose Valdes has come here, of a win last October his first defence against the very good uh Danny Perez won a unanimous decision in Anaheim just outside Los Angeles, With a right hand to the body from uh Margarito This scheduled remember for twelve three-minute rounds And Lewis as ever putting the pressure on He 's a little bit on the short side, but he 's trying to take away that height and reach advantage That was a good right hand went in by the uh Guyanan, Margarito looks a little bit out of sorts in this opening round Ritchie\n<$B>  Yeah he just got good head movement now and the work on the inside he 's moving his head well Just occasionally he turns southpawed It makes me wonder whether he has been a southpaw during his career at some stage, or whether he 's actually comfortable boxing both  orthodox and the southpawed style But uh now and again when they 're coming close you he change  to that uh  southpaw So uhm, Lewis 'll have to look out for that, \n<$A> Well Margarito is fighting a very  interesting contest at this stage He 's uh, decided to stand and trade He 's a pretty heavy puncher He 's won eighteen of his uh twenty-seven victories inside the distance But Lewis is a very formidable hitter Twenty-two contests, twenty-two wins I should say and twenty inside the distance Was another good little left hand coming through from uh Andrew Lewis the former WBA title holder And with all due respect to the WBO I think the WBA Ritchie would be regarded with uh greater prestige\n<$B>  I think so and I think this is probably uhm a  a stepping stone Quite well obviously both these guys will be looking at at a future fight with Mayorga No doubt about that \n<$A> Interesting opening round that for uh Antonio Margarito Didn't get it all his own way, And Javier Cavalito I think not altogether happy with that uh, opening three minutes from his man Antonio Margarito, A glance there from Joe Cortez <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> round Lewis ' corner, <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> saying to Andrew Lewis who 's the best and for quite a while he was the best Won his WBA title, two years ago stopping James Page So round two of the scheduled twelve-rounder for the WBO, welterweight title Antonio Margarito, didn't get uh anything out of his, first attempt to win this title But then in July of two thousand and one against the uh Puerto Rican Daniel Santos, and it was stopped after one round, cos Margarito had a very bad cut, due to an accidental head butt A lot of that coming And that 's good work by Andrew Lewis And his hands are that little bit faster And Margarito is a little bit lazy and a little bit slow especially with that left of his Ritchie\n<$B>  Yeah  Margarito has got to start uh reading the situation here because Lewis is just, he 's literally bluffing him with that that very light jab that he that he uses And and it is a distraction really because it 's what 's to follow that He 's just literally, uh pawing away with that jab very light punches but it 's what 's uh what 's coming after that the twos and threes afterwards that are more significant punches from Lewis \n<$A> Well this is the man who after ten professional contests moved from Georgetown in Guyana, having held his country 's, domestic title and he moved to Brooklyn in New York, and that 's been a very successful move for him But he 's now thirty-two years of age But you 've got to say that in most of the top half dozen divisions in the world seven out of ten boxers are thirty and over so it 's not a young man 's game That was better from Margarito More of a slap But Lewis is looking very confident He 's holding the hands a little bit on the low side though", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

path of Joe O'Kane Still Magherafelt gain possession, McEldowney the substitute kicks it, but kicks it wide\n<$B> And just as in the first half Jimmy when nothing seemed to be, go right for Maghera, uhm, but now Magherafelt are having great difficulty This was as good a chance as they 've had in this second half Uh, granted it was a substitute that hasn't been on the board very much, uh but in these sort of games that was a relatively simple chance\n<$A> It was indeed And the text number 's on the screen, o double seven six four three double five two o two for any messages that you want to send, anything you feel, you 'd like to say about this McRory Final, as Magherafelt move in again And it 's the Maghera defence that have really come out on top in this second half Gavin Scullion, plays that cross-field ball, driven in long by Lynch Nice strike, Brendan Mullan, scored a point earlier in this second half, and the big Dungiven player does it again\n<$B> Gerard O'Kane, instrumental in sorting this out A poor ball from uh Colly Devlin, picked up by the full back, moved out to Gerard O'Kane and then a good ball inside And Mullan was enjoying himself there\n<$A> Yes wonderful, the pressure off Magherafelt, <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> the substitute Off his chest Away it goes over the line\n<$B> He has made a difference in there Jimmy He 's certainly competed for ball, uhm he 's made himself available, and it has been and it 'll turn out to be a master stroke,\n<$A> This time it 's well spotted by Mark Collins Cathal Doyle, three Maghera men around him And certainly this second half has belonged to Maghera Those sort of passes were going crisply into the chest in the first half but now Magherafelt have no time to dwell the ball at all as Ruairi Murray drives that ball across to the middle of the field expect to collect again It 's Mark Lynch who 's taken down and out of it And he claims it was his shoulder It 'll be interesting to see what Mickey Convery thinks about it as he calls Ciaran McCallion to the one side\n<$B> Yeah I thought for a minute Jimmy that was Stephen Crozier who was booked remember for that challenge on Gerard O'Kane earlier on I 'd say he 's going in the book Uhm but I mean Maghera 's woes at this stage, Magherafelt 's woes at this stage cannot be simply put down to the breeze Their passing, uhm their composure, everything has changed from the first half But I mean all credit to Maghera They re-organised regrouped at half-time, uhm got their heads up and came sprinting out of the blocks, in what is after all a sixty minute game, plus injury time\n<$A> Yes and Aidan McGuckin in there having a word, about the tug on the jersey Yes we could see that clearly from here as Kevin Bradley 's jersey was held so it 's a free out for Magherafelt but it 's not frees Magherafelt need at the moment It 's scores and plenty of them\n<$B> Yes you 'd have to say Micky Convery in,  in what was possibly a difficult game for him uhm has missed very little Jimmy\n<$A> He has indeed Now it 's Niall McEldowney as the ball goes over the sideline Seconds ticking away, almost twenty-five minutes gone in this second half and Magherafelt have yet to score It 's been all Saint Pat 's Maghera They 've turned round, trailing at half-time by one four to two points, but it 's now they who lead by one nine to one four A goal and seven from them in the second half It 's that long hopeful kick from Charlie <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> Goes to the right of the post and wide but it 's purely academic at the moment The old phrase Peter that the wide is as good as a score certainly holds true\n<$B> Yes even even five minutes remaining and possibly one or two uh injury time, uh that keeps Magherafelt pinned back in their own half And they 're having difficulty getting constructive ball out of this half of the field\n<$A> Broken down again This time it 's collected well by Cathal Doyle Doyle is fouled, his progress impeded, but that 's all Maghera need to do, stop the man moving with the ball This time it 's Stephen Crozier An All-Ireland medal in his pocket, he thought that he would add a McRory Cup to it especially after the blistering first half that they had That 's Cathal Doyle is surrounded by three Derry players but Mickey Convery notes that while they stood over him someone put a boot in and there 's a free in then\n<$B> Well I must say Cathal Doyle has never stopped trying here He 's been on the ball a lot He 's been prompting and pushing forward, uhm, trying to make something happen\n<$A> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> Crozier, Crozier 's held Toal 's swung around Mickey Convery waves play on That 's about the only contentious decision today I think he was thinking about a bit of advantage They could easily have had a penalty Peter\n<$B> Yes Yeah\n<$A> And that would have been the reason why\n<$B> Yeah well Mickey Convery was on the spot, saw what was happening, uhm, maybe he thought he was going to get an advantage Here he goes again Well there wasn't any tugging Jimmy it was, you know it was clear momentum going forward that tossed him\n<$A> Sheer weight of numbers then wins the day Owen McNicholl in absolutely no rush, seconds ticking by, we 're in the twentieth minute of the second half as that ball is driven out <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> over the sideline Stephen Crozier 's there, the man who was up at the goal a moment ago is now back in his own half-back line Long ball, put in again, this time it 's John O'Boyle who 's there O'Boyle, loses out And I think that just about sums up the second half for Magherafelt Here comes Maghera pouring forward There 's a Maghera player down Still Maghera keep possession Through the middle they go, held up by their wing half-back Cathal Scullion 's kick however just drops into the hands of Ryan Kidd who tried to find McEldowney Can McEldowney keep it in He can He can't It looked from here as if he 'd done all the hard work So even the little things are going wrong for them   aren't they \n<$B>  Yeah  , like John O'Boyle losing that ball up in the corner uh in what, he seemed to be in perfectly good position That ball being just a little over-kicked by the keeper All those things begin to matter\n<$A> And it it 's just been announced that the man of the match today is Mark Lynch He was certainly man of the match in the Semi-Final, instrumental in setting up the goal which brought Maghera here So another award for the Banagher player as Maghera drive that ball in Three minutes left At least three it 's been decided so we have about a minute of normal time plus at least three of injury time And can Magherafelt do something in that short period It 's very very doubtful Or will Maghera hold on to collect their twelfth McRory Cup\n<$B> Well the only thing that 's going to make any difference to Magherafelt is is that they need to score a goal But before they do that they need to get the ball up into the the Maghera half of the field and they 're having difficulty with that now I 'll give a lot of credit to the Maghera players for their work rate, their tackling, uh their pressure on the defenders coming out with the ball\n<$A> That free played expertly into the path of the half forward So a substitute then for Saint Mary 's Magherafelt Chris Brown, or Conan Brown, son of Chris, is coming on He 's going to to replace Joe O'Kane So that 's Magherafelt 's third substitute, when he 's allowed out onto the field That should be any time because the ball has now gone dead But Maghera take the free too quickly so Conan Brown will just have to wait Magherafelt through their captain Ruairi Murray pouring forward again And young Murray seems to have picked up a cramp as play continues and Magherafelt win a free So seconds tick away We 're now over the thirty minutes, we 're now in injury time Rory McEldowney, or Niall McEldowney, his substitute will come on Certainly he 's worked as hard as possibly he could to try and pull this game out of the fire as Conan Brown gets a few last instructions from Eunan Conway on the sideline, So Ruairi Murray still being attended to again he went down after he kicked that last ball Looked to me like cramp And he 's certainly been one of Saint Mary 's more industrious players today Peter\n<$B> Yes he is a key player, obviously the captain uhm from left-hand back he has, he has tried his best to push things forward Uh I suppose that, the fact that he is suffering with cramps is a testament to the amount of work he has done Uh but Maghera have been fairly, have been good Jimmy at curbing his his attacking runs\n<$A> They have indeed And they 've been very alert in this second half and none more so than their corner back Paul Donnelly Donnelly has fouled, there 's a free out Yes, clearly signalled by Mickey Convery, Dermot McNicholl round the back of the goals Just as a player he 's covered every blade of grass that there is in Casement Park And Mickey Convery going to have a word with Murtagh O'Brien and I think you can you can just put that down to sheer frustration\n<$B> Yes I suppose the the cliche/s will be rolled out Jimmy about the game with two halves and so on, uh and I don't think it 's down, down to the wind Uh the wind hasn't been a big big factor, flags are dead really at this stage Uhm a much more purposeful performance by Maghera in the second half uh they 're bigger players, uh great courage from Gerard O'Kane to come back on, uh Mark Lynch found his feet, uhm and Michael Friel in full forward was a revelation in that first twenty minutes of the half", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ec69a0fe-06b7-4686-b88b-63b1d4b4aae2", "added":

{"text": "<Schools rugby>\n\n\n<$A> The referee for this Final as he was two years ago when Methody beat Campbell College is the principal of Newtownbreda Primary School, Derek Henderson, Derek Henderson blows his whistle and Richard McCloskey gets this, the one hundred and sixteenth Ulster Schools Cup final underway Methodist College in traditional white facing a pretty stiffish breeze, an indication of just how stiff that breeze is shown by the kick from Alistair Redpath, one of the seven Coleraine players in action for the second year in a row Gareth Bingham, the Methody full back appearing in his first final This indeed the fifty-third Schools Cup final appearance for the side in white with the navy Maltese cross, Methodist College Paul Curry the Ulster Schools hooker from Coleraine Inst for the first lineout of the afternoon Bit loose That 's Kettyle, to Callaghan, scrum half last year, a fine talented footballer That 's to Bingham, little readjustment Well there 's good stuff from Gareth Bingham now maybe that 's a little bit too much of, enterprise McCloskey, he hasn't found touch Roddy Wilson, breaks through one tackle, needs a bit of support from his pack Methody have won that Lively start Derek Henderson waiting for advantage, and no advantage coming to Coleraine, and Methodist College over the top and with a stiffish breeze behind them Chance of early points for Coleraine and for their skipper Darryl Callaghan Darryl Callaghan, top points scorer this season, nine points in the Semi-Final, And the first three of the nineteen ninety-two Ulster Bank Schools Cup Final with just three minutes gone, Darryl Callaghan the skipper puts his side into a three point lead but they 've got to build it up He 'll need a few more kicks like this with that wind behind him just to press home the advantage by half-time Good kick, It did look as if it went five metres Well won by Methody Good driving by Moore Kirk, that 's good stuff Finlay, crunching tackle in the back, and the entire of Coleraine 's three quarter line off-side and that 's going to give Methody the chance after ten minutes to level this game Ian Darby, the fifth former, the number eight holding the ball for Gareth Bingham An important kick this, because it brings Methodist College the holders to level terms, A great roar from the supporters in navy and white, and after ten minutes Gareth Bingham 's straightforward penalty conversion has brought it to Coleraine three and Methody three, That 's a good comfortable scrum for Coleraine, good strike by Curry Derek Henderson has a glance to see where the Methody backs are That 's Kettyle, Callaghan, oh great burst by Bell he needs support he 's got it from Colin Forsythe and the headmaster 's son scores at the posts Tremendous piece of control, the lovely little <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> pass and look how Alistair Redpath left it up for the full back Jonathan Bell And coming in  in support was the headmaster 's son Colin Forsythe and what a great try, Conversion by Callaghan and that 's just exactly what Coleraine needed, That 's how close they are, a matter of a metre or two Great Coleraine surge, that 's the way to repulse anything from the back row There 's Darby on the pick-up, looking for Morrison in support And the ball has come back on the Coleraine side albeit untidily Callaghan has sliced that Well taken by Bingham Thundering tackle Redpath picks it up That 's great support from Johnson the number eight, he 's very strong He needs a bit of help He 's got it now Great driving from Mark Waugh Good stuff from Coleraine Callaghan Nicely moved Bell waiting for the pass, well broken through by Barry Knox Is Callaghan the skipper, is Callaghan the skipper going to make the line The answer is yes, Well out of nothing whatsoever and no wonder the Coleraine supporters are absolutely ecstatic Thank-you very much It came from a breakaway Was a lovely piece of running now Barry Knox checked, stumbled, came inside and the Methody defence held off a little bit, Callaghan perfectly positioned and the man who played scrum half in last year 's final had the speed and the determination to get over at the post Great try, Callaghan himself, and Callaghan himself converts his own try and it 's now looking very good indeed for Coleraine Inst, fifteen points to three up And just over twelve minutes remaining of the half, Gareth Bingham restarts fairly quickly Keith Johnson the solid Coleraine number eight, bit of pace and a lot of strength Well Coleraine looking very confident Kettyle, that 's Bell, oh lovely stuff from Bell Tremendous support from the back row, and that 's great riding right through by the hooker Well my goodness Paul Curry may go all the way, and a knock forward at the last minute and Paul Curry, the Ulster Schools hooker who 's so quick it 's just not true, Well Paul Curry really picked that up and for all the world he looked like one of the centre three quarters, a lovely little show of the ball in the dummy, and he pinned his ears back and he went like the hammers, Methody have done a bit of reshuffling On this side with uh no number on his back is the replacement Martin McBryer who has come on for Gavin Morrison Well done by Methody That 's Darby Oh nice piece of pace by the number eight Little Peter Kirk That 's the replacement That 's McBryer Kirk, McCloskey Inside Callaghan Again the Coleraine defence very solid and they 've won that Callaghan, Redpath That 's Knox Oh he 's kept, he 's kept possession well now this could be a good chance here, and has he taken the wrong option Support from Keith Johnson, if he gives it it must be a try And that 's Gavin Wilmot who goes over and Coleraine starting to coast, Well Gavin Wilmot will be absolutely delighted about that Replacement in the final last year and he rounded off really a very straightforward three quarter movement It was Barry Knox who perhaps just overdid it but uh his little body swerve took him right through Jonathan Bell could have gone either way He came inside, fine pass and there 's good support from the number eight Well from this angle, slight hint of a forward pass but uh Gavin Wilmot waited until the whistle and the whistle indicated the try was good Callaghan with the conversion, no mistake and as we come up to half-time, Coleraine looking very very comfortable at twenty-one points to three ahead, Good strike by Martin the Methody skipper, a great surge by Coleraine It 's a bit laboured Finlay Now Colin Forsythe the first Coleraine try scorer was there to win it Callaghan Now there 's a chance here, as Jonathan Bell, now he has got a lot of pace, he did it all on his own against Bangor in the Semi There 's Keith Johnson, great support once again that 's Wilmot, out to Barry Knox A wonderful tackle by Adam Robertson for Methody Well my goodness, Coleraine exuding confidence that 's Callaghan That 's Bell That 's Redpath Gives it to Roddy Wilson who, can he get round Hilditch He can And that 's the fourth try and Coleraine have waited for fifty-three years although there 's the whole of the second half to go, really they 've played some wonderful wonderful rugby and at this stage deserve to win the cup And even look getting applause from some Methody supporters The pack it was, set it up It looked a little bit on the static side but it 's amazing how a wide pass can open things up A little floater from Bell to Redpath and Redpath showed enough of the ball to give Roddy Wilson a chance and outside Andrew Hilditch he went, Uh Daly Wells really just sits, has a wee look at the watch and thinks, well we 've got a, thirty-five minutes to come in the second half and who knows what might happen Jeremy Davidson loves to take on opposing packs even though it 's all on his own Arms flailing as hard as they can go That 's Moore Good stuff by Coleraine to repulse that drive John Hutchinson the tight head prop trying to rip the ball away, and this time Methody 's turn to go offside Knox, found a gap, that 's Bell who 's got a lot of pace My goodness he can certainly inject something can't he Lovely running by him Now he 's running away from the support and back inside, that 's Redpath who scored last year, that 's Wilmot looking for a second, he 's that close, and he 's over Oh the Methody defence really split wide open No wonder Coleraine celebrate Tremendous stuff And what a grin on the face of Gavin Wilmot A sub last year he 's come on and more than made up for it But it all started by this splendid splendid full back Jonathan Bell Now what a prospect he really is He opened up the defence as he did the Bangor defence in the Semi-Final, side-footing men left right and centre How 's that for a cheeky dummy Once again the whole thing opened up Alistair Redpath, a lovely transfer by him, and look at Wilmot, a little jink and over, and down for the try And Callaghan, says thank-you very much indeed, and Methodist College are trailing now by thirty-one points to three in injury time in the first half Five minutes of injury time played and Coleraine really making up for all those years in the rugby schools ' wilderness Darryl Callaghan, Andrew Hilditch, that 's a pretty good kick Well positioned by Callaghan, always stroked that absolutely wonderfully well Derek Henderson looks at his watch and decides that it 's not over yet Oh yes it is So half-time at Ravenhill and without a doubt the best first half of any Schools Final I 've seen even though it has been more than somewhat one-sided Coleraine Inst leading the holders Methodist College by thirty-one points to three, Gary McConnell, well taken by Methody Coleraine men getting in the way and uh Peter Kirk dragging McConnell out of it unceremoniously, Colin Martin nodding to his forwards and trying to keep them going One of thirteen players who 'll be back at school again next year from this team so don't be surprised if we see Methody in a fifth Final And what a good kick that was from Gareth Bingham, Right into the corner and this the closest that Methodist College have been to the Coleraine line since early in the first half at the other end, Back on the Methody side, Darby going for the line He 's only a metre or two out He scored in the Semi-Final Ian Darby, all in behind him Tremendous Coleraine defence, determined not to let their line be crossed, Well it 's only three or four metres but they 've got to get past that Coleraine pack Great surge by Methody, Darby holding and driving He 's trying to pick up, but once again Coleraine have got underneath them, and Derek Henderson is awarded a penalty try against Coleraine Well my goodness The Coleraine pack have worked so hard this afternoon, under a little bit of pressure there and how interesting that Derek Henderson should go for the penalty try It wasn't for collapsing, I think it was for coming in deliberately offside in order to prevent the score, so not collapsing but a deliberate offside and a penalty try awarded Gareth Bingham to add two points to the four for the try He does just that And from thirty-one three down at half-time Methody have come right back with thirty-one nine And would you ever bet against Methody at this stage In by Kettlye, good strike by Curry Well that 's untidy Peter Kirk has done well for Methody A bad clash of heads there Methody shunting forward That 's Jeremy Davidson And once again he 's got that long body of his down towards the ground Well won by Methody McCloskey missed out, that 's Finlay, that 's Doyle, that 's Bingham with Robertson outside him if he gives this it could be a try, Robertson 's a fair bit to do, and across comes Alistair Redpath yet again He has defended like a Trojan this afternoon But the danger still not cleared for Coleraine and Methody get the scrummage, They 've held that scrum well Darby, waiting for the pick-up He 's having a glance just to see where the line is Oh good control by Ian Darby My goodness the youngster only in fifth form has done splendidly Coleraine starting to detach Now if Methody stay down which is the sensible thing to do they can well get over the Coleraine line again", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2045e138-2a0e-4ffe-9de0-7571a25c85d0", "added":

bumbling into the back of him, Have to get a new ball Not often you lose a ball at a World Cup game but there you go, Northern Ireland coming here tonight of course very much the favourites even expecting a win and a convincing win at that Now we have two balls on the pitch And in the four games at home Northern Ireland only one win That was the three nil against Albania They 've had two draws against Lithuania and Spain, and then that defeat by Denmark But uh everyone Billy Bingham and his players expecting to win this one but at the moment they 're making heavy weather of it,

deflection and another corner kick to Northern Ireland Mal Donaghy lining one up there Eighty-fifth cap but still to score at international level And on a night like this well worth a try Magilton takes it Dowie 's at the back Just couldn't climb high enough Iain Dowie The long long ball, Dowie up, and off the target, Jelisejevs ' header Sarando The ball beats him and Fleming Northern Ireland settle for the throw in Sarando one of the men who play in Sweden, Dowie <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> Magilton Only Hughes up front at the moment and he finds him Hughes covered by Ivanovs The crowd don't like the impact with Hughes Latvia have it The chance of a break Babicevs waits for support Finds it in Popkovs Babicevs again comes left to Linards, who 's been quite subdued so far this evening They really had a good game in Riga There 's <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> to Troickis A long long ball Fleming gets the header <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Fleming gets it back Wilson <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Gray making ground Hughes He 's got Gray in the middle He 's got Dowie in the middle Gray tried to get back, Ball in Gray arriving, but no trouble And Gray looking

{"text": "<Queen's visit>\n\n\n<$A> Good morning from Belfast, on a cold but bright morning, and you join us live from the new Cross Harbour Bridge Since January the twenty-second, it 's been open to traffic and up until nine o'clock this morning it was helping thousands of commuters get into work on time But now people have replaced cars and lorries There 's an air of quiet expectancy because in a few minutes ' time the official ceremony and the naming of the two Lagan bridges, one road, one rail, will be carried out by Her Majesty the Queen These two constructions, the largest and most significant transport project ever undertaken in Northern Ireland, have dramatically altered the city skyline and helped to ease Belfast 's congested road network The Queen is due to touch down around now at Belfast City Airport She 's then due to travel by car along the Sydenham Bypass towards the east side of the bridge And while we are waiting for Her Majesty to arrive, let me introduce you to Chris Ryder, who joins me in our commentary box\n<$B> Well good morning This uh there 's a very relaxed atmosphere here this morning, uhm there 's a very distinct lack of the oppressive security that has surrounded royal visits in the past Uhm apart from uh uh police  around the area there are no road blocks through the city and uh there are uh some armed police on rooftops and buildings around Uhm and there 's no military involved I mean no sight of soldiers anywhere except for half a dozen boats in the river and uh again the uh personnel in those who include many women uh wearing uh life jackets and not flak jackets and there 's no sign of them carrying rifles Uhm there was uh a fairly intensive security operation overnight, uh when the area was cleared by bomb disposal teams and search dogs and then a a very low-key police presence was put in was put in position to uh uhm guard just the direct vicinity of the bridge where the ceremony is taking place And uhm the uh, compared to the nineteen seventy-seven Silver Jubilee, there 's a much, a very relaxed time indeed\n<$A> Indeed these are these are policemen who are in the boats uh in in the water uh around us here  and not soldiers It 's very obviously an operation that is being looked after by the police,\n<$B> Yeah the uh, there there are a number of women officers on board too And these are darting boats that are used for waterway patrol by the security forces throughout Northern Ireland And uh\n<$A> I also think it is a sign of the times Chris isn't it that that as we look out from our commentary position here uh around the city, life is going on very much as normal   I mean  traffic 's still moving freely over the, the nearby bridges where\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B> Yes as one looks out over the Queen Elizabeth Bridge and the uh, the Albert Bridge and all all around the, the main fringes of the city centre here there 's no traffic congestion despite the fact that the Sandy Row Bridge is closed for the, several hours that the ceremony will take And uh the the uh life goes on very much as normal Uh we 've got uhm then people who have been invited here onto the bridge to watch the ceremony to see to see Her Majesty the Queen arrive, and uhm it 's notable that they include representatives of the Nationalist minority community It 's a measure of how things have changed in Northern Ireland really in the last twenty-five years that we can see a a genuine cross-community uh uh attendance here at a function like this today\n<$A> Four schools have been uh specially invited Uh they are pupils from Stranmillis Primary in South Belfast, the Edmund Rice primary school, Seaview on the Shore Road and uh Saint Michael 's on the Ravenhill Road There they are, some of the children from Stranmillis uh waving at our camera as we speak about them The world 's press is here as well Uhm, there 's great interest in this because uh this is the first time in so many years that the Queen has come to Northern Ireland uh at a time of peace and quiet Uh it 's her eighth visit to the Province The last time that she was here was in June nineteen ninety-three as guest of honour at the Secretary of State 's garden party at Hillsborough Castle There are many uh adults here as well They are people who have come from nearby offices, uh people who are curious and uh who want to see this, this momentous occasion which is unfolding before us, uh this morning as we speak\n<$B> Yes it 's it 's interesting too that there 's been a lack of controversy about uh  this function The uh when the Queen arrived in nineteen sixty-six to name the Queen Elizabeth Bridge which is just a hundred yards away uh it was the culmination of of much political wrangling here in the city The Unionist-controlled Council at that time, wanted to call the bridge after Lord Carson and uhm there was much procedural manoeuvring  in City Hall At one stage the governor 's secretary uh actually rang uh the town clerk and said that uh it was inappropriate for Her Majesty to be drawn into this political controversy And when the uh City Council came to decide on the name it was actually a Catholic Republican Labour councillor who seconded the motion that it should be called the Queen Elizabeth Bridge and not the Lord Carson Bridge And thus, thus uh Her Majesty came in nineteen sixty-six to name the bridge in her honour\n<$A> And that 's the bridge there just in front of us, uh which is now in fact congested with traffic uh so clearly something is happening not too far away from us That 's the Queen Elizabeth Bridge there that she opened in nineteen sixty-six\n<$B> Yes that 's just that 's just uh literally adjacent to us and in between of course we 've now got the new Lagan Weir, which is a central part of clean, the the the policy to clean up the river and and develop the the upper reaches uhm  along the city with Many people have regarded it as a neglected asset for a long time It 's it 's also interesting that, that this is now uh this area on on the River Lagan is taking on a new significance as a transport interchange because for many many years uhm all along the quayside here was uh where the overnight  ferries went off to England and Scotland And this was in the days before air travel We would have had four boats going out of Belfast every night to uh Scotland and uh Heysham in Liverpool and uhm Ardrossan and uhm the Isle of Man and of course these were a vital lifeline for Northern Ireland in those days because of the uh kind of absence of air travel, but in the nineteen fifties all that declined\n<$A> As we 've said already the Queen is no stranger to Northern Ireland Uh she was here within being a few weeks of being crowned and included Northern Ireland on her itinerary during the Silver Jubilee tour in nineteen seventy-seven So let 's now take a brief look back at some of Her Majesty 's previous visits\n\n<$A> We can assume that this is the, the cavalcade\n<$B> Well it 's certainly the preliminary part of it Uhm the the uh, the royals will probably be travelling in limousines,  these appear are, obviously in VIP cars Perhaps it 's the the Chief Constable the GOC the Secretary of State\n<$A> In fact there 's the Secretary of State now\n<$B> Yes he would have been welcoming uh Her Majesty on the tarmac at uh Sydenham Uh they would obviously be arriving now to get into position\n<$A> In fact the Queen is just getting out of the car as we speak and uh she is being greeted by the Lord Lieutenant of Belfast, Colonel Helliot Wilson, uh now being introduced to the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Alderman Hugh Smith, And the Queen is here with the Duke of Edinburgh this morning She 's now meeting Mrs Smith, Mrs Helen Smith, the Lord Mayor 's wife, and is now being introduced to Brian Hanon, chief executive of Belfast uh City Council followed by Joe Hendron the MP for west Belfast, uh beside him is Peter Robinson the MP for east Belfast Uh two different sides of this bridge uh span two different constituencies, east and uh west of the city And the traditional posy of flowers as well being presented to the Queen by five year old Charlotte Choppinger, daughter of uh senior executive of the airport known as the Shorts Bombardier group, The Queen is now going to walk uh about eighty yards or so up to the area up to where the plaque will be unveiled and in doing so she is going to be walking past the school children who 've been waiting here uh and also to the people from the nearby offices, She looks well this morning Chris\n<$B> Yes she looks very relaxed and uh clearly uh the relaxed atmosphere I think has has uh has contributed to the the the gentle informality that we 're now going to see on this visit Uhm it 's uh not been the practice in the past for the Queen to be uh exposed to a walkabout like this which would be a standard part of royal visits everywhere else And I think it 's, it 's a reflection of the dramatic changes that there have been in the situation in Northern Ireland in the last six months\n<$A> She was also insistent that she 'd come here in nineteen seventy-seven during her jubilee tour as well   It  says something of of, of the bravery of the lady   because  she was determined to come\n<$B>  Yeah  \n<$B>  Yes when  \n<$B> The Queen has has uh felt a a tremendous uh, uh, affection for the people of Northern Ireland and she has spoken many times of her admiration for the way that they have coped with the difficulties of the conflict uh  in the last twenty-five years She 's referred to it in many of her Christmas broadcasts and I think there was a feeling that was reinforced by the Secretary of State Roy Mason at the time that it would be a mistake to leave Northern Ireland out of the Silver Jubilee tour round the countryside And despite all the immense security problems she came and the visit went off without with any major incident whatever,\n<$A> There 's virtually no barrier here at all between Queen and people\n<$B> No, just the normal uh crowd <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> barriers that one would see everywhere and uh there is not the oppressive security that one would have expected in Northern Ireland even when we had prime ministers here in the past doing this sort of thing in the city centre The security has been much more oppressive\n<$A> I think that since we are running very much to time we were told that uh the Queen would be here at around ten past eleven or so, uhm that she can take her time as she walks along here and spend time talking to these children, accepting the gifts of flowers as well\n<$B> Yes we can see the lady-in-waiting there has already relieved her of some of the bundles,\n<$A> Uh we have reporters uh down with the people this morning who have been uh meeting and chatting with the Queen as she has passed by and no doubt we will be able to hear from them later on uh exactly what was said to to the people in in Belfast on the bridge this morning\n<$B> Yes the Lord Lieutenant appears to be pointing out some of the landmarks   on the uh Belfast Lough to Her Majesty She 'll of course be well familiar with this part of the city, not only having opened the Queen Elizabeth Bridge but, uh back in nineteen fifty-four when she was only had been Queen for two years, she visited the Harland and Wolff shipyard and she launched the Southern Cross which was one of the last big passenger liners ever to be built here in Belfast", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "<Clinton - Daly>\n\n\n<$A> Paul I swear you can almost touch the excitement here at this City Hall I mean the scenes here are quite amazing No matter what direction you look all you can see are people Eamonn Holmes has just given an estimate that there are fifty thousand people here I think that 's way off beam, very conservative estimate It seems to me that there 's probably nobody watching us at the moment because the gang 's all here One person who 's not here just yet, Bill Clinton, he 's on his way, he 'll be very, very soon he 'll be here But in the meantime there 's been a star-spangled warm-up bill for our star-spangled Bill We 've had John Anderson 's Big Band rounding off a very big day for John Anderson cos as we all know, he 's the director in UTV And he 's been calling the shots in our coverage of Bill Clinton 's visit before rushing down here to become the main attraction himself We 've had Kieran Goss  from Rostrevor, Curtis Stigers is on behind me now, we 're waiting for Van the Man and possibly, that sax duet with the President The rumour factory 's also been working overtime here Barbara Streisand 's supposed to be here, Paul Newman, I 'm just waiting for Elvis and Lord Lucan to come on for a duet But only minutes away from the President 's arrival, so we 're all looking forward to it here so I 'll hand you back to the studio\n\n<$B> Well those are the uh pictures that are live at the moment from the City Hall, the John Anderson Big Band playing there and putting people in the mood And we are still waiting for the star of tonight 's show to arrive Uh I 'm not sure if he 's actually back in Belfast yet I 'm sure he must be at this stage And uh when he arrives into the centre of Belfast he is going to see the biggest crowd of his trip to Ireland so far Uh those are just remarkable pictures to see the crowd stretching all the way back to Castle Junction there And uhm those people will have difficulty if they 're trying to see the President through the naked eye, but I do understand that there are big screen monitors all around the whole area So even though they may be some distance from the action at the front of the City Hall, they will be able to see everything that 's happening on the big screen You will be able to see it at home as well and uh can I just tell you that if you were expecting to see your favourite programmes you 're not going to miss them Uh we 're staying on air until a quarter past seven, maybe half past seven and uh after this programme we 'll be joining Emmerdale and you will also see The Bill, uhm tonight 's movie Unlawful Entry you will see at nine o'clock as well Now it means that the pictures we had hoped to show you live from the Whitla Hall at Queen 's University we will be incorporating into a UTV Live special between half past ten and eleven o'clock tonight So uh there is uh an undoubted air of expectation and anticipation at the front of the City Hall this evening as we wait for the President of the United States to uh arrive Ken Reid,  these are spectacular scenes\n<$C> This has been a remarkable day I mean Bill Clinton has come in today and I think he 's touched the population His message has been so powerful I have to say that many people were expecting this would be an economic day or a day of economic announcements It 's been a very political day for peace He said that the the time for guns, that 's over He wants everybody to show the courage, to go ahead and to back peace Uh it 's also uh I think the fact that he visited the Shankill and the Falls, he met the SDLP leader John Hume, he paid great tribute to John Hume, tonight he 'll meet David Trimble and uh he 'll, in fact we hear that David Trimble will be in the car with Bill Clinton leaving the Whitla Hall Uh he will also meet Gerry Adams again, he 's already shaken hands with him, we 've seen that So really in political terms Bill Clinton is playing a blinder\n<$B> And of course he like everybody else would have been touched today by the comments of those two children who read from their letters at Mackie 's this morning\n<$C> Well I think that, we were saying earlier today, the theme of this has been, to politicians and the people here of the current generation, get on with it Uh and he 's used the image of children the whole day to show that well it 's this generation we 're talking about Give a future for your children It 's been very impressive Uh I think that nobody could help but be moved by the images that we saw in Mackie 's factory this morning\n<$B> And of course those are images which uh do not just appeal to a Northern Ireland audience but they would have gone right round the world\n<$C> Oh yes I mean, uh one of the things to remember is that this is also aimed at Bill Clinton coming into an election and uh this is really the start of his election campaign And I have to say the polls in the States show that he has actually a very good chance of being re-elected Probably better now Of course the danger with backing something like Northern Ireland is what happens if the thing falls down in the future So there is a political calculation\n<$B> Yes okay we can join uh Eamonn Holmes, uh he used to work at UTV with us, now uh GMTV, uh as he brings the people of the City Hall up to date with what 's happening next\n\n<$D> Well as we see, the President is now arriving out at the front of the City Hall John Anderson is going to be cut short this time Ken what do you reckon\n<$C> Well I see that Bill Clinton 's coming with uh Eric Smyth who of course is the Lord Mayor of Belfast, very proud moment for him And Bill Clinton, he 's had an ecstatic reception in Derry and now here in Belfast he 's uh thousands of people  Ivan uh Little said that Eamonn Holmes had said fifty thousand it appears from here anyway, to be much more than that So it 's uh really a case that Belfast is out in force to welcome Bill Clinton\n<$D> Truly truly incredible and like a true musician that he is himself he let the band finish\n<$C> Yeah, Big day for John Anderson as well\n<$D> It is yes Working with you today\n<$C> That 's right , Again we see as we have all day the uh <unclear> several words </unclear> , You 'll notice here that the glass screen has been erected in front of the City Hall This is some idea of the security precautions that have been taken\n<$D> Five inches thick I believe\n<$C> So they say But uh I don't think it 's affecting anyone 's enjoyment from what we see And here he is again, Bill Clinton, the man of the people today\n\n<$D> Well the Clintons there leaving the stage with uh the Lord Mayor, Eric Smyth They 're heading off to the Whitla Hall where there is a large political gathering for dinner They will be uh sitting anxiously waiting because the uh President is running over time Meeting a few people in the crowd on the way through, but I think it was a very very momentous day and uh tremendous speech once again by the President who must by this stage be absolutely exhausted, Well that is an absolute security man 's nightmare there Ken Recognise a few famous faces in the crowd there too\n<$C> Yeah, I see a few journalists that I would know But I mean,  let 's uh just reflect for a minute, I mean uh this is fantastic stuff really, well you can see the reaction But I have to say Bill Clinton once again said the Americans will admire those who take risks for peace That 's been his message Bill Clinton, the peace-maker And my word, isn't he having an effect there\n<$D> Uh he uh he 's had a truly wonderful, he seems to be thoroughly thoroughly enjoying himself in Belfast He must be used to receptions like this\n<$C> Yes but I this is rather special I mean I I have seen myself Clinton working in America and, it 's it 's very good But I mean today, you can see the man, the man is exhausted\n<$D> Well as we said, it 's been a truly tremendous day Uh Emmerdale Farm will be following, that 'll be followed by Barrymore My Kind of People We 'll have highlights of an exceptional day That 's at half past ten But from all of us, good-night\n\n\n<$E> John Gates brings the letter over to give to the new Archbishop, who in turn, will present the apostolic letter to Dean McDuff, Now the new Archbishop will be escorted to the chair behind him, the red chair behind him It 's called the cathedra, that 's the chair which gives a cathedral its name And by taking his place at the cathedral in Armagh, the Archbishop is symbolically taking his place as bishop of this archdiocese, An archdiocese which includes County Louth, almost all of Armagh, parts of Tyrone, Derry and Meath Archbishop Daly, is being given a crosier, a gift from the priests of this archdiocese\n<$F> The crosier like the book of the Gospels which comes next, the two symbols of the office of the Archbishop The shepherd 's staff This particular crosier is very old and was given by John Donegan of an old Dublin firm of ecclesiastical metal workers The wood in the crosier came from the Valley of the Seven Churches at Glendalough And it was given first to Archbishop Joseph Dickson in eighteen fifty-two,\n<$E> And that there is the book of the Gospels being given to the new archbishop by the Reverend Liam Doherty,\n\n<$F> Monsignor McLarnon the Dean of the archdiocese just greeted and welcomed Archbishop Daly to Armagh, and he 's joined now by the Canons of the Armagh Cathedral, who wear the same robes as the Canons of the Pope 's own cathedral church in Rome, the Basilica of the Saint John Lateran That dress is unique in the British Isles Besides the Canons of the cathedrals then there will be representatives of the senate of priests in the archdiocese with whom the new Archbishop will work closely\n<$E> This shaking of hands is a, a rich means of expression We shake hands with friends, we embrace those we love It 's a human thing to communicate something of ourselves by touch And of course, it is the imposition of hands which is the essential act of making a new bishop But we 're not making a new bishop today because Doctor Cathal Daly has been a bishop since nineteen sixty-seven and so this ceremony today is, is a more simple and and straightforward affair than the installation thirteen years ago of Toma/s O'Fiaich,\n<$F> These now are the priests who are the elected members of the diocesan senate of priests The deacons went just before them to make their welcome And after them will come representatives of religious orders and the lay people of the diocese,\n<$E> Sister Catherine Dwyer from the Convent of the Medical Missionaries of Mary at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda The last of the representative cross-section of people from within this archdiocese welcoming the new Archbishop,\n\n<$E> We now come to the Liturgy of the Eucharist, beginning with the procession and the preparation of the gifts Four of the six people in this procession were chosen to highlight the geographical spread of the archdiocese Doctor John Tohill from Magherafelt representing the most northerly parish, Mrs Bridie Magee from Carlingford the most easterly, Barry Grimes from Beragh in Tyrone, the most westerly parish in the archdiocese and Miss Lisa McCarron from Drogheda, representing the most southerly parish They bear the water, the wine and the flowers to the sanctuary, In the box is the Loughguile Chalice carried by Frank McCloskey, a gift from the Archbishop 's home parish It is silver made by Sean and Christina Steenson of Glenarm, and the stem contains bog oak from the Antrim Hills On one side is the Archbishop 's motto, and on the other, a replica of the old church in Loughguile and Lissanoure Lake The chalice will be used in the consecration, And Frank McCloskey was chosen for the task uh for two reasons He 's the principal of Saint Patrick 's primary school in Loughguile, and Saint Patrick 's was once two schools, the old Loughguile Primary and the Magherahoney Primary School where Doctor Daly 's father was once principal And Mr McCloskey is originally from Pomeroy which is within the Archdiocese of Armagh And the last of the gifts was presented by eleven year old Oonagh Corrigan who 's a pupil at  Mount Saint Catherine 's Primary School in Armagh She carried the chrism She 's a member of a long-established Armagh family, and will be confirmed next year\n\n<$E> As the procession moves down the aisle the organist plays Come Holy Ghost by J S Bach This piece inspired by a Lutheran hymn is from the first of the Leipzig Chorales and the fiery musical figures represent the tongues of fire, the manifestation of the Holy Ghost as it descended upon the apostles This installation has brought together Catholic and Protestant churchmen, British and Irish government ministers, Nationalist and Unionist politicians It is a positive reflection of what Doctor Daly has said are his priorities, ecumenical dialogue with Protestants, and continuing to work for an end to violence and for justice", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "82880e03-264a-47c2-80b4-02aed4783cab", "added":

first half Switching it in James McCartan getting on to it fast And he sends the ball inside towards Greg Blaney Mick Lyons, making the first clearance Out to Gerry McEntee who takes up a good position Terry Ferguson Well away from his left quarter, back position The marking arrangements for Meath at the back will be interesting, as Beggy plays it across towards Coyle who had to stretch out for that one Stafford, up towards Bernard Flynn Meath coming looking the first for the first point, and won the first free kick David Burns, the one who commits the foul David Beggy and co have the chance here to go in front Brian Stafford, scored nine points in the Semi-Final It 's the first of the afternoon, Always looks most relaxed, and absolutely deadly from frees, Possession in mid-field for Gerry McEntee He 's fouled, bottled up there once again by Eamon Burns, In towards Liam Hayes Burns trying to get back Bernard Flynn, Against Brendan McKiernan Still Flynn, coming looking for the second point <unclear> several words </unclear>, That 's a very good start by Meath imposing their will upon the Down backs who are being very slow to settle, Mickey McQuillain 's kick right into the middle Mopped up here well by Paddy O'Rourke the team captain Across towards James McCartan who once again has switched back in there, trying to make his presence felt Oh that 's a high challenge for Brendan Riley\n<$C> Uh James McCartan here is causing a lot of problems for the the Meath full back line Liam Harnan a very high tackle there and very very lucky I think to get away without a booking on that occasion\n<$B> The referee was absolutely spot-on it was Liam Harnan, So it 's knocked over by Gary Mason, and Down get their first point in this All-Ireland final, Mickey McQuillan here never looks fussy when making a save Always very secure and uh never unduly spectacular, This young Down fella I think will remember his day out at Croke Park Oh a huge, leap in the air by Ross Carr taking it with some difficulty against, Martin O'Connell It 's given away to Gerry McEntee Blocked down by Greg Blaney Taken now by Liam Harnan, Fed forward, towards Bernard Flynn, who 's taken up a roving commission early on It 's Harnan once <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> again stepping into the breach Another foul, Meath 's third free kick Dropped deep towards P J Gillic and it 's, fetched in there splendidly somehow by the full-back Conor Deegan Had the presence of mind to link up with his goal-keeper Neil Collins He 's given it away to Liam Hayes coming racing through the centre In towards David Beggy on the edge of the small square Fed back towards Brian Stafford There 's a man loose that was Bernard Flynn But he couldn't get it to him Instead he 's put it wide Meath 's first wide of the match Down with one wide as well That from the free kick by Gary Mason earlier on Harnan takes the free, Taken down nicely Burns, Brendan Riley going for the first <unclear> several words </unclear> But James McCartan has got there The referee says play on or does he No he 's whistled back the play for the foul by Mick Lyons The referee seemed to have allowed an advantage initially, <unclear> words </unclear> two points for Meath Two points for Down, Martin O'Connell Dropped in Gillic touches it down, to Stafford, and the old one-two And Stafford gets his second point of the afternoon to restore Meath 's advantage Oh he always is waiting around there waiting for the break of the ball That was touched down splendidly And Stafford did the rest Mickey Linden coming out for this one Secure catch And then he takes a high one to the face from Kevin Foley I think Gary Mason, plays it down Greg Blaney coming in Gets by the, hard challenge And the referee whistles and signals it 's going to be a free All this while Mickey Linden is down injured having made a good secure catch I think he got an, elbow in the face,\n<$C> Yeah here we see there Mickey Linden getting the ball but here we see Kevin  oh very high tackle there Uh, a few of the Meath players have got away with a few high tackles so far and lucky to get away with those\n<$B> So it 's going to be a free kick And Gary Mason has the chance to level up the match He 's Down 's only scorer so far, It 's three points each, Just over fifteen minutes gone in the first half, David Beggy Breen the one who 's coming in to make a challenge Cross towards Brian Stafford Out-marked however And it 's Burns that chips it away towards Gary Mason Kevin Foley there too for Meath Now Tommy Dowd, looking up spotted that uh the corner forward Bernard Flynn had made a run across A good passage of play by Meath Liam Hayes kicking very slowly And the team captain has put it over the bar And Meath go back in front again Hayes 's

O'Connell and Colm Coyle O'Rourke inside, to Greg Blaney, nicely fed forward to Eamon Burns And Down go in front for the first time in the match They were behind by two points initially Came back And then they 've swapped points with Meath ever since But this is the first time they 've gone in front, Hayes competing with Burns Beggy, a man free outside him on his right-hand side One on his left as well as Gillic Coyle, steadying himself with a shot but it, falls short into the arms of Conor Deegan Deegan out towards Greg Blaney There against Liam Harnan It breaks down to Colm Coyle Meath so good at waiting for the breaking ball And expecting it to come their way O'Connell Stafford It 's a Meath side working very very hard for all their scores this afternoon Under some pressure Comes down off the post Back down to the secure hands of D J Kane, now John Kelly Plenty of altitude Harnan <unclear> words </unclear> too much time to watch that one It 's going to be a free for Down Greg Blaney wants to take it quickly Across towards Mickey Linden, trying to get inside Terry Ferguson It 's with Withnell Lyons standing back from him Now putting in the challenge Reaches James McCartan And Down lead by two points Well he 's looked the liveliest so far on the inside forward line He looks as though he could do an awful lot if he gets the right kind of ball He 's got his first point in the afternoon Liam Hayes reaching up, happy to see P J Gillic who was uh programmed at mid-field but because of Colm O'Rourke 's absence has played elsewhere Coming in to take that one Riley once more Many many frees now in this match, a total of thirty-one so far And we 're just inside two minutes to go to half-time Conor Deegan Coyle Nice controlled play by the Down men Burns, belting it forward Comes off the chest of Kevin Foley Greg Blaney going forward with purpose McCartan has a player outside him if he wants to give it to him that is Ross Carr And the referee has whistled And it 's a free to Down Ross Carr lobbed the ball Hit it in But in any case it 's going to be a free Sean Boylan and uh Colm O'Rourke I wonder when they 'll decide to introduce Colm Ross Carr, trying to put four points between the teams He 's done precisely that with his third point of the afternoon Down leading by double scores And the bookmakers all around the country who made them rank outsiders, must be uh having the odd little touch of panic at this stage Well Bart Simpson is here in any case Good kick out by Mickey McQuillian towards Gerry McEntee, having a very fine match indeed Of course P J Gillic who started once again at right corner forward Liam Hayes prods it inside towards Bernard Flynn David Beggy calling for it on his left-hand side but Flynn has the confidence and composure to kick himself go for the first point of the second half and cut back the deficit now to just three points That 's two points now for Bernard Flynn First time back out into the middle Martin O'Connell, down to Greg Blaney, Down motoring well Barry Breen now, a quick look up on the left boot Coming down from the clouds towards Peter Withnell and Mickey Linden Linden gets there first There 's plenty of support play Ross Carr there Barry Breen there as well And James McCartan Little chip shot by McCartan And it 's up and it 's over the bar His second point of the day And he 's proving a real handful for anybody who 's set to mark him so far I think he scored two points in last year 's League Final as well And then it was Kevin Foley who had the task of subduing him on that occasion\n<$C> Yeah we were saying earlier on in the first half how influential Greg Blaney can be but he won that ball in midfield and brought it forward uh Here we see James McCartan getting the ball, taking on the Meath defence and I 've seen it all Ger when I 've seen James McCartan kicking the point with his left foot\n<$B>  Now to John Kelly Down keeping their balance and composure in defence and a good man-to-man mark up All this while Peter Withnell is down injured James McCartan, again coming across over this right-hand side Ross Carr Carr kicking with the left And it 's gone in That 's a silver point by Ross Carr Never bent, either right or left Was absolutely dead straight And how about that A five-point difference Taking the free to James McCartan An exciting player in full flight Flynn tried to go back and put in a challenge It 's with Mickey Linden Linden yet to score in this game Now 's his chance And he 's put it over, There 's a big sign, outside a pub which is owned by Mickey Linden 's mother and aunties which says, Mickey bring back the Sam McGuire They 're doing the business so far And Colm O'Rourke is coming in as we watch the reprise", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL",

{"text": "<Boxing matches>\n\n\n<$A> There 's a comeback from Barrett Barrett loops back with a good, left hand to the chin, Well this is a remarkable contest Just as you think one fella 's getting on top the other comes back In the opening round I thought for a while that Walsh was going to win inside the distance but he 's after running into a couple of hard ones here from Barrett, And Barrett the sort of fella that just won't give up He took Walsh 's best punches in the opening round And here he is still with fight Referee calling for quiet in the corner, Barrett, putting all his hopes in landing that big left hand He seems to get an awful lot of power into a looping left hand He can punch with either of course, but the left hand and there he runs into trouble He 's caught Caught by Billy Walsh But he 'll still come forward, Well you don't often see such action in, this the second round What a contest, Neither 's going to give any quarter in this bout, And indeed Cork, doing very well, in these senior championships Four boxers in the finals One of them must lose here, And there 's that big, left hand again That dangerous left hand of Barrett 's comes out of the blue but he 's not able to set his man up to catch him for a second time, Tries once more, They 're hacking away for all they 're worth Flings in through the canvas He looks weary He looks tired Walsh  And there 's the bell for the end of the round And a tired Billy Walsh back to the corner, And what a sensational bout of punishment this one There 's that left hand and the right one and once again that left hand He gets a lot into that left hand Sean Barrett, Well it 's quite a punch-up this one,  Well there 's three minutes left, and if it 's anything like the last two minutes there 's going to be plenty of action here Will it go the full three minutes Because there 's been an awful lot of hard punching all the way through here Billy Walsh in red, in this all-Cork final, for the Irish title This is, the light welterweight final Walsh and Sean Barrett from Rylane in Cork And how they 're going to separate them it 's difficult to know Barrett was warned in the first round and that will, go against him quite severely on points, But just, as you think one fellow is getting on top the other comes back For a while it looked as if Billy Walsh was going to win this inside the distance But how Barrett did and I don't know but he came right back, and has scored with some good punches every so often particularly with that left hand He 's a wild looking left hand but when it hones in, to his opponent 's chin, it can do an enormous amount of damage, Inter-county minor footballer, cross-country champion he 's a real all-rounder, this man in blue Sean Barrett, against Billy Walsh, one of the most popular boxers in the stadium Well most only know him for the last year or so, but he certainly draws the crowds Very popular Hooks with the left hand Wow who got the better of that It 's difficult to know, because such, fine punches scored very freely Big right hand Walsh again thrashes the right hand  uh sinks a couple into the body But instead of cracking, Barrett comes back again with some of his own ammunition Jabs the body and up to the head, They 've almost punched themselves out, Well they haven't let up for a second, all the way through this contest And the crowds well they 've enjoyed every moment of it And there 's that big right hand, And Walsh beginning to get to him now in this last round But never write this fellow Barrett off And there once again he fires back, Well he seemed to use the elbow there on the, blind side of the referee Referee <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>, careful of the clash of heads They hardly know what they 're doing at this stage They 're out on their feet at the final bell A big embrace the best of friends but what a punishing contest,  Well you it don't see much better than that Action all the way through, Well there again, the big attack the big punchers, and at times difficult to know who gets the better of that exchange , Yes a great ovation for these two boxers\n\n\n\n<$A> And that 's Neil Sinclair coming out for the first round Neil Sinclair in blue Very promising young boxer Only nineteen His opponent, the more experienced Neil Gough, from Saint Paul 's in Waterford as you see there Neil Gough is the reigning champion Won this title, as welterweight last year when he beat Eddie Fisher in the final Was quite a scalp to get, but Eddie Fisher was beaten this time by this youngster Neil Sinclair Now Sinclair is a very promising young boxer from the Holy Family Club in Belfast, Sinclair, won a bronze, in the World Junior Championships, a couple of years ago in Montreal, Gough, more than likely need to call on all his experience here to handle this young fellow cos he 's a very smart boxer, tall punches well, looked very good beating Tommy Lawler, catching him as he came in He 's going to try and draw, Neil Gough Catch him as he comes in I should think but Gough is a wise boxer Twenty-two Been around a while Reigning champion He 's not going to give up his title easily That 's Neil Gough in red, Half-way through the first round and still nothing to really separate them as yet, Sinclair try and keep this at long range I should think, using the centre of the ring, jabbing away with a long left hand He 's trying to draw his man out with that short right hand Gough, again makes the mistake of coming in and running into that left hand flush on the face Gough hasn't really worked out exactly what to do here to get past those punches Yes so a little bit better this time, Sinclair gets a lot of leverage into those punches, punches from way out, and when they land, they 're fairly explosive, Gough again trying to find a range Getting inside but he 's not able to, stay in there and punch away, Sinclair now begin to step up the pace a little bit in this round, Well there 's an awful lot,  not an awful lot between them But if he 's to hold on to his title well he 's got to really work out, a good approach  Coming up to the second round in this contest here Here 's the challenger for it Neil Sinclair A very promising young boxer, who has won a bronze medal, in the World Juniors And there 's the champion, Neil Gough Neil Gough from Waterford, from Saint Paul 's club in Waterford So it 's Waterford Belfast here Neil Sinclair, from Glengormley, and a member of the Holy Family Boxing Club in Belfast, and the opening round fairly tame Sinclair has been more or less dictating the style of contest here Uses the ring quite well Gough, hasn't been able to upset, his cool style of boxing Gough the champion, and the more experienced of the two Well Sinclair has a lot of experience himself, although he 's only nineteen He boxed in underage, international boxing, quite a number of occasions, including that bronze medal he won in Montreal, a couple of years ago That was for the World Juniors, Gough himself has been, through the underage, the Intermediate Champion All-Ireland Champion in Youth, boxing a few times, and of course Irish Senior Boxing He was voted uhm, Champion of the Year, two years ago and he won an Irish title in the same year, Now Gough, is finding it difficult to take control of this contest He 's got to really, put on his thinking cap, do something get in close to this fella That 's more like it He gets in with a short punch Sinclair, has been setting a nice cool pace here, and staying out of trouble And this is where Gough has got to score He 's got to score when he 's in close like that, and keep up pressure When he gets a move like that he 's got to keep moving forward Stay in close At long range, Sinclair, looks the more comfortable, but he 's got to score the points too And there 's a scoring one, He wants to wipe his face there There 's some blood about his nose or there 's, yes it 's nothing serious Referee takes a closer look and off we go, That 's a good solid left hand in the face flush in the face That was a good solid one there from, Sinclair, And this one fellow Sinclair is showing his boxing skills and showing them well in the second round , The end of that second round and I think he should be comparatively happy Needs to step up the pace a little bit more with one round to go,  And there we see the kind of, thing that 's scoring the points for this fellow His left hand is the best punch he 's got Neil Sinclair And he 's scoring well with the left hand Scoring the points against the champion, All the time pressure from, Neil Gough coming forward and again he runs right on to a left But it 's his only way to hold on to his title is to get close, Well there 's a lot of work to do here The champion Neil Gough Third and final round, And Neil Gough, last year 's champion up against one of the most promising amateurs in Ireland right now And Neil Sinclair, from Belfast, boxing coolly, calmly, never flustered And Gough has been finding it difficult to get beyond, the long reach of Sinclair And in this last round, he still has the chance of holding onto his title There can't be too much, between them And there 's a good looping left and right hand there from Gough Gough scores well, early on on this last round Gough is a great one for winning the last round for coming from behind He 's done it before, on many an occasion And he 's not going to give up easily, And this 's been quite a good interesting contest all the way through And a cracking right hand from Sinclair, Yes we 're seeing some good boxing in this bout These are two good boxers Well there 's no doubt about it we 'll have a good international representative at welterweight Well as either of these fellas 'd hold their own with anyone And this, is it going to be the youngster taking over the title Neil Sinclair, scoring freely with a couple of good punches there, Yes, that could upset his bleeding It doesn't seem to be worrying him too much Indicates he 's alright And in this final round, took a while to warm up but when it did, this has developed into quite an interesting and quite a good entertaining contest And good boxing Each try to outwit the other Gough at times, a little frustrated that he can't get beyond this youngster 's long punches Oh and a cracking right hand from Gough That was one of his best punches A really good right hand And quick to retaliate was Neil Sinclair That was a lovely move, from Neil Gough Now can he do that again That 's what he 's been trying to do but he 's, got to do it more often Try to get slightly off this time And Gough staying the pace staying the pace very well , And the bell for the end Looks as if he 's a little disappointed it didn't go on for another half minute or so because he 'd been beginning to put his punches together very well", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "4e3e27a1-1cd5-4e00-9689-41d2d66ae61f", "added":

{"text": "<Hurling 1>\n\n\n<$A> Kelly winning the duel there against, George O'Connor Advancing, by ten metres Good solo run Looking for the last shot now half stopped by Sean Flood Good call by Ted Morrison the goal keeper who came and gathered, towards Dermot Prendergast 's wing over there with Hubert Rigney Liam Dunne again He 's having a marvellous match Sean Wickham, bidding to keep that ball in play Did so successfully Now Michael Duignan exerting more and more of an influence, on the contest round the centre of the field That 's Johnny Pilkington let inside there It 's a brilliant goal, Daithi Regan, got the final touch, after Pilkington delivered the pass inside A lovely piece of wrist action And Offaly get the opening goal of the match Well that 's the kind of goal that Jimmy Barry Murphy was scoring not too long ago I remember one particular match an All Ireland Semi-Final something similar happened Martin Storey on his left-hand side A cross intended for Gary Prendergast Instead it reaches Roy Mannion again, tapping it neatly outside Johnny Pilkington brilliantly knocked down, by Billy Byrne Runs on to Eamon Sinnott Trying to link up unsuccessfully Links up with Jimmy Houlihan Outside towards Martin Storey It 's just tailing in, a nice point, a measured build-up For a moment there I thought they were going to take a little bit too, long with the build-up, but in the end Storey pointed brilliantly\n<$B> That was an excellent point Ger and uh, it 's one that Wexford needed badly to keep in touch I think They 've got all the game in the middle of the field and uh, they 're all trying Jimmy Houlihan 's moving forward out the field now and try and get more of the play\n<$A> And there 's Storey then with that neat point, good distance out And indeed you 'll have noted there in that replay that Houlihan  picked up an injury Johnny, one of the great campaigners, denied space over there, but recovers well Already picked up two All Ireland medals in eighty-one and eighty-five and runs on neatly to Michael Duignan And it 's over the bar That 's a second point of the match for the St Rynagh 's player Sean Wickham picking it up here, Oops, doesn't get another chance Roy Mannion really sticking to his <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Leech Across it goes to Martin Storey And Jim Troy is happy and content to see that one go up his stick and up and over the crossbar Martin Storey, takes the credit his second point of the game Niall McDonald Sean Flood having some work to do to get under that one In the end it, falls favourably for Johnny Pilkington Danny Owen 's got a lovely pickup, about thirty metres out Hooks splendidly Over there by Billy Byrne recovers, looking for a bit of support, finding it from Michael Duignan And that 's the first point to Offaly of the second half, Duignan with his third score of the game,\nBilly Byrne trying to gather, runs on to Dermot Prendergast, trying to go by the challenge of Hubert Rigney Just struck a little bit of freedom in there, and passed inside George O'Connor maintained the hand passing movement outside to Martin Storey Now he can he complete the movement It 's gone over the bar There were about three hand passes up right across the face of the goal, before it eventually reached uh, Martin Storey, and he got the third point\n<$B> It 's a traditional  Wexford score a lot of hand passes as I say Ger out to Martin Storey And he 's been quite impressive when he 's got a chances and again took an excellent score there\n<$A> So each side then having made one change in the, forward lines from their starting formations That 's Brian Whelehan half blocked down by Tom Dempsey Martin Storey, having got three points in the match so far Ball was touched on the ground, and Willy Horgan nipping in quickly In fact he 's going to throw the ball in A disappointed Mark Corrigan looks on And while all that 's happening it 's gone over the bar And it 's John Conran who 's put it over the bar The sub who came on has got his first point George O'Connor again trying to, pick this ball up Johnny Dooley working beaverishly hard in the centre Joaquim Kelly likewise, trying to go by Sean Flood Tapped forward by Brian Whelehan seemed to have picked up an injuries with, playing that ball forward initially And the man lying down, needing attention is Joaquim Kelly, We mentioned clean catches just a moment ago Our  statistics show that uh Wexford lead in the clean catching department by thirteen four That 's in all sectors of the field So a free then, which Johnny Dooley is preparing to take Stopped by Ted Morrissey It 's gone in The second goal for Daithi Regan He scored the first after twenty minutes This latest one has come, eighteen minutes into the second half,\n<$A> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>, needing a bit of support still lines being closed down repeatedly and, it 's finally <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Kerry gets away only as far as the other midfielder for Clare James Shanahan shuffled outside to Tommy Guilfoyle From a tricky angle Tommy restores Clare 's advantage That 's three points now for, Tommy Guilfoyle in this match, points set up by the two midfielders In it goes, and, pursuing it in there was Pat Heffernan Good clearance under pressure by John Russell Only out as far as Garry Kirby Snappy little shot by Garry Kirby, over the crossbar Five points his contribution Limerick in front, Declan Nash, towards Terence Kenny, with an exaggerated leap and in the end he failed to hold on to it, but there 's a gap Garry Kirby 's there and he 's drilled it over the crossbar And it 's Limerick now with a two-point lead Kirby 's got the last couple of scores,\n<$B> Oh he 's very very accurate Ger and give him half a chance anywhere, inside a goal he doesn't miss too many chances A lot of the Clare  half backs might clear the ball but they 're leaving the half forwards very very loose with the result that Limerick have now stretched into a three point lead They have a strong breeze behind them they 're looking good\n<$A> Half cut out, followed up by Mike Galligan Well this is a critical time in the match for Clare, likewise for Limerick, because they 've begun to assert themselves And they 've really dominated the exchanges now in the last ten minutes, Galligan with his fifth point of the game Ciaran Cary, to take that one well out of the danger area A pass up towards Pat Heffernan, against Anthony Daly Across, brilliantly taken by Galligan Oh that 's a hard won point This is much more like it now from Limerick, a pale shadow of their real selves in the first half Accredit that to Clare Ciaran Cary, racing forward looking for his first point of the second half, hooked splendidly by John Chaplin recovers however He 's got support from Gary Kirby Well that 's a star-studded performance by Gary Kirby in the second half He 's contributed nine points in all Mike Guilfoyle, running through the centre, to Duffy Hitting it low and Tommy <unclear> several sylls </unclear> And it 's a goal, a goal by Duffy It 's come, with eight and a half minutes to go Well what a late finish we 're going to have now to this one\n<$B> It 's a very good goal by Michael Duffy, Just gathers it here on to his right hand Hits a low  hard shot Always difficult for a goal keeper, the hard ground I think Joe O'Connor puts the Tommy Quaid off there and it bounds into the net And, it 's going to be a very close finish now I think\n<$A> Clare with perhaps another chance, got out on this occasion by Mike <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear>, who 's, had a storming game in the middle of the field   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$B>  Clare player was unlucky there  \n<$B> He just fell over more than anything else but he definitely appealed it And it 's probably, a bit harsh But uh, Limerick a vital free for Limerick at this stage they were just hanging on And it 's anybody 's game if they get this one, just the breathing space they need\n<$A> A minute remaining Gary Kirby, who 's contributed nine points in all in this match, wind supported, <unclear> several sylls </unclear> That 's point number ten for Gary Kirby, who really has been the star of the show from Limerick 's point of view Mike Guilfoyle blocked down brilliantly by Ger Hegarty He 's given them a steely resolve in mid-field since coming in That was a master substitution,\n<$B> They they know it well <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> and like now if they were going to have him in midfield Ger and I thought this, maybe this was something Clare could have tried He was getting very little of the ball into him and uh  Clare they were lucky to get another score but the ball simply didn't come to them I thought they might have thought of that a bit earlier\n<$A> Duffy, the goal scorer across the face of the goal once again, drops down here, Hit in uh Tommy Quaid Sees that one go over from Cyril Lyons A point, they were looking for the goal,\n<$A> In towards P J Cuddy it runs on however towards John Fitzpatrick who had such a good game against Wexford last year Ted Morrissey Martin Storey losing the helm at that time and there 's a foul, by George O'Connor on uh Niall Rigby That 's going to be some battle in the middle of the field two big strong men\n<$B> Yes indeed and uh in the League Final George O'Connor played with an injury I think in fairness And he wasn't seen at his best but, it should be good clash there today Two very big strong men, and uh both very important players for their teams,\n<$A> Rigney the free taker Still no score on the boards In towards PJ Cuddy Seem to be held by Ger Cushe The ball has trickled on and it 's gone in An amazing goal That is an amazing score Only two minutes gone, and Laois, have gone in front\n<$B> It 's an extraordinary goal As the ball lands in the square, it 's a high dropping free right in on top of the square And P J Cuddy certainly seemed to be held by the full back Gerald Cushe And as luck would have it it bounced, in towards Ted Morrissey You see just being held there by Phil Dockery, Ted Morrissey advanced to meet him Ran off his hurley, and just rolled over the line And the umpire was on the spot, quick as a flash to give a goal\n<$A> Mickey Sullivan challenging against George O'Connor Georgie making the interception Andy Dunne has missed it It 's run on to John O'Connor Normally we 'd expect to see him at half back To Eamon Sinnott Oh good vision by Sinnott, spotting that Martin Storey was unmarked And they 're transferring it into a score now Not on this occasion That 's Cyril Duggan making the, intervention Storey again He 's starting so impressively, great athleticism, good drive and dash On to Jimmy Houlihan And it 's a goal The old one two out of Storey and Houlihan, rewarded with a fine goal, after eight minutes", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "20fc9403-af54-4a85-a71c-f3a8012167ed",

{"text": "<Rugby match>\n\n\n<$A> Welcome to Lansdowne Road Thank-you Ger uh we are looking down at a Lansdowne Road which has been fairly drenched in the last twelve hours but at the moment, mercifully the rain has ceased the ground may have the chance to dry out It 'll be very difficult I should imagine for the players because the wind which was blowing quite strongly is still there It may not be quite as bad But spectators have come from all over for this and the England supporters in huge numbers anticipating as you said that they would be winning their sixteenth Triple Crown today The series goes going back to eighteen seventy-five, this the one hundred and fourth in the series, England having won fifty-nine games, Ireland thirty-six, and the draws there have been eight The last one here in nineteen sixty-eight when Ireland and England drew nine all The band waiting for the arrival on the field of the England side led by their captain Will Carling, and the Ireland side led by their captain Rob Saunders Very testing and nervy moment and the teams coming out, England in their tracksuits and led by their captain Will Carling, and Simon Hodgkinson coming out there, the man who has kicked so far thirty-eight points in the two matches played Going for the all-time record in the championship of fifty-four points A very strong side and the England subs, coming out at the end of the party Michael Skinner the last one out And now Lansdowne Road prepares to welcome this new-look exciting Irish side, scorer of four  fine tries in Cardiff and hoping that they will be able to get some reasonable possession today against this very strong English pack and maybe we 'll see some more exciting action from the Irish backs So the England team and replacements on the field as the band strikes up to welcome the Irish captain led by their captain Rob Saunders,  There 's Fitzgerald <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Gordon Hamilton and Keith Crossan in his thirty-fifth international becoming Ireland 's most capped winger Brian Robinson, Jim Staples, last onto the pitch As the teams will line up and shortly they will be presented to the President of Ireland, and, as the Irish team just loosen up there the English team in their tracksuits and probably very wisely in their tracksuits, keeping out the rather cold wind, Uh with me Tony Ward A very nervy moment but uh undoubtedly England starting this game as favourites but Ireland certainly not without a chance\n<$B> Yes I would agree In fact it 's ironic uh we were saying earlier about the weather uh the fact that it 's changing, it 's got very very wet but normally that would favour Ireland But the England style of play where they rely very much on the rolling maul, obviously it 's literally going to suit them down to the ground Having said that the weather and the slippery ball will also help us to <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> them and that 's something we 're going to need to do from the start So it 's a great occasion and uh I certainly know that we 're going to see a very spirited uh display from Ireland\n<$A> Now Her Excellency, President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, has gone to Lansdowne Road and <unclear> several words </unclear> she 's wearing the green of Ireland as the presidential salute is played, Will Carling the England captain presented to Her Excellency and the rest of the England team Jeremy Guscott there, Simon Hodgkinson, Rob Andrew, and some of the <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Dean Richards and Peter Winterbottom all there Mike Teague played so well with the Lions <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> keeper And and that was the reserves The referee this afternoon Alain Cecillon from France with two French touch judges And Rob Andrew Pat Saunders introduces his players to, Not too sure Tony whether it was a good idea for the Irish players to come out without their tracksuits Tony\n<$B> Yeah I reckon it 'll be very cold uh down there Certainly that 's a good idea by the English on their part, to come out wearing them because this five minutes uh normally it 's a very nervy time but particularly when it 's as cold as it is out there at the moment it certainly doesn't help\n<$A> Ireland making two changes following their impressive display against Wales with Keith Crossan recalled to the left wing to win his thirty-fifth cap, thus becoming Ireland 's most capped winner In the forwards, a towering Neil Francis at number five returns after a year out of the team in a bid to counter England 's lineout specialists and captaining the side again is scrum half Rob Saunders in his third international, determined that Ireland will produce some of the same play that they showed in Cardiff with more discipline and fewer errors, And England following their comfortable wins over Wales and uh Scotland field an unchanged side in their bid to win the Triple Crown for the sixteenth time The remarkable Simon Hodgkinson again at fullback having kicked a record seven penalties against Wales and a further seventeen points against Scotland They 've given few opportunities to run to their backs, halfbacks Hill and Andrew have used the possession to peg back the opposition The strength of the England side of course very much up front with the tall Wade Dooley six foot eight and Paul Ackford six foot six Obvious dangers in the lineout But with five in the side on the wrong side of thirty Maybe this would be their last chance of glory in the championship, \n<$A> So Lansdowne Road giving a fine rendition of <&Irish> Amhra/n na bhFiann </&Irish> and  earlier it 's given quite uh an enthusiastic rendition of the new song for Ireland to the air of Danny Boy The Ireland team now to play with the benefit of this wind in the first half There is quite a wind blowing downfield from this end as we look at the very fine pitch at Lansdowne Road But it has absorbed a lot of water Tony and uh it 'll be interesting to see what effect it 'll have on the players\n<$B> I think it it  certainly will get cut up very very quickly and it will be <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> to see if the two games to date there 's a very good <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> I 'll be very surprised if they do certainly in the first half of this game I think they 'll seek to try and wear Ireland down, they 'll seek to use the rolling maul So obviously for our part we are going to put it wide and the underfoot the conditions are certainly not going to help us\n<$A> So Ireland having won the toss in this Digital International at Lansdowne Road Referee Alain Cecillon from France prepares to watch Rob Andrew start this international and the only thing they need now is a football, Packed Lansdowne Road, tickets at a premium There really wasn't a chance of a ticket A huge crowd has come over from England hoping to see this \nEngland side score their first Triple Crown victory since nineteen eighty They 've already beaten Scotland, they 've already beaten Wales Can they beat England Can they beat Ireland Rob Andrew then starts this one hundred and fourth international Philip Matthews in possession on his own twenty-two, driven back by the England pack but Ireland control it well Rob Saunders waits, takes the responsibility himself A lineout fifteen metres inside the Irish half Fine young player is Saunders just twenty-two years of age, third international, born in Nottingham of Scottish parents And England are the first to vary the lineout Matthews stands back, Francis goes in, Matthews takes <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> for Ireland, Saunders kicks into the twenty-two Hodgkinson challenged by Simon Geoghegan England twenty-two\n<$B> It 's a great start by Ireland and again twice Philip Matthews was involved From the kickoff he set up a good ball for the clearance initially and there again set up a lovely tuck to give Rob Saunders the time to <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> down the uh the side of the field Good kicking by Rob Saunders\n<$A> Steve Smith to throw Up towards the front of the lineout, Neil Francis standing at two Four is Rigney England win it though Back to Hill, to Andrew but the England backs have moved forward Andrew did well When Andrew went to pass there as he was challenged by the Irish back row Will Carling was ahead of him so he had to go for the clearance by the kick Back of the line for Ireland is Gordon Hamilton, number seven Brian Robinson just in front of him, Smith 's throw Penalty against Ireland in the lineout as there was won by Dean Richards Ireland trying to barge through to prevent the England jumpers Rob Andrew from inside the England half finds a good touch inside the Ireland twenty-two He got a last yard out of that Well I 've said it many times before <unclear> 10 sylls </unclear> He plays such a simple and unselfish game He 's a smashing outside man, Smith 's throw <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the England side Whistle goes Referee gives the scrum and awards the put-in to England Certainly the two England second rowers liable to cause Ireland some problems in the lineout Now what about the scrums Rob Andrew I think in back, in a drop kicking position, just out of picture, lying very deep as indeed are all the England backs Hill puts in for England, dummy run Richards carries at his feet Big drive by the England pack into the Irish twenty-two Scrum turns, comes back and it 's a penalty against Ireland in the scrum And whether that was for deliberately wheeling it, or for offside I 'm not too sure but the French referee had no hesitation as the English forwards put on the pressure in that scrummage\n<$B> And I think it may have been for offside in the end against possibly Gordon Hamilton but uh I certainly hope that 's not ominous because that didn't look good at all There 's no doubt,  it 's not specifically the change of Francis for Galway but the mere fact that we 've changed the pack we 've had for the last two games it naturally it 's going to be uh it 's going to take a little while for this eight to settle down", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Clinton departure>\n\n\n<$A> Well there is uhm some uh hope that he 's going to arrive very shortly At the moment as you can see the security presence is there on the roof of the terminal buildings and we there are no there 's a very strong police presence and military presence here this morning Uhm as the camera pans around there you 're shortly going to see that there is a huddle of people down at the uh  the foot of the steps of Air Force One, but they haven't yet formed into any kind of a receiving line or anything like that, which I 'm sure they would have done if they were about to, if the presidential party were in fact about to arrive We have a few more details now about the family that he is likely to meet It is in fact the Filipovic family, uhm from Bosnia who originally were from Sarajevo, and what makes this family particularly relevant is that the little girl who was a member of the family, Zlata, wrote a book which you may recall being published called Zlata 's Diary, which wrote about her times as a child growing up in war-torn Sarajevo So she will, she and her family will be the family who will greet uhm the president when he actually arrives, and with them will be a friend of Zlata 's called Mirna Pedalo who also uh comes from Sarajevo and is a close friend of Zlata 's So that 's uhm a little bit more detail that might not have been uh, you might not have been aware of so far,\n\n<$A> Precisely I mean that 's the point that Foreign Affairs are making here They say that this is yet another way of linking the visit if you like You may also remember that uh you know throughout his visit to Dublin yesterday he made numerous references to Ireland 's role as a peace-keeper, as a peace-maker in the world even though we were such a small nation And I think that   particularly now that the Americans are so keen to enhance their peace-keeping role with this assignment of troops to Bosnia, I think this may be another uh, quite a small link, but a but a link nonetheless in a chain of of of a a peace-keeping momentum that he would be keen to build from this visit,\n\n<$A> Precisely Now if I can cut away from that theme for the moment Brian, you may see from the television pictures that the crew appear to be heading for the plane now Uhm  they obviously would be preparing their flight plan for going to the US base, army base at Ramstein just outside Frankfurt and uh so, presumably now that means that we must be coming quite close to a time when the presidential party are going to arrive A very small detail but this might be of relevance, uhm you may , you may recall yesterday there was miles and miles of red carpet out on the tarmac I think it was something like three hundred feet of red carpet were laid for the uh receiving line and for the ceremonials that were here yesterday A very very short piece of carpet there at the foot of the steps into Air Force One And I think that that is because there is going to be a very very brief ceremony There was there aren't going to be any long walks, there aren't going to be any long uh receiving lines It 'll all be handled in a very very quick way to get him on his way as speedily as possible, Well yes I mean Brian I think that 's the key difference between the the visits that we saw of President Reagan and uhm I I I only barely recall the the the the the Kennedy visit But the key difference is that I mean there was serious business on the table this time There was serious peace initiative to be sorted out, there were, uh uh uh I we all know how serious the logjam was until Tuesday It remains to be seen how far we will go beyond that But there 's no doubt but that he came here not just for ceremonials, not just the walkabouts but to create a real moral imperative, to move the process on, and that you know the business doesn't end here, the business is moving on to uh Bosnia, to Germany and to Bosnia now which will be significant Now if I can bring you back to the pictures if you, you may have seen there there were cars arriving, a motorcade coming in through the, the the tarmac behind Air Force One So that 's just gone behind the terminal building now where the the the B pier, where we all get our usual flights out of Dublin Airport So I 'm sure they will come round from behind that very shortly, Yes I mean I think the rain is not quite as heavy as it was Uhm uh, I certainly picked the wrong moment to be out in it, but uhm you can see there that there is now much more activity around the foot of the plane and uh having seen some cars on their way at the back of the tarmac as I said a moment ago, I 'm sure that we are going to see some action very very shortly,\n\n<$A> They they may well have done that uh I think a number of people I met last night were feeling very sorry for President Robinson who seemed to be in quite light clothing, so I 'd say it 's just as well she wasn't here this morning You see there some of the security presence I assume, uh all looking very concerned to make sure that everything goes as well as possible Just on a slightly different note Brian uhm one thing that struck me uh last night I was out with some friends and a number of, a everybody talks about how they remember where they were when President Kennedy was here Nobody ever refers to Jackie Kennedy and to her role in the visit, and yet everybody last night was talking about what a strong presence Hillary Clinton had had, I would have thought That 's Christy Spring <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Dick Spring And that must be Proinsias Thanks Brian Yes the dignitaries are just coming onto the tarmac now, uh you see there Dick Spring, Christy Spring his wife, and  a short time ago we saw John Bruton being escorted by two uh army officers onto the tarmac, he 's just behind them, there 's Proinsias de Rossa and his wife Monica So clearly uh the arrival must be imminent Everybody   warmed up  , warmly wrapped up, sorry, for for this morning against the elements,\n\n<$A> Uh he may well be, he may also be looking at a few helicopters that were around here a short time ago Uhm  there there you see the Taoiseach and his wife Finola Bruton being escorted to the receiving point and I understand that that means that the arrival should be fairly imminent,\n\n<$A> Indeed, Precisely, that 's uh Brigadier General Bill Dwyer, General Officer Eastern Command, and uh the Chief of Staff is Lieutenant General McMahon, And Brian I understand that the motorcade has just been cleared for arrival So I would imagine that that crowd of people will start forming into a fairly orderly line uh pretty soon now, Yes you can see people trying to shepherd them into position now, Uh I have no indication as to where they are, uhm we 're still trying to find out exactly where they are going to be, but uhm as you see there 's quite a disorderly crowd there which could which could be anybody really Uhm there 's some  some attempt to put some security uh presence on  or to put it into order But uhm we 'll just have to wait and see what happens I mean I understand that this Bosnian element was added pretty much as,  at the last minute So uh we 'll just have to wait and see how that pans out Sorry  not to be able to give you any further details on that, No it certainly seems to have cleared up I think there may be some slight drizzle out there but nothing you couldn't live with Uhm I think it would have been a shame if that torrential rain had continued and had marred the departure, because  as your panellists and yourself have been saying, it really has been an extraordinarily successful visit and I think that while there  there aren't the crowds here at the airport that we saw before, there aren't the crowds we saw in College Green This is a low-key departure But it 's an important element, it 's a send-off, it 's the final moment of, of the trip, and it would be a shame to see even that marred by bad weather, Yes but as you said earlier I mean, the uh what makes this business , this uh trip different is that there is a huge business element to it, and I think, given the pressing business that the Minister, that the President faces in uh Germany in relation to the Bosnian troops and the peace-keeping mission there, I 'm sure that if there is any slight breach of protocol involved that everybody will be prepared to overlook that and to live with it I mean these things run a little bit late, we just have to live with that sort of thing, Well you see there the red carpet line-up has is starting Brian So I mean that clearly is an indication that uh the arrival is imminent, Yes well I mean, I think uh most of us who have been to Dublin Airport are familiar with the with the rolling green fields that surround it Uhm, it really is a a a a quite a  brightening up into quite a nice morning, surprisingly for anyone who has  who has been here since since earlier,\n\n<$A> No we have no update, but as you say, I mean everybody 's just standing by, I I  I think given that uh these things can run a little bit late I mean there may have been a delay at at the Ambassador 's residence where he was overnighting in saying good bye to the Ambassador uh These these things can take a little while longer and,\n\n<$A> Yes that 's  that 's indeed true, but just to bring you up to date uh, they have actually now stopped all other flights coming in or going out of Dublin Airport, so that is a clear indicator that the arrival is imminent and we are just standing by We can actually see there are some motorcycle riders on the tarmac but I don't think that they 're associated with the actual presidential motorcade, I think they may have been associated with uhm the earlier arrival of some of the dignitaries And overhead you can see some helicopters, probably a security presence there for the uh for the departure I mean, uh  I think uh it 's hard to overstate how worried the entourage surrounding the President are about the security issue I mean it is such a huge worry for them, that even in what,  in circumstances that you and I would sort of take for granted, they are paranoid about it Uh uh maybe that 's the wrong word to use given that they have had horrible instances in the past where presidents have been assassinated in America But they are so conscious of every every every final detail that uh you can understand why there 's, you know everything tenses up when the President is about to arrive, and not just uh out of anticipation,\n\n<$A> Absolutely Brian if I can just uh bring you up to date We 're going to go over to Paul Hick now in uhm in Air Traffic Control Paul what 's the latest\n<$B> Uh Ingrid uh we 've done the security sweep of the taxiway and runway and we 're awaiting the startup of Air Force One I believe the motorcade has just reached the airport so they 're obviously a bit behind schedule\n<$A> So do you have an estimated time of departure now\n<$B> Well it depends uh it takes them to say goodbye really on the apron Uhm I would say taxi would probably be inside ten minutes\n<$A> Inside ten minutes\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> That 's great Paul Thanks very much indeed for for giving us that So as you can see, people are still assembled at the bottom of the plane and waiting for the motorcade, but as Paul was saying, the motorcade has reached the airport, that all incoming and outgoing flights have been stopped, and we 're just waiting for the next step which is the arrival of the actual presidential party, Not that far actually uh uh I I 'm sure anyone who 's been to Dublin Airport will be aware of that circular pier where all of the flights the B twenty-one to B twenty-eight gates are It 's not parked into one of those tunnel things that you go in and out of to get on and off the planes It 's parked on the apron I 'd say about two hundred  two hundred yards away from that Possibly, possibly closer But what is interesting is that here at the airport, oh sorry, here he , here he comes We can see the motorcade arriving, first a Garda car and then the  the the motorcycle outriders, another Garda car, presumably Special Branch, and here comes the presidential car, And they 're taking a circular route around the plane, round the back of the plane and coming round to the front where they will be greeted by the reception committee, It 's amazing how many cars are actually in the cavalcade because uh you kind of wonder who 's in them all, And as the President just about arrives in front of the plane they 're still coming from behind, an awful lot of American limousines, Oh yes I 'm sure it is It 's just uh I suppose we in Ireland are not used to this level of uhm administration or of protocol if you like, so it 's quite impressive to see it when when you do And the car has stopped at the foot of the  steps to the plane Security men as usual watching for anything in the crowd that could go wrong before they will let the presidential party out of the car, And, and, and there is President Clinton in the car preparing to  disembark, Looking fresh after a late night in Dublin Castle last night, Absolutely, uhm but then he 's on to very subdued business I suppose that could explain it Saying good bye to Finola Bruton there, Hillary Clinton giving Finola Bruton a kiss, so obviously they must have got on very well Looking very crisp in a, what looks like a dark brown jacket trimmed in white with gold buttons", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Clinton arrival>\n\n\n<$A> There is an extraordinary sense, you 're looking there at the rolling fields of north County Dublin, of occasion and history this morning Brian Just a few moments ago the army number one band was rehearsing <&Irish> Amhra/n na bhFiann </&Irish> making sure everything was right The President Mary Robinson has arrived She was just rehearsing walking up to the steps, flanked by the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, Lieutenant General Gerry McMahon, and the GOC of the Eastern Command, Brigadier General Bill Dwyer Also the escort of honour, the motorcycle escort which is also drawn from Cathal Brugha Barracks That normally escorts President Mary Robinson This morning that will escort President Bill Clinton to the A/ras You can also perhaps see at the moment the line-up there of the Second Field Artillery Regiment, also you can see the motorcycle escort there A few moments ago, and you may see again, there 's a large crowd of the public have been allowed in They 're on the main roof of the departure lounge They were frisked but they were allowed through because they waited apparently for hours to get in here this morning We 've just been told by air traffic control that in fact he 's gained some time There you can see the people who 've come to watch the President here this morning, I think it 's as though they don't care how long they have to wait They just know it 's an historic occasion which they will remember in ten twenty thirty years Uhm it 's almost in stark contrast to the atmosphere yesterday at Aldergrove This is a real sense of occasion <.> I </> it 's as though the entire Irish nation has come out here this morning to say welcome to President Clinton and his First Lady, There 's, I think we, I 'm going to go straight now Brian actually to Paul Hick who is in air traffic control in Dublin Paul can you hear me\n<$B> Yes Miriam Yeah uhm\n<$A> Can you give us the whereabouts of where Airforce One is at the moment Paul\n<$B> I can, he 's just lined up on final approach for the active runway, he 'll be landing in about uh three minutes ' time that 's just slightly behind schedule Meanwhile we 've uh frozen all normal movement in and out of the airport The Air Corps have their armed patrols up and uh the Fougas are airborne for the uhm for the official flight, fly-past after uh President Clinton leaves his aircraft\n<$A> Obviously for not just everybody in the country but for you in air traffic control this is a special day\n<$B> It is very much yeah, yeah a little bit of  disruption uhm but uh I suppose it is uh an unusual event to have a a president of the US visit us and uh actually I was here in sixty-three when Kennedy uh arrived Wasn't such tight security then, this thing has probably grown since then\n<$A> We 're probably seeing, is that Airforce One can we 're seeing at the moment Paul\n<$B> Uh yes Miriam he 's about uh five miles out now you can see him from the airport and uh he 'll shortly be landing\n<$A> And uh you 've obviously been in touch with the pilot of Airforce One have you\n<$B> Yes he 's been working our frequency uh and our radar for about the last thirty forty miles and uh <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> final for the runway and uh he 'll land shortly\n<$A> Okay Paul Hick Thank-you very much\n<$B> Okay Miriam Bye,\n<$A> Absolutely It was raining here earlier but the elements have lifted I think it 's a very happy and special day for everybody and the weather has taken that into account and now the sun is shining here at Dublin, About an hour ago the press corps from the White House arrived in a seven four seven similar to the one coming down now, a hundred and fifty of them And they 've gone on to the A/ras,  Yes Proinsias de Rossa, Minister for Social Welfare and Mrs de Rossa will be there The other six people will be the US ambassador obviously to this country, Jean Kennedy-Smith, the Irish ambassador to the US, Dermot Gallagher and his wife Maeve, the Secretary to the Government, Mr Frank Murray, Secretary to Department of Foreign Affairs, Padraig McKiernan, Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General McMahon, Garda Commissioner, Mr Culligan, and then finally Mr and Mrs Roberta and Dennis Sandberg,  that 's the, they 're the deputy head of the mission here in the US Embassy That in all will be the greeting party, Just about to touch down, and, it has in fact touched down It was a beautiful shot there, Air Force One travelling to north County Dublin, Before the President disembarks, two people will go into the plane, that is Jean Kennedy-Smith the US Ambassador here and the Chief of Protocol here, Mr John Burke from Foreign Affairs They will both go up and greet the President before he comes down, Out on the tarmac now there is total silence, the anticipation of the arrival, Interestingly a lot of the people who will be coming out with the President have Irish names A lot of his cabinet have names like Kitty Higgins, Mairead Hail, Kevin O'Keefe, Sean Brophy Obviously a large Irish-American contingent in his staff, And you could  see that throughout yesterday in the North, particularly in Derry actually where there was singing and dancing, he seemed to relish it, really enjoy it, As well as the President and his staff coming out of the front of the plane, also at the same time you 'll see fourteen people walk out They are the White House press corps that travel everywhere with President Clinton, President Clinton is of course the fourth president of the United States to fly through Dublin airport John Fitzgerald Kennedy in the summer of sixty-three, Richard Nixon in the seventies, and then Ronald Reagan, who departed from Dublin airport over ten years ago,\n\n<$A> It did It also shows how Irish roots have been found in both sides of Congress Aer Rianta this morning have laid out three hundred feet of red carpet, six hundred crash barriers and a hundred and fifty metres of red rope to prepare for this visit, No absolutely And reaction obviously to the President 's visit yesterday in Belfast was that he was terribly even-handed up there also He was very conscious of being even-handed to both communities, And a moment ago there Brian we saw President Mary Robinson and her husband Nick flanked by the Chief of Staff of our Defence Forces, Lieutenant General Gerry McMahon, and the General Officer Commanding Eastern Command Brigadier General Bill Dwyer, Very soon also a flight of Fouga jets, four of them from the Air Corps will fly past in salute, There 's extraordinary atmosphere, total silence out here in Dublin Airport on the tarmac as we await President Clinton, Out of shot at the moment the greeting party has lined up waiting for President Clinton to disembark, Don't worry about those grey clouds, where I 'm looking from on the tarmac the sky is blue, A little earlier Mary Elizabeth Bruton, John and Finola Bruton 's young daughter was practising how she 's going to have her big day and give the flowers to the First Lady, What you can't see at the moment is out of the back of the plane have emerged that press corps and many of the President 's officials There now is Mary Elizabeth Bruton, Her father there, John, Although it 's solemn and there is silence Brian, there 's also a lot of anticipation and happiness which you could see there in Finola Bruton 's face People are very excited about his visit, All his speeches yesterday in Belfast were marked and in Derry by that feeling of hope, the importance that people can take over their own lives, can go forward, can look forward to peace if they 'd just take control of their own lives, I 'm looking and I haven't seen them go in, they haven't gone, no they haven't gone in yet I 've just been told but I have the protocol here and that is apparently what will happen, or is expected to happen I should say, You just saw there Brian a glimpse of the media interest here There 's a battery of cameras awaiting the President and the First Lady and crews from all over the world as yesterday, Both the communique/ and obviously his extraordinarily successful visit to the North yesterday will have buoyed him up I 'm sure he was looking forward to coming here anyway but this must make him even more excited about coming, And in both places, we saw it in Derry in particular and later I saw it at the Belfast City Hall, he kept going and talking and shaking hands with people He almost ignored his Secret Service agents and just wanted to mix with the people, You can see there Brian at the moment Jean Kennedy-Smith and John Burke at the bottom of the steps, Yes, there, It does though with praise to Foreign Affairs and Aer Rianta seem an extraordinarily well-planned visit and  this  this morning here everything was just very well organised, very well planned and much more relaxed than yesterday at Aldergrove, Later on the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces is going to present a special plaque to the President It 's an enlarged version of the Defence Forces crest and cap badge and there goes Jean Kennedy-Smith and John Burke up the steps, And I heard her talking this morning on the radio actually about that visit She was with him in nineteen sixty-three and she said today will make her cry because she will think back to that day, The extraordinary thing about nineteen sixty-three, Brian you were here, obviously I wasn't, was that even now when people watch the footage they cry It was obviously so emotional,\n\n<$A> Now it looks like Jean Kennedy-Smith is re-emerging with John Burke, So any moment now we should see President Clinton and Hillary come down those steps, And like John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Bill Clinton has also got a very strong wife who in her , her in her own right there is a lot of public interest in, And as he said yesterday in Derry talking about John Hume, people have been to visit so often from Ireland he felt he had to come to back before any of those came back again, Now here he comes, President Bill Clinton and the First Lady Hillary, Greeting immediately the President Mary Robinson, and her husband Nick, the Taoiseach, Mrs Finola Bruton, Ta/naiste Dick Spring, and his wife Christy Spring who is of course American, Proinsias de Rossa, Minister for Social Welfare, and Mrs de Rossa, This is the Irish ambassador to the United States Dermot Gallagher and his wife, Maeve Gallagher, Secretary to the Government Frank Murray They 've moved away, but Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs, Padraig McKiernan, and now the Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General McMahon, Garda Commissioner Mr Culligan, and Dennis Sandberg and his wife Roberta Chief of Staff, GOC Eastern Brigade Bill Dwyer, Now he 's smiling and waving to the crowds who have been waiting patiently on the top of the departure building, He 's coming down now to inspect the guard of honour  consists of one hundred personnel from all ranks drawn from the Second Infantry Battalion based at Cathal Brugha Barracks in Dublin This is under the command of Captain Dermot Fell, The defence forces here in large numbers this morning, The twenty-one gun

{"text": "<Hurling 2>\n\n\n<$A> Match underway straightaway Interesting stat from the first half There were only ten frees in all in spite of the fact that it was a tough first half and there were uh six of them to Galway, four to Kilkenny The margin, at the moment a mere two points, Kilkenny the leaders Brendan Keogh then for a revamped Galway side, and it 's showing many switches in attack once again Ian Burke trying to take the ball up onto his stick kept away by Liam Simpson goes back there to Joe McGrath hooking up with his brother Michael, Eddie O'Connor under the dropping ball in the sunshine at Croke Park out to Liam Keogh on his wingback <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> the ball to the centre towards P J Delaney Delaney turning at the target, firing in the shot and putting it over the bar Looking rapier sharp early on with his second point of the game So three between them\n<$B> It 's a perfect start for Kilkenny during the second half and again there 's loads of them there the Galway forwards When the ball was hit in towards the Kilkenny fullback line they were all over the place Nobody inside waiting at the edge of the square to contest the ball\n<$A> Joe Cooney is now at midfield alongside Pat Malone Michael Coleman is the latest one to be tried on Pat O'Neill That 's uh four opponents so far that O'Neill has had And that 's wide by Brendan Keogh, Tom Helebert contesting, breaking down here to the number twelve who 's Joe Cooney Padraig Kelly, dropped down brilliantly by Bill Hennessey P J Delaney and Hennessey almost getting in uh one another 's way comes out from Murty Killalea to Joe Cooney Getting a bit more freedom at midfield Up towards Brendan Keogh Referee 's whistle has sounded for that push there on Brendan Keogh by Liam Simpson Galway will have the free in, Making no mistake with it Just inside the right-hand post A superb point now in this final for Joe Cooney, Bill Hennessey over there, that 's uh knocked away from him however Reaches Michael Coleman Joe McGrath walloping or Joe Cooney rather walloping it forward first time to the other Joe Joe Rabbitte Rabbitte getting free Looking for a score Hooked Kept away from danger and it 's gone wide Good defensive play involving Pat Dwyer and Liam Simpson\n<$B> I think it 's very good play here by uh Pat Dwyer The ball 's knocked away from Joe Rabbitte and again uh knocked ball here for a wide ball by Galway Very good defending by Kilkenny and again good at covering off like that\n<$A> Michael Walsh now getting the great distance into his uh puck out They were noticing the wind factor at half-time with the uh flags, the Artane Boys ' Band and that 's picked up there by Michael Phelan The wind very definitely supporting the Cats in this second half Kilkenny looking for more scores Gerry McInerney leaves it behind And that 's uh driven over the bar by P J by P J Delaney P J Delaney the scorer\n<$B> To be honest Ger I think Michael Phelan actually picked the ball off the ground for that ball and uh Galway got a bit unlucky there\n<$A> And they got away with it It 's back with the action Michael Coleman being challenged by John Power back there, and coming away for it is Joe McGrath McGrath trying to turn in for the score Again it comes off the chest of Michael Welsh Liam Simpson now Making the clearance on the out as far as Liam Burke Across towards Michael Hoppy McGrath Must get a score here And he does First point of the match for Michael McGrath Two points the difference, the flags flying proudly up on Hill Sixteen\n<$B> Well here you see Liam Simpson poor clearance really by Liam Simpson and uh gathered by Liam Burke who knocks the ball across quite well and this is what Galway must do, have somebody inside waiting for those balls and Michael McGrath scores a lovely point\n<$A> John Power has been switched by Kilkenny He 's right half forward right now Liam Welsh coming into the centre Liam McCarthy I should say McCarthy outside here to Adrian Ronan Ronan on his way once again, stopped there by, Paul Cooney Bill Hennessey picking it up On his left-hand side looking for the score and Bill Hennessey drives it over the bar A score by Bill Hennessey extending Kilkenny 's lead to three points, in the sixth minute of the second half\n<$B> Well again great play by Adrian Ronan who uh under pressure spots a loose man outside as Bill Hennessey backing him up very well scores a lovely point, And again uh Kilkenny has switched D J Carey back out on to the half forward line Now John I 'd say they 'd like to see him getting more involved in the game and uh get a few scores as well\n<$A> He wasn't that particularly prominent in the first half, had some good moments Michael McGrath likewise Playing it inside towards the tall Joe Rabbitte Looking at the post, Getting the score A first by Joe Rabbitte Again the margin two points They go point for point at either end\n<$B> Again very good play by Hoppy McGrath who uhm is coming very much more into the game knocks the ball across at Joe Rabbitte who scores a very good point\n<$A> Michael Welsh 's huge puck out going way down field, John Power, challenged by Gerry McInerney getting it inside towards PJ Delaney <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> up inside Murty Kellegher coming back needing support, getting it from Sean Tracey Tracey the Galway fallback, That was Liam Burke having to go in where it hurts to try and make the contact challenge Michael Phelan, and Joe Cooney trying to be clever and take that ball up into his hands didn't succeed Instead it 's Bill Hennessey for Kilkenny, racing clear of Joe McGrath Lovely hand pass to his right-hand side and it was read splendidly by Padraig Kelly Magnificently away by Kelly The game hotting up even more in this second half We 're really looking for some excellence from two good teams But that 's gone wide from Liam Keoghan Well, Pete Finnerty is about to be introduced into the Galway team Will he come in at half back Jarleth Coonan there the team coach getting the word of advice an instruction to the number seventeen Pat O'Neill Partially blocked down Cleared out by Liam Simpson Joe Cooney challenging for it it 's won by Michael Phelan for Kilkenny Runs down there Padraig Kelly That was a great intervention a few minutes ago there Kilkenny were being very clever Nice play but uh Galway had read the intentions well\n<$B> Ger I  I wouldn't be surprised if Galway introduced Pete Finnerty at right corner back <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> do a lot of damage and uh Paul, Paul Cooney has been struggling quite a lot there\n<$A> Michael Phelan Padraig Kelly What a game he 's playing Coming out, winning possession against uh his latest opponent John Power Joe Rabbitte, at the end of this one, picking it up low Trying to go by Liam Simpson Looking for the score and he makes it There 's only one point between the teams Rabbitte has suddenly come to life A second point by Joe Rabbitte\n<$B> Well it 's great clearance again by Padraig Kelly and Joe Rabbitte is certainly posing problems now for the Kilkenny fullback Now this is very very difficult angle Scores a brilliant point\n<$A> Joe Cooney now to contest for this one It runs over his head Runs on towards Liam McCarthy, Sean Tracey Belting it out of defence Racing across for possession there Eddie O'Connor very nearly doing what happened to Tipperary,  almost two Kilkenny men colliding there, Eddie O'Connor and Liam Keogh And thankfully there was no accident But over there right now, this looks a bit ugly Eddie O'Connor just continued his run that time as he was challenging for that ball with his uh team mate, ran into one of the uh subs or mentors in the Galway team Finger injury picked up by Joe McGrath of Galway And once again the medical officer being called on there So playing in his very first All-Ireland final the man from Kiltormer now is being marked by Willie O'Connor The battle-scarred Brendan Keogh being marked by Liam Simpson Galway against the wind have lifted their game somewhat in the second half, Michael Phelan, contesting in there with Joe Cooney Phelan again, but Padraig Kelly inevitably, like a magnet the ball seems to reach him every time That 's Tom Helebert, nice ball inside one to trouble the full back, Pat Dwyer And he coped so well Then having the vision to spot that Keoghan was unmarked To the centre of the field Pat Malone Really played well in the first half This is Justin Campbell now, towards Brendan Keogh Simpson winning the race for Kilkenny A title now which can go either way The next ten minutes certainly look as if they will be critical ones Helebert This tightly-balanced All-Ireland hurling final Brendan Keogh taking possession, looking for the equalising score played inside It 's Eddie O'Connor is there first Mistakes being made, but it 's uh as you 'd expect in Finals That 's Liam Burke making a great save and Michael Welsh making amends as well And Pat O'Neill lifts the siege Defence has turned into attack but only momentarily as Gerry McInerney is there on the centre half back position for Galway Not a good clearance It reaches Bill Hennessey on his left-hand side, firing it in there A great catch and a fine clearance for the full back Sean Tracey Justin Campbell once again Stick is broken Willie O'Connor getting a half block on that one Liam Simpson turning on his right-hand side down towards Michael Phelan Cooney going in there Just doing enough to keep it away from the Kilkenny men On towards Michael McGrath Again a good ball played inside there Rabbitte trying to get at the end of it to trouble the , trouble the full back Joe Rabbitte angling for a shot, and they 're level A succession of points by Joe Rabbitte means that they 're level for the third time in the match Fourteen points apiece One eleven to one eleven\n<$B> And again great play here by Galway and uh you see Michael Welsh here, brilliant save, and uh because the Kilkenny forwards certainly can't get into the game at this stage Ger and the Galway backs are growing in confidence all the time\n<$A> Galway backs growing in confidence Galway forwards likewise Giving as good as they 've been getting and this the save once again from the camera that 's behind the goal What a wonderful save that was by Michael Welsh Shades of the dad with that save no doubt So Willie O'Connor to take the sideline cut Fumbled Justin Campbell beaten for it by Michael Phelan Runs onto Joe Cooney There were those who said that he wouldn't do the business at midfield but he 's done it Across towards Eddie O'Connor A tough tight competitive All-Ireland final, and the issue very much hanging in the balance Just as Kilkenny try to relaunch their ambitions once again through P J Delaney And Delaney has just put it to the right and wide Was only twenty last July Today playing in his first All-Ireland final It 's been a long time since we had a draw in the All-Ireland hurling final But there 's a lot of time still left in this I make it seventeen minutes to go Pat O'Neill put under pressure Broken down by Brendan Keogh picked up by Michael Coleman shouldered by Simpson <unclear> several words </unclear> And the save is made by Michael Welsh And that was a save from Liam Burke Well Burke might have scored against Olly 's son earlier but his dad watched the son make a fine save from point blank range\n<$B> And again good play by Justin Campbell who spots a loose man across here and uh you know again good save by Michael Welsh with Joe Rabbitte coming in just knocks it off for a sixty-five But the  so the Galway forwards are certainly getting the openings now and Kilkenny are going to have to tighten up or Kilkenny are going to have to tighten up in defence certainly because Galway are growing in confidence all over the field\n<$A> And that 's gone over the bar, Joe Cooney, puts Galway, in front Galway in front by one twelve to one eleven Joe Cooney 's fourth point of the match, So the contest ferocious as you 'd expect in a final Won back there again by Padraig Kelly Knocked away from his own goal by Willie O'Connor Willie in pursuit here, getting support from Liam Simpson against Justin Campbell Who 's going to win the All-Ireland of nineteen ninety-three Runs on to Brendan Keogh Going to the right Won't be a score Tenth wide of the match for Galway and that is four now in the second half Simpson across towards Eamon Morrissey now operating his right half forward against Padraig Kelly Trying to uh somehow limit the effectiveness of the Galway number seven And it 's another wide yet again It 's becoming very monotonous Jimmy", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source":

on really well on the far side It 's a tight photo between number two Flame of Athens who was in front just before the post We just uh see now in the replay whether uh Sweet Robin grabbed her, on the line\n<$A> Well Sweet Robin looked well and truly stuffed at this stage as she loses her place and uh hangs in behind uh Long Beach at this stage I thought she was  well and truly scuttled there But in the centre coming now with what I thought looked like a winning run for a few strides there was Ribot 's Secret, uh the blue with the yellow And in between the two of those is uhm, John Reid on Flame of Athens uh this well-bred uh, son of uh Flame of Tara and Royal Academy And he gets his head in front here Now shakes off Ribot 's Secret on his right And but on the extreme inside in the Sheikh Mohammed colours Frankie Dettori 's getting another run out of uh Sweet Robin and uh closes that, in the last fifty yards But at this stage I still thought that Flame of Athens had the upper

at the line yet Flame of Athens on the John Reid, keeping his head out stretching well Now Sweet Robin on the far side is getting closer It 's on the nod but, we haven't got to it yet I think Uh Flame of Athens has just held on, Flame of Athens from Sweet Robin, and at Long Beach in third That 's the way, we see it We could be wrong Ribot 's Secret third I should 've said,\n<$C>  What an exciting

{"text": "<World Cup return>\n\n\n<$A> And as you join us you can see the huge crowd gathered here in College Green I must say that I have never seen anything like the size of the crowd I 've never seen anything like the enthusiasm And they 've been waiting here for four or five hours most of them And just drink in that atmosphere It really is quite fantastic The road from Rome, leading to Westmoreland Street And the crowds who 've been waiting some of them from two o'clock this afternoon, giving vent to their emotions and their enthusiasm And I 'm sure that Jack Charlton and the rest of the team have never ever experienced anything quite like this We heard saw Jack there at the airport almost lost for words But look at this As the bus carrying the team and the officials and the players Is almost enveloped in the sea of emotion as the citizens of Dublin representing the citizens of Ireland offer their congratulations, and show them the only way they can, with enthusiasm and good humour And one can't help but feel a lump in one 's throat watching this unbridled enthusiasm and good spirits And as we were saying earlier on the achievement of the team and Jack Charlton has been one of success against the odds, success where people didn't expect them to succeed and the giving of not just a hundred percent of effort, but a hundred and fifty percent each man in each game The excitement of that incredible draw against England in the opening game when Kevin Sheedy got the equaliser and I 'm sure that the cheers for that reached mammoth proportions on any Richter Scale There was a bit of a disappointment in the performance against Egypt but the draw got us a valuable point And then came that remarkable comeback against the Netherlands when Niall Quinn got in for that dramatic equaliser and that was the goal that saw Ireland getting into the last sixteen Paul McGrath we saw there so delighted and listen to the crowd chanting the Paul McGrath rap, I think that bus is going to take a long time to get the last few yards into the College Green centre, Because if the crowd behind the bus looks pretty dense on our television screen I can tell you that the crowd in front of the bus is even more dense Fantastic And it really was John Aldridge there who ran so much in all of those games and caused the opposing defences so many problems And I 'd say Jack seems to be more concerned about the safety of the spectators as they cheer and get so close to the bus But it really is an impossible task for the drivers I mean look at that That is the scene that awaits them as they come round the corner of College Green In front of Trinity College, in the background is Trinity College and there, vantage points in the windows, on the roof of Trinity College, rooves around College Green occupied as fans, wave flags and offer their congratulations, One looks back at that remarkable victory over Romania when the game went to penalties and I remember looking at the picture of Jack Charlton when Packie Bonner made the save and there was that ruthless smile on his face as much as to say, I knew it all along And when nobody really gave the Republic of Ireland a chance against Italy, Jack Charlton was uhm able to say, we 'll put the pressure on them They 're going to have to change their game and they 're going to know they 've been in a match And indeed that was so true because having enjoyed that match disappointed that Ireland didn't get the result that they 'd wanted but, we all know that the Irish team gave the fancied Italians a real fright, And so the bus inches its way and Jack more concerned about the safety of the people who have been waiting to welcome them  And the anthem of Italia ninety, as it has been sung the length and breadth of Ireland in the last few weeks greets Jack Charlton and the Republic of Ireland team This has been the biggest ever civic reception in the history of Dublin No warmer reception has ever been made and there 's an interesting picture At Jack Charlton 's right hand, David O'Leary The man who had the strength of character and courage with that final penalty, to shoot to the right and get it into the net and bring Ireland into the quarter finals A man that many people thought had the strength of character to be in the side and when called upon he was equal to the occasion, It really is difficult to describe the enthusiasm and the scenes The youngsters in Ireland who have been so well behaved as they waited for so long and now the moment has come when they can see Packie Bonner, they can see Dave O'Leary, they can see the Irish side Joe Delaney who is in charge of security There he is trying to wave them back and say, my job isn't over yet And the enthusiasm that the Irish supporters brought right round Italy from Cagliari to Palermo to Genoa and then to Rome is now seen in all its  exuberance as it was back home during those thrilling and exciting matches in the preliminary stages and then in the heat final and last night in the quarter-final These were the scenes that all of us enjoyed in so many  hostelries as Ireland really celebrated the magnificent performance of a team that will be remembered On the platform you see the MC 's trying to get a little bit of order and make room for the honoured guests who are of course the Irish team And <&Irish> An </&Irish> Ta/naiste Brian Lenihan there and of course the, this being a joint civic and State reception The, Dublin Corporation of course represented by Senator Sean Haughey the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the government represented by all the official ministers and the Ta/naiste Brian Lenihan the senior  dignatory from the government at the moment on the stand, And the band that has been encouraging the, and entertaining the huge crowd all afternoon, still going strong And welcoming the Irish team And there, I was mentioning about the vantage points around College Green Well just, look at that for enthusiasm, for excitement, for joy, and for welcome And Jack Charlton said after the European Championships, who knows what it would be like if they won something Well they 're everywhere aren't they showing that Ireland have won the hearts of world soccer with their performances in the World Cup, their first time ever in the World Cup Their supporters who travelled with them in spite of the lack of tickets and were in such good humour around the world or around Italy Won the hearts of all their opponents Frank Stapleton, one of the great servants of Irish football who would love so much to have been a part of the actual playing, Liam Rapple one of the great stalwarts of the FAI also there, and the Lord Mayor present and enjoying the excitement as Jack Charlton acknowledges the cheers that have been rising deafeningly from College Green all afternoon and now reaching a crescendo David O'Leary almost a little worried wondering how they 're going to make it Andy Townsend beside him Every inch of the way, the crowd cheer them as the team bus stops outside the Bank of Ireland where this team reception will be held And while we look at the, and remember the heroics of Packie Bonner and Dave O'Leary and Mick McCarthy the captain, and Kevin Moran in the defence and the efforts of Tony Cascarino, the goals of Niall Quinn and Kevin Sheedy We also remember the players who were also in the panel but didn't get on the field to play We remember <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> we remember Gerry Peyton the reserve goalkeeper, the first man to congratulate Packie Bonner when he made that marvellous save in the match against Romania Tony Butler, the promotions executive of the FAI who has done such wonders for the FAI, in terms of generating sponsorship Joe Delaney there as well The players, really concerned I 'd say as to how the bus is going to make its way through to the entrance to the bank which is in Foster Place The officials trying to say to them to hold their positions, Steve Staunton, Liam Rapple there behind him And look at the enthusiasm The players really enjoying this remarkable occasion Frank Feely, the Dublin City Manager must be proud of the way Dublin has risen to this occasion Nobody could have expected this And Dublin 's own Niall Quinn, the scorer of that great goal against Holland, and he took the rebound from the Dutch keeper and struck it safely home And that was the valuable point that saw Ireland getting through from the preliminaries But we remember too the great contribution of all the players who played in ensuring that Ireland would get through to the World Cup finals for the first time Many of those in the panel but not used in the course of the games played in Italy, but they were there supporting and ready to step in if required And as any football manager will tell you, the support players, the other players in the panel, every bit as important to the success of the team as the players on the field, The scene in Dame Street, looking up Dame Street with the Bank of Ireland on your right And the noise, the shouting, and the cheering really reflecting the views of everybody in Ireland who are so proud of the marvellous effort made by Jack Charlton made by the players in the course of Ireland 's first ever performance or appearance in the World Cup finals <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> the assistant manager and this is Bibi Baskin,\n\n<$A> Thank-you Bibi Certainly the excitement and enthusiasm has uh caught everyone 's imagination and uh it 's been really hard to hear even what one 's thinking and uh Bibi up there in the middle of all that excitement uh really finding it difficult to uhm even hear herself But what can one say looking at those exciting pictures <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> these joyful pictures, with so many people who 've spent so long in College Green waiting to say, well done, waiting to show their appreciation and enthusiasm now that they have their chance They 're not going to let it go by It 's been a long hard day I should imagine, for the players There was a disappointment for them last night that they didn't get the result that they really believed they could achieve And it 's only understandable that there was a slight feeling of disappointment this morning But I 'm sure all that has been really brushed aside by the nature of the welcome that they received at Dublin Airport and all the way in from Dublin Airport this has been the sort of smiling cheering crowds that they have seen It 's been the slowest journey into Dublin Airport into the centre of Dublin I 'm sure in history I 'm really sure it 's probably been the happiest We talked about vantage points I 'm not too sure that that 's the safest place in the world to be but they 're going to have a good view when eventually the players get in to Foster Place And I think it 's also fair to say this morning that the spectators and the crowds here have been so well-behaved", "subdomain":

{"text": "<On the Edge 1>\n\n\n<$A> It was coming up to the time when we really had to book And I had said to my husband right, I 'm going to take Darren to the doctor I 'm going to find out what 's going on and then he 'll get on and get the holiday organised It was a Monday We went to the doctor, and he said, that he was worried about it and he said I would like you to go to the Royal and have an X-ray, but I will stay here until I hear from you And at the time I didn't think anything of it So we went to the Royal It was a beautiful afternoon And sat in the Royal until Darren had his X-ray, And they came out then after a few hours and said that his X-ray was fine and uhm, they would give him some physiotherapy So they said they would organise it and they would let him know So we came home I rang the doctor and at the time the thing I remember most was, when I said to him well they said everything 's fine there was just silence on the other end of the phone And then he said oh well, that 's okay Angela but if you want to bring him down again you know, do so Now on the Friday morning, I got this phonecall at home, to say, it was the Royal and that they would like me to bring Darren down again So I got Darren out of school, and went down, to be met by a consultant, who said that he was very concerned, about the X-ray That when the X-ray had actually been reported on, they uh weren't happy with the findings, and they would like me to go to Musgrave Park So, we made an appointment and went to Musgrave Park My husband and I both went with Darren He wasn't unduly concerned I have to say, and took great delight in saying I told you so, I told you there was something wrong with me and you wouldn't listen to me you know while I had all these guilt feelings that you do have But uhm, never for one minute, expecting to hear what they did actually say We were told about this swelling that had appeared in Darren 's arm, and that there was cause for concern He said that he would need treatment to try and reduce the swelling, that the bone was affected but what they hoped to be able to do was to remove the bone, and put in a prosthesis They said we would have to go to Birmingham for this but before that would happen Darren would have to have some treatment to try and reduce the swelling Nobody had ever mentioned cancer Nobody had mentioned tumour They had just mentioned this swelling  He was very, very upfront about it, more upfront than what we were, I think to him, he didn't actually fully grasp you know what it was going to entail But after the first bout of chemotherapy he certainly knew what what 'd hit him Wasn't impressed, uhm didn't like it one bit, and told them so But they managed to persuade him you know that this would do him good, at the end of it all I think because he knew he was going to Birmingham and they said he needed a few sessions so he was quite happy to put up with that But when we went back on the Friday, the swelling in Darren 's arm had actually grown bigger, and there was great concern about this And we were told we had to go to Birmingham right away Darren and I flew over, Campbell and Paul stayed behind, which, is a nightmare, because when you 're split like that and you 're going away, you have absolutely nobody else to uhm, talk to to confer with to, to say what you 're thinking or what you 're feeling So we went there and Darren was measured for his prosthesis We then came home again, for Darren to try the the chemotherapy again It wasn't to be It I mean chemotherapy just wasn't working at that particular time So we had to go back to Birmingham  and they would have to operate Darren had to go to theatre Campbell flew over on the Wednesday and Paul had to stay with with family It was a very rough time for him, They, they were quite hopeful So were we So was Darren They had told me they would ring up and they would let me know how things were going But as the afternoon moved on, that didn't materialize, and I was more and more certain in my own mind that something, quite drastic had happened So about a quarter to five the staff nurse came and said you know go down to the office and Professor <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> coming up and he 's going to have a word with you And in fact I was actually Dr Carter who came up, and he, said that he was very sorry, that uhm, this tumour had uh actually got such a hold that it was impossible to save Darren 's arm And we were absolutely devastated Uhm, not as much as what we were later on whenever we discovered the extent of it I didn't actually realize that they had actually taken his shoulder and his arm, away altogether That 's absolutely horrendous, to say the least His dad was brilliant I went to pieces He came up from from ICU the next day and was absolutely, brilliant I don't know where they get the courage from or where they get the energy from He wanted to see what it looked like And on the Saturday morning Sister was pulling her hair out because Darren apparently had gone to the loo and started to un-bandage himself to see what what was behind the the this camouflage Once he seen it he was, I wouldn't say quite happy, but he had actually faced up to it and he knew what was behind it and it was no big problem to him then We coped I mean you don't get up in the morning and say oh today I 'm going to cope or you don't go to bed at night and say oh I 've coped today You carry on because unfortunately, you have to carry on Darren 's attitude was that he had a lot to do and he was going to get on with it and this having just one arm was not going to stop him We had very very very mixed emotions Uhm, we were very proud of him on one hand, and at other times very angry because we felt he was trying to do too much He really couldn't deal with people staring at him as if he was uh in his words a freak which had happened actually when when we were in Birmingham and they had, four or five of them had gone out to get videos, and of course there was some in wheelchairs you know there was some on crutches and Darren had the one arm, you know and they had sort of gone along in a line apparently down the road And uh, you know he said that you know he could see the people looking at them You could see the people looking out the bus windows at them You could see the cars And when he came back, and was saying this you know he said oh the freak show has returned In a way I was very angry that anybody would look on my child as a freak But in another sense I was very proud you know because he had this this way of dealing with it People 's reaction affects you a great deal Some people want to cross the street Some people drop their head Some people do ask you how you 're doing how he was doing And I know it 's very difficult, but it is actually very difficult for you, and in the end you end up, trying to put people at their ease so they can speak to you which makes it doubly hard But, Darren made it very easy, for everybody His friends didn't treat him any differently which I I was very surprised about The people that he, was close to he continued to be close with He decided that he wanted to do photography and, he uh, went to Rupert Stanley Set about uhm getting a camera Didn't want one of these automatic things that did everything He wanted a camera that he actually had to set up and work the lens and all the rest but with one arm it 's very difficult But Musgrave Park came up with this shoulder-holster thing that he could put on and he could attach his camera to which then left his hand free He uhm, got himself a girlfriend called Sharon, went off to Scotland went to London He uhm did quite a lot of things became very very positive We on the other hand sort of struggled from day to day It was never actually mentioned You know nobody ever said sort of what the end of result of this was going to be  That Christmas we actually decided right we 're going to have a brilliant Christmas We organised loads of things absolutely loads of things We didn't give ourselves any time at all, uhm to think about it And then in the February of eighty-nine, we got this letter asking us to bring, for Darren to go for a scan And, for whatever reason, the hairs on the back of my neck just started to prickle, and I couldn't figure out why because Darren had been going for his chemotherapy There had never been any mention of going for a scan And I decided right, I 'm going to find out more about it So I made an appointment with the consultant It was absolutely tipping down with rain It was a Thursday afternoon And I went, and I met him and I said to him you know why this And he said well you know Darren 's had an X-ray and things aren't really looking very good And I said but he 's had his chemotherapy And he said yes he has, uhm but unfortunately it didn't do the trick So then I said to him, you know is it is it really that bad And he said yes So that was me he had this this woman who was pacing up and down, his floor asking him these questions which he didn't really want to  to be asked and which he certainly didn't want to answer But this this this parent who who wanted to get to the bottom of it So then I said to him you know uhm is Darren going to die, And he said yes he is, So, uhm, he said yes He says unfortunately Darren is going to die And I said to him, you 'll most probably not want to answer this but is there a timescale And he said yes He said, uhm I would 've would reckon that Darren wouldn't live much, after about eight months You keep hoping that that they 've made a mistake that it 's somebody else they 're talking about, that, uhm, they 've got the wrong X-rays they 've got the wrong reports they 've got everything wrong you know that it 's not actually going to happen to your son The following Tuesday, we took Darren to down to hospital again He went in I as usual sat outside And he came out, and Dr Robertson just said that uhm Darren didn't want any more chemotherapy And I just looked at him, in amazement And I never spoke I never said a word, And he just said you know we 'll send for Darren, uhm for his X-rays and bloods as usual, So we came out and got into the car, and I drove up the motorway like an absolute lunatic, absolute lunatic, shouting at this child you know and why are you not having any more chemotherapy And he just said well, he said what is the point He says I have asked them is it going to cure me He has said no", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "<On the Edge 2>\n\n\n<$A> You had to put an air on of everything 's fine and all and at the same time you 're waiting on a lorry coming up to the door to take your stuff away Your head at times is ready to blow off your shoulders, but I couldn't show that Heart scared on the telephone ringing, getting up in the morning early, watching what the postman was putting in getting rid of it before the wife got up out of bed That 's the insanity of it you know And thinking whatever you 're doing 's right and everybody else is wrong I blamed everybody, my wife, you name it I blamed everybody my sisters or my brothers, it 's their fault it was the upbringing I had But it was my fault At the end of the day it was me that was writing the dockets it was me that doing the thieving it was me that wasn't bringing my wages home We were a long long time married, and I can honestly say here and now I don't know why   she put up with me She started to take severe migraine headaches which she still has to this day And there was never any money being brought home til her She could never depend on me for nothing If she gave me any money to pay anything I would always gamble it away And this was a pattern I put her through And at the same time, she 'd the odd wee job, and only for that honestly I don't know where we 'd 've been, because I never brought any money home I never gave her the only thing I done, was cause her heartache and trouble I can never remember giving my wife a free week, there was always trouble, always borrowing money always stealing money I still can't understand why my wife took it, honestly No other woman under the sun would 've took what my wife took from me \nI was in trouble, big trouble And the longer it went on the bigger the bills got, the bigger the debts became, the more people I hurt, until I just couldn't turn round One by one my friends caught me on, the banks definitely caught me on, the finance houses knew me All dried up All these channels of money seemed to be closed up And I remember sitting at the door and I went into the house and the wife knew there was something wrong She said what 's wrong with you I said I 'm in trouble She said what what do you mean you 're in trouble Say I 'm owe an awful lot of people money And she mustn't 've thought it was so much money that I owed a few quid here you know or there She said who do you owe What do you owe And I couldn't tell her I was afraid of her dropping I was afraid of her passing out you know I said I can't tell you Said how much money do you owe And she started to get annoyed And I plucked courage up and look says I Maria, I 'm going to I 'm going to tell you what money 's owed here The total sum came to about, seven thousand six hundred quid something like that there, and she couldn't believe it She couldn't believe it and I got my marching orders Get out, and take your gambling with you, and don't come back here, because if you go your debts go with you, because there 's no way we can pay that money, absolutely no way we can pay that money And I remember and it was bucketing out of the heavens, really bucketing out of the heavens And I said now where do I go now I couldn't go to none of my friends I owed them all money And I had no money on my own I had uh uh, I was just left stranded nowhere to go and my pride wouldn't let me go back to the house But I remember going to a guy 's flat in Rathcoole, I knew well God help him he had a problem too he was an alcoholic But I found him anyway and I found the flat, and asked him could I stay the night I sat there and I was soaked to the skin That 's when the whole thing started to come to a head I realised what a muck I 'd made of my life All my whole life was mucked up through this gambling I couldn't even dry my clothes We 'd no money to put in the gas thing I got up the next morning, got out, walked all the way home again, went up and rapped the door The wife opened it, she told me she said you 're not welcome here, get away, go away I said look pleaded with her let me in, let me in for five minutes And she  relented She says it 'll be for five minutes And I went into the house and I sat down didn't know where to turn til didn't know what to do Prior til this I remember her sister telling me, she says Andy you know there 's a place that people can help you But I wasn't listening til her at the time but funny enough the name stuck in my head, Gamblers Anonymous, it stuck in my head I don't know why but it stuck there But I kept looking at the phone, kept staring at the phone you know, and I remember going over and lifting the phone The guy at the other end was, very attentive, listened a lot, asked me says uh, do you gamble he said And I stopped a minute See for a compulsive gambler to admit that this has him beat, well that was me admitting it to him, this had me beat And I say yes I have if truthful, I have been gambling He said you know, we are on the Stranmillis Road and he gave me the address He says can you come up to a meeting up here Says I I 'll go anywhere, and I meant it I 'll go anywhere He says you come up here on a Wednesday night at eight o'clock He said there 's people here that 'll be able to help you That 's if you want help And I remember, my sister came down that night She found out the trouble I was in She wrote the wife a cheque for a hundred pound, to get her some messages and to get some stuff in the house you know And we went up together She was allowed to go on the first night but after that I had to go myself And I remember I 'm sitting there listening, but I started to hear people that were in dire trouble, worse than me, and yet, they were getting out of their trouble Things were starting to work out for them They were starting to smile and I couldn't get over this you know I sees people smiling why are they laughing And the secretary of the group meeting that night seen the state I was in and took me in til another room, to counsel me And we got a cup of coffee, and he says calm down He started to talk to me And I thought it was a money problem It 's money I owe this money money money I was always talking about money He says it 's not money Andy Money 's not your problem Gambling 's your problem Be honest he said look, if you can't be anything be honest Tell the truth If you want to progress tell the truth And I told him I says yes, I have been gambling, all my life I 've known nothing else but gambling He said I 'm the same And if you follow the advice we are giving you, the rest of your life can be okay You can come round to a normal way of living And I remember going home oh it was like somebody lifting a big burden on my back I went home and I told my wife I said Maria I 've found it I know now I don't have to gamble, I don't have to And I was, great form never gambled all that week, went to a couple of meetings that week This thing was starting to work out I got a wee job, carrying coal only the heaviest thing I ever carried was pound of sugar, it near murdered me But the money I was getting, the wife was getting it, and it was going towards paying debts That 's where all that money was going til And I 'm feeling great I 'm feeling great There 's a door open There 's a wee light at the end of that tunnel but I can make it bigger  I haven't a bet it 's coming up on ten years now from I 've been in a bookie 's shop, betting horses, or any form of gambling From I arrested this gambling problem, my whole life could not be better I 'm not lying awake half of the night now wondering what the postman 's going to put in my letterbox I 'm not lying  awake at night and wondering now what the phone 's going to ring and who 's going to be demanding money And I 'm not worrying about bringing money home now My life has completely changed it 's as simple as that It 's just a different man", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Fellowship meeting>\n\n\n<$A> I actually feel terribly rebuked in in a way really, I walk in here tonight, Willie walks in with a bag and a Bible and I walk in with a book entitled The Day I Fell down the Toilet  But my daughters gave me this  my daughters gave me this because there 's a little poem in it they knew would really appeal to my humour Let me share it with you It 's called The Wee Poem It 's by a man called Steve Turner He 's a relatively new modern uhm English poet  Please, don't be slow in taking me home, I need to go for a wee, I try to think of something else, but a wee uh just wants to wee, oh no it 's Mr Barnstaple taking his dog for a walk, please, pretend he 's invisible even if he stops for a talk, now Barnstaple has spotted you, he was just about to call, he 's got all the time in the world, and I 've got no time at all, I mustn't think of waterfalls or taps or bubbling streams, I have to cross my legs and think of mashed potatoes and greens, at last the man he walks away and I think I 'm home and dry, I want to bounce from here to there with one big leap through the sky, but suddenly my worries go, and there 's nothing more I can do, my heart is warm and so 's my leg, and there 's a squelching in my shoe   You know laughter 's great medicine Any of you have ever been to see Patch Adams It 's a film based actually on the true story of a doctor who believed laughter was a great prescription for life and for joy, and just, good medicine And yet it 's incredible the number of God 's people who haven't got that prescription Because for somehow or another and there 's a long history to it, Christians can't handle laughter Have you any of you read The Name of the Rose or seen the film by Umberto Eco And you know  it 's a fascinating, I have been fascinated by monasteries from oh for years and years and years Absolutely fascinated and of course The Name of the Rose is set in a medieval monastery, and what 's at the very heart of this monastery There 's a secret, and that secret revolves around a book that 's hidden in the very very depths of the sort of the inner sanctuary of this library and nobody is allowed to see this book And the book is all about laughter Because well you see they were afraid to laugh Now Wallace or <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> who 's a a modern writer on spirituality, he says, I just can't imagine heaven is a place where there will be no laughter But when you look at Northern Ireland you almost get to the stage you know you see people coming down the street and you think, they must be Christians, for nobody else could look that miserable  Christianity 's become an insufferably grim experience, and certainly in the Reform tradition that I come from you know it goes with a certain, the shoulder, one shoulder 's higher than the other, the neck 's a bit to the right, the suit 's dark, the glum you know glum dour look, and the glummer and dourer you are, well the holier you are We can't quite cope with laughter And yet laughter runs right through the heart of Scripture Because do you ever notice right in the middle of the patriarchal triad of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, God placed laughter, because Isaac literally means he laughs Yitzhak is the verb behind it, and you can quite easily move into that from Yitzhak to Isaac And you think of the spectrum of laughter there just in the life of Isaac, because there 's the laughter that comes the sheer incredulity of Sarah when she 's told at her age she 's going to have a child And she laughs just with sheer incredulity I could never, I could never have a child And then there 's the laughter of joy when the child is born And for the rest of her life and Abraham 's life and Isaac 's life they 're going to live with the fact he 's called laughter Now I don't know how you can explain your way around that, at the very heart of God 's plan there 's this little fellow bearing the name laughter, and sometimes in his life he 'd little to laugh about But there it 's at the heart of it But Isaac reminds us of the wonderful spectrum of laughter in Scripture, because at another point you find when Paul 's looking at this through Galatians Paul talks about Isaac 's brother or half-brother Ishmael, not laughing at him but laughing, well not laughing with him but laughing at him, because that laughter can cross the spectrum and become mockery Mockery that downplays, that deprecates, that treats somebody in a disrespectful way So running through Scripture there 's this wonderful spectrum of, of laughter There 's the laughter that the psalmists can talk about too Can I borrow this <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> one wee minute Because you get this wonderful picture Remember when Israel are talking about well what God had done for them when he brought them back and and was so good to them And they 're celebrating this in Psalm a hundred and twenty-six And again this theme of laughter 's here when they said, look when the Lord brought us back to Jerusalem it was like a dream, how we laughed How we sang for joy And the other nations said about us, the Lord did great things for them, and laughter was one of the ways of expressing that There 's just that laughter that that speaks of of just the wonder of what God 's done If we can sing Jesus for the song in our hearts I think we can equally sing you know, God can put laughter in our hearts But when you look at the beginning of the psalms, isn't it very interesting When the warning is given, now probably some of these psalms were written to young men going into positions of leadership, and one of the first things the young man is warned about in Psalm one is be sure to avoid the mockers and the scoffers, the cynics who laugh at everything, for whom nothing is sacred So within the psalms you get this range of of laughter too And I think there 's this tremendously positive side to it in the Lord where we can enjoy him, but let me explore a wee bit more of the negative side too because I think we really do need to examine laughter today It 's very striking that, you know recent historical research has shown that when Hitler was rising to power he actually had part of his government part of the Third Reich machine dedicated to creating entertainment or laughter And at one stage he said, see to it that Germans learn to laugh again But he was teaching them to laugh at home, there was a huge entertainment and night club  uh uh you know industry in in Germany, but while he was teaching them to laugh it diverted their attention away from many of their you know, their compatriots who were dying on the various battle fronts He also taught them through laughter to lower the threshold of shame, because when he had dehumanised the Jews enough it was very easy in in a sense to move from the caricature, from the cartoon, to move from deprecating them and dehumanising them, to then just obliterating them Because laughter can lower the thresholds of shame to a point where there 's no shame at all and that 's one of the worrying sides of laughter That sometimes, well, maybe we do need the courage like the good Ulster Prod to say no We 're good at saying no an Ulster Protestant is Maybe there 's some forms of laughter we have to say no to See, if you go to the website of Blind Date, I don't know, are any of you Blind Date fans It drives me batty Oh I can't, it drives me batty But if you go to the website of Blind Blind Date Cilla says, you know we 're looking for people who want to have fun and are good at the chat-up line and the put-down You see what 's at the heart of this entertainment As long as you can put somebody down And entertainment has become what, you ever watched that bit you know where the couples come back after their date and one is talking and the one they 're talking about 's in the little window Do you ever feel, you know you just cringe inside There 's another side of you says, well, you deserve it You went there on your own But the other side of it is, look at how many of these programmes today are at the expense of someone Do you ever watch the sort of that canned laughter that goes along with You 've Been Framed Somebody 's falling, it 's obviously quite humiliating, quite painful, and then they they bring in the canned laughter Or then there 's the laughter that goes along with what we call, as a society, because we can't cope with death and because we 've become embarrassed with sex, we 've got what 's called the alternative comedians The Julian Clarys, the Jo Brands And something like sexuality that was pure from God 's hands, look at the range of four-letter vocabulary terms that are now used And it 's denigrated, it 's it 's distorted, it 's discoloured, it 's disfigured, and they do the same with death Because they can't cope with it, it becomes the butt of the alternative comedian 's joke Sometimes we need very very definitely to say no to laughter, because that 's the laughter of mockery That 's the laughter that 's so lowering the thresholds of shame, that it 's dehumanising it 's at the expense of others And I suppose as a believer I had to think a bit about laughter After you know we had the full round of, of Lada jokes here for a long time You know, what 's the difference between, you know,   what do you call a a, what is it Uhm oh I can't remember them now, actually, the they 've gone from a lot of them There 's the Skoda ones as well And then I went as I do sometimes to go to teach in the Ukraine in Eastern Europe You know I never could tell a Lada joke again You know when 's a Lada not a Lada Well when it becomes a gift of God for somebody, who discovers that life 's very difficult and God makes provision for a, a Bible teacher away in some remote part of the Ukraine and he gets a an old battered Skoda or Lada, and you think of the in a sense the subtle elitism, the subtle middle-class superiority that creeps in when we tell our Lada jokes here I just couldn't laugh any longer Because there 's just some forms of laughter we have to think about And yet there are other forms of laughter that are so enormously liberating Cos what I 've discovered about laughter, especially when you, well again there 's all sorts of spectrums in it Because if you 've travelled abroad and you go into a situation where you 're the only English speaker, when people start to laugh it can make you incredibly lonely, because you 're wondering, are they laughing at me They 're not, but you can't help but feel that But then there 's other times when laughter can become this wonderfully unifying thing And what I 've discovered, especially about God 's people, you know the people who often do the best in foreign situations, they 're the people who can laugh at themselves There 's something self-effacing about it but when you can laugh at yourself it says, I 've a confidence in God here, I can afford to let people laugh at me And that 's what I 've discovered Cos you know there 's nothing, any more, well, one of the great levellers I 've discovered in life, as I say I teach a little bit in the Ukraine now and again, when you 've diarrhoea in a Ukrainian train, and the toilet doors are locked at every station, and there 's no way you can sit on the seat and the train 's rattling along, if you can't laugh you 're in desperate trouble You 're in desperate trouble Because sometimes you see the Lord can put you just into situations that it takes away all your pride Just all sense of your own importance, your own dignity, it 's a wonderful leveller in this sense Because you discover hey, who, who do I think I am When you 're caught in the midst of it There 's the laughter, I remember one of the first times I went to the Ukraine and it was actually quite hard on the family cos you go away, going away 's the easy bit, it 's the people who are left at home have the real difficulty, because they 're wondering how you are, where you are I couldn't understand before I left home and I couldn't, on those early trips there was no phones, no emails, I couldn't just get in touch with home And I couldn't understand before I went away from home, I 've two daughters, and why Heather and the two girls were sitting, they were unrolling all the toilet rolls, and taking the the heart out, the core out of them, and then putting a pencil in and rerolling them tightly because you travel in eastern Europe you never  leave home without a torch and a toilet roll Those are two essentials And I couldn't understand this and then one day I was standing in a necessarium at the bottom of a Ukrainian garden, and they had at one stage obviously got humanitarian aid because the way they decorated the toilet they had cut up all the Kellogg 's cornflakes packets and pasted them round the walls And here I 'm standing, come in girls, I 'm standing in the middle of the, <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> in the in the toilet right down the bottom of the garden and I started to unroll the toilet roll And something caught my eye, as I discovered the girls had started to write messages on it Dad, we miss you, we love you I thought you know what a wonderful way, they could teach the KGB about getting messages across the Iron Curtain", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c183db97-57d6-42a9-aa04-b16ef890eda2",

{"text": "<Enneagram talk>\n\n\n<$A> I mean everybody likes a little bit of space but for the five it 's vital There has to be some part of the day that 's just for the five where you know the five can spend time alone Okay Uhm, so they can be reclusive, generally speaking also they 're quite intellectual, not all fives but mostly This is the type who likes to be around books as well you know Knowledge again is what really they fill themselves up with Any other thing, any other words you might think sort of, a head type, uhm, the observer, uhm this is the wise person the sage sometimes they 're called the sage as well This is the type who actually makes in a sense very good counsellors and therapists because, they have a natural ability to  to detach emotionally So you can imagine that they have that ability to listen to people without becoming emotionally involved And the danger for fives is that they can as I say detach maybe too much, you know from from the from the from their emotional life and they tend to spend most of the time up in here, up in their heads Uhm I mean I know fives that could detach from you while actually in the room with you, because they just, they just go off and go up into their heads So they can be present but not really present you know with you Uhm my friend is married to uhm, a friend of mine 's married to, to her husband who was a mathematician and I always call him the invisible man because I can go into the house and I could chat away to her and actually then look over and notice that he 's been there all that time behind a newspaper or behind a book and he never says a word Now and it 's not out of rudeness or being, you know cos he would acknowledge you when you look but it 's almost like as if he can be present in the room but that not present with us So he 's already up in his head, uhm you know Uh and as I say, of all the types this is the type who values spending time alone, and it 's, like you know when I came from the two world which is like, how could anybody possibly spend so much time on their own, that would nearly be, that would be so alien to me as a two and as an extroverted two who really loves to be around people and who gets energy from being with people Well it 's the opposite for the five Fives can only, you know, they measure their time because it can be draining for them It 's almost like as if, you know too much of that, and they have to pull away to themselves and be on their own in order to sort of get their energy levels and to build themselves up again Uhm, one of the guys I think I mentioned I work very closely with from Dublin is a five on the enneagram and he comes up and does weekends with us every year and like we all love him to bits and he 's a counsellor as well and uhm you know Dan would tell us that uhm he 's married, has three grown-up daughters and all But he said like you know for example if him and his wife were going out on a Saturday you know he needs to know these things, he needs to know, what time are we leaving at and what time will we be back uhm It 's almost like, how much time have I to spend maybe doing something that he 's not necessarily comfortable with He said it 's almost as if he has had to learn in some sense social behaviour, not that they are anti-social but, like fives are not into hang-about, social chit-chat, parties where people are all ohhh, you know, fives enjoy conversations that are meaningful, they enjoy discussing something that means a lot to them So if Dan comes away with us on a weekend he really is very social and we can all discuss enneagram which is a common sort of bind of knowledge for us But he said you know, it is at home he 'll say to his wife now, she 'll say, now we have to go to such and such for a dinner party <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and Dan will say, right okay, what time do we leave at, what time will be back at And and he needs to know that, so that he needs to know that this is, you know how much time and that he 'll be back whenever you know he said he will And he said like when he was younger, you know he said his house was built and at the very top of the house he has this room that the girls call dad 's room And it 's like wall-to-wall books and and, Dan says like if he goes out and he says a book that he really wants, he mightn't just buy one copy, he might buy two copies of that book And very rarely he lends out any of his books because again, they 're very important to him, very precious to him Uhm and he said though that once his children started to arrive on the scene, he really made a commitment to be there fully, as a father to his girls, even though the the natural pull for the five is is is is sort of being on their own And uhm when we were training to teach the enneagram the biggest number training was fives and there was about eight or nine fives came from all over the world, and as soon as we would finish in the afternoon, like as soon as the day was over, and we would be maybe working from nine o'clock sometimes through to seven, the fives would continue on in the corner and they would be swapping knowledge and they would be sharing theories and they would be discussing all that had been on in the day and be quite happy to do that til all hours, you know because again, here was a common knowledge, shared knowledge, finding out more information and whatever Uhm, again as I say the danger is that they can become maybe you know too emotionally detached uhm from their feelings and uhm and and stay too much up in their head I think I said that when I had the first class in prison there was one five in the class and when we had a discussion one day around how they coped as their type with being in prison, he said it really didn't bother him that much because he quite liked it, because it was almost as if he had permission to be locked up in his room on his own So and in fact he didn't like it when they had, you know they used to have obviously cell times where they they, you know where they went in and they were locked in their cells and then that was done away with, but he quite liked when they were locked in their cells because then it meant nobody could disturb him or come in and see him or whatever So he had this absolute time alone And again his cell was wall-to-wall books and he was studying law while he was in there And he was very quiet in the class and generally speaking fives, even in the class will be quiet, unless you ask them a specific, specific question And in his case, he could think of things even that we had discussed maybe weeks before and have a theory or have a thought on that that was generally quite profound, and and fives tend to, because they do listen very intently and they do sort of study and think about it you know But uhm, I always remember that when Ellen Farmer, when I went to her weekends in Dublin, and she would bring up the panel of fives onto the stage, you know it was really interesting, you know how the fives operated For example if she asked them a question and here 's the type again who would who finds it difficult to be put on the spot and asked something without any preparation, because the the worrying or the the worrying thing for the five is well what if she asks me a question and I don't know the answer And that would really, that the five that the fives would appear stupid would be an issue for them And I can remember that she had this panel of fives up and she 'd this woman on her panel who she used a , a couple of times that I was down And this woman was an M, an MEP in Dublin and uhm so obviously well-versed in speaking on political matters and on TV and whatever And Ellen asked her a question about herself relating to her five and we all waited for five minutes and she couldn't answer And you can imagine if you 're sitting in like a, a lecture theatre with about a hundred and fifty two hundred people and everybody 's waiting for you to speak and she couldn't answer And with you know the way it 's like, five minutes and then everybody starts to rustle about, and then eventually she had to say, I can't answer that I can't answer that without having you know given it some thought You know and again, this is difficult for the fives you know to be spontaneous, to be able to sort of self-reveal can be very difficult for fives to do Fives do this thing, what 's called, again it 's unconscious, they compartmentalise their lives So for example, I could be the five and I could teach for example So I would have my friends or I would have the people that I, I work with and I, that would be in one compartment, and then I would have my family, okay, and then I might be into running and I might have people that I run with, or whatever hobby I have But like that doesn't mean, none of them will ever necessarily meet each other because they 're kept in some sense separate And the big fear for the five is that if they all sort of got together and found out about them, that would be very serious for the five And I have a friend who has taught the enneagram for years and years and I would do a lot of work with him when he was in Belfast and he 's now based in Dublin And you know he would come up regularly every New Year 's or so and I would get a call from him, right And he would phone me up and he would, or he would ring me from time to time but our conversations, the first thing he 'll say to me, it 's never how are you Frannie What 's happening uh No, he 'd say, did you read that Roy Keane autobiography Now what would be your feeling Do you think Roy Keane is this <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> Or else did you, what do you think, and he would name a politician, have you heard him lately What type do you think And everything he he would phone me about would be around the enneagram And he would come up at New Year 's and he would ring me and say, what are you doing at around six o'clock And I 'd say, well I 'm not, right I 'll call up and see you And I know that I 'm sort of slotted in between maybe six and seven So when he comes in at six o'clock, and we make a cup of tea and we would talk all the time but it would be around enneagram And then uhm I he I could nearly tell you when he 'd starts to fidget cos I know then that he has another slot with someone else that he 's involved in with something else you know, so And it 's not that that bothers me That 's the way he is and that 's just you know the way he operates", "subdomain":

{"text": "<Minister of State>\n\n\n<$A> Alderman, Education and Library Board, Chairman, chief executives, distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen, that was most generous of you and I deeply appreciate what you said For my part, I agree with you The quintessence of training I shall remember that phrase   usually  use, long words in order to uh, disguise the truth You 've used long words to exemplify it And I think that 's right What gives me particular pleasure is not so much to be associated again with the quintessence of educational training, but to look around this room and see so many people whom five and a half years ago I didn't know, and who I now consider to be personal friends That 's a measure, at a personal level, of what it has meant to me to be Education Minister in Northern Ireland for almost five years Whatever I may have done for you, at a personal level you have more than repaid it in friendship and support and encouragement and in the professionalism with which people here do their jobs And I thank you And I thank you also Chairman for inviting Betty to be part of today 's proceedings It was not my initiative that brought her across the Irish Sea this morning it was yours and I thank you for that, typically generous touch I should also start by apologising for being late Indeed uh I had to uh leave the talks with the permission of the Secretary of State and uh John Hume with whom we were actually in discussion when the clock said if I don't go now I 'll never get there, and I know that if I didn't get there Gerry Moag would give me hell for the rest of my life So I 'm uh, I apologise for that delay and it also explains why I won't be able to stay as long as otherwise I would have hoped to do One of the things I learnt when I was Education Minister was that there are some who before they want to feel the quality of education want to feel the width of the cheque This unit represents about three hundred thousand pounds of capital investment and will have a budget of about one point two million pounds a year, roughly two thirds of that coming from the Boards and uh one third from the Department Wrong Two thirds from the Department and one third from the Boards Five Chief Executives breathe a sigh of relief  I promised all of you that the necessary training for education reform would be properly funded I 'm here today to claim the fulfilment of at least part of that promise This represents a promise kept It also represents as you said Alderman Semple uh an exciting initiative between the five Education and Library Boards in the Department And I pay tribute to all six I can do it now for Department officials inasmuch as they are answerable now to someone else Their commitment to the concept of training and to this unit never wavered And all of you owe them a debt of gratitude But I know that Mr Carville and others who are here will not take it amiss if I say that this unit is really a monument to five other people When we got into the discussions of education reform, one of the things that I learned was that, it not only helped if I could take the chief executives with me, but it helped even more if I could give them opportunities to give some indication as to how we should proceed It was they who were instrumental in persuading me that the Boards ought to have a major say in training And having won that position they didn't stop but went further They then persuaded me that as well as Boards having individual responsibilities for training there was need for a central, a regional training unit so that some of the training which would otherwise have been replicated five times over could be done centrally And out of that series of persuasive discussions, this unit was born And I know what it 's called, but it is actually a monument to the five chief executives of the Education and Library Boards in Northern Ireland And whatever the title on the top of the notepaper that is how I will view it from here on in, You mentioned sir that we got on with the job I see no point in hanging around when there is a job to be done and everyone agrees that it should be done, and where it should be done, and how it should be done, and we can find the money to do it And Mr Moag reminded me that it 's probably about eighteen months since I met Mr McCullough and Canon Nolan and walked around this site and they said, This is where it 's going to be and I said, fine, and eighteen months later it 's up and running And that 's important It 's important first of all because it demonstrates that Education can get on with the job and can deliver And it is important secondly because it demonstrates that when people have clear-cut priorities and clear-cut objectives to achieve, and there is no confusion, then they can get on with doing the job in a way which is to the benefit of everyone And I congratulate all of those who have played a part in delivering this unit so quickly and to such good effect I suppose in these days of suspicion I have to say, not that it probably needs to be said, that I had absolutely no hand in picking the director, which is probably a good job because he was the year above me at school, and we 've known each other for a long time, and I 'm reliably informed that he has improved immeasurably since those days at school , and as a consequence will be a very fine director And John I wish you and your staff every possible success  This unit is here for the benefit of teachers, Board personnel, school governors, and all of those who have a role in delivering education reform It will offer them assistance in a variety of forms, that 's part of its strength But let 's not lose sight of its ultimate objective Its ultimate objective is the benefit of the young people of Northern Ireland That 's what education is all about It can't be delivered without teachers It can't be delivered without administrators It can't be delivered without civil servants Forgive me for saying so but it can't even be delivered without ministers It most certainly can't be delivered without parents But ultimately education is about children Taking the talents and abilities that they 've got and ensuring that those are developed to the maximum Whatever that talent, whatever that ability, refusing to believe that any child has got no ability, but developing, coaxing, training, stimulating, exciting, disciplining, so that they develop their full potential as men and women, to contribute to the society into which they will move from school and to enjoy the self  esteem and the self-confidence from comes, which comes from knowing that they themselves have developed as human beings That 's what this unit is about Education reform had two principles and I suspect if we had an assessment for forty-four year olds most of you would now pass, to improve standards and to give parents greater say and involvement in the education of their children And to that end, to meet those two goals a variety of objectives, a variety of changes were introduced, but they were all introduced to meet one or other or both of those goals And because it involved change, and because as human beings we don't like change very much, and in Northern Ireland we like change even less than we like it in other parts of the Kingdom, training and encouragement and help is an essential part of that delivery And that 's what this unit is about It 's about helping all of those who have a part to play in the education of our children I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that this unit will play that role, will play it under the direction of the Department, under the direction of the Boards and the five chief officers, Chief Executives to whom this is a monument We 'll do it under your direction John, and with the help and the co-operation of all of the other education and educational training bodies that are represented here, not to the greater glory of any of you, and most certainly not to the greater glory of government but to the greater glory of our children, in whom all of our futures are invested, I miss you all I 'm delighted to have been invited back to conclude this particular aspect of something which I started eighteen months ago I thank you for that honour, and I formally declare the unit open",

{"text": "<Education lecture>\n\n\n<$A> Yeah, I mean  this is an issue that comes up particularly in in in A-level Once you get beyond the compulsory examination stage the actual numbers who are doing the things can become very important Because, it would be possible to construct an argument either way using these data You could argue on the basis of percentages that girls are doing better But you could also argue that boys do better because there 's more of them end up with A-level Physics and various doors, whatever that  that that opens for them Uh sometimes in the rush to uh, sort of the moral panic around the under-achievement of boys, some of those sorts of subtleties were, were often very, got lost very quickly There still are quite, uh uh quite marked, gender differences in terms of subject choice at uhm at A-level stage And also that uh then feeds into quite marked differences in terms of uh subject choice in higher education There 's now many more girls going into or young women going into higher education than young men Uhm, but once they graduate, uh within a a shockingly short period of time, uh the young men are earning a lot more Uhm and it 's not even, it 's not even due to the young women taking time off work to have children, babies Uh the differential in earnings kicks in before that Uh and it 's part, well it 's partly related to discrimination I 'm sure in the labour market, uh but it 's partly also related to subject choice that they 're taking and the areas of, the occupational areas that they 're, they 're going into Uhm so that, that sort of difference, it 's important to keep that sort of thing in mind just in terms of the the nuances of the patterns of performance And also the consequences of those sorts of choices further down the uh further down the uh the the the line In the sort of broader debate about this uh issue on sort of boys ' under-achievement, there 's a variety of, of factors that are uh are uh are are sometimes uh linked to this Uh this is uhm a series of factors I just pulled off a uh a CCA document which was distributed to schools I think two three years ago, uhm, uh which provided some some information on the uh the various possible contributing factors to boys ' under-achievement Uhm and I 've just divided them up into well what I 've described as fundamental factors, uh genetic influences, puberty or  body-development, uh early-learning or or child-rearing practices Then a attitudes, uh explanations based on their attitudes to school, the sort of notion that boys have more of an anti-school culture Uhm and then a third one was the school factors, to do with uh some of the reasons these things are actually played out in schools, differential learning styles or the uh the role of changes in examination format or uh coursework Uh let 's sort of go through each of these in turn First of all the fundamental factors, genetic influence of puberty whatever\n\n<$A> I have heard of cases in a, in in in an institution not that far away, where uhm the, there 's a a much lower proportion of men doing the course but they are much more relaxed about doing it because they make it clear that they see themselves being Principals in a relatively short period of time once they 've finished, and not having to do very much for that inevitable destination to fall into their lap Uh and uh you know I 've been told that this is a sort of an approach which caused intense irritation  among their, their their fellow students the women I don't know whether it 's true or not I think it may just be a story,  Okay, so as I say, that was some issues around uhm gender, uh things The next thing I want to say is just a little bit about some issues around uh race in education This is an issue that uhm really uhm didn't uhm, uh uh didn't come up in a big way in Northern Ireland for very many years, I think partly because of Catholics and Protestants spent so much time uh uh throwing bricks at each other, we we live with this illusion that uh uh even though we were terribly  nasty to uh each other in those terms we were actually very nice to everyone else Uh and it wasn't, it wasn't until uhm someone uh started doing some research uh or or work in this area and started actually asking some of the ethnic minority communities uh how they were treated that we discovered that there was quite a lot of racist harassment uhm that was going on uh in in Northern Ireland Uhm and partly as a response to that uh race legislation was brought in uh in the nineteen eighties it was originally <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> nineteen nineties uh to extend some of the uhm anti-discrimination legislation uh on race that had been in  in Great Britain since the nineteen sixties into uh in to Northern Ireland And this was interesting in regard to schools because one of the things that the race legislation brought in was uh uh making it illegal to discriminate on the basis of services, which had never been involved in the uh the religion uh legislation The fair employment uh legislation which outlawed discrimination on the basis of religion had always been focused on employment, not on the provision of services This was seen as a sort of a very difficult issue to address in religious terms, partly because uhm it it could potentially, well there was a number of reasons why it was seen as a problem One of the reasons why it was a problem was uh a fear that this would cause all sorts of problems in in country areas because apparently there is a certain tradition in country areas that whenever land is sold, it 's sold within a community so local arrangements aren't disturbed, but if you were to make uh discrimination on the basis of religion for the, for the provision of goods and services illegal, that sort of practice would be illegal Uh another example that came up before the ceasefires, it was a very real issue for the civil service to try and work out How could you make it legal, if you, I mean discrimination uh on the basis of religion for services was was illegal, how could you make it legal for a taxi-driver to refuse to take someone to a certain area if the taxi driver didn't want to do that for fear that whenever he got there he 'd be shot Because that happened Sometimes people were shot, uh taxi drivers were shot after being taken to to a particular area, just, taxi, a lot of taxi companies were linked to uhm one community or the other Uh so all those issues then came up whenever this legislation came in because this made uh the provision, uh discrimination in the provision of services illegal and eventually they did extend that uhm, they did extend that uh services issue to, to religion as well But the other reason why the services thing was important for race concern was that education is a service, and ever since this legislation 's been in place, uh it has been uh uh uh legally possible for someone from an ethnic minority community to consider the possibility of bringing a school to court if they, they feel that they 're given uh  unfair or uh sort of disadvantageous treatment in the provision of an educational service Uhm I don't think it 's actually happened yet, I don't, I 'm not aware of any cases that it has happened But there  are examples of cases in the South, in the Republic of Ireland where in in a sort of an analogous area there have been a  a very large number of of cases in the uhm Travellers, Irish Travellers being excluded from pubs There 's an awful lot of publicans have been taken to court uh because they 've excluded Travellers, because this is a service uhm and uh there 's been quite a sort of uh heated discussion about that particular issue But anyway, in Northern Ireland uhm the uh in terms of uh the numbers of the ethnic minorities they are uh relatively small Uh in total the ethnic minorities constitute less than one percent of the of the uh of the population uh in Northern Ireland This is figures just taken from the two thousand and one census where, the total population is one thousand six hundred and seventy, nine hundred and forty-two whites Okay And and uh the total ethnic minority population, uh well one percent of that would be what Uh seventy-thousand, seventy-one thousand, uhm, and it 's considerably fewer uh in total number of ethnic minorities The largest is the Chinese community, there 's a little over four thousand Then, well the category 's called mixed, uh it 's I 'm not sure what what that means The uhm uh Irish Travellers, just over fifteen hundred, Indians about fifteen hundred and others and some of the  small groups <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> So two main, two main distinctive ethnic minority groups, Travellers and uh Chinese Okay but the numbers of ethnic minorities in total are uh are uh are quite small But nevertheless, because this is uh this is uh an issue, uhm the uh because of the race legislation and because of the greater awareness of the existence of the ethnic minorities, and also because of a greater awareness of the extent of uhm uh of uh racist harassment that uh that was taking place, uh the Commission for Racial Equality was established under this legislation as well although this was later subsumed into the Equality Commission Uh and the survey form that I got you to fill out was something that the Commission for Racial Equality asked us to do as a sort of a very quick uh data-gathering exercise just to try and see the extent to which uh uh teachers uh said they were aware of some issues in relation to uhm ethnic uh ethnic minorities If you just take sort of take a look at the questionnaire uh just to go through some of the items Uhm, first one, did you receive any information on ethnic minority communities in Northern Ireland a part of your initial teacher training Any anybody say yes to that Uh in the in the uh the uhm uh the survey we did, ninety-six percent said no That sort of fits with uhm sort of your experience Question two, have you had an opportunity to gain any information on ethnic minority communities in Northern Ireland as part of in-service training, Eighty-five percent said no Uh, would you like to have an opportunity to gain information on ethnic minority communities in Northern Ireland as part of the in-service provision How many said yes Yeah ah cos the, what we got was eighty-four percent saying yes to that Uh,  question four, do you feel schools should provide special support for children from ethnic minority families Should they provide support Yeah ninety-one percent said yes Should Northern Ireland pupils have more opportunity to learn about the cultures of ethnic minority communities in Northern Ireland Yeah Ninety-five percent said yes in that Do you feel schools should make special provision for children who may move school on a regular basis, for example Traveller children, Bit more mix there", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL",

sole trader is someone in business on his or her own account and who is self-employed They may or may not employ other people Sole trader route is often the most appropriate when the business is very small and not expected to grow much Setting up as a sole trader is perhaps the simplest way of entering into business From a legal point of view there is nothing you have to do to set up in business, and therefore there 's no costs really So the advantages are, obviously it 's easy to set up, no legal formalities and therefore no cost You have total control of the business Uhm you 're taxed as an individual Well, that 's not strictly true because you 're actually, you would take will take your drawings from the business every month or every week, and you 're actually taxed uhm at the end of the year so you don't operate PAYE, right the way most employed people do Uhm so what 'll happen is you will take your drawings every week or every month from the business and you don't pay tax on that But at the end of the year the business is taxed on its profitability and that profitability will include your drawings figure So it, you 're actually taxed then as a business, and taxed in a lump sum at the end of the year rather than throughout the year Alright do you understand Okay Uhm your accounts do not have to be is that right Shane just before I move on\n<$B>  Ah no that 's dead-on   Spot-on yeah \n<$A>  Yeah yeah   Thank-you  Just to keep me right there Uhm accounts do not have to be disclosed to the public therefore your business remains confidential The accounts of the business and, <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and the maintenance are not governed by legal regulations nor an annual audit required Therefore your accountant 's fees should be lower, which is true Uhm I mean my first year second year of trading I was a sole trader Last year we became a limited company And I 'm dreading the bill that we 're going to get this year compared to last year Uhm the business is easy to wind up So again folks you could get up some morning and think no, sole, I don't want to uhm be in business any more You can pull the plug relatively easily And again as a proprietor when you draw cash from the business there 's no need to operate PAYE Everybody 's familiar with the term PAYE Pay As You Earn Uhm although the Inland Revenue does catch up with you at a later date So it does pay to you know try and set money aside every month Losses from the business can be offset against other income and even used to reclaim PAYE paid in previous years So if all of you are in paid employment at the moment you go off you set up uh uhm as a sole trader you find your first year that you 've maybe made a slight loss in the business which you know it 's is perfectly fine uhm the chances are that you can actually reclaim tax that you have paid through previous employment You get a tax rebate, okay And again it 's a fairly easy procedure to turn the business into a limited company at a later date Uhm as I say we had to become a limited company because one of our customers had stipulated uhm as part of the  contract that we had to become a limited company Uhm, and it was quite easy I mean we got the accountant to sort it out But it is  very easy procedure to do Some of the disadvantages are that you 're totally responsible and liable for all business losses So if the business goes bankrupt so do you, uhm and your creditors will be entitled to seize your personal as well as your business possessions, which is very sad In effect you are the business Okay you will find on your chequebooks that it will be your name trading as your business name So you are the business in effect Transferring ownership of the business at any stage for example to family members may be more difficult than if they if this were a limited company And that 's simply because with a limited company you get shares allocated Okay so it 's everything is very much black and white Uhm and everybody knows where they stand whereas with uhm sole trader or partnership it 's all very grey You know it 's all sort of gentleman 's agreement and and whatever So sometimes it can become more difficult to introduce new partners or you know to  to hand over ownership to somebody else And again if you wish to expand your business it may be unwise to remain sole proprietor for long as this could inhibit, business growth Okay As well it can life can be lonely without a partner or fellow director And again income tax is payable on profits not on the amount withdrawn by the proprietor And this can be disadvantageous if profits are high enough to attract personal income tax at a higher rate Okay So that 's some of the advantages and the disadvantages, of uhm sole trader I 'm going to look at partnership, Partnership is legally the same as sole trader so as a partnership you actually operate the business the same as you would if you were a sole trader, except that two or more people are the proprietors instead of one A business partnership normally comprises between two and twenty people trading together as one firm and sharing in the profits And as well as sharing the profits each partner shares unlimited liability for all debts and obligations of the firm and is responsible for the liabilities of his fellow partner or partners as well as his own That 's the big thing folks With partnership  with partnerships uhm not only are you liable for your own business debt but also those of your partners , which is very scary And I I have seen it happen on several occasions where maybe partners have absconded They 've ran off and they 've left one person to carry all of the debt And that person would be responsible not for the debt that he 's in uhm incurred through the business but also the debt that the other partners have incurred through the business as well So it 's very very scary Uhm, although a partnership may, partnership may be entered into without any legal formalities the Partnership Act of nineteen-eighty will be taken to be the partnership agreement unless the partners draw up a separate deed It is advisable to have some kind of agreement drawn up by your accountant or a solicitor But the partnership agreement is there to protect you your friendship and your business It 's really important folks and I 'm sure Shane you would stress to the others that it is really really important to get a partnership agreement drawn up, that all of you know exactly where you stand And if something should happen and you know you decide to go your separate ways well at least you know your partnership agreement is there to protect you all, protect you and protect the business Alright so it is important It 's not that expensive I mean it 's less than two hundred pounds do you know to get a good partnership agreement drawn up Alright A definite must Uhm some of the advantages Again very similar to being a sole trader It 's a good way, first thing is  is that it 's a good way of pooling complementary skills obviously And I 'm sure all of you you know would agree that you complement each other in in some way Uhm it 's a good way of starting a business that requires more capital than you have at your disposal Uhm it can help share the workload and pressures associated with running a small business Partnerships may be formed quite easily although a comprehensive agreement is a must And again all of the advantages which relate to sole trader regarding accounts losses PAYE and alteration of legal form also apply to partnership Risks and liabilities are shared And again I suppose the obvious one there is that life is less lonely, in a partnership You know you 've got somebody there to bounce idea  off and and talk to  you 're laughing uhm and talk things through Some of the  disadvantages are that each partner is responsible for all business debts even those incurred by another partner There 's some legal costs involved in drawing up a partnership agreement although it 's not very much The profits have to be shared as well folks, which is always a downside Uhm there 's always the risk of a personality clash and incompatibility Uhm and it says here business partners should be chosen as seriously as marriage ones And uhm certainly again I 've seen it folks You know I have seen it with my own eyes where business partnerships have gone awry you know usually within the first year uhm where you know with the best will in the world three people or two people set out you know with the same idea and very very quickly you know they sort of realise well maybe one partner 's not pulling their weight or you know that they have very different visions for the business Uhm, and it 's really important that you sit down you know and talk things through uhm right from the beginning you know and realise what the implications are you know that that doesn't happen  Excuse me The death or bankruptcy of any one partner unless there 're other  arrangements to the contrary will automatically dissolve the partnership So again another good reason why you would actually have a partnership agreement in place It can be difficult to expand the business by introducing new partners, and problems that relate to sole trader uhm to transferring ownership and income tax being payable on profits also apply to partnerships Lenders prefer limited company structure to cover risk, sometimes not necessarily Uhm there 's also folks there a limited liability partnership I don't know Shane if you know if this is in existence in Northern Ireland or if you 've heard of\n<$B> We don't see <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> have liability partnerships now\n<$A> Do they\n<$B> Yeah   Yes  basically after all the <unclear> several sylls </unclear> American firms <unclear> several sylls </unclear> now, while there 's still partnership <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A>  Yeah  \n<$A> Yeah I mean it is good in that a limited  I wasn't sure whether it had come to Northern Ireland yet or not I know there was some people said it had and some people you know weren't quite sure Uhm but certainly limited liability will give you the protection in that it limits your liability towards the  what uhm with the responsibility of your partners Okay But you you still have the benefits of trading as uhm a a partnership Okay so it might be again something that you maybe think about going down the road of getting a limited uhm limited liability partnership rather than just an ordinary partnership Okay There 's a couple of web addresses there as well at the bottom if you want to to investigate further And the final one is limited company, The main point which distinguishes a limited company from other forms of business is that it is regarded as a separate legal entity from the people who own and run it It is treated as if it were a separate person So once once my company became limited uhm I was no longer the business in effect It was no longer Jan Todd trading as IMS on the chequebook Uhm the company was formed and I then became an employee of that that company 's okay albeit a director but I was then became an employee", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "60a3f8a6-8afa-4bd9-9223-e18e18219774", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.342061+00:00"}
{"text": "<Investment Finance>\n\n\n<$A> It 's very simple You 're buying in products that have a recommended retail price on it You just put your, your goods or your services out at that rate However, it 's not usually as straightforward as that Okay the first one we 're going to look at in any detail uhm is the cost plus pricing method alright It 's very popular because it 's very simple one to use What it actually does is if you know your hourly cost, or your product cost you can add a markup Okay In this case uhm we have on the board it 's a twenty percent markup So what would happen if you worked out your hourly cost was fifteen pounds You decide well if I 'm going to mark everything up by twenty percent to give me profit, alright It would make then your price per hour eighteen pounds And what you do is every time you charge yourself out you bill yourself eighteen pounds Okay so it 's your cost plus a markup And if there 's any direct costs or raw material you need to add those in as well Okay So that 's your hourly cost, multiply it up by your markup and then add on any raw materials, or extras that you 're charging   so \n<$X>  So that way   you 're only making only three pound an hour then\n<$A> No no What it means see in this here You 've covered all your drawings, what you need to live on right You 've covered all your costs your overheads, your depreciation, and actually then you 're putting on a wee bit extra to make a profit Okay Again it can be up to you It could be a twenty percent markup forty percent markup a hundred percent markup, Okay Uh if you know your competitors are charging like thirty pounds an hour and your costs 're only ten you are not going to do a ten percent markup You know you want to get it up there so you might be uh able, to markup two hundred percent Okay But it 's a very straightforward method You decide on your markup and you just go through and add it on Okay Nobody manufacturing sure there 's not No Again it 's just you work up, get a cost for a product and add on your markup and get a selling price It 's very straightforward Uhm we 've a case here fifty percent markup 's being added So if your cost is six pounds fifty percent markup that 's another three pounds, your final goods 'll be sold for nine pounds Okay If you 're going to go with cost plus pricing there 's a few wee dangers that you need to watch out for, okay It doesn't take into account market factors such as demand and what customers will pay, okay So say uhm I was costing fifty pounds an hour, and I decide well I 'm going to put a hundred a hundred percent markup I 'm going to charge a hundred pounds an hour Maybe nobody 'll pay that Okay I need to look at at just what 's out there and what they will pay and what the going rates are in the industry It also ignores positioning and image, okay All I can say you know designer jeans, probably cost not a lot more to make than normal jeans but because there 's the you know the imaging you can put a huge markup on that, okay If you 're just going through your products with twenty percent markup you 'll miss the potential in there Uhm sometimes costs like depreciation you forget You know the tendency to do is you buy a product in and it 's ten pounds and you think och I 'll just shove a markup on that, you know twenty percent But you 've forgotten you 've overheads and you 've depreciation to account for Okay There 's also lost sales if the pricing 's too high and then lost income if the pricing 's too low Alright So just be aware if you 're going to use that very straightforward method but there 's a number of dangers\n<$X> Uhm Jan was saying about setting your price about you know where once you 've set that uhm customers who <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> come to the work they expect to maintain that price   from there  on in\n<$A>  Mhm  \n<$A> Mhm cos you 're setting a precedent   If  you put your prices up they might think hey hold on I 'm being taken advantage of here Yeah you need to be very wary just initially\n<$X>  Yeah  \n<$X> Mhm\n<$A> When you make a decision about your price you know\n<$X> Mm yeah,\n<$A> Uhm the second one we 're going to look at is market-led pricing, alright And it focuses on customers ' needs and wants uhm customer perceptions of your value or product So that if you sell yourself as I 'm really good I 'm unique I can do all this they may be prepared to pay a bit more Okay if you know that, you can set your price accordingly Okay Uhm market demand trends, say you have entered the sunbed industry and you 're the only one in the area, you put your price Suddenly but loads of people come in, you 're not competitive any more You may need to lower your price So you need to look at the market and the demands in it, and also competitors ' prices Uhm talking about the seaweed bath, say you decide to charge twenty pounds an hour, competitors open next door and they 're charging fifteen you might need to rethink your whole, pricing strategy, okay So the market-led pricing is looking at factors within the marketplace, and deciding on those And this is a a pretty common one it 's differential pricing alright And in this what happens is different margins or markups are used for different products or services Okay A typical example would be say the airline industry Say if I went uhm to book a flight to Manchester tonight I go on the website I can maybe get certain prices But if I go on in a week 's time the prices could be completely different, okay What happens usually in differential pricing you 'd maybe give discounts to bigger customers, or you might set a low price initially to get some work, or you might say uhm, I think this has potential in it I 'm prepared to do a bit of, extra for you, and set you know sort of differential pricing depending on the customer or the job or even the timescale Okay Somebody needs a job done in a hurry you might put your prices up because you know that they 're going to pay extra Okay So what happens then there 's no one set price in differential pricing Different prices for different products for different people different times Okay That would probably apply to you wouldn't it\n<$X> Mhm\n<$A> If you think somebody could afford a wee bit more you might    decide \n<$X>  If he was   a millionaire or something \n<$A> There was one guy came in and he was living uhm said he lived up Malone Road And he said you 'd get a  a quote on the phone and then they 'd find out where you lived, and the price would suddenly go up a bit  He says so I learn never to tell them where I live til I got a price from them What probably happens in reality is it 's a bit of a mixture of all of those things What you tend to do is you add on a bit of a markup You see whether you could get away with a bit more Alright And then when it actually comes to it some customers you might give a discount to, or you might charge a bit more depending who they are Okay So it 's probably a mixture of all three to a certain extent Okay Again it 's up to yourself which type of pricing policy you use And as Jan said it 's very important especially when you 're starting off to get the right price for yourself Okay Do you want to spend five minutes actually thinking now what price you 're going to set for your business whether it 's per hour or per job, or per day, or per session Okay Just use one of those techniques if you can As I say usually most people would use some sort of mixture of them all\n\n<$A> Uhm last thing we 're going to do in this section is a thing called break-even analysis alright Uhm, and what it is it 's trying to work out the point in your business where you neither make a profit, or or a loss where you actually break even so that your revenue equals your costs Okay You need to know this because sometimes what can happen it can take a few months for the business to actually break even So you can be running at a  uh a loss for a few months, and then you make your profit Okay If you know when you 're going to break even then it can help you plan financially But sometimes if you 're going to make a loss for a few months you 're going to need extra funding You know you might need to go to your bank manager and say look uhm here 's my forecast I 'm making a loss for three months but I should by month four have turned that around and I should be moving into profit Okay So you 'll actually need to know at what point in your business you 're going to break even Okay so your costs are going to cover, or 're being covered exactly by your income And all of you who love formulas, here 's the best one yet The break-even point is where your total costs, and what is actually here is overheads that we looked at earlier right you depreciation that we looked at earlier plus your drawings, uhm, divided through by your sales price per unit, less any direct <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> equals, your break-even sales I know it sounds a bit complicated but what they 're saying here say you 're selling price per unit is, what nine pounds and the raw material for that is a pound, so your total cost here so your depreciation and your overheads plus your drawings, divide that through then by, eight and you get one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five units So what we 're saying is if we do one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five units we 're going to cover all our overheads our depreciation, and our drawings Okay At that point you will neither make a loss or a profit It 'll just exactly cover costs Okay And that is what 's called the break-even point Uhm a lot of people get a bit hung up on it cos it looks a bit scary But it 's it 's basically it 's very simple What we 're saying is say that product cost us nine or we were selling the product at nine pounds, we 've bought it in at a pound, there 's a difference there of eight pounds profit we 're making on on that one product Okay So there 's like an eight pounds contribution per product towards covering all our overheads So how many of these do we need to sell to cover all our overheads And that 's all it 's doing Okay It 's working out how many units, at that price will cover all our costs Alright So for the like uhm your jobs you might work out, I need to do twenty jobs a year to cover all my overheads and my drawings Okay Maybe you might need to sell two thousand units if you 're  to cover all your costs Okay but you do need to know at what point your break-even sales are", "subdomain":

{"text": "<Biochemistry talk>\n\n\n<$A> I think the initial reactions, can be summed up, in one or two, words, absolute total shock It was bad enough when we discovered that we were allocated into, groups you know <unclear> two words </unclear> But when we discovered that the experimental section was lacking a method, well we seriously began to weigh up our options I think our first option must 've been, leave the country, but due to student, grants this didn't seem feasible But not to despair we had another option, change degree course  But unfortunately, due to university policy the only, alternative degree course was Mongolian Basket Weaving So, after all that we decided we 'd give it a go, So the first stage was getting organised into teams, and this was actually quite difficult The course consisted of a hundred and thirty students, so trying to find other team members proved, quite a hassle And at one stage the lecturer actually had to come to the front, and call the group members up and say now look these are your group members And the rest of that day was basically just getting acquainted with the other group members So on to the, planning stage Well the group members came along all with their individual ideas and these were pooled and a common, approach to the problem, was drawn up And I think at this stage it became apparent that leaders were beginning to emerge, either naturally or, by election And how each group, decided to carry out their work, uh, was a personal thing Some groups decided that, all the members would participate in all aspects, and other groups decided that, two students would maybe carry out experimental work and two would do research round the area So the next stage was to put the plan into action And before any experimental work could begin each group had to consult a designated lecturer And this was basically just to ensure that each group was headed in the right direction And I must point out at this stage that the first consultation, was free but subsequent ones had to be paid for so this incorporated a financial aspect, as well And we had approximately two weeks in which to carry out th' experiment So at the end of the, two-week period each group got their results, and cost and analysed them, to see if anybody had developed an economically feasible method But I don't think we 'll go into this area in too much detail , And the exams were imminent at this stage so it was all but forgotten about over the exam period But th' exams came and went and, presentation day was looming And I think panic set in at this stage And believe me you 've never seen so many students in so short a time learn how to use a computer It was  just absolute chaos And, personally speaking our group, at ten o'clock the night before the presentation, were waiting for the conclusions to come out of, out of the printer and if we thought we were cutting it fine, well the computer room the next morning was a different story But somehow all the students managed to get their posters in place and up for the stipulated time And I think this was the first time we could actually sit back and breathe a sigh of relief The pressure was off and the panic was over And this was the first chance that we had to meet any prospective employers And, I think they did have quite a lot of influence on, the effort that students did put into their work I somehow didn't feel if it had been just for the lecturers, we we would 've put in as much work And John must 've had a very hard, job judging the posters because everybody did work extremely hard, and put in, a lot of effort And also I think too it was it was a new project, for us as much as it was for the lecturers And I think they had a marvellous job in their organisation skills And all in all I think it was a great success And I 'd like now to hand you over to Cameron, and he 's going to give you an insight into some <unclear> several words </unclear>\n\n\n<$B> Thank-you Uhm  Phil 's just given you something of an insight into what the students actually experienced during the project And I 'd furthermore like to go to tell you what I felt that or what they rather felt they gained from the project Uh it 's true that the two weeks of the actual project itself were quite demanding, and a great deal of effort was required by everybody who took part And from day one everybody really had to knuckle down and just get on with doing the project There was no simple way around it However, I would like to say, it wasn't two weeks spent for nothing The project was designed in such a way as to give students a sense of vocational training, and to give them some, real-life experience and what it 'd be like to be in industry working in lab conditions and having time constraints on you and to worry about money management, and various other aspects of, life in industry And inevitably this kind of project work does have many benefits to it The type of project work we were doing, was extensive and it developed many skills I think many people never even realised they had The first one was probably communication On day one you arrived and you were in your randomly allocated groups You didn't pick your friends and just go and work with them all day You were given people, many people you never even met before And you had to sit down and get to know them there and then and it forced you to communicate There was no way around the problem You had to work with these people for two weeks and you just had to talk to them Uhm after the initial introductions, you had to get on with it And this meant that for the first time there had to be a sense of group organisation, and perhaps more importantly management if anything successful was going to come out of your work Obviously we don't live in a perfect world and arguments and personality clashes do and did arise in the project However it meant that people were forced into, developing diplomacy and tolerance Invariably projects, if they were going to succeed, required initiative This was not your conventional standard spoon-fed practical you 'll find in most lab classes People had to sit down and think how they were going to go about it They were given the bare bones of a project, an outline of what was expected and the results that they were hoped that they would achieve However they had to work out for themselves how they were going to get those results Then, furthermore, for anything to work you were going to have to assign tasks to various people There were time constraints on you something which you don't often have, the opportunity to experience certainly, in standard lab work And people had to sit and think about how to efficiently use their time in the lab sessions They also had to assign tasks to various members and this required a certain degree of diplomatic delegation Trying to tell people who didn't want to do a job that they were best suited for it and needed to do it And this meant that another important factor came into it in the form of teamwork We all had to work as a team to get results The actual project work itself did augment your basic practical skills But it went a bit further than that because it also required a greater standard of presentation than we normally require You had to present it as a poster something we never had to do before You had to think about what you 're going to put in it And for the first time in a practical class anyway, you had to think about the creativity, the artistic side of it You had to have something that was going to catch people 's eyes and make a good impression For many people this meant conquering one of their greatest fears, that of using computers Now even in science there are many technophobes and many people had to frantically learn how to use the computer at short notice And I think if you look at the posters, you 'll agree with me that many people did make a very good job of it Uhm, but perhaps some of the best aspects of it were actually learning to cope with stress, the ongoing work of it, seeing how to link up small, interrelated practicals rather than having each this little individual bits and not seeing how they all connect in a linear fashion And at the end of the day to get results from it, and perhaps more importantly to be able to assess the value of everybody in the group and see how they played a role, to look at it and to critically assess not only your own role but their role and their contribution to the groups, something which would be very important in industry we felt, in terms of assessing the effectiveness of your workforce Uhm, it was something many people never done before and I think it was a challenge They also had to take into consideration money Knowing a lot of you never have to face this problem and, you can be a bit careless about what you 're doing But when you 're suddenly faced with having to pay the bills for it you do tend to become a lot more efficient with what you 're doing Uhm the pipettes don't get broken so easily, the beakers don't get hurled about for example Not that they do normally of course  Uhm, however uh there were some people at the end of the day were sitting trying to figure out if they could give themselves a tidy Christmas bonus at the end of it all but I don't think many people could 've managed that But perhaps the greatest gift of all from the enterprise project and I would consider it a gift was actually the sense of self-confidence that developed at the end of the day People were, in a situation where they had to communicate with one another They had to communicate with people of quite, high importance to employers people from industry people they would never have normally talked to And they had to be, fluent and eloquent and they had to  they had to bring across what they were doing and how they 'd achieved it and they had to put across in such a way as everybody could understand them, Uhm, and not only that they also had to 've the confidence to work in the lab, to be effective, and to get on with it And at the end of the day I think everyone would agree with me that, it certainly gave you confidence to achieve your own ability to its best potential And at that point I 'd just like to say if anybody 's any questions on the project Lynn and I will do our best to answer them, Thank-you", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "32a4c7dd-af3c-40ca-80c7-ead005b043c2", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.343825+00:00"}
{"text": "<Placement students>\n\n\n<$A> That 's fine Thanks very much indeed, My name 's Peter Shaw and I 'm Chief Internal Auditor of the Eastern Health and Social Services Board Uh as of the first of July last year uh we joined a new unit known as the Provider Support Unit And the   Provider Support Unit appears to have the same relationship with the Eastern Board as Enterprise appears to have with Queen 's Uh they pay us but they don't necessarily control us Now over the years uh we have had a number of placement students within uh the Board, and we have uhm processed them uh through the Internal Audit Unit, with, not very much success So therefore when I got a phonecall from Bronagh, uh to, take on a couple of placement students my attitude was quite simply, how do I get out of this, but politely I have a teaching contract with Queen 's and I didn't really want to jeopardise that much And I had an awful feeling that in actual fact the two might be linked together in some way However, as I said our experiences with uh placement students have been particularly bad in the past And some of the problems can be summarised as follows We, the Board tend to take graduate trainees and put them through uh a circular programme lasting about two or three years, and they visited a large number of departments and our department was one of them So quite simply the problems that we found was this First of all it was always a compulsory placement for them And secondly, they had a very very poor image of Internal Audit Now I 've yet to meet anybody or any youngster fourteen or fifteen years of age who turned round and said to me yeah I want to be an Internal Auditor I really want to be an Internal Auditor  So you 've got an image problem right from day one  thirdly the placements didn't like the nature of the work that we did Uh we uh the work that they were going to do in actual fact was going to be very much ticking and totting, and verifying work and they  uninteresting and boring And they were unwilling, they were unable to take responsibility and the range of work that we were able to give them was somewhat limited And they were only in for three months so that in fact was far far too short a timescale, for us to do anything So my initial reaction was when Bronagh got in contact with me was to get out of it However, a number of things happened At the beginning of April last year we took control of our own budget, and uh as our friends in Biochemistry said the money does count And we started looking at  at things in terms of cost uh you begin to refocus your objectives somewhat more sharply And we sat down and we thought about this And first of all, these students were coming in for twelve months with a possible building on the extension of the three months And I think the grant situation now almost ensures that you have the group for three months So, they were going to be viable They were going to be viable first of all in terms of skills In other words we could teach them to do something, and, we were going to get some payback for it And, secondly the time spent up there, they were going to be very cost-effective Now this in fact negated a lot of the problems that we had before So therefore we thought now in terms that this would be a very very good thing to do But if it was going to be a very very good thing to do from our point of view we had to do a lot of thinking about it And the thinking that we did can be summarised\n\n<$A> Cos this was the sort of marketplace that we were in We then, did a very careful briefing to all of those who were interested We brought them down, and we told them what the job was all about We described to them very carefully and we took a lot of time to do it, what were the roles and function of Internal Audit We got a nice glossy glossy brochure made up, which in actual fact we needed anyway and we gave them that as well And thirdly, we had, our main emphasis on the actual skills that the candidates would attain during their twelve months or fifteen months with us So at the end of the day, we were, quite well assured that they were never going to end up as career Internal Auditors Very few people do end up as career Internal Auditors very few of us around You don't want too many of us around anyway but there are very few of us around Anyway so what sort of skills were they going to gain What in fact were they going to get out of it Well first of all obviously there was going to be personal skills Time management was one This has already been brought up by the Biochemistry people that time means everything We sell time So time management was going to be one thing we were going to get Uh there was going to be an opportunity of uh quite simply learning organisational skills, uh learning personal administration skills, uh the would  the opportunity ultimately if they prove themselves for leadership skills even, and all of these uh were, pointed out to them that this was what in fact was in it for them and what in fact they would get out of it at the  uh uh if in fact they want to come towards us Now after all of that, we, then, attracted six people along for a final interview And we set up the interview in the normal way in which any public body sets up an interview We had uh no option Uh we 've got to move with the Fair Employment Commission and we 've also to move with the Equal Opportunities people as well And, we have got to organise ourselves, and run, interviews which in fact can be seen to be uhm properly-run interviews and all the rest of it We 'd to do this and we 'd to do this as well And we thought in fact that this was a very good idea because this would be another good learning exercise for the students as well They could come along and they would be on an interview panel Uh or they would see in fact how an interview panel operated And we invited Bronagh to be present on that interview panel so that, she could feed back to students at the end of the day what in actual fact had happened to them where their good points were where their poor points were where what in fact they were going to have to bring out in future, uhm selections So, we had the interview board and we had a representation from the university, and then finally we made our selection And we selected two ladies, uh who joined us on the first of, July last year and who are still with us at the moment And to be quite honest with you we were, or we in fact have been extremely, uh happy with the students that we 've got I think, in summary, the whole thing can be, almost summarised quite simply as follows That first of all so far as we have been concerned, that the whole exercise has been firstly, cost-effective, cost-efficient Secondly there must be something in it from both parties Now the students coming in uh, were coming in to do a specific job They were an integral part of our department They weren't supernumaries in any way They were coming in to do a specific job If we hadn't taken these students on, we would 've had to take on permanent staff to cover And because of the fact that we were able to take the students on it worked well or things worked well for both parties So therefore the placements must have a real job in the organisation, and they must see in actual fact what both parties are getting out of it In other words they must be happy enough to realise that quite possibly we 're going to make a profit out of it And I tell them uh both girls when they, every time I see them, uh you 're letting me go up to Queen 's this morning and you 're working your way you 're beavering away here quite happily uh so that I can go up to Queen 's and spout about this And I can do this because in actual fact you 've made uh you have made it possible Uh, so therefore from our point of view it has worked out particularly well One point that I didn't emphasise earlier on was in actual fact training that we gave the students before they came in and joined us We decided that if we 're going to select them and go to so much trouble to select them we were going to have to properly train them as well So we had a two-day induction course and a formal two-day induction course of debt training, to explain to them in theory what we did, how we organised files, how we organised our work how the work was carried out So they had an idea then of the theory of what we did The second thing we did then was on the job training We assigned them, to specific members of staff who would take them out on various audit engagements and quite simply show them the ropes, and that was melded in with their theoretical two-day training Our ambitions were that, the students would begin to take charge of their own engagements around about Christmas or the beginning of the New Year That in fact once they got enough experience out on various jobs they might begin to take charge of their own jobs and want to take charge of their own jobs When they joined us it became very apparent very quickly that in actual fact they wanted to take charge a lot sooner And they were very much capable of taking charge So instead of Christmas we were, giving them the opportunity to take charge of their own engagements from September onwards Now quite honestly they weren't that complex engagements they looked fairly straightforward, in order to build up their confidence, to let them see that in actual fact they were doing a good job and that they were achieving something, and that they could attend to their own audit meetings and take charge of their audit meetings and quite simply begin to manage the whole operation of an audit And we have not been disappointed And quite simply, the more responsibility they want to take the more responsibility we can give them cos quite simply they can just go on to more and more complex jobs And we found out as I say very quickly we were able to do this And they graduated to that much more quickly uh than in fact we had anticipated So much so I am very anxious to get back to uh Bronagh this year and ask for two more placement students And in fact we 've recruited two more placement students", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b09a0c6c-7b08-4273-926c-4703ee82f336", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.344669+00:00"}
{"text": "<Food - Simon talks>\n\n\n<$A> We as a company have employed, placement students over the past few years that we have been open We have employed two different types of placement students, ones in short-term placement for three months basically summer vacation work, and ones on the longer-term year And we have been looking probably for different things out of the two sets of students Out of the three-month placement students, normally these people are placed to cover  holidays on the floor And basically are put down, to work on the production lines to cover jobs like packing jobs or whatever else Fairly unskilled but, the thing that we get from students when we take them into that job, is that the people actually have an understanding of the processes that are going on within the food industry The reasons behind the various hygiene practice rules that we have within the food industry And so we 're taking on people who are not, completely ignorant They have to be, trained to quite a degree We can slot them in and they uhm because they have that understanding they can work in in along with everybody else fairly easily And we have found that quite successful through the summer Now we have taken on other students three in total, for a placement of a year, one from Queen 's and two from <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> who run the food uhm course Again all our students have come from the food side They 're very aware of, basically everything that 's behind food They 're aware of the microbiological implications the chemical  implications and applications, that are going on on in the factory And so, there 's an awful lot less training involved and actually getting then up them up to the level that we require to get useful work out of them What we have found with our year students, is that, a lot a lot of effort, on the part of management has to be put in to make sure that they 're aware of everything that is going on It 's only when you bring somebody in and start to try to teach them to be able to take on the project that you realise all the complications and implications that go with the particular work And in a way it 's very useful for  management, to have to relearn, the processes that they have, evolved themselves because that makes us look at all the little problems, and uhm iron them out as we go along So there 's a lot of, there 's a lot of input that has to be put into the student, if  in order for them to be able to take off and start to produce useful work, for us But certainly with the students that we have had we have found that uhm, they have initiative, they 're able to do projects on their own as long as they are fairly well-controlled, they have the energy and the enthusiasm to do that because they themselves are trying to gain something out of that year Out of their year out they are trying to gain uhm you know a  a look into industry Can they work in industry In our case it 's always been yes But can can they can they work to the targets that people set, uhm and can people be pleased with their work Because obviously, we 're the people that they 're going to use as referees in years to come, and they want they want us to be able to say yes This person did very good work for us We think they have great potential in the future And so I think that 's what the student gains But certainly, uhm from an employer 's point of view we gain a lot of useful work, uhm which, uh it and it  there is quite an input that has to be put in from the  the managerial point of view because if a student is left on their own to work uhm, they have no idea where the company, is wanting to aim with that work They have no idea of the  financial implications unless that is all brought over to the student And so certainly there has to be, quite a a large managerial input But then if that is put in certainly an awful lot of very useful work comes out on the other side And certainly the students that we have found <unclear> 4 words </unclear> to be very indispensable\n\n\n<$B> I 'm delighted to be here and the fact that I, had to cancel a meeting in New York  and uh was rushed down here Uh the liaison we 've had with the Science Shop has been going on for about, maybe three years And when I first, I came to the Simon Community, I was met with a as usual in the voluntary sector an amazing, workload but very few personnel to carry it out Uhm, our system 's newly built along uhm east coast with which have one-year contracts Uh they 're very limited at the moment I 'm actually getting a cut in a lot of, a lot of organisations So, uhm, I was looking for areas where I could liaise honestly with the universities Not just the fact that I could get someone to do research but I could also go to the university and give them something in return, which is maybe turning up at certain uh places like this giving a an insight into what we 've give the students or doing lectures in the social work department or, housing studies et-cetera et-cetera So our initial aim was to give a two-way, type of uh relationship, the fact that we were not just taking on the students and using them to do a piece of research and then saying thanks very much, uhm, that 's wonderful All the best What we initially thought is, it would have to be two-way so that the  the student has a the conviction and commitment to finish a piece of research Luckily enough in ninety percent, ninety-five percent of the cases that we have taken in over the last three years, the research has been excellent And at the moment we 're preparing to  publish round about three or four, uh important pieces of research, uh which I will go on and explain For those that obviously don't know what the Simon Community does hopefully youse do or,  again that 's my own problem Uhm, our main aim is to provide accommodation, for single homeless people in Northern Ireland Now it 's quite a large task cos there is twenty thousand, people who have a homeless difficulty each year in Northern Ireland And, the area that we mainly concentrate on or the age group is those between seventeen and sixty-four so it is quite  quite a large age group but we do uh limit it down to the fact that you must be single, as that 's the age group which does not get uh priority in about eighty-five ninety percent of the cases, with Northern Ireland Housing Executive So, with that type of demand for our services, we have to think of ways, of meeting that Now we 've are two main aims One is, a provision aim, to set up emergency accommodation projects, to meet the needs of individuals who are homeless Our other aim 's to campaign, to effect, change within government bodies, people like Mr Shaw Thatcher 's bodies et-cetera to look at the needs of homeless people and, do something about it, or even understand the pressure that we 're under So there 's ways that we we do this And one of the most important ways, is to put forward campaigns which all have to be based in very relevant time like and extremely, detailed research And, the research is that important that, a lot of our  opposition will come back and say well that point was wrong We can't afford that to happen, We have to   present very credible, uh research papers And the thing is, when I initially was approached by students and I was thinking God will they will they turn up in the morning to do this piece of research I 've got an interview organised with, the director of such and such Cos if they turn up after a night in the Crescent or Lavery 's, what am I going to do You know, will this really work for me So it was a it was a learning, process to begin with and hopefully we sorted all that out And that was due to the fact that I was liaising, with uh Ms Farrell from the the Science Shop and, we 've struck up a great relationship with Maura Murphy in the Law Faculty and it 's mainly those pieces of research, uh that we use at the moment and I 'll go on to explain Now the provision, for us to provide that given a piece of uh given accommodation project in an area, we need to find out what 's the level of need in that area uh what type of age group it is, uh what regions are people homeless in this and that area what 's the population in that area et-cetera et-cetera And to find out if there was a a specific need So that means that the research can back up our provision end It also then has important implications for, our campaign end As a <unclear> 1 word </unclear> any given campaign you need to back it up again, with the research And at the moment uhm I 've just got an example of some of the research we have Uh round about the end of this month it 's uh Housing Executive 's uh anniversary This, this is the year anniversary of taking over responsibility for homelessness And two and a half years ago we produced a publication called Home Truths Now this was produced internally by our own researcher Now the fifth, the the second edition analysed in five years is now going to be produced by, someone from the Science Shop Now they 've already got the stats, and all the recommendations on it for the last four years so the guy is actually employed at the minute somewhere else but he 's still working with us, so that in April he comes along for maybe, four or five nights a week uh to finish this publication off Now the importance of this is it is the  authoritarian, uh, analysis of homelessness in Northern Ireland And without, the liaison with the Science Shop we wouldn't 've got this produced Uhm, obviously, the what the student needs out of this is on the day hopefully the it 'll probably be launched in here, uh in the Canada Room Uh, it and the last time we launched it it had TV coverage, Inside Ulster, uh  UTV Live and the person who did the  research was interviewed That 's important for their career and important for their, their own standing in the community and even, most importantly for their confidence that they 've done a piece of research, which from our point of view will 've some input, into changing, either legislation or changing attitudes or even informing individuals like yourself of the problems of homelessness Another piece of research which was  mentioned at the very beginning, of the, the morning was the award-winning piece of research by, the Law Faculty, and one part of it was for the Simon Community It was entitled uh The Social Fund, A Lottery for the Homeless That piece of research at the moment is with the our design team and we 're just ready to finish off, and design it It 'll be launched round about, well this is is another <unclear> two words </unclear> here round about June nineteen ninety-four Uh hopefully that will be the date we launch it but again,  these type of reports would not have come about, without the co-operation, of the Science Shop without this type of enterprise And for the voluntary sector it 's it 's extremely important to get, uh committed individuals to work for us cos as which has been seen throughout all the presentations, there 's this one aspect of money And uh, like other organisations and like other sectors we are, extremely, strapped for cash and we need to use, or not use but co-operate and uh work with every, every type of organisation to make sure at the end of the day we get our goals met without, uh expending a lot of money", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "24463ee0-2bb2-4157-8f9c-346d306298c8", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.345555+00:00"}
{"text": "<Investment NI>\n\n\n<$A> Uhm we 've had people in who have uhm products which are in very early stages of development and it 's going to be like three years before they 'll break even you know because their capital costs were so high initially So they need to know that before they get funding and organise with their bank a huge overdraft Okay If they weren't able to show like a break-even point they wouldn't be able to get any funding anywhere People 'll just say och don't be silly You 're making a loss, you know But they could show you know with the projected sales income and guaranteed sales in the future actually it would turn into a profit Okay And also for yourselves I mean if you 're making a loss, by the end of month three or month four it might be very demoralizing But if you 've worked out your break-even point as month five even you know it 's alright I expect this In another month 's time I 'll 've covered all my costs and I 'll actually be in profit Okay Has everybody got the principle of break even Okay So guess what you 're going to do now Have a go at trying to find your break-even point Okay If you 're charging uhm an hourly rate what you would do in here would be the hourly uhm hourly rate you 're charging Okay so if it 's fifteen pounds an hour, you work out how many hours you have to do to cover all your overheads Okay If you 're charging per day you just put your daily figure in there and work out how many days you have to do, to cover all your costs Okay Say total cost there it 's just again, overheads plus the uh depreciation, and your drawings then you know That 's it okay It 's almost the same as that calculation you did a bit a  while ago working out the cost But now it 's about price\n\n<$A> Flow forecasting, profit loss account, how to forecast your sales and then we 'll be doing our own profit and loss our own cash flow Alright I 'm just finishing off by looking at a few issues Okay All those costs that you 've looked at last night and tonight uhm we can use these costs, in our cash flow and in our profit and loss accounts Okay We 'll also have to get our sales projections, but once we 've got that we can pull together our, financial projections Has anybody uh done a cash flow before Yes Okay So a few people have A cash flow forecast all it is is basically a prediction of what 's going to be flowing into and out of the business okay on a cash basis, right So maybe you usually do it from the year or for a year in advance And it 's just what 's coming into and out of the business, month to month or week to week Okay what cash is coming in what cash is going out Profit and loss account I 'm sure everybody 's heard of, slightly different and what it does it summarizes the income and expenditure for a period and it shows you either the profit or the loss you 've made during that period Okay Cash flow 's just the cash Profit actually shows uh profit and loss account actually shows you the profit or the loss you 've made The balance sheet uhm, everybody found the balance sheet What it is it 's just the finance financial snapshot okay of the business at any given time It shows the assets and the liabilities for the business Okay So it shows you like what 's your bank balance what what value are the assets, okay who owns the business as in how much capital there is in it Okay We won't be doing a balance sheet in this course cos it 's a wee bit more than you need okay but we will be looking at the cash flow and the profit and loss account Okay so cash flow forecast it 's probably the main uh thing we 'll be spending time on tonight okay Uhm as we 've said before it 's just a forecast of money coming into and out of the business Okay What happens you try and look ahead usually the next twelve months, and try to estimate or forecast what 's going to happen Okay We 'll go from month to month We 'll look at our sales We 'll reckon what 're going to be our costs and when are they actually paid out and what 'll happen to our cash Okay Now why would you want to do a cash flow forecast okay cos a lot of people just want to know about their profit, so why bother about a cash flow Well it identifies projected bank balances for a start So it means say uhm you were all looking at your break-even there, say if you 're going to break even in month six, you might have a deficit for each month up to then Okay But you 'll only know that if you 've done your cash flow and you 've put your figures in and your costs in Okay So it means you can go to the bank and say, I 'm going to have an  or I 'm going to be in the red for a few months, but I 've done my cash flow forecasts and look after month six, uh that should be in the black again It indicates funding requirements Okay If you can do your forecast and uh you can see what you need when If you 're going to have a big deficit in month one and month two you might need to go and borrow some money, or you might need to get a friend to lend you some or you might need to put off buying some capital equipment til you 've more money in It facilitates financial planning Okay So say uhm a few people say well, I 'm going to really reduce my drawings for the first few months, but if you 've a good cash flow forecast you can say but by month three month four I 'm going to be able to up that because I should have enough money in So you can do a bit of planning on it It indicates indicates viability or break-even Remember that exercise that we 've just done That will actually show up in your cash flow whenever your costs equal your revenue And it should show, you can just be able to look it up and where it 's the same that 'll indicate the break-even point The other thing is it is a requirement of most funders So if you want to apply for the grant they will actually ask you for a cash flow forecast so that they can see if your business is going to be financially viable or not, right If you 're going to the bank as well uhm if you 're just starting off a lot of times you don't have a balance sheet and you don't have a profit and loss account, cos you haven't been in business so they 'll ask you for a cash flow forecast Okay So it 's a good thing to do and it 's a good thing to know how to do it Okay so what about a cash flow Uhm, I put one on everybody 's desks Do you all get it Now this is uhm a typical one from somebody who 's come through the business start programme I 've amended a few figures but this is pretty typical Okay So  what do you do Uhm basically what we 're doing is we 're looking at the total income taking off the total expenditure and we 're going to get a net cash flow every month Okay So it 's just all the money coming in less all the money going out that 's going to give us a net cash flow Okay we do that on a monthly basis And what happens the opening balance right at the start of business will be nothing You assume you have nothing It 's a new business And your closing balance will be the net cash flow, for that month, less the opening balance add on the opening balance Okay The closing balance this month is going to be the opening balance to the next okay And we 'll add on the cash flow you know if there 's positive or deduct it if it 's negative and get a closing balance for the next month Okay All will be revealed What we 'll do is we 'll go through this and we 'll explain just what everything is okay Uhm, let me see, we 'll start by looking at the, see if you look on down it 's called the capital income Sometimes it 's called capital income and sometimes it 's called funding okay What would be in that section, would be things like grants, loans, your own investments Say you 're bringing in computers and stuff into the business you 'd put it in there at the value that it 's worth So say I 'm bringing in my computer at fifteen hundred pounds I would show my own investment of fifteen hundred pounds in there Okay Uhm family investment, loans and HP would also go in there too Okay so say you 're getting HP finance at ten thousand you would put it in okay And that 's your funding What it is it 's incomes that 's not through sales Okay It 's actually capital income It 's not sales income Okay so it 's funding or capital income And after that if you look at the top there, it 's called revenue income that 's actually income from sales Okay Now in this case if you look it 's just uhm, there 's just the one category, sales Sometimes if you 're in business and what you do is you would bill, for your services you mightn't get paid immediately Okay Say the like of me I 'm self-employed What would happen I would usually write out a bill at the end of the month you know for all the work I have done Okay Now I would submit that Now depending who it 's to I mightn't get paid til the next month cos a lot of the businesses have like uhm a cheque run at the end of the next month So if I submit it tomorrow I won't get paid really the end of June Okay so when I 'm doing a cash flow then I need to know, sort of when the cash is actually coming in Sometimes uhm we 've had people and it 's been like three months before they 'll get paid, okay, or they 're on contract where they get paid every six months, so you need to know that You can put that in If you were going to do that then you would have another category, in there, alright and you would actually put it in when the money is due in So even though if you started in April you 've done the work but you 're not going to get paid til June you don't put the money in then til June Okay Cash sales are very simple They just go straight in the month they 're done, cos you 're paid immediately Okay Uhm just on that if you do find that you have problems with people paying you late, there 's now a new thing in where you 're actually entitled to charge interest on overdue accounts Okay so we have some leaflets up the stairs if anybody 's interested You 're allowed to charge eight percent actually on overdue accounts Whether you ever get it or not don't know but it might scare people into paying you quicker, if they think you can charge you Okay Uhm the next category then, see if you look at the second category down revenue expenditure And they 're all your running costs that we looked at earlier so there 'd be your fixed overheads and your variable  or sorry your variable costs, or your direct Okay And you go through uhm the person whose this is they have no materials at all because they were a service industry Okay But they did have rent and rates eighty pounds a month They paid twenty-five pounds a month towards their heat and light bill, hundred pounds a month for telephone, forty pounds a month for transport So you can see all the fixed costs going down there", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "364ee13e-453d-48ae-8a4f-f8b21be72f11", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.346519+00:00"}
{"text": "<Mental health>\n\n\n<$A> We have a separate operational programme for the purposes of these initiatives, uhm which will be prepared by Mark Pinkerton 's branch in the T and EA Uhm, what we did was sent out a mailshot, which I think most of you should have had uhm we also advertised in the Telegraph asking for people to send in written submissions by the twenty-fifth of August And I know the time scale is very tight on that and it came at a bad time uhm with people on holidays and all the rest of it but uh we needed responses quickly uhm because the draft OPs have to be in Brussels by the end of September, so we 're really working to the Commission 's timetable and not ours, and I apologise for the rush that uhm appeared to be uhm motivating this whole thing Uhm what happens is that uh we have taken the submissions that we 've received in writing from people Now out of, we sent out five hundred mailshots, NICVA also circulated it to their mailing list which is another five hundred, and the ad in the paper was the third strand Now we 've had sixty submissions overall for all the different interest groups which is quite low but Gerry was telling me that there may have been other motivating factors which maybe stopped people uhm sending in submissions Apparently there was a note going round to say don't reply because you haven't been given enough time to reply So, anyhow, anybody who did write and say we haven't time, they were asked to bring along the submission to these workshops this week So what we 've done is we 've just pulled out from the list of written submissions that we 've had so far a list of bullet points which you 'll find on uh the sheet marked workshop one So that 's what the first session uhm really should work itself around Uhm, the second part after the coffee break then will be more directed to the actual operational programme, and we 've pulled out a number of points again from the Commission documentation on that, on the sort of things that they would like to see in the operational programme Uhm and we 've also given you uh a photocopy of the more expanded eligible measures notes from the guidelines for the operational programmes which we may or not work through as you feel appropriate in in that second session Uhm, Mark uh is next door, doing the same job so we 're not actually going to uhm you 're not going to see both of us unless he floats uh once he 's done his opening spiel, but he 's done out a few introductory remarks on what an operational programme is so maybe if I just read through those and try and put that in the picture to start with and then we can get down to uhm the workshop one sheet Uhm, member states are responsible during the  preparatory phase for negotiating with the Commission national operational programmes, setting out the main priorities, eligible measures, and details of implementation arrangements But approved by the Commission these operational programmes will provide the basis for the selection of individual projects by the member state authorities The communications to the member states of which you have received a copy sets out the broad framework for the initiative Within this framework the member states ' operational programmes are expected to identify specific priorities and types of measures designed to address specific problems, circumstances and target groups So the Northern Ireland OP has to provide a general, social and economic background uh for the particular target group, describe the local situation in terms of the problems faced by the various target groups, the provision currently being made for them, the gaps in the provision, past successes and failures and so on, and select activities from amongst those set out in the communication, flesh them out and relate them, relate them to the specific needs in Northern Ireland The Commission has set out a standard framework or checklist for each measure of which you 've received a copy At all stages you need to bear in mind the general principles set out in the communication Now the thing that makes these initiatives different from mainstream ESF primarily is the trans-national dimension, uhm so trans-national dimension is vitally important Innovation the projects all have to be innovatory Now innovation again was not really defined by the Commission the last time round It was left up to each individual project bidder to come up with their definition of what was innovatory about their particular project Now to a certain extent we 've accepted innovation as being innovation in terms of provision within Northern Ireland So if people were able to tap into good practice in other member states that hadn't been tried here before we accepted that as innovatory Other member states didn't and in fact  the Commission sent round a, a group of consultants very recently, and they took us to task over what we had accepted as innovatory But again that was within the terms of the old operational programme and it 's up to us to decide at this stage how we define innovation for the next time round Efficiency of systems and transparency of qualifications, co-ordinated approach and involvement of relevant actors, reinforcement of EU policies and programmes, and flexibility to meet future needs So again, the OP to a certain extent has to be drawn in fairly broad terms uh so that when it comes to the stage of actually bidding for projects from your end that uh there 's sufficient leeway there to allow what you want to do to be covered by the framework that 's that 's uh agreed by the Commission Uhm the draft OP once it 's produced, uh and again we hope to do that within the next couple of weeks and get it off to Brussels by the end of September, uhm the final version of that will go to Brussels by the end of October and then there 's a two-month consultation period uhm during which the Commission will uh agree or take issue with what we 've proposed But the important date to remember is the thirty-first of December because that 's the point at which the monies have to be committed So the OPs all have to be approved by that stage so we 're working to the end of the year basically, uhm with a call then for projects based on the operational programme in the first quarter of ninety-five Now is there anything, is that as clear as mud or I know that there 's a lot of European gobbledygook in there uhm that isn't necessarily that comprehensible so if there 's anything you want to ask me before we actually get down to looking at the points that have emerged from the written submissions so far, uhm speak now or forever hold your peace\n<$B> Who is the we in determining we define innovation\n<$A> Well the we is the, the operational programme basically So it 'll be down to Mark 's branch to decide, but the idea for what should be covered by the operation will come from these groups\n<$B> Okay\n<$A> And that 's the idea of the we, that people, exactly that people on the ground will have a say in both the the definition of terms within the OP and the general broad thrust of the OP as well, rather than have it written by uhm the background written by a columnist or whoever who are one or two removes from people at the coal face The idea is that they should be responsive, that the process should be transparent, and that you can all have your say at this stage uhm and hopefully produce an OP then that is responsive to the local need\n<$B> Now it 's a framework at this stage\n<$A> It 's it 's just a framework that uh I mean the guts of it are there in that second page the things that have to be covered in the OP and that 's the basic bones What we want today is flesh to hang on those bones, and again a lot of it, a lot of the points that we 've pulled out uh didn't necessarily come from the submissions from the two groups that are here today They came from a wider group but there are a lot of sort of uhm cross-activity issues now there are lots of points in common for all the groups who are involved in these programmes So if there are things there that don't necessarily seem to apply to this particular group uh it 's because we 've taken the wider view and pulled in points from some of the other submissions as well Uhm, Freddie has agreed to chair today and Derek has agreed to do rapporteur Lisa 's operating the tape machine Now the tape machine is not there for any sinister purpose It 's really to help at the writing up stage if there are gaps in people 's notes and we just thought it was as well to have a tape backup so I hope nobody has any objection to And it 's not going any further than the group that 's here and the people who 'll be actually working on the OPs so uhm what you say is between ourselves and nobody will necessarily be identified by anybody else So I think if nobody has any more questions on the general background to the thing uhm if I maybe hand over to you Freddie\n<$B> Okay Thanks Dan", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "48080fef-ee90-471a-ae12-fa21feee3bae", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.347377+00:00"}
{"text": "<Physical disability>\n\n\n<$A> Now I was saying I made a mistake last week I I  was doing a workshop and uh asked for volunteers for rapporteur and nobody came forward So I said right thanks very much Dan speaking to Dan Connolly so he  he said right I 'm getting you next week  That 's why Uhm I think I think the best thing to do uh is just to run through and try and uh recap on what was said, uhm and see if we cannot come up with recommendations from that uhm,   as quickly as we can in the next twenty minutes or so Uhm, just to put the thing into context again to repeat a few things that Carl said  at the opening uh of the of the workshop that we are looking at a six-year programme taking us up to the to the actually the the new decade the new millennium up to the year two thousand So it is a a long-term thing that we 're looking at and uh there are going to be a lot of factors influencing uh Northern Ireland people with disabilities during that time uh not least the super, route highway whatever it is coming across from America and various other things too We 're an Objective One country which uh is  is bound to affect our applications and the whole timing of of the uh, uh operation of plan and and the proposals going to it uh is something to bear in mind too Uh there are certain common themes that that must be met looking at the trans-national dimension the innovativeness of projects, uhm the  tendency towards the acquisition of qualifications for participants on it uh, facilitating more efficient delivery uh adopting a co-ordinated approach and that can mean an awful lot of things which I think we came to a wee bit later and flexibility in terms of uh looking at the future needs both at this stage known and unknown needs uh of people with disabilities for the next six years We looked at a definition of disability uhm, and I I think came up with uh a as Daniel was saying two sides of a coin Uh one is the uh actual disability itself and how do we uh start to implement programmes that will tackle that or uhm uh ease the the difficulties that the disability might present in terms of employment of one form or another The other side of it is looking at the sort of broader environmental problems that people with disabilities, problems is the wrong word  the the broader environmental things that face people with disabilities uh that will restrict their ability to actually uh uh do things productively uh in employment terms And the the programme is not confined to the   disability or disabled people but at uh environmental change as well with the exception of access equipment and and some of the the uh other issues like that Just one or two other things Uhm I noted the difficulty of fitting people into specific categories, uh which which maybe  maybe should be taking uh uh recognition of in the proposals Uh there is uh a an element of tailoring training to individual needs and that has resource implications which probably will be reflected in proposals that go forward but it 's important to recognise those now in order to get quality training for individuals Uhm, and also to identify all of the relevant environmental barriers uh because if we identify them then we can also identify ways of overcoming them That 's just the context of it I don't know if you want to stop then and see if there are recommendations Uhm kind of maybe of issuing a checklist of the common themes to everybody because that maybe isn't uhm, clear to everybody coming into the project new Looking at the definition of disability cos that can then lead on to other avenues for people, and and and and also the cost implications of of individual tailored  individually-tailored training and uh the environmental barriers and developing programmes in in in the context of that\n<$B> Is that a fair enough synopsis of, okay\n<$A> Uh going on to the awareness the information uhm as as as  as was being pointed out earlier the communication actually comes through very very strongly throughout all of what we 've been talking about, the need to to gather information and disseminate  information uh not just from uh, the top down so to speak from Mark down to the to the project promoters uh but also between the project promoters between different uh statutory agencies, uh between uh existing projects and new projects coming on stream the whole area of communication is is really vital Uhm,  and we do need to look at at co-operation and and co-ordination activities practical physical uh  co-ordination of of efforts uh between the statutory sector, uh between the the, project promoters and and T and EA uh  and between the project promoters themselves Also within that it  we we were  we were talking about bringing in key players who previously up to now have not been brought into the process And I think that 's true not just for European programmes but for any project that 's happening in in Northern Ireland uhm of of of identifying who is important like social workers who maybe aren't uh haven't been involved uh uh uh as much as they they could 've been to date It 's also about identifying good practice uhm and disseminating that good practice in Northern Ireland, uh and beyond Northern Ireland too Uhm, certainly it 's it 's a lot better now and the T and EA have done a lot of good work in terms of bringing people together and and and and allowing people to to tell each other what they 've been doing But certainly at the start there was there was a case of people were doing things and not knowing the left hand wasn't knowing what the right hand was doing So it 's getting better and more can be done Uhm avoiding duplication 's very important as well, essential part of the communication process We looked at mainstream uh ESF funding, and uh, uh the the good parts of Horizon One may be going into mainstream funding rather than being part of Horizon Two Uhm, a few other points just in the information awareness section uh we were talking about research uh looking at the needs of disabled people asking disabled people themselves uh what their needs were uh and and developing programmes from that or it being a programme itself Uhm, we looked at the difficulty of reaching disabled people in terms of accessing them information about them their numbers where they live, uhm and what their problems are We looked at the the the materials that were required and and I think that then also goes back to the needs of disabled people as well cos we can't assume uh what  uh what their needs are or what the materials, what, the best materials would be to to reach them Uhm the sort of people involved in that type of outreach work uhm, and as I say the numbers of disabled people and where they are Looked at the issue of raising aspirations and confidence uh amongst disabled people  come back on to that in terms as training but it 's all part of people recognising their own potential and and possibly also as I say getting onto the sort of progressive type of training and geographic distinction, distinctions in terms of the information that 's available how to get it out and also in terms of the type of initiatives that might be uh operated There may be differences and there are differences between west of the Bann and east of the Bann and north and south and, Belfast and non-Belfast and Derry and non-Derry, It 's information inawareness \n<$B> Okay right,\n<$A> Do you want me just to stand up\n<$B> Yes   just just interject if you can \n<$A>  Uh yep fine I   was going through it very quickly cos I 'm worried about the time Uhm, in terms of training uh, I think that that we were saying uh, IT is is really vitally important and is going to become more important as as the years go go on Uhm, and that there are problems in opportunities that are associated with uh developing IT training specifically for people with disabilities, but that there is a a vital need to to uh be looking at projects, developing projects that are a lot broader than just IT uhm, looking at other uh, uh skill development for people with disabilities uh particularly given the context of where the employment opportunities may lie uh, both now and in in five and ten years ' time Uhm uh IT even for any job uh is only one part of it There are a lot of other social administrative and management skills that are important uh and therefore the programmes uh hopefully will be reflecting that and and going broader than IT while while IT is actually very important Looked at uhm pre-vocational training personal skills development, again it 's linked to confidence-raising and awareness-raising aspiration-raising Uh and there may be examples of good practice even in even in Britain that we 'll we could be  adopting here uhm that uh that aren't being adopted Uh initiatives projects funding uh that that is available in Britain that that we don't have access to, here Uhm and I suppose I mean the recommendation on that probably is to look at what is happening across the water and and try and try and uh implement it here I don't know if that 's possible or not through through the Horizon initiative Uhm the Northern Ireland lacks a specialism here in terms of pre-vocational training because of its size and because of its, to an extent lack of resources uh and I suppose because of the the the number of, or the the the smaller actual number of people with disabilities here although proportionately it 's probably higher than than across the water uh head for head We looked at uh training uh uh disabled people themselves to become trainers, uhm you know which which may be a an avenue to pursue Again it 's it 's it 's something that we people who are not uhm uh very physically disabled are are have other forms of disability uhm shouldn't really be making too many assumptions about the needs of people with disabilities And uh people with disabilities who are trainers are supposed to be role models themselves uh for other people with disabilities And that 's an issue maybe of of uh, another issue of involving people with disabilities themselves uh in the development uh and uh clarification of initiatives, uhm, uh both now and and as the initiatives are are monitored on an ongoing basis Uh and then finally we looked at uh accreditation uh and uh building accreditation into existing programmes or possibly having a a central accreditation project that can provide accreditation to other projects or provide advice, uh to other projects in terms of accreditation And that 's what I had under training Anything else And this can take the form of recommendations   I suppose it 's what we what we  discussed Briefly touched on on self-employment It 's touched on other issues as well uh in in terms of empowerment uh that we 've been talking about Uhm, again there there 's an issue there of of various projects now that are being run that that uh where the the uh the information and and the successes that that that uh for example RNIB are having I you know uhm a lot of people wouldn't be aware of that\n<$B>  Mhm mhm yeah

{"text": "<Language lecture>\n\n\n<$A> Learning to talk is probably the the biggest or the greatest intellectual feat that every everyone can have to uh perform And yet despite that kind of statement of course you know we 're not conscious of actually having to perform a great intellectual feat in learning to talk So in a sense uh it 's something that uh we find ourselves doing without ever having thought about how we got there and how we achieved it Uhm today I want to look uh in a very superficial manner really at uh what goes into this business of learning language Uhm, it has to be superficial to some extent because uh it 's only an hour but also because the whole business isn't properly understood And uhm there are a lot of complicating factors which mean that it 's very difficult to understand how it all fits together uh for example uhm if you 're uh learning a language a child at any one moment can be expanding the vocabulary uh learning new concepts uh mastering a wider range of sentence structures uh learning to use expression, uhm using tone and gesture in a sort of a more sophisticated way and so on Along with that we have all these simultaneous tasks that seem to interact with each other uh and develop towards adult language just like <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> task I 'd like to start off by looking at uh what people in the past have done about studying the acquisition of language Uhm and when you read text books on the acquisition of language sometimes it looks as if people had never uhm become interested in it until about the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies the way that the text books talk In fact that 's not true at all Uhm if you go back to the eighteenth century there was a very famous German biologist called Tiedemann uh and uh he initiated a long line of uh observational diary-type studies in which people kept diaries of how a child 's language developed Uhm, and uh he was uh quoted as having described how children went through from sort of the babbling phase to saying one-word type utterances to putting together two-word type utterances uh to a very famous uh kind of statement uhm of what his child who he was studying came up with at the age of two and a half He said eventually by the age of two and a half the child was able to open his mouth and make this lovely statement and the statement was the child said, uhm, the Son of God said tomorrow he will get up again drink his tea and eat his bread and butter A very kind of erudite uhm child but uh the point that is made is that by two and a half uh children have the beginnings of being able to talk in reasonably adult sentences, though I 'm not sure that you 'll ever find a child of two and a half who will actually say something like that That 's another matter Uhm, Darwin Charles Darwin also kept a study a diary study of a child 's uh development of language And that was followed by other people, people such as Werner, uh Leopold and who kept a long uhm diary studies from nineteen thirty-nine to nineteen forty-nine So when we get all this talk in the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies about uhm language acquisition in fact uhm it 's really a re-emergence of a study that that had already been in earlier times And it re-emerged for a very good reason It re-emerged because in a sense it had been suppressed earlier on in the twentieth century because one of the schools of thought earlier on was called the behaviourist school of thought and it was again their whole uhm outlook on science to look at uh language acquisition as development and you don't need to go into the details of that cos you know the details but, that was why or partly why there haven't been many studies preceding the sixties and seventies Now, let 's sort of start from first principles to understand how language is uhm produced and uh hence how it 's acquired Uhm, and first principles take us to some biological aspects of the acquisition of language And the first one of these is probably the brain I 'm sure you 've seen slides like this before but uhm, Did that make that noise, mm, Well let me get it working There 's no light probably Well that 's fine okay I can't show you the brain then Well we can always try to talk about the brain instead Uhm, there 's uh there 're two sides to the brain firstly there 's the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and uh these are crucial and related to the whole business of uhm language and language development Uhm the uh it is normally said that the left hemisphere the left side of the brain controls uh language and there are particular areas in the left side of the brain or the left hemisphere which are thought to be responsible for particular areas of language Uhm these are called uhm uh, Broca 's area and the Wernicke 's area, and uh they are responsible or generally speaking uh the Broca 's area is related to the production of speech and Wernicke 's to uh the perception or comprehension of speech Now uh this uh basic notion of the brain and language and it being in the left hemisphere or the central left hemisphere is interesting when you get onto talking or thinking about the acquisition of language as such, because uhm because we know that in adult uhm brains and in adult language it 's the left hemisphere that 's involved in language production it would be tempting to think that somehow the left hemisphere is at the very start predisposed to uhm being a hemisphere oozing with language but in fact and it 's the right hemisphere that 's somehow not suitable But in fact you you look at uhm it not experiments but you know accidents that well which have happened, uh which uhm happen early on a child 's life say in the first year of life whereby a child uh has uh most of the left hemisphere removed by surgery in fact you 'll find that that child can talk uhm and uh can produce language with only the right hemisphere though the speech won't be as good as it would be if uhm you had the left hemisphere and not the right hemisphere So uhm you know it does seem that the left hemisphere may uh not be as may not have as much innate properties in it as it were, conditioning or uh conditioned to language acquisition or to language development as might be thought But somehow along the way uhm it seems to get dominated by language <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>, probably because it gets dominated quite early on and uhm then later on when you come on to do other types of tasks like spatial tasks and so on they tend to go over into the right hemisphere It takes over the control of those Uhm and it 's  it 's probably the case that the left hemisphere is used initially for language and then becomes uh pre-empts the use of anything else in that hemisphere with, uh any other function as much Uhm,  it 's probably that case because uh the left hemisphere uh develops faster and so it may be uh better as it were for the acquisition of language But whatever uhm all the arguments formulae for the right and left hemisphere and so on it 's just useful to know that uh by and large we talk about language in the left hemisphere uhm and it looks as if uh it 's not fundamentally crucial in the early very early years of life but subsequently takes over the function of uh language Now another thing that 's uh very important in learning to talk is hearing of course Uhm if you can't hear if you 're born congenitally very deaf uh you won't learn to speak in any kind of uh way that we would call normal speech Uhm on the other hand uh you would still develop language so there 's this innate this innate ability for language there because deaf people will learn to sign and that is a language in its own right Signing is a language and we refer to it as sign language Uhm so uh you need hearing then to produce actual normal speech but language uhm you can produce even if it 's only signed language or even if it 's signed language Uh without uh hearing Now, uhm in spite of all this you need to have some kind of exposure to language if you 're going to learn to talk So if you in fact have all the natural biological requisites but you 're not exposed to language it would appear that you won't learn language And there 've been various experiments done over the years which suggest this and I think you may well have heard of some of these already Uhm there uh, were experiments uhm which were as it were uhm partly uhm well no some of them were accidental and some of them were deliberate Uh some of the deliberate ones are referred to often as The Royal Experiments because they involved a group of royal people in various countries in the world much, a long time ago uh actually carrying out experiments to see what would happen if you locked children up uhm and kept them away from any adult uhm or any uh form of language uh, you would find out uh why whether they learned to talk or not And uh there were several people who did this uhm well are reported to have done it uh James the Fourth of Scotland, uhm Akbar the Great, uhm Frederick the Second uh and one of the Egyptian Pharaohs, uhm Solomon And they apparently are uh reported to have interned children uh with primate caretakers uh and then gone back uh a long time later to see whether they could speak or not, and lo and behold they found that they didn't speak and they were absolutely mute Uhm so uh the conclusion that one has to come to and there 're other there 's other experimentation which suggests the same thing is that you have to have some degree of exposure to language before you 'll learn uhm to actually talk Now, there are more recent experiments which suggest that it 's not just you know absolutely straightforward that you must have exposure to language to be able to talk Uhm perhaps to produce speech oral you know speech that you can hear you 're going to need some exposure to that speech But to produce a language which is not necessarily spoken like a sign language for instance uhm, it would appear that you can do that even if you are uh at least to some extent even if you are not exposed to language and I want to uh report another experiment which suggests that This is a more recent one in uh the States uhm in the I think the seventies or so Uhm and uh what happened there sort of came about by accident really with a group of uhm, well at one stage it was fairly common with uh congenitally profoundly deaf children uh to try to get them to learn how to speak rather than signing uh and of course as you 're probably well aware there 's a big debate over whether to sign or to whether to speak And uh the at some stages these children uh were prevented in schools uhm from  from learning to sign They weren't taught any sign language and what 's more they weren't allowed sign Teachers would stop them in the belief that if they weren't encouraged to sign and weren't subjected to sign language they would then learn oral language much better Uh in fact that 's not true It 's been shown since that uhm uh letting them sign will actually help them acquire oral language rather than hinder them But anyway this group of children uhm were studied uh because they were not allowed to sign Their parents were told not to sign to them because it would be encouraging them to get into bad habits of signing rather than oral speech And uh their teachers at school didn't sign to them So of course they were profoundly deaf so they couldn't hear and because they were profoundly deaf and couldn't hear they didn't develop speech very easily Uhm and they couldn't sign either so you might say that they were living in a kind of uhm context where there was very little exposure to language I know it wasn't absolute non non-exposure I 'm sure, but there was very there was limited exposure Uhm but in fact these children are shown to have developed in spite of all the restrictions on them to have developed their own kind of form of uh language which was a system of as it were gestures", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c117bb42-3934-4c38-9dcf-bf8a05427406", "added":

{"text": "<Maths Lecture 1>\n\n\n<$A> Anyway, here 's an example uhm which I 'd just got you to write down the last day but which uhm well I hadn't had time to explain Let me talk more about it now, Especially to non computer science people I hope, it makes some sort of sense to you computer science characters out there, but the rest of you, including myself, let me try to explain it What it 's about, is that you have some sort of a programme which calculates variables uhm and, this this programme is going to the same loop again and again The loop consists of eight steps so the programme calculates something on step one step two step three down to step eight and then goes back to step one again So this is a loop So, seven follows six, eight follows seven, and one follows eight Okay you keep going round and round in here Now there are four variables that you need to store temporarily at different stages as you go through this process, And that 's what these lines are meant to indicate, Variable A you need to store during steps one two and three, You need to store You don't need it in step four, and you need to store it again in steps five and six, And likewise B is needed in steps what is it three four five C C is needed in steps six seven eight, and D is needed in step eight, followed by step one, remember this is a loop So you need it in eight and then you need it in the following step which is one as well, Now the question is, okay you have to store these things somewhere or other and that 's that 's this phrase above called index registers, Each of these variables, when it 's being stored is stored in something called an index  register, and an an index register can hold exactly one variable, So the question in all of this is how many index registers do you need in the sense of what 's the minimum number that you need, Obviously four of them are enough You could have one which you labelled A and it, stored A some of the time, did nothing some of the time, stored A again and then did nothing, And then you could 've another one that stored B some of the time and the rest of the time did absolutely nothing, So you could, and so on You could have another one that stored C and a fourth that stored D So you could do it with four storage, four index registers, But the question is what 's the minimum number that you can do it with, So, let me continue Uh well hold on Before I go on to try to analyse this The analysis is actually quite short, it 's shorter than than the, description of the problem Is there any questions so far on the the description of what 's going on here Is everyone clear on that, Is that clear enough Yes Is anyone awake Okay Alright So clearly four registers, that 's assigning one of these registers to each of the four variables A B C D Obviously four registers, one per variable will suffice, but that 's that 's clear from the word go but we 'd like to do it more economically than that if possible, Now I 've written down there \" could be used less \" but, as I see it in writing I realise I should be saying is \" could be used fewer \", Oops So four registers will work but, can we get away with say three or two or one, So could we use fewer than four, So could we have a register of let 's, say some of the time, let 's see, for example B and C are not needed at the same time You could 've a register that stores B some of the time and stores C some of the time, Okay and some of the time it 's doing nothing again but, that 's you know instead of having a separate register for B and a  and for and another second one for C, just have one register that sometimes does B sometimes does C That can obviously be done So at a glance you could say that well just doing that alone, You could have a register for A You could have a register that does B and C so to speak, and a register for D and three registers will work That 's at a glance So,  can you go further Could you use two, Now a naive, interpretation, or perhaps interpretation isn't the best word but, a naive interpretation of the problem would be as follows You look at the problem and you would say look, at any one moment in this particular, uhm, loop, you never need more than two variables at the same time On step one you need A and D simultaneously On step two you need only A Step three you need A and B simultaneously and so on, But on every step you only need at most two variables And so you might argue from that, that uhm at most two index registers are needed cos you never need to store more than two things at the same time, Well you might argue like in fact as we 'll see you 'd be wrong So, at any one time only two variables are being temporarily stored We never need to store more than two things at a time so are, would two of these index registers, two of these storage places suffice, At any one time only two variables are being temporarily stored, So, would two registers suffice, Now you could try by experiment to try and allocate, working with two registers, to allocate them to different variables at different times and see does it work out In fact it won't, but I, rather than do it just as a computer science problem I want to of course turn it into a graph theory problem That 's what the course is all about I 'll analyse it from that point of view, Now, the the basic, thing here and I 'll write this down in a second, is that, there, you are trying to allocate variables to registers, but conflicts arise, in that uhm you may want, for the same register you may be trying to put two variables in the same register at the same time and when you 've conflict problems you generally have a graph colouring problem I 'll say more about this in a second I I 'm going to construct a graph G that corresponds to the problem, Now, I think for this example maybe, of all the examples in the whole course this is the example where it 's hardest to guess what the graph should be, It 's not obvious at all I think Uhm well what do you think you might try as the nodes or edges in this particular graph Any ideas, I mean just just make a guess, It 's a it 's, if someone makes a guess we can work from that perhaps to something else Any ideas\n<$B> The variables\n<$A>  okay the A B C D Okay try the nodes as the variables And then, what 'll the edges be When do we join two variables by an edge, You 're on you 're on the right track It 's it 's not the  it 's not actually perfect as we 'll see but it 's almost correct If you take the nodes as the variables uhm when then are, do we join two variables by an edge do you think Again it has to somehow represent the data of the problem, the the graph that you draw, has to somehow, you 've to somehow transfer this data onto a graph So if the nodes were the variables, when would you, when do you think you might link two variables by an edge, Can you guess\n<$C> If you need them at the same time\n<$A> If you need them at the same time Okay, That 's basically it, If if two variables are wanted at the same time like A and B you can join them by an edge, Now, that 's almost correct, The only problem comes up in that, okay A clashes with B here and in some sense although here A clashes with B as well it 's not the same A so to speak, It 's it 's a it 's a, it 's another appearance of A And the only thing, the only thing wrong with what we said so far is that instead of having uh nodes corresponding to variables I 'll use a different node for this appearance of A than from this appearance of A here, okay, So it 's a slight modification of <unclear> several words </unclear> as being the variables themselves but as I say that that 's far from obvious, Don't don't regard this as an easy or obvious step, To construct a graph G with nodes corresponding to storage periods of different variables, Nodes corresponding to storage periods of different variables and edges joining each pair of nodes corresponding to overlapping periods, And edges joining each pair of nodes corresponding to overlapping periods, Now the sentence is a bit of a mouthful What 's it saying, I 've talked about the nodes already, The nodes are basically B C and D and a node I 'll call A one and another node I 'll call A two, corresponding to the two times that A shows up in this loop, The edges, simply  join two nodes that happen to clash in the sense that they uhm, that they both, you need both their values at the same time in the loop, Now, I asked you to draw the graph actually the hard way around in a sense that I asked you what 're the nodes and then what 're the edges You 've heard me ask that question several times before It 's the usual way that you try to model a problem by a graph You draw the nodes then the edges, However, when it comes to problems like this where there 's a conflict involved and the conflict in this  in this case is that you have two variables that are required at the same time so they can't be in the same index register, they 're in conflict in some sense With conflict problems it often works out better from your point of view if you try to think of first of all what are the edges then are the nodes That may sound like it 's logically impossible but in fact, it it may not be so obvious with this problem which I think is a tricky one, but with other problems on the handout which are graph colouring problems uhm, in general if there 's a conflict there of some sort like this one I talked about the last day of putting animals in cages in the zoo okay You 'd be better off looking for the conflicts first and the nodes second The conflicts in that  in that situation would be, well tigers and rabbits are in conflict okay the one eats the other, alright that situation So let me just mention this here, Note, edges model conflicts between nodes, This is common in colouring problems, Edges model conflicts between nodes, This is common in colouring problems, Now I 've put the word \" common \" in there uhm just for insurance My experience has been that this is always the case in colouring problems but mathematicians are by nature cautious, so I hesitate to write down this as always true, in case someone runs with an example next week which shows it 's not true, But every example I can ever recollect seeing of a colouring problem the edges model a conflict of some sort Okay after all that, what 's the graph Well this is the graph It 's a very simple graph The nodes there are the, well the variables B C and D, and A crops up twice because it 's stored twice in the process of this loop So, the first time I 'm calling A one and the second time I 'm calling A two, Now the edges remember correspond to nodes that are in conflict, nodes that are required by the programme at the same step so if you look back at the diagram originally where I where I described when when you need the different variables you see that, the first time A one shows up it 's needed at the same time as B and it 's also needed at some stage at the same time as D C is needed at the same time as D at some point in the programme C is needed at the same time as the second appearance of A, at some point in the programme as well and so on, So the number of edges is quite small there, because well, there aren't that many clashes between different nodes, Is everyone happy with the graph Okay so that 's a graph that that 's just another way of representing the data of the problem Okay it 's it 's it 's just a different way of presenting it What 's it got to do with a graph colouring Now the colouring of this graph, I suppose this is the crunch sentence in the whole thing The colouring of the graph corresponds to assigning index registers to storage periods,",

{"text": "<Maths lecture 2>\n\n\n<$A> Each colour is an index register That 's what that 's what I 'm saying I 've underlined the words there to sort of say that, Now colouring of the graph corresponds to assigning index registers to storage periods, Okay now why is that true Why is that what we want Well, basically we we 're going to colour this graph We 'll talk about that in a second, we That 's uh easy to do because the graph is so simple We 'll colour the graph in a minute and then different colours okay, two adjacent nodes must have two different colours Now what that means is they must be assigned to different index registers and that 's exactly the way you want it, because if two nodes are joined by an edge, that means they are needed at the same time in the programme and that means they should not be assigned to the same index register They should not have the same colour So colouring as we 've known it up to now ensures that different nodes which are adjacent end up in different index registers So our colour is an index register in this case Now this is often a point of difficulty in colouring problems uhm in the sense of trying to spot what 's the connection between the colour and the solution of the problem but in this case the colours are the index registers Now the actual colouring of this graph this is a very simple one we 've done much harder ones If you try to colour it using two colours you 'll find you can't do it, because if you start say with colour one here uh this has to be two, this has to be one, this has to be two, this has to be one, and now you 've got a problem This is one and this is one as well So it didn't work with two colours You 're forced to put in a third colour somewhere along the way, uhm to do it So I want to just say it 's easy to see that in fact three colours are needed And that 's the minimum The chromatic number is three You need three colours, plus you cannot do it uhm, plus, uh you can do it with three colours and you cannot do it with fewer Let me put it that way, So three registers will be needed, Now that is a little bit surprising given the fact that I  what I pointed out earlier, that uhm, that, at any given moment in this running of this loop you never need more than two variables at a time So you might think therefore two uh two places to store them should do the job But you sit down and try to do it and you 'll basically end up with the same problem I ended up a moment with ago with, when I went round here trying to colour this using two colours I ended up getting trapped at the end If you try doing the same thing uhm with storing the variables in two registers as you go, forget about graph theory, you will find that two registers just don't work You will need a third one You 'll get trapped otherwise Well suppose one has made a colouring of this with three colours, uhm I haven't done it but anyway, this would be a typical sort of answer you finish up with So I 'll just draw one means colour one in this case so I 'll just draw two is colour two or just uh three is colour three And that 's just one possible solution and there are many possible solutions, Okay,  that now is a difficult enough problem because of the amount of technical jargon that 's thrown in there so, uhm if there, are there any questions on it I 'd be happy to answer them, Okay let 's let 's just leave that My main purpose for doing that as you see the graph was quite simple, was on the one hand to do, to do something that uhm, you know, that was an applied problem in some sense and translate it to a graph, and the second was to sort of nod towards computer science to, well perhaps entertain the computer science people here although you may not have liked being entertained Okay, let 's go onto something else, more more mathematical this time, we 're still at colouring Now what we 've done so far is okay we 've learned what the chromatic number is We 've done some we 've found the chromatic number of certain graphs by just analysing them basically We had a couple of rules which helped us along but we did need some thinking as well Now in practice if you have a large and complicated graph you very often will not be able to or will not want to find out the chromatic number It 's just too complicated a problem to colour the graph with with great effort using the minimum number of colours because it is in general a hard problem What you would often, be inclined to do is to settle for something a little less which is a lot less painful Instead of making a great effort and using exactly the minimum number of colours to colour a graph you might make a very feeble effort and use slightly more than the minimum number of colours to colour the graph In terms of this example of putting animals in cages in the zoo what it means is that maybe in theory the minimum number of cages you need in your zoo is seventeen, but maybe it it just takes a lot of thought and planning to to arrange the animals just so, so that seventeen cages work Maybe with very little effort you could stuff all the animals into nineteen cages, and for many people many situations often this is a good deal You just do something simple and easy to do and you end up with an answer which may not be an optimal answer, the best possible, but is usually very close to it, and this is what 's called the Welsh Pole Colouring algorithm This is an easy algorithm It 's it 's quite simple to use, Okay so some  some notation before I describe it S throughout the algorithm will be the set of uncoloured nodes of our graph, S is the set of uncoloured nodes of the graph G and as usual G is a set of vertices, a set of edges, Now to begin with, S is the set of all nodes, no nodes are coloured to begin with So to begin with S equals V, and then as the algorithm proceeds S gradually shrinks until eventually S becomes the empty set, and in other words we 've coloured the entire graph We 'll keep, the way it works is we, instead of colouring this node one then that node two then this node three or so on, what we do is we take one colour in our hand, colour number one, we colour certain nodes on the graph, we throw that colour away We then take colour number two, we colour certain nodes on the graph, throw that away So at each stage I want to keep track of what colour we are presently using So I throughout would be the colour counter It 's the colour that we 're using at any given stage in the graph, Okay step one is just initialising everything So step one, we set S equal to V So initially all nodes are uncoloured, that 's all I 'm saying, and we start with colour number one As I 've said before we we don't talk about colours like red green blue et-cetera We could, but it 's simpler to just talk about them as colours number one two three So we start with colour number one Now step two is the hardest step in the algorithm and having said that, as you 'll see it 's a very easy step Step two, list the nodes of S in order of decreasing degree, So you list, you  you have to calculate the degree of every node, we know that 's very easy And then you make a list of the nodes,  where the nodes of highest degree come at the top of the list, the nodes of  of lowest degree come at the bottom of the list Now in a typical example this list there 's more than one way of doing this I mean for example, if you had a graph all of whose nodes were degree three then you could list the nodes in any order you like and it 's all the same because they all have the same they all have the same degree So in general, uhm, there there 's more than one way of doing the list and it and it doesn't matter which way you do it, there 's no agonising over this particular step You just put nodes of degree say say five is the highest degree of any node, you put the nodes of degree five at the top of the list then the nodes of degree four then the nodes of degree three then two then one then zero if there 's any of zero Right, now the colouring then is, you start by colouring the very first node on your list Step three, assign colour I, that 's the the the current colour, the present colour And the first time through this we 'll work with colour number one Assign colour I to the first node on the list, So you colour your first node on the list with colour I your current colour And then you simply go down through the list once, colouring every node as you go that you are legally allowed to colour In other words that is not adjacent to a node that you 've already coloured with the same colour So you go once down through the list You colour the first node for sure because that colour hasn't appeared on the graph yet so you can colour that with impunity Then the second node may or may not be colourable with the same colour If it is, do so, if it 's not because it 's adjacent to the first ignore it and go on to the third You just go down once through the list colouring nodes as you go as many as you can Then in sequence, to each so, continuing on there, assign colour I to the first node and then assign colour I in sequence to each node on the list, which isn't adjacent to one already coloured with I, Then in sequence to each node on the list not adjacent to one already coloured with I, Now if that 's clear well and good, if if it 's not quite clear I 'll do an example in a second it 'll be very clear I think  there 's more description of the algorithm coming but it 's it 's very small, very minor, uhm the algorithm basically consists of going through steps two and three again and again And in fact step two as we 'll see you, in a sense you only do it once Step three is the one where you do the colouring but it 's an easy step So if we can just roll on here Step four, is you, you 've used up colour I now in step three You 've coloured as many nodes as you can, loosely speaking In step four you move on to the next colour I becomes I plus one So if I was one you now change I to two If I was two you now change it to three So step four we 're just updating I Step five is we, I suppose I could have put these two steps together Step five is you update S S was the set of all colour, all uncoloured nodes, which we just coloured a few of them So you update S by removing from S the ones you 've just coloured That 's all So the new S is equal to the old S less the nodes that you coloured in step three So all it means is you have a list of uncoloured nodes and you delete the nodes from that list as you colour them That 's all I 'm saying Now you keep on doing this uhm well in the following sense, until the graph is completely coloured Step six, if S is equal to five If S is the empty set, you stop, you 've coloured S is the set of uncoloured nodes, if that set is empty then  in other words you 've coloured everything so you stop If S is the empty set stop, and if not, you go back to step two Step two is where you start colouring again I 'm sorry it 's where you list the nodes in order then start colouring, Okay, uhm before I do an example with the algorithm The algorithm takes longer to describe than to do okay but there 's a, believe me it 's an easy algorithm Uhm let me just mention what the algorithm does for you and what it doesn't do for you Note that this algorithm may use more colours than necessary, The algorithm may use more colours than necessary It 's it 's not, the algorithm in other words is not guaranteed to use the minimum number of colours It may use more So for example, if it uses five colours, if it uses say five colours, well what conclusion can one draw from this You can only conclude from this, well if the algorithm uses five colours that tells you obviously that the graph is five-colourable, five colours work But it does not tell you, for example that four colours wouldn't work It 's possible the algorithm has been a little bit uneconomical in its use of colours Maybe it 's used five when four actually worked So you cannot conclude from this that the chromatic number is five that the minimum number is five You can only conclude the chromatic number is less than or equal to five It 's possible that a fewer number of colours would work The algorithm tells you nothing about this, okay, You can only conclude from this that the chromatic number is less than or equal to five You cannot, you cannot conclude that the chromatic number is equal to five Now beware of this This, this sort, this algorithm crops up frequently enough on the summer exam and people are forever doing this to me that they do the algorithm correctly They use say five colours and then they write down happily therefore the chromatic number is five That 's not true All you can conclude is that the chromatic number is at most five It might be smaller You might be able to get away with a fewer number of colours, a smaller number of colours,", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL",

{"text": "<Geography lecture>\n\n\n<$A> I just wanted you to have the correct equation I know you 're not going to be doing anything in particular with it but, That 's very uhm, it 's kind of hard to see is it, And for those of you who are not familiar with this symbol, that 's the partial differential It 's like DY DX Okay for those of you who 've done that It means the change in something, okay It means a partial derivative Okay, I just wanted to do that because I didn't want you to have something that was all wrong in your notes People who just came in this is the correction for that temperature equation that I gave you two lectures ago So you can write it down correctly and put it back in where the other one is, and do what you like with it after that Okay, we finished up talking the last day about the actual mechanics I 'm sorry I 'm just going to shut the door <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Of how, the mechanics of how the GCM works And today we 're going to look a little bit at the results of those GCM, simulations You 'll remember that the way it 's done is that we run a controlled simulation, which, is a simulation of the climate unperturbed more or less as it is now supposedly, and then we run a perturbation simulation So we have a control and a perturbation And in our case the perturbation simulation we 're going to be looking at is the double carbon dioxide simulation And once you have those two then you compare them to see what you think is going to happen Now, the results from the different GCMs produce different temperature changes So let 's have a quick look at just the temperature change which would be, you subtract the control from the perturbation and find the difference Right Okay so say your control temperature for the grid box around Cork was about, you know, say an average of ten degrees centigrade for the year And in your perturbation run for that particular grid point let 's say the temperature was twelve degrees centigrade for the year Then you have a difference of two degrees And what you 're looking at is that difference Okay So now we 're going to look at that average difference for the globe, for a number of different GCMs Now the way this graph is made up is that these, each dot represents a simulation, a perturbation simulation These dots are for only halving the carbon dioxide So they also do perturbation simulations in halved carbon dioxide, just to check and see Cos it 's interesting Even though we 're, we don't think that 's going to happen But it 's interesting to see, to see if the opposite happens to what we expect for a doubling Okay so it 's a kind of a cross check These are all the simulations that 'll run for doubled carbon dioxide There were quite a number run for four times carbon dioxide even though we don't expect that to happen any time soon And there were just a few done for ten times the carbon dioxide levels we now have, which we obviously don't expect either but, just for, again to learn more about how it works, we will do these very extreme kinds of simulations These three categories are, energy balance model, radiator convective model, and uhm, global climate model, which are the three types of model we talked about before Now we 're only going to be really looking at the global climate model results So if we look at the doubled carbon dioxide which I 've highlighted there in purple, which is where the bulk of the  the simulations the bulk of the experiments have been made You can see then on the Y axis on the vertical, the change in temperature that those simulations forecast for the entire earth So this is a mean rise in temperature So anything below this line is for a cooling, and as you 'd expect, the ones where carbon dioxide was halved showed a cooling Okay the exact opposite to what we expect for a doubling The ones where they were doubled showed a rise in temperature anywhere there between zero and up to what 's the highest one there nine point two, nine point five Four times you can see that they 're a bit higher up Ten times is very odd they 're scattered but there were only three of them and they were done very early on, with not very sophisticated models And as you can see there 's only one for each type of model as well so it 's not a lot to be said about that Let 's come back to these ones You can see that the range, for the energy balance models which are the very simple ones that don't include clouds and don't include moisture, don't include all the feedback mechanisms which are very important, had very extreme values, right up to nearly ten degrees increase for doubled carbon dioxide But when you come to a more sophisticated model like the radiator convective model, or even more sophisticated to the to the global climate model, and once you have all of the feedbacks that we 've talked about, coming in to the equation you can see that there 's a much smaller rise in temperature Okay so the energy balance model is only looking at energy balance It doesn't look at incoming radiation outgoing radiation no clouds no nothing Okay whereas here we 're looking at the influence of clouds and you can see that the range is from a very tiny increase up to about five degrees Okay these are what the GCMs produce So there 's quite a range of, changes in temperature for a doubling of carbon dioxide Now since this uh work has been done the, that this graph is based on, you can see that a lot of these are quite early they go up to the last one was about nineteen eighty-three There have been more experiments done since then and it has narrowed the gap somewhat but it is still very variable Why then could this be variable Well it 's for the reasons we talked about the last day You have different kinds of parameterisations of the physics that are involved, different ways of producing clouds, different ways of dealing with all those sub-grid scale processes, that we really can't look at at a scale of you know five hundred kilometre boxes And they all do it differently and, there 's really no best one Like some will do convective clouds better Those are, like uhm thunder clouds, which are very tall very narrow clouds and they 're very hard to do And actually that that hasn't been done particularly well by anyone but, you know, some people have a better system for that Others have a better system for stratus low-level cloud which is that like, you know, heavy low-level raincloud that you get Some of them will do that very well But none of them do everything very well You know some of them will deal with ozone better, some of them will deal with something else better So that 's why we get this variation in them and there really it really has not been narrowed down much more than that So we have to just go with that Now, the experiments that I 'm going to be talking about in more detail today, are all, equilibrium change experiments You 'll remember the last day we talked about uhm uhm equilibrium change and time dependent change The equilibrium change is when you double the carbon dioxide, you let the model run, and then you see what the answer is at the end when it 's settled down You don't look at what happens along, along the way because it 's not realistic anyway, because you 're doubling it instantaneously Okay So these are going to be all equilibrium change Now you might well ask, why do they bother doing equilibrium change experiments when they 're not really that realistic In fact they 're not realistic at all because you have an instantaneous doubling, of carbon dioxide whereas we know that it increases gradually, as people use more and more fossil fuels and so on Well there are a number of reasons The first reason is that it uses a lot less computer time Okay So this is computationally much more efficient So less computer time, And that is the principal reason A second reason is that they have compared, the results, from the equilibrium change experiments, and the results from the time dependent experiments, and they found that they can actually scale this answer So say you 've got an answer of say five degree change for the globe They can actually match that and say well that means that if would be, you know two and a half after so much time, three degrees after so much time, four degrees after so much time, by comparing it with a time dependent experiment And so even though they don't run the time dependent experiment they can get, they can get a good rough idea of what the answer from it would be, from the equilibrium change experiment which is much much cheaper to run Okay, so by scaling, we can approximate, to the time dependent experiment They run very very few of those, because they 're so expensive computationally The other one is that equilibrium change experiments give you one final answer Okay for every point on the earth we have one temperature, one precipitation, one pressure, one humidity, and so it 's very easy to compare models, whereas if you 're looking at the time dependent ones it 's much much harder, because you have to compare them at all different times, as the carbon dioxide gradually increases, and the model how the model handles that So in fact here we have ease of comparison between models And so it 's also done for that reason But actually, the real reason is this one Okay the others are, the others look good but in fact this is the  this is the real real reason This is why it 's not such a bad idea, but this is the real reason Okay so that 's why they use these particular ones We 're going to have a look then, at the kind of results they give us Now the principal problems with the results we 're going to see Oh I 'm sorry I shouldn't have moved that clip <unclear> several sylls </unclear> The principal problems with what we 're going to see, are related to the way in which the model is constructed, and, first of all, none of these have any chemical reactions in them So in other words they 'll change the amount of carbon dioxide but they don't take into account other chemical changes that might happen as a result of that You 'll remember all the different kinds of things we talked about earlier when we were talking about the different types of uhm, greenhouse gases and how they work and so on You know, we talked about the hydroxyl radical, we talked about solvents, we talked about the whole pile of things Okay so there 's no chemistry, so that 's obviously a disadvantage right away Another disadvantage with them is that they only talk about carbon dioxide The bulk of them don't deal with methane They don't deal with CFCs So that the radiation uhm Changes in the radiation balance caused by the increase in greenhouse gases is done as if it was going to be entirely carbon dioxide Okay so they don't take into account the others at all And we saw that the others while they 're quite small can be quite significant because they 're so much stronger Uhm the other one is that,  there is also an increase in sulphur compounds in the atmosphere which we haven't talked about but we will be talking about later on But they don't take those into account and they change the cloudiness, okay So cloud changes due to sulphur are not accounted for", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<Irish music>\n\n\n<$A> I 'm not sure how many of you can understand clearly what I 'm saying, uh, and, from the point of view of the English, and also from the point of view of the actual topic Uh, so what I tend to do in a talk like this, is to speak at a, a general level, an overview, uh of what we mean by Irish music Some of you may find that you 'll already know some of this, and if you do, fair enough, uh but I hope that there will be aspects of what I 'll say that will be new to everybody Uh, people talk about Irish music, uh and I think it 's worth uh dwelling for a few moments on what we mean by uh Irish music Uh, I think we mean traditional music, okay, uh and when we talk about traditional music, we uh have to ask ourselves what we mean by traditional music I think we all think that we understand what uh traditional music is I think it is difficult to define what traditional music is, but it 's relatively easy to identify a number of characteristics uh of traditional music Uh, one obvious characteristic is that it 's an aural tradition, A-U-R-A-L, uh what we mean by that is that it 's transmitted from one generation to another, and from one person to another, by means of listening Rarely do you see traditional musicians with a music stand uh reading from the music So that 's one uh very important feature of it Uh, and I suppose an aspect of that feature is the fact that it 's transmitted from generation to generation, uh maybe vertically and horizontally from one person living in one district to another person uh living in another district, so you get uh transmission both in time if you like vertically and at the same time uh horizontally if I can use those expressions Uh, there, I suppose two characteristics, it 's aural and it 's transmitted from person to person In the process of transmission it 's very obvious that the music is subject to variation and change And a very simple example of that is that if I pick out twelve people here and transmit a story to you and, you and you and you and so on, uh we can simulate maybe uh twelve or twenty transmissions if you like of the story, and at the end the story will probably be the same, in the sense that the essence of the story is the same but the details can have changed quite significantly Uh and we find that there are plenty of examples of that, evident in the case of recorded music, and indeed in the case of uh music being transmitted uh today from one musician uh to another Uh and because of that then, we uh have to come to the conclusion that there may not be one correct uh version of the story or one correct version of the piece of music If you stand up and tell the story or you tell the story well you 'll say well look this is the story as I have it, and so it is but it can differ slightly from your story because of your age or your uh country of origin, or your language even, uh or your experiences and your method of expression and so on However, we can still identify definite boundaries within which we 'll say well look that 's a different story, that 's come from somewhere else and so on Uh and in the case of music, uh that may even be more clearly defined in some respects because we 're governed by uh other factors like metre and vowel length and phrasing and tonality and in musical uh type constraints if you like Uh, now generally speaking when we hear the expression Irish music uh being used today, people tend to be thinking of traditional music, uh even though strictly speaking I suppose that if we talk about Irish music, you can talk about uh the classical music let 's say written by Sea/n O/ Riada, you can talk about U2 's music, you can talk about a wide range of music if you 're talking about Irish music However it 's generally accepted that when people talk about Irish music they mean traditional music And if you turn on the radio and hear De/ Danann, or hear the Chieftains, you 'll say that 's Irish music, if you hear U2 you 'll say that 's rock and roll You don't say it 's Irish music Uh, I know that we could dwell for a long time on the semantics and definitions of those expressions but for our purpose here today I think we 'll just use the expressions as they 're used normally by people Uh, in the case of Irish music as we now call it, it 's convenient I think for our purpose to divide it into two categories Now there are many ways in which we could divide it but for simplicity we can divide it into the categories of instrumental music and what we call the sean-no/s uh singing which is the uh old Gaelic-style singing I 'll come back to that later and I 'll I 'll give you the uh the Gaelic expression for it The instrumental tradition, uh for many people, this is the first introduction to what we call Irish music  as I said a while ago, you turn on the radio, and you 'll hear the Chieftains you 'll hear De Danann or something and you 'll say, well look, that 's Irish music, or if you don't know what it is, you 'll say look, what 's that and somebody 'll tell you, it 's Irish music And in ninety-nine percent of the cases it 's going to be instrumental music, dance music Okay Uh so it 's not surprising then that we dwell quite a lot on the instrumental music and specifically uh on the dance music And again when people talk about Irish music, they generally mean the instrumental dance music Okay So if people talk about Irish music, they certainly won't mean U2, they may not mean the sean-no/s singing, but almost certainly they 'll mean the uh uh the instrumental dance music Okay So again we 're going to use that expression uh that loosely Uh now the instrumental music is primarily dance music and of course the, how do we know it 's dance music, well all we have to do is listen to it Somebody here mentioned if you had uh room or space or inclination to dance, and the carpet is not the best for dancing I 'm not complaining about the carpet for other purposes, but for dancing it 's not the best Uh certainly the dance music is very rhythmic, there 's absolutely no doubt about that If you listen to uh traditional music, traditional dance music, probably the first feature which makes itself so obvious is the rhythm, okay And of course, dance music must have uh rhythm It 's very energetic, uh, I think it 's very exciting, there are exciting melody lines, uh exciting contours to the melody and so on So it 's very very obviously dance music Uh many many traditions uh in various countries have their own individual uh forms of dance music and their own individual dance metres Uh some of those are common across a large number of countries, but seeing that we 're talking about this country we 'll stick to uh what we have here Uh, and there are various dance rhythms, okay Many of you will be familiar with rhythms like the waltz, which is one two three one two three, like that, as distinct from a march, which is one two three four, and so on Uh so if we can extend that sort of thinking we can identify jigs reels hornpipes slides polkas uh uh set dances, maybe waltzes, mazurkas and so on Without any doubt the most common uh dance metre is what we call the reel, R-E-E-L, uh followed by I think the jig, J-I-G, jig Now within the jig there are a number of different categories I 'll play you some examples of those, but if we talk for a moment about uh what the specific metres or specific rhythms uh in these cases are I 'll play two examples here now In the case of the jig, for those of you who read music, who are interested, the jig is a six eight time, six quavers in each bar, six over eight, uh and the rhythm is very clearly dah de de dah de de dah de de dah, dey ah de de dah de de dah de de dah Like that, okay And as well as having the six notes, one two three four five six, in in some respects, it 's not so much the notes in themselves are important, but the meaning that you get from the notes, and in particular the rhythm which comes from that Uh and I suppose we can we can use the analogy of speech, and certainly the analogy of poetry, where you have metres and stresses and so on Uh we have a similar sort of thing in music where we 'll stress particular notes and particular beats In the case of the jig, we stress notes one and four, one <whispers> two three </whispers> four <whispers> five six </whispers>, one <whispers> two three </whispers> four <whispers> five six </whispers>, like that  And if I do that, we all know it 's a jig I 'm lilting, okay, or I 'm humming, even though I 'm not playing anything and I 'm not even varying uh the notes, I 'm just doing on a note of a one pitch  Okay On the other hand, well maybe if I play that first for you, and see\n\n<$A> Well suffice it to say that all the other dance rhythms have their own unique uh features, and even within the two that I 've uh given you there are many variations That last reel for instance, there are many variations possible within that But generally speaking it 's true to say that there will be a one two three four backbeat like that Now, I mentioned earlier that it 's dance music uh we 're talking about and if you turn on the radio, or you go to a concert, uh or you go to a session in the pub, the chances are that you 'll come to the conclusion that dance, that Irish music is played mostly in a listening environment Okay And that 's true Most of the music is played for listening You get a thousand people going in to a concert hall to sit down to listen to the Chieftains playing dance music Okay Uh and you may, if you think about it you may say well look is that somewhat not not strange, all this is dance music, they spend two hours playing dance music, and people sit down listening to them playing dance music Uh and how did that come about Uh, in the past, there 's no doubt that this music evolved When I say in the past now I mean up to maybe the late forties middle fifties, so the first half of this century certainly, and before that uh this music was played in people 's houses, in people 's homes, uh as a form of entertainment and also for house dances, okay So much more so in the past, this music was played for uh dancing situations It was also played for uh in a listening situation, but with the demise of the house dances uh and I suppose the swing in the, in social centres from the houses to the pubs uh the music went to the pubs and to the concert halls and to the radio and television and consequently we found that it was being played much more so for listening to Now musicians uh, fall into two camps if you like There are musicians who hate playing for dancing, and there are musicians who like to play for dancing Now I like to play for dancing but I don't like to do it all the time Okay Because we look at the music differently and we think about the music differently when you 're playing for dancing as distinct from when you 're playing for uh listening to And of course, one of the most obvious differences is the question of speed If you 're playing for uh people dancing, clearly the dancers will dictate the tempo at which they want to have it, and generally speaking, the music needs to be played as fast, lively, strong, and rhythmic uh for dancing", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "18d5346d-2806-4d9a-bfcd-3612b4c6884b", "added":

{"text": "<Business lecture>\n\n\n<$A> This morning what I 'd like to do is wrap up some ideas on, human resource planning and appraisal, And before I do that let me say that the results of the decision round will be given out next week And they make interesting reading Brief interesting reading for some of you, and more interesting reading for others So they 'll be given out next week when I collect the next decision round Alright Good And for next week would you please have read uh compensation, uhm reward and compensation systems, pages one o two et-sequitur alright, So reward and compensation systems please read for next week and that will take up the last two sessions before the, Xmas break and we 'll all go and have some festive fare, wherever we belong And this morning I 'm presuming that you have read appraising employees so I want to get back to that, uhm, before we finish Alright, what we 've been talking about, fundamentally, essentially even, and again will you just hold for four seconds before you write any of this down, is, something that this model attempts to capture So again, obviously you won't be able to write down every model between now and and May so let me just explain what what 's on what 's on here The four key words are italicised around the edges of the circle  grow buy sell maintain  In other words that one of the strategies, for your organisations or an organisation in its people-planning area, is, that it buys in people That 's the exercise we 've been going through that 's the right-hand quadrant, right You buy in individuals through external recruitment, just like you would buy in any other contract for, services, food, cleaning et-cetera Another uh  contract, is to maintain existing people, So, in your, recruitment strategies, the exercise of recruiting a European marketing manager which we went through, on the external market is just one possibility Another is to maintain people Another is to grow the individuals that you have, in some way, by development opportunities And finally, you want to, colloquially, to continue to use the, buy sell, uhm matrix and so on, you want to get rid of some people eventually all organisations inevitably will, and that 's the sell decision So, these are the human resource requirements, if you like, or the four axes of the quadrant or the four, dimensions of of of the model So if you want to write those down, and encapsulate it in some sentence such as, there are four fundamental strategies available, to the human resource function, or to the organisation, regarding people planning, four fundamental strategies <&Irish> Uimhir a haon </&Irish>, <&German> eins <&/German>, buy people That 's the traditional recruitment method and we all see, uhm that we 're aware of as Fourth Commerce graduates-to-be\n\n<$A> Morning And, that we hope obviously to be very successful at, As we progress, we are more likely to be, not so much have a job posted and be recruited, but we are likely to be maintained, in other words that we are likely to be in an organisation So the second, we 're making this  into a list rather than a fancy diagram, number one to buy, number two to maintain, And here clearly is the link to performance Maintaining somebody in post, is only efficient when their performance is of some benefit or merit to the organisation And that 's as we have discussed here one of the, utilitarian, caveats that are entered into regarding human resource management In other words as a tool of management, who decides what performance, And an instrumental approach says, that managers decide, and that 's the way traditionally life has been\n\n<$B> Good morning\n<$A> Good morning Obviously catching a lot of people on the hop here with an early start,  Tells you a lot about the class, or me, or Danny Just for the latecomers we 're, trying to wrap up the people-planning aspect of the course, and we 're suggesting this morning that there are four fundamental verbs, that sum up, human resource planning, buy, sell maintain, and grow, your people So here in terms of maintaining people keeping them in in the place, there are, planning, performance of, planning of  of performance, planning of compensation, and coaching or counselling which is different to training and I 'll come back to that, Thirdly there is the growing on of people, and here you have some succession planning in small companies or in large companies for positions that are likely to be vacated through  retirement Seamus Or, turnover et-cetera, But we 've gone from buying externally on the external spot market for labour if you like, to maintaining our  our internal people, not just maintaining them clearly,  which is a very if you like minimalist strategy we also need to grow them, and here, the idea is this is where training comes in So the difference I would make between, maintenance and growth of individuals would be that often individuals need the odd bit of counselling, on, in a maintenance mode, in other words Mr Marsh, my mark wasn't great, why Somebody from the MBA programme yesterday, saying uh our team isn't working out, can you give us a hand or whatever Somebody from this class next week, Tim our team isn't working out, you 've helped the MBAs, you 've said you 'd do it, it 's on tape , Uhm can't get out of it, versus training, which is a career development strategy locked into and integrated with the organisation 's business strategy, In other words, you 're in-situ, your, performance is adequate and so on, now let 's see if we can develop you in a certain way If we want to rotate you, to various assignments, send you overseas send you to a different site, et-cetera, And here fundamentally there 's the  issue of reserve strength of the organisation, to take a military analogy In other words, what do we have what do we have in reserve The old sporting analogy that the team is only as good as its panel, which is about to be proven by the Republic of Ireland now that Quinn is out And uh we 'll see that the people who say well Quinn wasn't really up to much uh will have a great six months trying to find a replacement, who someone he  even half-way adequate Et-cetera catches everything else which I haven't mentioned, And finally, there 's the notion of selling, the human resource or or labour, very loosely of course we 're just using these as, verbs to get us thinking Here we have, some kind of turnover is going to happen in other words And again, the human resource function needs as the organisation 's eyes and ears regarding its labour force, to be aware of, turnover and uh attempt to manage it The problem with all of this as we can see is Mr Marsh, it implies a, come on I 've given you the words already, functionalist, instrumentalist, planned, rational, analytic, and all those other words, approach to organisations, which as we know Tim is only one It is contrasted by, Henry Mintzberg 's approach which is, that patterns of strategy emerge over time That you can't always in a turbulent economic or business climate predict the future You can't do the Ansoft and Andrews planned approach to strategy, which is terribly detailed and almost assumes a nice quiet room where you go and do this, while everything else is kind of maintained You 're obviously too young to remember the Magic Boomerang Programme on television, anybody ever see that Does it ring any bell with No it doesn't Well for those of us in their early thirties , just about uhm, on the twenties side, the Magic Boomerang was this programme where this kid in Australia tried to save, a, kangaroo that was falling into a swamp Threw his boomerang, and as the boomerang was  everything stood still, allowing superhero to get to the kangaroo pull him out of the mire or tie the rope and so on, Batman-type stuff And the uh same idea is is true of the uh planned approach, its critics would maintain That it 's like as if somebody will throw a magic boomerang our competitors won't sell anything, markets won't move governments won't intervene, consumers will customers will still be loyal staff will still be here and so on And in the time the boomerang is whirring around we can do things to the company We can plan for turnover we can manage our staff we can and so on Unfortunately, uhm that 's not always possible, In fact some people say it 's not, it 's impossible, given the dynamic that is the environment in which people operate So for instance, if we take ninety-six FM, they introduce new programmes, new uhm jingles, new competitions all the time on a running basis, so clearly they are planning these things somewhere while the programme goes on They don't stop for a day to say, there 'll be no radio tomorrow because we 're going on a staff development exercise, or we 're going to introduce our Budweiser World Cup competition so we need a half an hour to get it together and record it Somebody is doing all that So in other words the counterpoint is that you can manage because, what you do is you separate the planning function, from the doing functions In, as organisations get more complex and more large, people are removed planners are removed from the doing, because they need to plan The problem is in very large organisations, they get so removed they forget who they 're planning for Which is one of the criticisms of the analytical planning approach, as you know from strategic management So these are just four ways of looking at what we 've been talking about up to now, In other words there is more than one strategy So if we contrast this as we try and do every week in our with our own situation, you are clearly not being employed <unclear> two words </unclear> dependent on the buyers ' market for labour In other words you will see a job posted, it will be part of a recruitment strategy for company ABC Limited and you will apply You will send in your bog standard CV, even though Tim said don't do that, and you 'll get a letter saying thanks but no thanks And you 'll wonder what the hell happened and you 'll say, whoops, it 's a very soft labour market, it 's a buyer 's labour market Nothing to do with me and my CV or the fact that it 's just the same as all all other Commerce students in Ireland, despite <unclear> 2 words </unclear>  Then you ring up your uncle and you get a job, in the company where he 's the boss, or your mother gives you the job or whatever, That can be scratched from the tape It 's a very cynical approach No Tim What we do is, we realise that in fact the buying of labour is just one of the strategies available, and that there 're other ways, of doing things, maintenance growth and selling The problem is these all other three depend on you being in the organisation, So we 've talked about job strategies before Anyhow that 's the model Do we have, do we want two seconds to take anything down, we 've all taken down Good Right In the Irish situation, there are a number of fundamental things happening, or, that are the case regarding the Irish, market for labour, the Irish labour market, where these buy and sell and grow and maintain positions are taken", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0afd57e0-7029-47ba-b9bc-a6b716e6fa89", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.354361+00:00"}
{"text": "<Latin lecture>\n\n\n<$A> Now the Latin text of St Mark 's Gospel, uh which we are reading in this course, uh is taken from what is known as the Vulgate <&French> La vulgate <&/French>, in French obviously Uh that is that is to say the Vulgate edition of the Bible, in this case, uh the New Testament Uh now the term \" Vulgate \" is borrowed directly from the Latin <&Latin> vulgata </&Latin>, which is the perfect participle passive, a feminine of the verb <&Latin> vulgo vulgare </&Latin>, to publish, to make public, or to make available to the general public, you see You know the noun <&Latin> vulgos </&Latin>, which means the general mass of ordinary people, the common mob as, uhm, Horace calls them  The reason why the feminine form <&Latin> vulgata </&Latin> is used, is that it agrees of course with the word <&Latin> editio </&Latin>, understood, <&Latin> vulgata editio </&Latin> That would be the full title, strictly speaking, but, uh, for the sake of brevity, the word <&Latin> editio </&Latin> is omitted, and so in Latin we speak of the <&Latin> vulgata </&Latin>, and in English the Vulgate Now, I 'd like to point out that the term \" Vulgate \" applies not only to the New Testament, some people uh have the idea that it applies only to the New Testament, but it also applies to the Old But in this class, in this course, uh we are only concerned with the Vulgate New Testament, or more specifically, with the Vulgate text of the Gospels Now the Vulgate text of the Gospels is essentially, uh, the correction and adaptation of an existing text in the light of good Greek manuscripts, That 's what the Vulgate means It 's essentially a correction and adaptation of an existing text in the light of good Greek manuscripts And this correction and adaptation was carried out by St Jerome, in AD three eighty-three, to three eighty-four AD three eighty-three to three eighty-four, at the bidding of the Pope of the time, Pope Damasus, D-A-M-A-S-U-S Pope Damasus Damas I suppose it could be, would it Tomorrow in fact eleventh of December is his feast day as it happens yes Uh Jerome anyway was born, uh about three forty, and died in four twenty Three forty to four twenty  And he was secretary to Pope Damasus, and at the time he was the foremost uh biblical scholar in Rome You may ask why did Pope Damasus feel that this revision was necessary Well, he felt it was necessary uh, because of the ever-increasing number of variants, in the manuscripts of the Latin Bible All sorts of people were making their own translations you see And so uh, they were very many variant forms of, uh, the Gospels say or indeed of the Latin Bible in general Now though the remaining New Testament books in the Vulgate have often been attributed to Jerome, the extent of his influence on those books is not clear We 're clear about his influence on the Gospels but we 're not clear about the extent of his influence on the other books of the Vulgate, that is to say the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles, and the Apocalypse Very well, now the text which Jerome corrected and adapted is essentially, sorry is generally referred to uh as the Old Latin Text Old Latin in capital letters you see Although no manuscript contains the entire Old Latin New Testament It 's it 's not in any single manuscript, The term Old Latin versions then, refers to the Latin versions of the Scriptures used in the Western Church, uh before the introduction of the Vulgate of St Jerome, The need, of a Latin version of the Bible was felt, earlier in the provinces of the Roman Empire than it was, uh in Rome itself Because at Rome, Greek was better understood and more generally spoken, Uhm there 's some indication of, such a version in Gaul about the year AD, one seventy-seven And we we certainly know of the existence of a Latin version in Africa, as early as, AD one eighty And when we speak of the Old Latin text, what we are really talking about, is a great variety of versions, you see Uhm, and a distinction is drawn between the African version, and the European version, uhm, which was an Italian version known as the <&Latin> Vetus Itala </&Latin>, the <&Latin> Vetus Itala </&Latin> Uh it was called the <&Latin> Vetus Itala </&Latin> because St St Augustine discovered it in uh Milan, in the fourth century But recent research, suggests a third Old Latin version, this is Spanish And so, uhm to some extent independent of the other two, Now all of these Old Latin versions are from the Greek I 'm speaking now of course, about the Old Testament as well as the New because the New was only in Greek, was originally written in Greek, but of course the Old Testament was originally written, in Hebrew at least most of it was written in Hebrew, and then translated into Greek, and then translated into Latin And, these old Latin versions, are written in popular Latin, Latin that was suited to the uneducated or lower classes for whom they were intended And for this reason, they are linguistically important, for the study of the evolution of the Latin language The first Vulgate bible was produced by Gutenberg at Mainz, in fourteen fifty-two, I might mention that, when St Jerome 's Vulgate uh was first issued, uhm it was met with a storm of protest People didn't like it They they were they preferred their old the older version they were accustomed to The same has has happened to some extent or not as uhm, uh well, the protest wasn't as strong but  uh some people don't like the our modern versions of the Bible Some are wedded to the older versions like the King James version, and so on and perhaps the same in French, you know Uhm the Jerusalem Bible for instance was very much criticised, you know, when it came out first I rather like it as it so happens, uh Particularly the notes the footnotes in the Jerusalem Bible are really superb, you know Now so much for the Vulgate then, I just want to say a few words on St Mark 's Gospel which we are directly studying this term Uh in early times Mark was, uh neglected among the Gospels And the reason for this is that he was regarded as being merely an abbreviator of St Matthew But, since nowadays, the vast majority of Scripture scholars, even among Catholics, accept the view that Mark is the earliest of the synoptics You know what the synoptics are The Matthew, Mark, and Luke are the three synoptic  evangelists, because they, uhm contain more or less the same material or are parallel, you can study them in parallel Uh St John 's Gospel on the other hand is not one of the synoptics because he is quite different both in his content and the organisation of his material So uhm, since Mark is now regarded as the earliest of the synoptics, the study of Mark, has come, to hold a central position in Gospel research, You see it 's on Mark, that Matthew and Luke build, and it 's Mark whom they interpret, you see So to do a serious study of Matthew and Luke, it 's necessary to begin by comparing their Gospels with that of Mark So that among other reasons is why we have chosen to do, take Mark as uhm our text for this term  Now a word about the authorship of the Gospel, of the so-called Gospel of Mark The tradition of the Fathers of the Church, you see, agrees that this Gospel was written by Mark the follower of St Peter And, we may interpret this traditional connection of Mark, with Peter in this sense,  that although they did, the material uh didn't derive from Peter, the Gospel circulated in the churches under his patronage as guarantor of his message In that sense you see That the Gospel circulated in the churches under Peter 's patronage as guarantor of its message Now the question arises where was, St Mark 's Gospel written We can't say precisely where it was written, but what we can say, is that it was written for a gentile community, for a gentile community, of the Roman world, outside of Palestine somewhere outside of Palestine some would say in Rome itself But at least it was a gentile community, uh somewhere in the Roman world, outside of Palestine As regards Mark himself he was a man of, little culture as, culture was then understood, for his Greek you see is essentially uhm a non-literary Greek, not very polished, uh full of uh roughnesses, of style, and full of Semitisms You know that word You can understand yes\n<$B> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$A> Hebrew indeed, and Aramaic He would have spoken Aramaic, which was a later form of Well it was a later dialect a Semitic dialect Uhm it was the kind of Greek which might have been spoken by the uneducated classes of Rome, you see Uh because as you know, uh in Rome there were many Greek-speaking slaves As I 've said earlier, the first Latin uhm translations of the Bible arose in Africa, not in Rome, for the simple reason that in Rome, Greek was very widely understood There were there was a big, Greek-speaking population there, and, the Romans, at least the better-off Romans, had their  their uhm children educated by Greek slaves  Now just a final word about the theology of Mark, uhm the overriding or the main emphasis in Mark is, to present Jesus to the reader as the Son of God That 's the key expression the Son of God Whereas in Matthew, Jesus is presented as the Messiah The Messiah fulfilling, the hopes and prophesies of Israel Because, St Matthew 's Gospel, was directed uh, more to a Jewish public Some would say in fact that, uhm Matthew 's Gospel, was originally written in Aramaic, but that 's a matter of, dispute among scholars Uh in Mark, the the Messiah, the Messianic aspect of uhm Jesus ' mission is less developed Uh and an aspect which had more obvious relevance to the gentile world, is given greater prominence It would mean more for example to gentiles, to the Greek-speaking world, to speak of a Son of God They could identify with the idea of God and Gods and so forth and a Son of God uh would have meaning for them uh whereas Messiah wouldn't And hence the title \" Son of God \" if you have noticed, uh appears in the very first verse of St Mark 's gospel in of chapter one, and again at the very end when Jesus dies, chapter fifteen We 'll look at it in a moment, Chapter fifteen, verses thirty-seven and thirty-eight When the centurion says, you remember,  surely this man was the son of God , or  was a son of God  Again that uh phrase is, uh, the subject of dispute Now this recognition of, the divine identity of Jesus is the first move in the spread of Christianity to the nations, to the gentiles you see The phrase, \" the nations \" in the Gospels and in Scripture generally, uh, is often translated as \" to the gentiles \" <&Latin> Gente </&Latin> is the Latin word you see, that 's the word that 's used for the nations, <&Latin> gentes </&Latin>, and it had that specific meaning for Jews The non-Jews were the <&Latin> gentes </&Latin>, or the gentiles <&Greek> Ethne </&Greek> would be the Greek word The word which you have in the, expression \" ethnic \" So those are just a few ideas to put you in the picture first about the Vulgate, and secondly, about St Mark 's Gospel And it 'll make it more interesting I hope, uh, when you, are reading the Gospel itself, you will see, uhm something of the situation in which it was written and in which it came down to us in Latin Right now where were we the last day down there at, chapter one, verse nineteen I think", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d4ddff41-d0d3-40c0-a5d7-306f9e68d06e", "added":

you should know What is the, what actually is application software How would you describe it\n<$E> Uhm the the uh the software that carries out the different tasks\n<$A> That 's right Application software uh enables the computer to carry out a specific task, as opposed to system software uh which is the operating system Okay So application software,  enables the computer to carry out a specific task Okay So as Madeleine mentioned there, we have different types of uh different programmes uh which come under the heading  of application software We 've word processing, spreadsheets, database, accounts, stock control, payroll, et-cetera These are all known as business applications Okay Business applications, Now again under the heading of application software we have uh what is known as package software, application packages which can be bought off the shelf Now these are programmes that uh are used by uh the general public if you don't need a special programme to carry out the work for you Okay So that is known as uh uh application packages,   Now as well as these application packages uhm we have special-purpose software Okay Special-purpose application software Now this is software, application software, which is specially written to suit the needs of a particular company Okay Specially written to suit the needs of a particular company Now large, we 'll take large manufacturing companies that uh have we 'll say integrated software especially, uh to meet their needs That means that some of the application uh programme or software enables the computer to uh cover the task in hand from the time the raw material will come in the door to the time that the manufactured product goes out the other door So every entry that was made uh using that software will update different files Okay So this type of software is specially written because the needs of companies vary from one company to another Okay That is special-purpose Okay Now we 've dealt with the uhm word processing, okay So in a nutshell uhm Anna, what are the basic features of a word processor\n<$F> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> So what kind of editing have we Madeleine\n<$B> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> insert\n<$A> Right, okay\n<$B> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> copying\n<$A> Right Copying Right And uh also what other features have we Madeleine\n<$B> Spellcheck\n<$A> Spellcheck Right\n<$E> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Now what about formatting Formatting the document Pam\n<$G> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> So what is involved in formatting our document\n<$E> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> What does formatting a document mean Anybody\n<$E> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> That 's right Setting margins, top margin, bottom margin, left and right Okay Setting tabs, uh setting the size of the page, centring, all that, involves formatting the document It 's the layout of a document Okay Then we have enhancements as well, which uh Noreen Enhancements\n<$H> Bold\n<$A> Bold print, that 's right Jenny Underlining\n<$I> Italics\n<$A> Italics That 's right So there are of the Yes Olwyn\n<$J> Increase the size of it\n<$A> That 's right, the size of different fonts Okay Now always remember that if you change the  the size of the font you must have a printer that is going to print it out successfully Okay Some printers uh uh will not print it out Okay So you that 's something that you need to watch But generally in business if you are doing that kind of work you will have a printer that will print out your different size of fonts Okay\n<$E> The uhm actually the printers over across the way don't <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> don't\n<$A> Well any dot matrix will Unless that the program is, the the actual file is missing off the program Okay Now we 'll take WordPerfect for example You, within the WordPerfect programme you 've different files that control different actions Okay Like for example printing out different uh size uh fonts, underlining, bold print, et-cetera Different printers you 've a file of printers so WordPerfect controls it as well as the printer Now if you have a dot matrix printer, most dot matrix printers today will print out the large font You mightn't get the quality To get the quality you need a  either a laser printer or an inkjet Okay So uhm that is another feature of word processor and then of course, uh Breda, anything else\n<$K> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Yes well <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> cover that now Now any other features now apart from these editing uh features\n<$E> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Yeah a word wrap yeah that is Word wraparound is automatic carriage return Okay So all word processors have that Now we have of course we 've mailmerge uh for standard letters and then we have which we went over the last day with uh standard paragraphs which is known as collating or document assembly Okay Now uh document assembly is the construction of one document from a number of standard paragraphs Now these paragraphs are stored Okay They 're stored either in a separate file, some word processors have what is known as a library, other word processors have uh what is known as a glossary Now there are two meanings to the word glossary A glossary can be uh like a dictionary to explain different terms You get a glossary at the end of your book But a library for stored paragraphs is also known as a glossary Okay So uh these uh frequently used paragraphs are stored in we 'll say a glossary,  or, a library Now, if your word processor hasn't a glossary or a library you can use a different directory for these stored paragraphs You can make a directory to put these paragraphs into Now that is the way you organise your files, especially in business where you are using a hard disc and all your programmes are in different directories They 're in sub-directories Okay Now you can have a sub-directory for your documents, for example all your letters and your reports et-cetera And to distinguish, we 'll say, between reports and letters depending on the type of business you have you can put an extension onto the end of the file name Now as I said before uh a file name contains uh a maximum of eight characters You cannot have more than eight characters in a file name Plus an extension of three characters with a dot between them Okay So if you want to identify any, your documents in their own directory you could give them a name, and put in your dot, and give them a three letter extension, okay, to identify uhm your document, whatever that may be You can  uh you could devise or in a company these would be standard Okay These would be standard practices, and of course then for your standard paragraphs, your frequently-used paragraphs, they could be in a directory of their own Okay And of course they could have uh the their extension as well Now uh another day I will uh go through uh the directories with you As I said uh previously we 'll do that on the computers themselves because in theory, it 's difficult to understand them unless you do them So uh we 'll do that on the machines Okay Because there is always a path leading to a directory Okay If you have, we 'll say a letter, in, we 'll say a document directory, you could make a sub-directory called a document directory, well you 've to go through the path to lead to that directory if you want to call up the  the directory to see if a certain document is there So all these uh sub-directories lead from the root directory through another directory, we 'll say through WordPerfect onto a document directory and on through to we 'll say uhm uh paragraph directory you could call it paragraph or something like that, okay So that 's uh uh uh a job for another day We 'll do it on the machines, okay Where you 'll be able to understand it better Now, again with the application software I think we 've covered uhm most of the features We covered them the last day anyway uhm as well as the word uh processor we have uhm the spreadsheet Now we should all know what the spreadsheet is Jenny would you describe what a spreadsheet is\n<$I> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Now I 'm here Jenny and you 're there, I never heard of a spreadsheet, okay So you 're telling me now what a spreadsheet is If you could describe it clearly What about you Noreen\n<$H> Uhm it 's a it 's a sheet with rows and columns\n<$A> That 's right Yeah\n<$H> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> do whatever you want with\n<$A> What kind of things would you do Noreen\n<$H> Uhm analyse the trends or <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Yeah uhm Belinda, have you anything to add\n<$L> It 's a worksheet that 's done on a computer <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$A> Right, yeah And\n<$L> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> give you results, you can draw graphs, pie charts, and stuff like that\n<$A> Right there 's something very important uhm something important that we 're forgetting\n\n<$A> Yeah the computer calculates automatically, and at the end of the day, because we are using formulas, okay, this makes it possible to change any figure within the spreadsheet and any total that that figure will affect will change automatically, that is the power of the spreadsheet Now uhm before we had computers and before we had electronic spreadsheets uh these spreadsheets were done on a large sheet of paper They were ruled down uh vertically and horizontally and at every intersection a box was formed Okay Now you can think of that box when you move the cursor in your spreadsheet it 's like a little box Okay So at every intersection a box is  formed and this box is known as a cell Okay Every cell has a reference, okay, which is known as the cell address And when you enter figures into a cell uh and calculate them afterwards, you use a formula to calculate, but you just specify the cell address You don't ever refer to a figure You actually calculate the contents of these cells So this is what makes it possible to change a figure uh that will automatically change the results Okay Because you 're asking the computer to calculate the contents of the cells, not the figures, not the actual figures, the contents So whatever you put into these cells is going to be calculated If you change the figure, the your results are going to change as well So that is the power of the spreadsheet, okay It 's known as the what if question What if this should happen What if the price of uh we 'll say petrol went up during the coming six months What effect would this have on our business So, if a company are using a spreadsheet to uh budget, we 'll say for the coming six months, and they think that they they have their spreadsheet done, then they hear that the price of petrol is going to go up The price of petrol is going to increase the price of transport and that is going to affect other uh other areas of their company, okay So they change the figure for transport for petrol That changes the figure for transport and any figure any other figures that that will affect uh will change automatically So as you know already from doing the spreadsheets yourselves you only put in the initial figures All totals are calculated automatically by the program or by the system Okay So that was the spreadsheet Now you can see, well I think everybody here knows what a spreadsheet looks like but read into it, if you are asked questions on a spreadsheet you must be able to answer them clearly Okay You must be able to define what a spreadsheet is, what it does, okay, and also the power of the spreadsheet Why we use a spreadsheet Okay So think of these questions in your own mind Uh what is it Why do we use it What is the purpose of it What does it do Okay So think of all these questions that could come up Okay Who uses a spreadsheet Okay The features of a spreadsheet So again we all know that, we know that uh the text is known as labels, figures are uh are known as values, and then of course like the word processor we have editing features as well Okay Now there 's no need to go into those because we 've been doing those uh for the past few weeks", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9269b536-338d-48ed-a136-2d81156afbba", "added":

{"text": "<Novels>\n\n\n<$A> Uhm now let 's look at this novel as the as the last one that that we 've looked at Uhm well he says that he 's trying to discover something about the twentieth century, but he sets it, in the, the early part of the nineteenth century, and he also sets it in Lyme in Dorset uhm which just happens to be where he lives, but, perhaps more importantly is the scene of one of the major uhm actions in Jane Austen 's Persuasion uhm so, where there there is an incident that takes place on the Cob at Lyme So that John Fowles being the kind of very uhm, you know very self-conscious novelistic novelist uhm probably intends his readers to uhm, you know to remember what happens in Persuasion and to compare what happens in his novel with it You know Because this is very much the kind of novel which constantly in in a very post-modern way constantly comments on its own processes, doesn't it I mean you 're reminded all the time that you 're reading a novel and he discusses the, you know the difficulties of, of dealing with characters and dealing with time and dealing with, with all of the other things Now uhm some people argue that it works extremely well Right, I don't know do you think it it works extremely well Other people I have to say get annoyed with Fowles because he 's one of those, those novelists who puts in uhm quotations uhm usually in the original language and he doesn't translate them, you know I kind of say, if the purpose of uh literature is communication to use a very old-fashioned idea, uhm then if, you know if if you don't translate things, are you really expecting a twentieth-century audience to be able to to do all this translation for you and also to have this whole weight of reference Now Fowles was very much influenced by Flann O'Brien, oddly enough, but you recognise his uhm his uhm, his influence and I don't know if if if you remember in, or if you 've read At Swim-Two-Birds Anyone read At Swim-Two-Birds At one stage in At Swim-Two-Birds the the the narrator who 's a student uhm very much like Stephen Dedalus and if you remember Stephen Dedalus in Portrait of the Artist produces his views about art, his aesthetic, and this student produces his aesthetic as well about the novel that he 's writing, and he says the modern novel should be a self-evident sham And it should be largely made up of quotations from other people 's works, and this will preclude illiterates and persons of inferior education from the knowledge and understanding of modern literature Now in At Swim-Two-Birds, it 's comic, but there is the question about all of these kinds of novels these say, self-reflexive novels uhm where they are they are obviously self, they are self-evidently shams, because on the one hand you 're being told a story, you 're being drawn in to try to uhm understand these characters, you 're being presented with a theme We said that the major theme was uhm his uh choosing freedom which is a typical Fowles theme Uhm but at the same time you 're you 're you 're being told all the time this is only a story, that I 'm telling, and it 's got three different endings Uhm now perhaps, do you want to say what the three different endings are or even something about what happens in, you know in in the novel\n<$B> Well one ending is where uhm, he 's daydreaming and he thinks that he 'll marry Ernestine and he give uhm Sarah up, and the other one is where he uh gets together with Sarah and they get married, and the other is where they part  basically\n<$A> Yeah Well I mean, think about those those kinds of ending I mean endings of novels, beginnings and endings are always very uhm very important in in in novels and this one I said has three possible endings It also has of course uhm a whole panoply of footnotes, doesn't it And and the footnotes come from uh various texts about Victorian sexuality, which showed that underneath the the you know the surface of conformity there was a vast underworld of uh prostitution, uhm venereal disease, and so on and so forth Uhm so that you 're you 're being you 're being shocked out of your uhm your suspension of disbelief You 're drawn into the into the story in all the conventional ways and yet the possibility of three different endings and these, these footnotes are meant to constantly remind you that this is this is a fiction, this is you know a literary construct with all of its own rules, so that you are not meant to suspend your disbelief Uhm, nevertheless the endings uhm propose conclusions in uhm ways that are uhm more or less conventional because quite often people get very unhappy about the endings because, you know they want the story to end in a particular way Now most people do not  I mean this is a story about uhm a very ordinary, in some ways, uhm young man, uhm who has some of the the doubts that were prevalent in the Victorian period, partly because he has travelled, and also because he 's interested in prehistory There 's a whole series of novels now about the effect of, for example, the discovery of the age of the earth uhm during the Victorian period Uhm I can think of two uhm that you might like to look at One of them is Graham Swift 's uhm, I think it 's called Ever After, uh which starts up with somebody, basically digging out the skeleton of a dinosaur out of a chalk cliff, and what it serves to do is to completely disrupt their notion of society, time, permanence because, you know the  the  the whole thing, and it it it causes the the person who does it in that novel to leave his wife and children Because suddenly in terms of the vast age of the earth, all of the smallness of their lives and their endeavours, particularly their commercial endeavours, seem very very petty And the other uhm one is uhm by Peter Ackroyd, uhm and it 's called First Light, and again it deals with with the the notion of somebody discovers an ammonite, and in in fact it 's uh it 's set around people who are trying to excavate a Neolithic uh tumulus It 's also set in Lyme, as it happens, so it 's quite a-propos of this Uhm but but close beside uhm the tumulus is an  astronomical observatory so that you have both, kind of going out to the stars but also digging down into the earth, and then people picking up ammonites which are you know fossil creatures off the seashore and somehow trying to look at ordinary human time as compared with star time uhm and and time way way back into, you know into Neolithic uhm things and you look at that that whole notion of time and change and in that the question of, where do human choices matter You know So that that Charles wants uhm a kind of freedom, but he has to realise that this has all sorts of social consequences Now he 's been slightly disturbed by the the various things, you know the various discoveries that he 's made, but nevertheless he he you know he thinks he 's going to settle down and make a good marriage uhm in which he has to present himself as a good prospect and uhm to somebody who is fairly conventional, Ernestine is fairly conventional, but he also sees and is attracted to this Sarah figure who stands initially at the end of the Cob of Lyme uhm you know uh she 's an outcast and people are talking about her You know she 's the French lieutenant 's woman or the French lieutenant 's whore as as they say Uhm and she has told this story about herself that she has in fact offended against every convention of the time Now as it happens our main surprise in the book is that she hasn't, uhm but that she is deliberately putting herself outside of society as a way of trying to get some sort of freedom as well Uhm now the the the the three endings are that that that Charles will leave his infatuation for Sarah and marry Ernestine and settle down with the the conventional Victorian thing uhm or that, he will somehow,  you know having looked for Sarah for a couple of years, that, and having found her again, that he will, you know, set up with her in some way, or that they will both recognise that uhm their association with each other has allowed them to make the kind of choices that define themselves, in you know in an existential sense and so they have become separate beings rather than being simply the creatures of society, and that it is not therefore necessary for them in conventional terms, you know to marry, to live together, to to have to have children Now I don't know in in terms of reading the book but I think most people want uhm Charles and Sarah, to get together, and this is the ending in, uhm, you know in sort of conventional romantic terms So it it again this is this is a reader response novel, you know where the reader is meant to get implicated and and by showing which way they want the book to end uhm almost defining themselves Now as I say some people like that, but other people dislike it because that kind of choice is burdensome It 's also disappointing if you have the idea that the story tells you a story that somehow encapsulates the kind of reality, and one of the arguments about the novel one that that that I that I ask you to respond to is that uhm it is satisfying, not insofar as it reflects life which is as messy, troublesome, difficult uhm undefined as Charles experiences it, but precisely because it has uhm an ending uh because it has shape, because at certain stages in it there are crucial moments which are recognised as crucial, where you know where choices can be made and things can be, can be shaped so it that it is precisely the shape of the story uhm which is different to the life we lead That that you know it 's precisely for that that people read the novels Now I don't know what do you think about that\n\n<$A> On the other hand uhm, you 're presented with a story and you 're presented with an ostensible theme Now the notion of theme is that this novel is about something So we have this dual thing, on the one hand it 's saying it can't be about anything, because it 's just a story and any one story is as good as any other story And you just know that you 're telling a story and and, you know it might almost be in sort of in Beckettian terms, that one is as good as the other to pass the time But certain things in it imply meaning They do imply meaning So that there 's a tension going on uhm because here are characters in a search for meaning That that that kind of of tension exists Uhm a lot of people like Fowles 's novels uhm, particularly because they seem to be about people at crucial moments of of choice I said you know that you know that this is certainly uhm, even if the, the choices are, you know, even while they feel that that they have no choice because they 're actually conditioned that it is necessary for people to feel that they are able to to choose things and have control over their over their own lives uhm except usually in his novels he sets up a whole series of things that You know somebody thinks they 've made a choice and then in fact find that it isn't You know it 's not a real one and you have to kind of keep on uhm doing you know doing that uhm At least if if you don't sort of respond to the story, you can respond to the condition of making choices I mean do you think that you have choices over your own lives\n\n<$A> What are what are the big the big choices that people make I mean the big choice in this novel is is who he 's going to marry uhm And the society in it is is presented as being far more repressive than uh than society today would be uhm So that in some ways everything is laid out for him and there are sort of proper choices and there are improper choices uhm for everybody And the consequences of making what society considers to be an improper choice is going to be social ostracism probably poverty and certainly having to as, you know Sarah has to listen to Mrs Mrs <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> uhm who is absolutely convinced that she is right about everything uhm and because she has money and because she 's able to employ somebody as a servant, feels that she is able to have total control over her every movement", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9f32d90b-a717-44b2-8c9f-5fcf245c4ef0", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.357333+00:00"}
{"text": "<Education in Irish>\n\n\n<$A> Uhm I, I work in <&Irish> Institiuid Teangeolai/ochta E/ireann </&Irish> uhm, in Dublin, And most of my work in the last, twenty years or so, has been uh, a lot of my work has been on Irish in Primary School Uhm, I did a series of surveys on, standards of Irish in the nineteen eighties,  late nineteen seventies nineteen eighties Sure Uhm, uh I did a series of surveys in the nineteen seventies and nineteen eighties on Irish in primary school uh and looking at various, variables as well that affected the standard of Irish achieved and so on, uh and in the nineteen nineties I did uh an in-depth study, of, uh the teaching of Irish, teaching and learning of Irish, in a very small number of, schools which were representative nationally but in which I was able to do much more detailed work because we weren't trying to cover so many schools, uh, and this year we 've done, uh, we 've repeated a survey we did in nineteen eighty-five, uh but on a much bigger scale in the sense that we 've far, we 're collecting a much greater range of data, uhm uh from the pupils themselves about their views on Irish <unclear> several words </unclear> information <unclear> several words </unclear> from the parents how they see, uh, the Irish language and how they feel about it being taught in schools and, what kind of supports they give to their children and what kind of, attitude to Irish they they try to develop and so on And we 've we 've we 've done that survey in in ordinary all-Irish Gaeltacht schools, uh we have a steering committee Jacqueline is one of the members of of the steering committee in fact And, uhm I won't be talking about that survey because we haven't analysed the results yet, but I 'm also  working currently on an evaluation of the modern languages in private project and that report 'll be out shortly I 'll just give you that to, tell you what my background is But what I 'm going to be talking about mostly is, uh, the detailed study that we did in in the nineteen nineties uh because, I I 'd like to make a make a point about assessment I 'm I 'm going to take the word assessment to mean something quite broad, to include, not just assessment of sort of, terminal achievement if you like in the classroom or or classroom assessment by teachers, but to include uh uh you know the evaluation of programmes, uh, language books uh evaluation of uhm, initiatives uh and uh the, interpretation and implementation of the findings Uh the the general point I want to make is that, I believe the kind of work we did in this particular study I 'm going to be talking about, that the approach we adopted is very valuable That is, uh we we looked at, uh, the complexity of learning Irish, we didn't just look at the achievement of the pupils We looked at uh, their own individual opinions, we we uh we studied the class using trained observers, uh what was happening and and so on We got the views of the parents So, I think we 've quite a rich set of data And as a result of that, we did uh a number of development projects One of these was to develop a communicative approach to teaching Irish, uh uhm, if you like, a a trial course, uh, for teaching Irish which took account of our findings the kind of things we 'd found in what I call the Twenty Classes Study the in-depth  study And uh we also went on to develop a content-based approach to teaching, uhm, science and art again which we felt was the gap in the programme And we are currently working on uhm, a programme for for pupils which provides a  direct road and link, for parents so that if the pupil does something in school but has to go home, and do something with the parent and then go back to school, as it were with some information or with some task done So, I 'll explain why why we did things  that way My my general point is that I believe that, collecting rich data, going to the trouble of getting a range of instruments, building up the instruments, collecting rich data, and linking research, and development, is a very productive way to proceed And I suppose, my general argument would be that, I think that 's what that 's what should happen at a national level in the sense that, beyond our particular research work, research and development work, that, we we should, be looking way beyond the school all the all the time but trying to bring the world outside into the school if you like, and look at development projects which, uh, which will link, the world outside the school and will in some sense try to find solutions to problems, that children encounter in in in making sense of Irish in in valuing it in uhm, if you like, in in seeing it as being an important thing to learn and so on So I I 'm talking about ordinary schools by and large even though we 've looked at Gaeltacht schools and all-Irish schools as well But, the work I 'm going to talk about here is, work which looked at at ordinary schools for the most part Uhm, just looking at our our theme in general uhm, uh politics and, uh uh and language,  there 're obviously loads of connections like, in the case of the kind of work I 'm talking about uhm The, at the first level we 're looking, I 'm talking about, a rich view of the classroom in the sense of a view which takes account of what 's happening outside, and the difficulties for pupils of seeing the relevance of Irish Uhm, so if in that sense, politics with a small P sort of like, the position of the language, the fact that Irish is a minority language, uh whether parents are supportive of Irish If they are supportive of Irish the extent of which, they, if you like, communicate that to the child in terms of, how enthusiastic they are about the child 's success and achievements and so on So politics <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> if you like, impinges on, the work of the school particularly in the case of Irish but I think in the cases of of lots of subjects but particularly in Irish Then there there 's secondly, there 's if you like, and of course assessment is terribly important there in, capturing the full complexity of the picture, not simplifying it, not looking at just methods within the class and so on, not looking at teaching methods, and teaching approaches but the whole complexity of of learning and the challenge it poses for the child Uhm, the other side of politics is I suppose, all  all primary school subjects all school subjects have a political dimension in the sense that, how well children do, is of political importance If children are failing at science for example which is an issue at the moment, in schools in the Republic, uh if children aren't choosing science, you know it has political implications If science is not taught well it has political implications If children don't learn to read in their native language successfully, it has implications for poverty and social exclusion and so on So, there 's that kind of reciprocal thing And in case of Irish of course, there is the big political question that we have, a major national aim to promote the wider use of Irish to, try and achieve bilingualism and ultimately achieve, as it were, the full revival of Irish So that 's there, again as a job for assessment to  communicate what 's happening in the schools, to to the public and the politicians as it were And thirdly, the politics intervenes in the sense that, we 're looking at how successful, uh uh are the structures and institutions, how successful are are are are the politicians, the powers that be as it were, in providing supports, structures, appropriate, programmes uh to support the learning of Irish So, at all stages, we 've politics in there and we have assessment at the centre or evaluation if you like, communicating, between these different domains So, if I could just look quickly, at, what I think, uh this is the Twenty Classes Study I was telling you about The the data we 're collecting, this this year will bring, this data up to date but I would suspect that a lot of what I 'm saying here will turn out to be, as it was, uhm  when we did the study Uhm, the, the Twenty Classes Study is was a research study, a detailed research study, and these were development projects which grew out of it and tried to respond to particular problems identified in it The Communicative Materials Project, these are communicative materials which are still in use in the schools, widely used in the schools because, we still don't have, as it were, uh, uh courses from the publishers, well we we are now getting them finally, but uh there 's a new revised curriculum, for a communicative approach to teaching Irish Uh and we were asked to do the sort of prototype lessons if you like to illustrate how it could be done And we used the information we got from the study to tailor it as best we could to what we felt were the needs of the school This was a programme where, we established, uh, in a number of these national surveys that that, classes which had been taught parts of some subjects through Irish like like, music or uhm, PE for example, would be taught actually through Irish or partly through Irish had a much higher standard of achievement in Irish So if you like, it 's a it 's one form of content-based teaching that that kind of teaching as far as And these were ordinary schools And these schools were almost halfway between what the regular ordinary school would be, what an all-Irish school would be And we thought that, there there was the anomaly that even though we had these results and we 'd broadcast them quite a few times, there were no proper, materials which would make it easy for, uh a teacher to teach through Irish So, we knew that, science was going to be a new primary school, subject And we we we shortly before it came in we developed, a special course in Irish which would be tailored to uhm, ordinary teachers in ordinary schools, who hadn't previously taught through Irish We wanted to make the point that it was possible to train, ordinary teachers to teach through Irish So we did a project which was very successful Uhm, we we we simply contacted teachers we we knew about, who who would be prepared to do it Not all of them were necessarily hugely enthusiastic Some of them were, others were not particularly, they were prepared to give it a try And we developed courses in teaching science and art through Irish for third and fourth <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> And that was tremendously successful in the sense that, we showed it could be done, that the teachers were very enthusiastic about it They did have some reservations about  certain aspects of it But what we did is,  we if you like, we did a little bit of the work for them, we made it easy We we designed the lessons We gave all the vocabulary items needed, at the beginning of the lesson We gave, the phrases they would need We laid out very clearly what materials they would need and so on Now the teacher had great flexibility to use that in any way they wanted but, we had done a certain amount of, the kind of dog work if you like, for them And we subsequently published these uh uh, these books and they 're they 're they 're selling reasonably well", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fe095195-85ce-4320-87e6-930857b3360b", "added":

{"text": "<Language education>\n\n\n<$A> When I was asked to speak I had a bit of a dilemma because, I didn't know exactly whether I should speak in Ulster Scots or in Irish so I decided I 'd speak in English  So I 'd like to begin by, uh, the, topic I 've taken is, the, teacher education for teaching through a target language And I suppose I decided that, I would focus, situate it in the context of, uh, general teacher education, because in fact, for teacher preparation it is a very very uh complex field From my particular experiences that I 've been working in teacher education for, thirty-two thirty years which is a long time in different areas I first worked in, primary teacher education and then, the Irish government took a very intelligent decision and asked me to work in secondary teacher education They closed the college I was working in,  Carysfort College So that uh, over the years I 've been in a lot of schools watching people, teaching, evaluating their teaching, uh seeing how they 're making progress I 've evaluated Irish language teaching, geography teaching, various things that I knew, nothing about but nevertheless that 's the, the context of primary teacher education And in fact, at the moment uh, the whole area of  of teacher education particularly at primary level, it was mentioned earlier today the great shortages of teachers at primary level And you have a kind of a crisis management situation In, the British Isles and in the Republic we have, new forms of teacher education where we have graduates being converted, in a very hurried way into being primary teachers in short courses et-cetera so that uh, there is there are difficulties generally with teacher education And there 's quite a lot of, work going on in attempts to reform the programmes But, what we 're all, I suppose, I will speak about the various approaches, which uh, in different ways are, available in the area You first of all have the old approach the, they used to call it sitting with Nellie, where somebody sat in the back of a class and observed what was happening and, became an apprentice to a teacher It 's a it 's a craft model which, in fact is gaining a certain amount of prominence, particularly in Britain, more partnership between the schools and the universities and the colleges of education In fact uh in many cases this can become very excessive, especially if it becomes very bureaucratised The next one is the  competencies model, where you say, well these are the things we want teachers to be able to do And again this is a fairly limited approach Uh the reflective practitioner, as Hitler said when I hear the word culture I reach for my revolver, when I hear the word reflective practitioner sometimes, I want to know what people are at  Uh basically, we 're supposed to reflect on our own, performance, and thereby, after many hours of meditation come up with, uh improvement But again it 's very much part of nursing education, teacher education, you reflect, you keep a diary, you improve and it does help at times And then you have the technical rationalists, applied science, approach, which is the one really that, in a way is the ideal that people would study Whatever they think about educational psychology <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> pupils, they will study, approaches to, language teaching, the basics of linguistics et-cetera <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> language teachers They would in a sense bring a scientific approach, to what is an art You have the art of teaching and you have the science of teaching Now, people like, uhm fairer teacher trainers or teacher educators have to, pay attention to both, not just one Now, within the Republic, and I suppose in many other places, we have, uh different forms of preparation for different levels The  and, I suppose we have to make a distinction between training and education It 's a very critical distinction Uh training teachers is one thing It 's very much, a bag of tricks They 're able to perform They 're able to manage a class They 're able to, to but educating teachers is quite a different And I often feel that, when I was, uh growing up, we had a name for a teacher, we called him the Master Now he wasn't a just a master for nothing He was a master because he was an educated person, who had a lot of knowledge and who he was a leader in his community Now in many cases that 's not happening now Uh again, training for bilingual teaching or teaching through the target language, it is a very complex issue because you have students, who are, as was mentioned this morning, at various levels, of development in the language which they 're inclined to be You have the native speakers in your class and you have people who are coming from homes where English is the language, and you have people of different levels of intelligence So it 's not an easy task Uh the varieties of learners and learner contexts Now, within, the organisations which prepare teachers you have the institutional frameworks, the colleges of education, universities, the B-Eds programme, three-year programmes, sometimes four years, PCGE, H-Dips And then you have, different language teaching institutions and then you have voluntary bodies who prepare Another important aspects of preparing for language teaching is the ongoing, in-career or in-service, professional development of teachers and this can take place, uh, through the State The  the State in the Republic is very remiss In fact have recently, uh withdrawn some monies that were supposed to be provided for in-service education And it 's a vital area in the ongoing professional development of teachers, whether they be language teachers or history teachers or whatever And then, quite uh effective in many cases with regard to, modern languages as well as with regard to minority languages are the professional subject organisations We have for instance <&Irish> Comhar na Mu/inteoiri/ Gaeilge </&Irish>, the Irish Language Teachers ' Organisation which has a major publication <&Irish> Teagasc na Gaeilge </&Irish> and is a very valuable contributor if only it would have enough members If only the gospel, went to a lot of people Now I 'd also argue indeed professional preparation of teachers, of language that, the whole area of applied linguistics, has a vital, uh role and, as was mentioned earlier this morning, there is need for ongoing research Very few of us know what is actually happening in the language classes, whether it 's modern language classes, the Irish language There is very little observation data available, through research There 's uh also action research as I say Teachers working, I had a student recently who did a, very nice action research uh piece of work on, using the concept of multiple intelligences for the teaching of Irish in a disadvantaged area in Dublin And it was most interesting to see how she set out her her research proposal Now like any profession, quality, how do we achieve quality We were speaking this morning about a shortage We were talking about standards versus people actually being there Uh, there is a shortage of Irish language teachers, in the Republic particularly at second level It 's one of the areas, I know that in our department we 're allowed a quota I think it 's fifteen, Now we could manage forty-five, but the State has a limit on the number of people that can actually train, in particular areas of the university Within the, teacher training colleges as we used to call them or colleges of education, access, up to a number of years ago, was in a sense, both on the basis on exam results and on an interview For financial reasons the interview was abolished with the result that there, there is very little control, really of the access It 's purely on the basis of how many As or Bs or whatever you get Personality and other factors which are very important in teaching are not taken into, account So that within that process you have the initiation of people, the qualification, and then the actual specialisation as they go through the profession Various forms of, mentoring are being introduced, which are highly significant, induction programmes, and then at primary level the State oversees the first year teaching and register teachers, or doesn't register teachers depending on their Now with regard to, three basic requirements, for anybody hoping to teach through the target language, a high degree of confidence in the  in the target language That will usually be achieved, through the language departments, either French, German, Irish or whatever or, with, people who have native speaker confidence, uh <&Irish> o/ dhu/chas </&Irish>, from birth, Now within the concurrent, teacher preparation programmes, everybody that 's in the Republic and wants to be a teacher has to, uh attend, quite a significant number of programmes, which would give them a certain competence, but, motivation is low among the, in many cases And sometimes, a professional programme which is a short type of programme doesn't give the confidence, which would be adequate to teach through Irish in a, in a, an all-Irish school for instance And another factor that uh, I suppose in many cases in teacher training militates against, uh, quality is the fact that the academic department, in a university or in a college of education, has a much higher status, than the methodology area I think that would be granted, and research has shown And that has an effect, on the the ways people give  attention to methodology Now one thing that 's coming through in the research throughout Europe is that, the actual classroom skills, in using the target language, are essential, and that we don't pay enough attention to that area Now, uh, a high degree of confidence in classroom skills and in language teaching methodology that is an absolute <&Latin> sine qua non </&Latin> in teaching through the target language, And uh, the reality on the ground is that, it is difficult, to find enough people who have the combination, a good subject qualification, particularly at second level To find a combination of somebody who 's highly competent and proficient in the language and also has a good subject qualification let 's say in geography or in history or in science And then, there is a certain dearth, particularly in scientific subjects, of texts, which are not just translations, let 's say in the sciences I was talking recently to a headmaster in an all-Irish school, biology, physics et-cetera, great difficulty in that sense finding textbooks, that are adequate, Now, there 're courses throughout the European Union which are dedicated to preparing, people for teaching through the target language, whether they 're teaching English in, Holland or, German in France or whatever Uhm, okay another point I want to mention is the, significance of placement Sometimes we forget, that this, idea of placing, probationary teachers, trainee teachers, in schools, and the types of schools in which we place them, and the degree of care which is necessary uh, to take with students make, sure that they 're placed, where they get support et-cetera, is quite important Now part of, training for teaching through the target language is, let 's say, dealing with, uhm materials development, adaptation et-cetera so that, the actual people who have come through courses will be able to involve themselves in curriculum development development of materials There is other things motivation techniques Uhm, what else have I down there Uh use let 's say of, all the modern, technological resources which are available, the video, interactive video, internet et-cetera which are becoming available and which in many cases are being used but, not very frequently Now, just to go back to where I started What is, or what constitutes teaching through the target language And I 'm going to, put an overhead shortly And I think I 'll get a bit of grace Uhm, what is teaching through the target language Uh I have that here on, let 's say a recent publication which comes from, the university of some place I can't pronounce in Finland", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "af9932e2-92ce-4193-a6cf-f11bbbc842eb", "added":

{"text": "<Geography data>\n\n\n<$A> So we need a better way, a more straightforward way, of answering probability questions when we have normal data which you may have in practice which has some mean and some variance and some standard deviation And in order to talk about this we have to talk about something else And I 'm actually going to leave this sitting on the blackboard there and now we 're going to talk about something else We 're going to talk about, you can write this down, data transformations, data transformations Now what is a transformation A magician throws a whole lot of cards into a hat and then pulls out a rabbit The cards are turned into a rabbit after the transformation Changing something into something else And just as magicians turn people into rabbits and rabbits into cards and cards back into people, and all of the rest of it, we can change numbers and we can do things with numbers And in order to see what we can do with numbers and what might happen when we do things with numbers let 's take a very simple data set In fact let 's take a data set that we talked about at the very beginning of the course Let 's take the numbers one two three four and five Now there is a data set and let 's consider the properties of that data set Suppose I plot that data set out on a diagram, suppose I plot that data set, suppose I plot that data set out on a scatter diagram, what will I get What I will get, this is the number of observations up here, what I will get is in this data set I have one value of one, one value of two, one value of three, one value of four, and one value of five Very good Is that data normally distributed No way It 's evenly distributed between one and five It 's actually the integer value, and the integer value, and evenly distributed or uniformly distributed between one and five What is the mean of that data set I 'll assume it 's a population of data What is the mean of that data set The mean of that data set is obviously two and a half or three and a half No the mean of that data set is three James can't add or subtract which is why he teaches statistics as you 've learnt already The mean of that data set is three We also work out the variance of that data set We actually did this away back in about the second lecture and when I worked out the variance of that data set, take each reading, subtract three, square them, add them up and divide by the number of readings is five, the variance you may recall came out to be two And therefore the standard deviation of the square root of two which is one point four two, to two places of decimals So there 's the properties of our data set It 's uniformly distributed, this particular data set, it has a mean of three, it has a variance of two and it has the standard deviation of the square root of two which I think to two places of decimals is one point four two maybe one point four one but not to worry Now I 'm going to start doing things with this data set And the first thing I want to do to this data set, to turn it into another data set, is I 'm going to subtract the mean from each reading Now the mean is three so I 'm going to subtract three from each of these readings and then I want to look at the data set that I get So, subtracting the mean from each reading, so I will write minus mu up there to show what I 'm doing One minus three is minus two Two minus three is minus one Three minus three is zero Four minus one is plus one, that 's four minus three is plus one and five minus three is plus two If I subtract the mean of my data set, if I subtract it from each reading in turn I get another data set which happens to be these five numbers here And indeed if we just go back a little bit, when we started to calculate the variance, this is actually the first thing we did, when we were calculating the variance, take each reading and subtract the mean Then we went on and we squared these and added them up and divided by the number of readings So in a way I 've just started doing the same thing as before Anyway we have taken each reading and we have subtracted the mean So in each reading here is X I where the first one is X one and the second one is X two the third one is X three and so on as, we discussed before Our new data set here is each X I, subtract from it mu And here is my new data set And I want to ask, what are the properties of this data set Now first of all, if I plot this new data set out as a scatter diagram what do I get I need to put in here minus one and minus two And my new data set looks like that Those purple Xs And the question is, how is that new data set distributed And the answer obviously is, again it 's uniformly distributed In fact the way in which it is distributed its shape is exactly the same as before What I 've done graphically is I 've taken this data set and I 've <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> each of the Xs over to the left by a factor of three So this one comes over here, this one comes over here, this one came over here and so on So if I subtract the mean from each value in my data set I do not change the shape of my data set I move all the readings by a certain amount but I don't change the shape Second of all, what is the mean of my new data set The mean of my new data set is obviously zero The data readings in effect are now centred over zero So if I subtract the mean, if I have a data set and I subtract the mean value from each reading I get a new data set and obviously the mean of that new data set is zero because all the readings have gone down by whatever the mean is Three What is the variance of this new data set Question How spread out are these purple Xs relative to how spread out these white Xs are Answer Exactly the same They 're spread out to the same degree While I 've moved all my readings three steps to the left, I haven't changed how the purple Xs are and I look at the purple Xs how they 're spread out relative to each other, how they 're spread out around their central value which is zero, is exactly the same as how these readings are spread out around their central value, which is three And indeed we calculate the variance of these values take each reading and subtract the mean, the mean of course is zero now, square them and add them up You 'll get four plus one plus zero plus one plus four which is ten and divide by two divide by five the number of readings We finish up again with two And therefore standard deviation, maybe I just should check this I I need this a little bit later Look at this Look at this There 's organisation I actually remembered to bring a machine today to do some sums Now One point four one four Okay I 've changed my mind The square root of two is one point four one to two places of decimals, so again the standard deviation here is one point four one So what have we proved so far If you have a data set and you subtract the mean of that data set from each reading in that data set you get your new data set, your new data set will, a, have the same distribution as before, b, the mean of your new data set will be zero and, c, the degree of spread in your new data set will be the same as before whether you measure that spread by variance or standard deviation Very good Now I 'm going to do something else I 'm going to take each of these readings in this data set that I have created from my original data set and I 'm going to divide each of those readings by the standard deviation Okay Now my standard deviation here is one point four one and this didn't change as I came over here So I 'm going to divide each reading in my second data set by one point four one So basically, therefore, what I 'm calculating over here on the right is each reading subtract the mean, now that 's what went on as we went from the first column to the second column and now, to do a further transformation I 'm going to divide each of these readings by the standard deviation which is one point four one So what I will get here is minus two divided by one point four one, minus one divided by one point four one, zero, one, divided by one point four one, and two, divided by one point four one And when I work out what two divided by one point four one is I get one point four one, over here, one divided by one point four one would be half of this which would be zero point seven zero five This is zero, this would be uh, sorry that 's minus one point four one, minus one point point seven zero five, this would be plus zero point seven zero five and this would be plus one point four one So if I take each reading in my middle column and divide by one point four one, the data set that I now get is this data set Minus one point four one, minus point zero seven five, zero plus point zero seven five, plus zero point zero seven five, and plus one point four one And now I want to ask, what are the properties of this data set, and of course each reading has originally come from, has been derived from, one of the readings over here First of all, what is the shape of this data set And let 's plot it out I have a reading of zero and I put the Xs up here so that we can compare Now, the first reading over there is minus one point four one so I 'll plot out about there The second one minus point seven zero five isn't that what it was Yes Zero, plus point seven zero five and plus one point four one So those red Xs simply plot out graphically, are a graphical representation, of those five numbers we had derived from these five which came originally from these five Now, we are asking, what are the properties of this data set Question What is the distribution, what is the shape of this data set Answer It is still uniformly distributed data It is evenly distributed, the readings come at even intervals this time over a scale of minus one point four one to plus one point four one but the shape is still the same You have five readings which are evenly spread, one following the next Second question, what is the mean of this new data set Answer, the mean of those readings is zero These red Xs are still centred over zero The mean is zero What is the standard deviation of these readings What would we expect the variance or the standard deviation of these readings to be", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Programming>\n\n\n<$A> We 're using the Mac uh OS Ten which is available on all the Macs around college now although I don't think it 's working very well just yet, uh because the installation isn't quite right Nevertheless uh, I 'd like to just say something about it because most of you probably  haven't used it First of all OS-X or OS Ten, to give it its proper title is a new uh uh operating system for the Apple Macintosh Now new being it 's about a year and a half old, it 's about a year and a half out there uh in its first final version Now the thing about it is that it 's based on Unix Now Unix goes way back to the seventies Okay it 's based on Unix and the the variant of Unix that uh it 's based on, literally based on, is called Darwin Now this is an Apple computer, it 's an Apple made for a variant of Unix that 's based on uh a free version of Unix called FreeBSD Okay and if you 're a Unix head uh it 's FreeBSD four point four that it 's based on It 's it 's extended in the direction of the Mac uh the nice Mac graphical user interface It 's extended in a number of uh nice ways which we don't have to worry about We 're not concerned with them at the moment So you have this operating system that 's based on Unix It 's got a nice uh graphical user interface a nice GUI, as we call it, called Aqua, uh and then underneath that is Darwin, or underneath it is Unix And we 're going to have a look at it in a moment because you can actually get at this underneath part of the uh Mac operating system through an application called the Terminal which gives you a standard Unix access to the underpinnings of the of the computer system And uh I 'm going to try and do that in just a moment, If you 'd just bear with me for a moment, Uh <unclear> several sylls </unclear>, do a couple of things I don't want you to see, Now, It 'll just take a second to come up, Okay Now, when you go to the Macs in the in the uh east end or anywhere else you 'll have to fish around for this program And the way to do that is to open a new window, a new Finder window, and go to the Application Book Right From the Applications Book and you 're still not going to find it, you won't have as many programs as this now but you 'll have a folder there called, you see it there, called Utilities And in the folder you 'll find a program called, Terminal Terminal, okay Not because it 's the end but because it imitates a machine that used to be called a terminal, an old kind of box with a a screen on it which you could put text only, not graphics, just text on It was an old style, you 'll see them in the movies still, the old style terminal with the green characters and all that kind of stuff It imitates that pretty much Now you 'll see that I have uh, on this machine that, my own machine here, I have put an icon of the Terminal on the thing here, the Dock, right You can do that if you want I 'll get rid of this one first just to show you It 's gone, right And I bring this one over and put it wherever it is I want it And you should be able to do that when we get the Mac OS Ten set up working properly in in the college, it should be able to retain those preferences Anyway, you can double click to open the terminal Okay so here you have what you might call a command line interface, CLI to the Unix part of the Mac You can actually edit away your own little Unix programs your own little C programs there if you want Okay so if you 're a Linux person or if you 've used Unix before in some way then you might be comforted a little bit to know that underneath this very nice and very swish user interface there 's Unix underneath there for you to to play around with And we might have an example in a moment of actually using Unix directly for our for a, for our work Okay so the Terminal window then gives you access and you can do things like you can list the file, you can uhm, what else can you do Ah you can do lots of things you know Trust me on that one Okay, just go back to the PC here for a moment, if it 's still there Okay So you can access then Darwin as I said here using the Terminal application, Okay, Darwin, that 's the Unix part, the underneath part if you like It 's the latest of of uh Mac OS Ten It has a fairly complete set of Unix stuff in it In particular, what we 're going to be interested in, it 's got a fairly complete set of Unix tools Now Unix is the, and Linux, which is a copy of Unix, uh they 're both uh hackers ' dreams or geeks ' dreams because there 's lots of stuff inside them that you can play around, lots of tools in there that you can manipulate and use to do various things, writing programs and debugging programs and all that kind of stuff But specifically the things that are in uh Darwin that are commonly used are C-compilers, C-plus-plus compilers, and I think I mentioned the last day another variant of C called Objective-C, uh these compilers are in there, we 'll be using C-plus-plus compilers There 's a debugger to help us visualise what the program 's actually doing and thereby debug it, get the bugs out of it Uh there 's a Make utility uh which is for constructing the set of commands needed to to compile a program and actually run it Uh it 's a standard Unix thing and then there are Text Editors, uh notably VI and EMax EMax is very old, EMax goes back to the late fifties or the early sixties I think it is Uh VI is a bit newer, uh but these are old-style text-based uh text-oriented editors for people who consider themselves to be professionals Now what 's really fantastic about these and geeks is that uhm there 's lots of very arcane commands that you have to remember to make good use of VI and EMax And of course if you happen to know those commands and remember them then you 've got this skill that maybe not many other people have so you could show off a little bit That 's the only way I can explain their continued use Okay Cos I don't like them I think they are too hard to follow, too hard to use but you can use them if you want You can use them if you want And I 'm going to actually use one now, uhm just to show you how you would use all these things Just very quickly And I 'm not recommending you use them But if you 're if you 're, if you want to be more comfortable thinking that the Mac has got a fairly standard set of tools based on Unix then this is an example of it Now just let me go back to the to the Mac here Now what I 'm going to do first of all is I 'm going to create a file of uh a tiny little program, just that same little program more or less that we had the other day Okay And I 'm going to use the VI editor to do that Okay so I 'm going to say I want to visually edit I think that 's where the VI comes from visual, VI, visual editor uh and remember this was developed away way back So I 'm going to edit up a little program called uh Sample Uh yeah yeah that right yet, Sample dot and I 'm going to put this CPP which stands for kind of C-plus-plus That 's the extension that CPP Uh, so again an empty screen and it says, I don't know if you can see it at the bottom, uh it 's a new file we 're on line one at the top those uh tildes or squiggly things there, they 're tildes and they just indicate that there are no lines in the file there That 's just as it were blank space So I 'm now going to put in this program And I have to remember to use the the letter A I 'm sure you can find lots of manuals on VI or EMax if you want, and I 'm not going to attempt to explain how to use them uh because we 'll be using the uh the uh graphical user interface version of all this But just to show you So I 'm going to say I want to include, so I 'm just writing this program I-O stream, you remember that from the last day Uhm we have a program called main, a function called main, which you will take Now I 'm going to leave out the arguments here You remember I said you need two arguments In fact in some variants of C-plus-plus you don't Okay so I 'll just leave it out for the moment, open bracket, I 'm going to say I want to leave the tab there I 'm going to C out Hello world Well hello people in the MacNeill where we still are today Okay go onto a new line That 's backslash end there Okay End the quotation, end the statement semi-colon right Uhm return, zero, semi-colon Okay End of program Escape out of that in text Exit the program Okay so I 've made the program up using the VI, using the the visual, one of the standard editors in uhm in uh Unix Okay Let 's actually make this program Now, what we what I 've actually written here is I 've written the source code that is I 've written the C-plus-plus code and that has to get uh processed so that it turns, it gets turned into a piece of machine language that the computer can actually execute And the steps under, they 're actually detailed in Deitel and Deitel 's book but the steps are that your program, the text of your program, is said to be compiled into what 's called object code Okay so the text of your program is compiled by a compiler, that 's a program It 's compiled into object code and then this object code is linked with a whole lot of other pieces of object code to produce machine code, a machine code file And that machine code file is executed Okay so you go from the source code through the compiler to object code through the linker to a file of machine code And then you execute the program by telling the Unix system to run the file that contains the machine code Now just let me go back to the linker The linker links the object code that resulted from your source code being compiled to lots of other object code corresponding to programs that your, that the piece of code you 've written may rely on For example this program here relies on the C out facility Actually I 've made a mistake I 'm going to have to just go back and edit that Uhm it relies on the C out facility and the code that implements the C out facility is part of what 's called a Library and the object code for that Library gets linked to the the object code from my uh source code when it was compiled The whole thing together becomes the uh the file of the machine code which we 're going to execute I 've made a mistake on this I should have put STD-colon-colon in front of the C out So maybe I 'll just edit it up now and fix it So I go into VI, what did I call it, Sample dot CPP, okay I 'll just go down and I 'm going to insert STD-colon-colon That didn't quite work out the way I was expecting So I 'll insert a tab and I 'll just go up and remove the tab from there Okay it 's really, it it 's not too bad after a while, right but but learning the commands for moving around and inserting text and removing text and all that kind of stuff it takes a little bit of uh, well you need to have a reason for it basically So let 's see, make I 'm going to make Now the make utility that I mentioned in my uh slides there is a standard program that 's available to most Unix systems which will analyse the program that you 've written and it looks particularly at the extension Do you remember we called it dot CPP It looks at that and it uh it tries to work out from that what needs to get done to turn your program into uh machine code okay To compile it, to link it, to save it in the save the machine code in a particular file and then uh to do all that So I 'm going to say make sample, Okay and here it 's after listing the command that it 's executed", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "<Sixteenth century 1>\n\n\n<$A> Nobody can afford to govern independently of the great Anglo-Irish houses And the first person to experience this dilemma was the person who welched on the Kildare Pardon in fifteen thirty-seven, Lord Leonard Grey or Poor Leonard Grey as he began signing himself self-piteously uh within a few weeks of his appointment to office Think of the situation that confronted Grey when he took up office, A lot uhm he had to assume responsibility of the government of the entire island and Cromwell gave him a massive, massive army, a Tudor juggernaut of conquests that amounted at the very most to guess what, Five hundred men You know uh, a little more than uh O'Rourke had, a little more than O'Reilly had, but less than  considerably less than what both of them had together and nothing compared to what O'Neill of, O'Donnell, and Desmond had And in fact he never really kept <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> because letter after letter came from Cromwell asking him to reduce the garrison and by fifteen thirty-eight do you know what he had Two hundred and fifty men Anybody who thinks that the Tudor conquest started in the fifteen thirties has to take into account this scale of failure There just is no force there And just as Cromwell from the safety of Whitehall was insisting that his Irish Lord Deputy maintained this piteously small garrison, so he was also intervening in Irish affairs regularly in a way that he wouldn't have interfered with Kildare back in the fifteen twenties How Seeking appointments of his favourites to office, uhm asking critical questions of his conduct, listening to criticisms arising from Kildare 's own English, sorry I should say Grey 's own English councillors in Dublin, people like John Alen, people like William Brabazon, who were running a kind of Underground Railway back to Whitehall telling Cromwell all the bad things that Grey was up to considering Here is an English Lord Deputy, unknown in the country, who was now forced to govern in the country with a piteously small force, and who doesn't even have the same kind of authority amongst the English in Ireland than Kildare would have had That 's the first of his problems There 's another problem too They hadn't gone away you know Sure, the House of Kildare went, sure, uh the Earl of Kildare himself died of sickness of heart in the Tower of London and his son and five of Lord Offaly 's uncles were executed at Tyburn in the summer of fifteen thirty-seven And a few other unfortunates were dragged out and hanged drawn and quartered in Dublin itself But that 's the limit of it They didn't destroy the entire Kildare alliance They didn't even destroy the entire Fitzgerald of Kildare family But all over the country, amongst the O'Connors in Offaly amongst the O'Briens in Clare or Thomond amongst the Devlins in Munster, and amongst the O'Donnells and the O'Neills in Ulster All the members of the old O'Neill  of the old Kildare alliance remained untouched They 'd taken the head off the hydra if you like but the body remained intact, and very upset So all over the country the new English <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>, had, to deal with a highly unstable, volatile, potentially hostile political faction That 's another of his problems The third of his problems and it mightn't seem like a problem at first sight but you 'd want to be fairly thick not to see it as so There were people who were willing to help out Yes indeed He was not entirely without friends Indeed, leaping to his aid in fifteen thirty-seven, there were of course the ancient rivals of the Fitzgeralds of Kildare, to wit, the old enemies, the Butlers of Ormond Don't worry about it We 'll do it for you We know exactly what you need to do in Ireland and what effectively you need to do in Ireland is hand over the reins of power to us We will, we suggest that you conquer the midland Irish We suggest that you invade the Gaelic Lordships of South Leinster And I know you can't do it but I 'll tell you what, we 'll do it for you Uhm we 'll lead developments What seemed like an offer of support was really a takeover bid So here 's the situation He doesn't have an army, he doesn't have money, he doesn't have the kind of respect amongst his own councillors that Kildare would have had He has an extremely angry and unstable Geraldine alliance all over the country to deal with and the only people who 've offered to help him are people who want to subordinate him to their own factional agenda Over to you folks, Given the circumstances What would you do\n\n<$A> Oh there was a way out He did it He made peace with the enemy Not the Butlers, but with the Geraldines And in fifteen thirty-seven for the first of three perambulations of the country Grey moved south and made his peace with the greatest surviving remnant of the Geraldine alliance, with James Fitzgerald, claimant to the earldom of Desmond He 'd no right to it The Earl of Desmond uh the real legitimate Earl of Desmond was skulking in Whitehall uh but James Earl of Desmond or James the claimant of the Earl of Desmond refused to recognise him And you know what The English Lord <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> said that 's fine with me <unclear> several sylls </unclear> And on the basis of that renewal of a Geraldine alliance with a key member of that alliance, Grey succeeded in opening doors all over the country With Desmond 's support he moved westward and northward into Ulster, signing indentures with old Geraldines left right and centre, assuring them that, ah what had happened at Maynooth, unfortunate accident, fit of pique don't you know, and he had no further intention of attacking the Geraldine group and that if they only would do one little thing, if they only would uhm surrender, to his person, the surviving heir to the House of Kildare one Gerald Fitzgerald half-brother to the Thomas Offaly who 'd been spirited away by the Geraldines from Maynooth upon the capture of that castle, if they would just see their way in handing him over everything would be hunky-dory He made no further move, no further attempt at confiscations, no further attempt to arraign people for trial for treason Now look at the advantage of what this What he 's done is he has exploited the vulnerabilities of the Geraldine group, they need him And the fact  that that he was indeed related by marriage as a brother-in-law to Thomas Lord Offaly, nevertheless he had him executed The fact that he was related by marriage to the House of Kildare, that he could claim to be Geraldine by alliance at any rate helped him in this way He made his peace and they offered him two things They offered him first of all entrance They weren't going to cause all that much trouble for him Uh at least in the immediate future They offered him leverage through the country It was Desmond and Desmond 's allies who gave the bodyguard, who gave the safe passage, who arranged the movement of the Lord Deputy and his momentous troop of around two hundred and fifty men, around the country without any embarrassing hiccups And in this way Lord Leonard Grey managed to constitute the first English viceroyalty in Ireland as something of a figure in the land Okay That 's what he did and that enabled him to cope with well you know the lack of men, the lack of money, and the dangers of Geraldine instability But it had its downside, notice Any suggestions\n\n<$A> Very very cross indeed And by the end of fifteen thirty-seven, James Butler, heir to the House of Ormond was shrieking that My Lord Deputy is none other but my Lord of Kildare born again, that he was in effect a Kildare replacement And there were other people dissatisfied with what Kildare, with what Grey had done as well The English councillors, both the English Irish who 'd been the authors of those reform tracts I spoke about yesterday and the English-born administrators who 'd come with Grey to Ireland who 'd expected to be getting a piece of the action in the place once they arrived, and had expected at the very least to be treated as superior to the defeated Geraldines, were deeply disappointed indeed And they too in the person of the people like William Brabazon and John Alen, the Lord Chancellor, uh began complaining mightily to Thomas Cromwell and to Henry the Eighth of the treasonable goings-on of their own Lord Deputy And by fifteen thirty-eight this combined register of complaint of the House of Butler and of the English councillors within the government administration issued in the establishment of one of those most deadly instruments of Tudor rule, a commission of inquiry In fifteen thirty-eight Grey had to face a commission of inquiry headed by Sir Anthony St Leger, with two other figures William Cavendish and Thomas Minn who came to investigate a whole raft of things but especially Grey 's conduct in regard to the Geraldines and in regard to the Butlers And they held open sessions and they heard all kinds of evidence and Sir Anthony St Leger took all the evidence carefully and it is preserved and it is a deadly indictment, the kind of thing that would nearly send somebody to the block It says that acting ultra-vires acting beyond his powers, the Lord Deputy had actually recognised as an earl somebody who was not the legitimate heir to the earldom The Lord Deputy had waived those to the uh and pardoned, waived the charges against and pardoned those who had been involved in the Kildare Rebellion and that the Lord Deputy was making his own private treaties with Gaelic Irish Lords to wit O'Neill and O'Donnell Serious stuff isn't it, And in, fifteen thirty-eight after the uh close of their enquiries they, commissioners return with a big sheaf of material which they presented in whole to Thomas Cromwell Deadly stuff You know what Thomas Cromwell did with it What did Charlie Haughey do with the uh Hamilton Report, the Beef Enquiry Put it on a shelf, forgot about it And Thomas Cromwell, between fifteen thirty-eight and fifteen forty, said nothing about it at all Why\n\n<$A> Yeah I 'll tell you what This guy 's cheap You know This guy he 's not costing me any money There is no trouble I 've got enough troubles of my own handling this king and the one thing that I do know about Ireland is that it 's not giving me grief at this moment So the St Leger report stayed on the shelf Now there was a further problem afflicting poor Leonard Grey He 's one of the few people whose self-pity I do actually respect And the second problem was that the Geraldine alliance was of course a matter of convenience They didn't like him, they didn't trust him, they knew what he had done in regard to the Kildare family itself They needed him but if they could get in a chance of moving beyond him they would And a key element in this was a refusal of the Geraldine alliance the Geraldine league, to hand over the surviving heir Search where he would for him Grey could not find him And matters became a little more tricky when the heir 's mother, Eleanor Butler Countess of Fitzgerald, did a very brave thing She conducted a diplomatic revolution Now hitherto, the principal  allies Ulster allies of the Kildares, a big Ulster Kildare axis, was founded on marriage agreements, several marriage agreements, of the O'Neills of Tyrone with the Fitzgeralds of Kildare Con Bacach O'Neill the chief of the O'Neills married into the Kildare family and even more than that had been recognised as a liege You remember I was saying to you last time round that uh one of the ways in which you could cease to be the king 's Irish enemy and become the king 's English subject was to get a grant of denization <unclear> several syllables </unclear> and was legally regarded as an Englishman That kind of alliance <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Con Bacach uh had been uh cool about the rebellion Sure he 'd come down and rattled his sabre and uh and burned fields in the Pale when the rebellions broke out, but once the heavy guns came in, once the ordinance was moved in and once Maynooth got shelved he went oh but this wasn't supposed to happen at all at all, and, on Desmond 's advice in the later fifteen thirties he had uhm, he had made his deals, he had made his deals with Grey And it was to break up this realignment that Eleanor Fitzgerald had moved You know what she did She got married And who did she marry She married Manus O'Donnell chief of the O'Donnells and the principal regional rival of the O'Neills of Tyrone", "subdomain":

{"text": "<Fellowship group>\n\n\n<$A> We 've had uh we 've had something humorous already That was very humorous the way it turned out, so humorous it became Uhm Jan came to me and asked would it be okay if she were to do a recording And I, you know the way you get kind of dreams and hopes,  thinking I 'd be going live or maybe on a recorded disc to millions of homes and that it would sell big, but then she said it 's just for the grammar and intonation So it 's like life itself really one minute you 're on cloud nine and the next So that 's while I kind of pursue the notion in practice that so much of our culture if you call it that is is visual and image counts for a lot I sometimes am afraid it might even count for more than words, not tonight of course but you know what I mean,  Now, he 's uhm he 's an ecumenical <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> He was gotten on the Shankill Road When Clonard was being renovated, it 's finished now I suppose how many months, nearly a year, a, year, some of us were living in St Clements on the Antrim Road, and travelling back and forth, so I passed a shop called the Juke-In, there 's a name, just at the corner of Ainsworth Street And they have various types of ornaments even out at the front of the shop So I always wanted one of these So I became the proud possessor And having become the proud possessor he was sitting on my mantelpiece and I was looking at him and he was looking at me Now the linkage of sorts came in the, in giving thanks to God There are many things we could give thanks for, for his goodness, for the fact that he created us, all that, all of his creation But for the ordinary things, I think there are things we actually don't name very much and don't think of very much, and should be and should be thanking God for, all the elements of creation like for instance sport, like humour And uh humour, it 's been often said that around here humour has been a safety valve which has gotten people through many troubles and difficulties and I think there 's, I think there 's a great truth in it So I used him when preaching in the church\n\nThank God someone remembers  Yeah People still inquire as to how he 's getting on I bring him out now and then, give him a trial But there 's, we say our thanksgiving prayer with Mary our Mother, at the end of the Novena, we thank God with Mary for all the graces, the blessings and so on that God has given us And one grace and blessing he has given us I think, is humour So thank God for that There 's a great psalm too and uhm, a great psalm of thanksgiving which I 'd say we know pretty, pretty well  My soul give thanks to the Lord, all my being bless his holy name, my soul give thanks to the Lord, and never forget all his blessings, the heavens are high above the earth, so strong is his love for those who fear him, as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our sins, the love of the Lord is everlasting on those who hold him in awe, he has set his sway in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all, my soul give thanks to the Lord  So it 's in that kind of, I suppose context really, thanking God for His gifts, that I would say these few words about humour I 'd be fiercely interested if, you know if there were, and there possibly is, I haven't gotten around to studying books but some, some analysis then of how humour actually gives us a view and puts us in touch with reality Part of our day-to-day reality is I think is we 've become serious and sometimes too serious about many many things We feel for instance very often that we 're controllers of our own destiny We 're in charge Foolish notion that is And there 's a sense in which humour I think teaches us <unclear> several sylls </unclear> to dissect them or to say what 's what Or humour, we can all say we 're talking about good humour, I suppose <unclear> several sylls </unclear> It it it separates us I think, from viewing reality as in our particular kind of domain or control It separates us from taking things too seriously in that sense, that we 're actually in God 's hands We are His creation, His beloved And humour 's you know, in that, from that point of view, giving us that kind of separation, giving us, humour gives us a better view of reality I think, which is more in touch with reality Talking about humour and putting us in touch with reality, one of the incidents in, when the Troubles were at their height, I remember walking from the monastery here, I was going over Dunmore Street, which was there then, won't be there too longer, it would certainly be a different shape, anyway, they 're building there at the moment And there was this man, a bomb had gone off, and he was nailing his front window He was putting up boards or something And as I passed I stopped a moment and I looked up and and he says to me as he looked down, he says, do you want a hammer, for him to to you know jump in and help him And I thought that, you know, a very, a very humorous thing for him to say In the midst of uh what was a tragedy really, I mean well, I mean how many people if they 've got their front window blown in would think it was the worst calamity since the Titanic But here was he, hammering away, serious matter for him, but yet he was able to notice me looking up and thought of course wrongly that I had time on my hands, and inviting me to join him in in this, repairing his house The uh separation, humour can come to us too in the separation of uh that we mightn't take ourselves too seriously There was a an incident here in the, in the monastery not so very long ago, where it didn't kind of I suppose redound to my glory but then as I often say as long as the glory goes to God in the long run Martin Cassidy, one of our communion was celebrating his Jubilee, as were, were a few people, a few <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Martin wasn't one, a few, four <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> celebrating jubilees of various sorts So there were individual sort of, Ronan O'Dowd asked some of us to give a  few words There were about four celebrating jubilees, there were four of us chosen Martin Cassidy who 's what seventy, eighty and uh hard of hearing and his health isn't good He was sitting, and it was my turn, I was talking about Tim O'Driscoll who was celebrating the Jubilee, and Martin was kind of sitting there listening, half listening I suppose, you know he really is fairly deaf <unclear> several sylls </unclear> So I thought, I was giving what I thought was a very fine speech I was second on the list, there were at least two more to come So I was second on the list So there was I speaking away, and reaching a very climactic point in the address, and I allowed a pregnant pause, and Martin Cassidy from the side, everyone, I included, could hear, loudly and clearly saying, who 's next  I thought it a terrible interruption I was just getting into the last that important part of the little speech but I never, never quite got there I was stopped in my tracks, Uhm, last, last week, two of us were in Portglenone We met Andrew Maxwell, a minister in the First Presbyterian communion for a bit of a get-together And I was telling a story from the pulpit, well story <unclear> several sylls </unclear> about these group of people down by a riverside and they were being baptised by being immersed in the water And this character who 's drunk happens to wander in to the company and the preacher says to him, have you found Jesus And the man says, no, I haven't So the preacher gets him they 're all looking on and praying on his behalf and the preacher dumped him into the water Have you found Jesus And they pulled him, no, he says So down he goes again this time for a longer time They haul him up Have you found Jesus now Your man says, no I haven't he says, are you sure this is where he fell in , There are one or two accusations that would hurt me deeply, one I suppose would be to say if people said I was pious and the other would be if people were to say I was just an entertainer So the point of telling that story actually was to say, as I did after telling the story, that those of the Reform churches are right, and they would say that Jesus saves us We can even maybe joke about you know sometimes about the kind of extreme preachers that go around and are talking about Jesus saving us and all the rest of it But, the truth is there It is part of our faith, our Christian faith we 've been saved by Jesus Christ So I went on you know not very beautifully on that point  <unclear> several syllables </unclear> Cos really , I 'd say that 's about all I have to say  I 'd be fiercely interested too again in a kind of , what do you call it psychological analysis of the value of humour in, say preaching I think there 's a powerful unanalysed value in the kind of telling of a joke for instance even before, you know in a sermon The the effect it has in relaxing people, again maybe the effect of, of the reality of the scene, of not, taking our own selves too seriously, whatever value I think is amazing an amazing thing I often kind of marvel at the effect that humour has on a group of people But those are few, my few rambling words", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "bfcc4258-be1a-41e7-ad2b-76dcfa655968", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.363275+00:00"}
{"text": "<Sixteenth century 2>\n\n\n<$A> You will be my protector You will be the principle Geraldine defender from now on thus embarrassing Con Bacach who 's very displeased by it Had to get tough Had to show form And what he did was begin raiding the Pale again So even as Grey was fending off these allegations of corruption and indeed of treason he had to cope with the fact that the Geraldines were themselves, turning against him in one way or another But upon the shelving of that report and when the news began to seep through and actually all that talk of the Butlers and all that talk of people like Allen Brabazon and <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> wasn't getting anywhere, Grey decided to get tough He had a hosting in the Pale This is the first time that he 'd really demanded military service from within the Pale Got a hosting and moved fast against Con Bacach O'Neill Took him by surprise, on the borders of Monaghan in a place called Bellahoe Not Bellaghy We don't know exactly where Bellahoe is <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>, and inflicted the first major defeat, by an English force on, a Lord of Gaelic Ulster since since the time of Richard the Second I think, And it was on that basis of the fact that, a, he could work cheaply, b, he could withstand the hostility of the Butlers of Ormond and, c, when he wanted to he could get tough against Geraldines and even against O'Neills and put them back in their place that he sued for return to London to discuss, the future development of English policy in Ireland By now close with Cromwell, he got permission to return Drew up a strategy of uh a marginal increase in force, this secured Cromwell 's agreement on marginal increase in the subvention of government, uh and was well received by King Henry in May fifteen forty And then it all fell apart And it didn't fall apart because of O'Neill and it didn't fall apart because of Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald, and it didn't fall apart because of uhm, the Geraldine inner It fell apart for reasons that had nothing at all to do with with Irish politics It fell apart because of, one man and two women, Henry the Eighth, Catherine, Parr, and Catherine Howard It fell apart when Thomas Cromwell pushed No sorry not that Catherine but Anne of Cleves and Catherine Howard It fell apart when Cromwell pushing forward a stronger, European alliance with the Lutheran princes of a holy Roman empire, persuaded the king, to agree, to marriage to take as his third wife now, busy, the Princess of Cleves Anne of Cleves Henry uh had some doubts about it, he didn't like the idea of a foreign alliance He secondly didn't like the idea of being pushed too far down the Lutheran way He 's broken with Rome, but the liturgy of the Church of England is still the Catholic liturgy as of fifteen forty He 's suspicious of that And his suspicions were confirmed when he saw what Anne of Cleves looked like He hated her He thought this was an awful idea And what later emerged was, it was a different person being presented to him in the frame in the body of Catherine Howard, a niece of the Duke of Norfolk Remember that guy who was the Earl of Surrey and came to Ireland in the fifteen twenties who offered, a local marriage with a powerful aristocratic family, a conservative marriage on the grounds of religion and no entangling alliances And apart from that he 'd a happy prospect of nights to come And so, Henry decided to move against Anne of Cleves And so Henry decided to move, against Thomas Cromwell And so even though he had made Thomas Cromwell Earl of Essex at the beginning of June fifteen forty a coup-d'e/tat <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> And in the second week of June fifteen forty at the council table the Duke of Norfolk accused Cromwell Earl of Essex of treason The King came in and indeed as uh <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> to believe that this was true Cromwell was arrested Yeah\n<$B> <unclear> several sylls </unclear> of the Duke of Norfolk\n<$A> The Duke of Norfolk uh the  premier peer of the realm had also had been in Ireland as the Earl of Surrey in the fifteen twenties Again if you were talking about somebody with the uh A Man For All Seasons he 's the guy played by Nigel Davenport in A Man For All Seasons Who you must remember <unclear> words </unclear> All these <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> uh Norfolk, the intent was of course to break the marriage uh proposal with Anne of Cleves, to establish the Howard marriage proposal, the Duke of Norfolk is a Howard, he 's Thomas Howard Duke of Norfolk, and to get rid of Cromwell at the same time Cromwell is thrown in jail and with him is thrown in jail a whole stack of his, councillors, advisors, supporters, like for instance Sir Peter Carew in Devonshire like for instance the Viscount Lyle like for instance the Viscount Bewley all of whom go to the big <&Spanish> adios </&Spanish> in the in the months between the summer of fifteen forty and the summer of fifteen forty-one, And likewise too his principal Irish uh, Leonard Grey For what happened in Leonard Grey 's case was that in addition to being uhm, identified with the now treasonable and unacceptable Cromwellian regime, the  file came down from, the shelf And all those treasonable allegations that had been quietly passed over by Cromwell, were not passed over by Norfolk at all, and used Now it may well be that the  the decision to get rid of Grey as they were getting rid of a whole group of Cromwell 's henchmen uhm, was  was determined principally uh for court for the reasons of court politics But there is another factor Another factor is this, that one of Norfolk 's principal supporters uhm, a courtier of no mean abilities was also a man of some Irish experience And that was the man who 'd headed up that commission of enquiry, a man who 'd, gathered all those treasonable allegations and would sit  who 'd sat quietly as Cromwell said, thank-you very much now, forget about them until fifteen forty I speak of Sir Anthony St Leger Now St Leger is one of those figures who 's had a, wonderful press uh in the Irish history books A kind of bright light in a naughty world, one who everybody thinks of him as being uh one of the few enlightened kind benign English governors who came to Ireland And that may well be so Uh Brendan Bradshaw has gone to uh to argue even that he was a a substantial uh, Renaissance intellectual May well be so too but the truth is we don't know because he 's cagey enough not to write a great deal Uh there is uh there is a folklore tradition that he did write uh occasional elegies of some of some wit, but he never wrote <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> and if he did it was never preserved He doesn't say much in his letters What he was, and this is something to bear in mind, in general, what he was was a man, who could get on well with the king Since fifteen twenty-nine the date of the fall of Wolsey, and St Leger had had some private little part in that fall, since fifteen twenty-nine Anthony St Leger had occupied one of the most important and influential places, in the Henrician court You know what it was\n<$X> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$A> No he wasn't the Lord Chancellor He wasn't the Lord Treasury He wasn't Lord this that or the other He was, one of the gentlemen pensioners Now what the gentlemen pensioners did, nice work if you can get it, was they went drinking with the king, they went whoring with the king, they went gambling with the king, they went hunting with the king, they went having fun with the king That was their primary job, stay up late with the king, get up late with the king, be around when the king wants to tell the right jokes, laugh at the right places cry at the right places St Leger, Surrey, Thomas White all had done this kind of thing and St Leger was particularly successful at And I think it is St Leger 's, remarkable closeness with Henry the Eighth You can see this in his correspondence I can't see great humanist ideas in the correspondence but what I can see are jokes and in sending over horses to the king and in sending over goshawks to the king and sending him up what hunting was like in Ireland to the king all which indicates that the connection, isn't political isn't ideological but was personal and intimate And it was by the way as intimate of the king, you know the king liked to have fun through the fifteen thirties that St Leger had acquired substantial monastic estates <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> in Kent not only for himself but for his <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>\n<$X> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$A> Sorry, I did indeed yeah Uhm, <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> the races and he was very good with the gee-gees, St Leger , To be honest I actually think it 's pronounced Salinger as J D Salinger well if that 's I think a derivation from it but it 's spelt St Leger so we 'll keep it like that <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> But if you want to call him Salinger that 's fine by me, Nevertheless in, July fifteen forty even as Grey was languishing in the tower and he 'd another eleven months to go before they had done their time for, for treason uh even as Grey was doing this St Leger pursued the Irish office And although he might say that 's a great idea, I 'm very pleased with this indeed, the old problems still remained And in many ways the old problems, are now worse Consider it He 'd replaced Grey who for all his faults at least had been cheap Now was St Leger going to be any more expensive Appoint me King Henry and I 'll be better but I 'll be a lot more expensive though So the imperative of being, economical of practising fiscal austerity remained every bit as firm under the new regime as it had been under the old Secondly the Geraldines weren't too pleased at all you know Just as they thought they 'd made some kind of unsteady relationship with uh, with Grey and they 'd lost it And they had this new guy to see to and that 's not nice at all And one of the nasty straws in the wind was that as Grey fell and before St Leger came the Geraldines spirited away, the young Kildare pair, first to Paris then to Florence Nobody was going to catch them now But the third problem was perhaps the worst of all You notice the guys <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> hadn't they The <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> upgrade the Butlers, the English administrators who sought his head on a block in fifteen thirty-seven and had to wait about two and a half years to get it and at long last got it they had been scalped They, could destroy an English viceroy So here we are again in fifteen forty the way they were in fifteen thirty-six What would St Leger do What would you do now,\n<$B> Spend lots of money\n<$A> Oh yes I think that 's a smart way to go but you know how do you do that without being in uh not getting into trouble He doesn't have to spend lots of money <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> but what he did in the first instance was to establish a framework within which it was possible, for this kind of benign administration to be, initiated And the framework he established was the framework I spoke about earlier in lecture one, a framework of, the constitution of revolution, the new kingdom of Ireland established by statute by an Irish statute and an Irish parliament in, June fifteen forty-one",

{"text": "<Multi-media talk>\n\n\n<$A> Uhm, creating multi-media materials And I actually changed that earlier on and uh you 'll see it the change, rather than courseware because this is part of the presentation as well that will go to uh into to the schools and to to some trainers as well as to how can you get into multi-media What can you, what sort of things can you create with it And uh the exciting thing about multi-media is that you can get,  computers have got to the point now where they 're powerful enough to do the work for you to a large extent And that that 's really exciting cos that means that you can get straight, or pretty quickly uh to the point where you can start making decisions and controlling where you want to go in this computer environment Now the, that 's, we put together, actually the the presentation package that uh is being used to present this information, one of the, one of the core tools I think uh for for all the projects that were suggested projects in the Bytes for Belfast project So uh, we can look at the tools themselves and I think uhm these are the sorts of tools that are available on the Macintosh in uhm, for the Macintosh computer And HyperCard and Director, those two tools, the top one there, and the bottom ones are the ones that are being supplied and very exciting tools because you can quickly without any programming whatsoever, and that 's really what authoring means so you 're not you know not programming tools they 're authoring tools We can go in and simply by choosing menu options, we can put together text,  we can put together graphics, we can put together uhm, film, we can put together speech, we can put together music, and control them, or, for example the uh suggested music project we can use the computer to control, the playback of music via electronic keyboards or control equipment uh for uh technological purposes for the uh the, they 're examples of, I 'm not actually qualified to talk much about the uh materials at the back of the room that have been designed by some schools, but again that 's one of the suggested projects that 's using a Macintosh computer to control uh the production of those materials So a note of reassurance about the ease with which now everything is in inverted commas because the better you do things the more time that you invest in them or the more time you invest the better you you do things But it 's possible to after an hour, after two hours, to get encouraging results and maybe that 's the maybe that 's an evening or an afternoon session You can produce materials and take those materials away, either saving them to tape or a video cassette or on a floppy disc and uhm the progress is actually measurable in that sense that the the uhm results of our endeavours are there, they 're visible, you can hear them Uh we can, we can then uhm take them and display them to somebody else somewhere else So to have a look at how exactly you might be getting photographic materials into the computer, using a device the scanner, like a uhm photocopy machine connected to the computer which would give you either depending on the scanner I think there 'll be colour scanners uh provided, for the centres, taking in large screen images or short screen   images or bringing into the computer photographic still images That 's one way of getting photographs into this presentation Not the small hand scanner I think the uhm that 's a very handy tool very cheap tool and very flexible tool because you can move around with that, but uh we can there are varieties of different types of scanners Just skip Photo-CD that 's not well yes it is uh important Another way of getting images into the computer is simply take your film to the chemist and uh or sorry to Boots in town and say press this onto Photo-CD and uh it will be the case that if you go out with a camera photograph, get it pressed onto Photo-CD, the equipment the Apple equipment is capable of then accessing those photographic images without scanning them at all and that 's that 's relatively easy, if you get images in that way into the computer, Now, alternatives or there 's a picture of John Anderson last night producing uh his presentation for today, and again we can get, immediately get the results fast and that 's very encouraging that we don't have to wait for uhm a week even to come back from the developers It 's possible, the technology is there to enable you to just go  take the photograph and we could demonstrate it now to the camera and get that photograph into the into the equipment into your presentation, into your programme that you 're designing I think that 's, that was all the ones there More possibilities Two other suggested projects are the, the producing the video, and uh the storyboard project Okay again, highlighting here a little illustration done with one of the tools that uh would be one of the core materials It 's uh swivel, swivel three-D, a modelling tool enabling you to create uhm moving images, little movies if you like on the computer And the tools are accessible they 're intuitive you don't have to be a programmer in order to go in and create animations within this computer environment Now, there are a list of points here uh that could be examined in depth about the video requirements but I 'll just bypass that because the hardware, it should be like a black box It should be and it will be like a black box where the equipment is supplied and you connect up the video camera into the computer and simply press a few buttons, I 'll demonstrate in a second, and you 're grabbing the images you 're grabbing moving images, either from the camera, a camcorder, or from television, or from the uh video cassette recorder So there are there 're lots of possibilities there using equipment that 's uh, you would be used to perhaps uh a range of those  in the household You click on the, bit of luck, click on the camera, and uh, just have a look at a few just a little bit more detail Now that 's I was using this presentation this morning for a different group of uh of teacher trainers and uh they were particularly, because they were teachers, interested in these particular areas but of course the applications are, are right across the board Anywhere where a video camera anywhere the where with the information, on television on uh video cassette or uh from a camera itself where that 's important, where you want to use it, this is the this is the way of working with that Let 's look at uh television and video images Now, I warn you I sort of uh, before I actually look at this I 'll say that the equipment I 'm using for displaying this back is quite limited uh power and you 're not going to see very large windows of uh movie windows But the, for one of the projects the video project it will have the equipment to enable you to actually display full screen uhm movies on the computer  Right so we 're actually connecting up to a television and that was actually taken off the disc of somebody else who had connected it to a television and saying, start recording, stop recording and you 've got the uh the film embedded in the computer 's memory and you can work work with that then, move it to a different document and uh maybe save this to tape as well connect this to a video cassette recorder produce a a video That 's one possibility I mention the possibility of grabbing camera images bringing them into the computer  That 's a little bit disappointing because there 's a loss of synch there between the lips, and then and again it 's not a very powerful   uhm, piece of equipment to  that 's been added to this  computer to enable you to do that But I would expect we 'd get better results uh with the equipment that we have, that we 'd actually be using within the project Stills, been linked up to a television programme which was Understanding Northern Ireland and uh grabs were made, just clicking on the screen and saying I want to save that image I want to save this next image in the television programme, the next one, the next one Now they are some of the uh visual possibilities You can explore the music possibilities I 'm not particularly uhm, uh able to do that I don't work a lot with music but the potential is there It can connect to uh a media keyboard and uh you can record to the computer and playback to your computer That 's very flexible for presentations very flexible for the way it 's very exciting it means that I can go in and then I don't have to be as Derek was saying a great musician in order to be able to create But one of the possibilities is creating uhm interactive comics, interactive graphic novels, uh something an art form, of uh a type of future art form Why don't you see these things Because of course people in their homes don't have interactive machines to be able to play back these uh these styles of uh presentations this style of story Nevertheless it 's possible to imagine that you could do that in future We can actually print this out, print the materials out as well in uh comic book format There 's John he says who cares let 's stick to KidPix which is a, a uhm paint package on the Macintosh These, types of uh, literature This materials these comics these graphic novels, are very much upfront in the sorts of things that I, I mean I want to read if I go in and uh pick up a book at a particular age in in town Shattered, this is a comic that totally created in the Apple Macintosh, The illustrations have been modelled using the tools that are available there, Other publications that have come out just recently are The Digital Justice a graphic novel uh again generated entirely on the Macintosh and it would be nice to think and I think not unrealistic to believe that you can go in and you can create models like this and uh produce uh just as I 'm doing a a presentation of which is an interactive presentation We could save it to tape as well we could create animations, output materials to tape Okay if I click, show you some more examples, here Of course very professional productions But the excitement is that you can go in, I can show you some of the  materials that we have designed for, for schools as well using tools like this and the tools that will be available to you, to go in and start building up objects, superimposing photographs, applying special effects using some of the software that 's available there, to get towards results like this that of course are better the more uhm time you put into it Well I think that that would be an exciting exploration of the potential of this technology as well Of course we can add we can add sound to it We uhm demonstrate how to add sound as well simply by where there is a microphone connected, connected to this computer you can record straight in the sound And uhm, I think that 's it I think that uhm what have I covered I 've covered the the possibilities of the different media types that you can actually store onto the machine Would you be interested in me demonstrating actually using one of these tools or if that 's getting too much down into the nitty-gritty Or I think I would like to stop there and just ask for some reaction to, to what I 've shown", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Cooking>\n\n\n<$A> The other one that I 'm using is balsamic vinegar Now we 've been using it for years, but as well as adding it here to marinate this and to break down the structure, it 's the greatest ingredient to give flavour and also it 'll you 'll find it will change the texture of the meat completely Put all of those in and then just toss them round and mix them in that Now if you have time, leave it to sit,  even ten fifteen minutes But if you haven't time it doesn't matter with this dish because this is what I would call an instant marinade and once you 've tossed it round you 'll find even the colour of the meat will have started to change That 's when we 're ready to cook it I 'm going to stir-fry this beef and not only is it fast but it 's healthy as well and do you know you 'll need only the tiniest little bit of oil I 'm cooking this in a wok and as well as that it 's got a non-stick surface on it so you can get away with  even very little That 's just about half a teaspoonful Now the secret in the cooking of this is all to do with the temperature They 'll want the heat that 's coming off this to be as high as you can possibly get it and it 's almost when you see that sort of faint haze coming off the pan, that 's when you 're ready to start and add it Now a word of advice, don't be tempted to put it all in at once Once you 've got that faint haze and here it comes, we 're ready to put the beef in Now look, just a tiny little bit at the time And you 'll hear that sizzlers of the beef as it goes into the pan And if you can, just keep going right round the pan little bit at the time and do you know, as it goes into this pan and with the marinade on it, the heat just seals the goodness and the flavour and the texture straight into this all at once It almost caramelises the beef and turns it a wonderfully sort of goldeny-brown colour There we go Just keep popping it in like that right round until you 've got it all in, and as I say this wafer-thin slices will cook for us in no time at all There we are The secret of good stir-frying is to keep the meat constantly on the move and keep the temperature as high as you possibly can and make use of the sides of the wok Keep stirring it right round the sides like that until all this liquid that went in with the meat has gone right into the meat And that 's what makes the flavour in this dish Now we 're ready to add the vegetables and there 's really only one main one in this and that 's about two hundred and twenty-five grams of mushrooms I 've just washed them, cut them up into nice sort of quite thick slices because I find mushrooms just disappear in front of your eyes whenever you 're cooking them Just toss those round with the beef, and again these will pick up any of these juices that 's coming from the meat Now it 's time to get the flavour into this one at this stage, and this is a convenient sort of family-style dish I want to put some chillies into it and it 's the sweet chilli sauce that comes out of a jar and I 've got a couple of tablespoonfuls there That 's, all goes in at once As well as that I 'm adding some tomato It 's the tomato passata again Couple of tablespoonfuls here, and that 's really smooth sieved tomato paste That goes in as well and at this stage just toss it all around I 'm going to add a few spring onions to it for colour So a good sprinkling of those over the top, to give it a little bit of extra colour and texture as well Now just allow this all to heat through, and then once the mushrooms are well cooked that 's it ready to serve Now I like to serve this one I think it 's best of all served with a few lovely sort of crunchy fresh leaves and those simple tortilla corn chips those lovely Mexican ones The two of those go really well with this hot spicy beef  Often the simplest old-fashioned puddings are best, especially when it comes to getting good nutrition into your kids, and aren't there few of us who don't love a bowl of good creamy rice pudding This one 's got a few twists in it It 's a more up-to-date version and I call this a marvellous malted souffle/ rice pudding Starts off with milk, and the choice of milk is entirely up to you If you want to follow a sort of a healthy diet well then you can go for the low fat milk But I 'm using about a litre of the full cream one because I think that gives you a much creamier pudding and one that 's much nicer In the milk goes, just turn up the heat and then we 're ready for the rice Now the rice that you use for rice pudding is totally different from the ones that you make your curries with Even the grain looks different This is little fat grain It 's as wide as it 's long And I 've got about four ounces that 's a hundred and ten grams It all goes in together, needs a little bit of sugar to sweeten it and I 'm just using about an ounce of a non-refined sort of cane sugar here Uhm it 's a slightly sort of more golden colour and that too all goes in at once For flavour, wee tiny bit of vanilla extract and again I find if you 're cooking for a family this vanilla extract just works really well It 's only a couple of drops of it and that 's all the main ingredients at the start of this rice pudding Now you need to give it a good stir round, and the way you cook it is very important, because you 've got to bring it right up to boiling point Now that 's very important to get the grains to start to burst Once you 've got to that stage, then turn the temperature down and just leave it to simmer for about an hour  And isn't this what good rice pudding is all about Just look how thick and creamy it has become Now I 'm going to leave that just to cool down for a few minutes because I 'm moving onto the next stage and that 's the souffle/ part of it It 's made with three egg whites into a bowl but if you 're beating up egg whites you need to be really careful that the bowl is completely clean, because if there 's even a hint of fat in it you 'll find they 'll not beat up There 's no sugar in this at all So just whisk these, just until you get them nice and light Now that 's going to take about five to six minutes altogether, and once you 've got it to that stage they 're now ready to add to the rice pudding Now put it all in at once Don't dilly-dally round with this one because the rice is still slightly warm and so it 's all got to go in together It 's this egg white that 's going to add the souffle/ part to it and really help it to crunch it, to puff up So all of that going in, and there 's one other ingredient going in as well and it 's these little chocolate malty sweets Packet of them here and just crush these slightly when you come to put them in Now if you put in some whole ones that 's okay but you just want to crush them up slightly because when these come to cook in the oven you 'll find they will break down even more So in those all go as well at this stage Now, just lightly chopping through this, as I said, don't mix this too much, as little as you can possibly get away with, until all the egg white is just folded in right throughout the rice pudding There that looks just about ready As I say that only takes about a minute and as I said the coarser you leave the sweets, all the better At this stage just get rid of the spoon, and I 'm going to pour it into an oven-proof dish Now I 've just lightly greased it, dusted it with a tiny little bit of caster sugar and then just pour that all right into the dish like that It 'll flatten itself out nice and evenly over the top, and then once you 've done that I 'm just going to cover it with a few flaked almonds Just about twenty-five grams, lightly dusted over the top and then that 's it ready for the oven Cooks at two hundred and twenty degrees centigrade, that 's gas mark seven, and it should take about ten minutes  And that 's what I call a marvellously malted souffle/ rice pudding  We 've been eating potato bread for years and do you know the way I normally cook it 's to put it in the pan and fry it in a tiny little bit of oil and then top it with an egg But here, I 'm going to use it to make a really tasty chicken and ham sandwich Going to chargrill the potato bread and do you know this is a super bread because it 's a wonderful mixture of buttermilk and potatoes all combined together into a bread and it makes a great basis for this sandwich The other ingredients that are going with this are chicken fillet, and look, I 've chopped those up into tiny little ribbon strips I think if it 's something tasty in the form of a sandwich or a snack you 're after, you want all the ingredients to come together nice and quickly and that 's exactly what this one does The chicken fillets have no oil either and they 're cooking on the grill pan just until they become nice and crispy And that 'll probably only take with that about five to six minutes, putting some ham with it and it 's the Italian Parma ham, one that 's slightly smoked, one that doesn't even need any cooking But do you know if you put it onto the grill pan here and just heat it slightly it 'll crisp it up and it 'll add a wonderful texture to the sandwich I 've just got about three slices there so that 's going on as well  other ingredients to go with it are a few black olives And I love the flavour of black olives with this one Again they don't need any heating but they 're even nicer if you just heat them up slightly A few tomatoes and it 's the sunblush tomatoes, so they go on too Now at this stage we should be ready to turn the potato bread over Going to leave that for a couple of minutes on either side And keep turning the chicken Do exactly the same with the ham and then when everything 's ready it 's time to put this sandwich together And this one looks absolutely stunning because it 's a layer of potato bread, topped with the griddled chicken, few slices of ham, few black olives and sunblush tomatoes, and then finished off with basil mayonnaise And that 's mayonnaise just about a spoonful mixed with a teaspoonful of finely chopped basil  Nutritionally potatoes are terrific They 're loaded with vitamin C and they 'll fill you up and not out, so why not get the kids to eat them more often", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "65ab9f1f-9d7a-48d5-a95b-d4658848a214",

{"text": "<Home improvement>\n\n\n<$A> When Matthew asked for a treehouse his dad had a problem Despite being a well-known and experienced architect, it looked like this challenge might be insurmountable There wasn't a tree in the garden that was big enough Undaunted, dad came up with the solution He decided to build a free-standing house, but wedged between two trees He is so proud of it that he even refused to move house because that would have meant leaving it behind Most kids would love a treehouse, but with so many people living in houses with new gardens, finding a tree that 's suitable can be a problem\n<$B>  Hey Mister, I want a treehouse \n<$A> Well I don't have a tree to build it in, but if I build you a treeless treehouse, will that do So how do you build yourself a treeless treehouse First you need a garden shed or a kids ' playhouse Mine 's just been delivered and is being put together at the moment This children 's playhouse has had the front wall shifted back about a foot to create this little veranda And very nice indeed A small garden shed with the front wall flush to the front would do just as well If you really want to impress those kids you 're going to have to lift this house off the ground, and to do that you 're going to need to put it up on stilts Whoooooo I 'm using five foot lengths of three inch by three inch spruce, And it will take six stilts to carry the weight of the shed Make up a frame like this using cross members for added support You could nail the frame together but to avoid splitting the timbers, pre-drill the holes and use brass screws which won't rust It 's important to remember that the width and length of the frame need to be less than the base of the shed You need to allow for twice the thickness of the plinth in order for the floor to fit over the stilts and the distance from the top of the stilts to the first beam should be the same as the depth of the plinth in order that the base of the shed can rest on this frame Dig six holes about eighteen inches deep which allows you six inches for gravel on which to level the posts, Apply your preservative to the base of your posts prior to placing them in the holes, paying particular attention to the end grain At this stage it 's important to check that the whole frame is sitting level Using a straight edge you can check that both the long edges and the diagonals are sitting true If it 's not level, pack in gravel to make any minor adjustments In this case I 'm using quick-setting cement, but if you are using a regular mix, you should allow at least twenty-four hours before placing the house on the frame To lift the house onto the frame you will need some friends The heavier the shed, the bigger your next round is at the pub, The only thing left to do now is to add some steps Good bye Harry Although this treehouse is only four feet off the ground, if you 're going to allow young children to use it, it would be essential to have a safety rail\n\n<$C> John interior design by computer I don't believe it Is this possible\n<$D> Well, it 's not by computer but you can use a computer to help you do it Previously it really was only architects and specialists who used this sort of thing but they 've become much more accessible and affordable\n<$C> What are we talking about I mean a  a price to design your own front room for instance\n<$D> Well this little piece of software that I have on this machine is about a hundred pounds\n<$C> Not bad\n<$D> What we 've got is a floor plan equivalent to what you would get actually on a piece of paper You can see dimensions there if I just zoom in a second What it 's doing now is it 's actually building the room for us, it 's sorting out the polygons People mightn't think they have many of those in their house  Everybody has polygons\n<$C> Fantastic\n<$D> What 's nice about it now is that once we 're in there we can say as well, let 's have a little look around   And we can go this way \n<$C> So you  can actually wander   through the house\n<$D> We can wander through the house and just have a look as we go along\n<$C> Can you use the system on any computer\n<$D> Any personal computer of about the last year or so So you what you will find is that some of the older systems don't have sufficient horsepower to handle the three-D graphics\n<$C> Now if I wanted to design myself my own room and put furniture in it Can we do that\n<$D> Yes We can do that\n<$C> Nice bright room to play with what I 'm going to have first of all, could I have please John a sofa\n<$D> Okay, no problem\n<$C> And I 'll have it, I think there Just along there facing the fire\n<$D> Okay\n<$C> Mm You know don't like it there Could you move it Can we move it to the back wall\n<$D> No problem\n<$C> That 'll do nicely Ah no it 's too big, it 's too big Can you can you do anything about that\n<$D> Yeah Yeah what about a two-seater\n<$C> Two-seater would be perfect, yeah That would do the trick Two-seater on the back wall, sold And let 's see, what else do I want Uhm, I think something to keep the drink in and the glasses of course Something there, something big Could you give me a, a cabinet John Cocktail cabinet\n<$D> Coming up\n<$C> Looks a bit bare Can you uhm, can you fill it with bottles\n<$D> Unfortunately not Sean\n<$C> Oh well Uh, what else It 's a bit, it is still a bit bare isn't it A plant, could you do me a plant or two Oh very very clever Not in the middle of the room I didn't want a forest Stick it in the, corner Stick it in the corner\n<$D> Like that\n<$C> Yeah Looks almost real doesn't it What we need now is a television Can you manage that\n<$D> No problem\n<$C> Okay Television let 's see Uhm over, there I think No No let 's give the burglars a really good view from the window Let 's put it right bang in that corner\n<$D> Okay\n<$C> Do you think it 's too much to ask to have some legs on it, or a table\n<$D> Okay done\n<$C> And what about a little uhm elegance, something to impress people with books A coffee table Okay\n<$D> A coffee table Here we go\n<$C> Mm It 's not looking bad at all Uhm actually the walls are bare We 've got something very essential missing Can you give me a picture John Any chance of some art\n<$D> Alright\n<$C> Actually, I think it 's maybe just a tiny bit, bourgeois Let 's do it again\n<$D> Absolutely not\n\n<$A> The first thing you should always think about when working with ladders must be safety The angle that you set your ladder at is perhaps one of the most important safety points If you have it at too steep an angle you risk falling backwards off the ladder Too shallow an angle however, means you may overload the ladder To find the correct angle to set your ladder at, for every four metres of height, have the base one metre from the wall When faced with a situation like this where the roof overhangs, you can't lean the  ladder against the wall because you 'll have to reach out too far to catch the gutter If you reach it against the gutter, you risk damaging the gutter or having the ladder slip The solution is to use a ladder stand-on which spaces the ladder from the wall and also prevents it from slipping If you 're working with your ladder on a steep gradient it won't be safe just packing up one leg of the ladder with bricks and blocks like these What you really need to do is build a wooden platform, the base of which must be two foot by two You then need to nail a batten onto your platform to prevent your ladder from slipping, Another important part of ladder safety is that you must always have somebody hold the base of the ladder for you And you should have at least a metre between the top of the ladder and the point at which you 're standing And finally, to stop your ladder sinking into soft ground, what you need to do is to take your board with some large nails <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> through it to stop it slipping and then push this firmly into the ground\n\n<$E> The distressed look is achieved by using two colours, one base colour that 's going to  show through sparingly, and a top colour which is applied once your base colour has been given a good generous rub down with a common household candle It 's quite a popular look at the moment, it 's fairly informal and quite rustic Once you have applied your top coat on top of the candle wax, give it a good hard rub back with medium grade wire wool You could start off quite gently and build up the distressing You don't want to have it looking too artificial A good way to finish off the a distressed surface is actually good old uh shoe polish A nice dark brown will actually intensify the colour as well as protecting the wood Crackle glaze is a is a really good high impact finish that you can achieve with very very little effort indeed Uhm it looks very impressive and the technique is extremely easy and extremely quick It 's really best thought of as a as a paint sandwich You 've got one layer of paint underneath your base coat, one layer of glaze in the middle, once that 's dry, another layer of paint on top What happens is the glaze dries at a different time to the emulsion top coat and as the two start to dry, one will pull the other apart and give you these quite quite dramatic cracks You can also achieve uh some quite impressive fantasy finishes with crackle glaze by applying it in circles and applying your top coat on straight I 've discovered that you can also determine the size of the cracks by the thickness of your top coat If you apply that fairly thickly you 'll end up with quite a large crack If you do apply heat to it with a hair dryer on full blast you 'll be able to speed up the whole cracking process and enlarge those cracks into the bargain I think that the floor is really an area of great untapped potential in everybody 's home It 's the area in a room that I think can can unify the whole scheme It can really bring a room to life People are very very nervous about tackling a floor with paint and really, uh if the floor is appropriately primed, there 's absolutely no reason that it can't be completely transformed with paint We have colour-washed the floorboards which have been sanded, just given a quick wipe down Dilute down any water-based acrylic paint, probably three parts water to one part paint You could experiment and maybe even try five parts to to one part paint If you do it on a warm day you 'll have a floor completed  in a wood wash in no time at all With this floor I thought I 'd go for something really dramatic indeed I have used quite a quite a strong border  design in a mosaic It 's , and a nice contrast of uhm deep aquamarine blues with green Uhm contrasting that with a little white mosaic with a hint of pink And in the centre I 've used quite a big bold swirling shell-like design that reverses in on itself It 's lots of movement and lots of interest there, and I think it really does set off the rest of the de/cor in the room I think you 'll agree that there 's been really quite a memorable transformation in this room We 've taken it from something that was blank, dull and really a bit depressing into the realms of fantasy almost A bit of confidence, a spirit of adventure and between seventy-five and two hundred pounds should really put you well on the way to achieving this sort of a look", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3fc7cb77-eace-405b-996d-dcbb0ad21367", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.367143+00:00"}
{"text": "<Fitness class>\n\n\n<$A> What we 're going to focus on today is the little love handles Uhm we 're going to do a few extra steps, for the abdominals A special request and I always like to cater  Okay, so just starting off, with a nice, slow march, arms pumping I know it 's quite warm today but, have a go Relax the muscles and get the body going Okay so just marching back, one two three Forward one two three  Now the knee lift  Now bringing that in to a knee lift Right Left And forward Right stepping back Left stepping forward  From here just stepping out Now what I 'm going to focus on, is, I mean if you can just do one side at a time Do a step back out with the left leg Just raising the arms but not above your shoulders Just keep them shoulder high Stepping in left In Out Right And one, two  And hold From here just take your feet out forty-five or ten to two, and just give a nice deep squat down One, and up Two,  Hold and pulse for ten  Reach up Back down Coming up onto your right toe Keeping your back really really straight and working it up into the glutes  Right heel down Left heel up Right up on the ball of the foot  Heel down Feet going forward Just taking a nice deep breath in As you breath out looking forward Looking up so you can see yourself in the mirror Keep looking up Walking your hands slowly down the outside of your thighs You should feel a nice stretch in your hamstring If you are not if you are finding it uncomfortable if you just bend your knees slightly  From here, you 'll point, your right knee forward, and hold  Whenever you are moving over to the left leg just bend your knees so you are staying down Then you 'll know cos you want to keep that stretch nicely up  Just coming forward from here Just placing your hands on the inside of the legs You 'll feel a nice stretch in the inner thighs  From there place your hands just behind your heels And all you 're going to do is just going to drop your backside slightly Raise up Back down Very small movement You are only focusing on to get into those glutes  If you find it quite comfortable just bring your hands out front  And just coming up Slowly straighten up the legs <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> From here, if you take, your left hand 's going to go up at forty-five The right hand 's going to come down If you twist around, and hold  Back to the centre Right hand 's up and left hand down to the right shoulder  Back to the centre again This time we 're going to work on and now squat I want you to imagine that you 're closing a drawer, and try and sit down and now imagine it 's closed behind you And then you are going to pull the drawer open as you are coming up Okay so everybody get this one So you are pushing down, just holding it there And pull the drawer closed Push or pull the drawer open Drawer closing Push it closed Open  Hold it down there for ten  From here hold the squat down From the squat, into the centre and lift your right knee Squat down Lift up your right Squat down Lift up your left Now if you are finding to hold that knee, uncomfortable to put too much stress on your joints, keep it nice and high So just go small, one, small, two If you really want to work, like the entire leg, try and make it a little lower But don't think we 're all <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> If you find at any time you have too much stress in your knees or anything, relax and stand up, and just shake them out Okay Is everybody ready And squat Right knee up Squat Left knee up Squat Right knee up Squat Left knee up Try to think of bringing your shoulder your knees to your shoulder, to make them nice and straight, to really work it into the glutes  And, face just coming forward And nice and slowly, coming up onto your right Put the ball of your foot on your right leg Left, right, left, right, left Okay Now this time whenever we 're going into the squat, if, I want to really focus, on your feet Now forty-five Keep your back really straight Okay If you are finding that quite easy <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> Just hold it here Move your  your feet, slightly more apart You really should be working more into the inner thighs This is a very small pulsing movement  And hold for ten <&> counting Nice and slowly Keep going forward Down on the heel toe heel toe What we 're going to do now is we 're going to do a set, of exercises on the mats So get back on your feet Go into the lunging Back out on the steps All ab exercises And finish it off with a stretch So we 're going to grab a quick drink now, and grab your mat for it, What it is the first exercise we 're going to focus on, is the reverse curl If you place your hands down beside your body, and just curl your knees up, into your chest, like like a baby Knees up Chest <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> If you 're finding that quite easy, then bring in, <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> your your heels Use your lower abdomen to push you up And finish up okay So everybody ready Deep breath in

{"text": "<Pastry>\n\n\n<$A> Right First things first Going to make pastry today Shortcrust pastry You have half the quantity of fat to flour So there 's a little note at the top there, pastry  flan cakes, and I have six ounces of  flour and I use self-raising flour Or you can use half self-raising flour and half plain flour if you want Or just use plain flour if you 've always used that I just tend to use self-raising flour It does rise ever so slightly but makes a slightly lighter pastry I always think Uhm and half the quantity of that  I think last, no a couple of years ago, do you remember Sister Teresa 's last year I started,  she always said you could taste the the raising agents in the flour so, and after she said that I started to taste it And there is a slight, you know, there is a different taste A man on a galloping horse I don't know if he 'd really notice you know But if you, if you make pastry at home stick to what you use if you 're doing an apple tart because it 's the same type of pastry It 's the same type of pastry that you use in savoury pastry also if you 're going to do a quiche and if you 're going to do uhm a savoury mince pie say The only thing is is that you can add a  uhm a dessertspoonful of castor sugar or icing sugar into this pastry to make it  a little bit sweeter, which just gives it a nice little edge You can use butter, you can use Churn which is a combination of cream and margarine vegetable oils or you can just use uh the margarine that you use all the time If you use butter naturally you 'll get a different flavour because butter does give things a lovely flavour There 's no doubt about it I 'm using butter because I had uhm I  Mace didn't have a, they haven't had any Churn in for the past couple of days and uhm this was on offer actually Dromona in Mace, the Mace sort for ninety-nine pence which is excellent  I was in Lidl  Lidl  Lidl , Lidl , and uhm, I I picked up some of their butter and is it one nineteen  And of course it 's sitting in the fridge and I forgot it  So I 'll just wash my hands and we 'll get going I 've set, I already put the oven on, set it for two hundred That oven 's working a bit slow But if you 're making anything with uhm pastry, if you turn your oven up and put your product in, in a hot oven for even for the first fifteen minutes, ten fifteen minutes, it sets the pastry, it  makes it gives it a good blast of heat and then what happens it sets it I always think you get a nice sort of uhm, a  well not a crust on it It doesn't go  you know crunchy but it just sets it so and then you can lower the temperature to cook the fruit or the meat or whatever you you 're cooking So normally if I was doing an apple tart I 'd put it in for about fifteen minutes at two hundred degrees centigrade and I have a fan-assisted oven at home And then what I would do is turn it right down to about uhm, oh about a hundred and sixty and leave it in there for thirty-five minutes or forty minutes really at that But  but initially that first blast of heat sets, what I would call, sets the pastry It 's a bit like a Christmas cake, putting the Christmas cakes in at a high temperature It it it it sets the top of the cake, gives it a nice uhm outer coating let 's say I wouldn't say crust because you don't want a crust , Any questions so far Everyone happy Yeah, Right, now Now you can do pastry either by using the rubbing-in method with your fingertips or you can use the food processor If you use the food processor just pop in your fat  in your flour and pop it in and whiz it up and it churns it up a bit Uhm, you can also then add an egg, instead of adding water to it to bind it together you can put an egg in it which gives you a richer pastry And uhm let 's just turn it out The knack is, is don't have it whizzing about too much cos then you 're going to overwork the flour, the gluten in the flour, and you 'll get stretchy uh pastry Leathery pastry And it has that look on it, uhm, uh a stretched look to it even whenever it 's cooked And it 's really, I think it 's it 's down to a trained eye, the more you make uh pastry and even cakes you you 'll notice these little things It 's like if you get your ingredients uhm slightly knocked out in cake making you 'll get a different texture of cake, and uh you know the crumbliness of it whenever you cut it can look it also look parched, with the amount of holes, the texture of it And that 's maybe you get up to the uhm examining levels and entering all your things in for shows That 's what the examiner 's looking for It 's , your presentation yes and things like that but actually it 's the the the texture of it the you know whether you it 's been overworked and one thing and another And remember whenever we were making scones I sort of said if you ever, if you 're ever wanting to impress give give your visitors the scones you make in the first cut-out because they 're always, be, the re-rolls have that different look about them and it 's the same with pastry Actually the first thing you roll out you should actually put that aside to leave it for your top But what would you be doing, psychologically, oh quick get another plate, you know we 've got to get the filling in But try and remember to leave that to the side, you know, and then use the next bit underneath for the bottom Because nobody ever sees the bottom And in my place whenever you sometimes have to do a patchwork quilt on the top I 'm not going to say any more Right So uhm I I I 'm going to make it by in the food processor but I 'll wait because I 'll do the next time the pastry I 'll do it in the  ooh, the food processor, and I 'll stick an egg in it and uhm to make it nice and rich So into our basin I 've got a pound of self-raising flour already measured out And I 'm going to add eight ounces of, of fat If you 're using fat straight out of the fridge or out of the freezer and it 's very very hard, use uh use uh a grater and grate it and it means that it 'll mix in uhm, nicely Right there we are So I 've got eight ounces of fat <unclear> several sylls </unclear>, Just use the largest size the grater, on the grater Right, and, there we are you can see it comes through little strands, Oh I 'm daft  Typical of me Oh gosh there 's not an awful lot of flour I 've put on the the uhm the box that had half a pound of flour in so I 'll take half of this Me talking too much again Oh last week you 'd have roared Well I well I wasn't roaring  I was nearly crying We did muffins last week, as you remember, the  the summer fruit muffins And on Wednesday the the the girl that 's the manager up in the Holy Trinity Family Centre had been on the course and she 's got a package with uhm  one of those uhm automatic the plugs with the timers on it And then there was a a thing that you connected to the front door and as soon as the door was opened it let out sort of high-pitched wail It had uh a personal alarm system which you could either pull from above if you 're being attacked you know that sort of thing There 's about five things in a pack all for ten pounds And of course she was demonstrating these and it was wailing and these things were going off and you know that horrible pitch  and I 'm busy doing my muffins at the same time but you know having a nosy at at, she was displaying them at the side of the And uh, och Mary went along to pop these muffins in and got onto the second batch and lo and behold what did I, what had I forgotten to put in The raising agent The baking powder Och if you 'd seen them  They were like little bricks  And somebody said och don't worry we 'll eat them  I says you couldn't eat those, and fair enough oh they were as hard as anything Right But if you do want to use that recipe next uhm for the muffins, just use self-raising flour It 's easier I tend to try and, sometimes I change the recipe too to, make life easier for myself but then other times I sort of stick to what the recipe says <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Right My grated butter and I 'm just going to rub it in Just using your fingertips Just rub it through the flour, It doesn't take  very long when you grate it Until you 've got a mixture that resembles fine breadcrumbs And as I say if you do have a food processor and it is handy to make pastry in in your food processor Right Now I want to add, I 'm going to add a little caster sugar cos sometimes the pastry, sweet pastry for sweet dishes, it is nice just to have a little sweetness in So about a dessertspoonful, which is only about half an ounce And for those of you that can't, have to watch the old sugar intake, just don't put it in at all You know that It 's quite alright when you bake and cook but just reduce all your sugar right down and don't add extra sugar you know if you 're diabetic and things like that Right Now just make a well in the centre, of my, bowl and I 'm going to add, going to add about six dessertspoonfuls of water So it 'll take quite a bit , And we 'll just, mix this, Now another reason why your pastry will end up like leather is if you put too much water in Six ounces of flour would roughly do, you know, if you 're very, you know I should say six ounces because it gives you a little bit to play with If you were used to making a lot of pastry you know four would be enough for that sort of seven-inch plate really, But if you have any pastry left over you can make a few jam tarts Now there 's still a few breadcrumbs down at the bottom but if I add more water it 'll make it very, it, make it too wet and then of course I 'll have to add more flour to absorb the extra uhm liquid And there 's nothing wrong with that Cos  that happens to us all But once you get to that stage you know, forget about the spoon or the spatula that you 've been mixing and start using your hands And just knead the flour together, whoops, and bring all the little bits in the bowl into the main centre bowl And then, and there we are It comes, comes together And then what you can do is just give it a quick little knead on a lightly dusted flour board, and that 's another thing The more flour you use on your board the more flour you 're putting into your pastry, so then you 're upsetting the balance of the the quantity of flour to fat,  half-and-half you know So  It happens to us all the first time we use a food processor You get carried away you have it there and you 're whizzing at it, Oh this is wonderful And the blades 's whizzing around at such a speed and it 's working away at the flour you know  And it comes out and you really just have, it 's like a shortbread cos it 's  You just sometimes just have to put it into your uhm, your flan tin and just use your hands and work it round It 's very very soft So right, So that 's our our pastry Now if we have time, pop it into a polythene bag, flatten it out a little bit more, and pop it into your fridge and rest it for an hour Or, to even to get it a bit cooler what I would do is flatten it out, put it into your bag and pop it into your freezer for fifteen minutes and turn it after you know seven minutes or so on one side and the heat gets, the cold, the cold uhm gets to <unclear> several sylls </unclear> It 's just whenever you 're making pastry keep everything cool, you know uhm and and that gives you better pastry at the end of the day You stay cool, the pastry 'll stay cool It 's like everything we do, if it starts going wrong  everything falls apart and we 've all had days like that I actually think you make the best pastry whenever you 're under pressure", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "3f76e74f-a32a-4838-ab90-64dd5f732028", "added":

{"text": "<Recipes 1>\n\n\n<$A> Hello I 'm Darina Allen, and I absolutely love cooking, and most of us have to cook every day of our lives anyway, So it 's great if you can actually enjoy it rather than being bored by it, and it 's much easier to enjoy your cooking if you know what you 're doing, So during this series of programmes I 'm going to be showing you how to do lots of simple and delicious recipes, using basic techniques which can be used in all kinds of cooking\n\n<$A> Now I 'm just going to show you how to make one of my favourite starters called crudite/s with garlic mayonnaise Now crudite/s, simply means raw vegetables in French So what we need for this are some perfect delicious crisp vegetables And when I 'm going to make it I just go down to the garden or the greenhouse and choose the vegetables for it very carefully so that they 're very fresh And the, exactly the same applies if you 're going to a shop or greengrocers Look at your vegetables, Think flavour while you 're actually choosing them and if you can feel them and pick up and get the crispest, and freshest ones you can So now I 'm going to show you how to make uh a good homemade mayonnaise And a lot of people think this might take ages but in fact even if you 're making it by hand you can make a mayonnaise well within five minutes So all you need are, first and foremost two egg yolks And I 'll put the egg whites over here cos we 'll keep those and make meringues with them later on, There we are Two egg yolks, And uhm we 'll put a little, about a quarter teaspoon of salt in there, And, some, vinegar as well So, two egg yolks will take a tablespoon of vinegar But I 'm actually going to put in a dessertspoon of vinegar at this stage, And also a little bit of mustard cos that 's got an emulsifying quality And perhaps uhm a little pepper also, There we are If you wanted to be very smart you could actually use white pepper so you wouldn't have any little black specks in it And then I 'm doing it in a see-through bowl so that you can see what 's going to happen And all you need is a little whisk of some kind Now into that two egg yolks then you would drip, And I  I emphasise the word drip uh eight fluid ounces of oil And of course the flavour of your mayonnaise will depend on two things, on the quality of your egg yolks and of course the quality of your oil I 'm using a  very good quality vegetable oil here with a little dash of olive oil in it So start off now by adding in the oil very gradually little drip by drip whisking all the time And at the moment it 's quite thin But in a couple of seconds you 'll see it 'll start to thicken up Now, you must do it nice and slowly in the beginning because otherwise the egg yolk simply won't be able to absorb the oil, So there we are It 's getting lovely and thick now So mayonnaise can be made of course not only by hand but uh in a food   it can be made even faster Or else uh if you want to make it in a liquidiser you could make it with a whole egg, And there we are look, That was pretty fast, Now I 've got to add in the last dessertspoon of wine vinegar In it goes Now if you like you could actually substitute lemon juice for the vinegar at that stage, And that will slightly thin out the mayonnaise for you, The mayonnaise will keep in your fridge Homemade mayonnaise like this will keep in your fridge for say five or six days Uh it doesn't obviously keep indefinitely But five or six days would be perfect So now let me just show you how to deal with the garlic I 've got  two cloves of garlic here, And uh I just usually I don't use a garlic press for this I usually take my knife and press it down like that And then the peel will come off quite easily, And then we make it into a paste, So take a little bit of salt, I have a special board for it cos I don't want, the, everything else to taste of garlic And take your chopping knife like this And then put the weight on the tip of your chopping knife And then make it into a paste like that, There we are, Now for the garlic mayonnaise you can add uhm, as much garlic as you like uhm a large clove of garlic You can add even one to four cloves of garlic depending on how  strong you like it But it really should taste quite garlicky So as soon as you 've made it into a paste pop that into your mayonnaise, In fact I could add a little more as well And then also add a bit of parsley Now the parsley is there to make it more delicious and give it a little bit more colour But you could leave it out if you wanted to So now that 's, a garlic mayonnaise for you there, Now we have some garlic mayonnaise made up in a in a piping bag here So let 's look at the first bowl here first This plate was made actually specially for crudite/s and it has a little bowl attached to the plate in the centre\n\n\n\n<$A> Next I 'm going to show you how to make a completely different kind of starter I 'm going to do a sorbet Now a sorbet is actually a water-ice like an icecream but made completely without cream So you can serve it either as a starter You can serve it as a dessert for example if you had a very creamy main course or something spicy like a curry Or else if you are having a rich meal with four or five courses you could serve it in the old-fashioned sort of way where you have a little sorbet just before the main course just to cleanse your palate and make you feel less full So now it 's very simple All I need is the juice of the grapefruit and some sugar And all you 've got to do is to mix the sugar, into the grapefruit, juice like that, And stir it round Now the pink grapefruit uhm and indeed any grapefruit they uh vary a lot in sweetness So don't add in all the sugar first Taste it and see whether it 's going to be sweet enough Now, this actually needs a bit more sugar because with any sorbet uhm it must taste rather sweeter than you 'd like to eat it before it goes in to freeze because of course it will lose quite a lot of its sweetness in the freezing And you can make sorbet not only from grapefruit juice but from the juice of practically any fruit uh and you can make it all year round as a result And of course you can also make uh sorbets from vegetables for example a tomato sorbet or a cucumber sorbet and even a champagne sorbet So you 've got lots of choice So I need a little bit more sugar in there, Anything from eight to ten ounces of sugar, And taste again, That 's fine now tasting a little sweeter than I 'd like to eat it at this point So now uh that part was is very easy Now there are three different alternatives as far as freezing goes And if you 're one of those very lucky people who actually has an icecream maker or a sorbetie\\re then all you 'd have to do at this point is just take your grapefruit juice uh sweetened grapefruit juice and pop it into your icecream maker, Uh pour it into the barrel, like that with the sugar, And then freeze it for about twenty minutes until it 's quite slushy So the second alternative is to do exactly as I did Mix the sugar with the grapefruit juice And then put it into your freezer or the freezing compartment of your fridge and freeze it for seven or eight hours or even overnight until it 's completely frozen And if you have a food processor, then, break it up, and put it into your food processor, There we are, like that, And then whiz it up, Now with this one you 'll get a texture very similar to the texture you get from the sorbet machine But I usually like to add actually a little egg white in as well just to give it a slightly creamier finish, So, add just a little the uh about one egg white or  slightly less than one egg white for this quantity down through the funnel there And then turn it off, on, and whiz it up, And then you get a very good texture that way as well And in fact you could put that back into your freezer now and serve it later on So then the third way And this is the way most people will want to do it is again grapefruit juice sweetened And then put it into say a stainless steel bowl into your freezer and leave it there for or the freezing compartment of your fridge And then leave it there for say five or six hours until it 's just starting to get slightly frozen round the edges And then take it out And again I have one at that stage here, Take it out then and get just an ordinary whisk We 'll pop that underneath And then break up the slightly frozen crystals around the outside Now this particular sorbet you get a slightly different texture You can hear there that it 's quite sort of slushy, there we are, So, uh whisk in the slightly frozen part from the outside and then put it back in your freezer again and leave it there for another couple of hours And then whisk it up again, Uh you would  I 'd like to serve it with a few little segments of grapefruit round the outside, So uhm I 'm just going to show you how to segment the grapefruit You take a sort of stainless steel knife preferably with a serrated edge and then cut a nice thick slice off the top of the grapefruit right down as far as the flesh And then do it over a bowl, Now hold your knife almost perpendicular and saw, don't push, saw, And don't cut too deep like that, the whole way round, And this is exactly the same way that you would segment oranges for a fruit salad or uh if you needed to segment lemons or any of the citrus fruit, So put that out there, and then hold the grapefruit or whatever it is in your the centre of your hand like that, and cut in front of the membrane, And then just slide off the segment just like that, And if you come across a pip every now and then you can take that out, Exactly the same now for any citrus fruit So that 's a little technique that 's well worth learning, And I 'll use those now you see to put round my little pink grapefruit sorbet Now, you would also have some cold plates in the fridge so you can put your sorbet on it Because basically, uhm uh the sorbet melts fairly quickly, so the  plates should be chilled And I 've got two cold plates here And I also have some uh sorbet that we froze earlier on, And I 'm just going to show you uh one of the ways we present it on the plate, So now, take some of the segments, the little grapefruit segments, and arrange them around the outside, like that These are nice actually cos they have, a little, tinge of pink on the outside, There we are, Get them all more or less going in the same direction, Whoops, I 'm going to take that one back Here we are, like that Pick nice shaped segments, And one more There we are, And then, you need, either uhm a spoon or if you have uhm an icecream scoop you could use that and keep it in warm water And then, get yourself a nice, round scoop of the sorbet, and pop that into the centre like that, And then, you could, decorate it, with a little sprig of fresh mint on top", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Recipes 2>\n\n\n<$A> Now we have all our ingredients ready And I 'm going to show you a marvellous recipe for making homemade soup And this can be adapted to make all sorts of different soups depending on what you have in your larder And in fact what it is it 's really a formula So what I use is one cup of onion, one cup of potato and three cups of any vegetable of your choice and five cups of chicken stock or if you 're really stuck you could use water But I 've actually chosen to do an onion and fine leek soup So I will use, one cup of chopped potatoes and, four cups of chopped onions So what we do is we 'll first and foremost we 'll, melt the butter, So put the butter into the saucepan there, And we 'll get the heat on underneath it, And then, we 'll melt the butter gently, until it actually foams, Now that will take about a minute or so Now you might say to  oh yourself well that 's a waste of time Why can't I just throw in the onions and the potatoes and  put the stock or water in on top of them Well it 's well well worthwhile, sweating the vegetables first Because if you don't sweat them you will just have a sort of slightly boiled onion flavour from your soup in the end So that 's lovely now You can hear the butter just foaming there And add in, first your cup of potato The potato will be the thickener in this soup, And your onions, like that, And then coat them in the butter Toss them around and coat them in butter And now I 'm  going to add a little fresh thyme into it as well If you don't have the thyme leave it out It 'll be a pure/e of onion soup And it 'll still be delicious, So, the vegetables coated there in the butter And teaspoon of fresh thyme leaves going in, Toss them round And then don't forget the seasoning And always season with your fingers rather than throwing it in with a spoon because you 've got much more control if you do it with your fingers And also the great thing is to get the seasoning in early on so that it 's well absorbed into the soup You can sort of correct the seasoning at the end but you can never quite make up for the fact that you forgot about it altogether So now this should be put on a gentle heat Because the term sweating of vegetables simply means that you cook the vegetables, over a low heat for about say eight or ten minutes until they 're, cooked but not coloured And then if you actually put a little paper lid or a butter wrapper on top well then that will produce a nice steamy atmosphere in and there and then they 'll sweat better for you So I have a bit of greaseproof paper here I 've folded it in half and then into quarters Then fold it over again, and again And now you 're making what 's called a paper lid Into the centre, and then let 's tear off the back part off it there, so that you have a little paper lid which fits down on top like that, Then we put the lid on top And then make sure that you turn it on to a gentle heat So that would take five six minutes And, while they 're cooking don't try to hurry it up otherwise they will uhm colour on you That 's not what you want While they 're cooking I 'll just show you how to chop uhm an onion properly and how and also how to chop a potato Because you know there 's a right and a wrong way of doing all these things So the first thing to do is to peel your onion And make sure you keep the root end intact because that will actually keep the onion together when you 're chopping it Sharp knife, that 's the other thing And then cut the onion, like that, to put uh half over there and then put it from you with the root end towards your left hand And then, slice, like that, not quite the whole way through And then turn it round and then, again, slice like that There we are, Now don't put your fingers out like that If you do you cut the top off them Keep them back in, and then, cut, like, that, there we are Now chopping a potato is the other thing Cut a slice off the side of the potato like that And then, cut, down like that Now you see you can flip it over Then cut it down like that, like that Let 's have a look and see whether these uhm onions are sweated, There we are that 's ready Put that out there, And now we just add in, our, chicken stock, That 's nice homemade chicken stock I have there So bring that up to the boil and cook it until the uh potato will mash off the side of the saucepan Then you can either serve it like that if you want to if you like a soup with lots of bits in it Or else you could rub it through a sieve if want to Or else you could pop it into a liquidiser and pure/e it that way And I 've already got uhm a soup uh liquidised here, Because I want to just finally taste this soup So uhm uh what I would add to it if you wanted to make it a tiny little bit richer I would add just a little tiny drop of cream or some creamy milk, And then of course, most importantly, taste it, Mm hmm that 's very good I 'm just going to give it another little tiny pinch of salt, That 's super Now any time I 'm making soup instead of uh just, putting it straight into the bowl I quite like to serve it actually in a soup tureen Because uh even if uh you 're serving just for a lovely family meal at home if you could put it into a big bowl or soup tureen then somehow or other it makes much more of a sort of occasion of it And when you 're making homemade soup it 's always worth making at least twice the recipe because you know you can always freeze it anyway And if you have soup in the house well you 're absolutely never be stuck Because if you come home weary from shopping or from work all you have to do is heat up a bowl of soup And it 's cheap and cheerful and absolutely delicious and nutritious And what more could you ask for\n\nThe next recipe would be wonderful for a special occasion It 's called smoked uh salmon timbale with a cucumber and fennel salad And what we need for this are about six slices of beautifully thin smoked salmon And what we 're going to do is we 're going to line little ramekins, small ramekins about this size with a little clingfilm first and foremost Now don't have the little dishes much bigger than this you could use egg cups if you want to But whatever happens don't make the portions too large cos we 're going to fill this with quite a rich mousse And then take a thin slice of smoked salmon, and, line the ramekin with that, just like that Now I 've already lined another four there, earlier on So, the centres of those are going to be filled with this delicious mousse I told you about And to make the mousse for the centre you need about four ounces of chopped up smoked salmon It could be from the tail piece or it could be smoked salmon trimmings or you could even use a mixture of smoked trout and smoked salmon And pop that into a food processor just to uh pure/e it up And as well as that I would add a little uhm, about an ounce of butter, there we are, And uhm let 's, give that whiz that for a second, there we are Now the other ingredient that you may not be familiar with here is fresh horseradish And do you realise that fresh horseradish grows all around the countryside in the ditches wild And it looks a little bit like dock leaves but the leaves are slightly longer and they 're a darker green And of course you have to dig it up and it 's the root that you actually eat So all you have to do is, get the root like that And then, peel off the, outer skin Of course give it a good wash and make sure you get the clay off first And then take a grater, and just grate the horseradish, finely like that, just like that, as much as you want And I 've already got some grated here so I 'll use this So about a tablespoon of fresh horseradish if you have it Now if you haven't got horseradish you can leave it out But it does give a little zing to this mousse Tablespoon there we are, And then we 'll also add in, about five fluid ounces of cream, And perhaps, a little uhm tiny, squeeze of lemon juice But let 's taste it first, Mmm, needs a little drop or two of lemon juice Do it to taste Uhm it very seldom needs salt because uh the smoked salmon is usually quite salty, there we are, Final taste make sure it 's okay Mmm, that 's delicious When you 've got the mousse made and when it 's nice and light, just take the little ramekin and fill the centre with the mousse, like that Not too much in because when it turns out, it wants to be nice and flat on the bottom, That in there Then fold in, the little pieces of smoked salmon like that And then clingfilm over the top And you 'd put those into your fridge And you could serve them later in the day or they could be made be made a day or two days ahead of time So I 'll put those into the fridge now, And I 've already got one made here, which I 'll show you how to present in a second But first and foremost I must make the little cucumber in fennel salad to go round the edge of my plate Pop that underneath, there we are, Now, so for this salad I 'm going to make uh a little French dressing This is a classic French dressing which would be one tablespoon, of, wine vinegar The, classic French dressing is one to three usually So one tablespoon wine vinegar, there, And about three, tablespoons, of, sunflower oil, Or it could be a little sunflower oil and olive oil mixed It 's going to be a light dressing, And uhm  slice your cucumber quite finely, And toss that in there nice thin slices a bit like that, And, toss them round in the dressing,  apart from that we 'll add, a little salt, a little pepper, and also a little tiny pinch of sugar, like that And then a little sprinkle of fennel Now this herb has a mild anis-seedy flavour And it 's very good with cucumber And this is what fennel looks like when it 's growing It 's a  lovely feathery herb, Arrange some of your pieces of cucumber, around the plate like this This can look very pretty very easily, Lift out the little salmon mousse and pop it into the centre like that Now, that looks very pretty as it is But if you like you can garnish it with uhm some little sprigs of parsley or sprigs of chervil Also you could use if you like, some little herb flowers, So you could use the flowers of the fennel They would be wonderful And I have some of those here", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Flowers>\n\n\n<$A> Hello there Welcome once again to a brand new series of How Do You Do Well it 's great to see you all again, and uh I think I look more or less the same but we have a little bit of a transformation here in our set or our room, because as you can see it has been transformed to an extent We 've painted all our walls in a bright peach and some lovely blue all around the windows and the doors and I think it looks brighter and better than ever before Well we 've lots of great things lined up for you to make on this series starting today with some lovely colourful flowers And uh we have them here on the table And we 've first of all got these lovely lilies in white and green and some bits of yellow sticking out And then behind them we 've got the bright colourful sun  flowers uh with the yellow crepe paper And then my favourite of the bunch are all these lovely poppies in red And uh finally in front we 've got some nice colourful pansies So we 'll try and get around to making some if not all of those flowers today but as usual if you remember last year we always started the show by telling you all the little bits and pieces that you need So the main ingredients for today are uh brightly coloured crepe paper in different colours as you can see here on the table We also need uh lots of sticks These are garden sticks you can get in any garden centre and some wire Okay So uh we 'll get down to business straight away We might as well not waste time and we 'll make the poppies Now we start with a piece of uh red crepe paper and uh we cut it into a size like that Then we 'll get uhm a marker, and uh we draw a shape which rather resembles a big tongue, So uh we draw round like that, and uh then we get our scissors, and we cut it out, Okay, and uh cut around the end So basically what you 're doing really is just cutting all around the black lines, So, you end up with a whole load of uh red petals and they 're all going to form the petals uh of your flower All right So we leave those aside for a minute and we 'll go back to making the actual centre Now the centre will uh is made with uh first of all a garden stick and then you get a bunch of uh green crepe paper like that Then you get another little bit like this,  you can gather it around here And uh then you get a piece of garden wire And uh this is more like florist 's wire It 's very thin wire You can get it in garden centres or flower shops If you haven't got the wire you could use uhm a piece of twine or a bit of string or wool instead So wrap it around like that And then, you get your marker, and you draw, lines, down the centre, a bit like in fact drawing spiders ' legs, Okay, like that, so that uh you will end up with one which is slightly neater and uh looks like that All right So we put that aside and the next thing we have to do then is get some black crepe paper And what I 've done with the black crepe paper is I 've cut it into a small strip first of all and then I just fringed it And that 's done by just cutting your scissors into the crepe paper down like that Now you don't in fact go the full way You sort of leave that bit there So what we 'll do is we open it out Just find an opening for it, wherever it is, Uhm I 'll tell you what we 'll just cut into it so we get an opening, Open it out, and, we keep a little piece there, and then we 'll get some glue, and we put some glue, on the end, of our, centre piece, and then, get the black, and we start to roll around like that Okay And uh when you come to the very end then just get another dab of glue, and, stick it like that there Alright Now, at this stage we go back to our petals And as I said we have a right bunch of them there And we take each individual petal in our hand and we put our two thumbs, in the centre, and we just stretch the paper slightly Do the same with this one Stretch, and, stretch And you do that altogether with about twelve petals So all we do then is, put some glue, on the end of each petal Glue it on to the centre Let it set Get some more glue, on to the petal, and glue it on there, and let it set And you do the same thing the whole way around Keep going around like that Now you keep going around until eventually your, flower is full or filled up should I say with lots of petals We 'll just add one more on for good measure So uh stretching it in the centre we stick it on there Okay So all we do at this stage then is we get a piece of green crepe paper cut into a strip, a long piece into a strip, and uh we get our glue, and put the glue, around the top part, and again down there, on a little bit on a stick And we just, put the crepe paper in there, like that And then, wrap it around Stick it on Wrap it around there, and, keep just, rolling it, down along the stem, like this, and, when you come more or less, to the end, of your stem Now we haven't got quite enough to finish this one off but I 'll just show you how you finish it off Just coming towards the end put a little bit of glue at the end there, and roll it round once more, and glue it on Okay Now we have one here, which uh we have fully, covered There 's the stem all covered like this Alright So uh all we do at this stage is make some leaves, and the leaves very simply are made on green crepe paper And what you 're doing really is cutting out a zigzag shape Now just cut up and down like this And when I say a zigzag shape I don't mean that uh you draw a Zig and Zag but a shape like this Alright So uh you draw the shape like that Then you get your scissors and you cut out all around the black lines And uh you should end up with a bunch of leaves like those Okay So you take each individual leaf in your hand, get a little bit of glue, go back to your flower, and catch it there in the centre There like that And uh if you want to add on another one, just get, another leaf,  more glue Just move down a little bit down the stem And uh, you glue it on there like that Alright So the final thing you do with this flower is just, open out all the petals, to, reveal, your lovely centre inside And then if you 've got a nice painted jam jar or a nice vase you can pop it in and uh there you go with your first flower So those are the poppies and uh, I must say they 're my favourite Now moving fairly quickly on to the next one we will make a sunflower this time And uh we start again with the, petals And what I have actually done is, I won't draw it out for you because I have it already drawn on a piece of yellow crepe paper this time Cut a piece about that size and then draw a, shape up and down like that Again a zig and zag shape rather like Indian feathers on a headband Cut them out, and uh you 'll end up with that idea Right Now we go back to the centre And the centre is uh the same idea really as we did with uhm the poppies We just put on a ball this time of green crepe paper or should I say we put green on the poppies with brown this time, and a little bit of brown paper over it And uh you can see our little fluffy bits there And what I did really with that was I just put some glue We 'll just do it again Put some glue chopped up some brown crepe paper in a bowl, and then, dipped it in And uh it 's a bit like having some chocolate flake, alright, on the top of the your flower So uh we leave that one aside to dry, and uh we 've got this one here So all we do then is, we open out our leaves, and uh we put, well these are not actually leaves They 're petals really But uh I get them mixed up sometimes when I 'm, saying one thing and another So we just uh put a bit of glue as you see there, uh stick it on And then all you do is a rolling process So you keep rolling along like that Okay, until eventually you get the whole lot of this on And uh when you have the whole lot on, your uh flower should look like that, just a big bunch out like that, okay Now what I 've done just to make sure that it 's a little bit secure is I got a little piece of the thin wire and I wrapped it around there but you again can use string or a bit of wool to do the same thing So once more we go and uh we get a strip of green crepe paper And we just get a strip here, cut it off, the green crepe paper Excuse me Dropped it on the floor And uh we put a little bit of glue around the top part of our flower And uh, all we do then is just, wrap it around like this, And, the same wrapping process as we did with the poppy, so that eventually when you come to your end, you will end up with your flower completely covered up like the one I have here in my hand Okay Well the final thing we have to do then are to make some leaves for it And uh the leaves are done, very simply by getting first of all a piece of wire,  I 'm using a little thicker piece this time, and then cutting out again from your crepe paper uhm a bunch of green leaves And uh, what you do is you take two leaves for each one if you know what I mean there 's two And you put a little bit of glue, in the centre of the leaf, and stick on your wire, down like that And uh put another dabs of glue just round the rest of it And stick the other one on top like this, like that And uh, so you end up with the leaf that looks like that Now you 'd want to make three or four uh for your sunflower So uh when you 've made them you just get, uhm your wire Now I have very thin wire on this one So wrap it around several times, like this And uh, we 'll add on another one, just down here a little bit, like that, okay And uh, the idea with the wire is then that you can bend the flowers up, or you can bend them back down again if they 're uhm a sad or a happy sunflower But these are happy sunflowers today so we 'll put all the leaves sitting up nice and brightly Okay So finally all we have to do is just to open out our uhm, petals And once more, we reveal, our lovely chocolate brown centre, inside Okay So that 's our sunflower And uh we 'll put it in there beside the poppy", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "a08b0b04-31b5-4a34-b503-5fa72ca56168", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.372225+00:00"}
{"text": "<Candles>\n\n\n<$A> Hello there and you 're very welcome to our final programme before Christmas Well today we 're going to make candles And in fact it 's rather a repeat of one that I did last year because it was so popular, and so many of you wrote in wanting to know how to do the candles that I said I had to do them all over again So we have a variety of candles here on display on the table They 're all lit at the moment, So of course when you light candles always be very careful And uh I 'll just show them to you very quickly First of all we have these ones They 're called uh rock candles And they 're in bright colours pink and yellow there Then uh we have a variety of striped ones Here are the striped ones here, look like that lots of different colours and they look very well And uh we also have ones which are, we call sand-cast candles and here they are in front And if you hold them up there you can see that they 're all coated with uh sand underneath so they give them a sort of a sand covering and that 's why they 're called sand-cast candles And then finally we have sort of more conventional ones, these ones here uhm in various different shapes, round ones and, rectangular ones and various ones like that And they 're made from sort of conventional moulds So those are the candles And uh as usual if you 'd like to come over with me here, and uh we 'll show you all the bits and pieces that you need And this week you might need to do a little bit of shopping because I 'm sure you won't have a lot of the ingredients at home But uh we 'll show you what 's uh on display here and then you can decide what you need The first thing you need is some candle wax And uh you can either buy it in a bag like this in crystal form, it looks a bit like a bag of sugar, or you can actually buy just ordinary white candles that you can get in a supermarket or a hardware shop and melt them down Now a lot of people had problems last year saying they couldn't get this wax, so don't worry if you can't get this wax, just get this sort of stuff The next thing you need is some candle wick You 'll get that in most craft shops, Then you need ordinary crayons, any crayons that 's used for colouring Uhm you need some tin cans empty tin cans, some wooden clothes pegs It 's better to use the wooden ones than the plastic ones cos they tend to melt You also need some uhm paper cups or you can use yoghurt cartons or cream cartons You need a milk carton and uh you need a bucket of sand or a basin of sand Just something to hold some sand in So uhm, that 's the first things that you need Now the, starting off what you have to do is you have to sort of set yourself up and you decide what colours you 're going to use And uh you start with your, uhm bag of wax, and you need an empty tin can So, you put some, wax, into the tin can, and uh just fill it about that much a sort of a little thickish layer at the end of the can And uh we 'll put this wax away cos we won't need it any more for the moment And then you decide on what colours you want So say we 're going to do a pink one You get your pink crayon and you tear off the paper You don't use the papers, and uh, tear it off, all gone and then just break it in half, so that uh it 's like that in the top of the wax And all you do then is get uhm a wooden clothes peg and clip it on there And the wooden the reason we use the wooden ones is the the if you use the plastic ones they tend to melt And you have to  have already set up on your cooker, uhm a saucepan of, uh boiling water And you sort of turn it down to a simmer but uhm, make sure that the water is fairly hot and be very careful when you 're doing this Now I 'll just, clip, the can, down to the side, uh of, the, uhm saucepan, like that So I have a variety of different colours set up there I have pink and green and blue and orange and that 's the way we go So we decide  we 're going to do the first ones are striped candles and we 're going to use a paper cup So we start off with the paper cup And then you can cut some some wick, and make the wick, uh taller than the actual, uhm paper cup So put a little bit of masking tape on the end of it You can also use sellotape if you don't have this masking tape but the masking tape, tends to work a little bit better So then you get a pencil Oops this is sticking to the end here  get a pencil, and uh flatten it down inside like this, like that, okay And uh, all you do then is uh you get your pencil, and then, you roll it, around like this several times, So, you 're using it, like that so it rests on the top of the cup And then you get some more masking tape or sellotape whichever, and uh you just keep it down like that So that 's how you set up for the actual uh striped candles Now the next thing you do, is that you decide say at this stage that uh some of your wax has melted So uhm we 'll just, stir around here, different cans and we have some here And uh say we 'll start with some green wax So you go over to, your can and uh try and use, uhm an oven glove or something, to hold the can because it will be very hot So just mix it around with a little stick, and then, pour in, a layer, like that So you just put in half a layer really, just a small layer at the end, and uh you leave that aside and you let it set So we 'll just put this candle over here, and you let it set And then when that has set you would add in another layer of wax and then you let that set So that uh eventually, you will come to the stage where your cup is nearly filled up with wax There 's some green wax And a good idea really is to put a little uhm notice on the front Stick a bit of paper onto the front of your cup and put down the different colours Say one is going to be blue two red green or whatever So we 're going to put the final coat on top of that And uh I think uh we 'll top it off with some orange wax So we have, some orange wax melted here And this one has come off slightly so we 'll just pin it on, So we make the  orange wax Uhm, melt it round like this, and then, top off the candle, top like that Okay So there you see your orange wax Alright So again you leave that to set And you really have to leave it to set for about an hour or so, until eventually hopefully uhm it 's, completely uhm set So all we do then is we just bring over our candles We 've some here that we 've already set earlier on, and uhm, you just roll off this part here Take off the the wick and then you can get your scissors, and uh trim the wick, like that, and then, you can, cut open the paper cup Now be careful, so that uh, And there you can see, the various different colours, coming to light Okay So there you 've got a very nice, striped candle We 'll just do  quickly with this one, to give us another idea Trim off the wick, take off the pencil And uh, just cut into the top of the cup, and we 'll just see what colours uh this one reveals, All sorts of greens and, blues, and, purples So uh, there 's another one And uh there you 've got two nice striped candles So those are the first ones And we 'll set all these aside, and uh we 'll move the candles over here for the moment Now the second ones we 're going to do, are the ones with the sand And you start off with the bucket of sand or any sort of a container really which will hold sand You get a little bit of wick, and uh, you put the wick in there, And you roll it round the top, uh, top of your stick And then get a little bit of masking tape once more And uh this is fairly simple You make a hole as I have done there, with the spoon See the hole I 've made there with the spoon I just uh pressed that out there with the spoon And all you have to do then is uhm to get your wax, and say we decide this is going to be a blue one, you have some blue, wax melting away here So we just lift out the blue wax, take off the peg, if you want to, hold it up, and then, pour it in like that, Now, that should be enough, to there And uh you really in fact have to leave these uh sand-cast ones to, set overnight So that uh we 'll just put it aside here And the wax has just gone a little bit running around the sand, but eventually, uhm when it 's set overnight it should uh look like this one here, fairly solid So all we do is once more, just uh roll off your pen or whatever you have, holding up the wick, trim if off, and then, get a spoon, and dig it out, So now you see you 've got a a nice coating of sand all around the back of the candle, and uh that 's what it looks like in front So that 's called a sand-cast candle And I 'll put it down there beside the striped ones Okay So they 're very simple to do Uh the next ones, are with uh the milk carton And uh you need in fact for this, a a candle that you can buy in uh a supermarket, the ordinary white candles I was telling you to use if you don't get the candle wax Get that, say cut it into half, get your milk carton and cut it down to around that size Okay Uh you also need some ice cubes for this Well we 'll start first of all, uhm, with our wax So we 'll start say with some red wax here And what you do is, take the wax off, lift off the peg Be gentle You pour a little bit of wax, into, the end of uh your carton Then you get in your candle, and you set it in, and the wax should hold on to it And then what you do is you get your ice cubes, a bowl of ice cubes, and you start to, fill up all around the candle, with some ice cubes Okay, So uh, we 're just filling it up here with ice cubes, oops, and around here Your hands will be fairly cold after all this And uh there you go We should have uh enough ice cubes around that You can sort of leave the candle sticking up a bit Okay so, finally what you do then with this one is, you go back to get your wax again, and then you just pour it all over, the ice cubes, And you can even pour it round the candle a little bit, And in fact, the uh wax sets pretty quickly because uhm, the ice actually harden its hardens it So uh, there you go Have a look at it like that Alright So now you actually have to leave those to set overnight as well And uh when they are set overnight, you should end up, with I have two here one in orange and one in pink And uh you 'll begin to see that there 's water coming to the top of them And what actually has happened is that the ice has melted, and all these bubbly shapes you  you see there, they have all been formed by the ice cubes So what you do is then you go over to your sink, and uh, you just pour out the water Just empty them out, It should be, more or less emptied out now And then we just go back, and get our scissors once more, and, start to cut, and then take off And uh you get a really nice shaped  These ones are my favourite I must say They 're called rock candles cos you get very interesting shapes, and uh they sort of look different each time", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Skiing>\n\n\n<$A>  What we 'd like to achieve in block four, is a practical understanding of the use of the edge How as it runs smoothly it controls our direction, and how friction against it gives us a good braking action And we 'd like you to try a snow plough It 's here you can develop your stance, and a good solid base to use the edge from\n<$A>  Side stepping uphill is just like walking sideways up a staircase facing the wall If you feel yourself slipping sideways down the slope, push your knees in towards the slope as you step This will give you a good platform to make your next step from Place your poles below you, and use them for support as you turn around to face downhill, with your skis pointing in the direction you want to go Relax and glide down the hill Choose one with a gentle run out at the bottom, to bring you gradually to a standstill If not then just step around as you did on the flat, Place your poles in the snow below you about shoulder width apart, with palms on top of your poles, and with straight arms, make a step turn to point down the hill, with your skis positioned between your poles Remember to look ahead, and stay flexed as you glide down hill,\n<$A>  So far you 've been gliding straight downhill We call this shussing The next step is to learn to control your speed and stop when you want to, with a snow plough,\n<$A>  Set yourself up in a narrow snow plough Check that you 're flexed at all the skiing joints Notice, that you should be travelling slower than in the straight running position A few metres down the slope push out the ski tails and sink down a little, pushing wider into a braking plough Equalising your pressure will ensure that you don't drift to one side, Sinking down into a wide plough gives greater braking Experiment with your position and see what happens\n<$A>  Look at the team using their poles as markers to brake beside Visualise on this, maybe try it yourself\n\n<$A>  There 's more to skiing than on-snow techniques For a start you 'll give yourself a much better chance of progress if you 're prepared physically If you don't have the strength and stamina to continue skiing then you 'll be wasting part of your precious holiday time\n\n<$A>  You need three areas of fitness Aerobic, that 's lung capacity to process oxygen, and ensure the stamina to keep going Strength, that being the muscle power to sustain the movements and postures required by skiing, and flexibility, an absolute must, both for avoiding injury and recovering from those near misses, Let 's just think about what you could work on right now, before you ever hit the slopes Try to plan a simple routine that encompasses these three areas of fitness Make a gentle start, unless you 're already quite fit by going for a walk Rocky ground develops good balance and sharpens reactions whilst strengthening your ankles If the ground is undulating, you will be working on all three areas When you get to the ski resort the first adjustment your body will make aerobically is to the increased altitude Your blood will set about producing more red corpuscles to help supply you with oxygen The best advice is not to push yourself too hard on day one, But for now why not think mountains and walk amongst the hills where the air is fresher Look around and develop an awareness of your environment There 's more to see than you realise It 's good fun, and a great way of unwinding\n\n<$A>  Cycling provides an excellent aerobic preparation for skiing, and in addition it will improve leg strength and balance But perhaps the best thing about getting out on your bike is that it is a non-weight bearing form of training that won't damage knees or other joints\n\n<$A>  Graduate to jogging which is a little more strenuous when you 've built up some stamina and strength during your walks and cycle rides Take it all at your own pace, Jogging could become the base of your own creative ski exercise plan, using nothing more than a few obstacles to run in and out of, like a slalom off snow\n\n\n<$A>  There are a lot of elements to digest in block five It slots together all the basic ingredients of using skis, a running edge, a turning edge, and a frictional braking edge The side slip will be explained as a useful and necessary compromise whenever you can't let the skis run along their edges, and there will be more work on stance, seeing how the body follows the skis round the turn, not the skis following the body Your main goal for this block is to get your skis to make turns as efficiently as possible, with a minimum of effort from you, getting the most out of the ski\n<$A>  To recap, we looked in block one at how the ski turns In block two, we got used to our skis Block three gave us a well balanced stance over the ski Block four added the snow plough into the equation and put us well placed to use either of our turning edges So now we need to add in the adjustment in stance and pressure, that the skier makes to trigger the turn The snow plough turn gives you the very best chance to develop a good relationship between your centre of mass, that 's the hip area and the edge of the ski which is going to make the turn Think of every turn as being part of the arc of a circle You will hold an edge and control an edge if your centre of mass is towards the inside of the circle The amount will vary according to the radius of the turn and your speed, and you should experiment with this, before you finish the block To get your skis to carry you through a snow plough turn you need to stand, that is put most of your weight on the inside edge of one ski If you stand on your left ski, you will turn right, If you stand on your right ski, you will turn left, In this illustration the red ball represents the centre of mass which is your hip area Note the track that your hip takes relative to the ski in order to hold you well balanced on your ski 's inside edge You will be standing on the inside edge, if your centre of mass is to the inside of your turning arc The principle of holding an edge by keeping the hip to the inside of the turn, is the same for all turns as we 'll show you in block six, but, it 's easier to learn using the edge at the snow plough stage where, because of the V shape we make, our hips are already, inside the turn, whichever ski we press on, and at slower speeds we have the additional support of the non-turning ski Groove this into your technique now, rather than trying to rush towards parallels This building block, is perhaps the most important\n<$A>  Sometimes continuous turns won't give you the line you want To track across the slope you need to learn the traverse\n<$A>  Face across the slope and look ahead Your feet should be hip width apart, and your weight more on the downhill ski If you had just finished a turn, this would be the ski you are standing on already Your hips will be to the inside of the working ski Carry your hands wide for balance, and always practise in both directions\n<$A>  The side slip is extremely useful whenever the skis cannot be allowed to run along their edges Use it to scrub off speed, or to come slowly in a more direct line down the mountain\n<$A>  Advance your upper ski slightly, which lets you turn your upper body from the hips to face down the slope Allow the knees to relax out, by rolling them downhill Your skis will no longer be held on their edges, and will be flat enough to slide The diagonal side slip, works on the same principle Just look where you 're going, and be sure to focus shoulders waist and hips in that direction, releasing the edges to get a slide\n<$A>  Improve your snow plough turns by visualising on these demonstrations\n\n<$A>  Phew, in block six we 'd like to add a little variety to the radius of your turns, by improving your directional control and use of the edge Your aim is to pick a route, select a place to turn, and adapt your turn to the radius you want to achieve Let 's have a look at some wedge turns\n<$A>  A wedge turn is the result of refining your snow ploughs and controlling your radius You will need to experiment with pressure, pressing harder and quicker on the turning ski shortens the radius Pressing more gently lengthens the radius of the turn Always think of locating the edge, then pressing smoothly It 's simple Change pressure, change direction, Notice, as the speed increases, how the non-turning ski tends to drift in towards the turning one If you concentrate on the amount of pressure you are applying to the turning ski, you will find that, at a reasonable speed, the non-turning ski drifts in quite naturally, to what looks like a traverse position\n<$A>  No two turns are ever identical One of the main variants is radius Focus your attention on radius, in the next few turns\n<$A>  Remember, the quicker you locate the new turning edge and press in the middle, the quicker you will turn The gentler you press, the longer the radius will be,\n<$A>  Now use this to complete your mental picture of wedge turns\n\n<$A>  The best way we 've found for getting the feeling of using the new edge as early as possible in each turn is to use a small step\n<$A>  A narrow step out with the ski which is going to make the next turn, gives you the best opportunity to find its inside edge as early as possible Pressing early on the new turning edge gives a precise turn, with lots of control Don't wait until you 've made a big traverse before starting each turn Aim to let them flow together, transferring the pressure smoothly and rhythmically\n<$A>  Making a step turn like this, the turn develops smoothly and efficiently Once started, your aim must be not to disrupt the turning process Standing up for example, would flatten the skis\n<$A>  See how the ski is stepped out, into a narrow wedge As the ski touches down, find its inside edge and press in the middle Increasing the pressure on the new turning ski means decreasing the pressure on the other The pressure that you apply to the inside edge, around the middle of the ski is, turning pressure As the turn develops, encourage the inside ski to drift in As you complete the arc, release the turning pressure by relaxing the ankle flex Your height will increase slightly in this release phase, but don't think of standing up\n<$A>  We 'll be doing more work on pole plant in the future But for now let 's look at adding it in, to our step turn,\n<$A>  A good pole plant won't throw your balance or disrupt your rhythm, but isn't necessary until you 're moving at a moderate pace If used well, the pole plant is a good aid to getting rhythm into your turns, and helps to trigger a change of pressure to your new turning edge Try to develop a natural timing for use of the pole Develop a wrist only action, not letting your arms or shoulders get involved Use your wrist to cock the pole forward as you lift the ski out into a step The pole goes in, at the moment you start to press on the new ski Make a gentle pole plant, and immediately lift the pole out again, with a forward and down wrist movement Keep the upper body relaxed, and don't look down at your pole plant Look ahead Say to yourself, lift, plant and press, Lift, plant and press, Lift, plant and press,\n<$A>  This visualisation on step turns should help your timing and rhythm\n\n<$A>  We 've told you heaps of things about skiing, but it should be said that perhaps the most important elements of your ski holiday are, safety, enjoyment and learning, in that order Good skiing and see you soon", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "790651c8-0074-4934-ad85-54dfc6f7e38b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.374469+00:00"}
{"text": "<Slander case>\n\n\n<$A> Can I turn uh My Lord to the Notice for Particulars, uhm page six and also the Replies uh on page fifteen If it please Your Lordship uhm the <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> case You will see My Lord at five three, uhm the words used to make the false accusation are as follows, the girl was in receipt of items bought, petrol was bought at the same time but was not paid for, <unclear> several sylls </unclear> So it wasn't actually the word theft used and in fact the defendant <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> for this application, there wasn't an accusation of theft made, it was just simply that you drove off, you forgot to pay <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Uhm  I want to move now  uh to line six the defendant cannot say precisely how many other customers were in the filling station when the accusation was made In the second set of Replies if Your Lordship pleases, if you turn to page twenty-one, she would then say at that stage that she believes that reply one there were at least three or four customers in the premises And uhm that reply two of the second Replies, she says that she believes\n<$B>  what was question two I see the reply What was question two\n<$A> I think it was how many people heard\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Uhm it stated approximately the number of customers that the plaintiff believes could have heard the words and uhm she believes that the exchange was a short distance from those other customers so it, the height of her case is that there was publication to three or four people She doesn't allege any reaction by those people Turning back to the first set of Replies, uhm she says at seven <unclear> several sylls </unclear> customers, and at eight, this is dealing with the damage to her reputation, it says her reputation had been damaged and an accusation had been made in that she was a dishonest person who made off without paying for petrol The plaintiff is a district nurse of unblemished character, enjoys the highest reputation in her neighbourhood and beyond and such words of accusation severely tarnished that reputation Having said that if you read nine <unclear> several sylls </unclear> Now if Your Lordship pleases, it doesn't plead uh any adverse reaction spoken to her or of any evidence that she can have of any such incident So it is\n<$B> Sorry of any\n<$A> Of of any such incident, that that any evidence can be given of such as one of the customers telling somebody else and making a comment about it And as she is a district nurse out and about in the locality, one would have thought if there had been any adverse effect, at least one person would have mentioned it to her, and that of course then would have been pleaded And at reply eleven, the plaintiff says she was probably kept and detained at the said premises <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> for about five minutes So that would appear to be the, the height of, the length of the incident And she then goes on at reply twelve, <unclear> several sylls </unclear> The Plaintiff was compelled to remain in the premises despite having no wish to do so And fourteen, it 's not alleged that any words were expressed <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and her freedom of movement thereby inhibited Uhm, if Your Lordship pleases, again turning to the second set of Replies on page uhm twenty-one, uhm reply three if Your Lordship, pleases my question I asked <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> precise particulars of the explanation of the plaintiff <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> of her innocence This is a matter of evidence The Plaintiff cannot remember the precise <unclear> several syllables </unclear> the car registration was written in manuscript on the receipt <unclear> several sylls </unclear> By reason of these clear assertions of her innocence the Plaintiff made it obvious that she had been quite freely and correctly identified by the two individuals She provided a full explanation of her innocence and the circumstances in which it was clear to her that the two accusers did not believe her protestations of innocence But still, if Your Lordship pleases, uhm the words of accusation are as clear as the first reply, petrol was got at the same time but was not paid for She doesn't allege that her accusers as she describes them went on to say, that 's wrong or we don't accept your explanation, or anything of that nature <unclear> several sylls </unclear> she believes she was touched on the shoulder So, in in my submission, if Your Lordship pleases, in terms of any slander, at most the publication, <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> was three or four people It appears to have been not one but two sentences set out in the Replies In my submission it was nothing other than uhm an invitation to the court to infer some damage to her reputation But we 've got no specific evidence of that and in my submission, it would appear that she may well be be, at at the height of her claim, entitled to nominal damages for the slander Or if it 's more than that it 'll be something very very modest indeed And if she establishes uh false imprisonment, uhm the damages to which she 'll be entitled for less than five minutes uh would in my submission be in the order of a few hundred pounds and therefore this is a case which uh clearly uh could rest comfortably in the County Court\n<$B> Yes\n<$C> My Lord the jurisdiction for slander in the County Court is three thousand pounds And my respectful\n<$B> In slander is it\n<$C> In slander That 's the plaintiff 's main cause of action My Lord and I submit that there are several causes of action but the main cause of action here is clearly slander It is a modest amount My Lord and in my respectful submission there are a number of features in this case which indicate that that modest amount would not be sufficient I appreciate My Lord that if the matter is remitted to the County Court judge <unclear> several sylls </unclear> that figure of three thousand pounds, but then for this court to apply My Lord is, for the three thousand pounds uhm could properly uhm compensate the plaintiff in all the circumstances There are a number of features My Lord in my respectful submission which indicate that the slander in this case is sufficient uhm to keep the matter in the High Court, that there is the, the unchallenged uh pleading that the plaintiff is a lady, forty-six years of age of unblemished character She 's a district nurse in the locality, the incident occurred close to her home It was an incident which occurred in full public view, there was no attempt My Lord, nor is it pleaded that there was any attempt by the defendant to bring the plaintiff into a private area to make uhm the assertions to her which were made Uhm in relation to the assertions which in fact were made My Lord, the reply in relation to the Further and Better Particulars twenty-six indicates a challenge for the purposes of <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> My Lord, that there were a number of matters which the plaintiff protested uhm in her innocence Uhm uh, in relation to biscuits, in relation to the car registration number, in relation to the coat that she was wearing, in relation to the fact that diesel was taken and not unleaded petrol In my respectful submission My Lord <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> the flavour certainly of conversation whereby, or of an incident whereby uhm her protestation of innocence is not immediately accepted uhm and if it is accepted at all, which we say it wasn't, it was very grudgingly accepted The position My Lord also\n<$B> There was an apology Is that right\n<$C> Well it it is, it, the defendants drafted it in terms that there was an apology uhm the plaintiff 's case uhm is that an apology in rather grudging terms was made not by the manageress of the shop who was the main accuser, but in fact by the assistant who had come over to her But she would say that the apology was made at the end of this uh rather lengthy and unpleasant conversation uhm and it was one which was made grudgingly and it was not a fulsome apology as one would have expected My Lord what I would say in relation to uh the plaintiff 's case in terms of the spread of the slander, it would appear that at its height there may only have been three or four people The plaintiff can't be absolutely sure for her mind was distracted, and not, to the number of customers about But if there were only three or four people about, it doesn't mean My Lord of course that those three or four people had not overheard what had been said and not talked among themselves It 's a small community uhm and the mere fact that the plaintiff cannot give evidence at this stage My Lord that someone had approached her and said oh I heard you were accused of stealing petrol, it 's unlikely in my respectful submission that someone would say that to her It 's quite obviously, yes My Lord, that someone might know that about her and not say it or be too embarrassed to say it And so far as the plaintiff 's concerned My Lord, uhm she just simply doesn't know who has heard about this and who may have heard about it, who may have discounted it knowing that she 's a person of unblemished character but who may have certain feelings that there 's no smoke without fire And in my respectful submission My Lord, if the jurisdiction is only three thousand pounds, as it is, then a case of this nature couldn't be heard properly in the County Court Uhm there are other factors in the case which may be a few hundred pounds I accept, but added to that and added to the slander My Lord, in my respectful submission this is a case which clearly should be made in the High Court I face on behalf on the plaintiff My Lord the penalty obviously that if this matter is subsequently adjudicated, that that figure would change within the County Court jurisdiction and of course <unclear> several sylls </unclear> but in my respectful submission My Lord the case taken at a reasonable height should not be remitted It 's for the defendant to establish that the case should be remitted, and that a reasonable jury or a reasonable judge could not find for the defendant, uhm such a figure of three thousand pounds Uh it was a disturbing and unpleasant incident for a lady, a middle-aged lady who is a professional lady in the community and in my respectful submission My Lord, that is a case which should remain in the High Court And it isn't in my respectful submission even a case in which uhm there may be some doubt as the the level of damage I would respectfully submit to you My Lord that the case is clearly within the High Court 's jurisdiction,\n<$B> Yeah I 'm just looking at paragraph four of the defence which alleges that the allegations are true in substance and in fact and then goes on to have an apology I mean is that , I know pleadings in in defamation cases are very odd Can you do that Plead <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> to the fact and an apology at the same time\n<$A> Yes because the defence in terms is that the conversation did take place\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> But the accusation of theft was not made\n<$B> I see yes\n<$A> It was an error, it was a mistake was made\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Rather than saying, you you deliberately drove off without paying\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> What the defendants were saying was, you drove off by mistake and forgot\n<$B> Yes I see Now you were going to say something\n<$A> I was going to say My Lord that if if the, the plaintiff seriously makes the case that her reputation, her previously unblemished reputation has been tarnished and if she has been embarrassed and distressed and upset as she pleads, one would have anticipated an affidavit appearing from her, for the purposes of this application to set out those issues\n<$B> Well I think the average juror would accept that she would have been distressed I would have thought\n<$A> <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$B> Well I think most people, most people would be fairly annoyed I would have thought They mightn't break down in tears but they 'd be fairly angry I would have thought\n<$A> Yes but then My Lord moves on to  to what level that is set at The jury will have the benefit of hearing the evidence of the plaintiff, assessing that Your Lordship is left with the pleadings and not an affidavit which in my submission if there had been any significant issue, an affidavit would have been available before the Master And this same point is raised in front of the master, but still there was no affidavit before Your Lordship\n<$B> Yes well in view of the fact that the limit is three thousand uh pounds I take a view different from the Master I consider that it 's not likely that this would lie within the jurisdiction of the County Court Accordingly I reverse the Order of the learned Master, with costs here and below And while I 'm not hearing the case and having heard the evidence I would have thought it was about five thousand pounds I don't know if that might shorten the matter but, It might well, it might well be worth a great deal more a great deal less depending what way the evidence goes and what witnesses were called but if I was asked on paper to assess it, I would have thought it was about five thousand pounds, Yeah, I 'll send you my bill", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source":

defendant\n<$A> My Lord the plaintiff is a thirty-six year old process worker employed by the defendant in a factory in Lurgan and he uh contracted dermatitis in the course of uh that employment The defendant, Your Lordship is probably aware, manufactures various uh components for use, for medical purposes The, formerly the the <unclear> several sylls </unclear> in Lurgan The plaintiff has worked in various departments in the factory, first under uh as <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and then as Rush manufacturing since the early nineteen eighties He 's been there approximately fifteen years, For approximately five years starting in the early nineteen nineties the plaintiff was working at a particular process which involved the the use of plasticised PVC pastes to make plastic funnels uh which were used for uh in the manufacture of uh stomach or tracheostomy tubes I 'm handing up to Your Lordship uh a set of photographs, <unclear> several sylls </unclear>, If Your Lordship looks at uh photograph number one you 'll see some plastic bags which uh uh contain the finished product You 'll see some   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$C>  Sorry I 'm not finding it easy   to follow exactly what you 're saying Mr McCorry Would you please try to speak up\n<$A> I beg Your Lordship 's pardon The end product is contained in the uh plastic bag\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> Small green plastic funnels\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> You see some of them laid out on the the actual table either side of the guillotine which is used to trim them That would be at the final stage in the process\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> The work also involved the use of methylated spirits uh in order to clean the equipment\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> And during the entire process My Lord the plaintiff 's hands would have been wet\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> Now if I could describe the th' actual process to Your Lordship\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> At the time material to the action, it was carried out in a small room which measured twenty-seven feet by twenty-one feet At various stages uh it was carried out in different rooms Your Lordship but at the time uh when the plaintiff contracted this rash it was uh in this particular room That room is now used as a storeroom You 'll see it in photograph number six If Your Lordship looks at photograph number two you 'll see the room in which the process is presently carried out That 's not the room that the plaintiff would have been working in when he contracted the rash But the equipment and the  uh, used, and the the process that followed would have been the same\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> Now basically Your Lordship the the plaintiff would take a a steel mould which is made up of nail-like pins set into the frame, and if Your Lordship looks at photograph number two you 'll see that to the uh centre left there 's a stool and sitting on the stool there is a a one of the frames containing the pins which actually <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> the mould\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> That is put into a an oven in order to heat it\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> The ovens are those blue uh structures in the in the photograph When the mould is taken out of the, of the oven it 's mounted in a frame which is situated over a tank of plasticised paste, Now if Your Lordship looks at photograph number three you 'll see the uh tank containing, the tank containing containing the plasticised paste and suspended above it is the uh the mould <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> Those pins are immersed in the tank for approximately fifteen seconds, and basically what happens is that the pins become coated in the paste The entire mould is then removed and is placed in one of the ovens for curing That takes about three minutes, After curing it 's removed from the oven and it 's placed in a water tank which is shown in photograph number uh four Now Your Lordship may actually have photograph number four a, there was apparently there was some confusion <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> return the photograph but it basically shows the same thing uh, Your Your Lordship will see in that photograph a large stainless steel tank of water and you 'll see the uhm the frame containing the uh pins sitting above that water Immersed in the water tank, that pool, the uh the mould and the uh and the cured uh funnels, then placed above the uh the tank in the way shown in photograph number four to allow the water to run off And then the final stage in the process as shown in photograph number one the plaintiff takes the the the funnel off the mould and at that table he would use the guillotine to uh to trim them Now at that stage Your Lordship they would still be wet Whilst the plaintiff, is carrying out that trimming, there would be another batch of uh uh uh of funnels in one of the ovens so it 's an ongoing process and the plaintiff 's hands would be wet throughout that process\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> Now in addition to this Your Lordship the plaintiff has to top the tank up with PVC paste uh in the mornings and uh at various stages throughout the day And the first thing that he would do when he starts work in the morning is that he would take the paste out of an open drum He takes it out using the jug shown in photograph number five, just an ordinary plastic jug, pours it from the jug into a a plastic bucket, and again it 's just an ordinary plastic bucket which you 'll see at the bottom right of photograph photograph number two\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> It 's then placed in a vacuum in order to take the air bubbles out of it and then   <unclear> several sylls </unclear> \n<$C>  In a what  \n<$A> Into a vacuum, in order to remove the air bubbles, and then the plaintiff would use the jug to remove paste from the bucket and top up the tank throughout the day Unfortunately he would get the uh plastic, plastic paste onto his hands, And the other substance with which he 'd come into contact is the methylated spirits and you would use that to clean the various uh components, his equipment He 's not doing that so regularly as he did from time to time My Lord, The plaintiff 's working hours were from seven thirty to four thirty on Monday to Thursday with a fifteen minute uh morning break and a forty-five minute uh lunch break On Friday he would work from seven thirty to twelve thirty and in addition to that he would regularly have worked overtime By way of protective clothing he was provided with uh a white coat which was closed at the wrists, and he also wore a hat, disposable type hat Now the plaintiff uh didn't wear the white coat all the time It was generally worn uh when he was carrying out this process in uh uh another room which was known as the clean room At the time when the plaintiff was working <unclear> several sylls </unclear> was working in uh the room in which he contracted the uh the rash he in fact was wearing no  uh coat at all and would have been working in a T-shirt, The plaintiff never wore gloves whilst he was carrying out this process He 'd been taught the process by uh another uh process worker in the factory uh and that man hadn't worn gloves either No-one ever told the plaintiff that he should wear gloves And the case would be that the supervisors would have saw him constantly at work and would have been aware that no gloves were worn At no stage was it suggested to him that he should wear gloves, Good washing and drying facilities were provided in the main factory uh toilets and washrooms uh approximately thirty yards away from uh the room in which the plaintiff worked But there were no drying facilities whatsoever uh in the the room where he actually carried out the process, and given the nature of the job and the fact that it 's a continuous process, it wasn't feasible for the plaintiff to be going back and forward all day uh uh in order to dry his hands The result was that his hands therefore were constantly wet, The defendant furnished the uh safety data sheet relating to the various substances with which the plaintiff had come into contact with, namely the methylated spirits and the, the PVC paste, These show My Lord that the the paste is a a mild skin irritant and it 's recommended that gloves be worn and in fact a particular type of glove is mentioned, uh neoprene, N E O P R E N E gloves The manufacturers recommend that when one 's working with this substance uh neoprene gloves uh should be worn The plaintiff first noticed a a rash on his right hand and that would have been during the first half of nineteen ninety-three He did nothing about it at that stage My Lord because it was of no great significance and it didn't appear to be getting any worse so he basically left it and continued on working In the early part and in the middle part of nineteen ninety-four the rash became much worse It involved both hands and it spread up the forearms to the elbows He 'd been at Craigavon Hospital at that time uh on his general practitioner 's referral It was also noted at that time that he 'd a rash on his scalp, When the plaintiff uh drew the defendant 's attention to the rash he was sent then to uh Dr Adams the uh defendant 's, the factory doctor, and uh he diagnosed a contact dermatitis and directed that the plaintiff be moved to another job and that happened the plaintiff has moved to a clean dry job in the factory, And when he was moved the the rash significantly improved The current situation is that he would experience uh flare-ups which at the present time would be occurring perhaps every six to seven weeks They 'd last a week or so when they come and the plaintiff can treat them himself using uh a <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> uh cream He took just two weeks off work, special damages are agreed at two hundred and fifty pounds, Evidence is to be given  for the plaintiff by Dr Eadie a consultant dermatologist at Craigavon Area Hospital who has diagnosed an an irritant contact dermatitis, caused by the wet work and the constant exposure to the paste the the uh plasticised paste and to methylated spirits, The defendants were put on notice uh My Lord of the intention to apply for leave to amend the uh Statement of Claim, It 's a very minor amendment My Lord and the intention of it was to uh uh add uh methylated spirits to the list of offending substances Now I had directed in fact that uh  paragraph three should read uh uh, at the fifth line should read contact with plasticised PVC paste, methylated spirits and water Now unfortunately it has not methylated spirits hasn't been inserted there I 'd also directed that it be inserted in the Particulars of Negligence and uh if Your Lordship turns up the page you 'll see that it was added at that point So although it wasn't put in at paragraph number three it does appear on the uh Particulars of Negligence and the plaintiff has therefore noted that uh it is alleged that the methylated spirits played a role in the plaintiff, our plaintiff 's condition", "subdomain":

children in the district and there is graffiti on the peace line, the railings have been prised apart in one place at least so as to give access to the area and I am satisfied from the evidence that this was used in a bizarre way as a play area for children in the district The evidence of Mr Bertoni is that on uh the sixteenth of June he was with his uh uncle, uh Mr Frederick McSweeny who was then about twenty-six or twenty-seven They had a ball and they were uh playing football of sorts Uh but his uncle kicked the football towards him whilst he had his back to the uh railings, the ball went over the railings, uh and that he then went uh through a gap in the railings to retrieve the ball, went over to the area of the uh junction box uh doing so at what appears to have been a jogging pace and as he got close to the box, noticed the ball underneath it, stumbled and hit his head uh against the edge of the metal flap and he then sustained a fairly significant injury to the side of his head which has left some permanent scarring The uh plaintiff uh  is is frank in saying that he 's not absolutely clear what it was caused him to stumble, uh he he thought initially that it was uh some rubble and then answers, in answers given to me uh he said he thought that perhaps it could have been a hole in the ground I think it 's clear that he doesn't really know what caused him to stumble I 'm satisfied that this accident uh occurred uh in the way in which the uh plaintiff uh has suggested But no alternative version of events has been uh given by the defendants for the obvious reason that no representative of the Housing Executive was present and no uh independent witnesses appear to be available And so to a considerable degree uh the Housing Executive is uh unable to contradict the evidence of the plaintiff But in any event I 'm satisfied by the evidence of the plaintiff and Mr McSweeny that his general account of what happened is true In those uh circumstances uh he uh is in law a trespasser on this uh piece of ground occupied uh by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive It 's necessary therefore to consider the uh extent of the duty of care owed to a person in that position Uh helpfully the uh duty of care has been defined now by statute and in the Occupiers ' Liability Northern Ireland Order nineteen eighty-seven uh article three uh subarticle three, it is provided as follows,  an occupier of premises owes a duty to another not being his visitor in respect of any such risk as is referred to in paragraph one if, a, he is aware of the danger or has reasonable grounds to believe that it exists, b, he knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that the other is in the vicinity of the danger concerned or that he may come into the vicinity of the danger, in either case whether the other has lawful authority for being in that vicinity or not  And the risk is one against which in all the circumstances of the case he may reasonably be expected to offer the others some protection Uh paragraph one uh refers to the risk of injury I 'm satisfied that the uh Northern Ireland Housing Executive had reasonable grounds to believe that the danger existed The area was maintained by them quite clearly on a regular basis and uh no doubt routine inspections uh occurred because the grass has been kept cut down to uh a reasonable level, again having particular regard to where the area is located Uh and I 'm satisfied that uh any of their servants or agents going on to the land uh in the ordinary way and uh checking it for uh any dangers would have had no difficulty in discerning that the raised metal flap from this box constituted a danger I 'm also satisfied uh that the uh Housing Executive had reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff or uh someone of his age and uh experience of life would come into the vicinity uh that is into this area uh which had become something of a playground and that uh he would therefore be in the vicinity of the danger I 'm also satisfied that the risk uh which was presented by this projecting metal flap was uh one which it was reasonable to expect the Housing Executive to uh prevent uh and to ensure that it didn't uh cause damage to anyone who came on the land, be they trespasser or not The standard of care uh is uh set out uh in article, subarticle four uh of article three and is stated as follows,  where by virtue of this article an occupier of premises owes a duty to another in respect of such as list , and there 's a list is in here,  the duty is to take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances of the case to see that he does not suffer injury on the premises by reason of the danger concerned  Now I 've indicated this was a clearly foreseeable risk and I 'm satisfied that in measuring a standard of care the uh court should keep a balance between the degree of risk and the danger presented by the risk compared with the uh relative cost and convenience of correcting it or removing it I 'm satisfied that the projecting metal flap presented a high risk of injury to anyone uh close by and that the cost of correcting it would have been completely trivial in in comparison Uh this is something which could have been corrected by a phonecall to whoever was responsible for putting it there in the first place or by having some fairly simple and uh routine repair uh effected or having the metal flap removed In those circumstances I 'm satisfied that the plaintiff has established liability against the defendant It is suggested that he was guilty of contributory negligence in that he failed to take reasonable care for his own safety I 'm satisfied that the plaintiff uh stumbled when he was not expecting it, even if he is unclear what caused him to stumble I do not consider that uh a fourteen year old uh jogging uh at a relatively gentle pace across uh a relatively well-maintained green area uh and losing his footing can be said to constitute uh culpable behaviour on his part In those circumstances uh I 'm not satisfied that the defendant has established that there was any contributory negligence I shall therefore uh dismiss the appeal Uhm the plaintiff 's injuries uh are in the form now of permanent scarring I observed him in the witness box I note that although the scar is in the hairline that uh it, it 's obvious from a considerable distance and I can see it from the bench uh where he is sitting some perhaps uh twenty-five thirty feet away In the circumstances I 'm satisfied that the award of the County Court judge was a reasonable award", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "45506f26-ac20-4cec-98ad-623c62ccbd67", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.377605+00:00"}

nineteen ninety-eight when she was sixteen and she 'd had a a baby on the sixth of March nineteen ninety-nine My Lord, just a about month and a half or so before the subject 's accident And what happened to her My Lord was on the afternoon of the sixteenth of April nineteen ninety-nine, she was walking along the Springfield Road in Belfast, when she fell on the pavement She had been My Lord in a cousin 's house in the Beechmount area and she was intending to walk to her grandmother 's on the Grosvenor Road And she fell My Lord on the footpath outside uh number ninety Springfield Road, which is uh called Peter Pan complex My Lord It 's a training centre I hand, should be before Your Lordship hopefully, uh three black and white photographs, from a Mr Ridley, a professional photographer <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> studios, and they show My Lord the uh subject area The first photograph My Lord shows the plaintiff looking at the Peter Pan complex, number ninety And then there is the photograph My Lord with a ruler in it\n<$B> Well they 're in a different order now before me\n<$A> Oh sorry I apologise for that My Lord\n<$B> Yeah P P one is the one with the , with the ruler in it\n<$A> Very well I 'll mark that for you My Lord Then that is showing a close-up of the defect My Lord and I 'll describe how this plaintiff fell in a moment Then there 's a photograph My Lord showing just the general area of footpath, no person in it And then the defect in that photograph I should say My Lord is of course the middle <unclear> several sylls </unclear> And then the photograph with the uh lady in it My Lord that is in fact the uh plaintiff and she 's looking there at number ninety My Lord and the defect is again close to the middle of the footpath halfway between <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> and the wall And the plaintiff My Lord at the material time looking at that photograph with her in it My Lord would have been walking away from the camera There 's then a further photograph My Lord taken by Mr McGee the engineer, uh a coloured photograph and in this photograph My Lord the plaintiff would be walking towards the camera, and the defect is beside what is apparently a potato crisp bag My Lord uh <unclear> several sylls </unclear> in the middle of the photograph, a piece of litter, and the defect is is there My Lord And what happened the plaintiff My Lord is that as she walked along on that afternoon, her uh foot, uh the heel part of her foot My Lord\n<$B> Now which, which foot\n<$A> She 's not entirely sure My Lord whether it was her right foot or left foot\n<$B> Well what,  it 's the heel of her foot\n<$A> The heel of her foot, the heel of her shoe went into that depression My Lord which we say was about seven or eight inches long by five or six inches wide and an inch approximately deep And that 's the defect which is shown My Lord in the black and white photograph Her, her heel went into that and she uh caught and uh fell My Lord She 's not entirely sure of the mechanics of her fall in terms of uh the way in which it happened other than she is adamant that her foot went into this depression My Lord She fell and she fell towards her left side My Lord She put out her left arm to attempt to break her fall and unfortunately she suffered a nasty fracture to her left elbow She was immediately aware My Lord of uh, severe pain in the left arm, and being quite close to the Royal Victoria Hospital My Lord she went immediately to the uh Casualty Department And when she arrived there My Lord she was X-rayed and it was discovered that she had suffered a supracondylar fracture of the left elbow and the uh doctor who examined her at that time wanted to admit her and carry out an immediate operation to the left arm My Lord, but the plaintiff at the time My Lord, uh, was most anxious to get out of hospital and return to her baby and she uh contrary to medical advice, left the hospital She went home My Lord, uh, her baby was due to be christened a few days later And then uh a few days after the fall My Lord she returned to the Royal Victoria Hospital and she arranged to be admitted on the day after the christening And uh she went into hospital then My Lord on the twenty-fifth of April, ten days after her fall, the twenty-fifth of April nineteen ninety-nine, and an operation was carried out to reduce the fracture and insert uh J-wires into the arm My Lord on the twenty-seventh of April the next day I should have said to Your Lordship that between the date of the accident and the operation her arm was put in a plaster My Lord in order to attempt to uhm avoid further damage And uh following the operation My Lord her arm was again put in plaster It was in plaster for approximately three weeks\n<$B> That 's that 's three weeks after the , after the operation,   after the operation \n<$A>  Yes My Lord   After the operation My Lord that 's right Then there was <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> for a period My Lord She underwent various exercises or physiotherapy thereafter She will tell Your Lordship that uh she had severe pain in the early stages My Lord, and this caused her great difficulty in handling her new baby and she required a lot of support from her mother She, unfortunately My Lord, uh because she was taking a lot of painkillers, <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear>, she became addicted to the painkillers uh for a period of time She had suffered from post-natal depression prior to the accident My Lord and\n<$B> Sorry prior to\n<$A> Prior to the accident she had post-natal depression And uh she had recurrences of depression afterwards My Lord, but we 're not making the case that the depression was due to the accident My Lord She was\n<$B> Well are you making any case at all about it\n<$A> No we 're not I 'm I 'm merely mentioning it to Your Lordship\n<$B> As background\n<$A> It may become apparent uh, it 's referred to in the medical reports My Lord that the addiction that she had, uh, we 're not even making the case My Lord that any mental uh upset or difficulty is related to the accident\n<$B> Or, or that any addiction is related to the accident\n<$A> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> My Lord We are saying that as a consequence of the medication she was on, relating to depression and the uh painkillers following the fracture she became addicted but we 're not seeking to make uh a link between addiction and the accident\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> She uh gradually recovered a better range of movement in the elbow My Lord but she still has significant limitation of movement and it is important to her My Lord because she is a left-handed person She, in the earlier stages My Lord had difficulty even doing simple things like writing, uh, and dressing and so on but now the only restrictions My Lord would be in terms of uh brushing hair <unclear> several sylls </unclear> She uh has also My Lord a significant scar, and it is accepted uh in the medical reports My Lord that she will have a permanently sub-standard left elbow I haven't handed it into Your Lordship but there is also I believe in addition to the medical reports <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$B> Yes well if you could give me a copy, Yes thank-you Yes\n<$A> At this stage My Lord she gets uh intermittently a shooting pain from her elbow to her hand uh perhaps two or three times a week lasting approximately half an hour and she also My Lord, if she lies on her arm at night she 'll feel it sore and stiff There is no claim for special damages My Lord, Our case very briefly My Lord is that this defect which I 've indicated throughout in the photograph constituted a hazard to pedestrians and therefore <unclear> several sylls </unclear> There, there will be evidence from Mr McGee as to why he thinks that defect arose but <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n\n\n<$C> My Lord the plaintiff Thomas Gordon, was born on the nineteenth of March nineteen thirty-five Now he 's sixty-six, he 's a retired factory worker, He is also or has been over the years a part-time farmer, keeping some cattle himself, This accident occurred on the twenty-second of August nineteen ninety-nine in a laneway at Crossnarea, C R O S S N A R E A, Moneymore, He will give evidence that the uh defendant, that 's Mr McSorley 's, bullocks had uh broken out of their field and had gone into a field owned by the plaintiff 's nephew, Now the plaintiff was out at his nephew 's field and observed Mr McSorley 's bullocks with uh his nephew 's animals and at that time then Mr McSorley arrived, uh to remove his animals And he came down this uh like a laneway with a uh trailer on the back of his vehicle with the intention of herding the bullocks onto this trailer and then removing them back to his land He asked Mr Gordon to give assistance, and if I provide you with a set of photographs, they perhaps , they show the situation, My Lord the trailer uh as shown in photograph one, uh it opens up so that the door acts as a ramp and then within the trailer there are a couple of uh side gates that come out so that they form side gates along the side of this ramp and the animals are then driven onto the trailer And the area <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> is shown in the succeeding photographs Uh I refer Your Lordship to photograph two and photograph three The uh the closed gate which one sees in photograph two is the direction in which the animals were being driven And the vehicle had been reversed down so that the gates which one sees open to the right of the laneway, it was pushed up against the side of the side gate of the uh uh trailer so that effectively that was meant to block off the animals ' passageway Then, the uh other side of the ramp was obstructed by a, a thick gate at the rear of the uh trailer so that effectively, uh the uh beasts could not come up, come up the lane and escape beyond the trailer\n<$D> And the ramp had been lowered at this stage\n<$C> The ramp had been lowered Now there was a problem in that, uh if we, if we look at photograph three, uh the area between the closed gate, to the right of the closed gate and then to the left of the open gate, uh that is a hedge of sorts owned by the defendant, and there was a hole in that hedge so that uh the plaintiff was asked to stand and block that hole, to prevent the\n<$D>  is that to the right of the open gate, where you see the foliage is a bit thin no\n<$C> No it 's not It 's actually within that but it looks like rather thin foliage in the photograph\n<$D> Well he was gapping in any event\n<$C> He was having to stand there Now the, as I say there was, there were uh four bullocks They uh, were uh suckling bullocks which uh the plaintiff will describe there being some significance in that Uh bullocks can apparently be reared and be hand-fed and if they are they, would usually be rendered more docile Suckled ones which in other words were fed by the cows have a tendency to be uh wilder beasts And as uh Your Lordship may be aware but, uh for completeness ' sake the bullock is really a a a bull which has been castrated at the age of about eight months or so and this particular, these particular animals were about eighteen months old They uh, had broken out let 's say from their own field and gone in with uh the nephew 's animals They were then driven by Mr Gordon towards the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> trailer, but uh three of them uh escaped by jumping over a hedge so that Mr uh McSorley was left driving one bullock towards this trailer And again the evidence would be that uh strange as it may seem that if there if there 's four animals there 's a tendency for them to remain more docile whereas if a beast is isolated it has a tendency to give more trouble Uh so it was being driven uh into this area to the rear of the trailer and the arrangement was that uh Mr Gordon was to stand at this hedge and he had a bit of a stick with him and he was to block this gap The defendant was to drive the beast onto the uh, onto the trailer and was then to immediately follow it on and shut the trailer ramp behind him Uh and unfortunately what happened was, for whatever reason the defendant didn't follow on, didn't shut the ramp so that the beast was driven on and then turned round and came out back into the area where Mr Gordon was standing and it then was agitated, came towards him and he, much as he was striving to try and push it away but it turned round and kicked out at him and kicked him on the left side of his body and he suffered bruising of the body and then <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the hernia which is dealt with in the medical evidence that I 'll come to shortly The uh allegation against the defendant is that the uh defendant was negligent in failing to follow the beast on towards the trailer, shut the door, shut the ramp rather, so as to prevent the animal getting out and that uh the consequences of not doing that were that the animal in escaping was by that stage in an agitated condition and was uh, a dangerous animal as such The second allegation would be that it was far from ideal for the plaintiff to stand in the position in which he was asked to stand He was in an enclosed area, in close proximity to uh an animal which uh had a tendency to behave aggressively particularly in the situation <unclear> several sylls </unclear> and he shouldn't really have been The only reason he was there was he was blocking the gap in Mr McSorley 's hedge\n\nThere has been uh medical evidence such as a report from the GP and a report from Dr Lesley The plaintiff suffered uh bruising on the left side of his body and he became aware, within a very short time after this incident of a uh swelling, which was later diagnosed as uh a hernia and uh the evidence from Dr Lesley uh would in my submission satisfy the court that that hernia is, follows on as a consequence of the accident Uh he the plaintiff has been in pain since since the incident and is presently waiting for an operation on the hernia He was off work for six weeks following the accident and <unclear> several sylls </unclear>", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source":

{"text": "<Rollerblade injury>\n\n\n<$A> Now very briefly, reminding again the court first of all that she 's six years of age or six at the time In relation to your account of how it happened I 'd say to Your Lordship it was a very clear account Uhm, the the key to it in one sense is perhaps that last answer which is something that you gave in evidence <unclear> 5 sylls </unclear> She knows that she went into it totally because her foot was in it afterwards so when her father <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> or her uncle is really it uh is irrelevant at this stage And she 's given a very clear account which is uh believable, no inconsistencies would and in engineering terms absolutely consistent with how such an accident could happen So my position is that there 's no dispute really as to how the accident happened\n<$B> <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> Now these two photographs, when were they taken\n<$A> They were taken by Mr Robson uhm, yes they 're quite recent I 'm sorry I apologise to you\n<$B> Well I mean are they in evidence That 's my only concern Are these in evidence\n<$A> No objection They 're served under <unclear> several sylls </unclear> so they, they 're simply to give you a more general view of the area The importance of them, if there is any importance to them is just the houses close by and the type of the footpath It is the sort of the area where it would be quite reasonable for children uh rollerskating because its nature is quite, the road really is quite uh safe So what I 'd say is that what one has here is a very clear danger on the footpath which would be a danger to pedestrians There 's a clear breach of the duty to maintain And come back to this issue Is someone who is injured in such a defect excluded by reason of the fact that she had rollerblades on rather than using the footpath for simply walking Now in my submission there, there 's no such exclusion involved The issue is whether the footpath is dangerous, and it was dangerous It might be different if if the situation was that her injuries were due not to that danger but to the fact for example Your Lordship gave earlier, the fact that one was simply using the rollerblades, in other words they were propelled in such a way that the injuries were so much more serious due to the fact that <unclear> several sylls </unclear> I 'm not sure what speeds rollerblades do but let 's say you 'd been doing a speed of twenty miles per hour and you 're flying along the footpath at twenty miles per hour and you come to an uncovered <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and you 're propelled ten feet or twenty feet through the air and suffer a very serious head injury, well the the reason for that, the injury, the causation in respect of the injury is the fact that you were using rollerblades But in a case like this where one was using rollerblades as a child at no apparent excessive speed, what really happens is that she simply catches her foot and goes forward and hits her face The sort of accident that would happen, that could easily have happened if she was running along the footpath running back to her house, had been walking along Perhaps walking she may not have gone, gone uh gone down so, sharply One doesn't know But one 's entitled to walk, one 's entitled to run A child of that age, six quite often would be running along, going back home, going back to one of those houses, put her foot in this, foot catches equally uh easily as the rollerblade and she falls forward so the mechanism of the injury is absolutely consistent with the the history of the injury and the fact that she was wearing rollerblades has not increased or contributed to the nature or significance of the injury Uh even if I was wrong in that, my submission would be if one was using rollerblades in a reasonable fashion uh which might increase slightly the the the injuries which one would suffer, that one would not be excluded in these circumstances\n<$B> Yes , may I just reread again this note from Lord Justice McCollum\n<$A> Yes,\n<$B> Well I see I follow that quote by saying this decision of the Court of Appeal is binding in this court and accordingly I have to dismiss the plaintiff 's claim\n<$A> You do I 'm not sure whether one would interpret that with reluctance or otherwise I 'm not sure how I 'd interpret Your Lordship But it\n<$B> My recollection is, off the record it was with some reluctance Yes\n<$A> But what I what I say there is is is, it 's interesting, if one looks just at the previous page I 'm sorry you 're on the uh, the,   the , you 're on the uh report book\n<$B>  Yes  \n<$A> Just a few lines before you quote uh, uh Lord Justice McCollum 's uh portion where where you referred Lord Justice McDonnell at that stage was hearing the case in the first instance He  said to, to Mr Miller, uh I think there is a heavy enough duty imposed on them without requiring them to make pavements up to the standard of cases where skateboards are or can be used And I wouldn't have any, any uh disagreement with that Skateboards obviously require perhaps even a greater level, a greater degree of\n<$B> I mean the two millimetres wouldn't be safe for a skateboard\n<$A> That 's what I think So we 're not saying that you have to make the the footpath be safe for skateboards, what we say is you have to make the footpath safe for pedestrians But if that danger causes injury to use, someone using other <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> then the Department is liable And I don't take from uh, subject to what Your Lordship finds and what it says on the <unclear> 1 syll </unclear>, I don't take from the uh extract from Lord Justice McCollum 's uh notebook uh the uh decision as saying that uh if you 're using a skateboard or if you 're using uh rollerblades or a bicycle that you do not recover It seems to me to focus again on this question of what is the standard of the care, what is the standard that is required what is the duty duty of safety for pedestrian traffic But it doesn't go further in my submission to say then that if the Department breaches that duty that then one is excluded from compensation if one is one is using a pogo stick or one is using a skateboard or uh rollerskates or a bicycle or whatever <unclear> several sylls </unclear> the arguments <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> that Your Lordship gave, the open manhole, and you 've one child walking, one child running let 's say, one child using their rollerblades even simply because she 's walking on them <unclear> several sylls </unclear> it 's a dark evening and both of them end up in uhm an uncovered manhole, are we saying that the running child is entitled to recover and the child because she happens to have rollerblades on her feet, is not entitled to recover In my submission the law couldn't possibly make such an illogical and irrational distinction And, I just want to, I was going to read the the the the portion of the, Lord Justice McCollum, the extract The absolute decision, the nature of the decision is, it is the duty of the Department in relation to the footpath should be safe for pedestrian travel with all the appurtenances that might reasonably be expected to accompany such travel And I don't disagree with that That is the duty There is no duty to make the the footpath safe for all kinds of traffic such as bicycles and <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> traffic activities which may not be involved in the description of traffic And again, it 's hard to see what particular dangers uh might be caused by the cyclist that wouldn't affect pedestrians but again I 'm quite prepared, prepared for this case to agree that the duty, in to see whether the footpath was safe or not, one doesn't look at <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> and bicycles or other appurtenances One looks at the uh, the question of whether it 's safe for pedestrians The emphasis is on pedestrian usage and would include all the ancillary activities such as wheeling prams et-cetera All kinds of pedestrians are taken into account, that is all kinds of pedestrian use that can reasonably be anticipated And of course one might argue then, certainly nowadays if you consider the view that by considering using rollerblades or little toys on the footpath uh are something which should be reasonably anticipated One could think of these type of uh, uh you remember the the  green , horses with green vehicles and children often wanted pulled along by their parents You don't say that uh if a two year old child happened to be in one of those and it goes into a large obstacle or equipment in the roadway, the child is not entitled to compensation\n<$B> Well that might fall into the wheeling pram category\n<$A>  Yes Where does one, well <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> can I ask you about the difference between the wheeling, wheeling, that sort of activity for a child and the uh rollerblades That 's quite right Uhm, so, the uh, one comes back to this what I say is the core issue if one looks at the  footpath is it safe or not safe for pedestrians If it 's unsafe for pedestrians, the fact that the accident occurred and the child was wearing, had uh rollerblades on her feet, the accident wasn't caused by those then she should get compensation, This is, this is a <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> Again, manifestly unsafe were the words I 've been asked to adopt on it but this isn't a really a long distance away from Your Lordship 's example of the uncovered manhole, uh because it is a very clear danger, it 's a significant danger, and if the other girl had tripped on this walking along, if someone tripped walking at the same time then the child, there would be no question whatsoever that she would be entitled to recover Uhm, I have had a look, I looked at the usual standard <unclear> several sylls </unclear> as regards negligence on places on the highways Interestingly enough, it doesn't appear that this issue has been argued as far as I can see in, in years\n<$B> No I 'm sure I uh I searched for that at the time of this other case\n<$A> Although interestingly enough it doesn't, again it doesn't seem to restrict uh, to pedestrians <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> in the textbooks as persons using the footpath For example one of the old examples is the old cellar, uhm openings which collapse under someone Are you saying that if you 're, if you stand on that and it collapses you 're entitled to recover but if you 're standing on it with a pair of rollerblades, you can't recover My submission is that just is illogical and the only logical and proper approach is uh looking to the question, the first question, is it unsafe in respect of pedestrian, normal pedestrian use If it is, then one is entitled to recover unless it 's caused or can be put down to the fact that you had rollerblades on your feet which doesn't, which isn't the situation in this case Uh and uh my submission is that the Court of Appeal decision cannot be interpreted as saying that uh persons uh wearing rollerblades or using skateboards are excluded It doesn't say that and I think that is, <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> all of us would know better than this short statement from Lord Justice McCollum I cannot take from that, and my submission is that the court cannot take from that an exclusion which <unclear> several sylls </unclear> So not to, not to repeat myself but that is the that is the situation from the plaintiff 's point of view or the argument from the plaintiff 's point of view",

{"text": "<Public accounts>\n\n\n<$A> Uhm Chairman, I go to  first, the first issue I I 'd like to to raise  and that is one that I touched on earlier when we were talking about industrial uhm industrial development and uh I 'm not happy we 've I I 've received an answer from from the the Government This year we 're planning to spend three hundred and forty million pounds on Fa/s schemes of one sort or another And that 's an increase of twenty-five percent At the same time we 're planning to cut the spending we put on industrial support strategies of all sorts by eleven percent And the total amount will be a hundred and fifty million In others  we 're spending more than two pounds on training and schemes uh for every one we spend on uh industrial development strategies Now I really do question whether this represents the best use of scarce monies available to us Uh and I think the Government is tending to rush along headlong to to commit itself to this spending not only this year but for the next five or six years And any critics or questioning are dismissed as either ill-informed or even in the case of European officials as cheeky Uh I think if we look back on the last National Development Plan, we cannot give a clear bill of health to the various Fa/s schemes They didn't succeed in containing the growth of unemployment Nor did they even succeed in containing the growth of long-term unemployment within that group The proportion of long-term unemployed grew within the group despite uhm the the the heavy emphasis on Fa/s schemes And these are now to be increased as I say this year by uh twenty-five percent And it 's not just political critics that are expressing misgivings Uhm the recent uhm  Culliton Report which is I suppose now somewhat old But the Culliton Report uh clearly spelled out huge problems in the area of Fa/s and the priorities it was giving Uh one of the big difficulties it it saw was the uh excessive , the lack of emphasis on training within industry Now only today we see that that has not improved, that uh IBEC have produced uh uh uh their proposals highly critical of this this this area of of activity Uh then we had the uh consultants to the NESF who produced uhm a paper showing that the placement rates from many of the uh the Fa/s schemes was extremely poor It was just sixteen percent in the the case of social employment schemes, nineteen percent in the case of  alternant schemes, uh sixteen percent also in the case of uh VTOS These are very very poor results for the people who are taking part And these also prove to be the most expensive schemes within the the the various, the the Fa/s uhm remit Now there has been some modification in SES but only a slight modification in its new, uhm its new CEP uh formation So that you had that group  criticising Then you had most uh recently the ESRI medium-term review which I have here and uh it again was highly critical of of our efforts in this area And they pointed to uhm numerous weaknesses, there are still too many Fa/s programmes, too many unsuccessful Fa/s programmes, uh they went on then to say the huge missing element in in the human resource programme is the focus on targeted , targeted action on initial education to prevent early failure and dropout Uh they were concerned about the the the the new CEP, that it hadn't really uh dealt with the SES, uh the weaknesses in the SES, uh they went on then to be highly critical of the way in which uh evaluation is is being conducted, predominantly where it 's coming essentially from sponsors of of of uh programmes or or doing self, uh self-sponsorship, uh self self-evaluation Every one of these bodies have put up uh warning signals about uhm the the the area of manpower uh policy and I think it 's not good enough that we haven't had a clear statement in the way of uh a White Paper on manpower policy from Government as to what exactly these schemes are intended to do, against what standards should we evaluate them Uh I I think we we 're we 're being less than honest with the public at large and there is now widespread cynicism about a lot of the Fa/s schemes which is is in some cases it 's undeserved but it 's because Government have refused to come clean and deal with these uh cases honestly There are some specific decisions taken in the last year that I 'd have to question The Employment Allowance Scheme, it 's still not clear whether this has been axed or put on a drip but it was a very successful scheme The uhm the report that went to the NESF showed that at the end of one year a hundred percent of the people participating were still uh working, unlike the SES where there was only sixteen percent It was the cheapest of all the schemes, it  gave people the chance to set up enterprises within three months of becoming unemployed This was the sort of scheme that if we were emphasising entrepreneurship and and and uhm  initiative in our community should have stayed and it 's the one that 's been axed Uh the CEP programme that 's come in, it still excludes uhm deserted wives, people on deserted wives ' benefit, it refuses to give a class-A stamp, it 's still very much in the category of scheme and not something that is a foot, giving a foothold to get back into the workplace The NESF uhm work which will be shortly published is clearly showing that what 's needed is not these stopgap  schemes but something that was a clear pathway back into employment and is highly uh questioning the the CEP philosophy Uh I I I again would draw attention to the fact that uh in this year 's estimate we 're cutting back the allocation to training within industry as witnessed by the uh earlier subsections where we dealt with huge cuts in the training elements of the Forbairt budget and the training element of the IDA budget These again are contrary to recommendations that we understood had been accepted by Government, that uh there must be increasing emphasis on on training within industry And it is ironic that the, the special advisor to the Minister is one of the people who was author of the highly critical report And I think there is the skill and experience within the Department to come up with better and to come up with uh a coherent policy in this area rather than uh building piecemeal one scheme upon the other as we 've had in in recent years And I think that will be my my final uh appeal would be that we would see a coherent policy statement from Government on this area\n\n\n<$B> Chairman, just following on from what Deputy Bruton has said, uh I 'd like to also draw attention to the whole uh evaluation of uh the various uh Fa/s schemes and training and education uh generally  as has been stated, we 've had the National Economic and Social Forum uh report which examined this issue uh or should I say we 've had uh newspaper reports uh of their evaluation of uh these various schemes Uh unfortunately the paper itself uh which dealt with this issue is is is not generally available to the public or indeed to Oireachtas members uh because I  I sought it but I understand that once the final report of the NESF is out, uh that this paper then uh could be made available but according to newspaper reports anyway, uh there was uh serious uh concern indeed about the uh benefit of uh some of the training uh which we are undertaking at the moment uh particularly uh through Fa/s Uh and uh I think that was probably uhm the start of of this uh general debate Uh I note also uh Minister that you accepted a report from IBEC yesterday uh dealing with this same issue and maybe you might use this occasion to uh respond to their concerns Uh I gather that uh IBEC believe that uh more training and education should be uh given to people already in employment or certainly that seemed to be a a a summary of what the the newspaper said today uh in relation to to that report Uh I certainly raised uhm uh doubts previously about uh our national plan and the uh amount of uh European funding uh going into this whole general area Uh and I do think now that we do need a uhm a a full-scale debate on the issue Uh there 's no doubt that education and training uh generally   is needed but I do think we need now to examine very carefully uh the whole evaluation process and to see uh exactly what we 're doing  and what our objectives are Uh there is a view that uh there is a view abroad indeed that many of these schemes are simply to take people off the dole queues Now uh I don't go along with that fully but on the other hand uh I think we need to state that uh very uh clearly, that we are serious about training and that we are serious about education Uh having said all that I do believe we have come a long way uh in recent years uh and the quality of the schemes uh have improved Uh I remember a few years ago there was a an office procedure and training course uh organised uhm in a centre close to my own constituency and many of the the young girls involved  in that uhm had bananas to use as telephones They didn't actually have uh telephones to apply themselves and they used bananas  as uh an improvisation So presumably,  presumably we we have moved on uh from that stage uh and uh uh you know many of the the courses are uh much more uh comprehensive indeed but I   as as Deputy Bruton said previously we  need we do need a full-scale uh evaluation, uh we need to uh know where we 're going uh and we need to have a cost-benefit analysis generally uh of this whole, uh this whole area There there 's just one uhm technicality I 'd like to raise Minister and that is if if somebody is not drawing unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, uhm very often they 're not eligible for some of the Fa/s schemes Uhm say for example uhm a person where one of the spouses is working and they 're just not eligible for unemployment assistance, I think that whole area is uh should be looked at uh from the point of view uh of of giving some of these people uh a chance to participate but uhm and there there are other uhm technical aspects of the schemes which need to be looked at and I 'm sure we can put them uh to you uh in due course but uh I would welcome uh the Minister 's response to the general debate which is now beginning in relation to the whole uh area of, uh uh of training and education and the evaluation of the schemes", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "0bd57190-20f1-446a-83fa-5c3b7f90f18b", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.380919+00:00"}
{"text": "<Resignation>\n\n\n<$A> I understand that it is the intention of some members of the committee Mr Chairman to put questions to me about these events I welcome the opportunity  to answer all questions which may, which they may deem fit to ask I was appointed Attorney General in September nineteen ninety-one and I assumed office immediately The role of Attorney General I soon discovered is a very wide-ranging one and involves a very heavy workload on many different fronts Apart from being legal advisor to the government collectively, the Attorney General is the legal advisor to each Minister and each department of state, being required to give advice on a daily basis on all aspects of Irish Law, European Law and International Law He has to take responsibility for the conduct of all legal proceedings in which the State is involved, not only in the courts in Ireland but in the European Court, as well as before the European Commission on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights In addition he has the responsibility for the drafting of legislation, transposing European Law into Irish Law, the preparation of statutory instruments and other legal documents required by the government He also has responsibility in extradition cases, as well as many other responsibilities It has been alleged that I was a part-time Attorney General This is quite incorrect While theoretically I was permitted to carry on practice insofar as it did not impinge on my work as Attorney General, in reality I spent as best I can recollect only eight days in court over a period in excess of three years Three of these days were spent in the Supreme Court, arguing as Attorney General without fee the Cabinet confidentiality case My routine was to be in my office between eight and eight-thirty a-m and to remain there throughout the entire working day On very rare occasions I attended at the Four Courts for legal consultations These consultations were arranged during lunch hour and never in any way impinged on my responsibilities as Attorney General I was available twenty-four hours every day to the Taoiseach, members of the Government and to my office The following, Sir, is an my account of the facts into which you have been required to investigate by resolution of Da/il E/ireann, dated December the sixth nineteen ninety-four, I should say that due to changes which have taken place in the different governmental offices since this inquiry was ordered by the Da/il, I will refer throughout to the various persons whom I mention by their surname rather than the title of the office which they held or presently hold And  by this I I mean no disrespect to any office-holders, past or present One, in the early months of this year, while on my own with Mr Reynolds in the Cabinet dining room, a general discussion arose concerning the pending retirement of Chief Justice Mr Justice Finlay Two, we discussed in quite a general way the question of persons who might be available and suitable to succeed the Chief Justice on his retirement in September In the course of that discussion I indicated for the first time to Mr Reynolds that in consequence of the appointment of the , if in consequence of the appointment of a new Chief Justice, the  of the High Court became vacant, I would be interested in being considered for appointment as President of the High Court Mr Reynolds told me that he would favour and support my appointment to that position if the vacancy arose In May of this year, Mr Reynolds suggested to me that I should inform Mr Spring of my interest in being appointed President of the High Court if that office became vacant Sometime later, I believe in early June, I arranged to meet Mr Spring after a Government meeting and I informed him of my general interest in being appointed as President of the High Court if a vacancy arose in that office He listened to me and said that he noted what I was saying Not once since that date has Mr Spring ever spoken to me about the matter, either to express reservations or otherwise about my aspiration He listened to me and said he noted what I was saying Thereafter Mr Spring never spoke to me again about the matter Over the summer there was media speculation as to who might be the new Chief Justice and who in the event of Mr Justice Hamilton being appointed Chief Justice would become President of the High Court My name was widely mentioned in that speculation Subsequently, I became aware of newspaper reports that Mr Spring had, quote reservations unquote, about my possible appointment as President of the High Court These quote reservations unquote were never stated or enumerated to me, nor to my knowledge were they ever detailed to anybody Nor indeed was the basis for these reservations ever made clear Other members of the Labour Party began to speak about the existence of reservations but they never specified what these reservations were, or what the basis of these reservations was In September Mr Spring publicly expressed the view that he favoured the appointment of Ms Justice Denham to be President of the High Court She, through Chief Justice Hamilton, promptly indicated that she would not be available and had not been consulted by Mr Spring prior to this announcement by him I was assured by Mr Reynolds throughout this period that the majority of the Government strongly favoured my appointment as President of the High Court, particularly after the appointment of Mr Justice Hamilton to the office of Chief Justice And I was assured that the appointment would be made if I still wished to be considered I indicated on the basis of this information that I was still interested in that appointment if the Government thought it appropriate, I was aware that there was a considerable amount of political discussion, some of it in Tinnakilly House and some of it between Fianna Fa/il Ministers, two Fianna Fa/il Ministers and two Labour Ministers, concerning the appointment of a President of the High Court And thereafter, I was assured, both by Mr Dempsey and Mr Cowan, the two Fianna Fa/il Ministers involved in the discussions, that such quote reservations unquote as had existed among Labour Party Ministers had been resolved and that the Government would, after I had prepared the text of the new Courts Bill be nominated without dissent for appointment to the Presidency of the High Court I was not at the meeting in Tillakilly House, I should add The Courts Bill was duly drafted in my office on the basis of the heads of the Bill prepared by the Department of Justice The text of the Bill was approved by the Government on October the eighteenth and published and introduced in the Da/il on November the second In October, reports of the Father Brendan Smyth case appeared in newspapers, bringing to the attention of the public and to my attention, the fact that Father Smyth was serving a prison sentence for certain offences in Northern Ireland The reports also alleged that a request for his extradition had not been acted upon by the Office of the Attorney General here over a seven-month period, and that he had returned voluntarily to Northern Ireland I immediately arranged to be furnished with a report by the senior legal assistant in my office in relation to the Father Smyth case The senior legal assistant is the equivalent to the Secretary of a government department The report of this official clearly stated inter-alia that the file had never been brought to my attention, a fact repeated in a later report to me and in his report to Mr Fitzsimons, uh a copy of which I think members of the Committee have already circulated to them and certainly a copy of which was furnished to me by the secretariat of the Committee I furnished a copy of this report to the Minister for Justice Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn and to Mr Reynolds on October the twenty-fifth and subsequently I furnished a detailed report to Mr Reynolds, based on his second and fuller report made to me by the senior legal assistant in the Office of the Attorney General, relating to the handling of the Smyth case by him This second report is dated November the ninth nineteen ninety-four On the eleventh of November nineteen ninety-four the Taoiseach Mr Reynolds presented my written report to the Government at a Government meeting And I attended that meeting and answered questions relating to the report I then left the meeting as the next item on the agenda was the appointment of a new President of the High Court I adjourned to my office and remained there And after some time I was informed by the Secretary to the Government that the Government had made a decision to recommend me for appointment as President of the High Court by the President of Ireland Later that evening, I was formally appointed President of the High Court by the President of Ireland at A/ras an Uachtara/in On the fourteenth of November, Mr Fitzsimons came to my home and conveyed to me the suggestion that I consider my position and-or postpone the taking of the oath of office My recollection of that conversation conforms substantially with the account given by Mr Fitzsimons, describing both the meeting on the fourteenth of November nineteen ninety-four and the meeting on the fifteenth of November However, from reports of these meetings attributed to Mr Fitzsimons and the account given to the Committee today which I watched on a monitor in an adjoining room, there are some points of emphasis which have not been fully appreciated and I will refer to them shortly where they are relevant in the context of this statement, I did not consider it inappropriate that the Attorney General should be used to convey a message from the Taoiseach to a judge of the High Court in the exceptionally rare circumstances where such a communication might be appropriate or necessary However, I did consider it inappropriate and constitutionally incorrect and improper that members of the Government or the legislature should seek to bring pressure to bear on a judge to resign from office in order to resolve a particular political problem It was in this context that I pointed out to Mr Fitzsimons that I had been nominated by the Government to be President of the High Court and had been duly appointed by the President of Ireland to that office Accordingly, I did not accept either invitation conveyed to me by Mr Fitzsimons on behalf of the Taoiseach and Fianna Fa/il Ministers on Monday the fourteenth or Tuesday the fifteenth of November On the , on November the fifteenth and November the sixteenth last, Mr Reynolds spoke in Da/il E/ireann On the first occasion he strongly defended in a most comprehensive way my conduct as Attorney General and the decision of the government to recommend me for appointment to the presidency of the High Court On the following day, November the sixteenth, with no apparent change in circumstances,  or in the factual basis which existed for the speech which he delivered on November the fifteenth, Mr Reynolds made a further speech in Da/il E/ireann where he introduced for the first time the existence of the Duggan case and used the fact that it had not been brought to his attention by me, by my office or by me, as a reason to contend that if he had been aware of the Duggan case he would not have gone ahead with my appointment as President of the High Court and indeed, would have sought my resignation as Attorney General When the members of the Committee consider the full contents of this statement by me and the statement of other  , witnesses which I understand will be given to the Committee, I believe you will be compelled to find, and I require you to so find, that there was no factual basis to justify the change in Mr Reynolds ' assessment of my conduct or suitability for office, between the making of his speech on the fifteenth of November nineteen ninety-four and the sixteenth of November nineteen ninety-four He was aware of the Duggan case on the Monday and Mr Fitzsimons at his request called to my home to ask me to consider my position or postpone my swearing in as President of the High Court in the light of the  of the Duggan case When I realised that Mr Reynolds and other members of the government were seeking to involve me in a continuing political difficulty, notwithstanding my appointment to the judiciary, I decided to resign so that the judiciary would not be further  embroiled in political controversy In so doing, I was fully conscious that the public perception would be that I had resigned because I had done something wrong or improper  nonetheless, I felt honour-bound to subordinate my personal interest to the interest of the judiciary In that regard, I would like to read, for the benefit of members of the Committee the statement which I made on my resignation on the seventeenth of November nineteen ninety-four, which I append to this statement as an appendix", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "80dc8a97-1567-47a1-9af6-5b3977a7a18f", "added":

{"text": "<Employment>\n\n\n<$A> Thank-you Chairman And indeed we have had uhm a very interesting,  very interesting contributions from all who have spoken here, the five Deputies, Deputy Bruton, Deputy Haughey, Deputy Quill, Deputy Power and Deputy Burke, showing the uh extent of interest into this whole arena Now Deputy Bruton just to to say one thing began and quite rightly some time ago uh when we were dealing with the Apprenticeship Bill in the Da/il and he put to me that there was a need for a White Paper on the whole area of training or the manpower policy and White Paper on training And certainly I feel uh I felt then and I have done some further work on reflection on it that that point is well put and I hope that we 'll be able to come that uh decision quite soon I want to now go into the various points which were raised Deputy Bruton raised the issue of both training for people in employment first of all and then the type of training we were undergoing on the uh various other uh Fa/s uh programmes I wouldn't like it to be, do we spend money on training for the  employed at the expense of the unemployed And I don't think that was what you meant either I don't think it should be an either or situation for I think we should be very clear that there should be specific needs met for training for employment and the same uh for training for unemployed and they are different kinds of training involved To deal with the employed, yes, and to answer to other Deputies ' queries and Deputy Burke and Quill and and Bruton, the point was put to me, uh the document I spent all afternoon with IBEC yesterday, at an open forum they held and they presented me with a document at the end which inter-alia uh looked for the setting up of a specific body under IBEC, another organisation which would uh direct and have the policies for training for , people in employment Uh I was at idem on them on many points but not on that I was at one with them on the point of we are not spending enough on training for employment and yes it does as you said Deputy Quill and Bruton, it does consolidate existing jobs So in its own way it 's contributing to  to employment, as well as uh look to the future in innovation and research and management and all the rest of it So uh also we don't spend either  for on private or public uh enough uh in comparison with other European countries The uhm Fa/s have set up a special industry division We haven't been completely satisfied with that in the Department and we have a small study going within a group of our own plus employers, major employers and and smaller employers They 're coming up with a uhm uh ideas to us, and we 're putting that to the Minister for Finance for the ongoing estimates situation in the end of July and on into the beginning of September And that will seek to identify both public and private monies for  training for employed people So, and to have it worked then into the budget So just to make the point that we are already working on that, and yes it does need to be done Uh I think that, just as importantly is the content of training for that type of training, you can talk about training endlessly but it cannot be a passive activity Clearly it has to be uh a <.> ne <.> in which there is an interaction To deal with another matter which has been risen which is uh education and training and the , the importance of certification, I do agree and we are very  strenuously and robustly seeking to reach an accommodation with our sister department in the Department of Education on the matter and there are difficulties in it Uh there are difficulties of uh what I call patch politics as to whose terrain you are now stepping on or getting off But uh be that as it may we are, hope that we can reach uh an agreement with the Department of Education and ourselves to meet the needs of training for those who are in industry Just before I go on to the main issue which was the whole Fa/s and the Community Employment and various schemes, could I  just address Deputy Power 's point uhm about the Army Apprentice School and some time ago you gave me indeed very valued information about that and about the work that uh you knew was going on in that uh Army Apprentice School We 've moved on that and I 've had a series of meetings myself directly and the officials with all of the state agencies that was the ESB and Bord na Mo/na and the General Council of County Councils, I 'm meeting the Army people I think within the next two weeks, seeking that each of them will use the infrastructure which they have to increase the number of apprentices in a formal sense They 've all run them down uh in numbers I mean, not run down obviously the very uh good apprenticeships they give But they 've run them down number-wise and I 'm seeking to see, maybe a transfer of funding, maybe some other arrangement But  we should use the tradition and the infrastructure which they have available for apprenticeships, to use that before we go off helter-skelter after too many other uh schemes So I have taken your point on board, we spoke of some time ago, and I 'll keep the Committee alerted as to developments in it And we hope that by September we 'll have reached a composite agreement with the various, including the General Council of County Councils Now the general debate here today Chairman, 'twas was very useful, was on whither goes Fa/s and what is it doing And what are the value and uh has it done efforts to rationalise itself And uh to Deputy Bruton I would say that we are addressing the issue of rationalising programmes That is why we brought SES and CEDP and Teamwork together in the one programme called Community Employment Now it does not, it 's not an overnight panacea uh to give everybody long-term unemployed uh a guarantee that at the end of their time on Community Employment they will have progressed to a job But can I just go through the positive points of it, A, there 's much more training in it than there was in any of the other previous schemes and I myself with responsibility for training am making , devising the formula of the curriculum and the modules for the training in it, in conjunction with Fa/s B, a long-term concern was that uh  uh SES and Teamwork and CDP were just for a year Up to fifty percent of the people who will be on Community Employment will be able to be kept on for two and three years if they 're key, key employees and if they need more training, uh where the Community Employment allows of that There is far more female involvement At the last count there was up to forty percent of between the old CDP and what is now the Community Employment there was up to forty percent of female employment on Community Employment But there needs to be, I take your point, there uh lone parents are allowed if they 're in receipt of the allowance, the uh Lone Parent Allowance and others But there needs to be much more broadening of it Those who are not on the register for instance, signing on for credits, women are not allowed uh on to the Community Employment And there 's a clear , uh uh uh issue of discrimination there I think we also would need to face up to the fact that that obviously there 's a clear political issue as well And uh members of the Committee will know to what I refer So it 's a matter of uh openly addressing an issue such as that Uh the, the level of training on them is going to increase I 'm very uh emphatic that it has, the content of that training has to be proper and it has to be based on proper standards and it has to lead to certification But there 's a much more important element in it and I, I 'm determined that we 're going to get it It, the OECD report and other reports from uhm NESC and from the new forum have said that there needs to be this hand-holding exercise, particularly OECD referred to it very strongly They said we have to be interventionist in the active labour market In other words, to take up Deputy Burke 's point and Bruton and and Quill and all of you, there 's no point in putting somebody on a programme and saying, there you are, now you 've got something for twelve months or a year and a half or even two years And then shunting them out when the programme is over That way spells increasing cynicism with the type of programme What we have to have on it and what we have started to do with the new community employment is that there is quite intense uh vocational guidance, there is quite intense uhm counselling, eventually leading to job placement within local areas through the local area partnerships which have been identified Those of you who come from areas which are local area partnerships and there 'll be more of them know that the mix of industry, the mix of unions, the mix of workers on it, allows of doors to be opened to long-term unemployed which were not previously being done I know there particular successes in some of the north Dublin area partnerships and I know in some of the Cork ones as well because the presence on them of quite formidable industrialists whether present or of past uh enables as I said doors to be opened for the long-term unemployed which would never have come right for them It 's easy to say, you say to employers, take on long-term unemployed, there is a, is a resistance there shouldn't be I think there 's a moral imperative on all of us to do what we can for long-term unemployed and that means employers as well Be that as it may there 's the resistance to it, where the area partnership involvement by industrialists has allowed as I said the door to be opened in that respect I freely accept Chairman, that we 're only at the beginning I Maureen Quill used something and I did feel uh a slight fellow, sister  feeling with it which was, were we stumbling into changes, good changes with regards to to necessary changes with regard to what uh we 're at with Community Employment and various others We are feeling our way but I, we 're very clear in the way we want to get to it We want to see people going into employment at the end of it as much as possible We want to see proper training We want to see longer duration We want to see local uh vocational guidance counselling and active job placement in the local community And we want to see that in a direct targeted proactive way We are working our way through that agenda It 's a massive agenda and it is a huge amount of money being spent on it And this committee and us and everyone on it has a right to see that it 's spent correctly and I hope that we would have an opportunity to talk about it in a slightly perhaps less uh uh frenetic environment or a less rushed uh timescale And to go back to Deputy Bruton, I am giving active consideration to a White Paper on training I think if we could do that and set out where each of our ideas is  are going and what would be the outcome as well as the input into it, we would have come uh quite a bit of the way It 's been a brief encapsulation of what has been put forward And just to take up a point yes that Deputy Burke said which was social welfare, uh I agree with you Uhm there 's a need to look at social welfare and the huge billions which go into that as an active <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> of money rather than a passive sense Uh and I feel we 'll have to go along that route as well", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "1b13d639-3e13-4e0b-9fac-5e8dd89588fd", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.383159+00:00"}
{"text": "<Training>\n\n\n<$A> Uh thank-you Chairman I 'd also like to uh sort of endorse what has been said in relation to uh how we spend, no not uh about the bananas, uh there might be a new uh definition for a banana republic Chairman but however, uh you know we have a sizeable budget here for education and training I think if we were to to sit down and plan how we spend that budget carefully and properly we could get better results that we 're getting at the moment Chairman And that must be our great challenge for the year ahead But I do think it is a fundamental mistake that such a small proportion of the budget is spent directly in training people already in uh in jobs, that so little goes directly to industry and the services I think it ought to be a key principle that what we have we hold and where where people are in jobs we should , we should at least try to consolidate and retain the number of people that we have in employment already And to assist in doing that we should be directing more money towards training people who are , who already are in employment in according with the recommendations that were made by IBEC yesterday, in their report to the Minister yesterday I would hope Minister that that report will not be ignored, and that some action will be taken on the recommendations of that report, and that they will be taken very very quickly Uh uh I think it 's important that workers who began their working life uhm, perhaps a long time ago, uh  uh will have to be assisted to keep pace with technology Will have to have the kind of in-house in-service training that will enable them to have the to to to increase their level of skills and will give them the kind of versatility of skill and outlook, to enable them to take on new tasks within perhaps the same industry And that can only be made to  happen if there 's proper provision for in-house training within existing industry And the amount of budget we are  spending already on that is far too little and far too small And I really am looking forward to a response from the Minister uh uh on that issue Uh it was raised uh by IBEC yesterday I think in a very sensible fashion and I hope it will, as I said, I hope it will not be ignored because it is Whilst we must always be seeking and striving to create new jobs, to try to lower the level of those who are unemployed, hand-in-hand with that we must put the same degree of energy and planning and investment into retaining  existing jobs The second point I want to make is in relation to these uh new CEDP schemes Uh I think whilst they have improved marginally from the old SES schemes, the improvement is very marginal indeed And there 's enormous scope for further improvement I think the training element is far far too small and the evaluation and the monitoring is something that hasn't been clearly uh worked out or if it has been worked out it hasn't been worked out in a way that 's convincing enough to to convince me that at the end of the day   this huge investment of money is going to uh going to lead to uh a larger proportion  of of of the long-term unemployed getting jobs as result of these training schemes I remain to be convinced of that Minister I I I think they  they were rather rushed I think the the the core idea was good but it hasn't been worked out at all in any detail, in any practical detail And I think there 's scope for a great deal of work to be done there Because if that isn't done a good deal of the work , of the money spent will be money that will yield no great return at the end of the day in terms  of jobs gained, and new jobs gained and that sort of thing And and I  I want to make a point that I 've made on many occasions before It 's in relation to women, women who have not been signing on And they are excluded They 're currently excluded from these new CEDP schemes And   in that respect they 're very severely penalised And  ironically, what 's beginning to happen now is that a good deal of work, of the kind of caring work that was previously carried out by women on a voluntary basis, is now beginning to be undertaken by men under these schemes And they 're being paid for it So women are suffering twice over Women are being displaced now from work that they did on a voluntary basis because of the operation of these schemes   I think that 's a a a severe setback and that is an unintended result It is a matter of course for the Minister for Social Welfare and not a  matter for any of the Ministers here present But nonetheless I would take it  uh Chairman that there must be co-ordination between the different Departments to make sure that at least we get a better result and a better return from the application of these schemes But that 's one of the areas that I would like the Minister to you know to take a lead in getting a solution for Because if women who haven't been signing on, if they were made eligible for these schemes it would make a great difference to women themselves, to their their outlook on life, to their self-esteem and it would make a great difference to the family budgets that are enormously small in the areas particularly where there are large numbers of children in families It  really would make a difference at that level as well as at the level of creating employment But uh overall I think we 're we 're going into this whole thing in a very, we 're stumbling into this kind of thing without any proper plan Nor will there be a proper plan I think until we come up with uh uh the White Paper  on manpower  and training that Richard Bruton, Deputy Bruton here beside me is constantly calling for I think only when that is done and only when we sit down and push our thoughts in in a in in a coherent frame can we then proceed along the lines that will yield the kind of returns that we 're entitled to expect from what is really a very big investment in education and training and hasn't been yielding the kind of result that it ought to uh in in in, in the recent past or the not so recent past Thank-you Chairman\n<$B> Thank-you Deputy The next speaker is Deputy Sean Power and then Deputy Ray Burke\n<$C> Just to ask the Minister one question, in relation to the training Uh we have in place for a long number of years now the Army Apprentice Training School and I think, there 's no doubting the end product that we  we have there each each year and that have won uh many international awards uh  each year So I think uh they have, we have great expertise available to us in the Department of Defence and I think it 's not being utilised properly I think it would present uh it presents uh tremendous opportunity uh and I think that we should, if we used the expertise there uh that 's available in in in training of the young people, I think there 's tremendous scope there and it 's uh it 's unfortunate I think that we 're not using it to the its its its full potential And I I just ask the Minister if she would give some consideration uh to greater liaison if you like between her Department and the Department of of Defence I think it 's a tremendous opportunity and one that we shouldn't miss\n<$B> The next speaker is Deputy Ray Burke\n<$D> Thank-you very much Chairman Uhm, we don't have the deputy from West Cork available to us today unfortunately  In relation to this particular issue uhm Chairman, probably in the public administration area, the, my dealings with the public, I I find the greatest level of cynicism in relation to this whole area of Fa/s and training and public funds and EC funds that are pumped into the area under the global heading of training The questions are asked, what is achieved Are we training for people, half training them without proper certification for jobs that aren't there at the end of the day Is it money that 's merely put in to keep people uh off the unemployment register Is it there for uh just these grandiose bodies that have  appeared out of, over the last number of years I see for example under the, the various subheads that the European Social Fund pumps in eighty-seven point eight nine seven million pounds in the nineteen ninety-four estimate into this whole area of training We see IBEC talking about training for people in jobs I accept that Why should the taxpayer though have to pay for this training for people in jobs Surely the greatest thing that we should have to do, that we have as a a society is to get down our tax rates, to really encourage incentive and to encourage uhm uh uh job creation in this country And that, uhm  job creation will be, we will create jobs, quicker with low tax rates rather than with subsidies and with uhm training grants et-cetera But we 're pushing in uhm huge money into uhm existing training We also have social welfare And there is a major linkage between social welfare and Fa/s Because in the minds of those that, who through no fault of their own find themselves unemployed, there is this situation of do we stay on social welfare Do we move on to an SES scheme What benefits are we going to lose if we move from one to the other Unfortunately I have to say that having looked at it over a number of years that as it 's presently structured, there is no real direction There is a a shotgun approach taken to it with scattered  shells all over the area Pellets flying everywhere Rather than what should be taken as a rifle to tackle each individual problem It is a, to me at this stage, a waste of our taxpayers ' money and a waste of the EC money which could be better directed in other , in other areas That is not to say that there is much good work being done and there is a lot of good work being done But I 'm afraid that on balance that the uhm real benefits that should be available are not available I have a feeling that a lot of this money is really to a terrible extent a sort of a hush money to keep people relatively quiet while they 're on  uhm part-time schemes uhm rather than creating long-term gainful meaningful employment It is with regret that I say it but that is the purpose of these committees, that we have the benefit to discuss it I put it out as is uh as a view to the Minister and I would be keen to hear the Minister 's uhm considered response to what is a general type of uh accusation", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "f8534fde-5f97-4358-bb98-21c4cdc2ad93", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.384121+00:00"}
{"text": "<Banking>\n\n\n<$A> ACC Bank is anxious to assist the Subcommittee in the discharge of its important duties and therefore welcomes the opportunity to to appear of appearing before the Subcommittee today At all times it was the firm policy of the bank to ensure complete compliance with the DIRT legislation At no time did the bank encourage condone or acquiesce in the evasion of DIRT by its customers However as the Subcommittee is aware certain deficiencies in the operation and administration  of the DIRT provisions were identified by the Controller and Auditor General and referred to in his report The bank does not dispute that in some instances individual staff members failed to put into practice the policy of the bank, It also acknowledges, that with hindsight, it appears that greater effort should  been made by the bank to ensure the implementation at operational level of its policy of compliance The bank accepts that arising from these administrative deficiencies a liability to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of DIRT arose The bank has made a substantial payment, amounting to circa one point three four million in respect of this liability The bank is currently seeking to quantify other aspects of its potential liability Currently in common with other financial institutions the bank is the subject of an audit by the Revenue Commissioners Since its foundation the bank has had a presence in areas of high rural emigration Many of those who emigrated, decided to retain in some cases to open accounts at the bank, which were quite properly classified as non-resident This explains why certain of the bank 's branches had historically held a large number of non-resident accounts in the nineteen eighties The bank for competitive reasons sought to further develop its non-resident  deposit base The very close relationship between the bank and the agricultural community has a relevance in two distinct ways In the nineteen eighties the agricultural sector was in difficulty This had an immediate and serious effect on the servicing of loans many of which became non-performing In nineteen eighty-seven the bank made a loss of fifteen million, uh fifteen million pounds and its survival was in question But for but for support from the Exchequer the bank would have become insolvent As a result of the bank 's  as a result the bank 's statutory remit was altered in nineteen ninety uh in nineteen eighty-eight and again in nineteen ninety-two which enabled the bank to return to profitability The parlous financial state of the bank at this time was the principal focus of managerial attention and returning the bank to profitability absorbed the bulk of managements ' time and resources The bank did its best to meet the significant demands placed on its manpower and resources by the introduction of DIRT in nineteen eighty-six While it failed to achieve full compliance it is important to emphasise that  at no time did the bank encourage condone or acquiesce in on non-compliance From time to time deficiencies in the bank 's administration of DIRT were identified, either by the bank 's internal audit department or by its external auditors All such reports were taken seriously by management An indication of this seriousness was the appointment of a second Deputy Chief Executive in nineteen ninety whose sole responsibility was compliance and control Over the years the bank has continued to make serious efforts to improve its compliance machinery and procedures In nineteen ninety-two the government decided to commence a process which would lead to the bank moving out of State ownership A review of non-resident accounts was one element of the complete review of the bank undertaken by Ernst and Young The statement by Ernst and Young on the first draft of their long form report that the bank could have a potential DIRT liability of up to seventeen point five million pounds has never reflected the true position The figure was never intended to be treated as an actual measure of the bank 's likely liability and this is confirmed by the bank 's  the fact that ACC 's statutory accounts were subsequently approved by Ernst and Young without any provision for such a liability However as a result of the Ernst and Young review the bank took immediate steps to identify all non-resident accounts where there were any deficiencies in the declarations on file As a result of this exercise a number of accounts were reclassified as resident accounts At the time this exercise was being undertaken the Revenue Commissioners made contact with the bank 's external auditors and a meeting took place on the eighteenth of February nineteen ninety-three By reason of what transpired at that meeting the bank undertook understood that the Revenue Commissioners would not seek to exact arrears of DIRT in respect of irregular non-resident accounts for a period prior to the end of nineteen ninety-two provided they were regularised at that stage That is still the position of the bank During the period nineteen ninety-two to nineteen ninety-seven isolated difficulties in relation to DIRT were brought to the attention of management by internal audit and-or the external auditors Where the bank took the view that a liability to DIRT arose on its part, an appropriate amount has been included in the payment made to the Revenue Commissioners apart from three instances where this was not done due to an oversight The bank is very concerned by the serious shortcomings which existed in relation to its operation of DIRT as identified in the report of the Controller and Auditor General However the bank is determined to achieve the highest standards of compliance both now and in the future\n\n\n<$B> On seventeenth December nineteen ninety or nineteen eighty-seven I was appointed a Director and Chairman of ACC by the Government and remained there until April nineteen ninety-six As you 've heard from Mr Darling the Agricultural Credit Company as it was then Corporation as it was then titled was in very poor financial shape and generally low morale at that time They 've lots of problems Were it not for the Government guarantees it would 've been technically insolvent in December nineteen eighty-seven, In such a situation the Government, as shareholders would 've been liable under, guarantees up for up to six hundred million and all the financial repercussions that would 've brought at the time My role as Chairman was to chair the various meetings of the Board and where necessary advise them on strategy in relation to ACC 's, affairs I was also responsible as a  representative  of the board, for dealing with external bodies particularly the Government of the day, the Department of Finance and where necessary any other representative bodies which needed input from the Board of ACC The Department of Finance always had a senior representative from the Department on the Board at all times The Board of ACC  was responsible for the overall policy and direction of the bank As part of its own responsibilities the Board, always in my, experience felt a strong obligation to abide by government laws regulations and guidelines During my period as Chairman I 'm quite satisfied that no member of the Board, was prepared to tolerate any non-compliance with DIRT or any other regulations The Board was at all times conscious that the ownership of the, bank was held by the government on behalf of the Irish people Consequently over the years, I believe that compliance had a very priority with the Board and because of that it also had a high priority with management who were seen to make strenuous efforts in order to ensure compliance with current legislation in general and DIRT legislation in particular In eighty-seven ACC was in the unique position as a State-owned credit institution, that it could only lend for agricultural purposes but in theory it could accept deposits from any persons or entity regardless of its trade and profession, However it wasn't seen as a priority deposit-taking institution by urban dwellers and most of its depositors were in fact rurally based As the ACC could not lend outside agriculture it was placed at a trading  disadvantage as effectively eighty percent of the population did not wish to deposit with it  it couldn't lend to them At the time were it not for the government guarantees the ACC would have failed In nineteen eighty-eight a new Chief Executive was appointed and under the supervision of the Board of Directors new procedures and controls were devised and implemented in order to restore ACC to profitability The most serious of the initial problems was collecting a large portfolio of advances and loans to customers where the customers themselves were experienced the worst cost price  squeeze difficulties for many years due to the agricultural crisis, and rock-bottom agricultural land prices at that time These difficulties were further compounded by the imposition of quotas particularly in the dairy industry In the years following eighty-eight the Board and the new management team  strove to change the direction outlook and prospects of ACC from a purely agricultural organisation, to one which could be attractive as a financial institution in its own right At that time it was not a bank and reported to the Department of Finance rather than the Central Bank Permission was obtained from the Government to broaden its lending base from agriculture to general industry and commerce over a period of time until in the early nineteen nineties, its lending powers were only restricted by its ability to meet prudent solvency margins It progressed thereafter by introduction of normal banking facilities such as current accounts home loans and Visa facilities Its success I think can be measured in its financial results and in the fact that staffing increased, over the years from approximately four fifty in eighty-seven to an average of six forty-eight in nineteen  ninety-eight Through the combined efforts of the Board management and staff, the ACC was restored to the profitable entity it is today During that time it paid over thirty million in corporation taxes, and in excess of seventeen million in dividends to the government, as well as sixty million in DIRT taxes On its privatisation next year it will help to raise hopefully hundreds of millions of pounds for the State This is the corporation which was effectively insolvent in nineteen eighty-seven The Board and senior management of ACC were at all times dedicated to ensuring compliance with the regulations covering DIRT and SACs In this regard, the Internal Audit Department was reconstituted in nineteen eighty-eight shortly after my appointment and became an increasingly important part of the bank over the years, with a brief to ensure compliance with internal regulation and external legislation During my period as Chairman meetings of the Board of the audit subcommittee of the Board were  held on at least a quarterly basis to consider reports from Internal Audit Department At those meetings the concerns and recommendations of the Internal Audit Department, were fully addressed Senior management was then instructed to ensure compliance where deficiencies had been identified This process and the monitoring of follow up, by management and internal audit ensure that the culture of  adherence to regulatory matters prevailed A senior member of management who was the Deputy Chief Executive, was the person to whom Internal Audit reported on a day-to-day basis and he also had responsibility for compliance with banking rules and generally for liaison with regulatory authorities The Department, the regulatory authorities being the Department of Finance and eventually the Central Bank In the area of compliance ACC for at least two years prior to coming under the regulatory wing of the Central Bank, even made voluntary returns on its own initiative to the Central Bank in order to ensure compliance with restrictive banking rules even at a time when we weren't obliged to do so However, we wouldn't be here today, if it weren't for the fact that at times the best efforts of the Board and management to ensure compliance with all regulations were not one hundred percent successful However I believe that these were exceptions rather than the rule, and over the years every effort was made to ensure that the regulations were complied with, Thank-you

{"text": "<Ceasefire 1994>\n\n\n<$A> It 's nine minutes to eleven You 're watching a UTV Live special Grassroots Loyalists gave an upbeat reaction to the IRA ceasefire in a special phone-in discussion programme on the Shankill Road tonight The consensus opinion was a calm and a considered one\n<$B> The Shankill Road 's community radio station made itself available as a forum for public debate tonight, and scores of listeners availed of the opportunity Community leaders, representative of working-class Loyalist opinion, gathered for a debate and phone-in Having had twenty-four hours to study the text of the IRA statement, people 's comments were upbeat Jackie Hewitt helped man the phones\n<$C> There there was quite a few calls came in, obviously from the greater Shankill area but there was also uh phonecalls that came in from the Falls and uh from from along the Antrim Road there, from some of the Nationalist areas, making some comments, some very positive comments Uh there was one pensioner uh from the Falls Road had said that that she was delighted with the responses that was coming, coming from the group\n<$B> There was none of the paranoia so often associated with Unionism Instead Belfast journalist, Jim McDowell, who presented the programme, sensed a new pragmatism\n<$D> We heard the consensus opinion here tonight that yes, Sinn Fein are going to have to be confronted, but across a table, not at a point of a gun And they have taken on the ceasefire, there 's been no   kneejerk reaction, as I said we had twelve people from this area here tonight, all respected community representatives, and it wasn't, no ceasefire Ulster says no Protestant says no They said, we are looking at this We will consider it and then we will formulate a way to go forward and we will talk about progress\n<$B> Not one of the panellists, among them former senior UDA man Glen Barr, thought the IRA ceasefire should be rejected\n<$C> I was really surprised I mean there was no negativity at all from the group of uh varied community workers and so on around the table and from Londonderry and from other parts of the Province And uh certainly from the greater Shankill the phonecalls that were coming in judging by them uh there there there was very, still wary but very positive\n<$B> Glen Barr says the ceasefire doesn't mean a secret deal has been struck with Republicans Instead, he believes the IRA finally decided their violence was futile Protestants he says, have nothing to fear from the announcement\n<$E> I think they 've come to the same conclusion as myself, that they 've nothing to be ashamed of They should be holding their head high tonight uh because after twenty-five years of Provo violence they have come through this There 's no united Ireland\n<$B> And he had a message for Loyalist terrorists not to repeat the mistakes of the past\n<$E> I would advise the Loyalist paramilitaries that they shouldn't be first onto the streets this time These politicians who are crying for civil war and all the rest of it, let them get out onto the streets\n<$A> Well meanwhile tonight 's meeting in Belfast City Council was adjourned when the Unionist parties united to force through a motion expressing sympathy for IRA victims Earlier the Lord Mayor Hugh Smyth urged Loyalist terrorists to end their violence and the Alliance Party 's deputy leader Seamus Close applauded those comments He said he hoped the terrorists would heed Mr Smyth 's words Our reporter Conor Macauley asked the Lord Mayor for his reaction as day one of the ceasefire unfolded\n<$F> Well naturally it 's it 's it 's just too soon to be giving impressions, but the one thing that I would say that immediately after midnight the scenes that I witnessed on television this morning, with people running around wearing badges of victory were completely unhelpful But however I don't know what the badges of victory are for you know but, it 's certainly unhelpful But however I 'm still optimistic for the future\n<$B> What 's your advice now or what would you say to Loyalist paramilitaries at this stage\n<$F> Well I would I would certainly sincerely hope that the Loyalist paramilitaries would do with this statement that they did with the Joint Declaration and that would be simply to sit back, to analyse it and hopefully to be able to come forward with a positive decision, one which I would hope would mean an end to violence from all sections of our community\n<$B> Are you confident that they might too decide to lay down their guns\n<$F> Well I  I would certainly hope so I believe that there 's a whole lot of factors needs to be considered I believe that they need to be assured as I do that there will be no constitutional change in Northern Ireland without the wishes of the greater number of people And I believe that if that can be given that there is real hope for a lasting peace from all sections of the community\n<$A> Now twenty-three hours on, two key questions remain Is the IRA ceasefire permanent and forever And there 's been some movement on that today But the other question remains almost entirely unanswered How will the Loyalist terror groups react Well for an assessment I 've been talking to David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party He 's a man believed to have an insight into the thinking of Loyalists paramilitary groups And incidentally the interview was recorded before Albert Reynolds made his television appeal tonight David Ervine do Loyalist groups have any problem with the wording of the IRA ceasefire\n<$G> Words are merely words Uhm the Unionist people would have every cause to be dubious about IRA words because they 've suffered so brutally at the hands of the IRA in relation to their actions I suppose it 's a cliche/ but action speaks louder than words and certainly the Unionist people will be analyzing every deed of the IRA and possibly every word from here on in\n<$A> So it doesn't really matter whether it 's a complete cessation or a permanent cessation on paper It 's what happens over the next weeks and months that counts\n<$F> Interpretation uh is everything Uhm we will place our interpretation on that, uhm I 'm sure the Nationalist people will do the same, international, it 'll be done the same But uh we 'll all have different opinions on what the IRA are up to I 'm sure\n<$A> How do you think the Loyalist terror groups are going to respond,\n<$F> The Loyalists terror groups in my opinion uhm, like the rest of Unionism, are fearful of one thing They 're not fearful of an IRA ceasefire Indeed I think they probably welcome an IRA ceasefire because perhaps finally, after twenty-five bloody years, the IRA have realised that you cannot bomb or coerce more than one million British citizens into a united Ireland I think the great fear within Unionism at the moment is based solely, solely on their position, their constitutional position within the United Kingdom Tragically we 've been excluded consistently from any involvement in discussions relating to what 's happening in Northern Ireland John Major talks to Albert Reynolds, Albert Reynolds to John Hume, John Hume to Gerry Adams And indeed any permutation of the four Tragically when people speak behind closed doors about you, and you 're not invited to attend, you 'd not even made aware of what happens afterwards, then it is reasonable to assume it 's not in your best interests\n<$A> So there 's clear mistrust there, but again the question is\n<$F> Clear mistrust\n<$A> Yeah\n<$F> I would have said that was an understatement\n<$A> Sure But the question is what about the Loyalist terror groups, the UVF the UFF How are they likely to respond to this ceasefire\n<$F> I think it isn't a question of response to this ceasefire I think that there, that it is, for public record that they have said consistently that if the IRA stopped they would stop But uh unfortunately it isn't quite as simple as that They have also uhm I think last year uh given a list of of six principles, the first and foremost of which was that there should be no dilution of Northern Ireland 's position as a a partner within the United Kingdom Now tragically, Unionist perception is that there could be a notion of dilution Uh this this government has hardly behaved exceptionally towards Unionism and tragically they 're now paying the price because these people don't really believe them And somehow, they 're going to have to convince Unionists that they 're safe in their constitutional position\n<$A> And if they did that\n<$F> I think it would stop\n<$A> If the Loyalists terrorist groups were convinced that the constitutional issue was not up for grabs, that Northern Ireland stays part of the United Kingdom until the majority decide otherwise\n<$F> Uh hm\n<$A> Loyalist terrorism will stop\n<$F> I think so Yes I I think that the uhm in the best interests of their people uhm they would stop   it 's important that that people realise that the Loyalist paramilitaries have never put any uh proviso on the IRA stopping Indeed they 've called often for the IRA to stop and we will stop But essentially, it must be within the parameters of a United Kingdom\n<$A> The Anglo-Irish Agreement made it clear, the Downing Street Declaration makes it clear, John Major repeatedly makes it clear that nothing will happen without the consent of the majority So what does he have to do to overcome the mistrust\n<$F> But whom did they make it clear to\n<$A> Public statements\n<$F> Mm The problem with that Mike would be that, huh, the Unionist population have heard our Prime Minister speak that he would be sick to the pit of his stomach at the thought of speaking to the IRA In a matter of days he had to admit that his government were speaking to the IRA I 've already alluded to the fact that we have consistently been left out of the political argument in Northern Ireland It is only lately that this new grand committee has stopped the totally undemocratic policy of order in council We 're a, a disenfranchised alienated people who have a right to exist with our culture and our ethos intact and we have a right to our nationality It ill becomes anyone to expect me or anybody like me to dilute my nationality to bolster someone else 's This is a nationality question I am British, the people out there are British and wish to remain so And I might point out that they 're not all Protestants\n<$A> But are these people, and they would be largely viewed as Loyalists, now what Nationalists were twenty-five years ago Out in the cold, disenfranchised, disillusioned\n<$F> Fair point It 's a fair point I won't deny that there were ills of the past Ills carried out by the few in the name of the many Those ills have gone I say now quite simply that to elevate one section of our community above another will not work and there is historical proof to suggest that it will not work\n<$A> But do we have a Catch Twenty-two situation in that you are saying it is up to the Prime Minister to convince us but we don't trust the Prime Minister\n<$F> Well there is a problem there I think that that can be got round I think that certainly uh if this British government are telling the truth uh Unionism will be quick to pick it up\n<$A> How are they going to do that Who are they going to look to to convince them there is fear there 's uncertainty in the Unionist stroke Loyalist community They look not to a leader but to leaders who are giving out very different signals Very different signals\n<$F> I accept that I appreciate that Uh whatever signals they 're giving and uh Jim Molyneaux 's comments on Monday might be  indicative of the fact that even moderate Unionists can be angry when they see the triumphalism and the arrogance of Nationalism I I suggest to you that John Major might consider summoning the two Loyalists leaders and attempting to convince them And since their positions are so diverse that if he can convince them I 'm fairly certain that they can convince the Unionist population", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

informers are handled\n<$H> The issue is the grave duty we all have and particularly legal people have of protecting human life When one reads the newspaper report, if it 's true, a lot of  innocent lives have been taken then that could 've been protected and that could 've been avoided A lot of misery has been caused and grief, to to a lot of families A lot of young men have been brought into

treated for shock A soldier remains critically ill Two other soldiers and two policemen were also hurt The rest of the injured were all civilians\n<$B> Three mortars were launched from a lorry by the IRA gang on the police army base in the centre of Newry Two landed inside injuring five The third overshot the station and landed in nearby Catherine Street Over twenty-five were injured here, including a two year old child\n<$C> It was just about five minutes to nine I was coming down the stairs of the workshop here and heard a loud explosion Uh on hearing that I came out onto the street and went round the corner obviously, police barracks wasn't too far away and that was my first suspicion So at that stage shrapnel started falling down round us here There was several pieces of metal just fell very close to us here in the vicinity and then there was two further bangs uh uh the third one being the loudest So we just\n\n<$C> Well at that stage when I looked up the street you could see absolutely nothing only dust, and several people came running down the street bleeding heavily\n<$D> We 're all a bit shaky now Uh a couple of nuns coming in as well They were fairly badly shaken as well Uh they were taken up to the hospital as well for shock uhm, a young fella running down as well, he got caught with glass so he did in his hand uh His hand just actually opened up like a book He like he got caught in the middle of it He 'd a glass through his\n<$B> A senior police officer in the area says the terrorists hold the people of Newry in complete disregard\n<$E> This was a completely mindless attack uh this morning which really so easily could have turned into a major disaster These uhm these imbeciles lobbed what amounts to three gas cylinders across commercial property over the top of uh a very busy street uh towards the police station Now one of the mortars as you will have noticed behind me uh crashed into the street beside the uh commercial property in between the uh police station and and uh and uh shop, exploded causing fairly severe damage The other two mortars uh landed inside the base causing uh severe structural damage to the building Now we totally condemn this uh attack\n<$B> Those injured, thirty-three in all, were ferried to Daisy Hill Hospital in the town Newry Council 's vice-chairman talked to some of them\n<$F> I talked to a woman at seventy years of age who was blown out of her bed I talked to a young girl about twenty-one that just could not stop crying with shock I 've talked to a mother of one young boy that has gone to theatre for surgery It makes me very mad and very angered to think that the people who planted this were bound to know that there would be civilian casualties\n<$B> The Presbyterian Moderator was also there to give support to the injured\n<$G> I would utterly condemn those who have been responsible for uh such a callous crime and I would call it a crime, to aim uh mortars at a police station, one doesn't know where they 're actually going to fall and obviously a good many uh civilians along with security forces have been injured today and so we condemn it utterly\n<$B> Daisy Hill has a disaster emergency plan which swung into operation within minutes of the mortars exploding\n<$H> The injuries   range from severe life-threatening injuries in the most seriously injured uh to uh shock and uh you know emotional upset\n<$B> How would you say the hospital coped this morning\n<$H> I think we coped very well We were we reacted within a few minutes We had uh as I say a full trauma team standing by uh of comprising emergency personnel, surgeons anaesthetists There was an ambulance at the scene when I got there and I was at the scene of the explosion within a few minutes\n<$B> At least three of those injured, a policeman and two soldiers, were later transferred to hospital in Belfast One civilian is still being treated at Daisy Hill Army bomb experts have spent the entire day working on the tipper lorry the terrorists used as a launching pad for their mortars It was hijacked near Silver Bridge last night and parked on the other side of the base early this morning It 's not the first time the IRA has attacked this base In nineteen eighty-five ten mortars were launched at it, killing nine police officers It was the highest death toll suffered by the RUC since the beginning of the Troubles Just a short time ago the Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew visited Newry to see for himself the damage caused in this latest attack\n\n<$A> Cardinal Cathal Daly has repeated that the IRA campaign is morally sinful and evil In his first comments since last weekend 's Sinn Fe/in conference he said Sinn Fe/in can play a full part in the political process when the IRA ceases violence The Cardinal also called for a full investigation into the murder of Roseanne Mallon after the discovery of a camera near the scene of the shooting in County Tyrone He said serious questions needed to be asked about the circumstances of the killing to allay understandable suspicion And this afternoon the RUC denied there was photographic evidence about the murder of Mrs Mallon However a statement says operations carried out by the army are in support of the RUC They were authorised at senior police level after careful consideration The RUC says the equipment discovered in County Tyrone is not the property of those who are now holding it The police say a criminal offence is being committed and they 're not receiving the co-operation that is required Loyalist paramilitary groups including the UVF and the UFF have attacked Unionist politicians over their public disagreements about the way forward here In a statement the Combined Loyalist Military Command said what they called the petty bickering and personal acrimony should give way to calm and reasonable debate between the Ulster Unionists and the DUP\n<$I> The ink was barely dry on the Downing Street Declaration before the cracks started to appear in relations between the DUP and the Ulster Unionists The DUP roundly rejected the agreement, the Unionists gave it a guarded welcome And the divisions are still wide Only this week the DUP told John Major they wouldn't be having anything to do with plans for inter-party talks while the Unionists said they were ready willing and able to talk The strains between the two Unionist parties have also led to personal attacks, the most controversial, Ian Paisley 's branding of Jim Molyneaux as a Judas But now the Combined Loyalist Military Command which includes the UVF and the UFF have called for an end to what they call the petty bickering and personal acrimony They say there 's dismay at the lack of cohesive leadership at what they say is the time of Ulster 's greatest need David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party is close to Loyalist thinking\n<$J> I imagine that 's the statement today is not about apportioning the blame to specific people The realities are of course that uh we have just suffered a relatively acrimonious uh election We 've had many calls uh, cat calls if you like about one or the other The reality is while  all that 's going on uh people in this country are burying their dead, or bandaging their wounded and are worrying about the black hole which looks to be the future Uh we can do much better uh to face the monolith of as Sinn Fe/in would call it, Nationalist Ireland Unionism must weld together, must get their act together\n<$K> If anyone looks they 'd be hard pressed to find where where we have been involved in in name-calling I think we 've got to get back to a more mature relationship where mature people can agree to disagree and agree on the on the higher and the more important points\n<$L> I see what caused the differences in the past now beginning to unravel I think that even the most optimistic of  of people cannot believe that the Downing Street Declaration is the way to peace in Northern Ireland\n<$I> The statement from the Combined Loyalist Military Command also refloats an idea they first suggested several months ago for a forum encompassing all shades of Unionist opinion Nothing was done about it then and it would appear that the two Unionist parties are divided about its potential value now\n<$L> I think that if you 're going to have a common approach then obviously you must talk about what that approach is going to be and what your goal is going to be and the best way of  Unionists talking is to talk within some kind of forum\n<$K> I I would uh doubt if a forum can resolve the problem if the if uh the present situation continues uh uh as I say I believe that it can be resolved without that but we 'll look at that when it, when if it arises\n<$A> Fire Chiefs believe the deaths of twenty year old Margaret Wilson and thirty year old Kenneth McPeake in a blaze in a flat in Ballymena this morning may have been prevented if a smoke alarm had been fitted to the building The cause of the fire is still being investigated\n<$M> The flames were spotted by a passer-by in the flat above commercial premises in Thomas Street just after six-thirty this morning The fire brigade were on the scene in minutes\n<$N> Prior to our arrival there was a, a number of people in the street and the young lady who died in this fire was seen at the bedroom window and the, the people were  coaxing this young lady to jump For some reason she did not jump The room filled with smoke behind her and she disappeared into the smoke and sadly uh she died in the, in the fire\n<$M> The dead woman was twenty year old Margaret Wilson who lived at the flat Thirty year old Kenneth McPeake from Ballykeele in the town was the other victim Neighbours say the young woman had just moved into the flat about three months ago They say there appeared to be a party there last night The deaths have stunned the community\n<$O> Well I looked out about a quarter to seven I heard glass breaking I thought it was windows getting broke I looked out and it was the place across the street was on fire And then there was an awful loud bang and the smoke seemed you 'd have thought it was coming out the roof and everywhere you know It was well gone when I saw it Nobody could ever <unclear> several sylls </unclear>\n<$M> The fire brigade believe the fire started in the living-room The bodies of the two young victims were found upstairs They did not appear to have been burned but died of smoke inhalation The Fire Chief at the scene says if the building had been fitted with a smoke alarm they might have had a chance to escape\n<$N> My advice to people is, get a smoke alarm, test it weekly, have an escape plan for your home You may be cut off from certain parts of your home in a fire Have alternative routes to get out, and put it into practice It is vitally important that we do that\n<$A> And that 's it from the news desk for now I 'll be here with more news in about

priests The number of priests involved is about four hundred That 's around one percent of all American Catholic priests, and the Pope who 's planning to visit the continent in August has accused some media of sensationalism A Vatican spokesman said the percentage of priests involved may be less than that of other sectors of the general population But the Vatican and the bishops are clearly worried and the bishops are said to be unhappy with the Vatican 's attitude The Vatican has rejected suggestions that guilty priests should be sacked without appeal Meanwhile the bishops have recommended a wide-ranging programme, including paying for therapy for victims The final cost to the church will be millions of dollars in lawsuits but as Kevin Cullen of the Boston Globe newspaper told Paddy O'Flaherty, it 's proving impossible to establish the scale of the problem\n\n<$B> Within the past hour the security forces have removed a man 's body It had been lying thirty yards inside the border in an isolated area near Killeter outside Castlederg, for the past twenty-four hours Throughout the day there was a heavy security force presence in the area and helicopters checked the countryside for booby-trapped devices The RUC have made no comment yet about the identity of the victim, but it 's understood he was a twenty-three year old man from the Beechmount area of West Belfast It 's believed a priest contacted a family there at the request of the police to ask if their son was missing from home\n<$A> The Security Minister Michael Mates who 's been under pressure over the Asil

affair\n\n<$A> With a look at the consequences of Mr Mates ' resignation here 's our political editor Jim Dougal\n<$C> Mr Mates ' resignation means that within the past month Sir Patrick Mayhew has lost his two most senior ministers, Jeremy Hanley promoted from Political Development to the Armed Services Department, and now Michael Mates gone from Security and Finance Since the storm broke over Mr Mates ' gift of a watch to the fugitive tycoon Asil Nadir, and allegations that he had persistently lobbied the Attorney General over his prosecution, the affair has been an embarrassment to the Stormont Law and Order Minister The wider row over contributions to the Conservative Party also ensured that Mr Mates ' relationship with Mr Nadir continued to be highlighted, eventually making his position untenable His resignation could not come at a worse time for Sir Patrick Mayhew As he attempts to get the political parties in the Province back to the negotiating table his minister for Political Development, Michael Ancram is new to the job and is still reading himself in He 's likely to be left in a similar position in the sensitive Security Ministry Tonight Sir Patrick has assumed a responsibility for Mr Mates ' former government department until a new minister is appointed\n<$A> Army bomb disposal experts are still dealing with a suspect van on the Upper Lisburn Road in

drizzle in the west by morning minimum temperatures eight or nine Celsius\n\n\n<$D> Traffic across Belfast appears to be flowing quite well this morning It 's just building up in all the normal places with no unusual problems so far People heading to Larne Harbour should note that there are lane closures on the main Larne dual carriageway between Corr 's Corner and the Doagh Road Delays are likely so passengers should allow extra time for the journey And drivers are warned to be careful in the vicinity of the roadworks on the M1 between Moira and Sprucefield, where the contra-flow is still in operation The Maracycle left Belfast Kings Hall at seven thirty this morning This will affect traffic on the main Belfast to Newry Road as the race heads south Finally at the International Airport the Air Canada flight AC096 from Toronto, that 's due into Belfast at ten past ten this morning, will now be arriving at eleven forty-five The outbound AC097 will also be delayed It 's now due to leave at

the prospects Donald Campbell 's on the line from the Met Office at Aldergrove Good morning again Donald\n<$F> Good morning Uh not too bad There is a lot of cloud around as you say at the moment but it 's uh quite a nice morning otherwise That cloud will thin and break for a time and I think we 'll see some good sunny spells later this morning and into the afternoon It will turn more cloudy once again from the west and uh there will be some rain reaching the far west this evening, and it will spread slowly to all parts overnight tonight\n<$E> Well now what about the outlook Donald\n<$F> The outlook It 's actually going to be quite warm uh, tomorrow and Sunday and uh into the start of next week, but uh I think there 'll be a lot of cloud around initially tomorrow and and at first on Sunday But uh the emphasis still on a lot of dry weather\n<$E> That 's good to hear, and thank-you very much for it That was Donald Campbell on the line from the Met Office at Aldergrove\n\n\n<$E> A

draw a personal weapon as his killers approached him David Morgan reports\n<$H> The fifty-seven year old council worker was murdered outside his home at Lime Grove by two gunmen dressed in cycling clothes Apparently Mr Lyness saw them approach and drew his own weapon but was killed before he could defend himself The gunmen then fled on bicycles through Lurgan Park Mr Lyness had served with the Ulster Defence Regiment for twenty years but left about twelve months ago Church of Ireland Rector Ken Goods spoke to the murdered man 's family after the shooting, and he 's appealed for no retaliation for the killing\n<$I> I would certainly discourage any kind of retaliation, or any kind of impulsive action, and I know that the family wouldn't want this sort of grief and horror uh to happen to any other innocent family\n<$H> Detectives investigating the murder want to hear from anyone who may have seen the two killers cycle away from the scene of the shooting They were dressed in black cycling shorts and yellow jerseys\n<$A> A man 's body has been found near Lisburn The police say it was discovered in the Magheraleagh Road area, around half past ten last night It had been there for some time It 's now known that the man murdered by the IRA and whose body was found on the Tyrone border on Wednesday had been missing from his West Belfast home for twelve days The IRA said

relationship with the conservative party Mr Nadir speaking to ITN from his home in Northern Cyprus said he 'd met the former party chairman Kenneth Baker, who had raised the issue of party funding Mr Baker 's office has confirmed that a meeting did take place, but said he had no recollection of money being discussed Meanwhile supporters of the former Stormont Security Minister have claimed there was a concerted campaign to force him from office Michael Mates resigned yesterday after the latest in a series of damaging leaks when a newspaper printed a letter he 'd written to the Attorney General on behalf of Mr Nadir Friends say the timing of the leaks hasn't just been coincidental, but other backbenchers say Mr Mates was right to leave when he did From Westminster Rita Chakrabarty reports\n\n<$A> In the Commons last night the Secretary of State repeated his determination to restart the talks process here, and he suggested involving more people from Northern Ireland to try to find a solution Sir Patrick Mayhew said he hoped that this would lead to a renewed desire for a settlement, but Seamus Mallon of the SDLP said he didn't think an early start to the talks was likely\n<$J> I don't think there 's anybody here believes, that the talks are going to resume, in the autumn Is there I 'm not sure that anybody in the government benches believe it I 'm not sure

about re-routing the parade People living in the area also continued to campaign for the march to be halted A senior Orange Order official said the decision to re-route the parade was the result of

who had no jobs He also spoke of political alienation\n<$C> There 's first of all the alienation between uh the Roman Catholic or Republican uh Nationalist community and the British government, there 's increasingly an alienation I think between the Loyalist and, and unionists and the British government But then there is that ongoing alienation between the two communities You see I want to put it that way It comes through a a a lot of good neighbourliness, the rolling back of the border, the movement of population from west of the Bann to east of the Bann, the whole ghettoisation of Belfast We 've been through all this before I think we 've seen instances of this alienation which is incurring where Twenty-five   twenty five years ago people lived reasonably happily together Where there 's a

'd lived in the Rathcoole estate on the outskirts of Belfast for six years The local MP says people there are hurt that such a brutal murder should bring shame to their area\n<$B> The gunmen broke into the upstairs flat in Camross Park to carry out the attack Bobby Monaghan was forty-four and worked in the family pub in the docks area He and his girlfriend arrived home from work just after two o'clock this morning Neighbours said they heard footsteps running up the stairs and then Mr Monaghan 's girlfriend pleading with the gunmen not to shoot him After a brief struggle though he was shot and died a short time later The two masked gunmen escaped on foot and later the Loyalist paramilitary group the UFF said it was responsible for the murder The family pub where Mr Monaghan worked with his brothers has been targeted by the UFF In June a rocket attack damaged it and three years ago it was wrecked in an IRA bombing The Monaghan family who are Catholics had moved from Rathcoole to Twinbrook some years ago They say they 're now devastated by the murder of an innocent man\n<$C> It 's desperate, desperate The whole family is devastated by it, you know Like we 'd be been all been at sea for twenty-one years Robert was at sea for twenty-seven Never drank All he liked was a sing-song Shot dead for what, for nothing My God, it 's unbelievable\n<$B> Following the last bombing the family says the bar was just getting back to normal\n<$C> We 've got all our mixed community back again The bar 's running doing well and like we 're just, as you can see we 're fixing the lounge So I don't know People just won't let decent people live That 's what it 's all about\n<$B> People living near the flat were plainly afraid to talk publicly on the murder, but the local MP says that the majority are hurt at the brutal act which has brought shame on their area and are keen that Catholics shouldn't move out\n<$D> I would say to the few Catholics that are there, they have lived, many of them for twenty-five years and more in the area, to be confident that their neighbours, that they 've lived with, feel deeply hurt that this has happened and that they will be vigilant and care for them and that they should remain\n<$B> Roy Beggs says people in the estate are terrorised by both the UFF and the UVF and that the police there need extra resources to stamp out crime\n<$D> It 's time the Newtownabbey police uh applied for and got greater resources to get Rathcoole properly under control\n<$B> The last murders in Newtownabbey were also carried out by Loyalists who fired shots into a workman 's hut at Rushe Park One Protestant man died immediately and a second man died three weeks later Both lived in Rathcoole\n<$E> Assessors are still calculating the cost of the damage caused by the overnight firebomb attacks in Belfast But it 's estimated it will run into hundreds of thousands of pounds One company says it may have to lay off its employees while its premises are repaired It 's seven months since terrorists have carried out a concerted firebomb attack in the city\n<$F> What 's described as a blast incendiary caused extensive damage to a bicycle and car accessory shop in High Street And just yards away, a device started a fire in the Nova shop Its owner says that stock has been destroyed and there 's severe structural damage Also in the city centre a firebomb caused some damage to the Roost Bar which is just off High Street In South Belfast, a furniture store at Boucher Crescent was destroyed, even though a security guard saw the device ignite\n<$G> I spoke to him this morning, very very lucky to survive He says it, it just burst into flames He tried to put it out with a CO-two fire extinguisher, and basically the the heat and also the fumes uh drove him out of the building at which he called the fire brigade\n<$F> Another fire in the same complex was seen and put out The device which caused it was missed in an earlier search of the premises\n<$H> The police informed us today that even when you 're looking for the incendiaries, they 're almost impossible to find Uhm if they want to plant them they 'll plant them places you will not find them\n<$F> Where was this one hidden\n<$H> Inside a mattress, actually inside the mattress They 'd sliced the mattress and pushed it far in\n<$F> It 's the first time since the start of the year that firebombs, a weapon often favoured by the IRA, have been used Businesses say such devices cause damage beyond the cost of replacing stock and repairing buildings\n<$G> It 's just disturbing to think that people can go round doing this, taking people 's jobs from them and, having people basically be put out of their work overnight I mean that 's what 's happened here We 're back to square one I mean your suppliers in England, they 're not the most understanding people you 'll ever meet I mean they don't understand the situation here And when you phone them up to say listen by the way we, we can't sort out what credit we have with you whatever whatever, they 're going to, say you know, we can't supply people in Northern Ireland anymore cos the it 's just too risky\n<$F> Once again the police have appealed to people to check their business premises before leaving for the night\n<$E> The police say the thirty-one bomb alerts across Belfast today were a nightmare for shoppers and business people All of the alerts turned out to be hoaxes, some were caused by vehicles being abandoned, others by warning calls An RUC spokesman said the hoaxes made it almost impossible for the emergency services to function An ambulance transferring a baby between hospitals got stuck in traffic at Broadway, and the police had to be called to clear a way for it Controlled explosions were carried out on twelve vehicles abandoned in the south, north and west of the city\n<$A> As Sinn Fe/in prepares for its special conference this weekend at which it says it 'll give its definitive response to the Downing Street Declaration, the Taoiseach Albert Reynolds has again said that no party or paramilitary organisation can have a veto over political progress And the Republic 's deputy prime minister Dick Spring has repeated that only a permanent cessation of IRA violence would allow Sinn Fe/in to have a place at the conference table\n\n<$A> Jim Dougal, there are people who have a lot at stake this weekend What do you think it will make clearer for them\n<$I> Well a lot of people have a lot at stake in that uh after all the Declaration is the government 's Declaration John Hume and Gerry Adams have a lot at stake in it because of their talks But it seems that the question this weekend is not if Sinn Fe/in will say yes or no to the Declaration It seems to be from their point of view whether or not the Declaration moves what they see as the Peace Process forward and the answer to that appears to be yes but it doesn't seem to be moving it forward, far enough forward should I say uh for the IRA to call an end to violence or even a ceasefire And when you ask Sinn Fe/in about this they say that it 's a matter for the IRA to read their definitive response to the Declaration, uh uh they they have no advice for them on it\n<$A> Well is this a watershed, or, are those who have invested so much going to persevere with Sinn Fe/in and the IRA\n<$I> Well I think it 's always been the case that if this process goes on and on and the uh Sinn Fe/in cannot at the end of the day deliver an end to the IRA campaign that people like John Hume and Albert Reynolds would have to accept uh that it hasn't worked But at the moment I think Albert Reynolds in particular seems to believe uh that there is merit in continuing He talks uh in speeches uh to Nationalists, he talks about the benefits of the Declaration and the benefits that there would be of uh a a complete end to violence Now I think that because he 's doing that he seems, to think that he can in some way influence the debate which is going on within uh the Republican movement and I think no matter what happens this weekend that that uh is likely to continue\n<$A> Jim Dougal, thank-you very much\n<$E> Two judges at the High Court in London have said they intend to refer the ban on Gerry Adams visiting Britain to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg The pressure group Liberty which acted on behalf of the Sinn Fe/in president claims it 's an historic decision against the government which opposed the case being referred to the European Court\n<$A> Two people have been killed in a road accident near Banbridge It happened on the main Belfast to Newry Road A car and a tanker lorry collided near the Rathfriland junction at Banbridge It 's emerged that the local council has been asking for some years for a roundabout to be built at the site of the crash Dot Kirby has been to the scene\n<$J> What remains of a Vauxhall Nova The man and woman inside were killed when it was in collision with a lorry The force carried it two hundred yards underneath the truck, then both burst into flames The junction is an accident black-spot\n<$K> You just live in terror You hear a thud, awful thud, and you just, your heart sinks My legs fail me almost I 'm a nurse myself and I am really worried  it 's just my my my my my legs just go under me and I think about what, what is out here on the road to face\n<$J> Fire crews say it was one of the worst accidents they 've ever been to\n<$L> They discovered in fact the lorry burning fiercely, and unfortunately the remains of the car as you see now was, bedded underneath the front of the lorry It was really horrendous Uh there was wreckage, and uh there  there was a lot of smoke and debris lying about\n<$J> The car was coming from Rathfriland, the lorry was heading towards Newry Banbridge District Council have been campaigning for a roundabout at the junction for three years\n<$M> I 'll be pressing for that now with all vigour When you 're here and see what has happened it really comes home to you\n<$J> The Department of the Environment are already planning to make the junction safer They 'll be investigating today 's and earlier accidents to see if any further action is needed But whether a roundabout or anything else man-made would have prevented today 's carnage, no-one will ever know\n<$E> The headlines so far this

the Environment, this is not actually against the law, although they do say it is in breach of planning control So environmentalists now want the planners to act to save the boglands by putting more emphasis on conservation\n<$B> Northern Ireland 's peat bogs are a vital home for rare plant and animal life Under a government scheme four important peatland areas are to be given special protection by the end of the summer In another development Fermanagh District Council plans to buy three thousand acres of peatland here on Cuilcagh Mountain, and turn it into a nature reserve Now conservationists say smaller bogs must be protected as well\n\n<$B> While some large areas of bogland are to be protected many small bogs are being excavated, often without approval The Department of the Environment has confirmed that this farmer near Balnamallard in Fermanagh is extracting peat from his land without the necessary planning permission These pictures were taken after the DOE wrote to him asking him to stop\n<$C> Do the Department know that we 've been continuously operating here for fifty years Before any planning permission was ever mentioned We 've never before been confronted, only quite recently, and we see no reason at all why we need that permission People comes with their cars and trailers here,  an odd fellow, a market gardener or whatever sends an odd lorry, and we fill him here if he wants it And it 's, it 's really only a very small sideline for us Our main object is to get this turned into a field\n<$B> Environmentalists say planners must play a greater role in helping protect boglands by placing more emphasis on conservation\n\n<$B> At the moment only six percent of the country 's natural boglands remain So far it 's difficult to gauge how planners here at DOE headquarters will respond to this call from environmentalists The Department refused to put forward a spokesman to discuss its planning procedures and their enforcement in

day out\n<$D> The Northern Ireland Office has brought in emergency legislation to cope with remand prisoners who were moved following riots which damaged cells at Crumlin Road Jail Sixty-eight cells were badly damaged earlier this month and two hundred Loyalist and Republican prisoners were moved to the Maze prison Normally they would have to be remanded every twenty-eight days, but because of the practical problems of transporting about eighty prisoners a day from the Maze to Belfast, the Secretary of State has temporarily changed the law They can now be remanded in their absence By September a remand court will be installed at the Maze and the legislation should be revoked, An incendiary device has been found at a furniture showroom in Belfast It was discovered by workers clearing up at Fairbank 's in Boucher Crescent in the south of the city The showroom was the target of firebombers last week when much of the stock was , was damaged It 's thought that the device discovered today was one of those left in the store last week It was made safe by the army and has been taken away for examination, Several people, I beg your pardon, Belfast will become a smokeless zone within the next two years according to the Council It 's warning householders they could be fined if they don't convert to cleaner fuels The aim is to reduce pollution levels but health professionals and environmental groups say Belfast 's air quality is still among the worst in the UK Marie Irvine reports\n<$E> Coronation Street style smoking chimneys should officially be a thing of the past in Belfast as the programme to convert the city to smokeless fuels reaches its final stages More than ninety percent of Belfast is already covered by smoke control orders The council says its conversion programme is on target to be complete by nineteen ninety-six It 's offering financial help to people to get them to change over to cleaner fuels\n<$F> The standard grant is a seventy percent grant whereby Belfast City Council will pay seven tenths of the approved cost of doing work If someone cannot afford to pay the three tenths involved, then further grants up to a maximum of a hundred percent are available to the like of old age pensioners or people on Income Support\n<$E> But environmental campaigners say despite the Council 's best efforts to encourage conversion, the city still has poor air quality\n<$G> In general the UK has improved their uh  sulphur dioxide and smoke emissions uh but uh here in Northern Ireland we seems to have gone really uh in a  in a roundabout and we 're back to levels that are comparable to the nineteen seventies\n<$E> The City Council 's currently trying to get people to convert to smokeless fuels Will that alleviate the air quality problem any\n<$G> Uh it will help reduce the air, or improve the air quality somewhat, but it will not go towards uh getting it below the EEC directives for uh smoke and sulphur dioxide, and it will certainly not get it below the World Health Organisation recommended levels\n<$E> But Jim Hanna insists things have improved\n<$F> If someone was to think back to the early nineteen sixties and the heavy smogs across Belfast city, they are no longer evident Uh levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide are approximately a fifth of what they were in those days, so a tremendous advantage has been uh accrued from the smoke control programme\n<$E> Anyone who wants to know more about converting their heating system should contact environmental health officers through the City Council\n<$D> Several people have been arrested following the discovery of a grenade in a launcher inside a wheeled bin in North Belfast A police patrol discovered the grenade outside a house in Hillman Street in

Jamie Nicholl is to meet his chairman at Raith Rovers tonight, following reports the Killmarnock want him as their new manager Nicholl has heard nothing uh yet official about Killmarnock 's interest and wants to clarify the situation St Johnstone were at the Oval last night with new signing George O'Boyle, who showed some nice touches but failed to mark his debut with a goal against Glentoran In fact the former Blue man was robbed, just before an excellent move that led to the only goal, the Glens ' first real attack of the game, Alan Nixon who apparently reminds manager Tommy Cassidy of himself twenty-five years ago with the perfect cross for Derek Swann to score a super goal\n<$K> I find these, pre-season games, necessary But they 're uhm, you can't get a  a real uhm, today for instance I felt that we didn't pass the ball right, we didn't have enough passes That 's my game and I intend to bring that in every time we play And I hope we improve every  uh pre-season game\n<$J> Meanwhile George O'Boyle has another game tonight at Ards, and he hopes for better luck and that his move to St Johnstone will help keep him in Brian Hamilton 's international plans\n<$L> I had a chat with Brian Uh he says like obviously, he would like to play me at the highest level I can, uh but he knew St Johnstone are a good club and an imaginative team and uhm he says if I 'm playing well and scoring goals then he 'll come and look at me\n<$J> And there 's two other games tonight, Cliftonville against Southampton and Bangor against Grimsby At the Milk Cup the draw for the under sixteen quarter finals features only one local team, County Down who 'll play Russia at Limavady tonight Manchester United play at Ballymoney The other game 's at Coleraine Gaelic football, Peter Withnall, the Down All-Ireland semi-final hero from three years ago is in a race against time to play in this year 's semi-final He 's on crutches after a cartilage operation, though with more than two weeks to recover Down are hopeful that he 'll be available for selection And Donegal will name one of these three as their new manager sometime this evening P J McGowan in the centre is the favourite ahead of Martin McHugh and Donal Reid Right let 's go racing The Galway Plate at the Galway Festival this afternoon was worth fifty thousand pounds, and featured Richard Dunwoody on Will Phone Here 's the closing stages\n\n<$J> Very close finish there Feathered Gale just catching Minister For Fun on the line Richard Dunwoody was out of contention\n<$M> Finally at a Belfast hotel today the catwalk was reserved for the men and ladies of Northern Ireland 's Commonwealth Games team, as they modelled the ninety-four lines for the Victoria showpiece It wasn't quite The Clothes Show, although boxer Paul Douglas did his very best in a white towelling dressing gown number The sweatsuits certainly met with approval from the knowledgeable fashion-conscious audience And although rainfall is not high on Vancouver Island at this time of year, cyclist Conor Henry was on parade in the wet weather gear\n<$M> Is it important for athletes when you 're going out, it 's something to think about, gear, or are you really just worried about the competition\n<$N> Uh I think it always helps, you know it 's actually, adds that bit of motivation You really feel as though you 're you 're going somewhere or you 're doing something important And that that can be the extra boost, you know, quite often in sport the bit that makes the difference at the end is motivation and high morale", "subdomain":

{"text": "<UTV Live>\n\n\n<$A> Relatives of Roseanne Mallon the seventy-six year old Tyrone woman shot dead by the UVF in May, have claimed that high-tech army surveillance equipment has been found near the scene of the shooting And they say the killers may have been caught on the cameras The Mallons have called for a full-scale enquiry into how long the cameras had been trained on their home where Miss Mallon was shot And an SDLP councillor has submitted a report to the Dublin government, which he says shares his concern over the situation\n<$B> The cameras which appeared to be sophisticated surveillance equipment including a telescopic camera and a tiny wide-angled camera were found in a field overlooking the house where seventy-six year old Roseanne Mallon was shot dead by the UVF in May She 'd been visiting her sister-in-law 's home and the UVF said she wasn't their intended target They said they 'd been trying to kill a relative who 'd been jailed in the eighties Today her nephew Christopher Mallon who didn't want to be identified said the cameras were found purely by chance\n<$C> A neighbour happened to be out   through the fields for a bit of a dander and he come across suspicious stuff in the hedge, and  investigated it and found out that it was cameras\n<$B> Mr Mallon said the telescopic camera had been dug into the ground and was trained on his house The top of the lens was encased in a camouflaged cover he said, and the wide-angle lens had been sealed inside another camouflaged coating Mr Mallon said the equipment which also included a modulator and a transmitter was connected to massive long-life battery packs which had been concealed in the ground He said neighbours were unable to remove the batteries Mr Mallon said his family wanted to know if the cameras had been in place at the time of the murder of his aunt, and if the killers had been captured by the equipment\n<$C> I believe that my auntie 's shooting, is possibly on film, and we want these films released, right away, because it 's not fair that that 's that this should happen\n<$B> Mr Mallon admitted that the cameras which he said were recovered would not have had an ideal view of his house, but he said he believed other cameras may have been hidden in the area But he said that shortly after the cameras on the hill were removed, troops saturated the area claiming they 'd received a bomb alert He said that any other cameras in the district could have been removed during that time\n<$C> I would say they 'd be taken away because like you say these people 'll go out round the country and look for more And more likely have been removed\n<$B> The Mallon family have called for a full public enquiry into the situation The Mallon family 's concerns about the cameras are shared by the local SDLP councillor Anthony McGonnell He 's backed their calls for a full public inquiry, and he 's gone one step further for he 's raised the issue with the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin\n<$D> They shared my concern very much so Absolutely My main concern, would be that they recorded that horrific murder, and that there may be vital  uh evidence available, which would lead to the apprehension of the of the people uhm responsible for that There 's a dirty underworld out there both on the terrorist side and on the security side and, it 's murky, it 's dirty, it 's, it 's uhm, something that, one of these, it 's in one of these areas where people seem to be prepared to stoop to any level to get what they want\n<$B> Councillor McGonnell said he wanted the authorities to investigate a label on the modulator bearing the name Torden Security The RUC has still made no comment about the cameras\n<$A> Army bomb experts have defused an incendiary at a Belfast furniture store which was firebombed last week Staff found the device at Fairbanks in Boucher Retail Park around three pm It 's thought it may have been timed to ignite during last week 's attack, but failed to go off A number of people are still being questioned following the discovery of a bomb in the New Lodge area of North Belfast The device was spotted by a police patrol at around midnight last night The improvised grenade had been hidden inside a wheelie bin at Hillman Street A command wire led from the bin to an entry behind houses in the street Army bomb experts carried out a controlled explosion to make it safe The Office of Fair Trading has said that there 's no evidence to launch an investigation into the price of bread In a letter to the Northern Ireland Select Committee it says the situation will be monitored but it sees no reason to take the matter further However the General Consumer Council says the matter has not been concluded and the issue is very much alive\n<$E> The General Consumer Council gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Select Committee about the price of bread in the Province on July the thirteenth The delegation was led by its Assistant Director\n<$F> The Council first investigated this issue, as far back as nineteen and eighty-nine and that was in response to quite significant numbers of complaints from consumers\n<$E> What did you have to say to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee\n<$F> We presented them with the information which we had obtained, that was information based on our own price survey and also on some of the information that had come back to us from the industry, where they had pointed out to us that they 'd higher production costs in Northern Ireland, there were other disadvantages, all of which we accept But on the best information available to us, the differential in in producing bread in Northern Ireland, at most, is between five and six pence, and of course that falls a long way short of explaining a difference of anything between seventeen and twenty-four pence\n<$E> But it 's been reported this morning that the Office of Fair Trading will not launch a formal probe into the price of bread in Northern Ireland, as it has not yet been given a reason to believe that the difference in bread prices is likely to be attributable to an abuse of a monopoly position or some particular anti-competitive practice\n<$F> Well I think that is, it 's a bit misleading, in the sense that this morning 's report in the Financial Times suggested that the matter had been concluded, and certainly having spoken to the Office of Fair Trading this morning that is not the case Uh, their investigations are continuing They have written to, as we understand it uh, the main interests, that 's the bakeries and the retailers, and they will be taking a decision later on this year as to what, if indeed any action, might be necessary\n<$E> So is it fair to say that the issue is still being investigated\n<$F> Very much so\n<$A> The province 's tourism industry is in line for another record year with visitor figures on the increase Tourist Board chiefs say local resorts are benefiting from a huge investment in hotels and attractions UTV Live took a day trip to Bangor\n<$G>  Good afternoon Bangor tourist information Oh I 'm terribly sorry our self-catering accommodation now is fully booked for the month of August There 's nothing now available until September\n<$H> Bangor 's been having a field day since D-Day The success of the commemorative weekend at the end of May has really put the town on the map\n<$G> There 's been a tremendous increase, almost a hundred percent increase in the tourist information centre, and generally the feel throughout the town is that it is packed A lot of people who came for D-Day have been coming back again, day-trippers coming for a week, the guest houses are completely booked out this time of year So it 's been extremely successful\n<$H> The development of this marina has played a major part in Bangor 's transformation from an old-fashioned rather crumbling seaside resort to a modern tourist centre But it hasn't come cheap This seafront development has cost nearly twenty million pounds, but because it 's proving a major attraction for both yachtsmen and dry land visitors, the town and the tourist board thinks it 's money well spent on developing the Province 's tourism infrastructure\n<$I> There 's been huge investment uh by hoteliers locally, in their product, in the local attractions Over a hundred million pounds of European Union International Fund for Ireland money and uh government money has been invested in the tourism infrastructure in Northern Ireland, and that has seen a number of flagship developments whether it is the Navan Centre in Armagh or whether it is the Tower Museum uh in Derry\n<$H> If Bangor 's anything to go by with its hordes of visitors and packed guest houses, the Province appears to be on course for a record year in tourism terms\n<$I> Last year was our fifth consecutive record year for tourism We had one and a quarter million visitors Uh we would hope certainly to have an increase on that this year It is however too early to say what our final year-end figures are going to be Obviously the months of August and September are going to be critical to our overall success but we 're reasonably confident that the continued growth in tourism will be uh achieved again this year\n<$H> Visitors are coming to the Province from all over the world, but just as important are the local day-trippers, who provide the bread-and-butter trade for resorts like Bangor\n<$J> The park here 's been open from the twelfth of June there last year, and one of the days we had thirty-two thousand through it Uhm still at the minute we 're still really busy Last weekend there I was in Portrush and I wouldn't compare Portrush with Bangor\n<$H> Well he would say that wouldn't he But all the resorts are proving popular this year and everyone involved with the tourist industry is looking forward to counting the receipts at the end of the season\n<$A> Mackie International of West Belfast is now attempting to win a multi-million pound order for textile machinery in Brazil Yesterday the company signed a contract worth twenty-five million pounds for new water and sewage treatment plants in Argentina It 's understood that if the deal in Brazil is successfully negotiated it 'll be worth over eight million pounds Meanwhile Mackie 's breakthrough into the field of treatment facilities which carries the prospect of a hundred additional jobs has been welcomed by the Economy Minister here\n\n<$A> And that 's the news for the moment I 'll have more in about fifteen minutes Mike\n<$K> Thank-you Kate Uh coming up, a sports reporter and a five year old girl who both have a lot to thank their fathers for The dogs we could all end up calling our best friends The sport and the weather And if you 're in the habit of pinching a parking place reserved for people with disabilities, we would like you to meet three students who fancy their chances of making you stop\n<$L> The whole idea is to embarrass the the the offending driver as much as possible and focus the attention on him on uh abusing a facility that really is not for his use Right okay Well I think it would certainly embarrass a lot of people to have that flashing over their heads\n\n<$K> It 's six sixteen You 're watching UTV Live, now I think you 'll enjoy the person you 're going to meet next She has something in common with the person she 's talking to actually, because like Stephen Watson she 's had a kidney transplant And like Stephen, her father was the donor",

{"text": "<BBC NI>\n\n\n<$A> Speaking at the scene of the attack in Newry this afternoon the Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew said the IRA don't care who they kill or maim\n\n<$A> The Catholic Primate Cardinal Cahal Daly has said the IRA 's campaign is morally evil and sinful In his first response to Sinn Fe/in 's rejection of the Downing Street Declaration Dr Daly said it was a tragedy for Republicans that the process of shaping a new political future seems set to proceed without them\n<$B> Well joining me now live from our outside broadcast unit in Newry is the Presbyterian Moderator Dr David McGaughey Good evening Moderator\n<$C> Good evening\n<$B> Uh despite the the number of injuries and the fact that some of them were serious Newry must be giving thanks today that it wasn't a lot worse\n<$C> Well certainly when I visited the police station this morning and saw what the mortars had done to the station, and also to the uh outside buildings, I feel it is a miracle that more people were not injured and certainly some people were not killed It 's a miracle I think it 's uh, but for the grace of God there would have been a lot more casualties\n<$B> What message do you think the IRA is sending with this attack in a week when Gerry Adams has been insisting that the Peace Process as he calls it is alive and well\n<$C> Well it would seem to me that they 're sending a message that they 're not really interested in peace A couple of days ago there was a policeman 's car had a booby trap bomb under it in Newcastle I think it was yesterday the forces were attacked in Belfast and now we have this terrible attack in Newry this morning And surely they 're saying through this that they 're not really interested in peace They 're talking peace, but uh with their hands, they 're going out to shed innocent blood\n<$B> Well Sinn Fe/in 's Martin McGuinness has said Sinn Fe/in is trying to create the conditions in which attacks like these would become a thing of the past\n<$C> Surely  if we are going to create conditions uh for peace, then the very first thing that we should do is to stop the violence There can't be real peace until violence and all violence is stopped, because uhm, without that there can be no, talking together, there can be no uh planning for the future and I believe that violence of all types and descriptions has to stop before peace can be established\n<$B> You 've accused the Government of reneging on its promise to clamp down on terrorism if the Downing Street Declaration failed to put an end to violence, but realistically what more can the Government do\n<$C> Well I am not a security uh advisor, but I understand uh in December the prime ministers did say that there would be a massive clampdown on terrorism if the Peace Process uh was uh rejected, and uh, I  would feel that they only said that because up until that moment uh and since then, uh they haven't been really targeting the terrorists uh as we might have expected them to do so And I would hope that uh as the terrorists have shown now that they 've no real interest in peace that the government will take strong measures and will ensure that uh people who are killing and maiming are removed from our society so that those of us who want to live in peace together can indeed uh do this I believe that this morning we had a criminal act This was a crime to me, as uh innocent people were injured, uh both in the security forces and in the civilian population\n<$B> Dr McGaughey thank-you very much for joining us this evening\n<$A> The headlines this evening Forty-four people are injured in an IRA mortar bomb attack in Newry Sir Patrick Mayhew says we have to be thankful people weren't killed by the dozen And coming later the thousands who queued for tea and buns with Donegal 's famous son\n<$B> Two people died in a fire at a flat in Ballymena this morning despite the efforts of local people to save them Police say the cause of the fire is not yet known Paul Waters reports\n<$D> The fire took the lives of thirty year old Kenneth McPeake of Ballykeele estate in the town, and twenty year old Margaret Elizabeth Wilson who lived in the flat above a kitchen furniture shop on the corner of Mount Street and Thomas Street Flames and smoke were spotted coming from the windows on the first floor around a quarter to seven this morning\n<$E> I looked over and that whole place there was burning, and uh I said to my husband the place is on fire over there And uh, then the next thing there was a big bang you know and, this was  the smoke was all flying everyplace\n<$D> People working at the nearby Fairhill Shopping Centre saw a woman upstairs in the burning flat People on the street tried to coax the woman to jump from the top floor window but she moved back out of sight and wasn't seen again The fire brigade say people on the street tried to save the pair\n<$F> People did attempt to uh a rescue, but because of the intensity of the fire, it was very very hot in there, uh it was uh thick dense smoke There is no way, without the proper equipment, or proper training that anyone could have actually got in there\n<$D> Fire fighters using breathing apparatus found two bodies on the second floor, and forensic experts have been examining the flat to determine the cause of the fire\n<$A> The Receiver appointed yesterday for the Dungiven building company P and J McNicholl says there 's no chance of saving the firm This morning thirty-five of the company 's two hundred workers were made redundant The closure has sent shock waves across the building trade in the north west\n<$G> This morning workers were still unclear about their future as they arrived for a meeting with the Receiver at the local community centre Company owner Patrick McNicholl was also there but didn't attend the actual meeting Thirty-five of the fifty men directly employed were told they 'd be made redundant The future for the rest is uncertain This man worked for the firm for nearly thirty years\n<$H> Well we haven't been told anything and I 'm here bar but to go to the dole on Monday morning Come down to Limavady\n<$G> And how 's it going to affect you now\n<$H> Well it 'll affect me uh, well I need the job I need money\n<$I> Well I 'm  unemployed now I 've no money coming in Got a house and a mortgage They 've got to be paid\n<$G> McNicholls have been involved in eighteen sites across the northwest including Derry City Council 's new six million pound offices All work ceased yesterday It 's thought the firm owes some two and a half million pounds The Receiver says there 's no hope of saving the company\n<$J> No, I I believe that the the financial situation of the company is too bad and that there is no possibility of the company surviving\n<$G> The closure is likely to have repercussions for the whole Dungiven area\n<$K> Well I think there are a lot of people will find a great deal of hardship as a result The uhm as I say the employment uh, numbers extend far beyond the immediate employment of the, direct employment of the firm itself\n<$G> The local community centre was today asked to facilitate workers in putting in benefit claims\n<$A> The season for offshore salmon fishing in the Foyle fisheries area came to an end last night It 's been the job of the government 's protection vessel to make sure boats haven't been flouting the law Our environment correspondent Kevin Magee joined the crew on their last patrol of the season\n<$L> A sight fishermen aren't always glad to see The fisheries protection vessel the Ken Vickers, carrying out a spot check to make sure they 're using the right gear at the right time The crew of this vessel has considerable powers And if necessary it can even call on the Royal Navy for support\n<$M> We as fishers inspectors are uh British sea-fishery officers and these give us powers to uh stop boats, to board boats, to look at their documents to ensure that they 're suitably licensed for the fish that they 're catching We also can ask them to haul their gear and ensure that it is uh complying with the conservation regulations Uh if needs be we can detain vessels and ask them to come to port for further investigation\n<$L> The vessel spends most of its time on the Irish sea policing trawlermen For the past six weeks it has been searching for poachers and enforcing conservation regulations on licensed salmon fishermen along the north coast Eleven court cases are now pending The vessel has a top speed of seventeen knots and can sail in anything up to force eight conditions She 's at sea one hundred and fifty days a year and during that time covers about twenty thousand miles along our coastline Another spot check and everything is in order All the salmon on board this boat were caught legally But the fishermen say the regulations are too stringent\n<$N> It really restricts our fishing hours very tight, whereas a few extra hours in the day can make all that difference\n<$O> It 's a pity we couldn't get more time at it you know as the time 's very short you know The twelve hour day 's fairly, it 's fairly short you know\n<$L> Fisheries protection can involve a sophisticated game of cat and mouse The vessel 's main weapons are speed and radar and protection is not without its moments of tension on the high seas\n<$P> Sometimes you get some very thorny situations and uh as I say, very rarely you get two the same and you 've got to just work with it as you find it and uh caution and safety for crew and the fish are upmost in your mind\n<$L> Eighty percent of salmon returning from the Atlantic end up in the fishermen 's nets The inspectorate says if it wasn't doing its job salmon may never make it past the final hurdle on their journey back to our rivers\n<$B> Kevin Magee braving the high seas for us there and we stay with a nautical theme Yachtsmen and women from all over Britain are setting course for Carrickfergus this

doors open on a multi-million pound winter sales boom  Good evening Four Catholic priests have been murdered in Algeria less than twenty-four hours after French anti-terrorist police killed four Algerian gunmen who hijacked an Air France plane The four White Fathers three Frenchmen and a Belgian were killed by Islamic fundamentalists at their presbytery sixty-five miles east of Algiers The murdered Belgian priest is in this video of a funeral at their Algerian church taken seven months ago\n<$B> The French prime minister Eduard Balladur forecast more attacks on French people in Algeria even before today 's murders He 'd previously advised all French to get out Mr Balladur also fears possible attacks by some of the five million Algerians inside France Today 's killings cast a pall over his visit to wounded hijack survivors As the unhurt passengers finally reached their destination Paris some revealed they 'd heard the four hijackers whisper that they planned to crash or blow up the plane over the French capital The Interior Minister Charles Pasqua has confirmed that at least ten sticks of dynamite have been found on the plane and the plan to cause a catastrophe in Paris which would have cost far more lives than that of the three hostages killed in Algiers and the hijackers in yesterday 's Marseille storming,  The gendarmes who carried out the rescue got a heroes ' welcome So did the crew,  Confirmed casualties from yesterday 's bitter fire fight, three crew including the co-pilot who jumped from the cockpit and is seriously ill, thirteen passengers and nine police As well as dynamite and a gun held to the pilot 's head the hijackers had a bomb behind his seat Some hostages believe two passengers were accomplices because they moved to the back of the plane when it was seized as if to keep watch but no passengers have yet been arrested\n<$A> Russian president Boris Yeltsin insisted today that Chechnya was still an integral part of the Russian federation In a national broadcast the president said the breakaway republic was threatening the stability of the entire country Mr Yeltsin ordered his troops to continue to disarm what he called illegal armed groups in Chechnya However he said there will be no more bombing of civilian areas in the Chechen capital Grozny\n\n<$C>  In a live Moscow broadcast to the Russian people President Yeltsin hammered home his message No territory has the right to secede and Chechnya is as he put it part and parcel of the Russian federation In the war-torn Chechen capital of Grozny distraught people huddled together hanging on the president 's every word Mr Yeltsin told them that there would be an end to the bombing of civilian areas in Grozny but that law and order must be restored in the breakaway republic He said criminal elements in Chechnya were threatening the stability of the entire country and ordered his troops to carry out their patriotic duty and disarm what he called thugs and bandits These latest pictures from Grozny come in the aftermath of overnight shelling The city has been brought to its knees and hundreds of people have been killed President Yeltsin 's assurances of no more civilian casualties brought little comfort to bereaved Chechens Many were also angered at the way he referred to the Chechen fighters They in turn accused Russian troops of failing to turn up for peace talks earlier today In the village of Argun to the east of Grozny Chechen fighters left their positions, raised a white flag and went to designated meeting points but apparently the Russians never showed Chechen forces are now in defiant mood Despite a heavy Russian presence of forty thousand men the troops have not been able to break the stalemate at key positions east and west of the capital Grozny and heavy fighting is reported to be continuing in sub-zero temperatures The Chechens have vowed to destroy Russian tanks with their rocket grenades and Russian soldiers with their Kalashnikovs But behind the tough talking Chechen rebels are anticipating an all-out Russian helicopter gunship and tank assault on Grozny Despite massive pressure Chechen president Dzhokar Dudayev and Russia 's President Yeltsin are clearly in no mood to crack Amidst the uncertainty and volatile calm a semblance of festive cheer took hold in Chechnya today People danced and sang to better times in nineteen ninety-five but the longed-for political settlement to the tiny Muslim republic 's three year independence bid is nowhere in sight\n<$A> A five year old boy died in a fire at his home in Waterford this morning The boy was trapped in a back bedroom of his home in the Ballybeg housing estate He was Stephen Walsh son of Michael and Mary Walsh Mr Walsh is undergoing treatment for smoke inhalation He tried to get back into the house to rescue his son In England there has been strong criticism of police after they shot dead a cowboy enthusiast described locally as a Walter Mitty character Forty-four year old Bob Dickson was shot on his doorstep in Huddersfield West Yorkshire Police said he had fired at them twice and had refused to put down his gun but a friend of the dead man claimed his weapons used in Wild West style sharpshooting competitions only fired blanks A senior police officer stressed that it was impossible for police to know that, and that anyone firing at them must expect them to fire back, Sport now and the big race at Leopardstown was the Findus Handicap Chase We join the commentary as the frontrunners approach the last fence\n<$D> At the

Scribbler in third and then High Peak They 're up at the line Belmont King is going to win it as they go to the line Belmont King takes the Findus Chase wins it by eight lengths or so and second is Sullane River third is Scribbler\n<$A> Department stores around the country have been forecasting a winter sales boom The door was opened on the first of the sales today and tens of thousands of shoppers flocked to snap up the best of the bargains\n<$E> Some say they 're a telling economic indicator Others describe them as simply the best antidote to Christmas cabin fever The winter sales burst into action all round the country today without a care apparently for teaming rain stretched bank accounts or even more sorely stretched credit cards  You have plenty spare money to spend on the sales over the next few days\n<$F> Not not really after Christmas, but however, a little anyway\n<$G> I 'm just looking\n<$E> What sort of things are you looking for\n<$G> Bargains\n<$H> Tagging along

positive We 'd a very good run up to Christmas and to get a reaction like this after all of that we 're very pleased Uhm we are certainly going to come under pressure now for merchandise if this was to continue So we 're very positive\n<$E> But for those feeling a little dog-eared and not quite up to the rough-and-tumble, Dublin dog show at the RDS was one option as a place of refuge An

less than twenty-four hours after French anti-terrorist police killed four Algerian gunmen who hijacked an Air France plane Well that 's the news so far this Tuesday Late headlines on this channel at a quarter past midnight Until then a very good evening to you\n\n<$J> Good evening Some very heavy rain over the last day or two and more heavy rain yet to come with these fronts moving up over Ireland And at the moment some heavy rain in places Overall a damp drizzly evening with a good deal of fog But there still is a huge contrast in temperatures across the country Still a cold three four

as well as they can hope for, and they stress an exemplary twenty-year record at the Tallaght plant\n<$P> This package will be explained to them honestly and straightforwardly Nobody is pretending uh

population\n\n<$F> After the signing in Sarajevo the UN special envoy Mr Akashi travelled to the self-styled Serb capital of Pale where the agreement was signed by the Serb leaders The Muslim-led Bosnian government had been holding up the signing of the agreement today to obtain tougher terms on the demilitarisation of Sarajevo and the opening of so-called blue routes to allow supplies to reach the besieged city of Sarajevo They were also demanding Serb withdrawal from the Bihac enclave in north-eastern Bosnia Meanwhile tank-shelling and artillery fire were reported from Bihac today even as the truce was under negotiation The four-month ceasefire agreement arises from the peace mission to Bosnia earlier this month by the former US president Jimmy Carter The UN hopes that it will

appalling weather conditions Hospital patients and stranded holiday-makers were among those airlifted to and from Inisturk and Clare Island\n<$G> It was a race against Old Father Time and the elements themselves as the air corps crew mounted its last mission of the old year off the Mayo coast this afternoon Working in sometimes driving rain and near gale-force winds it brought this group of islanders and stranded holiday-makers from Clare Island to the mainland\n<$H> It was a pleasure getting uh airlifted instead of battling with the sea It was lovely\n<$I> That 's what we needed inside We need a helicopter all the time\n<$J> We need one permanently  We really do\n<$K>  It 's first ride in a helicopter and uh I keep saying my brother 's in the Airforce in England and uh I keep trying to get a ride in a harrier but maybe I can now  having gone in a helicopter with the Irish Government first \n<$G> Eighteen people were airlifted from the two islands in a series of high-speed hops But about a dozen others were left stranded as the weather conditions deteriorated They included the island 's curate\n<$L> There are people and there are uh husbands here and wives on the island who are rushing for uh flights and for uh boats to England and they 're stranded there for the night\n<$G> And you 're not sure whether you 'll be able to get onto the island to say Mass tonight or tomorrow\n<$L> Uhm well it 's looking like that I won't be there at all this evening so, hopefully maybe by tomorrow sometime, that I 'll be able to get back on the island for Mass That 's one of the the drawbacks\n<$G> Yeah, Today 's airlift operation took place against a background of growing optimism that years of winter isolation for the islands may be about to end Aer Arann which provides a service to the islands off the Galway coast says it 's now seriously examining the possibility of extending this to the Mayo islands\n<$A> And now with news of sport, Anne Cassin\n<$M> Thanks Michael and we start with soccer and Blackburn Rovers moved further ahead in the English premiership today following a one nil win at Crystal Palace Manchester United in second place and now three points behind Rovers after struggling for their two two draw at Southampton And Liverpool kept the pressure on the top two with a two nil win away to Leeds\n<$N> Liverpool hadn't won a premiership game at Elland Road until today, though it turned out to be Leeds who made most of the running throughout the game, like this solo effort by Ireland 's Gary Kelly, But it was South Africa 's Phil Masinga who tormented the Liverpool defence in general and his marker Republic of Ireland back Phil Babb in particular So Liverpool 's first goal was somewhat against the run of play Weatherall 's foul on Rushe produced a Jamie Rednap free kick which led to the youngster 's first goal of the season And despite <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> 's acrobatics it was definitely in the net Leeds fought back in the second half but never really seemed to threaten Liverpool The fight was knocked out of the home team when Liverpool struck again fourteen minutes from full time Weatherall made a gift of this attempted backheader to Robbie Fowler who claimed his twentieth goal of the season\n<$M> And here 's a rundown of the English league soccer matches played today in the premier division Arsenal one Queen 's Park Rangers three, Chelsea one Wimbledon one, Coventry nil Tottenham Hotspur four, Crystal Palace nil Blackburn Rovers one, Everton four Ipswich one, Leeds United nil Liverpool two, Leicester nil Sheffield Wednesday one, Aston Villa two Manchester City two, Norwich two Newcastle one, Southampton two Manchester United two and Westham three Nottingham Forrest one At home in the

international cross country race today when she finished second to Rose Cheriot of Kenya Sonia O'Sullivan also finished out of the placing by coming in fourth behind Britain 's Paula Radcliffe\n<$O> Hopes had been high at the outset of the race that the battle for pre-eminence would be fought between Ireland 's two European champions But an early lead from the World Junior silver medallist Rose Cheriot put her in an unassailable position turning the focus of the event on the race for second place between Caitriona McKiernan and Paula Radcliffe of Britain Away from the familiarity of the track the rough underfoot conditions seemed to create problems for Sonia O 'Sullivan and she lost ground early on falling back to fourth place In the last lap Caitriona McKiernan took second place from Paula Radcliffe and crossed the line some twenty-seven seconds behind the Kenyan Radcliffe was third and Sonia O'Sullivan finished fourth\n<$M> In racing today 's meeting at Punchestown was called off but the management are hoping to reschedule the meeting for tomorrow subject to an eight a-m inspection The big race across the water was the Welsh Grand National won by Master Oats and ridden by Irish jockey Norman Williamson The race should have run at Chepstow last Tuesday but waterlogging on the course forced a changed of schedule to Berkshire Lord Relic joint favourite with Master Oats broke down badly on his near four after jumping the eighth while Chatam fell at the second last Relishing the heavy ground Master Oats sauntered to success  Earth Summit was second twenty lengths behind Master Oats with Party Politics finishing third And that 's the sport this New Year 's Eve Michael\n<$A> The main news again this evening Russia says its troops have taken control of

Employment Up to an additional four thousand health workers are expected to support the strike action today The talks at the  Employer Labour Conference ended without agreement this morning following thirteen hours of discussions Sean Whelan reports\n<$C> The Employer Labour Conference was convened in a last-ditch effort to resolve the dispute, but shortly after five o'clock this morning after thirteen hours of talks the Joint Chairman of the Conference Steering Committee Peter Cassells emerged to say that the Conference was unable to find a basis for resolving the dispute, And he said the Conference had no plans to meet again, Later the joint General Secretary of IMPACT Phil Flynn said the two sides had to continue talking\n<$D> We 've been up there and we 've been, at it for was it fourteen hours fifteen hours and we 've been over the fences and we 've been at it up and down and, sideways and every way, but we just haven't found a solution, And we 'll have to, come at it again uhm uh, you know, as soon as we can\n<$C> Union officials are due to meet later this morning to plan their next moves but the union 's National Secretary Peter McCloon said the escalation of the dispute would go ahead as planned That means another four thousand health workers are expected to join the picket lines later this morning\n<$B> Family doctors are to withdraw from the Department of Health 's Vaccination programme from next January The decision was made last night at a meeting of the General Practitioners Committee of the Irish Medical Organisation In a statement the Committee 's Chairperson Dr Henry Finnegan said the current programme was completely inadequate and resulted in a very poor uptake particularly in deprived urban areas Dr Finnegan said the IMO would be recommending that its members withdraw from the programme until the government introduces a more comprehensive scheme Among the services affected will be the mumps measles and rubella vaccine for children, The Industrial Development Authority has confirmed that a United States company has promised to set up a manufacturing base in Galway and to create more than six hundred jobs in the long term The Boston-based American Power Corporation plans to take over most of the Galway Digital plant and to begin hiring staff within a week From Boston our political correspondent Una Claffey\n<$E> This project had been announced some months ago but was not confirmed until last night The wholly-owned US company will take over two thirds of the Digital plant in Galway It will employ one hundred people before the end of this year IDA Chief Ciaran McGowan confirmed in Boston that the company expects to employ six hundred and eleven people within five years, a number of them former Digital workers, and will manufacture uninterruptible power supply for computers It will also have a research and development division The company which is number forty-three in Fortune Magazine 's One Hundred List of fastest growing US companies made the decision to locate in Ireland because of the skilled labour pool available in Galway, available grants and a taxation rate of ten percent The next lowest taxation rate according to Mr McGowan is that in Britain which is thirty-five percent Una Claffey RTE/ News Boston\n<$B> In the North a seven year old boy called for an ambulance last night

Michael Fisher of our northern staff\n<$H> Mr McGovern, a haulier, was called from his bungalow at Stoneyford Road when a tipper truck arrived around half past eight last night But that vehicle along with a car had been hijacked earlier by gunmen in West Belfast in an attempt to lure him outside A neighbour who is the wife of a DUP councillor heard at least five shots being fired and went to assist Mr McGovern 's four children including an eighteen month old baby girl The eldest boy aged seven had already telephoned an ambulance Mrs McGovern had been away at work at the time The IRA alleged Mr McGovern carried out work for the security forces In the past eight years, more than twenty civilians have been killed in such circumstances But the Mayor of Lisburn, Seamus Close, said there were no legitimate targets and said it was a brutal murder carried out by agents of the devil Michael Fisher, RTE/ news Belfast\n<$B> Gardai/ in Cork say they 're investigating a shooting last night in which a member of the travelling community was wounded The incident happened shortly after ten o'clock at a halting site in the Blackpool area of the city Gardai/ say it appears three or four shots were fired at a group of Travellers who were sitting around a campfire The injured man is said to be in a stable condition in hospital At the start of her official tour of New Zealand President Robinson has defended her controversial handshake with the Sinn Fe/in leader Gerry Adams From Wellington Cathy Halloran reports\n<$F> In an interview with New Zealand television 's prime time current affairs show President Robinson said it was very important that she reached out to the Catholic community in West Belfast, who she said felt very isolated She said her gesture was very important because she was viewed by this community as leaning towards the Unionist population She said she was not in the business of endorsing anybody politically but it was important to balance what she did by reaching out to those on the ground who are developing the structures of a humane society There 's been a huge media interest in the President 's visit here An editorial in the New Zealand Herald took up the symbolism of her visit to Belfast The leader writer suggested that if Israel and the PLO can come together at the same table then President Robinson might be the woman to bring the Ulster Unionists and the IRA at least to a talking point Cathy Halloran RTE/ News Wellington New Zealand\n<$B> Three armed Islamic militants who hijacked a Russian airliner and forced it to fly to Norway have surrendered after freeing all their fifty hostages at an airport near Oslo The three believed to be of Iranian origin were taken into police custody following five hours of negotiations A

Highest temperatures thirteen to sixteen degrees That 's the news and weather The time is seven minutes past eight And here with what it says in the papers is Kevin O'Connor\n<$G> It 's a morning of contrast and contradictions in the news and the bad prognosis in the health dispute, becomes the common lead in the Independent Times and Cork Examiner, with various prescriptions on offer from the editorial writers All the papers agree that as the Independent puts it the strike is set to cripple hospital services Some even predict terminal cases Inside in the Independent health correspondent Eilis O'Regan says it 's literally a matter of life and death The hospital chaos illustrates just how fragile is the industry that deals with life and death and what a powerful weapon the union has on its side She reports that the emergency cover being provided by some striking workers is wholly inadequate The most vulnerable are suffering most writes O'Regan Alongside that The Independent has a long editorial setting out the parameters of the dispute and concluding, that the consequences are likely to be out of all proportion to the causes The public will feel that government and unions have clashed without sufficient cause, says The Independent Causes and consequences come in for comment and reportage in other areas this morning particularly, on the Northern Ireland and the Labour front with jobs the predominant concern among most papers  good and bad news on jobs front , is how The Examiner heads its editorial comments saying that the good news is that Cork and Galway are to get a boost in employment, but that 's offset by other depressing job losses referring to the redundancies in De Beers at Shannon and Donnelly Mirrors in Kildare The Times news headings tell a similar story  US firms to create hundreds of jobs at Digital plant  says one heading, and beside that another heading says  firms announce a hundred and sixty-five job losses  Underneath that the paper reports the murder by the IRA of the Catholic haulier in Lisburn in front of his children which both Press and Independent describe as being hysterical in the wake of the killing By contrast The Press has a moving picture and account of the death of Caoilfhionn McDonald who lived for one year and nine months with a severe stomach complaint, and finally died in a Belfast hospital after the failure, to find a transplant donor On other pages this morning there 's much on final fever that 's the football clash as the papers like to call it between teams from opposite ends of the island Derry and Cork There 's much on autumn fashions from Brown Thomas which writer Vivienne Clarke in The Press says requires, not only a sylphlike figure but a bank balance of Rubenesque proportions Surely a collision of opposing forces there And finally this morning there 's a judicious piece of court reporting in The Independent It concerns a case in which British rider Harvey Smith was involved in in a dispute over alleged damage to his land by greenkeepers from a nearby golf course One   greenkeeper said that Harvey Smith advanced towards him, as he stepped forward he hit me on the left-hand side of my face turning me round He hit me on my cheek with his fist It was not necessarily hard but enough for me to be facing in the opposite direction\n<$A> Kevin O'Connor It 's ten past eight It now seems certain the dental assistants ' dispute is going to escalate further All-night talks at a meeting of the Employer Labour Conference, failed to come up with a formula to resolve the dispute Now some four thousand members of the IMPACT Union in clerical administrative and paramedical grades in the eight regional Health Boards look set to join three thousand of their colleagues on the picket lines this morning The union seeking the payment of a ten percent pay award for three hundred and fifty dental assistants That award was made almost two years ago The payment has been deferred because the government fears it 'd have a knock-on effect for other public  sector pay claims Where does the matter go from here Sean Whelan put that question to IMPACT joint General Secretary Philip Flynn as he left the Department of Employment just before six o'clock this morning", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "17c3dd4c-71f8-47c4-af8d-dcd4e06d670a", "added":

reacted strongly this morning to plans to cover Ireland in a grand afforestation plan, taking in a massive three hundred and seventy thousand acres ICMSA National Council member Vincent Crowley said that such a plan could accelerate rural decline stating that existing farms could become more isolated by being hemmed in by trees and that trees did not spend money but farmers did The new and controversial Public Order Bill has come under yet more criticism, this time from an anti-abortion group, Youth Defence, who say they are now afraid to distribute leaflets on Cork streets because they are constantly being moved on in Dublin The group said that Ireland would be heading towards a police state if members of the public cannot express their views The arrest of a member of their organisation recently caused civil liberty groups to decry the Public Order Bill as infringing on the rights of expression of ordinary citizens And now for national and international news The Justice

Selectors Jim Ryan\n<$G> Well I would think that any game has to be taken on the day or on the night The weather is going to have a big influence on  tonight obviously I would honestly say, yes we have as good a chance We should have stopped them last year We were uh held to a draw in the original final when we had a winning from a forty yards free in the last minute and didn't take it And put up a good display in the final We were quite happy with  result and we have been improving throughout the year Uh I would say yes\n<$F> I 'd imagine you would have a fair idea uh of talking to lads at

conditions in the market we wouldn't anticipate any great difficulties in them doing that\n<$F> Now it has been suggested that there isn't much of an appetite for conglomerates in the market at present\n<$G> Uhm on balance that 's probably correct uh uhm but it 's more to do really with the problems experienced by some of the conglomerates in Ireland uhm through the recession In particular both James Crean and Fitzwilton encountered difficulties Uhm however DCC itself has managed itself uh very well during the recession uh through over the last few years uh and we would we would expect uhm you know that the uh track record will will will speak for itself\n<$F> But should DCC then be more focused ie should they be involved in less companies\n<$H> Probably uh over time, but  at the moment they are themselves developing uhm they are attempting to to streamline streamline the uh operating structure that they have in operation at the moment Uhm they 're however still an unusual

Elan\n<$H> Uhm yes the the the revenues and net income has been growing uh over the past five to seven years uhm  due to the fact of the change of strategy to mind to market Uh this is where Elan takes the product uh through all stages uh of the development and regulatory phases and then licence the product out Uhm the growth from the the uh revenues over the past few years and going into the future is coming from our  main products such as our once daily <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> uh and our nicotine patch, our <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> product, our uhm <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> product and the launch of these in additional countries Today Elan 's products are sold in forty-four countries throughout the world\n<$F> Now there are fifty-five products under development at the

uh what sort of,   any examples of those\n<$H> Uh an example of those would be our uh Naproxen product uh our <unclear> 3 sylls </unclear> product uh and uhm some antibiotic products that we 're

governments and uh generic uh  competitors Uhm will you not be affected in the same way\n<$H> Well actually one of the the the benefits of the the type of of uh business that we 're in is that uh with drug delivery we 're actually providing uhm better therapeutic benefit uh for the patient so that in fact what we 're looking at is a more cost-effective type of treatment uhm because if you 've got a patient getting uh more out of their drug getting better absorption, by  by getting maintenance of the uh drug in the system   at complete levels over twenty-four hour periods uhm that patient is going to get better quicker uhm and therefore you 're going to have a reduced cost\n<$F> Glencar Explorations say they 've received positive results from test drilling on its Wassa property in the

correspondent Michael Ronayne\n<$C> On the day that Bank of Ireland announced a doubling of profits to two hundred and eighty million pounds, the Taoiseach has launched a broadside at the banks He said he accepted that banks needed satisfactory profit margins But he said people had to ask the question whether larger bank profits were made at the expense of jobs Mr Reynolds said the gap between what the banks pay to depositors and what they charge many borrowers had grown since nineteen seventy-nine to the detriment of both The community deserved an explanation he said, as to why the gap between the interest on large demand deposits and the interest paid on loans of working capital for small businesses or farmers, had widened from a mere two and three quarters percent in nineteen seventy-nine to ten and three quarters percent today Mr Reynolds complained of the main banks consistently dragging their heels when it came to lowering interest rates He asked if this was because it

unemployment figures the plight of the long-term unemployed is frightening and can only be addressed in this way he said With a rising economy, Mr Flynn 's comments will certainly open a whole new

Dutch Agriculture Minister on behalf of Goodman International He said the World in Action programme had effectively implied he 'd asked the Minister to intervene with Goodman 's Dutch bankers Mr McSharry said the programme makers had carefully edited what he 'd said, and deliberately left out a key sentence from the footage used This sentence stated he didn't even know who the company 's bankers were at the time Mr McSharry 's speech was read out in full to the Tribunal, and compared against the piece used by the World in Action team to show what Mr McSharry called the false impression created by the programme Lorraine Smith RTE/ news Dublin Castle,\n<$B> There are strong indications that the British Government is preparing to back away from its controversial decision to close down more than half the country 's coal mines within the next five months After a two and a half hour cabinet meeting this morning a Downing Street spokesman quoted the Prime Minister Mr Major as admitting that his government had underestimated the shock that the decision had caused Mr Major has been facing a rebellion by conservative backbenchers on the closures, which would 've led to the loss of thirty thousand jobs It 's now expected that there 'll be a softening of the proposals when the Trade Secretary Mr Michael Heseltine makes a Commons statement on the Government 's latest position this afternoon Our London correspondent Brian O'Connell\n<$D> The cabinet gathered at Downing Street as John Major faced the most crucial test of his premiership It was revealed this morning that a crisis meeting of senior ministers was held last night to consider the options in the pit closure programme Michael Heseltine the Trade Secretary is directly in the firing line He 's due to make a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon But Downing Street sources have been signalling some softening of the government 's position It 's widely believed that the government Chief Whip Richard Ryder has warned the cabinet this morning that the tide of Tory backbench revolt cannot now be contained to ensure government victory in the Commons following next Wednesday 's debate Backbench Tory dissent has been growing over the weekend The number of MPs expected to vote against the government on Wednesday is now estimated in double figures That 's enough to wipe out the government 's twenty-one seat majority Brian O'Connell RTE/ news Westminster\n<$B> Sterling has continued to fall on the foreign exchange markets The Irish pound is now trading at around one pound and nine pence sterling, a gain of nearly two pence since Friday 's close The political turmoil created by the proposal to close the coal mines has undermined the currency In addition last week 's

a new low this week, In Luxemburg EC Finance Ministers have begun their discussions on the new funding earmarked for poorer countries once the Maastricht Treaty is ratified The Minister for Finance Mr Ahern said this morning he will argue that there can be no drawing back from the commitments made to less well-off member states including Ireland, despite the economic recession Our European correspondent Tommy Gorman reports\n<$E> The meeting had a late defection Britain 's Norman Lamont has more pressing business at home so Paymaster General Sir John Cope is deputising as Chairman It 's an important day for the four poorer countries, Greece Portugal Ireland and Spain The key item on the agenda is the special cohesion fund to be established as part of the Maastricht Treaty, to help compensate for the negative effects of economic and monetary union That fund is expected to come to eight billion pounds and will be confined to countries whose wealth is less than ninety percent of the EC average Ireland is laying claim on one eighth of the total one billion pounds, although it has less than one twentieth of the combined population of the four countries Today those four poorer member states will seek to ensure that despite the economic climate the commitment of their richer neighbours won't waver They 're also anxious to ensure that Britain with its growing unemployment problems doesn't attempt to gain a share of the aid Finance Minister Bertie Ahern said he 'll be pushing to get indications from the richer countries, that they will honour their pledges Tommy Gorman

Dr Sean O'Laoire was set up by the Minister for Health Dr O'Connell in July Here 's Derek Cunningham\n<$F> The the ministerial inquiry into the behaviour of Mr O'Laoire was sought by Beaumont Hospital after an internal investigation The hospital 's two-year dispute with Mr O'Laoire culminated with his suspension from duty last April At the inquiry set up in July Beaumont Hospital and the majority of consultants in the Neuroscience department, claimed that Mr O'Laoire had mounted a campaign to damage the hospital They claimed he had undermined the morale of medical staff at the hospital by making allegations about poor standards of patient care Mr O'Laoire has always contended that his concern has been to improve standards at Beaumont, and that he was compelled to speak out when he believed that those standards had fallen below an acceptable level In its report today the Committee of Inquiry found Mr O'Laoire 's misconduct was such that his appointment should be terminated The Minister for Health Dr O'Connell will now decide if appealed to by Mr O'Laoire whether to accept the inquiry 's recommendations If the findings are accepted Mr O'Laoire will be the third member of the Beaumont Neurosurgical Unit to have been removed since nineteen eighty-nine,\n<$B> A Garda accused of assaulting and robbing a prostitute has lost a High Court bid to prevent the Garda Commissioner

Wood\n<$G> Thirty year old Garda O'Shea was on duty in Donnybrook Garda Station on April the fourteenth this year when he was called in by Detective Inspector Liam Coen Inspector Coen said Garda O'Shea 's car had been seen the previous night in Wilton Place and a prostitute had alleged he 'd assaulted her with a baton and robbed her During a five-hour interview Garda O'Shea strenuously denied the allegations Inspector Coen said the Garda had a drink problem and Garda O'Shea agreed to be admitted to the Saint John of God 's Clinic in Stillorgan where he stayed for five weeks While in the clinic Garda O'Shea was suspended on two thirds salary and last week he was informed he was being dismissed with effect from today Garda O'Shea said he wanted to see the evidence on which the charges against him were based, and in the meantime he asked the court to prevent his dismissal Mr Justice Morris refused but gave Garda O'Shea permission to apply to have the decision reviewed\n<$B> Cardinal Cahal Daly has said the primary consideration in the green paper on education should be that schools will continue to be denominational and acceptable to the churches He warned that any review of the current system must be careful not to damage the values that are already in place The Cardinal made his comments in the current issue of the VEC 's Decision Maker magazine On integrated schooling in the north the Cardinal said there has to be flexibility and respect for different options He also questioned the success of integrated education policies, There 's been an arms and explosives find at

Washington are behaving like it 's the last hours on the Titanic with Bill Clinton set to win the White House A call for the Irish Government to step up its economic lobbying in the United States, despite the recession there and the British government 's crisis over coal  At the Beef Inquiry as you 've heard EC Commissioner Ray McSharry said the World in Action programme which led to the setting up of the tribunal had deliberately distorted a statement he made in the European Parliament Mr McSharry also again denied asking a Dutch minister to intervene with bankers on behalf of Goodman International I 'm joined now from the Tribunal by commentator John Cooney John first of all could you set the scene for us Uh what impact did Ray McSharry make there today after Charles Haughey last week What was the atmosphere like\n\n<$A> Well as you 've heard the report of the Committee of Inquiry appointed by the Minister for Health to consider the conduct of the consultant neurosurgeon at Beaumont Hospital Mr Sean O'Laoire has been published this morning The inquiry recommends that Mr O'Laoire should be dismissed And I 'm joined on the phone by the legal affairs correspondent uh of The Irish  Irish Independent I 'm sorry, Brian Dowling Brian Dowling this uh, uh report will be on John O'Connell 's desk Uh  it 's going to be a thorny one for him to deal with isn't it\n<$H> It is yes It 's going to be a particularly difficult one for him to deal with Doctor O'Connell would 've been seen in the early stages as uhm, sympathetic to him perhaps even a supporter of Mr O'Laoire And he was somewhat reluctant earlier this year to set up this inquiry when it was requested by Beaumont Hospital But he did accede to the request and the inquiry began in July But he is now faced with the position where the inquiry which he himself established has now unanimously recommended that Mr O'Laoire 's employment be terminated at Beaumont\n<$A> And uh what exactly were the, the complaints which were uh inquired into uh uh by this uh inquiry and uh  were there any detailed conclusions that we 're aware of  on the complaints\n<$H> Well the complaints I think would be probably be divided into two main categories There were a number of complaints in relation to the manner in which he dealt with his fellow nursing and medical colleagues and the, hospital had alleged that he had on several occasions sought to blame them for errors or for the outcome in particular cases And running parallel with that the committee went into some detail in examining a number of individual patient case histories where there were allegations and counter-allegations in relation to the way in which those cases were handled", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL",

it 's a turning point in their relationship with Israel Back home the DUP say they 're  presenting a paper to John Major on restarting the Northern talks process, President Clinton opened the ceremony on the White House lawns He told the gathered audience of three thousand people that both sides had pledged to work together President Clinton praised the courage of both sides in taking the gigantic step\n\n<$A> The Israeli Prime Minister Mr Yitzhak Rabin a former soldier said enough blood had been spilled in the conflict He said it was also a difficult day for him but it was a time to end ancient hostilities\n\n<$A> And the PLO Leader Yasser Arafat said today 's decision took great and exceptional courage\n\n\n<$A> Back home now and Dr Ian Paisley 's DUP is to present John Major, with a paper setting out the party 's proposals for reviving political talks in the North, although it 's not clear if their plan would provide for Irish government involvement The move has been welcomed by the Northern Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew who is himself putting the finishing touches to a document aimed at giving direction to any reconvened talks Our northern editor David Davin-Power\n<$B> Of all the North 's parties the DUP is the most firmly opposed to Dublin being involved in any reconvened talks in advance of any declaration on Articles two and three And it 's not thought likely that there 'll be any relaxation of that stance Instead the document entitled, Breaking the Logjam, and running to some twenty pages will propose modifications to the three-strand scheme put in place by Peter Brooke and to which both governments remain committed The party 's Deputy Leader Peter Robinson wouldn't say whether the Irish government could be involved in talks under their proposals\n<$C> We 're not saying what 's in our our documentation until we meet the Prime Minister and hand over that document to him Uh but it 's uh a document which clearly in its analysis would recognise where the stumbling blocks and obstacles have been in the past process, why we feel a continuation on the same failed process cannot succeed, and therefore in the light of that what alternatives uh are available to us Uh and it uh outlines several alternative uh ways forward\n<$B> Sir Patrick Mayhew who 's putting the finishing touches to his own document aimed at giving direction to any reconvened talks welcomed the news of the DUP proposal\n<$D>  I 'm concerned only to secure what the vast majority of the everyday people of Northern Ireland want, namely to see the politicians talking So I 'm very interested to see whatever proposals any party leader may have \n<$B> The DUP paper won't increase the likelihood of dialogue recommencing but it indicates that the party is still interested in involving itself in the process The Irish government will be more interested in the tone of the British document The Northern Ireland Office denied today that this would contain specific proposals but said it would instead provide a summary of the current political position David Davin-Power, RTE/ news, Belfast\n<$A> The Northern Ireland Tourist Board has warned that thousands of jobs in the hotel

Brendan Wright reports\n<$E> Having been thwarted last month when a huge car bomb was defused outside the Stormont Hotel in east Belfast the IRA returned to their target early today and this time they succeeded in causing extensive damage with a device containing about three hundred pounds of homemade explosive, The recently refurbished hotel lost all its windows but was back in business by lunchtime Homes in the surrounding residential areas were also affected and three people were slightly hurt In recent months the IRA has targeted some of the best-known hotels in the North including the Mourne Country in Newry and the Europa and the Drumkeen in Belfast The Drumkeen is still closed and under repair Officials at the Northern Ireland Tourist Board are gravely concerned and say many of the jobs in the hotel and catering industry could now be at risk Neville Morrison who 's the chief executive of the Northern Ireland Hotels and Caterers Association also agrees\n\n<$E> Brendan Wright RTE/ News Belfast\n<$A> Dublin County Council has called on the government to set up a sworn public inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in nineteen seventy-four A resolution calling for the inquiry to be presided over by a member of the judiciary was agreed this afternoon The resolution calls for the investigation of the alleged failure of Gardai/ to bring those responsible to justice, the alleged non co-operation of the RUC in the Garda investigation and the   alleged assistance given to the personnel involved in the atrocity by British intelligence services The Council wants the inquiry set up so that relatives of the people who died or were injured in the bombings may know the identity of those responsible Coming up next EC Finance Ministers foresee that the

revolution The PLO said today was a turning point in their relationship with Israel And the DUP say they 're presenting a paper to John Major on restarting the Northern talks process In Brussels EC finance ministers have accepted that the European exchange rate mechanism will operate with wide fluctuating margins for the foreseeable future They decided to press ahead with the timetable for monetary union by agreeing to set up a European Monetary Institute from the beginning of next year The Minister for Finance said afterwards the government will continue to pursue policies which promote low inflation and interest rates Our European correspondent Tommy Gorman\n<$F> Today 's meeting of EC finance ministers attracted considerable media attention It 's six weeks since they were forced to radically overhaul the ERM Today the ministers accepted the plan to return from the wider fluctuation margins to the narrow band system by January the first, is no longer practical\n<$G> Uh the new system is a flexible system We need time, uh to address just precisely how we can improve the ERM Uh there 's no point in going back to the way we were prior to the second of August and the view is we need to reflect now, and put our own houses in order\n<$F> During a televised session the ministers spelt out how the credibility of the exchange rate mechanism, and the dream of a single currency could be renewed There was a general acceptance the markets had been right Too many disparate economies had been rushing headlong towards economic and monetary union Each member state committed itself to low interest low inflation and good housekeeping policies The nineteen ninety-seven target date for a single currency is considered over-ambitious The Irish government will continue with its economic policies\n<$G> I think uh   if if we can achieve more growth uh from the national plan uh and have stability uh have uh both price stability and exchange rate stability uh

fourth which we all clearly understood allowed for uh this outstanding issue on DSAs to be settled Uh but it hasn't happened and that 's why the uh the union and the DSAs were left with no option but

the unions are insisting on an upfront commitment to pay it We cannot do that no strings attached We have to get agreement from the unions to offsetting efficiency measures and that has been one of the stumbling blocks But as I 've said, there is not a dispute as to whether this award should be paid it 's a question of how\n<$H> Three thousand workers go on strike tomorrow, a further three

paratroopers are expected to be charged today in connection with a number of incidents in Coalisland in County Tyrone last May With the details, Emer O'Kelly\n<$B> The American Secretary of State Mr Laurence Eagleburger and the Russian Foreign Minister Mr Andre Kozyrev have agreed the text of a treaty to reduce substantially their arsenals of nuclear weapons The agreement announced in Geneva is to be submitted to President Bush and President Yeltsin for their approval, The treaty known as START Two would reduce US and Russian nuclear arsenals by about two thirds The treaty would also abolish the most dangerous category of weapon which is the land-based missile with multiple warheads Agreement on the text emerged during the second day of talks between the Foreign Ministers in what has been described as the final attempt by the Bush administration to complete the treaty before they leave office on January the twentieth The announcement was made by Mr Eagleburger\n\n<$B> Reports of a massacre in Somalia early this month have been confirmed by western diplomats in the capital Mogadishu Up to two hundred people are said to have been killed by a rival clan in the port city of Kismayo, on the eve of the arrival of American troops in the country And there are reports this morning that gunmen in Mogadishu killed five Somalis working for international relief agencies in two attacks Aid officials said the killings yesterday and other shootings pointed to mounting tension in the capital before President Bush 's New Year visit to US troops later this week The gun attacks happened only hours after the mass peace rally in Mogadishu led by the leaders of the city 's two main warring factions Four Somalis were killed when gunmen sprayed bullets into a bus collecting staff hired locally, by the International Committee of the Red Cross And a Somali working for the international agency CARE died when a car in which he was travelling was hijacked, The United States has accused Baghdad of a further violation of the air exclusion zone over southern Iraq A US military spokesman said Iraqi jets again flew into the zone yesterday but left without any shots being fired The violation occurred within twenty-four hours of the confrontation at the weekend in which an American fighter plane shot down an Iraqi jet The US aircraft carrier Kittyhawk with eighty planes on board has been dispatched from the Somali coast to the Gulf region, An attempt by Israel to defuse the crisis over the expelled four hundred and fifteen Palestinians has been rejected by Lebanon Israel offered to allow a Red Cross medical team to visit the deportees if Lebanon agreed to let through deliveries of food and water But the Lebanese government argued that the group of Palestinians stranded in a no-man 's-land were in Israeli occupied territory and Israel should provide them with food and medical supplies Official sources said President Hrawi told the UN envoy Mr James Jonah, that Lebanon was adamant that he couldn't pass through Lebanese lines to visit the deportees Mr Jonah had travelled from Israel, to Beirut, In Brazil Mr Fernando Collor has resigned as President His

most areas highest temperatures between three and eight degrees Remaining dry after dark with sharp ground frost developing where skies are clear That 's it from me Michael\n<$A> Thank-you Emer And later in the programme the formation of a new government We ask who might be in and who might be out in a Labour Fianna Fa/il coalition From Israel the latest on the stalemate over the  over the Palestinians in no man 's land, Somalia, as some gunmen return to the streets of Mogadishu we hear from an aid worker on the increasing tension in the city And in our schools why one economist believes that religion is losing out to the point system Join us after the break\n\n<$A> Well back home again, the moves to form the next government are continuing today with the Labour Party negotiators consulting with their economic advisors Tomorrow it 's face-to-face talks with Fianna Fa/il again I 'm now joined by Stephen Collins political correspondent of the Sunday Press Stephen how close are we to agreement at this stage\n<$C> Well I think we 're fairly close to agreement I think a lot of talking still has to be done but I think there are basic agreement on principles anyway And it 's a question of getting detailed work done uh this week on the budget Next January 's budget is going to be a very difficult one to sort out And the whole figures for nineteen ninety-three are not very good So Labour and Fianna Fa/il are going to have to talk through the  all the budgetary situation and then talk maybe about budgetary policy into the future But once that is done I think then we 'll see a deed being wrapped up early next week or in the middle of next week\n<$A> Over recent days there has been much speculation about the position of Foreign Minister David Andrews Is it on the cards that Labour will squeeze him out in favour maybe even of Dick Spring\n<$C> I think certainly Labour will be looking for a number of senior ministries I think in their earlier talks with Fine Gael and the PDs Labour were insisting on getting a Taoiseach 's job in in rotating around Uh with Fianna Fa/il I think they 've dropped the demand to be Taoiseach but I think they 're going to insist on getting some of the top portfolios in government So I think uh the the impression now is that Labour will not be pressing for uh the Finance for the Department of Finance uh on the basis that a lot of top decisions have to be taken there and Fianna Fa/il want to hold on to that So they 'll want to get other senior ministries instead and Foreign Affairs is one of the ones they 've targeted I think Labour certainly are saying they 'll want, an a major economic ministry and  there 's going to be new Department of Employment and Enterprise come out of these talks I think Labour will want that Uh they 'll probably want to get the Environment as well, and maybe Dick Spring then maybe Foreign Affairs or Justice I 'm I think it 's not all signed or sealed on that level   yet but <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> \n<$A>  But if they did get   Foreign Affairs what would be the reaction of Fianna Fa/il What would be the reaction of either of David Andrews himself to that\n<$C> Well I think at the end of the day David Andrews like any other politician will accept uh  the  choices made by his own leader He will serve in government I think wherever uh his Taoiseach decides to, send him Naturally I  he would like to stay on in Foreign Affairs He has uh a very high public profile He 's got a lot of plaudits for the work he 's done there And it would be quite understandable that he 'd want to remain in Foreign Affairs And I think both Mr Andrews and Fianna Fa/il will try and and hold on to the post However I think at the end of the day, it 's going to come down to a decision between Albert Reynolds and Dick Spring Uh the issue of posts is not part of the negotiations between the two sets of negotiating teams Uh they they 're a matter for uh Albert Reynolds and Dick Spring They 've had some informal discussions about the I the the posts and where they might go but nothing has been uh announced yet   And I think it \n<$A>  So what about   the other traditional non-Labour portfolios Justice and Agriculture\n<$C> Yeah well I don't think Agriculture would really uh  will go to Labour I don't think Fianna Fa/il would be willing to concede Agriculture to Labour and I don't think it 'd be one of Labour 's priorities Uhm I think if Labour if they got the  uh the Department of Employment if the Environment was also available and if they got Justice or Foreign Affairs I 'm not sure that they will get both They would look for one or the other I think Agriculture will be left to Fianna Fa/il Uhm  Fianna Fa/il is  the farmers uh  party which farmers vote for in in big numbers Labour would be a party who who wouldn't have the confidence of great great  many farmers in the country\n<$A> So to continue with the speculation at this stage on the Fianna Fa/il side, who are the likely casualties,\n<$C> Well the Albert Reynolds does have the advantage that he has four positions vacant because the two PDs left government, and he 's got Padraig Flynn going to the EC Commission Uh so he who 's going to be dropped, Uh, most of the speculation centres around John O'Connell, uhm, who indicated a certain amount of frustration with his role in the Department of Health and frustration with the way the Department of Finance treated the  the other departments in his post-election comments And then it 'd be it it seems to be a toss up but uh Seamus Brennan or Michael Woods are the names most often mentioned the two Dublin Ministers Uh, Fianna Fa/il wouldn't want to run down the number of ministers in Dublin too much but they have other uh  other ministers in the city and neither of those two would be particularly close to Albert Reynolds So I  think they 'll they 're the possible casualties\n<$A> And on the Labour side who might be getting the Mercs",

{"text": "<Storytelling>\n\n\n<$A> I 'm Liz Weir, and over the next few weeks it will be my pleasure to introduce stories and storytellers from far and wide Some of the tales to be told have been around for hundreds of years, while others have modern settings And they come not just from Ireland but are from many countries In times past families frequently gathered to listen to stories together, with children and adults sharing the same tales The advent of electricity was said to have led to a decline in the tradition, as it was no longer necessary to tell stories to keep the darkness away And yet the art of the storyteller is perhaps more important than ever in today 's fast-moving world Over the next few weeks, I hope that by listening to the stories, and seeing those all-important pictures in the mind 's eye, you will have the chance to relax, and reflect on times past, maybe even to call to mind stories of your own The subject of today 's programme is religion, since of all the stories told at local gatherings this is the most frequently heard theme It is ironic that whenever visitors come to Northern Ireland they assume that any mention of religion is taboo, and yet they are soon amazed by the fact that the locals make jokes and tell stories on this very subject Perhaps by laughing at ourselves and our prejudices, some of the tension can be released And yet not all of today 's stories are humorous, nor do they assume that there are only two religions in the world Stories whether they are in the form of a monologue, family history or folktale, cross all sorts of boundaries, and can perhaps lead to more understanding of other people 's lives The late James Young wrote many popular pieces on the Protestant Catholic divide, a tradition carried on in recent years by local writers such as Crawford Howard, who always says that he manages to offend both sides in the one night It is certainly true that people in this part of the world take their religion very seriously But in our first story, written and told by Billy Ritchie we take a look at a day out with a difference\n<$B>  The pilgrimage coach came to lift us, to take us away down to Thurles And big Mary Rose from the Springfield was right proud of her hair set in curls Well we crowded round, some clutching liquor, especially bought for the trip, with most bottles already sampled by considerably more than a sip In the midst of us there were two strangers, who no-one had seen there before, and nobody asked for their tickets, as we all scrambled in through the door They just seemed to flop on the back seat, and soon the coach got underway But we gathered, although they were tipsy, that their first names were Lily and May They just sat and tippled their whiskey and to tell you the truth so did I By the time we were crossing the border, a few of the travellers were high Then some of us started off singing, though Lily and May didn't join, but they let out a gulder up Billy, just as we crossed over the Boyne Soon after we pulled into Dublin a break pre-arranged to have lunch Well Lil and May staggered off gaily, and got off with the rest of the bunch Well we straightened up as we assembled though Lil and May cared not the least, and they weren't even slightly embarrassed, when they came face-to-face with a priest Lil says,  hey listen here fella, til I put a word in your ear I think you 'd be better to scarper, for I doubt if you 'll be welcome here Well the wee priest says,  pardon me Madam, on your state I don't wish to encroach but surely you ought to be sober since you 're just off a pilgrimage coach  Pilgrimage what, exclaims Lily, as a good look around her she made This morning we set off for Bangor, to go to an Orange Parade Well, here in amidst the confusion,  what 's all this questions big Mary Rose, still under the effects of the liquor You could tell by the red of her nose  Now calm down says Father John Reilly You ladies just made a mistake Mistake is it bellowed big Rosie She 'll be needing a slap in the beak  Well you big Fenian hussy yells Lily, making to grab Rosie 's throat But wee Father John got between them, which only got on both their goat Well you orange bitch you screams Rosie, ignoring the priest 's warning call, made a charge and they all lost their balance and fell into the Royal Canal That dampened their urge to do battle and hastened an end to their war Rose and Lil had to suffer our laughter while stuck to their oxters in glar And if looks could 've killed, I can tell you, they 'd 've slaughtered the half of the bus But the miracle was, they stopped fighting and directed their venom at us Well we got them fished out and their perfume was Olde Canal Bottom Stink The saga had not helped appearance, but it countered effects of the drink They muttered and cursed as we sniggered and called them a fine matching pair Gone was the makeup from Lily, and the curls had all left Rosie 's hair Now we share then some lunch and refreshments not to mention a quick change of clothes And soon we were ready for leaving It was then that a problem arose We wanted to make up lost time now but uh what about Lily and May We could not leave them stranded in Dublin It was best that they came all the way Of of this they were somewhat reluctant, but against this they balanced their need And not wishing to cause any further delay, they made a snap choice and agreed On arrival at our destination, they came with us both bold as brass, right up to the door of the chapel, but drew lines at attending the Mass And when back on the coach home to Belfast, reflecting the chain of events, Rose and Lil thought the whole thing hilarious, and them from both sides of the fence And Rosie got great friends with Lily and Lily became her best pal, though Lil often said, you 're a Baptist since that episode in the canal And every time Father John Reilly, encounters a coach bound for Thurles, he always remembers the day that, he went for a dip with the girls\n\n<$C> And my father, is from Castlederg as well And we were tracing family history so I went back to my grandmother when she was about ninety Although she was physically frail, mentally she was very alert and very sharp And I was sitting with her one day and my father who was nearly seventy at this stage was sitting beside us, and she started to relate to me the whole Craig family tree And she got onto the point where she was talking about her own husband Patrick Craig, who had a sister called Honour Craig And Honour as a young girl had emigrated and gone to America And in America she 'd married a Jewish man called Mr Simon And Mr Simon and Honour had three boys and the boys were being reared as Catholics at that stage But unfortunately poor Honour and her Jewish husband, became victims of the Great Flu and died So that left three orphans And word came back to Castlederg that the three boys were being reared by the Jewish side of the family My granny was a newly-married young woman and she thought that she should send for these boys So she went to the parish priest and asked his advice, and, should she bring the boys back here and rear them and look after them And he said to her well look Minnie, you might have enough of your own in times to come And she did She had twelve And his second piece of advice was, sure Minnie aren't they better out there being reared as good Jews and they 'll get a job, than being over here as Catholics and might never get work\n\n<$A> That family story from Jim Craig shows how practical people here can be at times Well there are many examples of relatives marrying into a different religion This is sometimes not talked about until someone goes in search of family history, and often people can get a surprise This is the stuff of which good stories are made In almost every culture religious tales make up a sizeable part of any folktale collection, from the dream time in Australia to the native American Indian creation myths Ireland is no exception And while it is certainly a long way from the Glens of Antrim to the Holy Land, this next story was collected in County Antrim by folklorist Michael J Murphy some forty years ago, and it is retold for us now by John Campbell\n<$D> It was, the time of the flight into Egypt when uhm, when the Blessed Virgin and the child Jesus were on the flight into Egypt They hadn't very much time to get away and they were in a great hurry because all the male children were going to be put to death They had to trick soldiers and everything else to get into Egypt and it was a long journey And they ran out of food she ran out of food for the child and she had ran out of food for herself and everything and eventually they come to a house And when they come to the house uh she knocked at the door, and a woman come to the door She discovered, that the woman in the house had a baby, of the same age, as our as the child Jesus So she asked her would she have any food that she could give her some and, feed the baby And she said well I have very little but I 'll give you the half of what I 've got So she took them them in and, gave her the food for the child And as she was feeding the child, uh the Blessed Virgin said to uh the woman in the house, hang that pot on the fire and fill it full of pebbles and put water in it, and put the lid on it And the woman did what she was told Went out and gathered some pebbles and put them into the pot and filled it up with water Eventually the pot started to boil And when it after it boiled for a while she said to uh the woman of the house now lift off the lid to you see what you have And, she lifted off the lid and there it was full of great big floury potatoes broke out ready for, the table So they all sat round and had a great feed of potatoes And when she was draining the water off the potatoes water was very scarce, uh in that country at that time and still is, she said now drain that water into a basin because I want to wash, my baby in that water And she did She washed the infant Jesus in the water and when she was finished she told the woman of the house to wash her baby in the water and she did And years and years passed, thirty-three in fact, and after all that time, the penitent thief that hung beside Jesus on the cross on Calvary, turned out to be that the penitent thief was the same baby that was washed in the same potato water, on that flight into Egypt He 'd given him the strength to repent, and eventually get into heaven", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "67fd8aad-a2b0-4a44-9efc-ad375dbaa519", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.405736+00:00"}

very hard to describe my job because I never really know at times when I go in in the morning what I 'm going to end up doing\n\n<$F> The Women 's Support Network is also something which crosses, the    the two,  major traditional communities here Not only that we 're also trying to uhm reflect and to talk with and to articulate the needs of women who are outside of the two main traditional communities, because one of the the myths about here is that there are only two traditional communities There are other communities here We have a large and growing Asian community We have a travelling community We have a Gaeilgeoiri/ community which is the community of people who speak and use the Irish language We have lesbian women who are marginalised because of their sexuality All of those women have been uhm forgotten about dismissed because they 're not seen as part of the mainstream And it is time now for those women who are actually the majority If all the marginalised groups came together they would be the majority When I say that we cross the the two major traditions, I think it 's very important to also say that in doing that, we don't pretend, that we agree on everything And I don't believe that we will ever agree on say uhm issues of of of national identity, for instance And and what we do have in common as working-class women is a, is an experience of being marginalised and not being seen as important and our voices and our needs being completely dismissed by mainstream politics\n<$B>  I 'm at Strathearn School studying English Literature French and Maths for A-level A girls ' school 's half-way to a nunnery No I don't think I would agree On the contrary I think sometimes a girls ' school can make girls a little bit more wild than if they had been at a mixed school I play for the first eleven hockey in school and also for civil service first eleven outside of school I think in hockey you have to be determined and aggressive and skilful, and those are the sort of qualities that you need when you 're going to have to fight your way in the business world \n\n<$C> Well the Women 's Institute is an organisation of ten thousand women in Northern Ireland And our aims really are uh to provide a centre for education, for women, to help them uh better their their lifestyle and their homes, and also to create a common ground where all women uh of  all classes and denominations can meet to discuss personal and environmental issues Garvagh is the first Institute formed in Northern Ireland and that was formed in September nineteen and thirty-two I am, the current president of the Institute And I 'm very honoured to be president in this very important year being our diamond jubilee uh of the Women 's Institute  Some of us think that we should change our image, but on the whole, we 've held our membership We 're the largest uh non-sectarian non-political women 's organisation in Northern Ireland and uh that 's some fact that we 're very proud of And I think we can hold our still our aims and our objects today as they were made out for us, sixty years ago\n<$A> The metal recycling industry is very male-dominated Uhm to say I am  alone number of one basically uhm across the UK uhm would be very close to reality Uhm I 've had to give orders to men, on all different levels I mean you 're communicating with people who are delivering to your yard You 've the travelling community, and the people who make their living from gathering scrap throughout the the Province, uhm and, you can you have to communicate with them And you also have to communicate with people like government ministers industrial development board accountants, financiers So you get a very wide range of of people, men that you have to deal with And I haven't had any particular problems in in dealing with them I find that if you 're able to prove, that you know what you 're talking about, and that you are well-versed in your subject uhm they will give you the respect that you uhm deserve And the technology side of it certainly holds no uhm barriers for me  It 's been very very rewarding and very interesting Uhm I mean I can be climbing through a uhm a shopping complex, looking at asbestos, uhm or I can be uhm in a shipyard looking at a a repair job or or a clean-up job that we 're doing on a boat It it 's just very day-to-day is so different, and that 's I think what keeps my interest and what has me there now ten years\n<$D> I 've had three businesses of my own which one was uhm sticking on false nails The other one was making leather belts and selling them all over Northern Ireland, and now uhm I 'm into the catering, spit-roasting  Right from the start, because it was such an unusual business I mean lifting hundred and twenty pound pigs and spit roast and gas bottles and trailers and and all the rest of it, and carving them up and cleaning them up it 's a pretty male business But I mean I was going to take it on anyway I mean I I thought I would like to keep it all female Because I think because it is, such a heavy manual, business, you get a better impression when you can see women doing it, you know  trailing everything in and You know cos you 've nine times out of ten would you not like a hand girls No we 're alright We can we 're fine thanks  I do find uhm especially in this business, because I am, very outgoing friendly, chatty, that men don't take me seriously Like I bang in an an invoice and uhm, you know it 's sort of och no I mean you sure you didn't do this They 'll they 'll try to get round you by, you know you dropping your price if they pay you for cash when you 've given them your price in the first place They 're dealing with the wrong person cos if you stand, up and just say look I 'm sorry and bang a few solicitors ' letters their way then they know you 're talking business Kate Mayne in business and Kate Mayne socially are really two different people to deal with Well they have to be\n\n<$D> No I don't think I could get on without men, because I really enjoy men 's company Uhm, I find I can  I can parallel I mean I am actually, and I 've an awful lot of female friends but I 've probably the same amount of male friends, that I would get you know I would I like talking to men I like hearing men 's point of view Like okay I 've got a problem What do you what what what goes on inside your head, that I do have men friends that I could say to, you know and talk over my problems that I can that I can weigh it up and see both sides Uhm so I don't think I could live without men Plus also I mean the sexual aspect 's quite pleasant \n<$F> My present status is that I choose to, to live alone Uhm, that I choose to uhm, just retain my own independence I don't feel that uhm, I don't know if that 'll change I mean I 'm thirty almost thirty-three years of age and I still don't feel that I really want to have uh a permanent relationship in my life, that would mean that I would have to make, the kind of compromises on my freedom and on my space that uh I don't and I don't think I 'm prepared to make\n<$D> Well I met a guy in the Navy when I was fifteen and a half at a party my father had And I think, if any of, any of them I I probably would have, would have been the most suitable partner for me And uhm but I I knew at the age of eighteen that he was  a lot more serious, than I I I knew I just knew there was something in me that had to live more I mean there was no way I was going to be pigeonholed, settle down ring on finger, two three four children and that was my lot I knew there was just so much more out there for me to do And so, then, there was a uhm another couple of relationships which I didn't take as seriously I knew they weren't going to go on forever and I I don't think they were as serious on me anyway And then I met the guy uhm my boss which I could not, I mean I knew he was married and I just knew look and aha I don't want this I don't need this I don't need these complications But unfortunately it was just nothing neither of us could control And then I that 's when I went to Oxford When I was in Oxford I was only too delighted that I was manless for quite a while  I think I 'd had enough by this stage And uhm, then I then I lived with a guy for four years, uh of which was fine, and uhm until I mean I I do tend to have the problem where people meet me as oh good great fun, and all the rest of it and then I 'll slowly as the relationship progresses it 's now you 're going to have to change Kate  I think that 's quite typical of uhm, Northern Irish men that they want them to become like their mothers Well there 's a present one at the minute He well he lives in Majorca and I live here It 's probably an ideal relationship for me cos I scoot over there three or four times a year and he comes over here, two times a year\n\n<$A> The the European attitude uhm very much is inclined towards women can do anything The the the barriers are not there And in Ireland we have a syndrome which I tend to refer to as the paddy factor in the greatest with the greatest of respect but it 's very much a Northern Irish syndrome\n<$B>  I think in Ulster men, they have the attitude that women should stay in the home a lot And I think uhm whenever you think of the Ulster family you think of the father coming in and expecting his Ulster fry to be on the table you know the  that the wife has made for him \n<$F> Uhm There 's no get-up-and-go in most of them There 's no, life\n<$A> My husband has a non-typical Ulster male attitude, and the reason for that is because he went away from Northern Ireland and he stood back, and he took a look at what was happening in Europe I would say my husband is a nineteen

Cos there was more pieces than I thought were originally there Spent so much time looking at a grey silent concrete wall til its emptiness screams at you, and you examine the mind fiercely, to put pictures, on that wall, to create your own art gallery, keep yourself sane, to find a place to look at I came home, I spent about six months, travelling around Ireland, telling myself I was looking for a place to live I went to visit a friend in Cork, and he said to me quite prophetically, you 'll know it when you get there I didn't believe him, until I came here, and then it caught me It captures anybody 's eye, and it holds the eye fixed on it It 's like looking at a painting You examine it, its depth and all its colours and its contours and its shapes And here, in this, most desolate but exquisitely beautiful place you find an echo of some of those pictures you hung on those concrete walls  I 'm greedy I need open spaces This a panorama vast, There 's a wonderful light because you 're you 're you 're on the on the western seaboard and there 's nothing but the Atlantic and America at the far side of it The sky and the landscape changes, constantly There 'll be skies at about five o'clock They 're like heaven 's own embroidery The colour and and the change of colour uh is incredible The sky roars at you here, You get a sense of your own tininess and insignificance I 'm just a piece of dust in the wind, when I confront all this  Up here 's a kind of, place that you can be still in Sometimes I think, walking around here,  that those stones, and I 've seen lots of stones in my time, but something makes me think of, notations on a music script I don't know why It 's as if the stones themselves are, are speaking with their own kind of rhythm It was up behind us over the hill, where I first came to stay, in a priest 's retreat, a house offered to me without me asking for it And as I drove up the hill that late October, and saw, this autumnal landscape and all the colour and I thought, maybe And I arrived at the cottage, and opened the door, and held myself chilled, as I entered It was as if it said to me, something 's going to happen here, and I was a bit terrified But because I 'm stubborn said I 'm going to stay and find out It was that night, and then the next day, looking around the old whitewashed walls I said to myself, if I take the chair out of here and the table out of here I 've been in this room before There 's rooms in the hills of Lebanon, that I slept in and tried to sleep in, and it was as if I was back there Uh, but this time it was only me making myself stay So I stayed, and in that cottage, at the foot of that hill, it all did begin there the, reclaiming of yourself, of putting back the pieces I drove over Sion Hill coming into town, and as I got to the top of the hill and saw this Ethiopian monstrosity I put the brakes on in the car and stopped dead, and said, and I can remember the moment crystal clear in my head, oh Holy Jesus Croagh Patrick Saint Patrick and the Christian Church put a name to it That mountain 's been holy before Christianity proclaimed holiness It 's a disturbing place  Right away struck, it was as if the mountain itself was pointing the finger and saying, here, come here I find when I first came here arrive in to Westport, I saw the mountain quite, nearly like it is today, and it terrified me, but it compelled me And for some strange reason that I don't care to fathom, because it intrigues me, I went to live, nearly at the foot of that and behind that mountain, on my own, to sort my own self out\n\n\n<$A> I 'm Irish That makes me stubborn It makes me very demanding Irish have a propensity, the best of them, to be hugely self-critical, self-analysing Shaw said, one of those Anglo-Irishmen, said, an Irishman 's imagination never lets him alone It 's imagination, imagination, imagination But maybe the part of Ireland that I come from, and here 's the qualification, born working-class, Protestant, East Belfast, grew up, with all the cultural baggage that 's attendant upon you I grew up in a culture, whether others want to mark it Protestant or Catholic or whether others want to mark it Loyalist and Republican, or all the other received terminology, that we 've been labelled with All I know is I grew up in a culture which is, resistant and at the same time, it 's defensive And all that cultural baggage, even though I thought I 'd purged myself of it, having gone to university and met other people from, different parts of Ireland with different viewpoints to me, but was still with me, years and years later And I 'm quite grateful for it, that sense of, being resistant, of being, defensive I know what no surrender means cos I was born with it, but I 'd learnt its meaning, and its quality, and its profundity I 'm grateful for where I came from But I 'm even more grateful I 'm Irish\n\n<$A> It says in the Koran, my translation is not very good, but it 's the uh the prophet 's words, to the followers and it relates to hostages, and the keeping of captives, and it roughly translates,  give them the Koran, that they may take with them, when they

to keep myself together After my release, making a new life for myself it was this place in the West of Ireland that I found a suitable sheltering place Westport a, <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> part of the West of Ireland No matter how scenic or wonderful or pleasant the place is, it 's only given that quality by, the people who live in it Although it 's a busy little town  uh quite cosmopolitan in many respects, uh there 's something, you know that rural mind that has uh, a kind of respect for privacy, uh a kind of understanding instinctual, of a person 's dignity It 's it 's one of those places which I I I I think the rural mind have, where it can take hold of you, shake your hand, love you, but leave you alone\n\n\n<$A> I don't believe in doctrines, dogmas, the legal fabrication of the Church We all have the capacity within ourselves to be our own confessor, our own healer, our own regenerator We need a time, a place for that I find lots of places  When you 've nothing but, four concrete walls compressing in on you all the time, you need to find the way out of that Prayer was an exit point, uh an exit point from the physical reality of that tininess, but it was also a an entry point into oneself And in time and in labour, and uh I 'm  and occasionally in tears, you find the immensity within oneself, that the tininess of the confinement, was expansive Prayer is a kind of way of, finding yourself, of talking to yourself, of coming home  I 'd an awareness of, not being alone, that, some other presence was there I 'd a, I suppose it 's the way the mind works, a constant feeling of, my father, who died about two and a half years before I went off on my sojourn in Lebanon It was almost a voice saying, come, I 'll take you through it All the labyrinths and the dark places open up because of this reassuring presence, which was my own father I remember saying to uh the guy I was locked up with, on one or two occasions, one of the many things I want to do when I get out of here is, go and see my father 's grave, because I hadn't And I remember the the gravestone, it 's uhm red Indian marble It took me a long time traipsing about the streets of Belfast to get that red Indian marble, but I never went to see it erected, and I hadn't seen it  I came here a long time ago for a walk one morning and found this place, a holy well with its litany of rules, a ritual of movement, something so alien to my own background And here were those numbers that I knew so well, seven times round and seven times round again, and kneeling down three times and turning round three times All those sums that I counted in my head, and all those days that I was locked up, as if, mathematics was there before mankind in a search for meaning captured them into this tradition This comes from a mind older than Christianity And there it was, me for days and hours and weeks, counting the days and trying to divide the days and put one sum into another sum to make the sum of all the days smaller I remember trying to count one day, the number of pieces of an eggshell, that counting, and then dividing the number you got by another number, as if you could crush time out, by using time to destroy time Can't be done How can you kill time  You didn't want to keep time You wanted to get rid of time Used to crawl towards door, stretch out as far as your chain would allow you, and listen, to the news on the radio an event would mark the time There was that awful early morning panic about, is there enough left in my head to get me through this day Does the mind ever get empty Is there anything left And the lesson you learn in that awful interminable time is, the mind is never empty The mind 's too rich to be imprisoned  Blood and bruises and a beaten body heals That sort of pain goes away, but there 's another kind of hurt that doesn't, that stays And it 's humiliation, particularly if you become a confederate to those who humiliate you by allowing yourself to be humiliated\n\n<$A> I suppose, what the two of us learnt together was, the absolute assurance, that a man or men may take my liberty But they can never ever take my freedom I guess we both had a, deep concern about that, maintaining freedom, maintaining dignity, maintaining trust, and always fully understanding, that, it 's in what we give, that we survive  I think back occasionally to those men  that kept us, with a degree, and probably quite a deep degree of sympathy and pity And their only truth is ultimately, that they 're chained to their guns I 'm free in a way

{"text": "<Frontline 1>\n\n\n<$A> It 's easy to raise a laugh like that in Belfast It 's the laughter of contempt, contempt for our own gullibility in thinking that the long war was ending, contempt for those who still try to string out our hopes My name is Malachi O'Doherty I 'm a journalist here in Belfast This place continually hovers between peace and disaster, weeks when hardly anything happens, weeks when someone 's being killed nearly every day It 's like breathing in and breathing out Months ago we were told that the Republican movement was ready to settle terms with the British That would 've changed everything It hasn't happened I want to know what 's holding things up  I doubt that the IRA want anything at all but to win  Change is coming to Northern Ireland, but an end to the killing That depends on gunmen If it was just a cruel joke that the conflict was over, then it was no more cruel than a lot of things that happen here Now there 's no way I can go into the secret heart of the IRA and see what they are thinking and planning What I can do, is go into the community they inhabit, and see what pressures there might be on them there, either to settle terms now, or get on with the struggle\n<$B> This is an ancient historic Irish town, full of Irish people and with this imposed upon us Your presence here on the street is far more important than any meeting anybody can have with any minister or anybody else sitting there with a cup of tea and saying ha what about this old chap Your coming out shows that you 're opposed to this You have the power \n<$A> Where the IRA is most active you will always find local conditions that fire them up Each area is fighting a different war I 've come to Crossmaglen on the border There are few Protestants here, and Republicanism builds on a popular distaste for the army The people are out protesting The Provos have got the soldiers in their sights  Only the Irish flag will ever fly freely here A British flag would need an armed guard The only peace that will ever hold here, will be an Irish peace The old Republican war cry is Brits out In South Armagh it 's hard to explain why Brits should be in There are no peace lines to defend here because there are no ghettoes The whole area is Catholic Irish Nationalist, and an army presence like this is viewed as foreign, and intrusive This really is like a land under occupation\n<$B> I can't see that the IRA will be asking for anything less than total British withdrawal in the long term not necessarily tomorrow morning kind of thing and people understand that But in a town like this to go back to that question in a town like Crossmaglen uhm, even a remnant of the British Army remaining here would be a source of tension and will not aid the Peace Process There would be a sizeable section of people who 'll see them as uhm more than an irritant, as a major source of the problem and therefore violence will continue while they are here\n<$A> A ground-swell of Nationalist opinion is strong and unruffled here These people don't all support the IRA of course, but whatever compromise others choose to make, their sense that the British are the problem, is solid and unchanged\n<$C> The British Army 's role in South Armagh in particular and uh elsewhere in is well it 's debatable uhm their their role anywhere 's debateable Certainly in South Armagh they aren't protecting anybody here, because uhm as you can see from the turnout here today nobody particularly wants them here\n<$A> In Belfast it is different This city could 've been designed for conflict, not between the Irish and the British, but between Protestants and Catholics They live in separate streets and housing estates, with separate, irreconcilable identities  The issue between them was whether this place is British, or Irish Some people here accept that there will have to be a compromise that will allow it to be both Many do not  The playwright Martin Lynch has a strong sense of the mood and the convictions of the people of Catholic West Belfast, where he lives In his plays he has frequently explored the roots of paramilitary violence, and the fears and feelings of his own community\n<$D> And I can remember right  right over for instance the, the Christmas period groups of people, people at my age and older who who only know the Troubles in in some senses uhm or who 've had spent all their adult lives in the Troubles, for the first time seriously beginning to contemplate what it might be like, to have peace People were saying like wonder what 'd be like to walk into downtown without being searched What it 'd be like to walk down the streets and have no Brits about What it 'd be like not to have the Provos you know hijacking every now or again or shooting somebody People actually were asking questions like that which I don't remember, uh anything like that in the seventies and eighties The problem is that I mean as the months went on I think a lot of people a lot of people began to say well you know it 's another uh cul-de-sac and there isn't much hope \n<$E> And welcome again to uh the second of our Talkback election phone-ins today Waiting your calls on Belfast three two five seven five seven that 's oh two three two three two five seven five seven the President of Sinn Fe/in Gerry Adams\n<$A> The hopes of an end to the IRA campaign, rest on this one man The history of Republicanism could be traced through Gerry Adams ' wardrobe The suit represents the credible politician phase He wouldn't always have dressed up for a visit to a Radio Ulster studio, at the British Broadcasting Corporation\n<$F> Now I personally would like to ask you whether or not you intend, to join the rest of humanity in clawing our way out of this primeval swamp, stop this violence and stop it now There is absolutely no mandate from anyone, in Ireland or in England for you to continue to sanction the killing of innocent men women and children\n<$G> I 'm very glad Mary you got to the point there The reality of the situation is, there is a Peace Process going on, but it 's my firm conviction that Peace Process, will conclude with a peace settlement As part of that Sinn Fe/in and everyone else needs to be involved\n<$E> Okay well thanks for your call now As I say we we 're very very busy at the moment \n<$A> In the seventies when Adams looked like a student, and talked about overthrowing the Dublin government too, he may have felt a dignified arrest was only his due As the charismatic star of Republicanism, he used to dismiss Loyalists as neo-fascists Now he is saying they have to be included He has changed enough to work through Dublin, but will he concede to Protestant fears and call the gunmen off\n<$G> The personal priority, for me, is to move this situation forward, into a negotiated peace settlement to bring about a lasting peace \n<$A> The man who believes that Adams has changed is John Hume, the leader of Sinn Fe/in 's chief rival party the SDLP  His recent thumping for Euro votes won him the thanks of Belfast Catholics for his peace efforts  John Hume 's political career grew out of the same unrest in the late sixties, which threw the Catholic community into conflict with the state He committed himself to peaceful change An irony in his regard for Adams now, is that he suffered at the hands of the IRA for the course he followed\n<$H> My home used to be picketed by supporters of the Provisional IRA Uh it used to be daubed and painted by them Uh two cars were destroyed by them and indeed the the the last attack which was in nineteen eighty-seven was the worst ever when five hooded men, fire-bombed my home, with my wife and daughter inside and destroyed my wife 's car sitting at the door So uh, I 've, as I say I 've been opposed to violence, all my life\n<$A> Those who have not opposed violence have been forced to live behind grilles and barriers  Their leader Gerry Adams was cleared of some of the stigma, though none of the danger, when John Hume stooped to talk terms with him They signed an accord suggesting that the Dublin government could guarantee the rights of the Unionists There was a nifty little device at the heart of the Hume Adams accord It was that the border which the Provos had been bombing the British to get rid of would stay, but this time under a guarantee from the Irish Government, not from the British Now the Provos might not like that, but it would leave them no excuse to bomb the Brits They could say well if you don't like it take it up with Dublin Now if this was the beginning of a real political process it was one that was going to lead to compromise The Provos knew that, and they bought it  The popular view is that the IRA are more mercenary than political, only in it for the money So if they are ready to stop they must be broke This is claimed in the British media, by sources close to the intelligence services  The IRA is said to be siphoning money from drinking-clubs, pirating videos and hawking fake perfume And there have been recent claims of police success, against IRA rackets But how credible are these police claims to be busting up the IRA 's racketeering I 've my doubts about them I sometimes wonder if they don't belong more to the propaganda war than to anything else These stories 've been cropping up for years and if you go into any library and look at the cutting 's file, you 'll see exactly what I mean It 's an old story Go back to nineteen eighty-seven and the papers are reporting the squeeze is being put on the paramilitaries A year later, in the same paper, the same story the same word a squeeze that 's getting tighter on them Come into the nineties the IRA 's blood money is being cut off In fact through that whole period the IRA was getting progressively more active, not less And then you come up into the present day, and it 's that word again the squeeze on terror funding None of this is a credible explanation of why the IRA should now want to settle terms And in fact the police themselves say privately that when the IRA want more money, they 'll go out and steal it\n\n<$I> Hello Who 's

time Luckily for  for for us Sean was the only one was in the living-room because by by the devastation, we we seen caused by the bullets there was up to sixty armour-piercing rounds fired, anyone that was in the living-room that, that evening uh would 've been killed\n<$B> In November Bobby Lavery 's home was shot up again Another son crouched in terror as bullets peppered the shutters This family lives in darkness and in danger, determined not to move Bobby has been shaken by the grief\n<$A> Emotionally, I have been destroyed And from time to time, you feel like you just want to walk away You really do It 's just too much, too much Mentally the  the pressure was uh can be excruciating at times Then when you think of all the suffering that everybody 's going through I mean  I don't think there 's anybody in the in the Six Counties, who hasn't been affected in some fashion or other\n<$B> Hundreds of Republican families live on their nerves like this, but they don't ask the IRA to ease up Why not Do they think the struggle is really worth it Or do they think that the IRA wouldn't listen Well in some places they do  Derry was the second city of the Troubles Like Crossmaglen it has a Catholic majority but now it suffers only one in fifty of the violent deaths here  There is a sense that old grievances have been settled Catholics run the town, sharing power in Council with Unionists  Yet once the IRA had the free run of this city  Father Michael Collins is Parish Priest of the Long Tower Church over the Catholic Bogside He knows what demotivates people here, and he has seen the change over the years He remembers the ardent old Republican, who was once enraged by a call in his church for prayers for a dead soldier\n<$C> He came up into the pulpit, took over the microphone uh and addressed the congregation, very forthrightly on uh, his Republican beliefs I, see him outside, the church there on a Sunday morning now twenty-five years later and uh, he 's had a stroke He 's had uh, bad health for the past while And, it is hard to identify, those two, images in one 's mind, a man whose, health is declining and a man who was so full of enthusiasm, uh on that particular morning But that is, I think symptomatic of everybody We have all, lived with uh the Troubles for the past twenty-five years, so I think there must be, a certain war-weariness, creeping in and that doesn't just apply to us It applies to the Provisional IRA and to Sinn Fe/in and to all the Republican movement as well\n\n<$B> Some Republicans now feel the need of a quieter life and a safer life for themselves and their children Surely then a compromise like the Joint Declaration should appeal to them  The Declaration assures Nationalists of the right to self-determination for the Irish people as a whole It says that Britain has no selfish interest in Northern Ireland, but only wants peace here But if the British really have no interests here why don't they just say they 're getting out That 's the Republican argument Republicans may also feel from their own secret contacts with the British, that there 's more to be gained if they just give it another push The Downing Street Declaration is an elegant document, but does that diplomatic language promise more than is really on offer\n<$D> I think one of the problems with the the Declaration, is that from the British point of view it addresses the issue, which is significant and welcome, but then it appears to say, you have the right to self-determination but, and goes on to qualify it My view is you can't have half of a right, or a third of a right, you either have the right, or not We of course have that right, that 's denied us, by by by uh external impediment, by British interference How we exercise that right, without internal or external  impediment is just a matter of, common sense\n<$B> Adams makes it all sound very easy, but that external impediment is the same old promise that while Unionists are in the majority they are safe For Republicans that means that nothing has changed  The Declaration assures Unionists, that the government will work for agreement without pre-judging or prescribing the result, and that only majority consent in the North can ever bring about a united Ireland Now that 's fine as far as it goes, but that right of the majority in the North to hold up a united Ireland, was a tripwire for Republicans what they call a Unionist veto What was different about the document that Gerry Adams signed with John Hume was that it contained the idea of a timeframe, effectively a deadline on the Unionists, to come to agreement Now that implies a big stick And a big stick a penalty for not agreeing whatever that was to be, would compel Unionists to compromise, to relax their insistence that Ulster is as British as Birmingham or Finchley\n<$D> I think without being patronising, you know the Unionists have an understandable and very severe, uh identity crisis And I and I think, that an an Ireland which we build, has to reflect, the Unionist strand, of our history\n<$E> So long as it isn't British like, I mean what they would say is there are two nationalities on the island of Ireland\n<$D> Whereas you know that isn't the case yourself\n<$E> I don't know that Well I 'm representing   what they might say \n<$D>  Well I mean   I know but  everybody knows that isn't the case You can't actually I  I mean you, we don't have two nationalities We have a, a  a difference of political allegiance Those who would have a general notion, of allegiance to Ireland, and those who would have a notion of allegiance towards the union \n<$B> Whatever Gerry Adams thinks about the right of Protestants to imagine themselves to be British, Protestants themselves have little trust, that he understands them at all  Republicans will have to deal with working-class Protestants, but they are clearly in no mood to yield\n<$F> We are, British We 've always been British and we always want to be British They say they want all-Ireland, but they can't be an all-Ireland because the majority of the people in the North, want to stay British Uh if they don't want to be British, there 's a big there 's twenty-six states down the South for them\n<$G> Just get out\n<$F> Well if they don't want to  live under our rule Now at the end of the day it 's  you say we go back til the majority rules, and until the day, where the vote comes, that they want to make this an all-Ireland, it 's still our country We own it\n<$H> That 's it I 've said that before If I was a Republican and I didn't, I wanted to be a Republican and they didn't want me to be, I 'd go down the South and be a Republican \n<$B> Do they not think themselves though that to get out of this deadlock that they have to adapt a bit to the Republican version of what the problem is, and to accept that their leaders will one day have to sit down and talk to Sinn Fe/in\n<$I> The Provisional IRA 'd have to, not ceasefire not a couple of days they 'd have to say right that 's it The terrorism 's over We 're at the table And that 's it That 's how they 'd do it That 's the only way to do it But you can't come to the table, as in speaking to people at the table and meanwhile somebody 's out putting a car bomb under their motor like You can't do that That 's not, it 's not ethical like is it\n<$B> If the fears of Protestants are so strong, and if even the IRA accept that there can be no settlement unless they agree to it, why doesn't the IRA lift the pressure on them and give them a chance If Republicans are serious, couldn't more be achieved by a ceasefire Two British Secretaries of State have negotiated ceasefires with the IRA, William Whitelaw in nineteen seventy-two, and Merlyn Reece in seventy-five The IRA feel that both were tricks, and they 'll say that 's why they 're wary of calling another  Now that sounds like a handy excuse, but they have other reasons too There 's one man who should be able to throw some light on this He 's been a Republican for over forty years He 's been a member of the Army Council of the IRA, and he 's been a Director of Operations for the IRA In the seventies he was President of Sinn Fe/in, and he negotiated truce with the British Government  Ruairi/ O/ Bra/daigh leads the Republican Sinn Fe/in, a separate party sidelined by Gerry Adams, who see themselves as the last true Republicans He tested the will of the British, face-to-face\n<$J> It was a very rocky uhm progress First of all the British Government weren't prepared to deliver, on the main issue They told us of course that uh, British Ministers individually were in favour of getting out of Ireland and we know that the British Cabinet Committee on Ireland had considered the options of British withdrawal They told us that British ministers individually were in favour of this, but we said uh, what we wanted was a collective decision, and that permanent peace, would be available in return, for this decision of the British government When it became finally clear that indeed the British were not going to deliver, well then uh the IRA responded with a series of operations, in September There was a very, sore lesson learned for a great number of years after that, No truces or ceasefires appear to have been considered at all\n<$B> Ceasefires are dangerous Volunteers lose their resolve  but they are hyped up for war and have nothing to do The organisation slackens and is vulnerable to spies Without major concessions the risk isn't worth it Of course that determination has mellowed a little The IRA called a ceasefire in April for three days It wasn't much The fact is they 're still intensely suspicious of the British They feel they were conned before They don't want to be conned again And some of their closest political allies are telling them that the Downing Street Declaration is a lure without substance\n\n<$B> Bernadette McAliskey as she is rarely heard, in an Irish-language cafe on the Falls Road  Her commitment to political struggle and her colourful past, make her a popular figure here She has been working outside the Republican movement, but for the same goals  She 's tough After the Bloody Sunday killings in Derry as a young MP, in the House of Commons she thumped the Home Secretary Reginald Maudling\n<$K>   Do you intend to apologise to Mr Maudling or \n<$L> I 'm just sorry I didn't get him by the throat\n<$?> Well said\n<$L> The Downing Street Declaration does not provide uh even a hint of a mechanism, which would allow political differences to be discussed or resolved So uh, it 's hard to see what Republicans, were even being asked to settle for other than what the document spelt out And the Downing Street Declaration to me clearly spelt out, a commitment by the Irish and British Government to continue with Six County solution, and uh to recreate the political structure within it", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e6948d64-9e15-4b0c-b1cd-933007a18315", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.409612+00:00"}
{"text": "<Video Diaries 1>\n\n\n<$A> My name 's Robert Wilson I live in Oxford, which is nice, if a bit dull The last political murder in Oxford was two hundred and fifty years ago, the Oxford murder However until I was nineteen I lived in Belfast, which is a vastly different story The last political murder in Belfast was two and half days ago The BBC asked me to go back, check it out, so I am going back to Belfast, the <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> town\n\n<$A> I 'm conscious that Belfast serves as a startling contrast to Oxford  In the six years that I 'd been away, I found I 'd moved a long way from the made-to-measure proletarian background, seemingly so essential for an Irish Catholic writer  The overwhelming security of places like Oxford, had hardened my attitude to Belfast Since living in England I 'd tried my utmost to take a dim view of my hometown, but it 's difficult Like most ex-Irishmen Belfast bewilders and seduces me in equal measure  It was strange and exhilarating to be back in Belfast and find that so much was the same The same brashness, the same confusion, the same voices competing for your ear Already there seemed to be a surplus of people, lured by my brand new English accent, willing to offer me advice But I confess that my first thought was to find someone willing to hold the camera every now and then  It has to be said, I don't usually return to my hometown encumbered by a television camera And with this in mind I felt I needed a confederate My first and last choice was Glenn Patterson, a passing Protestant novelist\n<$B> When they said film people, I think they meant plural\n<$A> I had a camera, I had a sidekick, and I was back in Belfast I was here to find out what I wanted from it, which I 'd always thought was nothing Perhaps this way I could find out for sure\n\n<$B> You can't avoid the past You can't, uh  you can't shake it off at all It 's like it 's like having sellotape stuck to your hand you know You pull it off and it sticks to the other hand And the more you keep pulling at it and working with it the muckier it gets\n\n<$A> One of the exciting things I did on this trip, was to meet my father for the first time in fifteen years Here he is  Uh, and since he 's my dad, he 's invited me to come stay with him for a few days, here on the Falls Road Look at those steady hands on that wheel Look at those nicotine stains whoa  I 'd only been back in Belfast a few days, and it was already tempting to see myself in the role of the dissident Catholic The problem is that too many people would endorse this view When the world thinks of an Irishman, it thinks of a Catholic, but there are these things called Irish Protestants who 've been here for four hundred years Glenn Patterson, successful novelist and Presbyterian, hasn't been here that long but he can still teach me something about Irishness\n<$B> What 's important is actually working out what it is to be from here, and to work to work through that I don't know what to call myself This is one of my my great problems I never know what to call I know I know my name, but I I never know whether to call myself, Northern Irish I I it 's it 's a crisis of you don't know how to even say the name of where you come from Uh everything is everything is so heavily, imbued with significance If you say the North of Ireland you know people have got this peculiar sense of hearing They can they can get all the political affiliations just from what you call the country I mean the Six Counties is an obvious one Ulster is the other obvious one This is uh Wedderburn Park where I, grew up And in here on the right, is, a most famous local amenity, which is the crazy golf course You could only actually hit it, you 'd only  had one go at each hole  And then after that that was it, you were back at the beginning again, which is uhm, heavily symbolic It 's a curious thing this question of belonging Whenever I 'm here, I 'm desperate to get away And whenever I 'm over there in Manchester I 'm desperate to get back to Belfast I swear sometimes I think the only time I 'm truly happy, is when I 'm in the plane, that one hour in between Turf Lodge is that way\n<$A> Turf Lodge is where I grew up It 's a mile and a half from where Glenn lived, but he 's never been there\n<$B> You can see it from the bedroom window Shall we go and look through the, square window This is uh twelfth of July nineteen seventy-five in Belfast, and appearing here that 's me, walking in my one and only Twelfth of July, which my mum swears I was paid ten shillings to do, and I wish I could remember, that I that I was paid that that I I think I may just 've done it cos I wanted to And now you 'll see what I was doing whenever Robert was out, throwing stones\n<$A> Actually, it 's unfair to say that I was throwing stones We searched the BBC archives and as you can see, I was merely observing\n<$B> It 's hard it 's hard actually to to think of what stage you, you know I was fifteen fourteen coming on  fourteen thirteen fourteen at that time, and, it 's hard to know when, when you started, coming out of that, or how you how you, dissociate yourself from it, or how you didn't become uhm, you know how it didn't become the focal point of your life I think really the only thing is is just luck I actually was in this band for a stage but I was a, I was crap I was a dummy fluter I was a dummy Irish dummy dummy Irishman and a dummy Orangeman  and a dummy Irishman and a dummy bloody Englishman as well This is uh here you see, the problem you know we 're nothing You, completely know where you belong out here I don't know \n\n<$A> I 'd now been back a week and I was getting depressed by the enormity of what I 'd taken on Already I didn't know where I was  I 'm so depressed God I 'm happy And I just want to go home I just want to stop now God I 'm happy I feel real shame I am completely elated, and I can't take any more of Belfast I 'm in Belfast, and I want to be I nearly got arrested again today It 's unbelievable This is our house on the Falls Road My Da actually and has two bathrooms I wish I 'd never taken this on  Actually I did know where I was I knew exactly where I was On the Falls Road with the Wilson Clan  I have to say it wasn't really helping They seemed to regard the whole thing as a bit of a joke, Robert messing around with his camera  I think they found it difficult to understand that this strange lost relative of theirs, was undergoing so much difficulty in trying to define the Falls Road, an area so familiar to them, and surprisingly so free of significance  I suppose I 'd moved a long way from West Belfast I 'd certainly forgotten a hell of a lot I was bringing anglicised Oxbridge notions to bear on a place which England has never really understood I was even feeling all the sweaty unease of a Troubles virgin, in the very area which I could by rights describe as my home However I hadn't been away so long that the prevalent atmosphere of suspicion, fear and constant surveillance, didn't quickly revive a few memories, and produce one or two new ideas for good or ill One of the things that the liberal British find most difficult to understand about a place like the Falls Road, is the attitude to the police and the army The attitude seems to be one of unmixed hatred and resentment   But what you got to understand, is that the police and the army, are not a force of law and order for the Falls Road They 're a force of law and order against the Falls Road They police against this community And it 's difficult to feel anything else but resentment, when it is like that I mean I myself was beaten up just here, yup just there, when I was sixteen walking up to the Royal for physiotherapy on crutches, in my school uniform and a foot patrol still kicked the crap out of me I mean it really is hard It 's hard not to let that piss you off So this attitude, if not excusable is at least comprehensible And since the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Protestant communities, such as this one in Sandy Row, traditionally supporters of the security forces, no longer feel that the police and the army operate in their favour either The resulting mixture of resentment and betrayal in the Loyalist community, has changed the political temperature of Northern Ireland There are no longer only the two well-known divided societies, Protestant and Catholic There is now a third, equally isolated and equally self-protecting, the security forces themselves\n<$?> Who are you filming for\n<$A> One of the largest outlets for public expenditure in the Province and one of the country 's largest employers, the third of the three\n\n\n<$A> When I was sixteen, I was kicked out of home for going out with a Protestant girl I learnt then that social workers really run the twentieth-century city John Growcot, was a social worker who saved my particular bacon He 's well qualified to talk about the substance of Belfast\n<$C> One of the features of Belfast I think, as someone who 's lived here all my life, is that deprivation is very localised, and it 's rooted West Belfast for example has major problems, major problems in terms of unemployment major problems in terms of property In the east of the city, there are pockets of deprivation But there are large parts of the city, remarkably, which are untouched effectively by the Troubles, and which are untouched, by the deprivation which is so much a feature of those other areas And I think people, Belfast as a city has a vibrancy, has a life Its poorest its most deprived people have an integrity, which enables them, to move through the difficulties, in a way which is remarkable At a broader level, I think Belfast simply reflects how society as a whole deals with inequalities  I would see Belfast perhaps as different I wouldn't wish to say more difficult, more as different And it 's different because of the unique problems which we have And those problems are essentially the historical realities of sectarianism, and the historical divisions within our society  Social services would tend to become involved where families, are suffering as a direct consequence of their location in terms of communal disputes  Just across from the office here actually is Manor Street, which is one of the sectarian front line divides In July eighty-seven, there was a major , there was a major outburst of sectarian violence across that peace line which necessitated the moving out of a number of families It 's a difficult area People in both sides of that interface face major difficulties, dreadful difficulties with at times nightly rioting between youths from both areas Now social services, have really very little to offer because the resource which those people desperately need is housing, but housing is such a scarce priority, compounded by the fact that people very much wish to remain within their own communities and exhaust available stock within those communities", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "93f7173f-bb0b-43c9-b53d-b7307851765d", "added":

{"text": "<Video Diaries 2>\n\n\n<$A> Around the time that I was filming John, a man was shot dead in Derriaghy by the IPLO, who later apologised for killing an innocent man Last night was a mistake the spokesman said But last night was just murder It was just death That man is dead That 's all he is He 's not a victory or a defeat for anyone He 's just a corpse He wasn't the day before And this is literally senseless If you take time to think, you take time to think about what has happened everything in in you screams, in outrage How can it have happened\n\n<$A> Belfast does its business again Where is the mandate for murder here Who benefited by last night I dunno why it 's pissed me off so much but, just what a waste of time What a waste of more than time What a waste of life What a fatuous thing to say It death renders  any comment ludicrous He 's just dead\n<$B> There 's nothing I can say, nor would I seek to say anything which would excuse what what has happened in this community There 'd be some dreadful acts of violence, which really in some ways are beyond my capacity to understand I can't I can't understand how someone can take another person 's life in the callous way in which it 's happened here And no ideology, no political hope can ever justify that I think of yourself and myself who come from very similar social backgrounds, and there are many people from those backgrounds who have found themselves in the midst, of organisations on both sides of this community, who engage in acts of violence, and I 've often asked myself why I 'm not, one of those people, Luck Luck I think is probably yeah Luck 's the answer I think To do with choice Things run your way at particular times in your life You make the right choices, fate whatever intervenes Others didn't have that luxury, didn't have that opportunity perhaps never wanted that opportunity They 're now locked into something, which is just an ideology in its totality, and which is the justification for their existence and their lives and they can see nothing beyond that That 's my explanation \n<$A> People here complain that television focuses on the bad side of Belfast And they 'll probably complain that I 'm doing the same thing But I hope that the people I 've chosen to talk to, show something like the best side of Belfast \n<$B> I do like Belfast people, in spite of everything There 's a warmth, uh there 's an acceptance and there 's something here which is just within me which I can identify with The episodes, the more horrific episodes of violence inevitably, give me cause, for reflection I 've just recently become a father, and I think, I 'll have at some point to make a decision as to whether or not I would want my own child, to grow up in a community where regrettably, there 's such a level of violence and there 's such an an unfortunate degree, of prejudice And I think that would have to be acknowledged and said It 's not true by any means of the majority of the people but it 's there, and it interferes in one 's life, and when you 've responsibility for another person 's life, it becomes that much more difficult to justify remaining\n<$A> So we learn that the Berlin Wall is coming down, which is sensational news for all concerned But meanwhile just up the road, I discover a new peace wall near the Whiterock separating Belfast 's working classes, another part of the maze of Belfast brick divisions So while the world is pulling them down, Belfast is whacking them up at a great rate And the thought occurs to you you don't want it to but it does, that some of the people must want this, otherwise why would it happen They work hard at their divisions They seem to yearn for confrontation Unfraternity inequality illiberty \n<$C> I still see Northern Ireland as as relevant way beyond, Northern Ireland I mean it it doesn't exist, within it 's like uh the border 's like a lasso thrown around the Six Counties and torn You know it 's it 's something that stranglehold that uhm that Britain still has, upon us I mean it it 's the the the vacuum that was created, within that border, political vacuum uh in which all the events in the last twenty years have taken place I think it wasn't the creation of the people of Northern Ireland themselves Catholic or Protestant It wasn't their sole doing It 's far too easy to look at what 's going on here, and say this is a creation of sick minds and sick people <unclear> 1 syll </unclear> uh the atrocities that happen, lead to a a fairly understandable emotional reaction But if you apply any sort of logic to this place at all you see that what 's going on, you can't see it as anything else other than the a bottleneck created by the traffic of history And that 's English history too\n<$A> How do you feel about sharing your city with people who murder on a regular basis\n<$C> Well they wouldn't be my favourite people to share a city with But then what city doesn't have murder on a regular basis I would  you can't leave this city I that 's a terrible question I can't answer that I just don't agree with that question at all I do I don't agree with the question never mind the answer  , What  about what about people in London who murder on you know regular basis The regular basis doesn't doesn't elevate it You know we have whereas murder is murder is murder wherever it is\n<$A>  Why not  \n<$A> There 's not so much\n<$C> Sorry\n<$A> There 's not so much in London\n<$C> There 's not so much\n<$A> In London\n<$C> No there 's not but then there 's not the there 's not the the historical situation that 's produced what we have here I mean you can't on the one hand say that uhm, you know that that what is going on here is the bottleneck created by the traffic of history, and then say how do you feel about sharing a city with people who murder on a regular basis I loathe it I loathe it completely But you can't just turn away from it, nor can you say that, we are innately, bound, to murder in this country If you believed that you wouldn't live here If you believed that you wouldn't write here\n<$B> And it looks like Glenn manages to both live here and write here with equal success  Being with the bold Glenn Patterson was beginning to cheer me up, and also helping me with my film  I was beginning to get a whole new slant on things  Glenn was beginning to feel more comfortable in front of the camera, which was a good job since he was so useless behind it  All in all I was feeling happier than usual to be in Belfast It actually looked as though there were good times to be had after all \n<$C> My greatest anger is not with Belfast or with people, who cause violence in Belfast Uh uh a lot of I mean,  it it 's nothing new to say that a lot of the people who got involved in violence, uh who came from very similar backgrounds to you, and similar backgrounds to me on the other side when they were very young, and, it angers me to see, both the  the waste of life of people who have been killed but also the waste of life of people who have been imprisoned They 've been caught up And what angers me and saddens me most about what has happened here is the fact that it was all so needless\n<$A> Sociologists lament the psychological crisis of Belfast It is a stressful habitat Much of the casual violence and almost all of the prevalent drunkenness is the product of these subliminal stresses Glenn and I were anxious to investigate, the drunkenness at least\n\n<$A> What would have to happen here for you to leave\n<$C> <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> for me to leave Uh somebody give me sixty-seven quid and a two-week advance ticket No  What would happen,  what would have to happen for me to leave I don't think, I don't think you can actually say that there, you know that there 's anything I mean who wants to predict I wouldn't like to say it cos I would you know God knows it would probably happen Something quite enormous Well I mean what would what would have to happen you 're asking to make you abandon hope altogether And I don't think you ever would Uh you can't because, you short of us all evacuating the island, somebody 's going to be here, and somehow we 're going to have to work it out And I 'd quite like to, to be part of the working out\n\n<$A> Most who live in Belfast try for optimism Success is gauged by how easy optimism comes And for Glenn it seems to come easier and more considered than most  He seems to feel more affection for Belfast than me Unlike me he believes that Belfast cannot be held entirely to blame He looks elsewhere for fault  Glenn Patterson truly loves his city He 's an advocate for Belfast He was almost beginning to persuade me in its favour\n\n<$A> One of the reasons that so much of what is said about Belfast is so patently unreliable is the fact that Belfast is an incredibly confusing city Uhm, depression is visible I mean you see it on TV all the time It 's easy to make Belfast look depressing But also because euphoria lies idle in the streets It 's everywhere It 's so easy to pick up Soon you 're you 're in a constant, state of choice What am I going to be  And this state of choice is an historic Irish characteristic Usually the choice available has been despair and loss However, for a brief time in nineteen seventy-six, Belfast achieved something like the state of euphoria with the birth of the Peace People, a movement which ignored religious boundaries and simply aimed for the achievement of peace  The movement was led by Mairead Corrigan, Betty Williams and Ciaran McKeown When the Peace People were destroyed by the suspicion and paranoia of politicians paramilitaries and press, it was these three figures who suffered the most vicious opprobrium When I first met Ciaran McKeown I admit that I was to some degree infected with this disease of doubt He 'd been the bogeyman of my childhood, the latest of the hate figures I almost wanted to distrust him\n<$D> I sometimes think there is a generalised uh, low intensity depression afflicting people, which they only notice if they go away for a while and live in a a  somewhat freer or more open society and then come back Uhm and they 're immediately aware of all the stresses all the uhm filtering, the automatic filtering that goes on all the time even among people who imagine themselves to be uh unbigoted, unprejudiced, uhm relatively liberated people It 's a very inward, looking society in many ways It 's and it 's really quite an unhealthy place\n<$A> Last night here in Sevastapol Street as we were leaving my Dad 's house, we saw a man being arrested arrested in inverted commas It was by a selection of police army and plain clothes RUC men They got the guy here near the bottom of the street and they ran him up the street to some jeeps waiting up at the top And he had a gun held to his neck with the hammer cocked, running full pace up this street And of all the things it looked like it looked most like a child being pulled along by the ear by, by a parent or a teacher And the policeman 's colleagues were all out with the machine guns at safety catches off There were kids all over the street There were old people standing at the doors It was terrifying The the police were screaming in their own terror It was just dreadful I mean, it didn't look like a way to conduct police or state business It looked like South Africa It looked like Bolivia Chile It looked like Northern Ireland", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Harvest Home>\n\n\n<$A> Anybody I 've ever met, and I meet a lot of people and I make it my business to try and bring people into the Province In other words there 's no point in talking about it Come here and experience it And those people who do come and do experience it have told me on many occasions, it is definitely the best-kept secret \n<$B> And I think there has been an element amongst the Protestant middle classes for the last twenty years as long as there was uh, there was plenty of ice for the gin and tonic and as long as they could uh,  the local golf course the greens were kept well-clipped, and there was a  a reasonable wage packet coming in every Friday uhm they really didn't give a toss\n<$C> I I think they are most certainly not pulling their weight in political life Indeed I would go so far as to say that, since nineteen twenty-one, such weight as they have ever pulled has been constantly on the decline\n<$D> I think the dangers are that the middle classes of Northern Ireland and particularly the Protestant middle classes can leave it to others to try and sort out the problems of Northern Ireland In the meantime you can enjoy some of the best scenery, some of the nicest people, and live on the belief that the Protestant work ethic is something very special That 's the danger \n\n<$E> The uh house that I have here would cost three or four times as much in England Uh I 'd probably be commuting forty fifty miles to a job, whereas here it 's just from Bangor to Belfast I think it 's a much better lifestyle over here\n<$A> The middle range now is from about a hundred to a hundred and fifty thousand But two hundred thousand uh now is quite uh uh quite, I wouldn't say normal, but it is it is more frequent than it used to be Uh in fact I would say that uh very shortly we 'll be in the half million pound property market here, which is something which I wouldn't have anticipated uh eighteen months ago\n<$F> Well the obvious one is the friendliness of people Then there 's the overall quality, the quality of housing the quality of, leisure activities such as this Over this past twenty odd years we 've shown the downside of Northern Ireland We haven't mentioned the education system We haven't mentioned the grammar schools\n<$A> Good schools but there are good schools throughout Northern Ireland anyway but particularly there are some nice schools down here Uh but all in all there is that thing called quality of life where people move with relative uh freedom Uh their they they enjoy the camaraderie Uh there is a great uh uh professional basis here, a good business basis here, and and people just enjoy living here\n\n<$B> I think everybody in Ireland is concerned about the trouble and concerned about the violence Uh  seeing that actually translated into action uhm amongst uh I think middle-class, middle-class Protestants if you like uh, most of them are  prepared to uh wring their hands and let other people do the work\n<$G> Uh some of them have opted out of this whole question altogether and have simply decided to look after themselves their businesses and their families, maybe also their churches, uh and and their horizons are have therefore been drawn in to something which is uh which is personal family business perhaps church Uh but I think you have got to do more than that You have a Christian responsibility to go beyond that\n<$D> I think they 're slightly more understanding of the problems but on the other hand I don't they 're confronting the problems I think the as long as they think of themselves as business and professional, as long as they are making their contribution by creating employment or indeed making money, and living as stable citizens, I think that ends their particular responsibility\n\n<$G> The Presbyterian middle classes in North Belfast uh are a part of a wider grouping of people Now that wider grouping of people which is the the Protestant community needs reassurances because it it understands itself or experiences itself as a very insecure community Uh and a lot of its I think its intransigence in politics for example is rooted in insecurity rather than in arrogance Uh therefore they do need uh reassurances Now some people find that very hard to believe because when when that community is looked at from the outside it looks as a very self-confident strong community But in fact it is in my experience not self-confident and strong at all\n<$H> The Unionist community uh uh is manifesting its lack of confidence by uh happily sending their children over to university on the mainland and uh contemplating them taking up their futures there, and certainly making no effort to try and make them come back and settle down here And that 's a most debilitating uh  scenario for the whole of of Protestantism and Unionism in the north of Ireland\n\n\n<$I> We don't encourage them in the sense of saying they should go What we do is make information available to them both about the universities in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and elsewhere in Great Britain and we try to be as up-to-date as we can and then they make up their minds And of course a large number of them will choose to stay in Northern Ireland to go to Queen 's or the University of Ulster\n\n<$J> It 's a function of the Northern Ireland siege mentality of people withdrawing into themselves and failing to actually reach out and communicate with their fellow man And that in uh is perhaps you know culturally determined the way that the the the Protestant middle class at the beginning of the Troubles found themselves literally uhm uh dumb before the the the the onslaught before the onslaught of uhm of expression from the Catholic side about civil rights And instead of being able to articulate a point of view and and indeed reach out to people and communicate to them uhm we we saw the Protestant middle class withdraw into itself uhm abandon largely abandon   politics through the seventies and the eighties and uh and therefore leave the Protestant community uhm uh with more extreme uhm articulators of its opinion than would otherwise have been the case leading in turn to a greater polarisation Uhm and if the Protestant middle class had been as articulate as the Catholic middle class had been at the beginning of the Troubles we may well have been able to find some accommodation   between people, some communication between people at a much earlier stage\n\n<$K> The Unionist discourse was fine Uh I think I 've said this earlier it was fine, so long as it was focused on Stormont and Stormont was given a reasonably free hand and the issue was seen to be to some degree settled and could be settled internally And therefore all you needed to do was maintain a degree of Unionist unity and you were the majority and therefore you didn't really have to argue about political ideas The money was coming in from London, things were reasonably secure power, was all you needed to uh to have and they had it\n<$C> What I 'm saying is, that there was no state power Uh, Stormont administered Northern Ireland on behalf of the United Kingdom Government For example uhm, the National Health Service, brought in by the Labour Government, administered in Northern Ireland, the reforms brought about by the nineteen forty-four Education Act and introduced here in forty-seven forty-eight, uh again by a uh Labour, uh Party, nevertheless administered by a Unionist administration that was in national terms very pro-Conservative It is true however, that within the ambit of local government, and really Stormont was just a a super, council, uh there was uh, relatively speaking a tremendous amount of patronage Everything from planning to the appointment of schoolteachers to places in the civil service to jobs in the City Hall and in the local councils, was within the gift, of Unionist administrations And therefore when I talk about them having no power, I 'm talking about state power about major issues In terms of administrative gift and patronage they had a great deal of power\n\n<$K> Once that went in nineteen seventy-two the language of politics changed from uh holding the line to well what are the initiatives  what are the constructive engagements you need to enter into to ensure that violence is eradicated to ensure that there 's a a proper and constructive relationship with uhm uh the Irish Republic and to what extent can you actually show yourselves capable of recognising what the discontent within the British political establishment is and what the needs of the British political establishment is without sort of coming out with your hands up or climbing into the dustbin of history\n<$L> I think Unionists probably are demoralised and that 's bad for, that 's bad for everybody It 's bad for Nationalists as well because, it is uh  we 're talking about a very large number of people, uhm, and we 're talking about people a people whose roots are here and who are part of this society, uhm who have nowhere else to go uhm and who should see their future here It 's demoralising and depressing for everybody But young Protestants, talented young Protestants are leaving in increasing numbers Uhm, it would be it would be good for everybody if if that demoralisation could be could be turned around But I think, a lot of it is an unresolved feeling about the past, that uhm I think many Protestants feel What are we supposed to say Are we supposed to say sorry Are we supposed to say I am guilty, because many don't feel personal guilt\n<$C> I think what you 've got to bear in mind is, that a large section of the Protestant middle class,   were what the, Ulster poet John Hewitt would have called coasters They weren't actively involved, in Unionist politics, but indirectly they got the benefit of a Unionist administration, and they were quite happy to coast along with it, and not direct their minds, to the uh the time bombs, that were ticking away And then when the bombs went off, and they were alerted to it, many of them were able to say well you know I was never in the Unionist Party Uh but their whole psychological sympathy was for the Unionist Party and what went with it Then they suddenly found consciences\n\n<$L> I think part of the problem uh  of politics within Northern Ireland as distinct from anywhere else is that uh politics for too long has been identified with religion, and which side of the fence you you come from So when you 're actually if you decide you want to become involved in politics uh you 've then got a problem of which party do you identify with uh  as distinct from which policies they support And that 's a very difficult thing for a businessman to actually decide on\n\n<$K> What they failed to do I think essentially, throughout the nineteen seventies and most of the nineteen eighties was actually to to re-examine their own propositions which in many cases are sound and uh as we can see uh is happening in sort of Eastern Europe aren't unusual Uhm, I mean that the concerns that they have, has been the failure to try and rearticulate these to re-examine them, and to uh almost reinvent them, to reinvent a Unionist tradition which uh can appeal to the, a  a mainstream of uh intellectual argument in in Britain, Europe, the United States or even throughout the world There has been, a tendency to think that numbers, uh are enough  It  may very well be the case that historians would say that no matter what Unionists would 've had to say there were so many fundamental interests and purposes stacked against them that uh their cause was uh, one that uh couldn't be  sustained or maintained uh in any case But as uh there is that uh lack of trying to imagine even what the other side is thinking or what may even be necessary to do to win allies", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM",

{"text": "<Employment>\n\n\n<$A> They are uh financially comfortable They are better off, than they ever thought they would be They don't feel the sense of being outsiders or being alien that their parents did and their grandparents certainly did\n<$B> For a lot of them they are glad to be out, and they are quite happy to pull the ladder up behind them and leave the area that they that they grew up in\n<$C> And I think the middle classes and who can blame them, are pulling the duvet of the quality of their life round them Every woman 's home is important to her, no matter what class she is I wonder what you think as you look round here and I wonder what conclusions you 're drawing and I wonder what pigeonhole or little box you 're putting me in  There are the people with money, there are the people with education, there are people with education and money, there are people with education and no money, uh there are the acquirers, there are the those who live by, the spirit alone, and there are those who are judicious a mixture of all of those  Indeed it has been Education has been the releasing of an entire generation and the nineteen forty-seven Education Act has meant that particularly the Catholic, element of society has achieved professional status, has achieved, for the first time I suppose in this century, uh the status of middle class, the professional gloss of middle class, in some cases the money of the middle class and all the aspirations that go with that And, I happen to consider that 's a very good thing because it has enriched the life of the entire community\n\n<$B> A number of things have changed First of all, there 's the official awareness of discrimination and the legislation to try to stop that Now that has benefited professional and managerial people more than working-class Catholics They 're aware of what they can do They 're aware of their legal rights And interviews for professional jobs are more precise and technical than for example taking on someone in a in a non-skilled job But also there are new empires that have been created such as the Housing Executive, which began with a level playing-field in nineteen seventy-three And Catholics got in on the ground floor so to speak and have developed with those new empires\n\n<$D> I think there 's a a great big lie being told there And the Protestant work ethic was a nice way of saying that most Protestants were in jobs most Protestants in fact were in business or professions  There 's no special virtue in being a Protestant, uh as it was thought probably by the same misrepresentation that a Catholic was less likely to be as industrious as a Protestant more indolent I mean those are in fact unfortunately, lies told about each community I think Protestants have to accept, there 's no special virtue in being a in a a Protestant when you 're in business, there 's no special virtue in being a Catholic, except I would think that currently since there 's more first-generation Catholics in business and professions they must have what we  termed earlier, a new confidence\n<$E> I think it would be right to say about Direct Rule, that it has had some very very clear benefits And one of its strongest benefits is, that the Catholic middle class, have increasingly, accepted opportunities to participate in the business life, in the quasi-political life I 'm talking about administration and health boards and in education boards, uhm and getting their proper place in the sun And, one of the reasons for this is, that unlike in the past where you would have been described as a Castle Catholic, they do not have to work, necessarily in harmony with a Unionist administration, because the Unionists have no power\n<$B> For a lot of them it 's, it 's quite suitable Uhm it recognises the the validity of their existence They have channels of communication They in many cases don't need the SDLP for those channels of communication They have other bodies like Chambers of Commerce and so on that they can use, or professional bodies which they can use to meet ministers Uh you wouldn't be able to do that in other parts of the UK, but ministers here regularly  regularly meet individuals as parts of professional groups  Well when you say they 're on the other side of the tracks from Andersonstown that 's actually true in in graphic terms They 've moved across the  the motorway and the railway line uh into South Belfast For a lot of them they are glad to be out, and they are quite happy to pull the ladder up behind them and leave the area that they that they grew up in  Certainly when I was growing up in West Belfast there was a mixed community there of uhm people from different backgrounds and professions and so on Now what happens is, there 's a sort of slamming of doors at five thirty pm every day in West Belfast as the teachers the shopkeepers the doctors the social workers all clear out of the place, and go as you say across the tracks to South Belfast or to North Belfast, so that they simply leave They work in the place during the day but they don't put anything back into it And there there is a lot of resentment about these people driving into the areas in the mornings and vanishing in the evening\n\n<$F> Well the church was built for three hundred people and it was built mainly for the domestic staff uh who were occupied here in the houses along the main Malone Road The uh domestic staff who worked in those houses came I think mainly from uh Fermanagh Cavan and Monaghan At that time three hundred would have been the maximum number in the parish It also of course consisted of those who were in what was then called the poorhouse, possibly a hundred and fifty or two hundred residents there as well\n\n<$A> They are more Catholic than you might expect There hasn't been the big dropping away in middle-class Catholic areas uh in Northern Ireland that there has been in Southern Ireland, because it 's been a ghetto church It 's been a ghetto Catholicism It 's been surrounded by a larger and hostile, religious world or so it 's always felt Uhm conservatism has kept them from, from uh dropping away from the church But also there 's a strong attachment to Catholicism as a badge of identity And it 's something that people are are reluctant to to, to drop Uh it means a lot to them And you only have to look at attendance figures in affluent South Belfast compared to attendance figures in Republican West Belfast They are higher I believe in South Belfast uhm, even proportionately  More affluent Catholics are as keen on sending their children to Catholic primary schools as ever they were When it comes to secondary school they 'll they 'll send them quite happily to to Protestant schools for clearly for social and educational reasons because they believe these will be useful, useful places for their kids to go Uhm I think that means that they they 're still they 're bringing their children up as Catholic And I suppose that means that as many of the, their children are likely to turn out to be Catholic as, as as any comparable area\n\n<$B> Well they meet in golf clubs Uhm they go to the same restaurants They behave like middle-class people I mean I think it should always be remembered that people in the north of Ireland are quite normal people But the middle class who have more disposable income here than they would have other in other parts of the UK because of the cheap housing and cheap transport that exists here They can go to golf clubs they can go on holidays, they meet each other they fly on the same package flights Uhm they arrive in Majorca or in uhm Malaga or other parts  of Europe on the same flights from Aldergrove So the surprising places they run into each other and they become friends, because they 've met each other on holidays in in in the Mediterranean\n<$A> I don't think there 's any more warmth towards Protestants among, affluent Catholics among middle-class Catholics than there was among their parents I don't think there is a unified middle class I don't think Catholics and Protestants who live side by side on a on a pleasant middle-class street are necessarily much closer together I don't think they talk about the difficult issues I don't think they want to And more and more the Catholic who moves into an affluent area is aware that the Protestants there are moving out There 's uh the beginning of some sense among uh Catholics who move into what were mixed areas that it isn't going to be a mixed area any more and that in a sense their own success and their own upward mobility has torpedoed what they saw as the solution for them personally uhm that they would be living in a in a mixed area There 's a, a mutual feeling of distrust there Uhm the Catholic feels resentment, it seems to me that the Protestants are moving out The Protestants feel resentment that the Catholics are moving in Neither can admit, to each other certainly what their real feelings about that are\n<$C> There has been a great silence among a high percentage of the Protestant middle classes, as to what they wish and feel The Catholic, middle class if it is to speak out with a voice of courage must at the very least be matched, by those on the other side Something as simple as the setting up, by the BBC of what was destined to be a community radio station in this area, which was funded generously , created a wide appeal, failed to attract the number of Protestant contributors to make it identifiable as a truly cross-community entity Why was that I worked there in a freelance capacity I made programmes on business I made programmes on writing I made programmes on everything from psycho-kinesis to the eleven plus I rang every articulate person in Derry that I could think of, right across the board How often how often did I get a polite, No, a genteel brush-off, I 'd prefer not to thank-you, from the very people whose input would have been so valuable, in creating a climate of change in this little pocket of the Northwest There is something about the Protestant middle classes that does not wish, to peek over the wall in case what they see might prove too uncomfortable for them\n\n<$E> Both middle classes have heavily involved themselves in what I would call charitable and do-gooding works, because these are non-confrontational areas, with objectives that are good by any absolute standard Uh the areas for confrontation in backing cystic fibrosis or uh or, organising new equipment for the various hospitals or any of the other charitable works uhm enable the middle classes to uhm, uh work together in non-confrontational circumstances and persuade themselves that they are engaged in valuable, community work without getting themselves in that nasty and distasteful business called politics And insofar as they want to get involved in politics, they want to sup at it with an extraordinarily long and very antiseptic spoon", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "42a63253-6b90-4a59-b173-18918307c910", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.413725+00:00"}
{"text": "<John Cole>\n\n\n<$A> The first time I ever remember coming to Portrush I must have been probably about seven in nineteen thirty-five or thereabouts And it really was a magical experience We came as a family the four of us my father and mother and elder brother and myself  When we approached Portrush in my father 's old Fiat car, my brother and I on the back seat used to compete with each other as to who could see the sea first, and then we would come over the crest of a hill and there spread out before us would be the Atlantic with the sun sparkling on it The sun always seemed to shine when I was young I think everybody finds it never seemed to rain when they were children Portrush for me is about memory, a sort of a recollection of happiness and youth \n<$A> In the thirties we stayed in a boarding house in Kerr Street run by a lady called Mrs Grossie It was what in these more grandiloquent days you would call a private hotel My mother regarded my brother and myself as rather picky or fussy eaters She had a terrible trouble getting us to eat what she thought we ought to eat So uh, in the apartment set-up she bought the food, bought what we liked, what she could make us eat in effect, and the landlady cooked it I I think I was quite a shy boy in those days at least so people tell me So whatever brashness I may have developed is a later fruit I suppose of the hard world of journalism  I came here first I suppose when I was about, five or six or so and this was called in those pre-sexism days the ladies ' bathing place That 's what it called it in the old postcards but it wasn't only ladies it was uh children as well and also non-swimming men like my father But the climate up here is, very nice today but shall we say fitful, and it could be very cold So after my brother and I came out from a bathe here and  frolicking around in the waves, my mother would sort of get on our jerseys and send us out to the longer beach across this way and say Now go go for a good long run and get yourselves warmed up again and I 'll have hot chocolate ready for you when you come back And that was the sort of incentive to go in for a bathe because we were sometimes a little reluctant That area round the arcadia is a kind of a natural social centre It 's a bit of an amphitheatre Uh parents with young children it 's a natural place for them to bring them with a little pool for them to sail their boats and a fairly safe place for them to bathe The older people are there sitting on the benches taking in whatever sun there may be, chatting to their cronies, occasionally pursing their lips at the follies of youth All the time I meet people that I know Uh and it 's very nice to hear what 's happened to them in the interim People are very open here  I used to come up here to take part in the tennis tournament They 'd a very good tennis tournament And we combine tennis with uh, social life girlfriends and the rest of it And I met my wife here I 'd known her slightly before but we teamed up while up here and you know had a lot of fun on the beach and the dances and things, the kind of things that uh young people did at the time Nineteen forty-five was a very crucial for year for me as for many other people It was the year when I was due to get my results from what was the equivalent then of A-levels And I was with my parents and went up from the beach to make a telephone call to the school to find out how I 'd done in these exams And the results were alright but on the way back down I saw a newspaper billboard which said, Atomic bomb dropped on Japan And uh I came down and my father said Well what were the results like and I said oh they 're alright but uh what 's an atomic bomb And he said he 'd never heard of it The general public including ourselves knew nothing about atomic weapons at that stage, so it came like a bolt from the blue The school results led onto the career in journalism And the dropping of that bomb, and the consequences of it for, uh international affairs has been the backdrop of the whole of my, forty-five forty-six years in journalism I 've always been very fond of the sea having been brought up in Belfast, on the north side of Belfast, you 're always in sight of Belfast Lough But but I 've always felt slightly uncomfortable when I 'm living too far from the sea Even, my present, way of life at Westminster when I 'm walking across the bridge in the mornings if I come in by train, I tend to look down the river to where, the outside world begins because I  feel that in cities you 're somewhat, cabined and confined, whereas if you 've got access to the sea, it sort of opens your mind and your imagination August on the north coast of Ireland is really my great break from Westminster Parliament usually rises at the end of July, the party conferences begin again in September so there 's this oasis And I try to use it not only for physical refreshment but we pack a, a big cardboard box of books into the boot of the car We never get through them all here but at least it gives you some chance for intellectual as well as physical refreshment  These beauteous forms, through a long absence have not been to me as is a landscape to a blind man 's eye, but oft in lonely rooms and mid the din of towns and cities I have owed to them in hours of weariness, sensation sweet, felt in the blood and felt along the heart, and passing even into my purer mind with tranquil restoration  Well that was Wordsworth, and for my money the greatest poet of nature talking about how he escaped very different places This for me these beaches these headlands these waves are the escape from the ordinary world of Westminster Just like to come up here and walk and read a bit, and think I mean as I 've grown older, I 've become more interested in nature And I do like this rugged kind of, tortured scenery, that gives you some sense of having been here forever You have a great sense of the elements here, and of eternity, I suppose it must be the Puritan in me but I 've always seen some kind of merit in swimming in cold water I enjoy coming down here because, there 's a sort of physicality about the sea and about these kind of rockwaters that we have around this north coast of Ireland I had uh, major heart surgery about seven years ago, a a coronary artery bypass And I think that what swimming in this kind of sea does for me is that it, convinces me that I 've still got some of my youth left and a certain amount of survivability And although one has occasional doubts about the state of one 's health, I think throwing yourself into a cold sea which obviously I know won't do me any harm, but I think it does sort of make you realise that you can do things you  did when you were, young and I 'm lucky enough to be doing it in the same kind of place that I did it when I was young And I suppose the swimming in the sea is a kind of a personal, testimony to myself Well that was very nice It 's actually much warmer than it looks I suppose my ludicrous self-image is that of Chairman Mao, who at the age of about eighty used to swim across the Yangtze I don't know whether I 'll still be doing him out when I 'm eighty but I 'm enjoying it in the meantime  Portrush for me is about memory I mean I 'm enough of a Freudian to think that, what happens to you in early childhood does influence your attitude to life And I think it was the kind of family life I had and the kind of holidays associated with it that make me on the whole, I wouldn't say a wholly optimistic person but a basically happy person", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "b6dd7814-9e83-4d83-b2d4-f022aaff74ca", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.414612+00:00"}
{"text": "<Statues>\n\n\n<$A> Hello Like our languages, our literatures and the games we play, the public statues and monumental sculpture of Ireland constitute an important aspect of our cultural expression The statues themselves, the figures they represent, the sculptors who made them, the locations chosen for them, and the acclaim or outrage with which they were received, all have important stories to tell In this programme we 'll take a closer look at these silent reminders of times past\n\n<$B> Behind me is an unusual view of Daniel O'Connell, not the sort of view that one normally sees And we must consider when looking at this monument that the streets of Dublin are peopled with such statues Now how many of the public actually look at these statues Have they simply become furnishings on the streets, or do people actually explore them, as they walk around doing their daily activities What we propose to do in this programme, is to explore some of these monuments in terms of Irishness in Irish art  The taste for public monuments was considered to have broken out into a statue monument memorial mania in the nineteenth century If the Greeks were the first to confer statues as a mark of honour, the silent statuesque portraits erected in the nineteenth century in Dublin, might be considered evidence of the nation 's triumphs and tragedies At the beginning of the century there were few public monuments Those that were in place, mainly depicted royalty, and several amongst them were portraits of an equestrian nature, The most prominent public sculpture in Dublin at the beginning of the nineteenth century, was here in College Green Tell us about it,\n<$C> Well the equestrian monument of William the Third was erected in seventeen o-one, having been executed by the English sculptor Grinling Gibbons And, it would have, looked in seventeen o- one what you would have seen was, William the Third seated on his horse dressed in imperial Roman, military costume Now this shows that it 's in a direct line back to the, equestrian monuments of ancient Rome, and it was here that the symbolism for majesty and power and authority was established with the use of the equestrian monument to depict the emperors and then subsequently placed throughout the empire\n<$B> And, what was the significance of this type of monument for the Irish people\n<$C> Well, in being placed in Dublin though of course using a very foreign style if you like at the same time would have been an instantly recognisable, convention if you like for the depiction of unquestionable majesty and authority\n<$B> And were there any other equestrian monuments I know this was an eighteenth century one but did any go up in the nineteenth century\n<$C> Well probably the best known would have been the Gough monument, in the Phoenix Park which was erected in eighteen eighty and had been executed by the London-based Irish sculptor John Henry Foley Now there was several attempts as there had been with William the Third to destroy this monument and it was finally removed in nineteen fifty-seven\n<$B> So these monuments uh the equestrian monument we can expect to be a controversial monument\n<$C> Well I think so because William the Third here in Dame Street became a a focus for political uhm processions, became a political rallying point basically both for those that uhm supported the whole concept that this was there to illustrate\n<$B> Yes\n<$C> And those that\n<$B> Yes\n<$C> Opposed it   pretty vehemently \n<$B>  And certainly   not the sort of monument  we 're going to expect to find on the streets in the twentieth century\n<$C> No I don't think so \n<$B> The execution of the Wellington monument was more problematic, long drawn out as it was and perhaps even today it cannot be considered entirely complete The obelisk, erected in the early part of the century, was to have been accompanied by an equestrian portrait, and the pedestal was in place to receive it However, there was never sufficient money, to commission the statue, and so the pedestal was removed, before the unveiling ceremony which did not take place until eighteen sixty-one The Nelson and Wellington monuments rising to a soaring height in the city, employed scale, in a manner which must have appeared to many, as aggressive,\nCollege Green along with Sackville Street was a focal point for sculptural work in the nineteenth century And when the Grattan statue was first mooted for this location, it was considered problematic that it might be as they said dwarfed into a pygmy by the equestrian monument to William the Third However, there were those who thought it much more significant that Grattan would be standing positioned with his back to his royal majesty This site was also problematic because it had been intended for a statue to Prince Albert but that particular statue was slow in coming to fruition so the Corporation was gently if firmly persuaded to hand over the location to the Grattan Committee Queen Victoria is said to have been displeased and the Prince Albert memorial was positioned instead in Leinster Lawn The Grattan statue is the work of John Henry Foley and it accompanies two other works by this Irish sculptor who was based in London These two monuments are in front of Trinity College and are statues of Goldsmith and of Burke  Goldsmith was not the first Irish poet commemorated on the streets of Dublin Tom Moore the Nationalist balladeer can claim that particular prize The decision to erect a statue to Moore shortly after he died in eighteen fifty-two was greeted with enthusiasm, as this would be the first significantly Irish public commemoration However when the statue was unveiled in College Green in eighteen fifty-seven, there followed general public outcry The sculptural portrait was not liked It was described as a stigma on our streets Letters to the newspapers called for its removal Even today it is criticised The committee was considered to have made the wrong choice when they selected Christopher Moore to execute the work A sketch model had been submitted by the eminent John Hogan and this design was generally considered to have been more successful Yet if we examine the two, the Hogan is a studied exercise in lyricism, a contrived presentation of a poet, while the Moore bronze has a certain solid down-to-earth friendliness Certainly Joyce 's comment on the aptness of placing a portrait likeness of Tom Moore over a urinal, because of his ballad on the meeting of the waters, would not have seemed appropriate to the daintiness of the Hogan design Nonetheless, with every subsequent commission for a street monument, committees were reminded, of what had happened here in College Green Moore was joined in this location by Goldsmith and Burke, fellow graduates of Trinity College, in the eighteen sixties However none of these statues was considered adequately powerful in Nationalist terms, and it was deemed outrageous that Dublin still had no public monument to Daniel O'Connell, This was the first politically Nationalist monument commissioned for Dublin in the nineteenth century and has to have been the most controversial, particularly because of the choice of sculptor The Irish people wanted a resident local sculptor to get the commission and Thomas Farrell was the name most often mooted, but the committee decided instead to put the commission out to competition The competition was advertised not just in the Irish newspapers but also in England and in Scotland, a fact that worried those who insisted that the commission be given to a resident Irish sculptor The closing date for the submission of designs was January the first eighteen sixty-five, and of the sixty designs submitted, and exhibited in the City Hall, amongst which triumphal arches and gothic canopies, none was deemed acceptable A further competition was held, with exactly the same result At which stage the committee decided to offer the commission directly to John Henry Foley, whom they had really always wanted to execute the monument Foley, was an Irish sculptor who had trained initially in Dublin before going for further training to London in eighteen thirty-four and eventually setting up his studio there Foley was considered therefore by some to have, as they put it, succumbed to the blandishments of Babylon, and certainly the choice of this sculptor for such an important work in Dublin revealed, a lack of confidence in local talent Although this monument was not erected in Dublin until eighteen eighty-two, Foley exhibited a sketch model of the work in the City Hall in eighteen sixty-seven He had chosen a three-tiered monument with the heroic figure, atop a drum and four victory figures at the base Now it is in the drum area that Foley has chosen to reveal O'Connell 's interrelationship with the people of Ireland And if we examine the drum we find the figure of Erin in the centre with the detail of shamrocks in her hair as she tramples upon the chains with which she had been bound and holds in her hand the Act of Catholic Emancipation pointing aloft to O'Connell the Liberator And approaching the figure of Erin around the drum we find members of the community, a variety of different people brought together from, peasant through lawyer to poet uh all of these people gathered together, walking forward around the drum approaching this significant figure It is interesting to note that in this particular area, apart obviously from the figure of Erin, there are actually no women included This use of relief figures on a drum, was to influence Thomas Farrell, in one of the great Catholic Church commissions of the century, the statue commemorating the first Irish cardinal Paul Cullen in the Pro-Cathedral Here, the figure of religion, takes the place of that of Erin Even more politically Nationalist than the O'Connell monument was the decision to commemorate William Smith O'Brien in eighteen sixty-seven This statue was originally located on the far side of O'Connell Bridge, and although commissioned after the O'Connell monument, it was complete and in position some ten years earlier than the Foley work It was a controversial work uh because of the particular type of politics espoused by Smith O'Brien, and the unveiling ceremony which was a huge public affair was peppered with fiery speeches John Martin a staunch supporter of Smith O'Brien and the man who performed the unveiling ceremony, drew attention to the fact that the monuments on the streets of Dublin, tended to reflect the haughty mastery of the English people And he admired the fact that now finally we were getting somebody who was going to be of more significance to the Irish people and that also it would be the work of a resident Irish sculptor in this case Thomas Farrell While there was a delay in the execution of the O'Connell monument, and, Smith O'Brien was positioned on the other side of the Liffey, it was Sir John Gray who was first to join Nelson in O'Connell Street This type of presentation with the portrait statue set on a pedestal, brought the image much closer to the people than Nelson who was no more than a distant symbol skyed atop his pillar Gray was the proprietor of the Freeman 's Journal, and a Protestant supporter of the Nationalists, and he was also the driving force behind the Vartry scheme which made drinking water more available for the people of Dublin And it was for this public duty spiritedly undertaken, while also for his political motivation, that he was given, such a prominent location in Dublin This leads to what I like to call the do-gooder commemorations of the nature of Lord Ardilaun, whose elegant bronze likeness is positioned in Saint Stephen 's Green, Now why is he here Because he was instrumental in having the Green opened to the public Sir Benjamin Guinness seated outside Saint Patrick 's Cathedral is a statue of a similar nature, He is in this particular location because he had contributed so much money to the restoration fund In the garden of Saint Patrick 's Cathedral there is another public work, Liberty Bell, by, Vivienne Roche", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "258f5f50-b161-472f-b636-be79b49fef2a", "added":

{"text": "<Folklore>\n\n\n<$A> Hello and welcome to the continuing story of Irish expression In our programmes up to now, we 've been concentrating on language, and on the linguistic history of Ireland From now on however we 'll be widening the focus a little to include other areas of cultural expression In this programme which we call the folk imagination we 'll be looking at Irish folklore and later on I 'll be talking to Da/ithi O/ hO/ga/in who 'll be discussing the particular role played by folk narrative or storytelling in Irish society The word folklore conjures up many images to many people, romantic tales of times past, close encounters with the supernatural, improbable superstitions and old wives ' tales But we might be hard pushed to provide an adequate definition of the word What exactly is folklore, and what do academic folklorists study We asked Se/amus O/ Catha/in of the Department of Irish Folklore in University College Dublin\n\n<$B> We 're in the Archive of the Department of Irish Folklore at University College Dublin, and here on its shelves you see arranged, the bound manuscripts containing the nuts and bolts of Irish folk tradition You might well ask what do you mean by folklore and indeed we are often asked exactly that question The answer we usually give is that, folklore is defined by everything that is contained, in the handbook of Irish folklore written by Sea/n O/ Su/illeabha/in and published in nineteen forty-two It 's a bit long the definition because it runs to some six hundred and ninety-nine pages It covers fourteen chapter headings with names like, settlement and dwelling, livelihood and household support, communication and trade, nature, folk medicine, mythological tradition, historical tradition, religious tradition, sports and pastimes and much else besides Now the handbook actually describes in a kind of summarised form what is contained in the manuscripts, and I want to show you just a small selection of some of that material Here for example, is a manuscript, from County Galway  this manuscript is contains a description in the English language, of, various things to do with fishing and boats the parts of them and the names for them, Another manuscript here, this one from County Cork and, in the Irish language, contains, uh the words of a song here just a little verse of a song in English on this occasion, in the middle of this Irish-language account, This manuscript up here, is from the Barony of Erris in northwest County Mayo and, here you see, a picture of a spinning wheel, with all the various parts named numbered and named and the volume contains copious accounts of, the tradition of weaving in that part of Ireland and, taken down from the weavers who survived, up until the forties and fifties of this century, This is another manuscript here dealing with yet another aspect of Irish folk tradition This one in fact describes, uh from County Galway again describes uh uh various aspects of, the tradition relating to agriculture in Ireland and also it describes a great deal of the folk cures from that part of Ireland And from folk cures we go to children 's games This manuscript is, again from County Cork was taken down by a Cork child, in the nineteen seventies and here she describes the games, that she played and her, companions played at that time, and with  gives copious illustrations, of, how the games were played and descriptions word pictures also of how it was done This manuscript here, is in fact not a manuscript at all it 's really, a typescript As you can see, it contains typewritten material, and it comes from, the northern part of Ireland We 're looking at material in these pages from County Cavan, and also here from County Down, and from County Armagh So that the tradition that was recorded by, the kind of people who, wrote these manuscripts or typed them up, uh covers the whole island of Ireland north and south Well that little sample may have given you some idea of what the scope and range of Irish folk tradition, uh was and indeed to some extent still is These accounts and were taken down from people, all over Ireland as I said They were taken down by a variety of individuals, full-time collectors, part-time collectors, questionnaire correspondents and so on and so forth Now they would have sat around the hearth with the people, that they recorded their material from, and I often think of the hearth as being central to the whole to an understanding of what Irish folk tradition in its totality is about, because on the one side you have the materials of uh the material, tradition as it were, the material folk tradition, the pots and pans, the hearth furniture, the chimney, the fire, the fuels and so on and so forth, all of that On the other hand, you have, the people sitting on their chairs around the hearth doing what people, did, talking to each other, describing times gone by, singing songs, and of course, perhaps uh what is one of the greatest glories of the Irish folk tradition uh uh participating in what we folklorists call folk narrative, storytelling in other words,\n\n<$C> For most of us nowadays, our contact with Irish folklore is through the bookshop, through the finely illustrated books, that we find there But in fact these stories were once told throughout the whole community, by the old people to the young people, by the young people to each other, by word of mouth The most celebrated character of all was Fionn mac Cumhaill, a hero well suited to the Irish temperament, for we are told that not only was he a great warrior, but he was also a very imaginative, and a very clever man, The main divisions of folk stories in Ireland, are native hero tales, adaptations of international folktales, and legends of famous persons and things\n<$X>  <&Irish> <unclear> 4 sylls </unclear> A ra/ le aifreann a le/amh Ta/im </&Irish> \n\n<$C> As well as these, shorter forms of narrative have been much cultivated, such as jokes, verse anecdotes, and accounts of personal experiences\n<$X>  <&Irish> <unclear> 8 sylls </unclear> thall thoir <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> </&Irish> \n<$Y>  <&Irish> Bhuel bhi/ ri/ ann

extent in English as in Irish\n<$X>  And <&Irish> bhuel bhi/ fear amha/in <unclear> 7 sylls </unclear> </&Irish> \n<$C> Due to the influence of commercial entertainment and the mass media, recent generations have evidenced a marked decline in all forms of oral storytelling, except for modern urban legends and a variety of short and rather spontaneous humorous accounts Few of the mythical stories of old Irish literature, are found in the folklore of recent centuries But there are some significant exceptions Especially notable is the lore concerning the young hero Lugh who survives the schemes of his tyrant grandfather Balar of the Destructive Eye and slays that formidable opponent This epical story can be proved to have evolved from ancient sources in the Middle East, where the Celts picked it up and applied it to their god Lugus It can still be heard told in the north and west of Ireland Other divine personages with vestiges surviving in folklore until recent times, are the smith god Goibhniu, who is popularly known as the Goba/n Saor, and land goddesses such The Hag of Beare, <&Irish> Cailleach Bhe/ara </&Irish> whom we are told lived longer than any other person As well as fairy queens such as A/ine who reside in wonderful palaces inside some hill or other, People everywhere love stories of great heroes In Ireland our hero tales have been reinforced through the centuries by written texts This is true of all versions of stories from the Ulster Cycle or <&Irish> Rudhraighi/ocht </&Irish> which have been current in folklore Their sources were manuscript retellings which are read out at get-togethers in the evenings Most popular of these stories are descriptions of the youthful deeds of Cu/ Chulainn, and of the tragic life of the heroine Deirdre, who is deprived of her true love and made to marry the vengeful king Conchubhar Mac Neasa instead Folk accounts of Fionn mac Cumhaill are much more common, partly because of the simple and catchy form of his adventures, and also because of the large number of late literary texts which focus on him and his warriors The account of his fugitive youth, and of how he gained prophetic wisdom, through tasting a salmon, was known to Irish speakers in every part of the country Another widely-known story, tells of an adventure which he and some of his warriors had in a strange house where they encountered, time in the person of an old man, youth as a beautiful maiden, and energy in the form of an aggressive ram Despite his great knowledge, Fionn was puzzled, until all was explained to him This story closely resembles the literary allegories which scholars were so fond of in medieval Europe That the ordinary people in Ireland appreciated its meaning and developed the characterisation in it, shows that the popular imagination, can be quite sophisticated Of other epical heroes the most striking is Conall Gulban, an important figure of early history whose name and fame were borrowed into a fantastic romance written in or about the sixteenth century This has Conall 's lady love being stolen away from him when he falls asleep on the hill of Howth He sets out to sea to search for her and, after travelling much of the world, and fighting many battles, he returns home to Ireland in triumph Though highly anachronistic it was avidly adopted from manuscript readings by oral tellers, and these storytellers streamlined the episodes, and re-arranged the plot as they themselves saw fit Many stories have come in to Ireland from abroad, having been brought here by sailors, merchants, missionaries, and many other types of people who had business on the Continent and in Britain Since these stories, had good plots, and since they were full of fantasy and imagination they soon caught on in Irish folklore and became very popular among the people We know these stories as international folktales One very popular genre, was the short animal tale, which attributes fanciful experiences and often human-like intelligence to the various creatures Some of these tales were aetiological, such as how the wren became king of the birds, or how the plaice got its crooked mouth, but especially popular, were the imagined deeds of the clever fox\n<$Z>  <&Irish> Bhi/ ri/ in E/irinn fado/ in e/ fhe/in is a bhanri/on Is mac amha/in a bhi/ acu Bhuel ni/ raibh di/omhaointeas maith arsan mhic <unclear> 6 sylls </unclear> </&Irish> \n\n<$C> Wonder tales were in great demand all over the world and they were very popular with Irish storytellers and their audiences These narratives were long and elaborate, telling of fantastic events in a world of long ago, where the ordinary confines of nature were superseded They were told with great gusto, for instance, the dragonslayer who rescues a princess and upstages his dishonest rival, or the widow 's son who can only save a princess from a giant by finding out where the giant 's heart resides outside of his body  Versions of international religious tales tell of adventures in search of salvation, of tussles with demons and of various other ways in which man acts out his moral dilemma in concrete terms There are many artistic touches to these, such as a man who does penance in a river, and his tears of remorse are so bitter that they cut their way through the water and leave holes in the bed of the river beneath Romantic tales, also of international origin, relate circumstances of coincidence and quick wit in real-life situations, while a wide range of humorous anecdotes were told about tricksters and rogues, about stupid characters who weren't always so stupid, and especially, about how Fortune could turn and smile upon the poor and oppressed, An oral legend is a story to which a strong amount of belief is attached Some stories of this kind, the migratory legends, were told in other parts of Europe as well as here Examples are the legend of a river which claims a victim at periodic intervals, or that of a sleeping army of old, which waits at a hidden location for the appropriate time to return", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "e1706b57-2501-431f-843f-363fe8435e15",

{"text": "<Literature>\n\n\n<$A> Hello An essential component in, the story of Irish expression is the literature produced in this country in the various languages spoken and written here over the centuries For this programme, which we 've entitled A Quilt of Many Patches I 'm joined by Declan Kiberd who is a lecturer in Anglo-Irish literature, yet one I think who is profoundly suspicious of the very term Anglo-Irish literature Am I right in saying this Declan\n<$B> Well yes indeed, I feel about Anglo-Irish literature a little bit the way the Soviet leader Lenin said he felt about theology, that sometimes it seemed a subject without an object Uhm the term obviously comes from the, Anglo-Irish Ascendancy class in Ireland, who indeed in say the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth century were the main writers of literature in English on the island But it 's highly problematic, in the nineteenth and twentieth century, clearly ridiculous to describe figures like, Brendan Behan or Seamus Heaney who had nothing whatsoever to do with, the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy So we really do need another term The problem is if we use a term like Irish Literature  we have to ask where does that leave writing in the Irish language Are we sort of appropriating writing in English for Ireland, which would be a very incorrect thing to do, arguably as racist a mistake as the mistake of calling all Irish writing in English Anglo-Irish So in a way it seems to me to try and get to understand the subject and what it is, Irish writing in English, we 've got to look at all the labels, realising that in a way any label is a barbarism It 's going to be leaving out things as well as letting things in But if we could find a more ecumenical term that wasn't banal, I think it would be better The problem for me with Anglo-Irish, apart from these other questions I 've raised, is that it also, feeds the notion that, Anglo-Irish literature is in some strange way an exotic offshoot, of the English Literature department and the main uh plant from which it derived And I think that impoverishes our understanding of the ways in which writing in Ireland, has much in common with the writings of many other peoples in other parts of the world like India, Africa and Latin America who 've gone through the whole process of colonisation and decolonisation and with whom we 've everything in common And I think it would be much more intelligent to study our writings alongside theirs, rather than alongside the great tradition of Jane Austen and imperial England So, uhm this polemical piece I 've put together is really a sort of exploration, along those lines uhm uh a looking at each term and a search for a better one\n\n<$B> To the famous claim that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world, the English writer W H Auden sarcastically replied,  Such a description would better fit the secret police  In Ireland however, we do things a bit differently James Joyce vowed that he would  forge the uncreated conscience of my race , no less, and a contemporary poet such as Seamus Heaney, can hardly appear on television without being asked if he has a solution to the Northern Ireland question, a solution be it added, which has eluded some of the world 's most ingenious politicians for almost a century now And yet there isn't anything terribly strained or ludicrous, about these connections, between politics and poetry Our State after all, was founded, by a group of poets and playwrights in the building behind me, the General Post Office in Dublin, over seventy-five years ago, and in its early days that State asked W B Yeats to head up the committee redesigning its coinage In our own time our banknotes bear likenesses of many writers such as Swift, such as Yeats himself, Under the Brehon laws of ancient Ireland, the <&Irish> file </&Irish> or poet, doubled as a <&Irish> breitheamh </&Irish> or judge, and he was second only to the chieftain in the political pecking order He was his leader 's chief adviser, and primary publicist, combining the merchandising opportunism of the ad man with the political guile of a government press secretary He counselled on war and peace, he named the warrior dead in elegies The English occupiers of Ireland, sensing the power of these poets, saw them as enemies to be exterminated The Elizabethan English poet Edmund Spenser, saw to it that Gaelic manuscripts of Munster were cut into little squares to make covers for English language text books  The speech being Irish , he remarked tersely,  the heart needs must be Irish  Well Irish literature has in consequence a bit of a labelling problem, not so much an identity but an identification problem The three centuries between the sixteen hundreds and the nineteen hundreds witnessed the decay of the Irish language and the emergence of an Anglo-Irish tradition But this tradition passed, like the writings of so many emerging English-speaking peoples through a colonial, and then a semi-indigenous, and finally a national phase The more debilitated, Irish became, the more did Irish writing in English feed parasite-like, off its ebbing energy The very richness of Hiberno-English is due in large measure to a Gaelic substratum of syntax and of imagery, In the Dublin of Jonathan Swift, one third of the city was still Irish-speaking, but the changeover to English was happening so rapidly that many people continued to think in Irish while using English words Swift noted with great interest the spread of Gaelic loanwords among country squires A word for instance like \" spalpeen \", which means a travelling  journeyman or a labourer, the kind of person into whom many of the Gaelic poets had turned In his famous dialogue in Hybernian Stile Swift noted the use of many Gaelic phrases carried over into English, \" I wonder what is gone with them \", meaning I wonder what has happened to them, In the colonial period that followed, English books were seen, not just as story entertainments, but as etiquette manuals, which could teach unruly natives how to live So people read Jane Austen not just for pleasure, but to study the art of deportment, of correct speech and so on Austen when she wrote, did so in the knowledge that the values she admired were also embodied in the judiciary, the church, the government of England and so forth But an Irish writer living under English occupation had no such assurance Literature was the one remaining institution which kept the ideal of a renovated Irish nation alive Yet these writers also learned to use texts as blueprints for a remodelled community, for an underground nation, for a Utopian ideal It was indeed an awesome responsibility It followed that Irish writers showed scant interest in making realistic portrayals of an environment which they really felt they should be contesting Hence their love of fantasy, of magical effects, of surreal exaggeration And yet their soaring imaginations never quite lost touch with the actual Living in two cultures, Irish and English, for the price of one, kept them alert and it kept them ironical It gave them a love of wit and of wordplay, and an ironic distrust of all simple labels, Swift admired this new linguistic resourcefulness of the Hiberno-English dialect, but he realised that it might be sneered at in England as a deviation from the human, ie the English norm This is why all his writings are so obsessed with the difference between official and unofficial culture and why he seems at times more interested in ways of seeing, than in the things seen So for instance in Gulliver 's Travels, you have a tremendous contrast set up between the massive Brobdingnagians on the one hand and the pygmy-like Lilliputians on the other, giving us a sense of how tremendously precarious really is anybody 's hold on a culture Now, this was to be of course a feature of all Anglo-Irish writing, this, ability of the writer to take a stand outside the culture, and to look at man and woman as if they were almost inhuman witnesses of themselves Now in the eighteenth century the Ireland of Swift and Goldsmith was, often seen as a place of elegance We still look at it like that today The exterior serenity, the show of serenity put on by the Anglo-Irish, was particularly notable in their architecture When you look at Gandon 's Custom House you 're looking at a building, done by a man who literally wanted to build for eternity, but this confidence could never mask an inner sort of insecurity The Protestant Ascendancy held power but they were only one fifth of the population, constantly in jeopardy It would be no, exaggeration of language to say that in a sense the Protestant Ascendancy were, the first Provisionals Uhm Edmund Burke who actually called them a junto of robbers was if you like obsessed as a result by a kind of split in his own personality, between on the one hand, the Irish Burke if you like who sympathised with those who had to live in a revolutionary situation, and on the other hand the English Burke who had a love of order justice and decorum Uhm this is why of course he understood revolutionary France so well He saw it really as a metaphor for the, very discontented Ireland in which he had grown up Well, Swift wanted to facilitate a much smoother relation between England and Ireland in, his writings, but we know from experience that he like all the Anglo-Irish, felt increasingly an Irish person in England and an English person in Ireland, part of a spiritually, hyphenated people, And it was inevitable under these strains, that all of these writers, would eventually veer towards the Irish rather than the English end of the spectrum Edmund Burke saw a similar significance, in Grattan 's Parliament of seventeen eighty-two, of which Burke wrote,  as the English in Ireland began to be domiciliated, they began also to recollect that they had a country , Two generations later another Trinity graduate, Thomas Davis, would recycle that famous phrase In a speech to Trinity 's Historical Society he told his fellow students,  gentlemen you have a country  Before his early death Davis became famous as the author of many patriotic ballads, such as A Nation Once Again For all that verbiage, deriving from English Romantic kitsch, these ballads provided the basis of a popular Nationalist culture They make Davis representative of the second phase in Irish writing, the moment when writing in English becomes semi-indigenous National in content, but still addressing itself in English forms to English liberal wellwishers whose consciences might yet be stirred And this illustrates one of the great paradoxes of nineteenth-century Irish nationalism Its message might be Irish but it was always encased in English People had to learn English if they were to defend themselves in court, or if they were to write threatening letters to their landlords The situation of the native language was dire indeed It would only be redeemed, in eighteen ninety-three with the foundation of the Gaelic League, by Douglas Hyde, yet another Trinity graduate And with that movement, went a literary movement led by Yeats for what Yeats himself called the de-Davisation of Irish literature This was indeed the beginning of the third phase, the moment when forms as well as themes would become Irish indeed A flood of translations from Irish, now overwhelmed the book shelves, none more influential than the epic story of Cuchulain, the ancient hero who defended the north single-handed Intended by the first translator Standish O'Grady as a role model for the demoralised Anglo-Irish aristocracy still reeling from the Land War, Cu/ Chulainn was instead adopted as an exemplar by the clerks and schoolmasters of the Gaelic League, some of whom followed Patrick Pearse in ritual re-enactment of his sacrifice, in the nineteen sixteen Rising Cu/ Chulainn died strapped to a rock, like Jesus Christ on the Cross, but not before he had beheaded many enemies in classic saga fashion So, his combination of pagan aggression and Christ-like passivity, made him a version of the muscular Christians favoured by British public schools in the nineteenth century The glorious Celtic past allowed to the natives, turned out to be on inspection, a disguised version of the British imperial present", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "d9148d4e-8ada-47c9-b4a4-ece825064dbe", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.417398+00:00"}

{"text": "<Dewey Education>\n\n\n<$A> That was linguist and philosopher, Noam Chomsky, recalling his memory of attending a Dewey progressive school in the nineteen thirties John Dewey, who was to become one of the most powerful influences on educational thought in the twentieth century, was born in the town of Burlington Vermont in eighteen fifty-nine His father was proprietor of the local general store, where apparently, locals would foregather from time to time to discuss with equal interest, affairs of both state and locality According to one apocryphal story, the store window carried the legend, hams and cigars smoked and unsmoked, The intimate small-town ethos of nineteenth-century Burlington played a large part in forming Dewey 's educational outlook in two ways, one negative, one positive On the negative side he was convinced at a very early stage that the traditional, formal, deskbound approach to schooling, which was typified by the small town and rural schools of his childhood, was futile This kind of schooling was inadequate for the growing USA, a new society being born out of a simple agricultural economy, which was being transformed by unprecedented industrialisation, immigration, rapid population growth and drastic social change\n<$X> \n<$A> On the positive side, Dewey was convinced that the ordinary contacts of day-to-day community life, be they social, economic, cultural or political, provided real and significant learning situations For Dewey, politics was not just a matter of national importance removed from the concern of the ordinary citizen, but a matter of vital and immediate interest to the community He believed that the school should prepare the child for active participation in the life of the community He believed that education must break down, rather than reinforce, the gap between the experience of schooling and to the needs of a truly participatory democracy\n<$X> \n\n<$A> Dewey graduated from the University of Vermont in eighteen seventy-nine After a period spent teaching high school he went to Johns Hopkins University where he gained his PhD degree in eighteen eighty-four By his middle thirties he was head of the Department of Philosophy, Psychology and Pedagogy at the University of Chicago It was here in eighteen ninety-six that Dewey established his famous Laboratory School Dewey 's Laboratory School was not intended to implement a structured pedagogical plan It was intended as a laboratory in two senses Firstly, it was intended to facilitate research and experimentation into new principles and methods And secondly, it was designed to allow the children to take an experimental approach to their own learning The Laboratory School was to be the testing ground for Dewey 's philosophical ideas and their implementation\n<$X> \n<$A> The furniture of the traditional school tells the story of traditional education It is a story of submission, immobility, passivity and dependency\n<$X> \n<$A> Dewey 's approach was not a matter of whim or of arbitrary convictions about school design, but a central feature of his philosophy He wanted the Laboratory School to provide learners with the opportunity to create their own experience, to experiment, to inquire, to create He wanted a classroom where children could move about, form groups, plan and execute activities In short, learn for themselves under the direction and guidance of the teacher\n<$X> \n<$A> In the old system, it was the function of teachers to motivate the child, against his or her immediate interests, to learn the established subjects\n<$X> \n<$A> In Dewey 's pedagogy, the teacher has two main functions The teacher must guide the young through the complexities of life, and give them opportunities to learn in the natural way, that is by solving relevant problems The teacher must also enable the young to cope adequately with contemporary conditions, and to cope with the new tasks which an unpredictable future will bring\n<$X> \n<$A> The old model of education placed a premium on assignments, on private isolated study and on recitation The mission of the Laboratory School was to find more effective ways of learning and teaching, to find ways of breaking down barriers between schools and their local communities, and to find subject-matter which would break the hold of traditional rote learning and symbol interpretation\n<$X> \n<$A> This approach to schooling sets the pupils ' experience at nought against the accumulated knowledge of the race The pupil is made into a passive receptacle whose only function is to receive the structured subject matter which scholars have codified\n<$X> \n<$A> By contrast to the traditional approach, Dewey put the pupil at the centre of education as a wilful, purposive, and active agent in the learning process\n<$X> \n\n<$A> The Laboratory School operated on three simple principles which informed Dewey 's educational philosophy The first principle was that the business of the school is to train children in co-operative and mutually helpful living, to help them to grow into community\n<$X> \n<$A> The second principle was that the foundation of all educative activity must be in the instinctive impulsive activities of the child and not in the presentation and application of structured external material\n<$X> \n<$A> This learning is rooted in the community The individual and society cannot be considered in isolation, one from the other\n<$X> \n<$A> Finally, the Laboratory School promoted the child 's individual tendencies and activities These were to be organised and directed to promote the idea of co-operative living The learning process would take advantage of the child 's individual tendencies and activities, to reproduce on the child 's plane the typical doings and occupations of the larger, maturer society, into which the child is finally to emerge\n<$X> \n\n<$A> In nineteen o-four Dewey was appointed Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, and it was from this base that he articulated and spread the educational ideas which he had developed at the Chicago Laboratory School They were to make him the most famous and influential educator of the twentieth century He wrote, lectured and travelled extensively On his retirement in nineteen thirty, he became Emeritus Professor at Columbia It is one of the difficulties that Dewey presents to anyone who would present a short pre/cis of his career, that he lived to the age of ninety-three, active to the end He married for the second time and started a second family at the age of eighty-seven Although education may be or should be practical it is not the practicality of a narrowly vocational preparation\n<$X> \n<$A> A central concept in Dewey 's philosophy of education, and to this day perhaps the most controversial, is his concept of growth Dewey does not accept what are called teleological explanations of human effort These are explanations which place the significance of human effort in the distant future They attempt to explain present events by future ones, such as, the eventual dictatorship of the proletariat, the eventual attainment of the beatific vision, or whatever In all cases they invoke some future perfection, both to explain what we are doing now, and to stipulate what we should be doing now Teleological explanations are especially favoured by educational theorists From a definition of some manner of idealised future, you can determine what we should be teaching our children in the present Dewey rejects teleological explanations He prefers an evolutionary account of human activity which freely acknowledges our ignorance of the future In Dewey 's account, education is not a preparation for some idealised future It is simply growth, the continuing reconstruction of our experience It is not determined by any outside or independent aim or end\n<$X> \n<$A> This is difficult for traditional educators to accept, because they have always looked for the purpose and significance of education outside of the educational process itself But the growth of which Dewey speaks is not growth towards some predetermined and externally-imposed ideal or end\n<$X> \n<$A> For Dewey, there is no limit in principle to the possibilities of change, development, and evolution We simply do not know what the future holds\n\n<$A> The child 's relation to the curriculum is not the subordination of the child to the existing established knowledge Nor is it the abandonment of established existing knowledge for an anarchic child-centred approach\n<$X> \n<$A> But later the child must come to learn the ways in which human knowledge has been structured into subjects or disciplines But this is not the starting point It is a development on the journey There must first be something in the child 's experience which requires or demands this or that symbol, this or that discipline, this or that subject, before these mean anything to the child The child 's use of language for instance, must spring from the child 's own experience whether this be actual or imaginative\n<$X> \n<$A> The child 's education, the child 's growth, is a gradual differentiation of this organic experience into what is represented by the traditional categories of knowledge, such as geography, history, mathematics, literature, et-cetera\n<$X> \n<$A> As well as growing up, the child grows out into the world mediated by structured human knowledge, Dewey 's pragmatist philosophy stresses the priority of experience over theory We learn to think and reason by thinking and reasoning, by tackling real problems which arise in our experience When we think, we become conscious of a problem or obstacle to our development We analyse the situation, we identify possible solutions, we compare the implications of the different solutions and we select the best course of action We implement this in practice  Dewey 's philosophy is about dealing with problems which arise out of real situations It aims at control It stresses that solutions to problems are tentative, and are to be judged by their usefulness Its method is the method of science It aims at the control of the environment and improvement of the environment by creative and reflective thought The educational manifestation of scientific method is the project method associated with Dewey and his close follower William H Kilpatrick The project method certainly does not mean the transcription of so-called information from encyclopaedias and other sources of second-hand information, accompanied by illustrations to be hung on the classroom wall to impress important visitors The principle value of a project is the experience of doing it, not the end result In more general terms the practical importance of the result of thinking is subsidiary to the process of thinking The control and direction of inquiry is central in Dewey 's theory of education Knowledge begins in doing It is active It is in the course of putting ideas to the test of experience that growth occurs Dewey requires that pupils be given wide opportunities for purposive inquiry This is as seen in the project method The pupil learns only by thinking about problems and trying to solve them for himself\n<$X> \n<$A> It is like the difference between studying a map and making a journey While the map is a useful guide for the traveller, it is not a substitute for the experience of travelling\n<$X> \n<$A> That is to say that solving a problem is making an incoherent situation coherent and integrated When we solve a problem, we take a selection of apparently incompatible experiences, and transform them into a unified whole This unified whole is the solution to the problem\n<$X> \n<&> musical interlude /&>\n<$A> Dewey is sometimes associated with the worst excesses of so-called progressive education, a do-as-you-please approach, which it must be said exists more often in people 's imagination than in actual classrooms He was however forced to distance himself on a number of occasions from those who claimed to be his disciples Referring to the misapplication of the project method he wrote\n<$X> \n<$A> Dewey 's contribution to the development of education in the twentieth century has been incalculable, if not without its controversies His greatest contribution has been to liberate the education of children from the dead hand of tradition, and from what he himself has called the static cold storage ideal of knowledge He forged a theory and practice of education which can be relevant to contemporary industrial and social progress, without becoming the slave of either", "subdomain":

{"text": "<Columbus>\n\n\n<$A> So much has been written on Christopher Columbus, that the real problem for the historian is to distinguish those few publications that tell us something new about the navigator and his exploits, from the myriad of pieces devoted to such futile exercises as claiming a Greek, Portuguese or Spanish nativity, for a man who was unquestionably Genoese by birth Perhaps the most pointless exercise of all, because the most expensive, has been the effort sponsored by the National Geographic, to track the first Columbus trans-Atlantic voyage, to a landfall in the Bahamas, other than that suggested by Samuel  Elliot Morison in his Columbus biography of nineteen forty-two However, in the midst of the plethora of writing which extends to at least one thousand publications over the last twenty-five years, it is possible to discern some scholarly progress, and that principally derives from the critical editing of the surviving sources that shed light on the career of Columbus The more important sources are those letters, about one hundred in number by Columbus himself which have been authenticated, as well as miscellaneous notes and organisational material relating to his various voyages Then, the copy made by Fra Bartolome/ de Las Casas, of the diary kept by Columbus of his first great voyage And then the marginal notes, about three thousand in number, entered by Columbus on those of his books and maps which have survived to the present day Besides these personal survivals, historians have also been able to piece together, some details of his activities in the official archives in Genoa, Portugal and Spain On the basis of this material, historians have been able to establish some unassailable facts, although they are not agreed on how this evidence should be interpreted It seems clear that Christopher Columbus was born in the Republic of Genoa in fourteen fifty-one, into a family of modest circumstances that was associated with the wool trade The young Columbus seems to have been an accomplished sailor in Mediterranean waters, and he had become a factor in the Genoese commercial house of Centurione by fourteen seventy-six In that year he appears to been sent by his employers on a commercial voyage, bound for Flanders and England The fleet in which he was engaged was attacked by marauders off the coast of Portugal, and Columbus was cast ashore, and eventually made his way to Lisbon There, he together with his brother Bartholomew, established a map-selling business, and they may also have traded in books relating to navigation Whatever income Columbus derived from this was supplemented by voyaging in Italian and Portuguese employment And in the course of these expeditions Columbus became acquainted with the most remote areas of the Atlantic Ocean then known to Europeans, stretching from sub-Saharan Africa to Madeira, to the west coasts of England and Ireland and to Iceland In Lisbon also in fourteen seventy-nine, he married Dona Felipa Perestrello, a member of an old Madeiran family And with her he set up home in Madeira as agent of an Italian company, Dona Felipa died in fourteen eighty-five, and Columbus returned to Lisbon with his infant son Diego in that year Historians are satisfied that this interlude in Portugal and Madeira, fourteen seventy-six to fourteen eighty-five, was essential to the development both of Columbus ' expertise as a sailor, and his interests as a navigator By that point in his career he was convinced, that it was possible to gain access to the coast of Japan, by sailing westwards into the Atlantic, and he had identified this objective as his life 's ambition Thereafter, Columbus set about finding sponsorship for the voyage that he wished to undertake And when he failed to procure this sponsorship in Portugal, he went to Spain where he spent six years in penurious pursuit of the Spanish Court Eventually in fourteen ninety-one he had persuaded a group of Spanish noblemen and Italian merchants based in Spain, of the viability of his project And so he was able to get together a small exploratory fleet of three ships, that made its historic crossing of the Atlantic in fourteen ninety-two The outcome as we all know was to prove a bitter disappointment to Columbus himself,  cause he had discovered not a direct route to the fabled riches of the Orient but rather a series of  of islands previously unknown to Europeans, and inhabited by a people who were as alien to Europeans as Europeans were alien to them Although a disappointment to Columbus himself, the discovery aroused interest in a previously sceptical Europe, and he encountered little difficulty in raising support for the much more elaborate expedition of fourteen ninety-three, that is seventeen ships with about one thousand five hundred men This second expedition succeeded in establishing Spanish domination over the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola, that 's present day Haiti, and in discovering new islands in the Caribbean The desired route to Asia had however still evaded Columbus And his disappointment turned to frustration in fourteen ninety-seven, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama, had succeeded in rounding the Cape of Good Hope and crossing from the eastern coast of Africa to India This achievement of da Gama, spurred the Spanish authorities to fund yet a third expedition under the command of Columbus who had been idle in Spain since fourteen ninety-six On this third expedition of fourteen ninety-eight the fleet divided, with one section sailing due west from the Canaries to Hispaniola, while the other section directed by Columbus himself, sailed southwards beyond the Cape Verde islands, and only then sailed westwards expecting to find a land mass corresponding in size to that of Africa somewhere in mid Atlantic This expedition was fed by the belief that the vast majority of the earth 's surface is covered by land, and the discovery of the true extent of the African continent by the Portuguese, fostered the notion that a correspondingly large continent existed somewhere in the Atlantic In practice however this last voyage revealed only the island which Columbus called Trinidad, off the coast of South America And as he sailed between this island and the continental mainland he recognised, from the freshness of the water flowing outwards from the Orinoco river, that he was close to a large block of land which he thought might be where the Garden of Eden had been located Columbus did not take time however to put his theory to the test, but hastened instead to Hispaniola, where he attempted to reassert his authority over the Spaniards he had left in command there This intervention heightened tension in an already unruly situation, and provoked a royal inquiry, which resulted in Columbus and his brothers being brought back as prisoners to Spain Royal favour ensured that Columbus was quickly released and restored to all his honours and titles, except that of Governor of Hispaniola And his fourth and  final attempt to discover a direct route to Asia, was got underway in fifteen hundred and two On this occasion he came within reach of the coastline of Central America, and established himself briefly in Jamaica, before returning to Spain There in fifteen o-six he died a disillusioned man, despite having attained wealth and status for himself and his descendants, such as he could not have imagined in fourteen seventy-six Much has been made in popular literature of the Columbus voyages as the culmination of a frenetic period of scientific and technical advances, associated with the Renaissance It is true that advances had recently been made in map-making and cartography, and we know that Columbus was acquainted with these achievements, and that he corresponded with such scholars as the Florentine cosmographer Toscanelli However it was the error of such scholars in grossly underestimating the size of the world, rather than  their scientific achievements, which convinced Columbus that his objective of reaching Asia by sailing west was a realistic one Of equal importance in fixing his mind the mind of Columbus on his objective of finding a direct route to Asia, were the myths, fantasies and rumours that circulated freely among the seafaring communities of the Atlantic seaboard Stories of earlier voyages to the west beyond Iceland and Greenland, were widespread among the sea-going peoples of Northern Europe, and legends of lost islands and even a lost continent in the Atlantic were also widespread These stories would have given confidence to Columbus that his opinions were correct Further proof of a more practical nature would have come from his own witness of flotsam from the western Atlantic, thrown up on the shores of the Canary Islands and  Madeira Closely related to such proof and certainly of greater significance to Columbus was the evidence that occasioned him to make mention of his visit to Galway, which probably took place in fourteen seventy-seven This reference took the form of a marginal note in Latin on Columbus ' copy of Pierre d'Ailly 's Imago Mundi, and has been translated into English as follows,  Men of Cathay  that is China  have come towards the west Of this we have seen many signs And especially in Galway in Ireland, a man and a woman of extraordinary appearance, have come to land on two tree trunks  This episode, it has been suggested, possibly refers to the bodies of two Eskimos in a kayak, being carried southward from the coast of Canada in the great outflow from the Davis Strait, and then eastwards towards the west coast of Ireland in the Gulf Stream The oriental features of the two Eskimos would 've been proof for Columbus, that they were indeed from China, which he would 've thought to be in the same latitude as Ireland And this would have been the most potent support for his theory, that the distance to Asia was not very great, and that it was Asia which  lay westwards from Europe in the Atlantic The way in which Columbus seized upon such chance happenings as evidence to sustain his theory, shows again that it was the error of the scientists in grossly underestimating the size of the world, which convinced him that his objective was attainable And we can be certain that Columbus was fully informed of the most recent scientific information, because this was  would have been represented on the maps and globes, which he and his brother were retailing Columbus would also have been acquainted with the ongoing Portuguese investigation of the west coast of Africa And it may have been the growing evidence, in the decades before fourteen ninety-seven, that the continent was far larger than the geographers had presumed, which convinced him that the shortest route to Asia may lie westwards across the Atlantic rather than around the coast of Africa The desire to reach Asia which motivated Columbus, as it did the other explorers of his time, was also fed as much by legend and hearsay as it was by scientific evidence Existing European trade with Asia through the Mediterranean, made it clear that luxury commodities, silks and finely-wrought carpets as well as spices, were altogether more plentiful there than in Europe Growing contact with the Muslim populations who had come to dominate the eastern Mediterranean  as well as the north African coast, also demonstrated that these peoples of Asiatic origin had mastered a technology which was with many respects ahead of that prevalent in Europe And what was known from direct contacts was sustained by the information conveyed by such overland explorers of Asia, as Marco Polo in the thirteenth century and the Venetian Nicolo\\ Conti in the early fifteenth century The reasonably reliable information that could be gleaned from such explorers, was supplemented by medieval lore, which spoke of a lost Christian people in Asia or eastern Africa And most explorers including Columbus, were all too ready to mingle fact with fiction In this way the mercenary motive to reach Asia, was supplemented by the strategic one, which visualised the Muslim assailants of Christian Europe being encircled by the alliance which European powers would establish with the lost Christians of the East", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "9c849de9-3fba-4de6-8364-aa8ae5a5e795", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.421041+00:00"}
{"text": "<Clare elections>\n\n\n<$A> When the last Irish Elizabethan parliament was convened in fifteen eighty-five writs were issued for the election of two members to the lower House of Commons for Clare, which had been established as a county by Sir Henry Sidney in fifteen seventy This was a process of colonisation, which had begun with the surrender of the Thomond chieftains to Henry the Eighth in fifteen forty-three The electorate consisted of the forty-shilling freeholders namely, those who had free tenements to the minimum value of forty shillings above all charges And the successful candidates were, Sir Turlough O'Brien, Ennistymon and Boetius Clancy, Knockfin, who would gain notoriety a few years later when, in his capacity as County Sheriff he dealt harshly with survivors of the Spanish Armada No record of the fifteen eighty-five election has survived, but the fact that John McNamara chief of West Clancullen in addition to Rossa O'Loughlin, Burren, and Turlough O'Brien, Ballycrid felt it necessary to attend the parliament in Dublin as observers, indicated that they may have been unsuccessful candidates and that they believed their presence was necessary to protect their interests against the expansionist land ambitions of the Fourth Earl of Thomond who, in company with the Baron of Inchiquin and the Protestant Bishop of Killaloe were entitled to sit in the more influential upper House The previous session of parliament in fifteen sixty had been described as, more like a bear-baiting of disordered persons than a parliament of wise men And, in fifteen eighty-five the opposition was equally vociferous, as the struggle for land titles, and the carve-up of confiscated Church lands continued The session of Parliament was followed in Clare by the establishment of a government-appointed commission to continue these deliberations It resulted in the county being divided into nine baronies, the main beneficiaries being the Earl of Thomond and the Baron of Inchiquin who both received extensive land grants, a development which angered John McNamara so much that he refused to sign the agreement No further parliaments were held in Ireland until the reign of James the First when, following the Plantation of Ulster writs for the convening of a parliament were issued in sixteen hundred and ten, whose main purpose would be to give recognition to the king 's title of the confiscated lands The responsibility for convening the parliament was given to Sir Arthur Chichester and, in conjunction with the government 's determination to return a Protestant majority in the fractious Commons, a total of forty new boroughs were created, in which the power to elect members would be restricted to a small number of exclusively Protestant corporation members The Letters Patent for the new borough of Ennis, which would be composed of a provost and just twelve burgesses, was signed by King James in sixteen hundred and twelve And the Earl of Thomond duly arranged for the appointment of two English settlers, John Thornton, Doonass and Edmund Blood, Bohersallagh as the borough 's first representatives The government however had less control over the election of county members And in Clare, two recusants, Catholics who professed an often strident loyalty to the King were elected, namely Sir Daniel O'Brien who was reported as having become a fervent Catholic in sixteen hundred and two, and Boetius Clancy whose father had been a member of the fifteen eighty-five parliament, both of whom became active members of the opposition But the proceedings opened chaotically with the recusants opposing the nomination of Sir John Davies the government appointee as speaker And Sir Daniel O'Brien was one of the recusant members who attempted to physically install their own candidate, Sir John Everett in the Speaker 's chair Following the subsequent withdrawal of the opposition members, Parliament was paroled for a year, with both sides petitioning the King, before it was finally dissolved in sixteen fifteen It was the only parliament to be summoned during the reign of James the First, and a period of almost twenty years elapsed before the Lord Deputy Thomas Wentworth convened the parliament in sixteen thirty-four, to ensure the voting of badly-needed money supplies to King Charles the First, while at the same time managing to backpedal on the promised enactment of the Grace legislation The same county members were again elected to represent Clare but, by now a Protestant majority was assured in the Commons and Wentworth had little difficulty in carrying through his own programme When the second parliament of Charles the First met five years later, Clare was represented by four new members, the most prominent of whom was Captain Dermot O'Brien, Dromore Ruan, a first cousin of Sir Barnaby O'Brien the sixth Earl of Thomond Mutual enmity towards Thomas Entworth now the Earl of Stafford initially united all factions when the parliament met, and Captain Dermot O'Brien was an important member of various committees, as a final attempt was made to have the principal Statutes of the Graces enacted The outbreak of the sixteen forty-one rebellion effectively put an end to the influence of the parliament And Captain Dermot O'Brien who, with former member Sir Daniel O'Brien joined the rebels, became a leading member of the Supreme Council of the Confederation of Kilkenny, and later supported Papal Nuncio Rinuccini when he broke with the Confederation Social upheaval in Clare was accentuated when the county was included in the transplantation of Connacht And when an election took place for Irish members to attend the Cromwellian parliament in London, Clare, along with Kerry and Limerick represented by Sir Henry Ingoldsby, a Cromwellian soldier who was governor of Clare and also held land along the Shannon estuary The continuing weakness of the native chieftains of the county became evident when the restoration parliament of Charles the Second met in sixteen sixty-one Ingoldsby managed to retain one of the county seats, while another Cromwellian officer, William Purefoy was elected as a member for Ennis borough Once again, the vexed question of land resettlement dominated the proceedings, but apart from John McNamara, Knappogue, who retrieved part of his estates, and the octogenarian Sir Daniel O'Brien who, with his sons had served with Charles the Second in exile, the vast majority of the new settlers managed to retain possession of their lands The only Irish parliament to be held in the reign of Charles the Second was dissolved in sixteen sixty-six He was succeeded by his Catholic brother James the Second in sixteen eighty-five but, following the invasion of England by William of Orange, James initially fled to France before arriving in Ireland to attempt to win back his crown He immediately summoned a parliament and, the response from Clare where regiments of infantry and dragoons in support of James had been formed was enthusiastic And John McNamara and Denis O'Brien, a son of Viscount Clare, were elected as the county members The charters of town boroughs had already been revoked, and replaced by Catholic burgesses The two members chosen to represent Ennis were Florence McNamara and Theobald Butler But, the enactments of what was termed the patriot or the Jacobite parliament, and which included the attainment of leading Protestant settlers in the county who had supported William of Orange were always going to be contested on the field of battle And, following the defeat of James at the Battle of the Boyne, and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Limerick the original charter of the borough of Ennis was restored, while the county seats reverted to adherents of the Protestant Ascendancy, to members of the Burton and Gore families, and to Sir Donough O'Brien, who had been appointed as a reluctant sheriff in sixteen eighty-nine and who needed the assistance of a petition from the Protestant inhabitants of the county before his bona fides were accepted in England at the conclusion of the war As the eighteenth century progressed parliaments were held on a more regular basis and, as the balance of power shifted away from the Upper House, membership of the Commons became more prestigious Boroughs also became increasingly under the personal ownership of individual proprietors And the borough of Ennis was initially controlled by members of the Bindon family, with David Bindon and his sons Samuel and David acting as its representatives until seventeen sixty-one David Bindon Junior, a former Limerick city-based merchant, who possessed a strong entrepreneurial or maverick streak, was a prominent member of the Commons in the seventeen thirties He wrote a number of pamphlets about the state of the country 's finances, and unsuccessfully propositioned the commissioners of revenue to adopt his scheme to improve the collection of the inland excise But the most important of the members from Clare in the eighteenth century was Sir Lucius O'Brien, a disciple of the radical Clare-born Dr Charles Lucas He entered Parliament as a member for Ennis in seventeen sixty-six, when the O'Brien family of Dromoland in conjunction with the Burton family took control of the borough, and he was elected as a county member in the general election of seventeen sixty-eight A solicitor by profession, who had a practice in Dublin, in addition to his estates in Clare, Lucius O'Brien acted as the Commons workhorse in bringing in heads of countless bills for a period of over quarter of a century He possessed an unrivalled knowledge of national and international trade matters, and was one of the main protagonists responsible for the development of free trade for Ireland in what became known as Grattan 's Parliament But the unwillingness of the Irish Parliament to reform itself led indirectly to its own downfall And following the rebellion of seventeen ninety-eight, Pitt brought forward an Act of Union which passed despite the opposition of Sir Edward O'Brien, the son of Sir Lucius and, of prime serjeant James Fitzgerald who had close connections with the county But county member Hugh Dillon Massey, Doonass supported the measure, with the tacit backing of the newly-enfranchised Catholic voters, and fortified by a bribe of five thousand pounds, while borough Member John Ormsby Vandeleur, Kilrush, who had formerly been a stern critic of government trade policy also supported the Union legislation, having accepted the post of a Commissioner of Revenue According to the terms of the Union Bill between Ireland and Great Britain, the county of Clare retained its two seats in the House of Commons in London, while representation in the borough of Ennis was reduced to one member As the importance of the Catholic vote increased, even though the forty-shilling freeholders were largely manipulated by the principal land owners, the long-delayed Catholic Emancipation legislation became an issue at each election, and was supported by all of the county 's members James Fitzgerald had succeeded in gaining part control of Ennis borough in eighteen hundred and three, but it was his son William, better known as Vesey Fitzgerald who made the greater impact following his election to the borough in eighteen hundred and seven and subsequently as a county Member in eighteen eighteen Vesey Fitzgerald owed his political advancement as Chancellor of the Irish Treasury to his father 's influence with the government, following his surrender of incriminating letters entrusted to him by Mrs Mary Anne Clarke a former mistress of the Duke of York But Vesey Fitzgerald although not an instinctive politician was an excellent speaker and an able administrator and he quickly secured a solid power base in Clare, with a judicious sprinkling of sinecures, public, offices and army promotions to the friends and relatives of prominent vote-getters in the county He was a supporter of Catholic Emancipation and, in spite of stiff opposition from the landed lobby, brought in an enlightened grand jury bill which attempted to curb the excesses and corruption associated with the building and repair of roads In January eighteen twenty-four the moribund Catholic Association received fresh impetus when Councillor Daniel O'Connell proposed that every Catholic should contribute a monthly sum of between a penny and two shillings according to their circumstances",

{"text": "<Edmund Rice>\n\n\n<$A> Edmund Rice 's life spanned a crucial era, from the dawn of Catholic Emancipation to the eve of the Great Famine These were critical years in the formation of Irish Catholic consciousness, marking the emergence from the Penal era and the establishment of the modern Church In all of this, Rice made a significant contribution, fostering confidence, and creating the literate class which gave modern Ireland its Catholic Nationalist character The beatification of Edmund Rice will inevitably focus attention on his life and deeds He 's perhaps one of the most famous men of his generation, yet ironically, surprisingly little is known about him The absence of a diary, memoirs, or a contemporary biographer restrict our images of the man 's personality, to mere glimpses Above all his modesty and reticence, make him an elusive subject, His contemporaries for instance, appear to have been unaware of the most basic details about his short marriage and his handicapped daughter Edmund 's modesty was extreme On one occasion the brothers requested him to sit for a portrait,  For what , he snapped,  So that you can look at it while I 'm in purgatory  As a result subsequent artistic representations, do little to reveal his character And gradually the ruggedness of his earliest portrait gave way to the stylised, airbrushed prints so familiar to any pupil of the Brothers ' schools In a similar way, the removal of the farm buildings around the Rice home at Callan County Kilkenny, has given the cottage an unnatural appearance And from this it is difficult to imagine the life lived by the family at Westcourt Yet in a sense, the memory of Edmund Rice has become a victim of the same treatment Successive biographers have isolated Rice from his historical context,  and this exercise has created a bland image, of a pious benefactor, devoting his considerable wealth to the education of a grateful poor Such an interpretation, uh offers an image of Rice and his time which is without nuance, Uhm the Penal era is presented in absolute terms, uh where Catholics are reduced to slavery and subjection, and to unrelenting persecution, ignorance and misery Yet in stark contrast, the Rice household is portrayed as a warm comfortable environment, in which the young Edmund gained a love of God and practical lessons in charity Uhm so little explanation is offered for this apparent contradiction, nor of Edmund 's ability to amass a considerable fortune So the challenge then, is to separate Edmund Rice from these hagiographical representations, so that by re-creating his historical context, we may arrive at a more accurate appreciation of his character, and the significance of his achievement Recent historical writing has challenged the traditionally-accepted image of the Penal era as a period of unrelenting persecution Instead, the story of the Church which emerges, is one of endurance, and emergence And this was a period of gradual revival, a period where Catholics creatively exploited loopholes in the Penal code, Uh in many respects however, uhm the Catholic revival was uneven, Uhm the obvious differences were geographic, and the recovery was most pronounced in mid-Munster and south Leinster And this renewal percolated only slowly into Ulster and north Connacht In social terms too, uh contrary to the received image, Catholicism as an institutional force, was more firmly entrenched in the richer areas, amongst the upper social classes, uh and in the towns The complexity of this Penal era, is reflected in the case of the Rice family of Callan Edmund 's father farmed one hundred and eighty-two acres, and their home was similar to many owned by strong farmers It was a long thatched cottage, with four bedrooms, a kitchen, a parlour and a small hall The Rice family lived a frugal lifestyle, and this was in part, the key to the strength of these rising families They had small outgoings Uhm they were able to endure hard times But during the  agricultural boom in the last quarter of the eighteenth century, they were in a position to accumulate capital Now this prosperity coincided with the first steps towards the dismantling of the Penal Laws From seventeen seventy-eight onwards, Catholics were in a position to avail of leases, and they could often outbid their more ostentatious Protestant neighbours The Rices of Westcourt were notoriously ambitious, and evidence suggests that they were regarded as land-grabbers By all accounts they were anxious to become rich quick, and they were fond of land, and always eager to secure a good place But these ambitions could not be satisfied without serious social consequences And the advance of the large tenant farmers, increased land hunger, unemployment, and this led to rural unrest amongst the Catholic community But like many of their class, the Rices had a second string to their bow, and the Waterford branch of the family maintained a thriving provisioning business Edmund 's uncle specialised in livestock, the slaughtering and the packing and exporting of meat to Bristol and Newfoundland Uh in addition, he  very lucrative contracts with the admiralty, and with shipping companies Uh in seventeen seventy-nine, uh the young Edmund joined his uncle at Waterford, and within twenty years, through trade and shrewd investments, he  amassed a fortune and land-holdings in excess of two thousand acres Yet in this too, there is suggestion that Edmund, like his family in Callan may have been anxious to get rich quick Perhaps his subsequent condemnation of money lending, suggests that he was engaged in that practice Yet it was from this class of Catholics, the strong farmers and the merchant ranks, that the great impetus for the Catholic revival came These were the driving force behind the spate of chapel building which characterised the period, and it was they who tackled the problems of Catholic education This was a closely-knit group, and they shared many common connections The Jesuit provincial Peter Kenny for instance, was the spiritual director to both Edmund Rice and Teresa Ball, the founder of the Irish Loreto Sisters Uh Edmund was inspired by the work of Nano Nagle, and she in return was related to Edmund Burke the great champion of Catholic Emancipation Uhm she was also related to Father Theobald Matthew, the Apostle of Temperance, Uh so in Waterford, uh Edmund, the successful businessman and merchant, was at the centre of a bustling social scene, and this included the prosperous Aylwards, the Shields and the St Leger families Uhm Edmund shared their concerns and ambitions Uh he played an active role in Catholic politics of the time He was a member of the Catholic Committee, which campaigned for Emancipation, and his name appeared in the Waterford address, in support of the Catholic Declaration of seventeen ninety-two It was at this time too, that Edmund met Mary Elliot, uh the daughter of a Waterford tanner, and whom he married in seventeen eighty-five Uhm yet surprisingly little is known of this crucial period in Edmund 's life Uh in one biography of over five hundred pages, the episode is dealt with in just a few paragraphs Tragically, this marriage ended abruptly, with Mrs Rice 's sudden death in seventeen eighty-nine But this crisis was compounded, by the fact that Edmund was left to care for the couple 's handicapped daughter Again little is known of the extent or the nature, of Mary Rice 's handicap Perhaps this is due in part to his own reserve, but it may also reflect an attempt by Rice 's earlier followers, to preserve their founder from any suggestion of genetic weakness Accordingly, Mrs Rice 's death was attributed to a fall from a horse, an accident which conveniently accounted for the handicapped, premature daughter uh Clearly Edmund was desolated, and while no record of his grief survives, a letter written to a friend in similar circumstances, reflects an empathy with their misery and misfortune It is clear too, that this tragedy, marked a very perceptible change in his life and priorities This was the moment of his conversion, the point where he abandoned the ambitions of his class, and where his religious faith and the practical expression of it became the dominant feature of his life In seventeen ninety, he joined a religious confraternity, a confraternity dedicated to charity and the frequent reception of the sacraments Uhm his name appears on the subscription lists, for several religious publications, including the Dublin edition of a Bible which he annotated influential texts At this time too, he was among the founders of The Trinitarian Orphan Society, and in seventeen four ninety-four, he assisted in the establishment of the Waterford Society, for the Relief of Distressed Room Keepers His principle concern however, was the plight of prisoners, and this remained a priority throughout his life There are two fascinating accounts from this time, of individual beneficiaries of Rice 's charity Uh one was a black slave boy, who Edmund saw on the deck of a vessel at the quay in Waterford Reflecting sentiments of his contemporary Wilberforce, Rice bought the boy from the ship 's master, and entrusted him to the care of the Presentation Sisters on Hennessy 's Road When the boy grew, he worked as a messenger for the Sisters, and later Edmund helped him to purchase a premises In time Black Johnny succeeded in business, and on his death his property, consisting of two houses, was left between the Christian Brothers, and the Presentation Sisters A second beneficiary was the young Italian immigrant Charles Bianconi, whom Rice advised and helped to secure a premises in Clonmel In time Bianconi established a thriving transport system and was elected Mayor of the town But he never forgot his early benefactor, and each year he sent fifty pounds, and twenty suits of clothes for the poor boys His appreciation for the good friend who took a kindly interest in him, was reflected in a clause of his will which, in the absence of an heir, would have bequeathed his fortune to the Christian Brothers Unfortunately, Bianconi was survived by a daughter Uh in time then, Edmund considered a vocation to the priesthood, and the Augustinian Order, of which his brother John became Assistant General seemed an obvious choice Yet his brother and friends in Waterford, convinced him otherwise, arguing that his calling was to the poor of the city, rather than the seclusion of the monastic cloister Edmund 's religious conversion, coincided with a heated educational debate in Waterford, a debate which had begun with Bishop Hussy 's forthright condemnation, of the proselytising schools Edmund was inspired by this argument, and in eighteen hundred, he set out to do for the poor boys of Waterford, what Nano Nagle had done for the Catholic girls of Cork His first school began in an old stable in New Street Conditions there were primitive Furniture was sparse, and benches were borrowed each day from a nearby pub Uh Rice lived above the school, and within months he was joined by two Callan men, and together they formed a religious community This trio, was the genesis of what would become two great religious congregations, The Presentation and the Christian Brothers Uhm the hedge schools of the Penal era were not as we once believed Uh in reality, they were private fee-paying schools, which operated on a commercial basis, uh and this made them inaccessible to the vast majority of the population Uh in general the only alternative, uhm was the free education offered by the endowed schools, but the Catholic community was suspicious of their alleged proselytising activities So it was for this reason, that Edmund and his confreres set about offering a Catholic education to the poor, uh the poor about whom nobody cared Uhm but the Brothers ' charity extended beyond the provision of educating uh education The Brothers ' pupils received a daily meal of bread and milk, and a tailor was employed at Mount Zion to repair the boys ' tattered clothes Uh it was understandable, that Rice received invitations from bishops throughout Ireland, to establish schools in their diocese, and whenever possible, he responded favourably Uhm but there were limitations on his freedom of response The shortage of manpower remained a problem, uhm and it was not long before his  fortune was exhausted", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Frank O'Connor>\n\n\n<$A> When talking about Frank O'Connor 's achievement, we must begin and end with his favourite art form, the short story In between it 's important to salute the great range of his accomplishment, in the novel, in drama, autobiography and biography, in translation and criticism to say nothing of his amazing skills as a lecturer and broadcaster But even in these various forms his overriding mode was the narrative, the challenge of telling a story with maximum economy and impact One of my own absolutely favourite poems, is his eight-line translation of an eighth century Irish lyric, The Drowning of Conang In the death of the young prince within sight of shore, O'Connor combines tragedy, ethic and lyric, within the same narrative phrase  The shining waters rise and swell, and break across the shining strand And Conang, gazes at the land swung high in his frail coracle Then she with the bright hair of foam, the blinding hair that Conang grips, rises, to turn triumphant lips, on all the gods that guard us home  The placing of that word \" rises \" at the beginning of the second last line, is the touch of a master rhetorician The shining waters of the first line become the implacable goddess of the waves, who rises to prove the frailty of all human pride and aspiration In the great O'Connor stories there 's always a moment like that, where the narrative rises quietly or fiercely, to reveal its inner meaning Readers will differ in detail as to what O'Connor 's greatest stories are but few would dispute that the following list contains some of them, In the Train, The Majesty of the Law, The Bridal Night, Peasants, Uprooted, The Luceys, and the title story of his posthumous collection, The Cornet Player Who Betrayed Ireland Now it may be noted with dismay or rage that this list does not include some of his most popular stories, especially those masterpieces of early childhood experience, like The Study of History, My Oedipus Complex, The Drunkard, First Confession and so on I 'll return to these celebrated tales in a moment What I want to focus on for the present however is the idea, of the perfectly-timed moments of revelation, upon which these other and to my mind greater O'Connor stories depend In The Train a story adapted in nineteen thirty-seven for the Abbey stage in collaboration with Hugh Hunt, unfolds its pattern in the course of a train journey from Dublin to a village called Farranchreesht, in the West, Cork seaboard The story begins with a gardai/ sergeant 's bored and snobbish wife, looking out the window of a railway carriage at Kingsbridge, dreading her return to that despised outpost to which her husband 's profession has doomed them Then, in a passage of startling vividness, we see through her eyes what she calls their charming neighbours arrive on the platform Into the pale lamplight stepped a group of peasants Not such as one sees near a capital, but in the mountains and along the coasts, gnarled, wild, with turbulent faces, their ill-cut clothes full of character The women in pale brown shawls, the men wearing black sombreros and carrying big sticks, they swept in ill-at-ease laughing and shouting defiantly And so much part of their natural environment were they, that for a moment they seemed to create about themselves rocks and bushes, tarns, turf ricks and the sea The collision of two worlds one modern bourgeois Anglo-Saxon, the other spontaneous traditional Gaelic is immediately established And as the train rolls south, that contrast is revealed as being at the heart of the unfolding drama, Because these country people have come to Dublin to give evidence in a murder case, a crime of passion, in which one of their community Helena Maguire, has been accused of poisoning her husband It becomes clear, that they have shamelessly perjured themselves to clear her name It becomes equally clear, that they intend to punish her in their own way when they get her home Indeed they 're outraged that she dares to return at all The revelation I 've been talking about, comes in the third movement, in the exclamation of a woman who has otherwise stayed silent  Oh Farranchreesht Farranchreesht, cried the young woman with the haggard face, the ragged lineaments of which were suddenly transfigured, Farranchreesht and the sky above you, I wouldn't change places with the Queen of England tonight, And suddenly Farranchreesht, the bare bogland with the humpbacked mountains behind, the little white houses and the dark fortifications of turf that made it seem like the flame-blackened ruin of some mighty city, all was lit up in their minds  With the outburst of this anonymous villager, we begin to understand why these simple, subtle, religious people have so perjured themselves The good name of the little village represents a higher value, than the alien law that has dragged them to Dublin And the point is reinforced by Helena 's last word as she declares, that the man for whom she has killed is, no more to me than the salt sea We share a perception which is at once spiritual, psychological, cultural And we don't have to be Irish to experience as readers, the universality of that emotion Similar moments of insight are reached in The Majesty of the Law, when Dan Bride explains to the sergeant, why he won't pay the fine, or when the peasants in a story of that name refuse to prosecute Michael John Cronin for stealing the funds, of the local football club, or when the narrator in Guests of the Nation realises that Jeremiah Donovan has no great liking for the two English hostages, whom he is destined to execute O'Connor one of the few writers with a coherent theory of the short story form, believed passionately in the importance of these moments at which the writer finds to quote him,  a point of vantage, a glowing centre of action, from which past and future are equally visible  Unlike the novelist the short story writer is engaged in what O'Connor calls a struggle with time A refusal to allow it to establish its majestic rhythms When the writer finds that moment, we are given to understand, the shape and meaning of his fable is delivered unto him As with the drowning of Conang, the best of O'Connor 's short stories combine in this moment, the lyric and the drama in about equal proportion What is remarkable about these great stories, or so it seems to me, is that they not do not concern, those shaping autobiographical events and issues that have haunted him Frank O'Connor personally, and which have made him the sort of writer he is I mean those years of underprivileged childhood in the Cork city slums, his mother a domestic servant, reared in an orphanage, his father a violent alcoholic At arm 's length during the war years, a terrifying, presence from nineteen eighteen onwards Born in nineteen hundred and three young Michael O'Donovan, if that was his real name, was thirteen in the year of the Easter Rising and fifteen when his father was demobilised from the British Army after the Great War He suffered the daily fate of a self-confessed mother 's boy in a ragamuffin, macho world, where that role was neither popular nor profitable In Freudian terms that childhood was the family romance, rehearsed as nightmare Add to this the sense of social shame he felt as a sensitive adolescent in such an intimate, class-conscious city Yet, when he confronted this material in his chosen form, it all seemed to come out as comedy, sentiment, gentle self-mockery even whimsy I mean all those stories of his childhood which delighted the readers of the New Yorker and the Atlantic Monthly, through the forties and the fifties, First Confession, My Oedipus Complex, The Genius The Drunkard and that comi-tragic tale The Duke 's Children which he recorded so memorably for radio before he died Few readers or critics of these witty and accomplished stories have registered any sense of the agonised reality out of which they were born That reality had to wait for the first great volume of his autobiography, An Only Child But more of that in a moment, These childhood stories on the contrary, are the works that prompted Francis Stewart to declare O'Connor soft-centred, and Patrick Kavanagh to describe him as sentimental As if to excuse the tone and idiom of these tales, O'Connor shifted his ground from moments of intensity to a new concept of the narrative voice In the introduction to a nineteen fifty-six edition of his stories he complains that, generations of skilful stylists from Chekhov to Catherine Mansfield, had so fashioned the short story that it no longer rang with the tone of a man 's voice speaking He is not referring of course to the voices of dialogue, in which O'Connor, has no rival since Joyce He 's really talking about the sound of his own voice, as it performs its various role as narrator At best this aggrandisement of the speaking voice, becomes his guarantee of formal unity At worst it becomes a substitute for technique, an evasion of his struggle with time In short, when the writer adopts the role and tone of the raconteur, there is danger that the story will decline into anecdote Take the opening to The Genius Some children are sissies by nature, but I was a sissy by conviction Mother had told me about geniuses, I wanted to be one, and I could see for myself that fighting as well as being sinful was dangerous The kids round the barracks, where I lived were always fighting Mother said they were savages, that I needed proper friends,  that once I was old enough to go to school I would meet them, The story goes on to recount, the child, little Larry 's infatuation with an older girl whose little brother had been killed in a motor accident When she leaves him for an older boy his mother offers him the dubious consolation, that he had only reminded the girl, of her little brother O'Connor 's last sentence reads,  I felt it for the poor sad lonesome thing being a genius  It rounds the story off neatly But perhaps a little too comfortably The pain both of hero and heroine have been somehow, cushioned from us I 'm not saying this in order to denigrate a body of fiction, that has held its own in the marketplace among discriminating readers who without the help of criticism or academe, for half a century, and which seem secure for a century to come if not indeed the millennium I 'm just wondering aloud whether O'Connor was in fact cushioning this childhood experience from himself Without that avuncular voice mediating between us and the experience, much of this childhood fiction would be unbearable Young Larry Delaney trying to envision the alternative lifestyle he would have enjoyed if either of his parents had made better marriages, and is actually seeking out an old flame of his father, in a story coyly entitled The Study of History The painful sense of an identity mislaid in The Duke 's Children, with its world-weary dying fall, wherein he sees his younger self as, one of those outcasts of a lost fatherland who go through life living above and beyond themselves like some image of man 's original aspiration The Drunkard and My Oedipus Complex are deservedly famous, for their humour as well as for their psychological insight and shrewd social commentary But when O'Connor came to confront the same experiences in An Only Child, there are no shock absorbers in the narrative tone Here 's his father in the horrors  Jesus I 'll put an end to this, he would mutter, and take down the razor His threats were never empty, as I well knew since the night, when I was an infant, and he flung the two of us into Blarney Lane in our nightclothes And we shivered there on the roadway til some neighbours took us in, and let us lie on blankets before the fire Whenever he brandished the razor at mother I went into hysterics, and a couple of times I threw myself on him, beating him with my fists,  and so on Having kept that nightmare at bay through one hundred and fifty published stories, O'Connor confronts it in the final decade of his life, in direct factual narrative The second volume My Father 's Son has nothing of that force, because it it has none of its naked terror The spectre had been exorcised", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Creation of Dail>\n\n\n<$A> In this lecture, I will discuss aspects of civil and military relations within the independence movement in the years immediately following Da/il E/ireann 's first meeting on the twenty-first of January nineteen nineteen Coincidentally but symbolically, this was the same day that two policemen were shot dead at Soloheadbeg in the first serious act of violence in the War of Independence That day thus marked the somewhat uneasy and temporary fusion of two distinct strands in Irish nationalism, the constitutional and the revolutionary, in a unitary independence movement My aims are firstly to explore key issues surrounding the control of the army, and secondly to comment on the consequences for the military and for defence policy in independent Ireland of what happened in the first chaotic and violent years of Da/il E/ireann 's existence The defence forces have suffered ever since from the circumstances of their establishment Generations of Irish politicians have heaped praise on the army as the epitome of national discipline and the guarantor of national sovereignty Successive governments have nevertheless, failed to develop even the outlines of a credible defence policy, while the army has been hampered in discharging its incoherent mandate by a chronic lack of money, and by a Byzantine system of administration designed primarily to keep the warriors in perpetual thrall to the Department of Defence The Gleeson report of nineteen ninety on pay and conditions in the defence forces, undoubtedly the most authoritative examination of the army yet published, commented that, the defence forces have traditionally enjoyed high esteem and trust, but their  internal affairs have tended to attract, a relatively low level of public and political interest Armies and democracies tend by turn to be ignored or, at best, taken for granted, and then trustingly looked to on the occasion of a variety of military emergencies The defence forces in this country are no exception In many respects however, the experience of the Irish defence forces has been exceptional when measured against those of other newly-independent states This is demonstrated by the remarkably low level of defence spending since independence, by governments ' deeply ingrained unwillingness to comment on defence policy except in those anodyne terms, and by the absence of any informed debate on defence issues The declared primary role of the defence forces since the end of the Civil War in nineteen twenty-three, has been to defend the State from external attack In reality, however, successive governments have relied not on the army but on the defensive umbrella provided by Britain and her allies, to shield the State from external aggression In practice it has been the army 's dismal fate since the early nineteen twenties, to subsist at a size and at a level of equipment just sufficient to perpetuate the domestic illusion, that the State is capable of effective action against external aggression, and to deal with any likely internal security threat The latter function has sometimes seen the army required to act, not so much in aid of the civil power, the conventional phrase used to describe its security and other activities within the State, but in lieu of it A striking example is the use of military courts during the  Civil War, in the nineteen thirties, and again during the Emergency to administer justice for anti-state offences The army has also had a wide miscellany of non-military jobs routinely thrust upon it Some of these such as helicopter search and rescue duties, derive from its military functions Others however, such as collecting rubbish during a bin strike, or running an emergency shelter for Dublin 's homeless, are given to it simply because it is a convenient source of disciplined and obedient labour Independent Ireland 's defence policy in practice appears all the more curious, given the means by which independence was won, and the practical legitimacy of the new State established The struggle against the military and police machines of the British government in Ireland, was followed by a civil war, in which the national army, defeated armed Republican resistance to the new order In such circumstances, one might expect to find the military revered and cosseted, by deferential ministers anxious to keep them quiet This was scarcely the army 's experience Similarly, Nationalist Ireland 's enduring grievance about partition, might have been expected to influence the development and organisation of the defence forces In fact, once the border was confirmed in December nineteen twenty-five, the army was required to operate as though neither the political entity nor the territory of Northern Ireland existed This injunction left the defence forces desperately ill-informed, when the Second World War broke out It caused further difficulties when the Northern Troubles flared up again in nineteen sixty-nine, and the possibility of Irish Army intervention was canvassed by ministers unfamiliar with modern military realities Finally, from nineteen twenty-three the defence forces were required to plan for their nominal primary task of  resisting external aggression, without any consultation with or explicit reference to Britain, which was not only the implicit strategic guarantor of Irish security but also much the most plausible threat to it, The vicissitudes endured by the army since the early nineteen twenties, are explained partly by three historical factors The first is the policy of military neutrality, adopted from the outset by the Irish Free State, which over the years has acquired the status of holy writ It is outside the ambit of this lecture The second factor is the nature of the War of Independence, and the third is the ambiguous and tangled relationships between and within the military and the political wings of the independence movement after nineteen thirteen Between nineteen nineteen and nineteen twenty-one, Ireland experienced a sporadic scattered small-scale guerrilla war Its object was not to inflict direct military defeat on a vastly superior enemy, but to make the country ungovernable, and to force Britain to recognise the legitimacy of Irish demands for self-rule Ulster apart, these tactics succeeded Their very success however, seems to have left both a generation of political leaders, and the public at large, under the impression that all that would ever be needed to deter or to expel an external aggressor was a few rifles in the right hands With the exception of Richard Mulcahy and, arguably, Sean MacEntee, no senior politician, on either side of the Treaty Divide after nineteen twenty-three, wasted their energies on the serious consideration of external defence issues, until forced to do so by events And despite the chastening experience of the Emergency, the old assumptions reasserted themselves once World War Two ended What Tom Garvin has described as the extraordinary political longevity, of the revolutionary elite ensured that these views held currency at least until the early nineteen sixties Some would say that they persist today, The explanation for the political sensitivity of military issues, also lies in what happened between nineteen thirteen, and nineteen twenty-four It is generally held that the contemporary defence forces are the direct descendants of the Irish Volunteers, formed in nineteen thirteen as an open Nationalist militia, pledged to ensure that the Irish Home Rule Bill would be applied in full In June nineteen fourteen, the organisation was forced to accept the control of John Redmond, who appeared on the verge of achieving a substantial measure of independence by constitutional means, as long as the British government would keep its nerve on Home Rule, and face down the threat of violence from Unionist Ulster By imposing his control on the Irish Volunteers, he hoped to rein in the wilder separatist elements, who might otherwise seek confrontation with the British authorities After the outbreak of World War One, most volunteers took their lead from Redmond, and supported the British war effort A minority of perhaps five percent seceded, retaining the title of the Irish Volunteers This was a significant moment, because it illustrated the conditional nature of the subordination of armed to constitutional politics within the Nationalist movement Two years later came the Easter Rising, the brainchild of the Military Council of the long-established secret society the IRB It was organised behind the back of the Volunteer 's Chief of Staff Eoin MacNeill, by a group of his officers who ensured that the rebellion went ahead, despite his countermanding order This illustrated the conditional nature of subordination and allegiance even within the revolutionary movement, and it probably contributed to the mistrust of the IRB, later displayed by some key political figures, including Eamon de Valera In launching the rebellion, the IRB proclaimed an Irish Republic, declared itself the rightful government of Ireland, and created an Irish Republican Army, into which the Irish Volunteers and other combatants were automatically subsumed From this it followed that the IRA, or the Volunteers as they continued generally to be known, were the military arm of the IRB 's Irish Republic The IRB itself remained an oath-bound secret society, espousing Republican principles, but run on strictly hierarchical lines, and demanding absolute obedience from its members It stood apart from the IRA and from Sinn Fe/in, although most IRA commanders, and many  of the leading figures in Sinn Fe/in, were also IRB members Florence O'Donoghue, a senior officer in both the IRB and the IRA, was later to observe that this, interlocking of leadership personnel, while it tended to unify policy and correlate activities between the different organisations within the independence movement, had serious disadvantages which later became apparent, <&Irish> An </&Irish> Taoiseach Albert Reynolds recently observed, that amongst the first Da/il 's achievements was the establishment of the, primacy of the civil power over the military While civilian primacy is now an unremarked cornerstone of Irish constitutional politics however, the evidence suggests that the question of the ultimate loyalty of the military wing of the independence movement was a vexed one, until the collapse of the army mutiny in nineteen twenty-four Throughout the War of Independence, there were confusion of allegiance between the Da/il government and the IRB, and between the IRB and the IRA After the Treaty came civil war, won decisively by those willing to accept the qualified independence, of a twenty-six county Free State, within the British commonwealth, But a rift persisted even amongst the victors In March nineteen twenty-four a faction within the military, resentful of developments in the army since nineteen twenty-two, threatened the government with mutiny That crisis was overcome, but another group of challengers to the supremacy of elected civilian government endured, in the Republican movement Irish separatist history since nineteen thirteen is littered with such legitimist claims, abandoned oaths, and rival authorities Throughout the campaign for self-determination after nineteen thirteen, even during what de Valera termed the, four years of magnificent discipline from nineteen seventeen to nineteen twenty-one, relations between the political and military wings of the separatist movement were fraught with uncertainty That grew rather than lessened, after the establishment of Da/il E/ireann, although this did not become public knowledge until after the treaty was signed, Sinn Fe/in 's success in the nineteen eighteen election, was seen as a resounding democratic endorsement of the right to self-determination, to use <&Irish> An </&Irish> Taoiseach 's words once more However, when Da/il E/ireann was established, it did not automatically become the only focus of allegiance and font of legitimacy, for members of the independence movement The IRA had its own executive, dominated by but distinct from the IRB The IRB regarded itself as the legal embodiment of the Republic proclaimed in nineteen sixteen, and saw the IRA as its army This, together with its revolutionary and conspiratorial tradition, posed difficulties  for those who sought to build on the democratic authority, conferred by Sinn Fe/in 's electoral success and the creation of Da/il E/ireann But Sinn Fe/in was itself regarded, less as a political party than as the civilian and subordinate wing of the independence movement, and there were many members of both the IRA and the IRB in it", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "ae61081c-2373-4be8-983e-706a328b9117", "added":

{"text": "<QUB Inaugural>\n\n\n<$A> Don't know why I poured that I won't be able to drink it Vice Chancellor, Mrs Beveridge, Dean, thank-you for your gracious introduction, my family and friends, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen As I sat in front of a blank computer screen the other evening, having postponed this joyous occasion for as long as was joy as decently possible, I was forcefully reminded of the wise words of Richard Whately, the Archbishop of Dublin when this university was in its infancy,  preach not because you have to say something but only if you have something to say  This admonition still troubles me I don't mind telling you When I was at school, for one reason or another, I always seemed to be doing my homework, going down the Falls Road in the bus in the mornings I remember well saying to myself, it won't be like this when I go to Queen 's When that time duly came and I daily took the bus down the Donegall Road I still seemed to be scrambling to prepare for my tutorials in the mornings on the bus Well I didn't exactly write it coming down in the car but uh enough said Apart from telling you something about me and my recent difficulty, this little story illustrates well a truism about people that fits well into the main philosophical part of my lecture later  old habits die hard  I 've attended many inaugural lectures over the years, and I 've observed from this habit that there 're are almost as many styles of inaugural lecture as there are lecturers So what do I have to say I propose to speak under three headings First I want to take this opportunity as is traditional, to acknowledge some of my many debts Secondly, I 'm going to try to communicate my understanding of the enterprise of philosophy as I practise it myself and as I try to inculcate it in my students And finally, all too briefly, I 'm going to do some philosophy and offer a brief analysis of the topics  listed in the title from a philosophical point of view First my debts I 'm very aware that I didn't get to be standing up here today without the support of many people And, dangerous and invidious though it is, I 'd like to single a few of them out To begin with the obvious, it 's practically impossible to succeed in academic life these days such are the pressures to pursue research and publish, while all the time implementing the government 's insane demands to achieve more and more so-called efficiency gains without neglecting one 's partner and family If it is possible by the way will somebody please let me in on the secret It 's no accident that for several centuries, many uh most academics were almost exclusively celibate clerics My long-suffering wife Jean and my children Martin and Eleanor of whom I 'm immensely proud have suffered this neglect with great patience, and I wish to record publicly my gratitude for their unfailing support for me and my work During my undergraduate days at Queen 's one larger-than-life figure stands out Father Theodore Crowley was a Franciscan friar and the University 's first professor of Scholastic Philosophy who introduced me in my first year to the pleasures of both <&French> la vie intellectuelle </&French> and equally importantly Nuits-St George, St E/milion and other nectarious libations  I remember Theodore with deep affection for his love of scholarship and for his irrepressed irrepressible sense of impish fun When later he became my first Head of Department I well remember him saying, I don't mind what area of philosophy you work in as long as you do it well, and try to publish two articles a year I was fortunate enough to have several outstanding teachers at the University of Michigan, including Andreas Papandreou who later made a name for himself in a number of ways, Firthjof Bergmann and Alan Wood They all went out of their way to help me and each of them was in his own way a model for me in my later work and I 'm deeply grateful to them all The second professor of Scholastic Philosophy and my Head of Department for over twelve years was James McEvoy, who left Queen 's in nineteen eighty-nine to take to take up the prestigious chair of Medieval Philosophy at the Universite/ Catholique de Louvain, in Belgium Jim also embodies the very highest standards of scholarship and unfailingly supported me in my philosophical work To him, and to my other colleagues in the Department, two of whom were also my teachers, I owe a great debt of gratitude which I 'm happy to acknowledge publicly today Incidentally, and I mention this since some colleagues have wondered about it, when I was awarded a Chair it was simply inappropriate to use the title of the Chair previously uh held previously by Professors Crowley and McEvoy since I have never been a Scholastic Philosopher, hence the somewhat duller title which I 'm honoured to bear, Professor of Philosophy There are other more intangible but all-pervasive debts The one person whose absence on this occasion I regret more than anything else is my late father He would have derived great satisfaction from this occasion And then there 's my mother There 's nothing I can say here about how much I owe her that she doesn't know already I was the first in my family to go to a university, but my family 's connection with Queen 's goes back much further than that You may remember Vice Chancellor you were curious when I said I had a long-standing family connection with Queen 's Well with her encouragement the truth can now be told When my mother came from County Leitrim to Belfast as a teenage girl during the war, her first job in Belfast was as a live-in domestic assistant in Riddle Hall, which in those days was a residential hall for young ladies Of course today the headquarters of the Arts Council So although I was the first to attend university my family connections with Queen 's go back over fifty years Among many many many other gifts, I owe my mother a love of books a love of learning and a love of our Irish culture <&Irish> A mha/thair di/lis, go raibh mi/le maith agat </&Irish>  Turning now to my second section What is philosophy anyway What is philosophy for in the contemporary university Why should students study philosophy and why should taxpayers subsidise philosophy Now there are many styles of doing philosophy, some of them very different from my own, but in my view they are all equally valid, they are all different ways of doing philosophy We philosophers often have great difficulty in communicating with each other, but there should be no room for sectarianism of any kind within philosophy All I can do today is try to communicate to you not just the excitement of philosophical ideas and of following a train of philosophical thought wherever it leads and you never know where it 's going to end up when you embark upon the journey, but also why I believe that philosophy is of central importance in a university curriculum Now philosophy like any other university discipline has its own technical language which can sometimes be almost impenetrable A lot of time as I 've said, I don't understand half of it myself Ms Boyd in her letter to me about my forthcoming lecture, and thank-you Lynne for making all the arrangements, charmingly invited me and I quote, to strike a balance between something indicating the nature of your own original research and something which would be appreciated by those who are not experts in the subject A lot easier said than done Well I note that professional philosophers are greatly outnumbered in the hall and I 've no doubt that they will find much of the remainder of my talk deeply dissatisfying For most of what I 'll have to say is controversial, and I shall not, for lack of time, be supporting many of my claims and assertions with the kinds of detailed evidence and arguments quite properly demanded of philosophy But I do hope to present some aspects of my practice of philosophy in a jargon-free language that if not exactly appreciated will at least be followed by all the non-philosophers present Even by chemical engineers Some philosophers are of the view that the most fundamental questions are questions of knowledge How can we know things with certainty and how can we know we know Others claim that the most fundamental question of philosophy is the question of being Before going any further they would say we must try to grasp the nature of being, of how and why there is something rather than nothing And these questions of epistemology, theory of language, theory of knowledge sorry, and ontology or metaphysics the study of being, have always loomed large in Western philosophy, uh often taken together, and have really dominated European philosophy for the past three hundred and fifty years And Anglo-American so-called analytic philosophy of this generation, indeed for most of this century, has been bewitched by a debate between realism and anti-realism I 'm not going to take time to try to explain that but it 's a debate, it 's a debate about how what is outside our minds is represented by what is in our minds And it 's a debate in which I have not been directly involved Really because I believe it to be quite beside the point, for reasons that might become apparent as we proceed I espouse a third view, namely that the most fundamental questions of philosophy, the questions that most fruitfully provide the starting point for philosophical reflection, precisely because of the kind of situated beings we ourselves are, are questions of ethics And especially questions of social and public ethics since we humans are all inescapably social beings In the graphic phrase of the novelist St E/xupe/ry, human beings are nothing other than a knot of relationships As I think of it and practise it philosophy is above all else about trying to understand the world we live in and the people who inhabit it, not least oneself My version of philosophy emphasises the primacy of the political over metaphysics or epistemology In philosophy I use my reason to try to find my bearings in the world, to try to orientate myself within the communities in which I 'm immersed And I use that word immersed because I 'm never standing at the side of the pool looking at everyone else who 's in the pool, I 'm always immersed in the pool along with everyone else And I also  uh used the word communities in the plural, communities in which I 'm immersed Because I, like everyone, live within and participate in a large number of different communities, from those close to my person such as my family, this university community, which takes up most of my energy these days and this tortured country, however this country is to be defined Then moving outwards, like ripples in a pool, to wider and more distant communities which include places I have never visited, places such as Rwanda, South Africa, Vietnam And the ripples go out as far as the community of all human beings who have lived and who will live Another way of summarising this thought is to say that we are all inserted in history For me the purpose of philosophy is to identify good choices, which in turn will help to guide right action Philosophy helps an individual to answer questions such as, who am I What am I doing here, Is there a purpose in living that will give me satisfaction How should I comport myself vis-a\\-vis other people, vis-a\\-vis other aspects of nature What would be a just or a good or a well-ordered society How do I live a good life as a good citizen How should I contribute to making a good society This all requires the exercise of what Aristotle called practical reason",

{"text": "<Graduation>\n\n\n<$A> Vice Chancellor, honorary graduate, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure and privilege to welcome you all to this graduation ceremony in Queen 's, This is an important occasion for all of us, the Reverend Doctor Hurley, graduands, their relatives and friends, and for staff, as it marks the end of another academic year in Queen 's This is a happy occasion, a day of celebration to mark the award of degrees to graduates in the Faculty of Education Queen 's is pleased to play host to everyone today and to entertain you this afternoon at the garden party in the quadrangle This is a special occasion for different groups of people this afternoon First of all, could I address a few words to the parents and relatives of today 's graduands This is a proud and important day for every one of you, a day to celebrate the completion of another stage in your child 's education, a day when you hope that they will soon become financially independent , The graduands should be grateful for all the support that has been provided to them during the time of their education, not just at Queen 's but also at school Without the support of their families many student would find it impossible to complete their education successfully So I hope afterwards that the graduands will remember to thank their parents for the support that they have given them For many of you that support will continue, maybe not in financial terms, but in continued interest in your future careers Queen 's graduation ceremonies have been held in this the Sir William Whitla Hall since it opened in nineteen forty-nine I attended my first graduation ceremony on the seventh of July nineteen fifty-five when I obtained a degree in physiology The programme for that uh uh date, and I still have my uh sample, uh the programme for that date does not compare with the bright, glossy, Technicolor publication that you have all received today This programme does not even say if there was a graduation address, and I cannot remember if one was given Clearly it cannot have left a lasting impression on me , It may well be that the that the parents of some of today 's graduands were students at Queen 's in the nineteen fifties, and will remember taking examinations, attending formal dinners, or graduating in this hall If you have not had contact with Queen 's in the intervening period you might be surprised at the many changes that have taken place In nineteen fifty-two, six hundred and twenty-four students started courses in Queen 's, and forty years later in nineteen ninety-two this had increased to just over two and a half thousand In nineteen fifty-two the total undergraduate population at Queen 's was about two thousand seven hundred This past year there were eight and a half thousand students as undergraduates and another fifteen hundred postgraduate students giving a total student population in the university of around ten thousand In nineteen fifty-two there were two graduation ceremonies This year there will be nine, with a total of two and a half thousand students graduating This growth of the student population at Queen 's has been accompanied by many other changes to the university The number of professors has increased, from forty-five to a hundred and twelve, but not in proportion to the increase in students Most of the old buildings around the quadrangle have been retained,  their use although their use has changed The library where you may have studied has been refurbished and is now most impressive but still retains its old character The old Students ' Union building  where you 'd have met with students from all faculties, played billiards and possibly attended a Saturday night hop, now houses the School of Music In the last thirty years the University has built much new accommodation for teaching and research within a short distance of this hall, on the Lisburn, Malone and Stranmillis Roads It 's also purchased in many and and now owns many houses and other buildings in this neighbourhood All are used by staff and students The total value of the Queen 's estate is now over two hundred and fifty million pounds Queen 's is currently engaged in an active programme of refurbishment of buildings to provide the best environment for future students Queen 's has put a particular effort into the provision of purpose-built residential accommodation for its students The halls of residence are probably known to many here today, but it is probably not known that in the past five years Queen 's have provided over four hundred new study bedrooms for students We are proud of this new accommodation, and I am pleased to say that the next eighteen months, we will be providing a hundred and twenty more study bedrooms in refurbished properties in Mount Charles, some two hundred yards from the University Although there 's been such a marked increase in student numbers, there has been no diminution in the University 's commitment to the maintenance of high quality scholarship and research When this university was established in eighteen forty-five as the Queen 's College Belfast there were three faculties, Arts, in which there were scientific and literary divisions, Medicine and Law, indicating the commitment to education in general and to vocational training Queen 's has continued to develop its commitment, both to scholarship and to vocational training, although there 's now a closer relationship between them Education programmes within the University have continued to be developed, to take account of the skills required by our graduates through new courses such as law and accounting, information management, European Community studies, and computer science with business administration Within degree programmes a wide variety of courses are provided to broaden the training of our students One example is the non  specialist language teaching programme where fourteen language courses ranging from French German and Spanish, to Arabic, Mandarin Chinese and Japanese, are provided at various levels from beginners to post A-level Last year over twelve hundred students from all faculties, including Medicine and Engineering, took the above courses, Thus Queen 's is moving with the times and responding to the needs of our students to equip them not only with the education but  with the skills they will require in the development of their careers, Turning to the graduands, I offer you my congratulations on the successful completion of your university career Today marks one of the most important days of your life, the day when your formal education has been completed, and after a few weeks ' well-deserved holiday, you look forward to embarking on your career Collectively, you 're a high quality workforce who are about to  who are about to embark on the development of future generation of pupils in Northern Ireland and perhaps further afield We are fortunate that the quality of entrants to the teaching profession in Northern Ireland is still high compared to England and Wales The entrance requirements for the Bachelor of Education course are as high as those for most other courses in Queen 's or any other university It is most important that these highly intelligent, well-trained professional teachers are used to maximum effect in their chosen profession I wish to emphasise to everyone here the most important role that today 's graduands will have in the development of many aspects of the lives of young people in Northern Ireland, and in the future of Northern Ireland itself It will be your role to teach the children who will be the future students at this and many other universities, and those graduates will in turn contribute to our future Those pupils who do not go to university require to be educated to the highest possible standard to contribute to the world scene and not just Northern Ireland The maintenance of our standards not only in education but in many aspects of our lives in the years ahead will be in your hands, Life will not be comfortable or straightforward Teaching is not an easy option whether you 're teaching a class of five year olds or fifteen year olds, especially if the latter are not interested in education And it 's easier to lecture to a group of highly motivated university students for a few hours a day than to get a class of young children from nine a-m to four pm, particularly during your first year when you are uh when you are set classes during the day, and preparation work at night, life will seem to be very hard But look at the satisfaction that will come from teaching, in seeing the development of your pupils until they end up at university even as a professor or a vice chancellor at your old university Unfortunately you will find that some people do not hold the teaching profession in high regard I find this impossible to understand as often the children of these critics have benefited from high quality education The attitude of the public to the teaching profession must be changed, How can this be achieved It may stem from jealousy arising from the apparently long holidays, but these are required to give you respite from the work of the other nine months One might expect the government to provide a lead, but this is unlikely as it seems to be against all the professions, law, medicine, universities and teachers, as you may have noticed from all the changes that have been introduced in these professions in recent years The solution probably lies in your own hands, by demonstrating to your pupils and to their parents the importance of education You all will fulfil a most important role not only in the in the education, but also in the development of many generations of students This is the message you should try to convey to your pupils and their parents but it will not be easy How do you wish to be remembered uh by your pupils Children have strong ideas about the kind of teachers they like Surveys since the nineteen thirties have shown that children prefer teachers who are slightly strict, but not severe not over-severe or permissive, who treat them as individuals, who are fair in their use of punishments and rewards, and who have a sense of humour without being sarcastic Look back at the teachers who influenced your education I 'd expect that most of them would have had these qualities The teachers I can remember forty years later are the ones who influenced me and most would 've had these characteristics, Today does not mark the end of your education It is only the end of your formal education Your education will and in fact must continue during your professional life Continuing education is essential to cope with the advances and changes that will inevitably occur It is not so long ago that calculations were done with slide rules and log tables, but electronic calculators and computers have replaced them, and who knows what will be available in thirty years ' time Postgraduate students in Queen 's are now expected to submit their work prepared on a word processor using Harvard Graphics Will this one day replace handwriting in the school classroom Will advances in information technology make our libraries redundant or only uh place for storing books while you read the script on laptop computers But in addition you 'll have to contend with the many changes imposed by a government, which seems determined to introduce reform too rapidly without proper evaluation, and without adequate financial support I hope that you will all partake of the in-service education opportunities offered through an integrated approach by the faculty of education and the two uh colleges St Mary 's and Stranmillis, Currently about nine hundred teachers are enrolled for the diploma in advanced study of education, the advanced certificate course and the master of education course This means that members of the faculty of education had developed close contacts with schools over a long period of time which resulted in a coherent and strong informal relationship being developed It is this relationship that will will facilitate changes in teacher education This will be the last uh graduation ceremony for the faculty of education to be attended by Doctor Rogers in his position as principal of Stranmillis College, as he will be retiring in the autumn", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "fb6d356d-b4a0-420a-b7df-54c90011a56a", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.427489+00:00"}
{"text": "<QUB Doctorate>\n\n\n<$A> Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, Mr Nesbitt, graduands, ladies and gentlemen, it is with considerable humility that I address you today I am very honoured that this great university, which I have always held in very high regard, should see fit to confer on me an honorary doctorate When I consider the list of distinguished people upon whom this honour has been conferred in the long history of the University it does indeed make one very humble I would like to thank the Chancellor, whom I have known and admired for many years for his conduct of the ceremony, and Mr Nesbitt for his citation I 'm still blushing and embarrassed Was totally undeserved, but at the same time very much appreciated He certainly has done his research unknown to me I thought today was going to be one of those days when although one was a principal participant all one had to do was to look pleasant and pleased, but no more However knowing the Vice Chancellor, I should have appreciated that I was unlikely to get away just as lightly as that A few weeks ago, I received a letter asking me to address the graduands and guests, drawing on my own criteria and experience of life But firstly, could I congratulate the graduands here today As the Chancellor said you have worked hard, you have earned your reward For my part the closest I ever came to attending this great university in an academic sense was to sit my matriculation examination in this very building just down about there I still remember the place Like Mr Major, I cannot remember my exact results  I won't aspire to saying they were good I know they weren't Uh, however I passed, but instead of progressing to a degree course I went to work as an articled clerk, and in due course uh became a chartered accountant As a little anecdote of that time, which was toward the end of the last war, as I said we sat the matriculation examination in this hall, it was surrounded by scaffolding, it had a very rough concrete floor, bare walls, the gallery was held up by scaffolding, this platform was not here, there was no heating, we had to wear about three sweaters, a topcoat and gloves with the ink freezing in the inkpots The biro hadn't been invented then, I can assure you that the conditions today are much more pleasant and it 's much more pleasant to be here in the present circumstances than then Earlier I congratulated the graduands saying that you had earned your great reward as indeed you have Probably at this moment you feel as I did when I qualified as a chartered accountant You feel that the world is your oyster, you can kick it around just as you wish However it did not take long to realise that the world is a tough, unforgiving and unrelenting master Today it is probably even more difficult for you, with greater competition to find the fewer jobs that are available I was delighted to hear the Chancellor say that only nine percent of the graduates of this great university are left as they leave uh the university without employment Now about some of my criteria for life First I would like to speak about opportunity and challenge Mr Nesbitt kindly referred to these uh in his citation Many of you may be seeking employment in the academic world, and finding that there are dozens of applicants for every position Similarly with public service I personally regret seeing so much of our excellent young talent striving for  for positions in the law, the civil service, local government, teaching or academia, and ignoring the more exciting if initially perhaps less secure opportunity that industry can provide Long gone are the days of the old satanic mills Today the bulk of our manufacturing industry is highly technical using the most modern techniques and the most modern developments in computer technology and technology generally Industry needs young graduates like you to cope with modern technology, prepared at first to go onto the factory floor, as a precursor to a career in management There are probably more opportunities today in manufacturing industry than elsewhere And it is only by attracting people who have been trained to think, that British industry will be able to compete in the modern world With sales and marketing, production, engineering, training, administration and general management, the range is tremendously wide The scope and opportunity for travel is tremendous also I personally have been privileged to enjoy two careers in my life, one in service industry and the other in manufacturing My first career as you have heard was in accounting which I thoroughly enjoyed My second was in manufacturing industry, with all the romance and excitement of machinery and technology, and above all the satisfaction of producing an end product You have a great advantage if at the outset you know what you want to do and feel that you have a vocation As Mr Nesbitt said in the citation I knew I wanted to be a chartered accountant, I knew where I wanted to work, but that was just a sort of boyish dream seeing the gilt lettering on the, on the window However I  cajoled my father who hadn't a clue about accountancy or indeed about <unclear> 2 sylls </unclear> to try to arrange that I got an interview with the principal partner To his credit, he got me that interview and thereafter it was up to me Fortunately I succeeded, and was recruited at then the handsome salary of ten shillings a week, which is fifty p in modern parlance There 's an old cliche/ which says, some people live to work, others work to live But the more important thing to my mind is that you should enjoy your work If you resent what you 're doing you will never be a success and my advice is to seek the opportunity to work at a job to which you can relate and which will give you pleasure and satisfaction You 're going to spend the greater part of your life at work and to do so in a job that you dislike can be nothing else but demotivating and depressing When in your job, strive to do it well and accept every challenge that comes along Every challenge that you accept provides an opportunity, an opportunity to prove yourself, and in my own case I do not believe that I ever passed up a challenge I found it very difficult Indeed at a late stage in my career and when I decided that the time had come, the time that Mr Nesbitt has referred to the time had come to give myself a little space, I accepted the challenge to privatise Northern Ireland Electricity At first it was an uphill task, but I have personally taken great satisfaction from the success of the privatisation within the past few weeks We 've still a lot to achieve in Northern Ireland Electricity uh and a lot to prove, but it has been a great challenge and great satisfaction from it, Nearly thirty years ago, I, having done my homework, decided that, there was great scope in Northern Ireland for a computer bureau, and I decided that, as an accountant that Northern Ireland needed just such a facility There were few computers if any, in Northern Ireland at that time I decided to approach the, the government, I thought it a good idea They had an enterprise fund at that time with half a million pounds in it I uh saw the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Commerce, told him what I wanted, he shuffled amongst his papers, produced a green paper and asked me had I read it And I said no The green paper was entitled, The Future for Computer Bureaux in Northern Ireland The decision that that paper came to was that there was no future thirty years ago for computer bureaux in Northern Ireland And Vice Chancellor it was before your time that the signatories to that White Paper were some notable names from this great university Uh I will say that they were in the academic world However, because I was satisfied and had the courage of my own convictions and had done my homework, we proceeded, with the computer bureaux And that company is still in existence, employs nearly three hundred people in Northern Ireland a day, is owned by an American firm and trades throughout the world And it gives again great satisfaction and pleasure from seeing its success But the point I want to make is that if you have the courage of your convictions, go ahead accept the challenge and do the job Preparing for your graduation you have learned to define objectives, to assess information, to work independently, and therefore using those skills you should be able to recognise opportunity when it presents itself If you are satisfied that the opportunity presents you with a task which you can do well, that you can enjoy and that will promote you as an individual, grasp it, put your entire self into it and I can assure you that you will receive your recognition and reward But always remember that you are in a competitive world If you fail to make the effort necessary, there is always someone else out there waiting to grasp your opportunity On the other hand never allow failure to divert you If you fail initially in your objectives use the experience gained Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and get on with the next task The Americans are wonderful at this They have the ability to drive forward despite setbacks, which perhaps you and I would consider as disasters From my days as a practising accountant I have always had a great admiration, for a friend and one of my clients, his business failed through no fault of his own But he picked himself up and set about retrieving it, and is now an international organisation trading throughout the world Tremendous success has followed the failure, and that man, and that experience in his life benefited him thereafter In my own career, I 've had a few near-disasters also In Lamont Holdings which was referred to, I set out with Lamont Holdings to form it into a financial services industry company, in the second half of the seventies We unfortunately were just ahead of our time, it nearly turned into a disaster, but we re-formed, retrieved the situation, turned it into a textile company and now it employs nearly two thousand people uh here in Northern Ireland, in France and in Great Britain, and is a successful uh public limited company So as I say nearly a disaster but, by re-forming, again having the courage of your convictions one can take the, accept the challenge and take the opportunity Now my second point, enthusiasm and commitment Life can be very boring if you 're not enthusiastic about it You have worked hard, you 've the ability to communicate, you 've knowledge and you 've achieved the first target in your career, graduation Now you have to turn all that to your own advantage In being articulate you have the ability to express yourself But I 'd urge that when you do so, do it with enthusiasm and conviction Life is a marketplace In it, it is necessary to sell your own abilities, and it is only when you 've established a track record of success that people will beat their way to your door It 's up to you to achieve that record of success I often think in Britain today that some business people have become somewhat cosy, satisfied with a certain standard of achievement, but not prepared to go that extra mile to obtain the pleasure enjoyment and satisfaction of a further goal or another challenge Complacency is something you should always be wary of It will get you nowhere and may indeed lead to failure", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Universities>\n\n\n<$A> Chancellor of the University, I think your choice was right in the first place Peter Magee would have , given us a much better address Ladies and gentlemen, Chancellor of the university, a long time ago uh Francis Bacon was wise enough to write uh  for knowledge itself is power  A university is a place which garners and stores knowledge, so in that sense it is a powerful place This knowledge uh be it the know-how to design and build an engine, or the precise location of a particular Byzantine  manuscript in a library somewhere in this world is gathered by those who conduct research and then store it in the form of written publications in the international literature All university academics worthy of that title are commissioned by their employer, the university, to conduct research as part of their contract and, having practised their particular profession, be that engineering or medicine or whatever, they will become more expert teachers to the several generations of students who will hear them lecture on their subject during their career in the university Almost by definition, like the rest of the human race, not all academics are equally assiduous or industrious in their research Some are better than others, some work harder than others, some are more inventive than others and some are just plain more intelligent than others Not all of these characteristics reside in  any one person but it 's reasonable to assume that promotion up the academic ladder from lecturer to senior lecturer and so on must indicate that a greater proportion of some or all of these assets must be present, and therefore must be needed for and taken into account for uh that advancement Equally, not all universities contain equality of quality of its academics and so it must be assumed that some universities have smarter professors than others uh viz uh the automatic presumption among the general public that Cambridge University is better than the University of X uh inherently contains that assumption In recent times uh there has been a considerable upsurge in the numbers of those attending, and academically eligible to attend and study at a university The Government at Westminster at a stroke of a pen last year uh made universities out of some forty polytechnics and consequently and instantly provided the United Kingdom with greatly improved  regarding that proportion of its eighteen year old population who will become university graduates Needless to add, the quality of research at these new universities is not in general up to the standards of the older universities for by definition the staff at these establishments were hired originally on quite different criteria and asked to fulfil a quite different purpose Incidentally, the original purpose of a polytechnic was to give a good education to those who were mainly aiming at a technical or technician career, and as such individuals are extremely valuable to industry uh  and the professions, not to speak of invaluable, one wonders where and how the government plans to have them educated in this new academic scenario One can be pretty certain that these new  new universities will not have a long-term wish to have any involvement with the teaching of low-level courses as they would indubitably now see technician courses in their new-found role and environment as a university In many ways, however this is but an aside to my discussion The main point of my debate is to ask the question, does the Government wish to have all of these extra university students taught by expert academics in the fashion of the older established universities so the quality of a university degree obtained at either the University of X or at Cambridge University is reasonably comparable If the answer is yes uh then the ensuing question is, will the Government  and apply the traditional levels of funding of research to these new universities so that the expert teaching may take place in the traditional fashion The current answer to these questions is apparently no Furthermore, it is becoming apparent that the Government is going to selectively fund research at all universities, be they old or new, and thus minimise the extra financial burden caused by the creation of the new universities The mechanism employed by Government is to query the quality of both the teaching and the research at all universities and then only fund adequately those academic disciplines and departments of any university which is deemed to be above a certain standard Further, it would appear that the pot of research gold as we might call it, for the totality of all universities is ultimately going to be fixed, and so even the best of the universities in terms of, and due to, its perceived research quality is inevitably going to see a reduction of its Government funding for research The current position is that the perceived research quality of two cost centres at Queen 's University is graded at the very highest level, where it 's   called grade five, several at grade four, and a very considerable fraction of the remainder at the median grade three, some thirty percent or so are graded two or lower The funding given by government on the quality research rating criteria is very punitive, as the ratio is set at grade level minus one, thus a department graded two gets a unitary related amount of money for research and one graded five gets four times as much in cash terms The outcome, as predicted above, is less government funding for research to Queen 's University There 's also  an  an extra element of funding for development of research areas which is quite unique to the two Northern Ireland universities and but which will exist for only a few years ahead How should this or indeed any university react to these changing circumstances Should it bolster those areas and departments which are currently rated most highly, and also those which seem likely to improve their position in any future, uh well in the future research  selectivity assessment exercises The next one actually is officially forecast to take place in nineteen ninety-five The consequence of that is, by definition, a withdrawal of financial support to those departments not deemed likely to succeed in these same future research selectivity exercises The phraseology employed to describe the future of such sections of the university is that they will become quote, teaching-only, unquote, departments If you remember my previous view that as good research by the academic leads to expertise in teaching then so too by definition does the mere regurgitation of the work of others lead to less able teaching In short, would you as a parent wish your son or daughter, or you as a graduate wish, to go to a university and study for a degree at a department which is rated at, teaching-only Potentially, future employers may also ask the graduate not only what grade of honours degree was obtained, but in what quality of department was it studied The alternative strategy is for the university to attempt to strengthen research in all areas of the university so that each and every one will reach the median research selectivity rating of three From a financial standpoint having fifty percent of the university graded four and above, and the rest as two or below, is roughly perhaps even exactly the same in financial terms That will leave the parent or potential undergraduate with a clear decision that the standard of the university in question was evenly spread throughout and the teaching culture and the service teaching sector was at least as good as in the primary discipline Incidentally, the mean research grade three is supposed to represent research that equates to attainable levels of national excellence in a majority of the sub-areas of activity or to international levels in some, which which nomenclature sounds pretty good as an achievement if it was not for the punitive financial factoring associated with it In   terms Queen 's University had thirty-one of its forty-nine areas, they 're actually called cost centres, rated at grade three or better However, this particular method of dealing with the financial problem and altering the research profile of a university in effects means removing resources from those departments which have been highly successful with research and distributing it distributing it to those who are not so proficient, which seems scant reward for being successful However the gardeners among you may tell me that the best way to get a rose to bloom again and again is to prune it as well as to feed it with fertiliser The audience may well ask why this new system of funding research which is being introduced for the first time is so punitive in arithmetic terms One would certainly hope that the government teams conducting the selectivity exercise got it absolutely right, for all areas surveyed in all universities For any mistakes made will inevitably lead to a diminution of academic status in national international terms and a reduced potential for the attraction of further research funds from industry or government Even a brilliant researcher operating in a cost centre among much less able or industrious colleagues, but who are collectively rated as grade two, say, will find that the government agencies such as the research councils will tar him with a low grade-point brush, and be much less likely to judge his research application for funding, purely on the merit or quality of that written application In this situation the loss of self-confidence and esteem to an able academic could be very destructive psychologically and lead ultimately to a significant lowering of his performance in research The current strategy which this university is adopting is to attempt to have more than fifty percent of its cost centres rated at grade four or better in the next research selectivity rating exercise in nineteen ninety-five Strong and selective support funding will be applied to assist with that process By definition that means that quite a few areas of this university will not be assisted financially in this manner and it must be expected that they will fare poorly in the next round of research assessment Only time will tell if this is the correct strategy for the University to adopt, considering the levels of funding provided by Government More importantly for the country, is the Government 's strategy correct However, from the viewpoint of the graduates sitting in front of me and their parents as well, it is important to note that at this point in time you have completed this phase of your education and training in an establishment with a strong research and development record Further it is a university which quite uniquely and very successfully applies its R and D into the technology transfer mode In such centres to single out but two, as the Northern Ireland Technology Centre and Questor, Queen 's University serves the local community in a most significant manner In the Northern Ireland Technology Centre some thirty-three people provide design and development services to local industry, including the design and manufacture of specialist machines for the production environment Our engineering students uh are taught computer-aided design on the most modern workstations and software in this highly relevant atmosphere The personnel provide the basis for the advisory service to industry which orchestrates the certification of local companies through the quality assurance British Standard BS five seven five o And the bottom line is that their external earnings for all this activity is over two million pounds per annum The Questor Centre is a research partnership between the university and industry, a quite unique one investigating practical solutions to environmental problems It is based primarily on chemistry but its remit extends significantly into the biological sciences It is to be hoped that you will, all of you will be successful in your future careers, even in these difficult times with industry in the widest sense of that word in recession This means that graduate employment is not the bustling exercise that it has been hitherto I wish you well in your search for the right opening into a career which will bring you satisfaction and advancement This day is one which marks the successful end of  your of your university degree course The parents will naturally and rightly feel a glow of pride as you ascend the steps to receive your just award, just reward, and award Many will have made significant sacrifices to ensure your success on this day That too is as natural as it is commendable May I congratulate you all and thank you for your attendance and your attention", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "c2834f93-3497-4a15-89f3-89d0c03f625c", "added":

{"text": "<Unionist politics>\n\n\n<$A> Well thank-you very much Mr Chairman I came to this process back in the dim distant past in June, with no baggage, solely the belief that for future generations to enjoy the citizenship which we 're all currently enjoying, it was time for unionism to engage To my horror, members, the , my fears over the process which I had hoped was a mere manifestation of what 's been described as my siege mentality were all but true Both governments ', members, and just pause and let the full significance of that phrase sink in, both governments, embarked upon our process with a clear outcome in mind To that end, and that 's the end of the framework documents, both the ground-rule documents and the scenario paper of the sixth of June were produced and laid before us at Stormont as fait accompli Well those of us who were there know what followed all too well Late nights, many many hours poring over document after document after document after document Given the number of trees we kill producing paper, the Green Party must be turning in its electoral grave, but the net result of all that was a little booklet, this book here of forty-four paragraphs They asked this in the recess, I was asked by an English journalist writing for the Independent paper, whether all the hours of bluster and brinkmanship and steadfast defence of our positions was worth it And I said yes, of course it was worth it, for the sole reason that the principle that the sovereignty of the process needs to belong to those who are engaged in the process had been defended And that is the result of the pre-summer bluster at Stormont The people who are round the table in Castle Buildings have now the chance to determine the outcome of those talks Not an Anglo-Irish set of procedures designed for an Anglo-Irish outcome, not an Anglo-Irish  jacket to put an Anglo-Irish Agreement Mark Two in front of our people, but the chance, it may be a slim chance, but a chance for the delegates of the people of Northern Ireland to have some say for the first time in a generation and a half, of their future Having come to the foundations of an equitable process, where do we go now Should we move to substantive talks And we have clearly pointed the way to that move in our document as issued at the weekend Should we move to substantive uh talks, let everybody be clear of our objectives If Ms McWilliams had deemed this chamber with her  her presence now at half past three I would be happy to tell her about our vision Our vision as Ulster Unionists Mr Chairman, is of a Northern Ireland where all our people from whatever tradition, can live free from the threat of violence We believe strongly Mr Chairman in a Northern Ireland where democracy not demagoguery rule, a Northern Ireland lifted from the shadow of the gun and at peace with itself, a Northern Ireland secure in a Union which we all cherish, playing a full part in all our nation 's institutions at whatever level That is the challenge That is why Ulster Unionists are engaged in the process That 's why we are encouraged by what progress there has been The process could have died in June Allusion has already been made with the bluster over the chairmanship of Senator George Mitchell The Ulster Unionist party as representatives of the greater number took their position as leaders of the Unionist community seriously We kept, we kept the process alive We are here today because of that  leadership stand Our wish-list of the future cannot come true within the diktat of  of the Anglo-Irish Agreement That has to go and be replaced with a broad, a broadly acceptable form of government That 's why we 're here That is why we 're there We 're not there to give any credence to the notion that the Irish government has a direct role in our affairs We are there to underscore some simple realities in the process of Northern Ireland 's body politic Reality number one is that we deserve the democratic rights accorded to our fellow-citizenships anywhere else in the United Kingdom Reality number two, and this has been touched on at great length, is that constitutional instability begats perpetual conflict Irredentist Irish claims have to go Our government must stand behind our union in the same way it does with the union with Scotland And the final reality, reality number three, is that we are the sum of our whole There are enough people of good will in this province to make our province work and work properly Now that is why we are engaged in the process, and that 's why we are encouraged that we are still here To bury our heads in the sand, to bluster, to stop at every semi-colon, to read sinister intent into every paragraph and every utterance from either government would be to betray our mandate and to betray the people who sent us here That 's why we are there Why are others at Stormont What do we face We face an irredentist Irish line, backed to the hilt by malignant mandarins from Iveagh House We have an SDLP running scared from the Republican Party, and we have, we have I have to say, our own government, so wrapped up in the clothes of appeasement as to be detached from the people it 's meant to be representing and protecting The scales fell from my eyes I thought that as a member of the United Kingdom, as a British citizenship, as a British citizen, I could look to my government and say, <&Latin> civis Britannius sum </&Latin>, protect me, represent my my issue, my interests Certainly not Certainly not What do the Irish Government do What do they do They support the SDLP to the hilt And that is why there 's no SDLP representation here today, and that 's why at Stormont the SDLP are dragging their feet at every opportunity They have no interest in Northern Ireland, they have no interest in any form of government other than government by deceit, the government which has been  practised in this province since nineteen eighty-five The lack of trust between all the participants here at Stormont and in their province as a whole a major major stumbling block for any progress The trust that does not exist between the governments and Unionism has been well documented But what can we do Quite , well that 's in the government 's hands But the lack of trust between Nationalism and Unionism can be addressed by one single simple move There are empty seats here aplenty Where are the SDLP They 're engaged in a process at Stormont But let 's members not forget that this talks process, this Peace Process is not a-la-carte Forum talks, talks forum, those are the same faces of the same coin If the SDLP don't deem it fit to come to this body to discuss bread-and-butter issues, with their fellow elected representatives, surely the day has to come when we have to ask the question, what is the point attempting to work out complex constitutional issues at Stormont with these people I 'll leave that hanging In the order, in order to bridge that gap, in order to bridge the credibility gap which Nationalism and militant Republicanism leaves us, I implore them to come here Members on this side have made the point very ably today, that there 's no bar on Sinn Fe/in entering this chamber, no bar at all And quite simply, I lay the gauntlet down, come here, come here now, no ceasefire required Come here now and try and argue democratically your position You cannot do it I would say to  the SDLP, come here and argue your position democratically without the support of the Irish government and without the support of northern militant Republicanism They won't do it The sad truth is Mr Chairman, what progress there has been at Stormont has been despite the irredentist claim of the Irish government and despite the total disinterest of Nationalists in an internal Northern Ireland solution Many many times I an I as a Unionist am berated to look at South Africa I look at South Africa and what is the lesson The lesson is without trust there can be no progress How can there be trust when people won't come here and talk to us It begs the question, are these people serious about this process or is John Hume and his cohorts more interested in, in pan-Nationalism than they are in a future for us all in Northern Ireland I want an agreement that threatens no-one I want to believe the rhetoric coming out of Londonderry But I wonder, I really wonder if the, if what is on offer from Nationalism is acceptable If I was to stop being a Unionist then uh the Agreement would threaten no-one But that 's all that 's on offer We are offered a neutered Assembly with dangerous dangerous Trojan Horse links with the Irish Republic We are offered institutions with a sinister dynamism We are offered a a world vision that plays up false North South links but ignores East West links It 's only until the reality of the politics of Northern Ireland is grasped by those who are holding up progress can substantial negotiations achieve something We 're not here, or we 're not at Stormont to block things We are definitely here as the representatives of the greater number to advance our province and to advance the future of our province I ask everybody who was elected to join us and do that We 've shown leadership over the chairmanship of George Mitchell, we 've shown leadership over decommissioning, and we 'll show leadership  as this progress, as this process continues I hope to God it does progress and if it doesn't, it won't be any fault of Ulster Unionism Thank-you very much\n\n\n<$B> Thank-you Mr Chairman First of all let me say, as a believer in unionist unity, I don't intend to use any of my time during this  to snipe at other Unionists I don't think that 's a productive use of our time Mr Chairman, there are those, there are many people in this, in this uh this country who would say that these talks shouldn't be happening, uhm and in one sense I would  tend to agree with them If this Government was running Northern Ireland as it should be run, there would be no need for any multi-party talks But unfortunately we don't have such a government We have a Government that signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement, that gave a foreign government a say in our internal affairs The poison of that Agreement is still affecting this country day by day We have a Government that has destroyed local democracy by quangos and putting their placemen in place For any true Conservative who looks at the record of this government over the last seventeen years, they should regard uh the Conservative government 's role in Northern Ireland as a badge of shame We need dialogue because the status quo is unacceptable Now on that one small point I agree with Mo Mowlam, although I would think for very different reasons than she would, she came out with that statement There is an opportunity in these talks to change things for the better There is an opportunity to reach an understanding between Unionists and Nationalists However, for that opportunity to be grasped, I think that we need three things to happen First of all, we need a change of attitude on behalf of the British government At times the British government has tended to behave like a  uh like a feudal landlord The most obvious example of this being the high-handed nature of the government happened over the summer with Drumcree, and Northern Ireland paid a terrible price for that blunder But, it is not just a question of Drumcree This high-handed attitude by the British Government has been seen in these talks At the start of these talks the British Government came in with a set of rules of procedure and the ground-rules document, which they 'd set forward to establish on these talks Had these documents been accepted, the effect would have been to give a, a, to slant the talks in favour of the Nationalists and Republican agenda And Unionists had to fight for a proper set of procedures line by line and it took a number of weeks Uhm, at times change was very slow It was like drawing teeth But eventually we were able to get an acceptable form of procedures Now, and this has been a sign I think of these talks Every time Unionists have stood up and they have fought for an issue which they have felt to be important, we 've been sniped at by others in saying that this is just a waste of time But we 've thought long and hard to ensure that these talks were held on a level playing-field And I think at least as regards to procedures we 've succeeded on that But there has to be a radical change of attitude from the British government They 've got to realise that the process is uh owned by all the participants and not just themselves Secondly there 's got to be a change of  uh, on the stance of the British and Irish governments on decommissioning If their proposals that they produced at the beginning of this week were accepted, the effect would be to put

{"text": "<English literature>\n\n\n<$A> I 'm going to look at the concept of English Literature with reference to some Irish contexts both inside and outside the universities I will keep Queen 's University and Northern Irish contexts particularly in view Since the nineteen seventies approaches to Irish literature and to its links with something called English literature had been affected like so much else by the conflict in Northern Ireland This is nothing new Shortly after the Easter Rising W B Yeats lamented  at the moment I feel that all the work of years has been overturned, all the freeing of Irish literature and criticism from politics  In fact, as Yeats was well aware, Irish literature and criticism have rarely been politics-free But this set of relations has fluctuated historically and is being read today in a variety of ways I return to that point later on Of course readings of Irish literature have also been affected over the years by intellectual events outside Ireland At the moment the primary influence from abroad is that of European and Anglo-American literary theory One result of the theoretical revolution has been attention to the history of English literature as an academic discipline Books published on that topic since nineteen eighty-three include Chris Baldick 's The Social Mission of English Criticism, Gerald Graff 's Professing Literature, Franklin Court 's Institutionalising Literature Eighteen Forty-Eight to Nineteen Hundred and Robert Crawford 's Devolving English Literature These books are concerned in different ways with the politics of English literary studies With the ideologies that have shaped English departments ' literary criticism and the canons constructed by university syllabuses In other words which texts got taught where by whom, why, and how And which texts didn't Hence the many critiques of the canon from the viewpoint of gender and race So far these questions have not been systematically brought home to Northern Ireland and Queen 's On the other hand although Ireland flickers in and out of general debates about the literary academy those debates themselves only patchily incorporate Irish perspectives In Devolving English Literature written from a Scottish perspective Robert Crawford notes that major literary theorists have tended to avoid questions of cultural identity Obviously in Northern Ireland cultural identity begs another set of complex questions which are part of my concern this evening In fact Crawford 's remark complements the devolutionary emphasis of Franklin Court 's Institutionalising English Literature Court stresses the me/lange of historical contexts that have informed the discipline Like Crawford he points out that English literature was actually invented by the Scots, um mainly by Adam Smith as an instrument of self-improvement and as a corrective to the anti-social tendencies of laissez-faire capitalism I don't think Margaret Thatcher knows that Thus Court 's book focuses on the agendas that have operated or clashed within a range of academic institutions in Scotland England and Ireland I 'll be comparing a few agendas that figured in late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Irish environments and highlighting some factors that have conditioned the relation between English Literature and Irish Studies at Queen 's I hope finally that this brief history may be relevant to the university 's reflections on its own cultural identity and role in the community The current argument in the Queen 's update between humanists and utilitarians tends to dodge local challenges to both these educational philosophies What after all is liberal humanism in Ireland If it exists its history might differ from that of humanism in England And can vocational skills be pursued without regard to cultural literacy In Adam Smith 's terms how much has cultural illiteracy cost Northern Ireland Leslie Clarkson has referred to courses at Queen 's that address objectively and directly the nature of divided societies and mentioned the part played by Irish Studies But the latter in all their aspects and arguments should surely be at the centre of the University 's self-understanding That they are not is shown by Professor Clarkson 's sentence about two cultures differentiated by religion, political loyalties, history, language and traditions On the one hand Irish Studies variously complicate the dualistic model he invokes On the other, objectivity is itself a contested point Further there is a delicate issue which has hung over Queen 's for many years, as to whether the University should simply remain passive or neutral with respect to the assumptions with which students enter its gates, or whether it should do more to raise critical consciousness and to diversify cultural horizons And what about the staff themselves, To support the idea that what goes on in a school of English is indeed relevant to these matters, I 'd like to quote the testimony of two poet graduates also honorary graduates of Queen 's, John Hewitt and Seamus Heaney The phrase Foreign Oasis in my title is taken from John Hewitt 's essay of nineteen forty-five, The Bitter Gourd Some Problems The Ulster Writer This is Hewitt 's bitter word for Queen 's Another factor of some importance in the writer 's mesh of problems has been the part played by the university in our corporate life Staffed perforce largely by English and Scots it has remained culturally a foreign oasis amongst us Creative effort has been allowed to go its own way unregarded Throughout the institution in the past, little or no attention had been given to the fact that although Queen 's is one of the red brick universities it is in Ulster, with its own peculiar conditioning factors Universities are not absolutely necessary to the evocation and shaping of imaginative excellence, but at certain times they have played a significant part rather by influence and atmosphere than by direct interference By the way Hewitt says that Queen 's historians and anthropologists at that date had done a better job than the English Department Seamus Heaney is another poet much occupied by the relations and tensions between roots and reading In an article in Fortnight he stylised his double life as a student of English Far from the elegances of Oscar Wilde and the profundities of Shakespeare I was acting with the Bellaghy Dramatic Society in plays about seventeen ninety-eight, now playing a United Irishman now playing Robert Emmett, In fact this is a false opposition As we shall see the study of Shakespeare let alone Oscar Wilde has been influenced by the Irish question More recently Heaney provided a snapshot of Belfast in nineteen sixty-three which suggests that he has digested Hewitt 's  bitter gourd  Belfast at that time had no literary publishers no poetry readings no sense of a literary identity  In nineteen sixty-two while a student at St Joseph 's College of Education I had done an extended essay on the history of literary magazines in Ulster as though I were already seeking a basis for faith in the possibility of our cultural existence as Northern, Irish, and essentially ourselves It comes as something of a shock nowadays  Heaney says  to remember that during four years as an undergraduate in the Queen 's University English Department I had not ever been taught by an Irish or an Ulster voice  And he goes on to imply that Irish literature uh didn't appear on the syllabus Heaney himself of course was later an Ulster voice in the English Department and it should be said that the proportion of accents amongst Queen 's academic staff has varied according to economic, social and political circumstances since the inception of Queen 's College in eighteen forty-five Nonetheless, the absence noted by the two poets had ideological consequences up to the nineteen sixties and the advent of John Cronin It may be a happy ending and the poetry of Heaney and Hewitt together with much other Irish writing now contributes to the rich modular mix offered by the School of English However, the eclecticism of modularity can produce its own kinds of apartheid More broadly the work of Hewitt, Heaney and other Northern Irish poets has brought into the foreground the intersection between Northern Ireland and literary canons, literary history, literary criticism It 's no longer possible to see English or Irish literature as a discipline detached from our immediate surroundings if either ever was As a perspective on this intersection I want to sketch the canonical and political agendas of three professors of English in Ireland, They are, Edward Dowden, Professor at Trinity College from eighteen sixty-seven to nineteen thirteen, F S Boas an Ulsterman who was professor at Queen 's for four years in the early nineteen hundreds, and his successor the Scot Gregory Smith who held the Chair until nineteen thirty I 'll also mention the important debate between Dowden and Yeats and say a word about Daniel Corkery, professor at University College Cork from nineteen thirty-one, In institutionalising English literature Franklin Court sees Dowden as unusually political even in the later nineteenth-century climate which ensured that quote the mainstream tradition of English literary study had become tacitly more Nationalist and conservative The politics of Dowden 's literary criticism stemmed from his desire not merely to endorse the empire but to defend the Union and the culture of Anglicanism in Ireland Thus although intellectually a post-Darwinian doubter Dowden wrote in his influential study of Shakespeare 's Mind and Art it may be asserted without hesitation that the Protestant type of character and the Protestant polity in state and nation is that which has received impulse and vigour from the mind of the greatest of English poets, energy, devotion to the fact, tolerance Similarly Dowden regarded Shakespeare 's history plays as exemplifying how the noblest practical life may be achieved This was in the Adam Smith tradition and led Yeats to call Dowden a British Benthamite At the same time Yeats contextualised Dowden 's version of Shakespeare by saying he lived in Ireland where everything had failed and he meditated frequently on the perfection of character which had he thought made England successful Later Dowden worked very hard for the Irish Unionist Alliance, a lobby against Home Rule Another coincidence between his literary and political interests was an appeal he addressed to selected London literati He records,  I wrote to Swinburne, Kipling and Alfred Austin for songs for Unionists in Ireland Swinburne at once sent the song It had something about black as creed of priest, which I objected would not do for our Catholic Unionists He replied that his text could be changed Beast took the place of priest    Kipling wrote that if the song came to him he 'd send it, but he thought we needed drilling a damned sight more than doggerel    I replied that the two were not incompatible  In his essay Edward Dowden Irish Victorian, Terence Brown notices contradictions between Dowden 's openness to the intellectual currents of his age, including his enthusiasm for Walt Whitman as the poet of democracy, and Dowden 's hostility to the Irish Literary Revival The clash between Yeats and Dowden was in fact a significant moment for what we would now term centre and margin Although Dowden encouraged the youthful Yeats and admired his poetry he refused to write about Irish authors despite Yeats 's urging Earlier in eighteen seventy-four Dowden had urged the poet Aubrey de Vere not to let so great a subject as Thomas a\\ Becket drop for the sake of any Irish heroic subject And he did not wish his own poetry, heavily influenced by Wordsworth to be published in quote a specially Irish anthology insisting that it came out of the general mother, earth Evidently, Dowden claims an archetypal origin for his poetry lest it should prove to be racy with Irish rather than English soil Yet of course the Irish Literary Revival was not so securely rooted itself Its brand of cultural nationalism was criticised both by political Nationalism and by the Gaelic League Thus by historical irony some of Yeats 's views after Irish independence call up Dowden 's ghost For example in the eighteen nineties Yeats had annoyed Dowden when he discounted the Anglo-Irish writers of the eighteenth century By the later nineteen twenties, disillusioned by the policies of the Free State, Yeats was mythologising these writers as his ancestral stair And indeed studies of the revival often stressed the degree to which it was shaped by distinctively Irish Protestant mentalities", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id": "2c022189-ef01-4cb3-8045-6f5935bd3397", "added": "2023-09-21T17:45:02.431761+00:00"}

of an hour I 've spoken for half an hour When I 've been asked to speak for twenty minutes I speak for fifteen minutes Now I 've been asked to speak for eight minutes and you can get your stopwatches out I 'm greatly honoured to be standing here participating in this ceremony with so many young and I hope, hopeful people I use the word \" hopeful \" because it 's a word connected to the young, the energetic, those at the threshold, those unfatigued by the stress of living Hope is the mainstay of the writer I hope I will finish the novel I 'm writing I hope someone will publish it I hope that having got it published the critics will notice its existence I hope that someone will read it And then the greatest hope of all, I hope I will one day write another novel, that I will feel the stirrings and anxieties of a new creation in my head, very much like a woman feeling the stirrings and anxieties of new life growing in her belly I get the feeling that the majority of people think that writing is easy It 's well for you, they say, just sitting at home writing all day They seem to think it 's like a holiday, sitting there at the typewriter, inspiration relentlessly driving your fingers over the keys Of course it 's not like that at all and I hope that any aspiring writers amongst you don't have any notions that it might be Inspiration never comes unasked for It never walks in your hall door without knocking and calls yoo-hoo I 'm here The coupling of the head and the imagination can be quite fierce, quite painful, before the seed of an idea is set in the brain After the birth, the  the idea which I may say gestates for months indeed sometimes painfully for years, has like an infant to be fed, and cared for, nurtured, clothed and guided through a million pitfalls until it reaches the stage you have all now reached when hopefully it is launched onto the world At last it takes on its own life and the author is free to start once more to await with hope another birth One of the few advantages of being a woman in the world of writing is that you recognise so well each symptom, each setback You can perhaps cope better with your recalcitrant offspring You know when to coax, when to read the riot act, when to applaud achievement A novel is not a text That was to have been my text for this address or small sermon But when I mentioned it to my daughter who is a university lecturer in Dublin her reply was, but it is So that put the kibosh on that In her way, she is right, but also from my point of view, so am I What I really want to say to you is that you have now after many years been liberated from the world of texts, from the pressures of exams, essays, dissertations You are now free to read whatever and however you wish For so many years you 've been guided through the treasure store of our literature, and when I say \" our \" I mean the gamut of work written in these two islands, from Chaucer, Milton, Keats, to Yeats and now Seamus Heaney, Derek Mahon, Michael Longley and so many others From Rosalinde and the Sentimental Journey through Ulysses, to Ripley Bogle, and even The Commitments So many words, so many ideas, so many flights of the imagination It 's a rich and astonishing cultural mixture It is our luggage that we carry with us all our lives, joyfully At least, I carry it joyfully You 've been taught over these last years how to read, how to discover the complexities of a text, how to uncover the mysteries of language You 've also probably been taught things about those texts that all too often the writers had no notion of themselves when they wrote the sentences on the pages The author gives birth to the lively infant which grows to become an adult, spirited and free Then, sometimes even before it has time to grow gracefully old, it becomes a text, prone on the dissecting table, all angles and orifices examined and probed, joints checked, heart , monitored, theories, judgements, diagnoses Will the patient live or die Does the patient deserve to live, or shall we perform solemn euthanasia Who will we embalm Who leave to rot The patient will survive in spite of such treatment, and I believe that the student will also survive to , to perhaps become as reader in the real sense of the word, to perhaps become astonished constantly by what he or she finds between the covers of a novel or a book of poetry A galaxy of stars, a stony path, a mountain, a time bomb, always truth and always the heart that even the most skilful dissection cannot stop beating To get back to the beginning, which is what I was always taught you should do at the end of an essay and therefore I suppose it should also be due at the end of an address or sermon, I am hopeful for you, that maybe some of you may with your hope and energy change the world, and on the way to your doing that I hope that you will read more than a few books Thank-you", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source": "ice_HELM", "id":

{"text": "<Socialist politics>\n\n\n<$A> Comrades, friends, international guests, I, am a socialist, and I have news for those, who want to bury socialism  There is no, corpse for their coffin  Socialism is alive, and it dwells in the hearts of people It survives as the hope for a better life It 's the heart of our heartless world But my intention tonight, is not, to comfort you with soothing phrases It 's to challenge you to greater effort, to greater commitment in a proud cause, I no more than anyone else this time last year, predicted that the year ahead of us would be so remarkable The Berlin Wall fell, and the Iron Curtain, of tanks and missiles was redundant But even before those extraordinary events, we notched up our own historic breakthrough We won seven seats in the Da/il and our first seat in the European Parliament In my speech at last year 's A/rd Fheis, I urged you to look searchingly at some sacred cows And I know I shocked you, with what I said about socialism And I asked you to  those arguments, and you took me at my word And indeed that speech itself, has now been, reinterpreted let 's say in the afterglow of what has happened in the east There are now those who argue that the Workers ' Party must ditch, some of its socialist values if it 's not to be, put onto the margins of Irish politics We are told that it was only my speech last year that brought about our electoral victories, and comrades to believe that, would not only be a self-delusion, but it would be a denial of your work, your commitment, the work that you have put into this party all over these long years knocking on doors campaigning and winning support for this party  It is your party and your victory  It is also a denial, of the capacity of people, the people out there who we are trying to win It 's a denial of their capacity to make free choices, to make up their minds about what packaged material is being offered to them, and to make clear intelligent choices and not be swayed by the latest sensation It was your dedication over the years that brought us our victories Those victories were the result of hundreds, of small achievements that were won over many weeks many months and many years They were won by you, our supporters and friends who have cast their lot with us in the battle for a better future Our strength lies with you and the work you do, and indeed, in the, commitment and integrity of the party and the belief of the people in the integrity of the party Socialists of course are optimists We tend to see the bottle, half full instead of half empty Despite all the difficulties we see the marvellous opportunities there are, to give new meaning and substance to our struggles Socialism lives despite Stalinism and despite Thatcherism It 's an ideal that cannot be defeated because it it is an idea that is central to the human experience an aspiration to justice to freedom from oppression and exploitation, and it has flowered in the darkest hours of history, in every part of the world There is no need deeper, no desire stronger than that that cries out for a world that is based on respect for human values, for equity for work co-operation and sharing among the citizens, in every society under every form of repression the seed of this idea has taken root Again and again it has struggled into the light of day And the expression, of that idea, is a commitment to socialist politics Do the would-be gravediggers of socialism, Bush, and Thatcher and let us not forget our own, Mr Haughey who is at this point in time parading around the world stage, in his borrowed presidential robes, telling us how the West has won Can they truly imagine that their petty vulgar views of the world have prevailed A world where greed is god The seedy carpetbaggers who are now swarming across the face of Eastern Europe, like all the political barbarians before them, are hunting for their own advantage They have no grasp of what has gone before, no idea of the massive suffering and sacrifice of millions, no conception of the colossal efforts of each age in turn, to take one step closer, to human liberation It is true, that the collapse of communist regimes, and the radical reassessment of socialist society in history, has dealt a mortal blow to those who gave blind uncritical support to the Eastern bloc And let me say it is a valid criticism of our party, that we did not more publicly criticise the defects we saw in communist countries But it would be totally unprincipled to join the chorus that uses the collapse of communist regimes to assist those who are trying to deny the need for an alternative to the inhuman capitalist system  It 's a system, which treats the human being and the labour of  human beings and the resources of this earth as simply raw   for their own, profit and power The big risk of our current preoccupations is, that as the continent of Europe, enters a period of political change unprecedented since the First World War, that we will turn inwards on ourselves, towards a greater European chauvinism, which turns its back on the people, of Africa, of Asia and of Latin America, If already inadequate amounts of Third aid Third World aid and are are  cut to meet the needs of the states in eastern Europe, then the new dawn in Europe, will come to represent a nightmare, for the majority of the people on this planet Aid and development for the Third World have to be at the centre of the concerns of a broadly progressive European politics For we must realise, that what demonstrates most powerfully the conflict between uncontrolled market forces and a decent sustainable existence for all the people of the world is the treadmill of low prices, for primary commodities with for massive debt and the poverty of the peoples of the Third World That is the conflict which is basic to the difference between socialism and capitalism No, socialism is not dead What has died is pseudo-socialism because it lacked the essential component of democracy Stalinism is dead Systems imposed on unwilling people, who have never been consulted are dead too And anyone who feels that that type of pseudo-socialism, can be revived by its pretending to be something else for a while and re-emerging from the ashes like a phoenix, is dead from the neck up What we have seen happening in eastern Europe, has been an upsurge of the popular will We have seen the people take power, from the entrenched and corrupt bureaucrats, who thought that there could be socialism without democracy, who thought that they knew better than the people what was good for them What we have been privileged to witness, is the birth of a realisation, by ordinary working people, that they are the real possessors of power, if they would but use it It is not just Eastern Europe that has seen great political change in the past year Nowhere has the change been more dramatic or more welcome than in South Africa, where it is now clear that we are witnessing the beginning of the end, of the vile and detested apartheid system Nelson Mandela is free from his conventional prison and soon, the people of South Africa will be free from the prison of apartheid  And let me say, that for all the flaws and there are many, of the East European states, they have proved more responsive to popular pressure, than many of the states that trumpet their support for the values of the free market South Africa is a free market, which has not prevented but in fact is part of the appalling oppression of the vast majority of the people there Tens of thousands of people have been jailed or killed in central America by regimes, who claim to be free market regimes In El Salvador, which tolerates no dissent, and who are lavishly financed and supported by the   States But the one beacon of hope, in that region has been Nicaragua The Sandinista  revolution, in Nicaragua, was a brave experiment, which was massively popular, and which brought significant improvements to the social and economic conditions of the people of Nicaragua It was we know, brought to the verge of collapse by sustained military and economic pressure from the United States But the Sandinistas have proved their democratic credentials They have handed over power to the victors in the election recently held in Nicaragua But they will be back The people will win once more in Nicaragua and we will give them all the help that we can give them to do that  The lesson, for our age, is that socialism, if it is to succeed, must have democracy as its essence It must base itself first of all on the primary needs of human beings, the need for peace and security, for a caring society, and for a careful economy It must have as its primary aim, the development of forms of production which no longer regards human beings and the world merely as raw materials to be exploited, and which no longer simply fills needs only if there is a profit to be made out of it for someone In Haughey 's Ireland, as in Thatcher 's Britain, healthcare is a market commodity If you don't have the money, you don't get the service If you do have the money, you can have all the treatment you want, and indeed in the lap of luxury if you choose to have it Education, is a market commodity This means that if you have the money, you can buy the best education for your children It means if you don't have the money, then your children will get a barely adequate education, and they will remain poor, unless they are lucky, or if they are brilliant Now treating services like these, as market commodities leads inevitably, to permanent disadvantage And that is something the marketeers can live with, but it 's something we cannot live with, and we won't live with it  When the market is not, under democratic control, it   controls politics It will dictate to people how they live, and where they can live It will dictate their access to learning, their access to healthcare, and indeed even their access to culture There are many everyday examples, of political and popular issues being turned into mere market commodities The most recent example, is the greening of business The advertising agencies have discovered, that for business, green is good So every possible product and retail outlet is been being presented in the greenest possible light Even British Nuclear Fuels,  have spent twenty million pounds, to tell us, that this is really the alternative, to global warming, So, how else do we can we see the effects of this green being good for business Have you seen your shelves in the supermarkets lately They are stacked with products for which spurious claims are being made, about preservatives, about artificial colourings and about what and about CFCs What is  urgently needed is a statutory system of labelling, so that the consumer can be sure that the claims being made are not bogus Bogus green labelling of course is not confined to the supermarket shelf It is also to be found in political life Some parties have now found, a new green flag, to wrap around their jaded politics While Fianna Fa/il Councillors, are busy abusing their powers, re-zoning and destroying greenbelts, and while the European Parliament is taking twenty-one actions against the Irish Government for failure to implement environmental  regulations, what does our Taoiseach do He markets himself as the Green President of Europe Clearly a case, of bogus labelling   But despite all the hype about the environment, it has been the Workers

ability to represent people, of every interest or background We have enabled the Irish people, to bypass the sterility of divisive class politics, no matter how often the leopard tries to change his spots, or its agenda  Instead, instead we have a tradition of consultation with all sections of society We have to build on that tradition of social partnership We have to listen, listen to what our people are really thinking and saying The old certainties are gone We are living in a complex world We are a member of an international community We face challenges, that are complicated, difficult and subtle, challenges that the old certainties won't meet Yes we have beliefs, and we 'll not abandon them Yes we have traditions, and we 'll not forget them And yes we have values We will not betray those values  But now we need more much more Fianna Fa/il has a vocation to be the party of modernisation, but still reflecting the deep attachment of the Irish people, to their own identity and ideals Let me tell you what I believe this party is going to have to show to the country in the next few years Openness, resolution, creativity, professionalism, and commitment Openness, is not just in our dealings with media although that is important We have to have a new openness, in dealing with each other Why Because differences of opinion are good for us It is unrealistic to expect that all members of such a great party, would agree with each other all the time When I selected my cabinet, I clearly did not select people, who would agree with each other all the time, and they quickly proved me right   This, this country does not need to speak with one voice, but what we do need, is the openness to listen to the voices we do not agree with Openness goes further Openness means not wasting time pretending that problems do not exist, or that mistakes have not been made We are seeking to do everything We are not now seeking to do everything on our own That time is gone The future is about consensus, about welcoming good ideas no matter where they come from The future is also about fair dealing, no inside tracks, no privileged circles, the same rules should apply to everybody, and the rewards should go to energy, hard work and professionalism  I , I intend, I intend to demand and apply only the highest standards Government will be for the benefit of all It will be progressive, enlightened and socially caring Providing a fair deal for everybody It will be characterised by a spirit of reform Hence the slogan for this A/rd Fheis, A New Beginning A new beginning in every aspect of our approach within the party, within the Government, within the cabinet But it cannot be just for this A/rd Fheis It cannot be just a slogan Ireland is looking for more from the or  more of that from us A new Ireland is growing up on all sides, an Ireland that is rightly impatient with slow with slow progress, with complacent ways, with fixed attitudes This Ireland has new aspirations, new potential Uh if we are to match those aspirations, then we need a new sense of purpose, a new confidence, a new energy, a brand new beginning,  This party, this party is a marvellous national talent bank No other party has the variety of views, the wealth of experience, the practical understanding that Fianna Fa/il has No other party And our talent has been added to lately And here I must welcome back old friends, who had temporarily left us and who have reappeared at meetings all around this country  But if but if we are a huge talent bank, then we have got to manage that talent properly That means new structures to make our work more relevant and effective new structures to make Fianna Fa/il the powerhouse of progress at local and national level Our finances have to be put right We have the plan to do it, Getting the money in is going to call for a concerted effort on all our parts Making better use of the money, is going to be a high priority We are in the business of politics, so we 're going to have to be businesslike, in the way we manage our money Tighter controls, no lavish spending on advertising that we simply cannot afford  Streamlining the organisation is another priority Over the next few months the report of the party commission, will be carefully considered by all units of our organisation We know we need to change Now we have some suggestions as to what those changes may be That report, has some new aims for the party, as well as reaffirming and amplifying many of our basic aims Let me tell you, that I have one simple aim, and I want this party to share it with me An aim that allows us to give this country, the coherent sustained principled government it needs and deserves That aim is very clear Very clear even though very difficult And it will demand unselfish commitment from each and every one of us You know what uh that uh aim is I know what that aim is That aim is single-party government  I have no difficulty in working with our partners in Government No difficulty whatsoever But I will not allow anybody to think, that Fianna Fa/il needs another party to keep it on the right track  I, I will not allow anybody to think, that Fianna Fa/il needs another party as its conscience,  And I will not allow anybody to think, that Fianna Fa/il needs to get its direction, from another party, from any other party  Fianna Fa/il is the biggest most broadly-based party in this State, with a proud history, and with a track record second to none And Fianna Fa/il must always aim, at providing stable single-party government for this nation Single-party government must be our alternative, to any incoherent, multi-party, Rainbow Coalition  In the, in the immediate future, we have a number of serious problems, Problems that will not go away Let me now turn to one of the most important, unemployment The greatest challenge we face in the nineties, the one that will show if we succeed as a society, is to create more jobs here at home Jobs for those of our young people who want to work in Ireland This is an even stiffer task than the one we faced in nineteen eighty-seven of putting the public finances back on the rails and making our economy fundamentally sound We must start by recognising the size of the problem Two hundred and eighty thousand of our people are without work Almost as many over the last ten years, have had no choice but to leave this country in search of work As a result, families were broken up, and tight-knit communities suffered Growth in employment in recent good years, just has not been good enough to keep up, with the growth in the labour force And in the bad years, unemployment has rapidly escalated Economic growth is not translating into greater employment It should, but it isn't, but it is not And indeed with the expert advice that we 're trying to find out and we will find out why is that So we have got to look at employment afresh, without any of the old assumptions or hopes Creating employment is a national challenge, not just a challenge for a government So I have decided to include, not just the social partners, but the political parties as well, through the creation of an all-party committee on employment That committee is going to call in  outside expertise, listen to representative views and work with the social partners in NESC In effect the Oireachtas itself, is going to be our employment forum, and final details will be announced in the Da/il next week But  but there is going to be a lot more than talk Action will happen as recommended by the Industrial Review body, and that action will be spearheaded, by a special taskforce But  let there be no doubt on one thing, an absolute pre-condition of progress is that we maintain our economic fundamentals in good shape Low inflation, low borrowing, a stable exchange rate, a healthy balance of payments and positive growth Those are the things we need as a framework of stability, for forward and strategic planning Fianna Fa/il has shown, it can be done Look at our record since nineteen eighty-seven For the past five years we have been able to sustain a growth rate, averaging almost five percent And we have maintained positive growth in the face of prolonged recession, in Britain and the United States We will meet any budgetary difficulty that comes along We will stay on course to achieve a hundred percent debt GNP ratio by nineteen ninety-three Over time the proportion of national resources, devoted to servicing the debt will come down further That will let us benefit from reduced interest rate payments But above all this planned tightly controlled progress, will sustain confidence, because it will show that we are relentlessly resolved to have at all times, a strong and professionally managed economy We must eliminate the many disincentives to work in both the tax and the social welfare systems A clear transparent tax system is more equitable than one full of hidden loopholes The tax reform I began in nineteen eighty-nine is going to continue, with the emphasis shifting in the medium term, to a broadening of the bands While lower personal taxation is important for competitiveness, Irish people, want a decent quality of public services We will not implement tax cuts at the expense of essential needs, such as health education housing or provision for the old and the unemployed  As someone who built up and conducted my own business, I am convinced that there is scope for greatly improving efficiency across the public sector In some cases the best methods are not used In other cases the public does not get the best value because of the anxiety to achieve this particular objective, and because of insufficient commercial experience Public servants are not always deployed to best effect, leading to a waste of energy, talent and experience The Irish people deserve a better deal Sharpening up the management and delivery of state services is high on my priority list By continuing to improve our competitiveness, and reducing costs, we improve our attractiveness as a location for investment We also enable our indigenous industries to improve their performance We need better linkages with industry to develop sub-supply, for example to the motor industry, and to build up small clusters of firms, exploiting a niche in the international market We will also enable our indigenous industries such as fishing and forestry to improve their performance Fianna Fa/il have been particularly successful in promoting tourism, but there is still  great potential for further expansion, The tourism taskforce is the latest initiative, in an unremitting search for new ways of increasing its value and employment potential We need to remove the obstacles, which prevent or discourage tourists from coming in here in larger numbers, or for longer periods Like tourism, remote data processing is another example It is a labour-intensive sector which should be fully exploited, to promote new job opportunities in both urban and rural  areas\n\n\n<$A> Job training and work experience have also a role to play in easing unemployment, as have the new area base schemes Only last week, we gained EEC approval for new employment and training schemes for up to twenty-five thousand people this year As I have said unemployment is the problem It is the problem that is causing potential to be lost and dreams to dissipate Young lives are being hedged in by hopelessness Older people are finding themselves unemployed for longer and longer sadder and sadder periods That is not good enough Now I am not saying that there is a ready solution a simple solution But what I am saying, is that we must seek out and act upon every potential opportunity for job creation in both the public and the private sector We will be seeking out major development projects and proceeding with them What I am saying, is that we must rely more on ourselves and not on outside forces to solve our problems And what I am promising this party  and what I am promising this party is that all our policies from now on will be formulated with a focus on employment Employment, yes that has to be the number one priority for this government and for this party I want  I want to  to turn now to farming which for Ireland is both an industry and a way of life Agriculture remains our primary natural resource It plays a crucial part in the national economy It produces the vast majority of Ireland 's two billion pound annual trade surplus CAP reform and GATT talks need to be brought quickly to a satisfactory conclusion We desperately need a stable framework for the future So we will be fighting for a balanced outcome that will enable commercial farming to continue while encouraging the small farmer to stay on the land We 'll be seeking to push forward the policy of rural development under the leader programme, so as to improve the viability of life in our countryside Given the increasing importance of EEC income supports, we 'll be fighting to get for this country the maximum eligible amount We 'll be fighting to have it paid to farmers within a reasonable period And we 'll be fighting against the type of bureaucracy that treats a minor unintended error in an application as if it were a major fraud  Aggressive marketing, has to play a major part in our food industry for the future Excessive reliance on intervention provides no long-term security We have got to get out there and sell Open up or re-open the Middle East markets That 's why the new Minister for Foreign Affairs was in Iran this week And as you all know he did not come home empty-handed  But overall, overall the state of our vital beef industry remains a cause for concern We need regular outlets for our beef as well as our sheep This country must become a value-added economy We must redouble our efforts to create a modern processing

{"text": "<Budget speech>\n\n\n<$A> I am today making an additional net provision of eleven million pounds so as to achieve an average participation of thirty-eight thousand five hundred this year,  Ceann Comhairle, the Government 's policy agreement contains a commitment to payment of the legally-determined entitlements of married women to social welfare equality payments We undertook that a, that a budget and a timescale for the payments would be set out having regard to budgetary constraints, and the costs involved, and that the process will be completed within four years The judgement of the High Court in this matter was delivered last Friday the third of February The judgement will require careful consideration by the Government, advised by the Attorney General giving the costs and the importance of the legal issues involved While it has not been possible fully to complete that consideration I am including a provision of sixty million pounds as a first step this year  As a first step this year Should it prove necessary to spend more on these exceptional payments this year  there are funding possibilities open to me through the disposal of State assets,  My budget target for the EBR would not then be increased by making further payments And the assets I will consider disposing of are not in the commercial semi-state bodies,\n\n<$C> Watch this space\n<$D> Read my lips\n<$A> Ceann Comhairle, the ceasefire of the thirty-first of August last has continued to underpin and deepen the Peace Process in this island of Ireland The fear between neighbours North and South has been gradually reduced To speed up this process, and in the interests of our neighbours, I propose to extend the free travel scheme to include pensioners in Northern Ireland undertaking cross-border journeys\n<$X> Hear-hear \n<$E> Well done\n<$A> The existing free travel arrangements for pensioners in this part of the island will also be improved to put them on a similar basis This means in effect \n<$B> Please \n<$A> <&Irish> A </&Irish> Leas-Cheann Comhairle\n<$F> <unclear> several words </unclear>\n<$B> We heard please\n<$A> <&Irish> A </&Irish> Leas-Cheann Comhairle this means Nice one Michael but it wasn't Nice one but it wasn't, This means in effect that Doctor Ian Paisley can travel for free on CIE/ and I hope that he does,  <&Irish> A </&Irish> Leas-Cheann Comhairle,  <&Irish> A </&Irish> Leas-Cheann Comhairle, beyond Ireland 's shores many parts of the world, many parts of the world are unfortunately enduring war, pestilence, and hunger In the Third World,  famine has become a plague in a world of plenty Irish people have instinctively responded to this human tragedy Many Irish organisations are actively involved  on the ground in trying to alleviate this human plight Our response is out of all proportion to our numbers Perhaps it is because we still carry with us , as President Robinson said last Thursday, some memory for the horror of our Great Famine which began this spring one hundred and fifty years ago I intend to mark that anniversary by providing tax relief at the standard rate on donations by individuals to designated Irish Third World charities\n<$X> Hear-hear Well done\n<$A> Taxpayers will be able to mark to make their contributions in the range of two hundred to seven hundred and fifty pounds to the designated Third World charity of their choice That body will receive the tax associated with the contribution from the Revenue Commissioners This means that a donation of seven hundred and fifty pounds will be worth just over a thousand pounds to the charity concerned\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> This new measure will for the first time allow people to exercise choice with regard to the agency to which they wish, to which they wish the State to contribute part of our official development assistance We are committed in the programme for government to increase each year our ODA This measure will help us to continue to do that as the tax component of the donations will form part of our ODA assistance The tax component of the assistance In addition I 'm introducing arrangements which for the future will enable time spent on voluntary work abroad for the agency for personnel service overseas by Irish public servants on a limited basis to be reckonable for pension purposes\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> These measures will further strengthen the links of support and solidarity between this country and the Third World  Many of our county roads are in poor condition The changing  the changing pattern the changing pattern of  of use and the increased weight of agribusiness trucks have taken their toll on traditional roads which have poor foundations The recent bad weather and flooding has aggravated this already difficult situation As an immediate, as an immediate response I 'm providing eight million pounds extra this year which will bring the total exchequer allocation to over one hundred million for this purpose in ninety-five,  In addition the Minister for the Environment as a matter of urgency will prepare a report for Government   on  the situation This report which will be completed within a matter of months will enable us to develop a coherent and integrated plan to bring our county roads up to an acceptable standard over the next ten years The Government 's policy agreement contained a promise, contained a promise to continue with the initiative to reduce hospital waiting lists I 'm providing eight million pounds for this purpose in nineteen ninety-five The arts, the arts are playing an important role in developing our culture, promoting Ireland abroad, and providing employment at home I am providing additional funding of two million pounds for the Arts Council,  <&Irish> A </&Irish> Leas-Cheann Comhairle it is important that we as a nation, it is important that we as a nation can collectively enjoy our rich cultural heritage I therefore intend to introduce a special tack  tax relief for donations to national collections of important heritage items including paintings The details of this will be published in the Finance Bill And I propose to provide additional funding of two point three million for tourism promotion, three point five million for preparatory work related to Ireland 's presidency of the European Union in nineteen ninety-six, and two point one million for certain sporting, cultural, and social projects details of which are set out in the principal features The government have decided to phase out over two years fees for third level undergraduate students in publicly-funded colleges and to abolish fees for post-Leaving Certificate courses\n<$B>  Without interruption  \n<$X> Hear-hear \n<$A> Details of this important change will be given today by my colleague the Minister for Education In conjunction with this change I am extending the restrictions which currently apply to  to parent-child covenants to all covenants This entails the application of a five percent income limit and the abolition of tax relief on covenanting on covenanting to minor children other than incapacitated children These changes will apply to new covenants taken out on or after today and to existing covenants from the sixth of April next In addition, from next year, when fees are abolished I will be abolishing tax relief on covenants generally Tax relief will be retained for certain covenants including those for the elderly and incapacitated as set out in the principal features The changes do not affect covenants for maintenance payments between separated spouses Provision will be made for tax relief on fees paid to private colleges in respect of approved courses This relief will be introduced for the academic year ninety-six ninety-seven And it is also intended that maintenance grants under the higher education grant scheme will be extended to approved courses being followed by Irish students abroad with effect from ninety-six ninety-seven academic year,  <&Irish> A </&Irish> Leas-Cheann Comhairle I propose to make no changes in VAT rates or their coverage today Existing arrangements will of course continue to be kept under review having regard to both domestic and European Union considerations In the excise area I propose to seek an additional revenue contribution from a tax increase of twelve pence on a packet of twenty cigarettes, with pro rata increases on other tobacco products which will apply from midnight tonight  This this this adjustment, this adjustment which will assist the financial and government priorities in other areas should not give rise to cross-border trade diversion or unduly to inflation, Leas-Cheann Comhairle I intend to introduce a scheme which will give a vehicle registration tax relief of one thousand pounds where a car at least ten years old is scrapped and the owner purchases a new vehicle  Schemes of this nature which can have environmental advantages have been employed with success in other countries The proposed measure will be once-off running from the first of July ninety-five to the end of next year It will apply in relation to those older cars which at the time of purchase of the new car have been continuously road-taxed and insured by the purchaser of the new car over the previous two year period The cost,  the cost of the various taxation and PRSI measures I have announced is a hundred and fifty-nine million pounds while expenditure additions total a hundred and forty-three million pounds The budget targets already indicated take into account these costs and the effects on revenue buoyancy of the totality of the measures announced today These targets reflect the commitment of this Government to be  to the prudent budgetary strategy set out in the Government 's programme Leas-Cheann Comhairle while I acknowledge that this year 's budget is benefiting from certain once-off factors the absence of which will generate pressures in future years, I want to confirm that the central direction of this budget will underpin the policy of this Government as set out in the Programme for Renewal over the next two years We will need firm discipline and strict adherence to our commitments if we are to meet the targets which we have set for ourselves in the policy document, The Government of Renewal I 'm therefore inviting people, inviting people to begin to plan for the future within the parameters which are contained in this budget as set out in the Government 's programme The provision of certainty in a rapidly-changing world is one of the major positive components which a government can provide to a community which needs to plan and wants to invest In this regard the existence of the social partnership and the framework for dialogue and consultation which it provides is an essential part of our way of doing business The existence of the PCW, the National Development Plan, and the commitment of this Government to maintain its budget strategy, which I have outlined here today, provides a secure future within which I am inviting you the Irish people to plan and to invest  And I 'm now inviting you to do more, because planning for the next three years is not enough We need to lift our eyes and focus upon the horizon of the near future which shall take us into the next century The year twenty ten is only fifteen years away which may seem a long time looking forward but it is as close to us as nineteen eighty when you look back And you all know how recent that year was and so you can all understand how near to us now is the near future of twenty ten Our political, economic, and social energies must be co-ordinated together to focus upon a set of goals which we can aspire to and which we can also achieve Nobody else is going to do this for us As a sovereign people we must do it for ourselves In fifteen years ' time I believe that Ireland should and can have the average per capita income of the European Union\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> Provide full employment for all those seeking work, have the best preserved and the best managed environment of the European Union\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> Possess the most efficient and effective public administration in Europe and be perceived outside Europe as the best place in which to invest and do business within Europe\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> These goals, these goals which can only be achieved with leadership, teamwork, and imagination will if implemented transform our  transform our lives   and the lives of all Irish  people who will come after us\n<$B>  Please let us hear the Minister  \n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> All of the components required to enable us to achieve these goals are within our own control We are truly at last a sovereign people What we need to do now, is to begin to exercise that sovereignty I believe that the we we can build a society that admires success, rewards work, celebrates excellence and also promotes opportunity\n<$X> Hear-hear\n<$A> Demands equality and meets misfortune with compassion and with solidarity\n<$X> Hear-hear Hear-hear", "subdomain": "IRELAND_S_ALL", "source":
